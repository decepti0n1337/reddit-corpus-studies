I played earlier (4-5:30pm E) and had two disconnects. One was during a SBQ event where there was some good loot and it all got wiped out and reset to the world I was previously in.

---
Sneak bloodied melee using carnivore buffs is the largest possible damage in the game.
---
Of course, yes.... well besides on a Monday, but that is for another  thread.
---
Failure? Buckles seat belt "This is ganna get bumpy"
---
You really seem like a racist.
---
Don’t worry. They’ve fixed the Photomode frame where Vault Boy held a Laser Musket. He now wields a Laser Rifle. Balance has been restored. The game is fixed!
---
Wait Vampire Gatling Plasmas are legacy?
---
I’ve thought of trying this again but i really don’t know. I sunk 200+ hours into the game and I felt like I got nowhere. There was no sense of achieving anything. Regardless of what the bugs were, the constant dropping from servers, problems trying to play with friends and just whatever other shit I hope would be gone by now but it’s that feeling of not completing anything I disliked most.
---
I like to do this but the camp building system doesn’t really want you to with all the fancy walls and furniture. I can’t tell if they didn’t implement better “apocalyptic” building items out of laziness or because they want us to be rebuilding america
---
Yea no thanks I'm not rich enough to do that though I wouldn't mind drop herb for carnivore
---
Where csn I see this stream everyone’s talking about
---
However you wanna look at it mod support has carried these games lol
---
No one is holding you hostage, drama queen, just stop playing.
---
Good for you! you put a "kid" dowwn on the internet, have a good night .
---
Nothing wrong if you dont figure it took me 100+ hrs to collect my 110k steel and they want it for a hat. I guess.
---
I have heard if you can do it on a private server or a server that no one else has turned it in yet it will work
---
*down

---
Would you like to eat some ivy?
---
My understanding was they experienced the FT bug, got a Furious Rolling Pin, and got wiped out? That’s what I’ve gathered just from people commenting as I haven’t even seen it yet
---
E: oh, and they’re all bloodied builds
---
11 caps for everything, 50 for power armor peices.
---
Are you sure? I went back to the article they posted about it after I saw another post earlier complaining about it and the picture shows no headgear whatsoever, just the outfit we got. I never saw any evidence we were supposed to get anything other than exactly what we got. Don't get me wrong, I'm the last person to defend the incompetence of Bethesda, but this time it doesn't look like they fucked up, other than the dummy item in the Atom Shop which for all we know was made first before they decided they were just going to release the outfit only. I certainly don't trust any CM saying they are "looking into it" as they say that about everything when in reality nothing gets done.
---
I played back in those days but seeing as you told me you pay for fallout first there's nothing more to discuss.
---
Is there a video link for this? I didn't get to see it live
---
I know one handed is not as good as unarmed / two handed, so I'm banking on more sweet deals! :P
---
But really, I just find it so fun to get so many sneak hits in at a time. Before the hatchet I rocked some shittier cultist dagger with nothing noteworthy other than faster swing speed and nothing stood a chance but the SBQ. That vamp faster swing speed dagger sounds like the perfect backup weapon if I ever find one.
---
If your high level  (I'm 120 on Xbox but I hate seeing this) please don't just walk into places like the race track and take it from some low level just so you can pick on them. They're trying to get resources and usually minding they're own business. Also low levels need to stop. Picking peoples doors to bases. Though I'm not getting tired of Mini nuking them when they do. If a door is locked they don't want you there.
---
You should join the enclave

IGN is streaming the conference on Youtube.  If you rewind the video, you can take a look at it.
---
One of the silos (I forgot which one exactly) have a mountain right next to it. If you stand on that mountain and look in the direction of the silo, you’ll see the missile launching. 
---
Sorry if this is not helpful because I don’t know the exact location, but if you don’t find an answer then I consider visiting the silo I mentioned
---
I wasn't aware that was a thing.
---
Really? That sounds fun, but after so much sneaking from fallout 4 and halfway through 76 I'm kinda tired of not drawing attention. Plus I don't have the agility for it, a lot of my perks is in strength and perception. Though I could tone down perception for agility. I'm not sure, I'll keep experimenting as I go on.
---
Regardless, thank you for the idea!
---
I just got a berzerk explosive handy today
---
need to address connection issues
---
being from server more and more disconnected at queen and encrypted
---
whole team today , 8 people yesterday
---
every day  -this is new blue screen
---
cannot fast travel with 3 attempts
---
stop add things to game , till fix  the seriously issues
---
try remove the useless event prize and trash armor and weapons and ammo .
---
Workshops aren’t even worth taking, tbh. I only pick one up now if it’s both vacant and required for a challenge. 
---
The defend events are something I’ll assist with for the xp, and they’re more fun now with the xp SCORE goals.
---
He's a weirdo who gets off starting fights on the internet. Don't take anything he says personally.
---
I heard that bloody is getting nerfed (right as I switched to it). Is this true?
---
This is a huge event for Bethesda and fallout is probably one their biggest IP..
---
And we got no new announcement lol
---
I did a solid earlier today. Level 19 player shows up at my camp at the Seneca Rocks, and asks where they can get power armor. Their voice sounds really young. I don't have voice, but I did the Follow Me gesture... and escorted them down to the uranium mine near Whitespring, where, luckily, a power armor frame and some armor were waiting to be picked up.   
---
Glad luck was on my side-- I'd have felt awful if there was no power armor there-- and happy to do stuff like this once in a while.
---
I really enjoying finding new players and helping them out.  I struggled when I started back in beta.  I found this kid when he was level 14 and I have helped him make it to level 50.  I am currently 2 hours in trying to collect enough flux to craft him a jet pack for his Ultracite armor.  If you see me on and need any help feel free to hit me up.  Xbox gamertag is AirWolfe70. Be happy to help anyone I can.
---
You've made errors in English too; like continually using it. You should stop that.
---
Darn. I was hoping they'd experience the travel bug where a countdown keeps popping up but gets canceled immediately, or the respawn bug where you're technically alive but the game is telling you to respawn, or the respawn bug where you're encumbered and can't respawn or teleport.

They had a twitch stream that was so cringeworthy and showed off every major issue people were having. It was way worse than this one
---
I build mine to be a one stop shop for passing low level vault dwellers, and the same during Fasnacht since my building is the first thing you see when you fast travel to Helvetia.
---
It's a seedy shed with wooden 4 wooden platforms in an L-shape around the shed, leading to a 1x1 metal shed with 3 vendors in it. On the L shaped platforms are weapon/armor/tinker and chem work benches, and just to the right of them are cooking/brew/fermenting stations, ammo machine and raider collectron for more ammo. Below the cliff is a river with 8 water purifiers and some crops planted. 
---
I'm not a huge fan of mansions either, mainly because the majority of the ones I see are HUGE... but completely barren inside. Probably a budget issue. Either way I'm not a fan either, but that's ok. Everyone plays the game their own way. If I don't like a camp, I just move on.
---
&gt;will ever be a way to switch doorways to different types of walls again?
---
Hi! I just posted about this [in our forums](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/422724/), but the short answer is yes! After investigating, being unable to replace Walls with Doorways was an unintended side effect of some of our other changes, and we're actively working on a fix. Should have more info about the status of the fix next week.

It’s a variant of the CPD Tactical Ranger Armor Outfit. That’s the Advanced variant.
---
Ik but I still see 50+ peeps picking on level 3 and stuff. I know it's not everyone but I still see a lot of player killer trolls in the game
---
It was an outfit from fallout 1st a while ago.

Cite one.

Trust me I know how much of a steel hog the .50cal is and don't get me started on the ammo hose that is the LMG. I tend to use a gatling and minigun for those reasons. I found that a good melee weapon and a 10mm SMG do wonders for ammo conservation in low level areas. I feel like I make ammo only once a month now. :P
---
That, right there.
---
I honestly feel like laughing... But at the same time  I know the game well enough, and not any of those details is even remotely funny. :/
---
That's unfortunately what I meant by replace the camp device. Glad it's sorted out though.
---
boodied players are just too dumb to figure out and combine the perks on their own, so they blindly copy/paste bloodied build from online
---
There was a hot fix yesterday. That was preventing people from returning to their worlds. They were fixing the Charleston mine bug that came with patch 21. I moved all my ammo from my mule today and dumped it into the ammo converter. It should be back to its old not so safe but kind safe ways again.
---
Take your medicine dammit!!!
---
Or you could not be a jerk and place it at the doorway.
---
I will kill you and definitely take what you got.
---
I would never use a melee weapon without faster swing speed. I can't even imagine what could on it worth doing without.
---
Yeah, I tried bloody melee (unarmed &amp; 2hand) but had a hard time and gave up before I figured it out.
---
Vamp ss knife I even used on sbq and other bosses, just used whiskey and fury to buff the dmg. Vaults was also a place where it came to good use. 🙂
---
Heavy guns still OP with the magic effects. I'll keep using shotguns because I don't really give that many fucks about builds. It kills. Good enough.
---
You cannot. Sorry.
---
They were running a hot fix yesterday. That prevented people from returning to their worlds. I did it today with no issues.
---
Wow that is incredible news! Thank you for the update.
---
I’m assuming neither did most players. Hell this patch was full of shit. 
---
**Fixed the “protects against waterborne diseases” on the CSA Helmet**
---
Wrong 
---
**Added Pocketed mod plans for Secret Service Armor**
---
Hmmm, nope
---
**Addressed an issue that would cause energy weapons like the Tesla or Flamer to not damage enemies**
---
.....HAHAHAHAHA!!!
---
**Simplified (the essential main quest) Ounce of Prevention**
---
It’s now broken and no one can complete it. 
---
**Delayed the release of Colossal Problem**
---
Don’t worry, they like dangling things in front of our faces that they know we can’t have on livestreams
---
**Addressed EXPLOITS in the CAMP building mechanics**
---
Oh wow! Thank you. I’m so glad you saved the playerbase from the awful exploit of having a nice camp (they’ll never tell us what “horrible” exploits this caused even though they’re proud of the fact they fixed it)
---
It's... probably the same box with the same loot table. I hope I'm wrong.

I like you better when im wasted.

Once you find her again it's a new vendor with new stock.
---
If you had a partner in crime you could take turn swapping while the other keeps her there and just keep buying.
---
Cool. Thanks. I missed info on the hot fix.
---
ignoring 45% of incoming melee damage is huge in this game..
---
Explain how it’s an English language error.
---
i was dpind guided meditation and saq one launch
---
It’s a solid hypothesis, but the practice would be fine if they had functioning QA onshore. The nature of some bugs make it clear they did very little testing, if any.
---
Gonna be funny when BoS comes out and their daily mission is supply them with 100 steel,10 cork etc each day
---
Well. I did it for the Baseball Bat plan. Finally got it. It was worth the 55k steel.
---
Seems to concisely explain the situation, probably true IMHO.
---
I agree completely. My camp is in the northwest corner. There’s a small “farm” with 3 NPCs that just chill and “repair” the buildings. I added a bunch more plants in the farm plot, a big tent with some kitchen stuff, a shed with some work benches, an ally and a Brahmin. It feels like a tiny settlement that fits into the world and I love it.
---
About 2 hours 40 minutes in they start fo76
---
More heavy atk dmg and % less dmg taken when heavy atk. Thats how I tanked sbq first 4-5 months lol
---
That's awesome. In my experience on Xbox people don't even wave back lol
---
Loved the montage at the end! So many satisfied customers
---
And yet, you’re the one that started the fight. And so is he. 
---
I know, you’re just upset that the other person didn’t roll over and whimper at your blustering. That’s what you’re used to. 
---
Feel free to just walk away, if it bothers you so much.
---
Well. Silver lining atleast our community manager is pretty *tidy*. I had to watch it again as I wasn't paying attention to the problem lol 
---
We could have got some rancid toad of a guy. So there's always that.
---
The text is red if safe/door/item is in a claimed workshop, or at least it used to be.
---
Following
---
I mean... if that was an intended nerf (which I hope it isn’t, because seriously) all they had to do was spread out the cripple amount on the card between the pellets. No need to drop the effect entirely.
---
Or if it had to go, give shotguns some armor penetration. Then they wouldn’t be borderline useless, at least.
---
150+ lvls I did with vamp ss knife and power armor. Bosses, raids and events aswell. (50% hp to max proc Adrenal Reaction)
---
Well that surely wasn't it because she was doing fuck all for damage and was getting killed left and right. I meant for her specifically.
---
No it shouldn't.  I'm a bloodied power armor user and I'm extremely difficult to kill. Power armor as bloodied has it's own advantages:
---
- High Dr and Er (my dr , er and rr is 700+, 700+, 500+)
---
- 42% damage reduction, 7% per piece  (not including emergency protocols)
---
- you cannot be staggered as long as you're in first person, weird that you can be in third for some reason 
---
- no fall damage 
---
- Stablized helps make heavy guns stronger
---
Plus they're introducing Power armor reboot,  which is basically auto heal when 0 hp. There are also poison resistance and fire resistance perks coming out for it too among others.
---
Are you on Xbox?
---
[deleted]
---
Bold of you to assume that the devs have played the game.
---
might be wrong about what? why are people so angry that i'm reporting my issues with the game. Starting to think youa re a troll
---
I had that happen too. I reset the game and was able to "rejoin team" and thankfully still got my loot. I didn't expect to though
---
I *literally* respecce’d into shotguns today.
---
That being said, I was crippling SB wings when Enforcer was equipped and forcing them to land pretty consistently.
---
LOLOL DAMN IT I love this game and it fucking hurts!!!
---
Yeah sry, thought you meant overall. Yeah I dont know why we had to see her screen...
---
Assume? You must not have read the above post fully.
---
Someone’s been living under a rock lmao
---
Where did I complain about you reporting your issues?  You need to read more carefully.
---
I know. It’s like being in an abusive relationship
---
Thank you for this!
---
Lol, no biggie.
---
It was a joke.
---
I would love Enforcer to lose the stagger, gain AA and a lower chance to cripple.
---
It's supposed to be, but I picked a lock at a workshop and was instantly wanted. I didn't even realize it was a workshop tbh, so I was really confused.
---
Sometimes peoples camps don't show as red, but I know not to pick them because it's in someone's camp
---
My friend killed a guy in a contested workshop and he left. He was level 35 and he had tons of loot like 110 steel and my friend wanted to text to have him get his stuff back but she said his settings won’t allow anyone to text him.
---
Best part was fps drop and ”be right back”-screen. That said everything about the state of the game.
---
Well for one, it's a sentence fragment. You have a verb and a vague indirect object, nothing more. Cite one what? Cite one example of you using English? Cite an error you made? Cite one of Shakespeare's works?
---
Aw, you made a friend!  Now the two of you can have warm fuzzie cuddles together. 
---
Lose the attitudes of superiority, boys. Show some humility and get over yourselves. 
---
Good night!  It’s been fun.
---
And it would carry literally any other game if devs supported it.
---
Especially since it updated daily and isn't live. I don't wanna donate when we could've already met the goal
---
My level is 120 and i keep getting stimpaks. I just go to wayward and drop some stimpaks to new player. Free up the space and be kind to other lol. 1 stimpak = 1lb
---
Tyty
---
Bloodied power armor is really useful for SBQ, you get stabilized for more damage with heavy guns and can sit in front of the queen at 20% health and still tank the hits which keeps her on the ground longer. For everything else stealth unyielding is just easier, farming is easier because the mobs don't roam so you can just follow a route which I prefer instead of checking for stuck mobs. More INT for XP too.
---
I got Twitch silenced for 10mins because of pointing that out. Also probably because I told them to get a proper programming team and a real internal test team, but we all know that'll never happen.
---
I would have stopped and been confused if it was red. I know better. In fact that was the first time I was wanted because I know the warning signals. I didn't realize it hides everyone on the map. I thought it kept loading me into a private server. I was sure I had broken the game....again.
---
Are civets native to West Virginia?
---
I'm kind of realizing this. Even since I got FO1st and can chill in my private world and not worry about the PVP aspect, many of the mineral resources require acid to turn into viable scrap, so now I also have to take Hemlock Holes, and the defense and retaking is annoying after a while. Especially when I can just raid gyms and enemy bases for weights and can chimes to get lead.  Steel is the easiest to come by scrapping weapons.  And so forth. Like you, I still go help with defense events when other people have the workshop.
---
I think you'd have to have the private world, take nearly every workshop, and dedicate your entire play session to collecting and defending to make it a worthwhile resource gathering method.
---
the thing is, you can fix new vegas, cant fix 76
---
Here is live updates data mined from the website, its more up to date than what the website displays at!
---
https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/daily.html
---
Its currently bugged by beths latest update. Unprogressable I've heard. Unprofessional too smh
---
It normally is, but sometimes work shops don't show on map sometimes and when they don't it doesn't warn you.
---
Oh sweet! Thanks!
---
I have full modded buttressed ss armor.plus full protective ss underarmor.i can take on anything.with a full modded gauss shotty hardened rec.extended barrel precise stock extended mag.reflex sight.with maxed perks.its borderline god mode.
---
I really just think they 100% cannot figure it out with the engine. Also Austin is a fairly new studio in BGS so, little experience with it probably doesn't help.

It’s been “getting nerfed in the next patch” for the last year and a half.
---
They are not down, no.
---
The only one I'm aware of is the one you are ballpark standing on
---
I know, I just wanted to point it out.
---
Sad if true. I relied on my shotty pretty heavily to put SBs in punching range.  May have to find myself a Quad rifle and hop to Tormentor instead.
---
Oh, So it might just be me?
---
Antiquated engine never meant for multi-player.
---
Np man, don't sweat him at all. Eventually he'll go off and have a "struggle session" by himself so he can feel better.
---
Thats what makes the game for me! Love this random shit that happens😂
---
SHHHHH! Don’t talk about it or they might find out and fix it!!!!
---
I have one next to my camp. 
---
head south from yellow sandy's still and you'll see the metal fence. This is site alpha silo i believe
---

---
I do relate!
---
I did, but luckily I realized it before exiting the machine so I was able to buy it back.
---
The level up needs to be replaced. Expecting characters to level up every day is obnoxious at high levels and I shouldn’t have to create a new character to satisfy a daily.
---
Can someone link the stream?
---
The INT bonus is what really got me thinking about this. I see Unyielding people talk about how they're long since done with the run thanks to a permanent ~36% EXP increase. I think PA needs a bone thrown to it to contend with that alone.
---
Easiest one is fast travel to Yellow Sandies Still, turn your dumb ass around and look for the fenced in area about 100 feet away.
---
Sorry but I laughed picturing your face expression at the moment you got pushed through the wall... 😂 My apologies 😅
---
It's still shit tbh
---
I wouldn't worry too much. IMO the progress meter on farming is like the weatherman saying that Santa's sleigh has been spotted on radar on Christmas eve. It's likely bullshit.  Even if we don't get to 200,000,000 they will likely say that we did. That's if they even keep track of it, which is questionable.
---
By “bad” you mean somewhat realistic and not a floating box in the sky.
---
Currently building a scrapyard styled camp in the ash heap and I’m VERY happy with the results thus far
---
It’s a complete sentence, not a sentence fragment. 
---
In the English language, a directive statement has the implied and accepted subject of ‘you’.  It is grammatically correct to omit the word ‘you’ when speaking to someone directly. 
---
*‘Bring me the box.’*  That is a complete sentence, and grammatically identical to ‘You, bring me the box’. 
---
Additionally, when a directive statement is in reply to another statement, there is no need for elaboration.  In context, the indirect object is clear, at least to anyone that has a basic grasp of English linguistics. 
---
*‘Which box do you want me to bring to you?’*
---
*’Bring me the red one.’*
---
If the person then replied ‘the red what?’, they would be viewed as a fool. In context, the indirect object is clear, and is not a grammatical error if omitted.
---
Thank you. That felt damn good to dissect your little amateurish superiority attempt, once again. Proving you wrong is getting to be an addictive habit. 
---
Run along now. Oh, wait, sorry. That’s going to confuse you with your limited grasp of linguistics. 
---
***You*** *run along now.*
---
Yeah I donated 1000 steel saw that they were only holiday gifts and left and didn’t go back.
---
What was it?
---
i don't care i love the game go cry somewhere else
---
Yes but that’s always been there
---
And it's Fallout 76. Honestly, do you really think anyone outside of this sub or the forum gives two shits about this trainwreck? Game shows need to move on to quality material. Not jokes.
---
I know. It's really obscure and no one mentioned it yet.
---
My newbie first experience with other players came around lvl 10 I had two lvl 5s come to my camp and start to fight me and after shooting back they tried to tear down my camp with explosives... I haven’t gotten gifts but it’s nice to hear.  I also just started a few weeks ago I should add.
---
This needs more upvotes, it's new, and it's just happened to me too.  
---
I ran a character through it a month ago and it was fine.
---
Today it's an issue, as described. Also to confirm sample is not in my inventory, had been collected and placed into the device.
---
Yes please! I want to keep my diner fully stocked and am getting a bit tired of my canned coffee runs.
---
I felt bad because a level 30 was causing havok and got a wanted level and I’m almost level 70. I stalked his house and waited for him to enter a crafting menu before I snuck up and just mauled him with my deathclaw gauntlet🤭
---
Part of what I didnt like about the rep grind, in games like WoW a higher rep opens up more quests. This makes the higher ranks go a bit quicker despite needing more rep to rank higher. Fo76 though it's just the same 2 dailies plus side.
---
Probably need to update your game.
---
You ma ma ma make me.....happeeh.
---
Yeah and what was laborious before is excruciatingly bad. Thanks to whichever assh@le thought to fix it. It’s like they saif “alright they’re bitching about too little points cap” we’ll give it to them and take this too!”
---
No I'm saying the converter is shit 
---
Games fine. Would rather break down ammo for components like Steel, lead and gunpowder
---
I fixed it.. thats what I meant to say, thanks
---
That’s why nukes take 3 minutes to drop, enough time to attempt fast travel 17 times.
---
How...?
---
No need. Proving you wrong was quite satisfying. But a little too easy, if I’m being honest. 
---
I’m going to reverse my position here. I apologize for my actions to both of you. They were completely unnecessary.
---
I shouldn’t take any pleasure in this. It’s like kicking a defenseless puppy.  
---
I am sorry, little puppies. I shouldn’t have kicked you so hard. My apologies.
---
Increased AP has no effect on defensive stats? What does Dodgy run on?
---
And Stealth IS a type of defense.
---
Actually I have two bloodied heavy gunner builds, and they are extremely powerful. BE 50cal, B3325 plasma caster for almost all content, but for SBQ mobs I bring out the VE gat plasma to keep health up. Very viable build as enemies rarely get a chance to shoot me.
---
This shit is always so cheesy
---
How do I get my free hat? I ain't donating shit but I want my free stuff. 
---
So I can never wear it because I'm no BOS slave.
---
Idiots.
---
That's not true.  Price equals demand devided by supply.
---
I think it was a Junkies minigun or gatling laser. At the time, I was not using heavy weapons so I never bothered to change the name on it like I do with weapons I do use (I normally put a 'z' in front of the name so that I can tell not to SCRIP it and also that makes it appear lower in the inventory). I am glad I did not SCRIP it because I am thinking about changing from shotgun to heavy with my alt.
---
Maybe an outcast paint job for power armor would be cool
---
why you'd get one lead and steal from like 20 bullets
---
Patriarchy?
---
They are in the floor decor page.
---
I also had just received the last Halloween / Christmas decorations and then read in the wiki along the lines of "before patch 21 you were able to receive previous limited time rewards, this has been fixed now"
---
Not one evidentiary statement you've posted clarifies your indirect object. It's vague and therefore improper. The prosecution rests its case, Beavis.
---
what turrets?
---
Fine with that especially the .38 .44 and shotgun shell 
---
Ammo I don't use.
---
I heard that there is some glitch associated  with "instigating"?
---
The new perks are still pretty meh for PA users when Legendary Armors exist. Especially with the new Legendary Specials which lets you have an additional 5 perk points for skills at max level.
---
I'd love to visit both bases. Mine's just up the hill from the Mountainside B&amp;B; I turned it into a small rest stop with a diner for weary travellers.
---
I think around 18 or so miniguns I got a bloodied magic one.  Never looked back.
---
I have:   
---
Accidentally sold ton of super valuable weapons without realizing   
---
- Multiple bloodied weapons as I didn't realize how powerful that build can be   
---
- Some legacy weapons as I never realized those could be removed...   
---
- Urban scout mask for 100caps as I thought it was common item you can buy whenever on enclave bunker. Realized my mistake when I saw someone selling it for 24k caps on trade forum.   
---
- Green asylum dress for 100caps, tho I now have brown and pink ones so not that bad 
---
Accidentally pressed drop on weapon with atomic shop paint and immediately clicked accept meaning it gets permanently destroyed instead of drop   
---
- My dear dear furious explosive .50cal which was able to eat everything in seconds. To describe it's power I named it "Pure rage"
---
Accidentally scripted valuable weapons   
---
- 2 shot fatman   
---
- bloodied pipe rifle, it was my favorite weapon due fallout feelings   
---
- That whatever super slegde you get from Vatoga mayor mission...
---
Sold weapons that i didn't know were valuable   
---
- Explosive flamer, I never used flamers so wasn't special at that time...   
---
- bloodied hunting rifle for 500caps. Didn't find bloodied built any good until now but thankfully I bought new one from vendor at price of 10k caps   
---
Accidentally broken into junk because Bethesda hates us   
---
- Pearly peepers. fuck me.   
---
- Forest camo jumpsuit. No one told me those fuckers are rare...
---
And how I feel about those... Well I have permanently quit the game. That's how I feel. At least in Fallout 4 I have console and option to SAVE and LOAD...
---
The game is updated, still have no idea what’s wrong with it.
---
I say this all the time but it's true. If you're using a PC or a PS4 you should defragment your drive after any significant upgrade. on PS4 you do this by doing a rebuild database from the maintenance menu, which you access by turning off the PS4 and then holding the power button down for about 10 seconds to turn it back on. They'll be a beep a pause and then a second beep...
---
Why?
---
I think it has to do with texture and/or resource loading and game timeouts. The program goes looking for something very specific on the disk, doesn't load it in time, declares your session out of synk and disconnects you.
---
In Windows there's a bug involving memory mapped files where the mapping can return success even though the data has not actually been moved into position yet. Combined with certain threading operations bad data can end up in funny places.
---
On the PS4 there's a whole bunch of metadata stored in the database, where "database" means file system structure, and refers to the custom file system used on the PS4.
---
I presume the Xbox has the same problem as Windows, but I don't know how to defrag an Xbox.
---
Doing the check disc and defrag operations improves the data flow by making sure that read ahead doesn't waste any time reading uninteresting data.
---
I realize this sounds stupid when you hear of the first time, but it really does make a huge difference. No I don't know the exact reasons cuz I don't have access to the exact code bases.
---
Just give it a shot and tell me how wrong I was... 🤘😎
---
And that tic...tic...tic...tic... That is torturing! I even get myself sometimes slowly closing my eyes while thinking positive that one more "tic" and here I go.
---
Whenever I see a floating base, I instantly want to nuke it into oblivion, especially if the vending machines are filled with mounted cat head plans.
---
You're still here? Damn, son. Quit while you're behind, because with that limited intellect you aren't going to catch up.
---
your what now
---
You stop by my camp near sutton recently?
---
And packing light should give less weight reduction to pistols and give armor penetration. That card has no excuse for not giving some - pistols are extremely light as is.
---
It’s much much much much better than what it was at launch. It was unplayable at launch. Now it’s fun.
---
Yeah just lost 2 legendaries from a disconection from the server
---
Power armor reboot is better than you think . It is a 40 % chance to regenerate health when 0 hp, no downed motion or anything. A bit like that speed demon / life giver bug but better, although the other power armor perks are meh but one of them gives you a healing effect for energy damage taken (20%). Specials are great too.
---
if it was unplayable how did i play it?
---
Yes? And no? Its enjoyable despite its disconnecting and lag for me. Plus after bringing back NPCs it isn't so boring
---
My camp is a nuclear waste disposal site for the  Blue Ridge Caravan's *Manhattan II* project.
---
If it were intended, I assume they'd have changed the description on the Enforcer card itself, right? If the change was intended but they chose NOT to update the perk info for all to see, that's pretty shitty.
---
I'm hoping it's unintended. Not because I personally care whether or not I cripple or not with a shotgun (though it would really hinder my build), but because I want Bethesda to be transparent with their changes. I can accept when bugs or breaks happen, but not undocumented changes to the fundamental uses of a whole set of weapons.
---
I've sort of had the same thought as an equal to you except I'm furloughed. The way I've seen it though is the legendary board game will come and go. Once it's over I'll be back to my normal nights of playing and messing around. I may not use any of the stuff but I want it. I did finish the board game already and definitely have this odd sense of emptiness. I've taken time off from the game now just coming on to do scrip/gold/caps.
---
It was a bit of a grind but it's not supposed to be easy. I feel like the challenges (if they werent broke) is enough to get it done just on time. But they do want you there every day to do them.
---
Such is the state of gaming online today.
---
I have had this problem for the last week. I did a total reinstall overnight and am still having the same issue. Currently testing another character to find if it is a character based bug.
---
Edit - both my characters get dc'ed. 😣
---
dammit I just rolled a quad gauss shotgun, anyway thanks, good to know
---
Oh no, I destroyed pearly peepers also because I not realize that it was valuable.... How much is it worth?
---
Little Puppy, your inability to understand simple grammar rules in English doesn’t invalidate anything I said. 
---
Go cite a resource that supports your claim. The burden of proof is on you, Prosecutor Puppy.
---
Not a dev room item, but close. A few months ago, there was an interesting glitch involving scrappable preexisting containers at workshops. You put weapons in them(or sometimes power armor pieces), scrapped the container, and when you checked your stash box the items would be modified variants of Nuclear Winter weapons. The power armor would have NW paint jobs. If you stuck a paddle ball in the container, the modified paddle balls came out.
---
You typing words, deluding yourself that they're being read by anyone. They aren't.
---
&gt;do our own thing  
---
   
---
Yeah! Like spending half the day farming mats for ammo!
---
Just because the servers are lagging doesn’t mean there’s a new duping method
---
I was looking at a safe in a workshop. It was locked, the fucking upstairs office room at the munitions factory while it was owned by another player.   
---
It was red when I first looked at it, which struck me as odd, so when I relooked at it, it had swapped back to its normal UI color.   
---
After picking the look I became wanted 10 caps.  I was so annoyed I looted the safe, and left the dude ( he was level like 50 something ) a veritable mountain of assault rifles I had planned to use to chunk away at my daily cap limit.   
---
Had to wait for ever to get clapped at AWOL armaments, Big ups to chinese stealth suit lad. Waved at him, he waved at me and I could finally go do my part to advance the player economy.
---
Yes, but karma is on you side.  Their greed is their problem.  :-)
---
I do the same as you and sell everything dirt cheap,too.
---
The Little Puppy continues to bark. His little tiny teeth are so adorable. 
---
Pinocchio Prosecutor Puppy, would you like some prosciutto?
---
Shotguns shells are precious to magic shotgun users.
---
So are they mounted on a foundation?
---
Can you add the non-stair version on either side?
---
I’ve had this before and fixed it eventually and I swear it had to do with that. I can understand if you don’t want to risk a further mess though.
---
It was shit, and now it is different colored shit.
---
I tried using another character. Still not working.
---
You get the outcast pa set for getting to rank 60 in nw btw
---
Resources.
---
distant thunder. Takes like 30 seconds if that. Chance of rare PA plans.
---
Or at least thats what shes paid to say! LOL.
---
It will be with the brahmin pen in the building menu
---
Shotguns suck cause of rubber banding damage
---
Feed the People.
---
Is the first one in resources for me
---
Restores fusion cores. Not HP unfortunately.
---
*You’re* reading them. And that’s good enough for me.  Because it irks you enough that you’re compelled to continue the dance. 
---
Waltz in the moonlight for me, Pinocchio Prosecutor Prosciutto Puppy.
---
Wouldn't know I don't play the battle royal 
---
Don't trust my WiFi connection
---
This was tested and documented in the pts. It does both
---
No, no it is not. There are multiple potential direct objects that you attempt to refer to with one indirect object. By trying to ignore, or being too stupid to notice, my assertion that your error in using the English language is the fact that you keep using the English language, you left your statement vague. Without clarifying the direct object, your statement becomes a fragment. We're done here, son.
---
Oh i forgot about that! Thank God! It was driving me nuts! Way to go Bethesda!
---
So this game is *still* a Bloodied BIS build, while they continue to nerf everything else into worthlessness?
---
Just a meme
---
Yeah, without private servers for farming fusion cores, I'd never bother with power armor.
---
The other day, some wanted guy who was level 43 came over to the wayward where me, on a level 5 alt, and a new player at level 9, were. He said Ha, look at you noobs and opened fire and killed me, I quickly said to my teammate to store his junk items and I disconnected from server. A couple seconds later I loaded back in on my 250 character, and blatantly said, listen. I run an explosive shotgun that per pellet does 300 damage to the SBQ, still wanna fight? He just shot and I one tapped his sorry ass. But wait, he comes back and goes off about how I actually spent time getting gear and was like in NW it would be a fair fight. When I’m reality we probably wouldn’t get to 1v1. But the sad thing is, this guy, who keep in mind was 9x my level, I almost killed on my level 5 character
---
I don't understand,  can you get any cursed weapon like a cursed bloodied ffr lmg or are there just specific weapons?
---
It's like they're doing it on purpose.... Time to make some baits.
---
Incorrect!  Because your statement was that I had made errors. The reply of ‘cite one’ is unambiguous. 
---
You lost track of the order of occurrences, little puppy.
---
Same here.
---
I know right. What so bad about just having only the ammo options you have in your inventory. You pick that ammo and it scraps all of it into ammo points after a confirmation (so you don’t scrap your 25k 5.56 on accident). No one donates just a part of an ammo they don’t need. Heck, I don’t even care if it rounds the ammo points down and eats 5-20 ammo. Whatever makes it a painless endeavor to convert. Bethesda has forgotten that ammo for the most part is worthless, so any painful ordeal to extract value will just have us back to dumping ammo in suitcases.
---
The triple turret threat from the Church near Harpers, those sneaky bundle in the Burrow, literally any blood eagle camp in the Bog.
---
Wherever they might be hiding, these turrets are the only thing that messes my lvl 150 up (that quickly), mainly due to the exploding bullets that stagger and aimbot that smashes you in the face harder than Mandingo~
---
Im not sure what you mean by that
---
Edit: my bad, i see that it was ment for the OP and not me.
---
Are any of you on xbox? On the hunt for a cheap brick set, hitech lights and more.
---
They did the same to me for rule 10.  I totally agree with you.  There are new players all the time that may not know things.
---
Negative, Ghostrider. Bold assertions are not automatically correct ones, sorry.
---
Or maybe a reduction to critical hit cost too, that stacks with other effects? Pistols should really be the critical hit build.
---
Find a friend and have them kill you and watch your junk while you respawn. Then you keep your junk and you’re not wanted.
---
The truth is neither bold nor timid. It simply is. 
---
You got mixed up, little puppy.  
---
Now, it’s time for a nice cigar and aged whiskey.  You are dismissed.
---
It’s been fun. But not challenging at all. 
---
Pity.
---
all these patch notes are good and all but im confused on a few things. Grahm attacks my base and any workshops i possess, and some of my quest lines are still broken. are these things still normal...?
---
What’s a rule 10?
---
&gt;time to scourge for old posts
---
There's literally a search bar at the top of the reddit to instantly find what you're looking for. 
---
Like them or not, the rules are there for a reason. Everyone gets tired of seeing the same posts day in and day out.
---
Just today killed a three star glowing mirelurk hunter and watched him fall through the map.
---
lol, I'm gonna miss you.
---
Yeah but it might have an amazing rebirth since the titan fall devs have been given control for making the 2.0 update for it.
---
Shotgun, as long as you pick any shotgun that isn't a double barrel, combat, tesla, plasma, laser or gauss~ 
---
TS Harpoon Flechettes get an honourable mention for being hilarious, that, bundled with the fact you never need to make ammo if you have one shot chambered~
---
Omg you got a three star? I just got a two star junkies rolling pin from the queen and I thought I won the lottery already.
---
I am glad to hear you have had a good experience. 
---
It was/is the same for me. I have been playing for about three weeks now, but had multiple people just randomly help me out. It has been an awesome experience, and I have absolutely done everything I can to help out new players. Normally I drop 10-20 purified water on them as soon as I catch up to them out of the vault. I also try to sell all of my ammo very cheaply. 
---
I also recommend joining public teams. The benefits really help (even if you are not a good level to join people on their own quests). And, you can fast travel to team mates and their bases allowing you to explore and shop at other vendors without spending caps. I only recently learned about this and am kicking myself for not joining them earlier.
---
Good luck on your quest to reclaim Appalachia!
---
Radiation Rumble. So I don’t get to play it often.... Rarely pops up anymore
---
Thanks for the advice
---
Trading posts or retired Bethesda please add posts.
---
here i thought it was just my net acting up
---
Ok, thanks
---
Why I hate that one
---
My psn is Tomste21
---
The community is great.  Someone did it for me too when I was low level and I return the love now that I’m high level!  Keep paying it forward!
---
I am not gonna put a damn gas sipping hippy mobile in my front yard. They promised me a fully loaded for Corvega and that’s why I am gonna get.
---
It’s literally on the sub’s sidebar. It’s not pages  that you have to read. It’s the same with most subs.
---
That is literally what a customer service job is. And that is exactly what community manager is. They are directly responsible for handling the communities concerns, questions, and interactions with the company.
---
What does one do with all that fertilizer?
---
I always stop for hoard events, because they are quick, easy, and always have a 3 star legendary.
---
They are not mounted on a foundation. They just stand on the ground. I put one with stairs, then I wanted to add non-stair version. But because of the lag, same one with a  stair was installed.   
---
I can actually add the non-stair version on both sides. I already did this and it didn't help.   
---
I remember that a year ago I ran into the same bug, but I managed to somehow remove it. Now, I don't think I can.
---
Not if you know what you're doing. Imagine shaming someone for leaving 76 lol
---
I just need to change doors to walls and back because that's my secret door, OK?
---
Now everybody knows my lame secret door trick but whatever it keeps the scorched out
---
All hail to the robots
---
It happens to me half the time, I just take it slower and readjust.
---
Tru I did the mirelurk event 
---
Was surprised to find two legendary enemies to finish the daily score
---
Sounds like that guy you fucked up for picking on new players is a huge virgin
---
***Spooky Magic!***
---
Xp juice
---
That's pretty cool
---
Same here got a Bloodied SS +S and another one finishing the Encrypted then disconnected:( lost both legendary.
---
This ^^^ they should also take their job serious because we as paying customers do. And we decide if they have a job next year or the one after. Without our money this project is pointless because no matter how you feel Zenimax/Bethesda only made Fo76 to make money period end of story.
---
It feels like a 1990's game in that it's terrible, but fun, a cult classic.
---
No trading or retired posts. 
---
Basically, if something just gets posted exhaustively and it's something that can't really by fixed by players, the subject is retired. 
---
For example, the OPs post of wanting card loadouts has been discussed by this community since the launch of the game. Bethesda has acknowledged that it's something it's aware that the community wants. So the subject has been retired so the sub isn't overwhelmed by perk loadout requests and discussions. Same thing with the the main commenters post on the stash limit. 
---
The search bar is for looking up solutions to problems you may have, and then posting after if you can't find anything relevant to your situation. It's especially important for newer players because most of the questions they have have already been answered multiple times.
---
I paid 5k for one the other a guy scammed me and gave me it to kinda make up for it
---
This is an example of a cursed weapon from a previous post in the sub. It looks like it's stacked with abmain prefix. In this case executioner. They probably break really quick then.
---
http://imgur.com/I0IML3S
---
Yeah, but sometimes you get a lot of ammo for guns you don't use. Unless you're a jack of all trades with your guns, which would be a good way to save ammo and condition for some guns.
---
if no one abused it to break the server there was no reason for fix that but there you go, your precious community
---
It's one big vault tech experiment
---
The SBQ is the only one I drop everything for, even though the rewards could be better.
---
It hurt the soul to play. 
---
But nah, I got it at launch and couldn’t walk 20 steps without supermutants spawning on my head. I know you know what I’m talking about.
---
If you run through a silo, the exit is right next to the launch doors.
---
Fly Swatter is a good one if you need to do events. It takes 25 seconds to down the certified and BAM! 
---
Event complete
---
I would like to know as well I've had them in my stash for a month or two and can't even remember where I found them.
---
anyone know how the beret will be claimed?
---
Luckeeeee, I just got the 500
---
so basically your friend is an asshole and made the underleveled guy ragequit
---
the only cool thing is the bos collectron and that challenge would benear the end of the month xd
---
Tried adding a plain one, then another stair on the side of that?  Just spitballing but I’ve done the same thing before
---
for me, it’s probably “lode bearing“ and “breach and clear”
---
You spend to win, or won it naturally?
---
I felt the same and also waited quite awhile, but you got this! Also helps to bring a buddy! And remember you’ll need enough ammo and chems depending on your build for the silo and the Queen after. Also doesnt hurt to read up on what to expect! I also check for who is on the server - higher level players more likely to help you out with the SBQ. Go get em!!
---
Tried and was the only player doing it 
---
Didn't last long lol
---
76 it's player base is everything but toxic. Most people are helpful, but that's the positive side. The downside is all the duping, griefers bragging with their legacies, bugs and so on. I think it's the best one yet.
---
Try it out for yourself since it’s free, people on this subreddit are quick to bash this game over some faults that can happen with any game really. I personally like the game, some things are kinda bad but at the same time there is some good too.
---
Hell no. Ep is amazing if you also had serendipity it would be God mode.
---
Bloodied in pa is 100% viable already.
---
My favorite moment was when the stream crashed lmao
---
I missed the broadcast and went back to watch it and I think she handled it like a pro. It's hilarious and not a good look, but she barely blinked even though she was about to die from rads.  Though... I kind of wonder if what she did sheds some light on the nature of the bug.  The third attempt was successful after she waited a few extra seconds and stepped forward some.
---
Any player above about 300 will be able to answer any or at least most of all your questions. Shoot them a message, 90% of all 76ers playing will have no issue answering if an item is rare or not.
---
The event will autocomplete either way, games never let community events fail.
---
I think pipe weapons give cork when scrapped so the penitentiary and grafton/ grafton steel mutants usually have lots of auto pipe rifles
---
There is a mountain of fun to climb but the frustration can be like falling from the peak head over heels. So yeah give it a whirl.
---
A shovel, pickaxes,  harpoon these are the only cursed weapons :(
---
They also showcased the fast travel glitch in all its glory. One of the devs tried to fast travel and ended up miles away from their goal.
---
I think it goes to show just how out of touch they are. They don't even understand what state the game is in or they would never dare to live stream it.
---
Hell yea breach and clear is my bread and butter 
---
I tend to get as much lead and iron ore to build ammo for my main .50 cal machine gun. All I need now is more acid for smelting and gunpowder
---
Yep same here ps4. Was getting it a week before updates tho.
---
Double xp was the real changer for me. I had off the whole weekend and grinded from lvl 53 to lvl 87. I did buy a couple of levels at the end, like 94-96
---
Wow, you slided into my Dms telling me to go fuck myself, such maturity, such grace. im honestly still confused what you guys are upset about.
---
 Remove them by the order you placed it. Or add a 3rd foundation and try an remove the one you couldn't.
---
I really dont. I put like 350 hours into this in the first month or something. Couldn't get enough.
---
Thanks for the very helpful details.
---
Going from one Bethesda game to another doesn't help his case
---
yea, same here happen at 2:10 am right after i had sent a report asking what was going on xD just glad it didn't take forever
---
Why doesn't AWOL get any love?
---
How dare you. New vegas is a god damned national treasure and if you didn't enjoy it, its your fault.
---
100%.
---
I always leave a couple of stimpaks, RadAways, Nuka Colas, and a bit of pre-war food in their loot bag after.
---
Unless they got wanted picking the single lock at my camp. At that point I will hunt them down across the map, beat the brakes off them and then leave them only one stimpak. Clean yourself up, kid.
---
New Vegas isn't a "Bethesda" game. And mods have fixed the issues with the engine.
---
The best part about your statement is that you have no way to prove it so it’s hard to be challenged, but the only method of disproving it would be screwing over the rest of the community and then everyone would be too distracted to call you out for being wrong. 
---
It’s an interesting position to take, I’ll give you that.
---
I wonder what that first BoS soldider will say, when he gets to the Atlas and sees about 100 million baseballs.
---
It is my sworn duty to rid the wasteland of any wanted player that I see.  You'll know it's me on your trail when you hear the [Whistle of the Cactus Man](https://youtu.be/OaKH9bywzgQ) over my mic. Justice will be done.
---
I guess I could stop looting people's stuff though...
---
Love messenger quest always have
---
Love that one!  Usually at least two good high level legendaries and there’s not 5-8 people all trying to tag.
---
Or the other respawn bug where there isn't any buttons you can press and the camera just pans around your corpse. Or the respawn bug where you don't get any map markers to respawn at, not even Vault 76,or the respawn bug where your only respawn point costs 60 caps at the opposite end of the map, double that if you want your junk back!
---
Maybe in an enclave themed roadmap.
---
Anti armor on all energy weapons only affects the BASE weapon damage. Which means, as you stack up damage effects (weapon perks, general damage perks, legendary effects like junkies/bloodied, Adrenal Reaction) it gets less and less useful.
---
so, it’s pretty bad for energy weapons. It’s better than it was at launch when it didn’t affect energy weapons at ALL, but yeah, their “fix”... didn’t fix it
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
Worked for me. Thanks.
---
Heh, there's  a fallout 4 mod that does this. In fact it brings cartoons to the wasteland and you can watch bugs bunny and stuff. Totally superfluous mod but damn if I don't love it!
---
Not magic shotguns. They kill with 1 shot. I got 2 magic combat shotguns with +33% vats. Going to Wes tek, the super mutants die faster than their voice and can register. A lv 65 scorchbeast takes 2 shots to the head to down once they land and I have no shotgun perks. My bloodied does like 320 damage a shot and sneaking isn't needed. As long as the vats percentage is 95%, it's a 1 shot kill for a majority of everything in the game.
---
I doot-doot doot-doot dooty-doot doo
---
The majority of the playerbase doesn't care about voicing their opinion or any comment at all in any platform be it Reddit, Fb, discord, twitter, whatever
---
Wait, your problem with this game at launch was you couldn't beat super mutants?
---
The corkpololispe is soon apon us ,
---
Very good for farming tho
---
Man. You didnt even have to wear any protection!
---
I didn’t think he understood that my friend was trying to get a workshop to do the dailies and plus we tried messaging him to get his stuff back to him
---
Oh and we were trying to get his stuff back and do the right thing but his message settings were closed
---
Is your partner really getting upset with you over the amount of time you spend on this game?
---
Project paradise, radiation rumble, and scorched earth. I wish more people would do rad rumble/project paradise though...
---
I need to try some NUUKASHIIINE
---
Can someone compile a list of these things. Like the order of equipping perk cards. Like I noticed if I use cranberry cobbler before canned meat stew it cancels the other out. But if you use canned meat stew first then cranberry cobbler. It stacks. I need a print out help sheet please. I know for junkies there is an order to chem use. I remember seeing somewhere else.
---
Wholly fuck! Detailed. No armor stats though.
---
Oh no. Melee builds will not be happy.
---
I do it for fomo now, I used to go in with a tesla to “share” tags, but now so many ppl just one-shot stuff I need to get in first usually. Although tbf, I only do that IF I see someone else doing it, I still tesla until needed
---
130 hours and all dlc but honest hearts beat and I still don't change my mind. Sorry bout that. It was pretty fun don't get me wrong, but 4 spoiled me so much with actual good weapon customization and a BoS that weren't a bunch of quivering babies in a bunker
---
The lead deposit inbetween west tek and huntersville
---
I just spent hundreds of rounds on a queen for a goddamn 1 star rolling pin.
---
Just starting?
---
I’d suggest sticking too the forest area for the first 10’ish lvl’s,learn the mechanics of the game a bit,do leader of the pack If you can make it there when it Pops,get cha a decent weapon &amp; start trying to craft cherself some leather armor.
---
That’s If a high lvl doesn’t show up,&amp; get cha going wit a starter pack,which has been known to happen on occasion.
---
I think it goes Forest,northern area that name escapes me,then down too the ash heap,back up to the savage divide,then down towards the cranberry bog.
---
That’s how I start most play through anyhow.
---
Edit:toxic valley was the name that escaped me,Lol
---
They should just have zenimax make an fallout mmorpg for next generations.. and let player transfer over atoms’s item etc etc
---
Still pretty bad
---
Right now you should just be moving your camp along with you as you do the quests. Just setup somewhere that's convenient to the quests your doing, and don't bother with anything fancy just yet. You just need a box with your crafting benches, a bed, some water and maybe some crops. Later on you'll want to setup a more permanent camp, and you'll end up picking a spot that suits your play style the best.
---
You can select creature and then select perks/legendary prefixes that ignore armor and see how that affects damage done. Play around with it.
---
You might be the worst troll account in the history of troll accounts LMFAO.
---
That's part of the issue because it's not supposed to be. Only casual underarmors are supposed to be from the atom shop. The SS underarmor is supposed to be a skin and not an actual underarmor, but they accidentally made it one and now it can't be used.
---
One of the new gauss weapons more than likely
---
I want the .45 pistol back
---
It's an arms race.  If I don't have one, someone else still will and will deny me my legendaries.  I would rather deny other's their legendaries than be denied mine.  Sorry folks, but everyone has to stand down or no one will.
---
Gauss Shotgun?
---
Which one?
---
Gauss shotguns?
---
Explosives
---
This!  I swooped in, gave a heart, then killed the Wanted person, only to have them respawn while I stood guard over their bag, and they gave me a thumbs down and then left the map.  I was so disappointed!
---
No they spawned as I was exploring, in the sky, right on top of me. It was hella broken.
---
Other than this, I think they improved it, but this is such a huge problem it feels like they made it worse overall, unless you just wanna sell one huge stack.
---
Have you relogged since the issue started?  Sometimes it’s a ghost item.
---
I would suggest NOT the area around the Overseers CAMP and the Wayward. You will struggle to ever get your CAMP to place. Theres a lot of nice areas around the forest though. Enemies are low level and there is abundance of supplies to forage for. Im past level 200 now and I still call the forest home. Ive only recently moved from the aforementioned Overseers/Wayward area to south of Morgantown due to inability to place CAMP.
---
Wait those 2 stack? I thought you could only have 1 XP increasing food type active at once? Also you don't have to get addicted to anything in a certain order, as far as I know
---
Shit people can steal the stuff in your base? I want to play again but I’m terrible and can’t get anything done. Is it worth investing in the fallout 1 private server?
---
I couldn’t go anywhere without things spawning on my head or me glitching through the map. I quit after like 20 hours. I couldn’t bear it
---
I still drop by vault 76 now and then and just dump all my stimpaks it’s good to see others pay it forward and keep that positive vibe going for new players :-)
---
Light wood laminate? Can’t hear you over the sound of my canvas bag
---
Oo my favorite respawn one is where I legit got killed after killing some legndaries, and I attempted to hit soace to respawn. And the camera just circled my body forever.ike a good 30 minutes it sat thsre doing nothing any time i hit the space bar or whatever to respawn nothing just circles. I was passed. 
---
Or the ash pile loot dropping so far below the ground (between watoga  and fort defiance I fought noxious 1 star legendary and the loot pile dropped through the ground and I couldn't loot. Was mad.
---
My female ally wears either goofy costumes or badass combat uniforms.  I do like making male allies wear scout uniforms.
---
You’d still have all the AP.
---
I like helping low level players, I don’t care if they’re new or it’s an alt character. I almost always have an excess of healing, food and water so why not after all? Sometimes I’ll even craft full armor, a weapon and plenty of ammo just because. Heck I’ve given low level players a ton of plans before too, anything to help them if I can do it
---
Happened to me twice today. Luckily I did not steal. 
---
https://i.imgur.com/uQ1mKgV.jpg
---
Out of curiosity, what is it in the ATLAS box that you are grinding for?  
---
I don't understand the caps argument, because unless you get lucky and hit a 500cap reward, then most of the time you earn more caps just selling bulk steel to vendors.
---
Are there armor plans you still need or something?
---
Yep, didn't help, unfortunately.
---
It's a 1 minute solo fight for most "veterans". With no exploits, magic weapons etc.
---
Yeah,  been there.  You're not alone
---
Probably a gauss minigun, pistol, or shotgun. I'm pretty sure all gauss weapons automagically have the explosive effect. You only get them after completing wastelanders, AND grinding reputation, AND spending scrip on legendary modules, AND having enough materials to make it, AND hopefully getting one that isn't a garbage roll and is good enough to waste ammo to even use. But luckily they have added them to the random drop in certain events that drop a weapon at the end provided of course you did most the above mentioned steps to have learned the plan.
---
Its Americans,, they don't want to talk about Finland's guns, probably  you did in a few months what took them decades to achieve, beating Russia.
---
Do you wanna try it on a private server?
---
Don’t worry about your camp location until at least level 50. And even then you don’t need to worry about really. It’s just a camp. Go out explore and kill some legendary enemies when you hit 50. Camp builders are ruining this game honestly. All they care about are building camps and constantly begging for more camp cosmetics.
---
No. 
---
I could care less about 75% of the communal rewards and there is absolutely no reason for me to donate as there are no unique rewards I  can get. The event will finish whether or not I contribute. my ~40k cork is better off in my stash, even if ive only used like 40 cork in the past 4  months.
---
Not trying to be a wet blanket and ruin it for anyone, if youre excited about the event thats fine, but theres just no reason I can see to give up materials you use for literally nothing
---
Mostly the armor plans yeah.
---
I don't give a shit about what it looks like. It's only going to have the shit i need i just need to know where I should put it lol
---
Thats what quack surgeon is for! Just don't use Nukashine, unless, you know... ;-)
---
Follow up  
---
How can I tell what I gained ?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I did Level 1 to Level 54 or so by the time they patched it last week. If I got them, where do I find the Xmas/Halloween rewards ?
---
Thx
---
Jean
---
Does it worry anyone else when one of the devs says "we're pushing the boundaries of..."?c
---
Try it again , mines fixed after patch
---
No
---
Did you join them tho?
---
“listen we had our 7th water cooled bonesaw stolen that also has a piece of high grade military tracking device on if, if you could get it back yeah that’d be nice”
---
We need the most powerful ranged weapons and builds because else we would have to spend more time doing the boring chores of collecting resources to replenish bullets. Was hoping the ammo converter would change that but no they didn't change shit. The exchange price is way out of. They said they change events so every one participating would be able to lot the Legendary just like every one on a team can.
---
I did the same, and got to level 50 or so, How do I know if I got those ?
---
Right up to Fur Lined for Xmas
---
1- Where are they if I have them ?
---
PS the Halloween ones, how can I tell, what were they ? Thx
---
I don't have Finnish citizenship or live in Finland.  I think I'm 1/8th Finnish by blood though.  But I am American.  I only said this because I think having more historical impactful guns in the game would be cool.  The Thompson has a history of gangsters, while the Suomi has a history of the tenacity and sisu of the Finnish.  I'm into military history and I just think it'd be cool to see more of it outside of strictly historical video games like Battlefield or whatever.
---
Same for me.  And I'll happily through all my glass stash towards unlocking that bot.
---
What level are you? Personally I feel that the shotguns are really lackluster in this game. They also break diabolically fast especially if you get and explosive one, so they aren’t too reliable. Pistols are so underpowered in the game as well so I wouldn’t recommend using those either. The semi auto rifles are alright, lever actions are the best of the bunch, but if you’re really looking for the best build do heavy guns or automatic rifles. Gatling guns are a viable choice if you’re a relatively low level, I ran with one from about level 30 to level 50 and it kicked ass. But once you level up a bit the 50 cal mg is insane. Gauss minigun also pretty much shreds anything as well so pick that up once you get some gold bullion. For automatic rifles the 10mm sub is pretty good once you get some mods for it, so that’s good for low level players. But again once you level up a bit your choices grow a lot so I would recommend the .308 LMG. I have a two shot with 33% increased VATS accuracy and 15% faster critical hit meter which will melt almost anything. Hope that helps.
---
Aight thx
---
Good on you for doing it without pay to win.
---
Explosive yes, flame, idk.  I use a gauss minigun, which has a built in explosive effect, which grenadier increases.  If you want to test it, stand close to a wall and shoot.  You should be taking damage, with grenadier you should take damage from further away.
---
Vouched for. Great early camp, central to a lot of locations you’ll need.
---
Just to help sort them so you dont have 5000 things to look through when going through the list
---
Gauss is having problems causing damage. You may hit for 4000 (visible numbers) and only reduced a scorched's health by half an inch. I joined Line in the Sand today, I needed four or five shots from my INSTIGATING + LIMB DAMAGE + ALL RIFLEMAN PERKS to kill one of them, switched to my handmade and damage was inferior (numbers around 500) but they were killed with a single bullet. 
---
Something got broken during last patch.
---
Getting 250 steel takes no time at all really....
---
Try it i noticed this a few weeks ago. One way it shows only one xp boost. The other way it shows xp boost and I think it says second xp boost. I keep trying different ways to use them to see if it does something. I'm no expert. As for junkies I remember some video talking about if you use chems in a certain order.  It optimizes the benefits. Wish I could remember which video it was. I don't play junkies so I didn't bookmark it.
---
Ps4?
---
The one from the nv dlc
---
Dont mind me, I am just looking for Cranberries I swear!
---
Yeah
---
Bloodied western revolver + silenced bloodied 10mm is effective for 99% of what you can do in the game, even Scorched Earth. You need the right perks and build.
---
My gunslinger is a blast.
---
Thank you. It wasn't there, and needed to "refresh" or whatever.   
---
I did check there though, so I know I'm not actually crazy.
---
Do you know the actual name of the gun, I'm not too familiar with nv.
---
It finally showed up, thanks.
---
Um...no. Value is subjective. I may pay 1000 for something you think is only worth 5.
---
Sorry I can't help you.
---
What do you play on?
---
Should’ve done it like N O to add some S P I C E
---
I use goat legs,evasive and gun fu now instead.
---
Yes.  Mole miner gauntlet plan is worthless because it's so easy to get.  Fixer plan is very expensive because it's relatively hard to get and highly sought after.
---
Is there a trick to donating?  I have over 1000 steel scrap but it wont let me donate anything. Keeps saying I don't have enough.
---
mostly on pc.  played a lot on ps4 too, but that's always felt a bit mushy and laggy in comparison.
---
I wanna go to the blue room.
---
You are wrong. Serendipity triggers constantly. It is really hard to die as an Unyielding unarmed demon. The only thing that kills me is poison and being ambushed/raped by mirelurk kings/hunters. I hit for 15000 before chems or food.
---
I mean I have the keys but I never look in the inventory for the key.. 
---
I just press x to open the door  if I ha e the key it be successful if I don’t it wouldn’t be.. there is Absolutely no point in going into inventory for keys
---
Not leave it on a ship for 6 years at a port in Beirut.
---
Level 64, but I’ve seen people with shotgun builds that one tap mirelurk queens
---
I agree. When the rewards are just boxes of grenades and alcohol I'd rather just keep my scrap. I don't feel any drive to participate. Im basically throwing scrap away for what? A double xp weekend? Meh. Fix the game.
---
It honestly depends. Once you get to a certain level you just know off the top of your head how rare a certain plan is so you price is based on that. In my experience most people sell your average run of the mill plan for about half of the in-game price. But rarer plans like Ultracite mods can go for thousands.
---
The whole legendary system is jacked and needs reworked, but let's be real BGS aren't going to change it. It's like a major update to CAMPs, would be great and is needed but not going to happen.
---
Agree. Though I don’t have 40000 cork-just a mere 1000.
---
Anytime Bethesda delays an update we eagerly want, i feel like they make a bad change inbetween that time. So my question is... what's coming next week?
---
[removed]
---
Yeah who woulda thought randomly killing someone out of the blue over something they may not have even intended to do would annoy them...
---
look on the bright side, this means that when we need to donate things like plastic and cork, we will easily have it done
---
I have less problem of people one-shooting things on PS4, but getting a tag on legendaries was difficult this week. People waiting at the spawn spots or glitching the mobs (Line in the Sand) mean that if you do not do it also, well you’re screwed. 
---
Less fun that way, but I suppose it will calm down when more and more people finish the Legendary Run
---
Even though he said he did
---
This is a joke...right?
---
I meant buying the majority of them.  3% isn't pay to win, imo.  You get 2000 atoms over the course of the run, so really it could have been those, but it doesn't matter.
---
um.
---
I hope so
---
Just started fo76 (lv24) and the way Ace says this is my favourite part of the game so far lmao
---
Irrational Fear. Protecting a Mr. Handy from honey beasts and Yao guais while he harvests honey. Great scrap, plus I get so much honey I just go talk to Sweetwater at the big teapot and pick up that quick daily.
---
Faaaak!  Why couldn't they call themselves the Brotherhood Of Cloth or Brotherhood Of Plastic!  :-)
---
The problem, specially with 2h melee, is that you really hit harder as a bloodied melee. I tried both things with my baseball player: vanguard instigating/antiarmor (roleplayed it: baseball bat and baseball grenades) and unyielding/bloodied. Bloodied felt like a killing machine: you cause waaay more damage. Too much damage. And once you have a taste of it, it is hard to go back.
---
If your name starts with an A, you have 2 childrens rides in your CAMP, and you're not crazy far from The Rusty Pick
---
Please. Please tell me you’re joking. Before I correct you on your mistake I need to know that you’re joshing.
---
SHHHHHH!!!
---
I ammmm I've been wondering how to build that!!
---
Starting to love project paradise cause of Yao guai
---
Need that acid !!!!
---
well, my metric has always been that, if someone has to ask if it's a joke, then it's not a very good joke.  but yes, twas a jape of foolishness on my part.
---
Leader of the Pack is my top go to. If I'm in a pinch and really need to do something, I'll go for Ag Center or whatever in Flatwoods.
---
West of vault 76 and just south of deathclaw island there's a river side junk deposit unused to camp at. Water and junk is nice early on.
---
I have 2200 hours in, my highest level is 190.
---
I was doing pretty good until the Assaultron from Hell demolished me in literally 2 seconds. 
---
And then my dumbass kept going back and getting demolished.
---
So I logged out and forgot about that quest. Like most of them lol.
---
1) Honest Hearts is one of the best DLC's in the entire Fallout franchise.  
---
 2) FNV had more player driven choices and storyline in the first ten minutes than Fo4 had in its entirety.   
---
So you base the entire two games off of  weapon customization and BoS involvement.   
---
Hate to break it to ya but the BoS have been a bunch of quivering babies in every single game.
---
Silent assassin is a viable build recently, especially with chinese stealth armour. And killing SBQ is a matter of weapons.
---
Only reason I stopped using is I got a SS Jetpack... and... I like running and jumping and flying around.
---
It’s a known bug, possibly related to playing Nuclear Winter.
---
did you play nuclear winter and then go into adventure? I think that is at least one of the causes. It should go away if you restart the game.
---
Pretty normal to preview a new product before it’s available.  Do people get upset when a product is launched at an event and you don’t already have one in your pocket? 
---
Oh right, Reddit does not do patience
---
You can adjust that metric. It was a humorous comment, but tone is sometimes lost via text. And doubly so on Reddit.
---
You're damn right
---
I use it as an excuse to move and rebuild my camp.  I’m a bit confused why people here don’t seem to want to reinvent their camps at new places with new themes
---
No but i was playing the game when i posted this
---
It's possible to cripple using natural limb damage, though the damage falloff due to the scorchbeast's range should've been too much for that to matter. But if you were using a Gauss shotgun, I think the built-in explosive damage (which, to my knowledge, ignores damage falloff) might still be enough damage to cripple.
---
Try removing Enforcer to compare?
---
That would be it then
---
Thats it
---
The pop-up ones: Lode bearing, Encryptid, Line in the Sand, the one with meditation speakers. 
---
The non pop-ups: any hordes, it’s a trap, air to ground support (right name?), census violence, awol... any really in the bog.
---
Personally I always have had one idea for what I want my camp to be, and I view my camp as more of a home for my character than a temporary setup. Just my take on it, I do like to see the stuff people make though.
---
yep. my first run through was fine, but I had to help a friend do it a few times because she kept getting stuck in that room.
---
Probably because the people organising such an event aren't the same ones actually working on the game
---
I have had only two or three trolls so far but other than that lvl87 right now and i also had a lot of people help me too when i was a lower level
---
1911
---
but I think it counts towards being nice to Ra Ra which you want.
---
I was just having this conversation with my boyfriend earlier. Old school power armors are definitely missed.
---
Okay, I'm just gonna take the R/Woooooooosh so no one else has to, but the Lone Wanderer perk doesn't work on a team whether you share it or not...*T-Poses* I'm ready.
---
AWOL and Heart of the Swamp were always a go to before wastelanders...even moreso now with groups
---
Is this influenced at all by the cube movies?  The concept is eerily simular
---
You have to be carrying it.
---
Irrational Fear
---
Everyone sleeps on it
---
That is pretty alarming since they still have a lot planned
---
It still sucks.
---
I’m pretty sure you are describing video games in general.... hardly wastelanders fault
---
"He will soon be better. He will soon be better. He will soon be better."
---
I low key hate it hahaha blame my ocd
---
is it somehow attached to the side of a foundation?
---
The m1 rifle
---
It's never 100% safe. My friends have lost many items before.
---
It's insanely easy to get an unintended wanted level. Shit like this is a large part of why I don't play on public servers. I don't want to be randomly obliterated by some high-level tryhard with nothing better to do than hunt down six cap bounties gotten because of the buggy, laggy nature of the game.
---
That Bloodied faster fire combat rifle is better than anything except a Fixer, radium rifle or handmade with those legendary effects, so, you can try to build around it. Powerful automatic receiver is a must and easy to learn. 
---
In the end, you will feel too powerful and try other things, but it is a great commando weapon when you have only 100 hours in.
---
Yeah, that's a cool one too.
---
Quite possibly, you are modifying the game in a way that isn’t theirs
---
Ah.  There are certainly a lot of cool American weapons, but few Americans seem to be interested in historical firearms of other countries in video games.
---
That's why I prefaced it with "participating in the event."  You'd have to be making some kind of meaningful contribution to the event, like how if you don't do enough damage to the Scorchbeast Queen, you don't get loot from her.
---
Yeah, Lone Wanderer doesn't work on Teams.  It's an understandable error.  Did the same thing.
---
My fave event. those yao guais are sometimes 3* legendaries and the bees can be crowns
---
in a INT build...awesome quick event
---
New Vegas had an easy to use ammo type selector.  Even too many ammo types sometimes
---
Bethesda your game right now is as reliable, desirable, and long lasting as a pensioners erection.
---
I pulled the same two star combat rifle from Mumbles. Named mine Bloodied Not The Fixer.
---
I stand duly corrected.  Thank you, sir.
---
A quad board would be like a melee spanking machine and imo, pretty cool.
---
Encryptid is a tough one, I'll do one in awhile 
---
If I do lode bearing solo I only activate two robots
---
Considering I one shot a lvl 91 deathclaw today, theres not need in my arsenal for limb damage 😜
---
Is it bulked? I had this issue earlier, just scrap it and it should turn in.
---
It was glorious, the chat went ballistic giving them shit.  Utterly fantastic.
---
Anthem 2.0 looks to be interest peaking btw.  Reworked loot table, and inventory management already in the new game, and they're still a year if not more out!
---
Dang should jump on tht one next time
---
I mean, guaranteed 3* drop, so 24/40 scrip is worse case
---
There's no need to bring maths into this equation.
---
She needs to go and shit on the developers desk. 
---
A material example of the playerbases opinion of the "content" from Bethesda.
---
It's not a dupe. Bethesda acknowledged that they are monitoring a performance issue.
---
Never heard of anyone banned for using mods. Plenty do use them on PC, including me ever since I got the game.
---
I consider this a feature
---
It has been like that with the patch that brought new Fasnacht plans, same time other people had issues with camp items from last year event.
---
Yup it's missing and has been acknowledged by Bethesda as a mistake. Now how long it takes to fix that mistake is anyone's guess.
---
Pretty sure they could see the dupers inventories without the event... their servers are the only record of said reserves after all
---
No just on top the of the floor foundation.
---
Why didn't they all just go fuck this, fuck it all, and walk off screaming fuck 76's management. 
---
Keep making excuses and tolerating it, and the management will keep pushing deadlines that cause more bugs and failures.
---
dodgy doesn’t run on anything... it’s a flat dmg reduction, and once again anyone can use that perk. Who on earth told you tanks can use agility??
---
And tanks once again can also use stealth. That is not a bloodied build. Idk why you’re making up what perks apply to which builds... either way, whether you thin stealth is defense your made up that bloodieds can take as much dmg as a full health. Hiding from enemies has nothing to do with taking dmg?
---
Is there anything of value or unique associated with turning the materials in? I’m a pretty casual level 214 heavy weapons build and rarely come across plans I don’t know. I’m more interested in using the steel to make ammunition if there isn’t something useful or unique involved with turning it in. 
---
I see that the steel bit is over, but the question stands because cork is about to start.
---
Personally, I would prefer a vendor that gives 1 token for every 250 steel/cork/cloth donated that can be used to purchase rare items or plans.  Relying on the RNG gods or hoping that a player vendor is selling the rare plan you need is extremely annoying.
---
I think it would be cool to have weapons that relate to the events of the Great War, namely Chinese weapons like the Type 91 or even that Walther rip off that half the world adopted, it was in Fallout 3 and goddamn I loved the RP potential~
---
Could the increase in HP have bumped you out if a low-health benefit like pushing you above 19% health for Unyielding?
---
Thanks for the info. We will get them by christmas im sure 😆
---
Same here
---
But if i am a melee build I have no use for a fixer plan... see how that works? I wouldn’t pay more than 100 caps for that plan but someone else would pay 10,000
---
I have a mini Mothman shrine room in my camp with a bowl of Nukashine. A mounted mothman and a punchbowl in front of him labelled "food".
---
Same problem here. On Xbox
---
Willing to give it all of my miniguns 5mm, I have 50,000 that no one buys lol
---
Hopefully behind the scenes some serious shit is getting thrown at the management for 76. The developers do not get enough time or weight for direction of resources.
---
I’d be down for that.
---
They’re not bad, don’t call them that. They’re your style of building.
---
I have to watch a video on the silo.  I've done the queen fight sooooo many times now.  I go every time she drops.  I just don't handle the excessive fire well sometimes, like Encrypted gives me such a migraine.
---
You can get all of the rewards. the one you don't side with will obv take the most grinding but you'll get there eventually.
---
No. Anything you find in Nexus is safe to use. There has been no bans from mod usage. There are loads of players who have used them since launch, like myself. Bughesda does not support mods, but they don't restrict the use of them. If they wanted to, they could disable them with a flick of a switch. Like they did in NW.
---
No they didn't.
---
Happened to me a few weeks ago
---
I was a bit confused that it was not at least a side quest for the first time you do it
---
You can side on one.  Grind out the dailies on both factions and become ally’s for both. Once you’re an ally you can buy the plans for the weapons and other things that come with each faction.
---
If you killed 1 every 100 hours 76 times that’s 100 atoms 💰
---
If Bethesda said they were adding historical weapons to this game from every country on earth except Finland, well first off I would be confused, but secondly I would still be happy.  Any historical weapon would be better than nothing.
---
Sprinting with Speed Demon would reset your life to whatever max health boosts you had if your health was lower than the boost.
---
I made a new character to do this stupid Score thing they have going on since my higher level would be a pain in the ass to level up constantly...anyways...when I was about level 5 or so in Flatwoods, I remember a higher level person dropped a bunch of aid items for me. It was pretty nice.
---
So what enhancements would you expect out of 76 for next gen consoles?
---
Really?  We should team together!
---
Caracas is the capital of Venezuela 😂
---
Yeah, right? Take the interior wall, which is already scripted "properly" and mirror it almost exactly on the other side, create a new wall type and implement it in the game. Not gonna insult anybody as incompetent - but come on, guys. You're fucking Bethesda. A company that seems to have forgotten, what games it has developed in the past. Can't figure out how to implement double-sided walls. Jesus.
---
Bethesda could fuck up finding people to enjoy an orgy at the Playboy Mansion.  They'd turn up with 2 nuns and a giraffe.
---
Thanks for the advice. I pulled a 3* radium rifle the other day but it didn't seem like it would be that great. Guess I need to actually give it a test run
---
This is my first camp without one. I actually had someone leave an offering at my last one.
---
GOD BLESS AMERICA
---
GOD BLESS THE ENCLAVE
---
Nope you got it, side with one, grind for the other.
---
Settlers gives you Chinese Stealth suit, Raiders gives access to Gauss Minigun.
---
So, sneaky, or gun that you need to buy 2 legendary modules to make, with no guarantee of what perks you will get.
---
But hey, I chose Raiders over Settlers mainly because I don't like the attitude of the Settler's head, Paige.
---
I believe the same was actually true for the creation club version in fo4, modders enabled it separately.
---
Do the quests for both until you have to side with one for the raid, this guarantees most of the rewards, the final quest has to be done with one or the other, completing in rewards a unique outfit from the faction an a boost to your rep with them, other than that, you shouldn’t miss out on anything
---
Not saying the Suomi wouldn't be welcome bc that gun would fit like a glove in this game, aesthetically wise~ it could well be an atom shop skin for the Thompson like how the M16 covered the handmade~
---
If I offer you a fixer plan for 2k, you should buy is and resell it for 7 or 8, which is a perfectly reasonable price, instantly and easily netting 5 or 6k... see how that works?
---
Complete bullshit and false news. I personally know ~20 people who have been using mods from day 1 (myself included). No bans.
---
EDIT: Those early bans were because some people used Cheat Engine.
---
It's not going to make a difference, she doesn't get disappointed or anything. Plus the conversations you have with most people don't have any weight later on in this game.
---
Couldn’t have said it better myself.
---
That's a good point.  You don't even need to make a new weapon, just make a weapon skin.
---
Possible fix- I joined a private world and analyzed the sample there. No idea why it worked but if you can, try it on a private world.
---
Do both up till until both factions get to the "Side with X" quest to maximise faction rewards and rep.
---
If you side with the Raiders there is a plasma weapon you can acquire depending on choices made earlier. If you miss it you can always keep your eye out on players vendors for one.
---
I think both sides have an outfit for siding with them. Thats basically it as far as "missable" loot rewards go. Everything else can still be obtained after you become full rep with each side. The rep grind can continue regardless of choice. Niether side will kick you to the kerb for not siding with them
---
I always have extra steel so railway spikes sounds like the way to go to me. Unless the conversion rate is just horrible or something? 
---
Didn't know about the harpoon gun flechette bug, but I just googled it, and WOW that's an old bug.
---
Sending mad dog malone back to prison....again
---
Yeah, I’ll send you an add
---
You know what I really want to see is the Lahti anti tank rifle.
---
Wow how the hell did I never noticed that. Thanks for the info
---
Ok, so tested at SBQ when three SB’s spawned in before the main event, and was reliably able to use criticals to land crippling hits on the wing from way beyond max damage range. Non-explosive shotgun, so I’m going to say that this perk is still working, but perhaps there has been some kind of nerf to overall efficiency of the effect.
---
These are my recommendations, use blocker instead of barbarian, get Bandolier instead of Traveling Pharmacy.  Get a chemist backpack from Crater, same as 3pts in Traveling Pharmacy.
---
Don't think you really need the chem perks in Endurance. 
---
One thing I started to do was not use Gunsmith, I run a lot of queens and have over 150+ repair kits.  That's 5 points you can use elsewhere if you have the same number of repair kits.  
---
Since they fixed it you may want to mix in at least a few points in Adrenaline.  I also experiment with putting a few in mister sandman.  I'm lazy so don't swap the cards out when its not night but its a nice bonus when it is.
---
This my junkie build, works for me but definitely find what you like [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=5f445cb&amp;d=p02pg2ph2pp2pi2c62ir2ar2an2ao0lu2lt2l71la2ii0sg2s01eh1ek1ce0s10a51a02&amp;w=ib0a72&amp;m=051c249febad&amp;am=182a-1820-1824-1721-18&amp;wp=w6w5w6&amp;wm=1125-142035-1b2937&amp;ad=058](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=5f445cb&amp;d=p02pg2ph2pp2pi2c62ir2ar2an2ao0lu2lt2l71la2ii0sg2s01eh1ek1ce0s10a51a02&amp;w=ib0a72&amp;m=051c249febad&amp;am=182a-1820-1824-1721-18&amp;wp=w6w5w6&amp;wm=1125-142035-1b2937&amp;ad=058)
---
I have some experience in tech support, did you try to restart your pc? This may sound like a joke but you would be surprised how many times this works even when it makes no obvious sense.
---
Same
---
I'm low level too and it makes the game so much better when I wave at a player and they wave back
---
I like how she didn't acknowledge it at all 😂😂
---
I still wish we had at least 25% of the building items from fo4. Felt so realistic and immersive with the way the “world was” after the bombs. Most of the stuff now a days is too cartoony for me. 
---
As always; that’s just my opinion.
---
If we had more run downed, rotten, paint peeled, sat in radiation for 100 years type stuff, I would like to make it seem more natural to the world.. one day, maybe lol
---
They’re leaving it behind it seems. I’m not surprised. The game is too far gone and will never be fixed to a decent standard.
---
Any bloodied automatic is an endgame piece. People don't like radium rifles because mods are absurdly hard to learn: you can scrap 30 and learn maybe one or two mods, maybe nothing.
---
Actual framerates.
---
Yeah that was my thought, but check for things beyond just damage dealt.
---
Am I the only person to play who hasn't encountered this bug? What is it?
---
I’ve only ever been wanted once in the game and a high level chased me down and murdered me (I didn’t fight back bc at the time I was level 10 and knew I didn’t stand a chance) but he left me some of my loot so that was nice.
---
Again we are talking about the value of something. Value is subjective. I appreciate you probably took some intro to economics course, but that doesn’t apply in a market with less than perfect information where people have different needs.
---
If price and value were universal, you wouldn’t be able to negotiate price ever lol
---
Also... value and price are not the same thing. So yes value very much is subjective.
---
Dope!
---
Really appreciate the responses...
---
I’m bout too google which outfits they hook ya up wit I s’pose,Lol
---
Stay Blessed
---
Lol, crying about not being able to use exploits 😂
---
Still useful for crit weeklies and for medic builds.
---
I get that. For me, I’ve moved it as my focus in the game changed, and I ended up spending most of the time in one area. I’ve had it in the forest, up by crater, down by foundation, over by top of the word at various phases. Mostly to save on the fast travel when doing parts of the main quests
---
Handmades, fixers, gauss rifles, lever actions. Especially lever.
---
Edit: slap suppressors and hardened relievers on anyone of those and run covert operative and sneak for agility. Luck - grim reaper sprint, psychopath, Crit savvy.. and you definitely want tank killer and tormentor.
---
Cool, but not many enemies deal energy damage and even if they do, I highly doubt they deal enough damage to even matter. You are better off just taking a Legendary Special for extra perks or the Poison Resistance for poison damage.
---
They already are, since that’s currently the only way aside from sneak (which is difficult due to only 5 of them having suppressors available) to match the damage output of other weapons.
---
Why I hardly ever bother with her. Total waste every time. My best drops have been from just randoms
---
I have a Suomi IRL and would LOVE to carry one in the game!
---
What do you mean
---
Oh and just so you know, you don’t even have to talk to the gutsy. Hop in there and push the button
---
Lever Actions at arguably the best non-automatic rifles. They have quite a fast rate of fire for it’s weapon type and excel at pretty much all ranges.
---
I mean, is it really a Fallout game if there aren’t random clipping bugs?
---
Am I the only one who doesn't care if my build is the most OP available?
---
I mean they experienced the fast travel bug so I definitely like they got their dose of karma. However I feel like they were showing it off to try and show us how the event goes and what to do (or at least try to).
---
I just cram mine for of water purifiers along a river and more on land
---
Never forget Bethesda introduced this game with a livestream of Ninja, Logic, and Rick &amp; Morty.
---
I’m lvl 110ish and I had a lvl 21 contest my workshop as I was defending it. He was helping out the first two waves, contested the shop but didn’t attack. I just figured noob didn’t know what they were doing. Then he started to attack my collectron. That’s a big no-no. Game over. Then he he came back for revenge! Kid could dance around pretty good, but in the end, I got his aluminum and left him his wood.
---
I used the already built fishing camp way up north on the river. Just put a shack down, a Red Rocket garage, and utilized stuff that was already there. It's fun to build off the environment.
---
I get a lot of hate here is legitmate.  But this seems like a feature, not a bug.
---
I imagine plenty of people were giving for the rewards;  lackluster they may be.  They were still better then steel sitting around.
---
Give me any gravity fed / bullpup weapon and i'm set, something like an M60 would make me buy Fo1st bc that gun is kachunck~
---
Edit: There really needs to be an Anti Material Rifle again, FoNV had that beautiful model, then Fo4 had the Atom Shop one that performed like a wet noodle~
---
I don't know why they have something against rifle builds? Like the 50.cal reciever on the hunting rifle does what? 3 damage more than a hardened receiver without perks? Like uhhhh
---
Todd blessed you.
---
Boards can be pretty damn awesome sometimes. My ghoul slayers FSS board tears up whitespring
---
about 3 hours 5 minutes when shes trying to fast travel out of the nuke zone
---
I don’t see a problem going over the limit, steel is a very easy resource to find plus I like to get extra crates so I can give them to lower level characters.
---
I cleared my steel out the first day.
---
Was 18k when I checked earlier already...
---
Hate to break it to you, but it was an event with no more or less impact on the world than any other in this game.  Some people enjoyed it,
---
Others didn’t. It did nothing to harm you
---
Not me, but I wish him luck.
---
Um... the backpack has 60 carry weight. Craft the level 50 version.
---
Me three, when I started out around a month ago it was either harassment or nothing at all. Whenever I came across other players they would most often be completely ignoring me and each other. 
---
I ended up playing a private server for a month (since it was like the same thing without the negatives), but now that I'm back in public people seem to be more engaging. Might be due to the new public team thing.
---
Gotta be careful when doing this too because sometimes the game will kill you once the Buffout wears off because now your rads are greater than your health pool so you'll sometimes be alive with zero health or I've had it just outright kill me before too, ha.
---
Here ya go! You also catch a quick glimpse of the 3\*Furious Rolling Pin at the beginning.  
---

---
This isn't a "Long-term plan" like Elder Scrolls Online, and this isn't Bethesda's Recent Best like Doom: Eternal.
---
It's an entry in the Fallout series, it was created using 90% of Fallout 4's assets as a side venture (You can even tell they started working on it around when Nuka-World was being developed, since that's pretty much the only content that didn't make it over), and it's just supposed to hold over fans until the next Fallout or Elder Scrolls game.
---
Damn that sucks. I haven’t used gauss since the patch but that’s sad to hear, hopefully it gets fixed
---
If your on Xbox I have an Instigating Gauss rifle and an AA lever action if your interested in them for a swap of some kind
---
Of..... cork?
---
You’re reading too much into it. Especially since the full announcement clearly indicates other titles will be upgraded for free.
---
I was surprised I had so much of it when I checked before the event started. Also made me realize I had a lot of other items I never use/ could clean out of junk and reclaim nearly 50 in storage space
---
Funny.
---
Didn't someone actually determine that Lone Wanderer DOES work for some reason because of how these new teams are designed?
---
I can't believe I didn't think of that. Or look it up. I can be such an idiot.
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
Its a internet issue. The only time I have this happen is when my game is laggy  and the enemy is standing there frozen. Other than that its fine.
---
My bloodied character with healing factor mutation has the fast travel blues. My bloodied character without healing factor travels first time every time.
---
Im looking forward to finding out what the rewards are, that's as far as it is for me!
---
I understand the point of not wanting to do the nuclear winter challenges that force you to kill other players (but for that my friend and I have a work around) since it’s hard to do but for the easier ones like place your camp three times or survive those are really easy challenges. I’m not including the kill x amount of creatures since that can sometimes be hard if not a lot of creatures spawn/ all your team mates kill them/ they’re harder to kill enemies without attracting attention to yourself like the Grafton monster is.
---
Get a 5th addiction.
---
Perk cards are entirely dependent on what kind of weapon you want
---
I dont even have a radcleaner.
---
That was exactly it.  I always think of the Buff chems as just boosting strength.  I forgot about the health boost!
---
80% of my interactions with other players are positive. 
---
Makes me happy when I see people being good to each other.
---
I'm suffering this issue too
---
Better to just let the dupers do it. As a new player, the reward boxes don't even have anything valuable for me either, trash and plans that i've bought out of peoples machines for 5-20 caps each
---
Alot of events do get ruined because of this and turned me off of them for a bit, but now I just dont care and I won't be that guy so I just dont shoot till I see it's about to die then I'll kill it, unless in solo then its 1 shot everything because its efficient and fun!
---
Whoa. Copy that   :)
---
Why is it so hard to get rads? There are so many places and monsters and foods and items and weapons and events that can guve you rads that you shouldnt have to worry about getting your rads back. Also are you really that weak without your precious rads?
---
Thats internet issues. Your doing 0 damage and missing cause the mutant moved. But your screens showing him not. 
---
There's no patching that will help except you patching up your wallet after it gets ripped apart from a better internet package
---
Fake!!
---
I wish, tesla was my favorite as well, even if it's just released as a skin
---
Here you go, u/Vissarionn \- clip as requested. Plus a glimpse of the Furious Rolling Pin!  
---
cant get better, and fo76 is the only that sucks the rest I play with no issue.
---
The outfits are pretty meh. The settlers give you the workers outfit which is just some dickies and hat. The raiders give you the fashionable raider outfit. Which imo doesn’t look that great either. I personally say side with the raiders if you want the Armco ammo machine quicker, side with the settlers if you want the gauss shotgun quicker. If you don’t do any of the settlers quests you will have to buy the Chinese stealth suit with gold. Otherwise you get the suit for free pretty early on in their quest line. 
---
Personally I say side with the settlers because their quest line is much shorter, easier and less buggy than the raiders. The raiders quest line is riddled with bugs like not being able to enter a specific cave, or one of the npc’s not functioning mid quest, or all of the npc’s not functioning during a quest. Completing it with the settlers will get you on your way to earning gold bullion and treasury notes much much quicker.
---
Edit: as one other post noted, if you raid the vault with the raiders there is a 3 star legendary plasma rifle called the Slug Buster. I don’t remember all the stats on it because I thought it was rather unimpressive, you may be interested in that sort of weapon. Google slug buster. Oh and start saving your 2mm electromagnetic cartridges. You’ll need them for the gauss weapons.
---
It makes no sense at all how being strung out on drugs or half dead magically makes a specific gun do tons more damage. The legendary system in it's entirety doesn't belong in a game without magic. An explosive weapon should require explosive ammo rounds, etc. Then they doubled down on ridiculousness with mutations having negligible downsides if you spec right. There should be a viable build path for someone who wants to make a logical character. Full health, no drugs or mutations should not make you deal a fraction of the damage the other builds have.
---
Funny story. 
---
For optimal results use Ammosmith too if you don't do already.
---
So weapons nobody uses, so sad.
---
Guided meditation. Experience, legendaries, and rewards better than radiation rumble, without the collection or bossy players. 
---
Awol at night with an instigating lever action.
---
Yeah, low health, not being careful. And actually the gun went PEWPEWPEW. More like a one-burst.  LOL
---
If you have it on gamepass, play it yourself and make up your own mind. 
---
I say yes
---
Okay. It's a server connection issue nothing they can do will help it lol. Latency. The amount of time it takes for your computer to send a command and get a response. Like frame rates except lower = better
---
Because there's a difference between something being delayed for fine tuning and something being delayed because it's so behind/broken that it barely even functions?
---
Because there's a difference between dev builds and live builds?
---
Because they were playing under controlled conditions?
---
I mean what the fuck do you people want?  This sub is 99% screaming about how fucking buggy the game is and how bethesda doesn't test shit and just releases everything broken and yet when they actually push something back because they're not happy with how it performs it's nothing but shitting on them for that as well?
---
Make up your fucking minds already, do you want them to just push out shit so it breaks as soon as we touch it and run here to bitch or do you want them to attempt to make sure they actually release shit in working condition for once?
---
No freaking way.  Bethesda is introducing bugs into my humor now?  @\*&amp;#\*&amp;!
---
Wow. That is the hotness.
---
&gt; FNV had more player driven choices and storyline in the first ten minutes than Fo4 had in its entirety. 
---
Yeah except this objectively isn't true.
---
Hmmmmmmm now there’s something.
---
I was selling my Mounted Beaver plans for 69 and never sold one.  
---
I got a laugh though, so, there was that at least.
---
God knows what I have going on, but I will definitely check.😄
---
Thank you! You're a gentleman and a scholar.
---
I'm not surprised, tbh.
---
Except those damn mirelurk kings... Couple poison attacks and you're a canned meat stew
---
Christmas 2077 maybe 😂
---
Lol
---
New Vegas fans when someone points out the bugs and flaws in the game: "well its bethesda's fault!"
---
New Vegas fans when someone praises the game and says it's amazing: "it's not a bethesda game!"
---
I just did that.  No luck.
---
We'd only get 10 caps for killing you, you'd net much more for killing us!
---
Did you eat a lot of paint chips as a child?
---
Even new players have most of these plans though, I'm a new player and have found like 90% of these plans in vending machines for roughly 5-20 caps each. only been playing a week or two and even I don't have any incentive to donate
---
New Vegas, the game so perfect... everyone mods the shit out of it.
---
See you back after the next update when you tell us you cancelled your 1st sub again, but for really really reals.
---
Isn’t the caps cap still 30k? How would you sell it 42k?
---
Plasma gun with a flamer barrel. Counts as non-auto and the dps is fast like an auto.
---
It will be released for everyone at a later date
---
Personally I don't go after wanted players because I remember the time I picked a lock on a safe at the airport workshop that had been claimed then subsequently abandoned by another player. I became wanted (for not first overtaking the workshop before I started looting it) and another player, not the one who previously claimed the workshop mind you, mini-gunned me to death. So whenever I see a wanted player I know he's either intentionally trolling or just made a simple mistake while playing. Either way I'm not getting involved.
---
I haven't seen this encounter in a long ass time. And that time I followed him a good ways until they are disappeared when my back was turned to kill some wild mongrels.
---
ah good suggestion thanks :D
---
Um the rest of the games plot, side quests and exploration?
---
Here you go!

Edit: This is just for apparel. You can also find a price check for armor and weapons at:
---
[https://fed76.info/pricing/](https://fed76.info/pricing/)
---
It will tell you about legacy weapons, price and you will find a trend on how much everything is after awhile.
---
Same here. Fancy pump action to a limb in VATS is 99% of the time a one shot for me.
---
Always forget about those hell creatures. Don't run into them too often, thankfully
---
This is the case for all damage sources vs all numeric resistances, FYI. The higher your resistance, the less damage you take, but it’s a curve- it takes more and more numeric resistances (rad resistance in your case) to get a noticeable increase against the same damage value. Where it counts is against big damage hits, but those basically don’t exist for radiation, so anything over 50 rad resist is rapidly reducing in value; I don’t bother trying to push over 90 (lead lined backpack) myself. Beyond that is where % reduction effects matter, which is why Hazmat/Chinese stealth suits and Power Armor are so powerful- they have 95/90% rad reduction IN ADDITION to their numeric values. 
---
But this is the same reason people talk about 350 being the “soft cap” for DR. Against most enemies, it takes a LOT more armor to have a noticeable difference (big hitters like the alpha’s may be more noticeable), and why Vanguard/Bolstering armor really isn’t that great depending on your armor type and build (I’ve got nearly 500 dr/ER in my Solar suit on my Junkie tank, with mixed Lifesaving, enemy-specific, and one Mutants. If I was running SS I’d be over 600 without any Vanguard’s).
---
Rolling pin is the best weapon in the game.
---
Did you check your permissions in windows firewall?
---
As much fun as gunning down a helpless vault dweller is, overseer xp is *heavily* weighed toward time survived versus player kills. I think someone did the math and you could kill every other person in the lobby and you'd still get more experience for lasting 15 minutes.*
---
If you aren't comfortable or even good at PvP, bushwookie-ing is often times the best bang for your buck. The long lobby times only exacerbate the problem. Bethesda could easily solve this by making kills worth way more experience, but it doesn't seem likely. 
---
*citation needed
---
Boy, I wish that were true. You should try my build sometime, see how the game is a massive struggle for some of us. Bleah.
---
Mules or total value, say a guy has 10k caps, a  handmade worth 20k caps and 10k 5.56 rounds. That’s around 40k in value.
---
Hmmm... searched for your tag on Xbox live and didn’t find you?  Swing by my camp sometime - Psilenser
---
...Does it matter? The game has always been optimised like garbage. It drops to fucking 40fps on high end PCs.
---
They're never going to make this game not laggy.
---
I beat the run very quickly because my build is 15 intelligence.  Now I barely play because every time I see a score notification pop up I get annoyed that it's worthless.  
---
My camp is built around a pre-existing structure, so I'll never use the fireplace door.  I would have rather gotten more lunch boxes.
---
I tried to solo Radiation Rumble yesterday by crippling and noticed it didn't work because everything was dying in 1 shot.
---
Oh well.
---
Have they really? They gave it to Respawn?
---
Np.
---
Oh my god lmaooo
---
Just get a full suit of t-65 and a gauss minigun like pshhhhh who dont have one
---
Just my thoughts, feel free to take or leave, but you could drop gunsmith if you have weapon artisan unless you really hate repairing. Since you aren't using an automatic that would probably get you enough mileage and you could put five points somewhere else. 
---
Fireproof and adamantium skeleton are suggested a lot for survivability. Blocker in strength. Serendipity is an option. 
---
For damage, tormentor and bloody mess. One point in adrenaline gets you a good chunk of the bonus at low cost. Tenderizer too. 
---
If you aren't using VATS much due to the core consumption you could drop conc fire.
---
I can't wait to get my hands on the harpoon gun, maybe all the bloodied commandos won't like it but that thing will rip Earl apart in the hands of a competent heavy guns user
---
That makes sense. 👍
---
With the rapid reload bug it may be viable!
---
If i saw them I definitely would have bought one
---
Absolutely, if you're solo then you can call in an Orbital Bombardment and it's all Gucci, but this wave of domination and legendary supression leaves me not wanting to complete these kind of events bc my time is wasted by someone who rocked up in the last second to snag the kill.
---
I could be farming somewhere random and have more fun than engaging with others for an event in this game and that's kinda sad~
---
Granted, it's only occasionally you spot the turtle out of the shell but the risk of 4-7 minutes in an event for that end boss to be snuffed by some demigod on a roof turns me off the idea quicker than Kit Fisto's death.
---
If this did not work try refreshing your launcher to see if you have the newest version.
---
FN P90, now there's a bullpup.
---
That's so cool.  How did you come to acquire it?
---
I'm sorry, but what kind of box is that?
---
Join a public team. Building or events. Stash all your junk and do events even if it says level 50 recommend. Get hits on as many enemies as possible (10mm pistol would be good) and you will get experience for the "kills" you are going to die...a lot. But the only thing you lose when you die is the junk that is no longer on you so you lose nothing. If your on a team with higher level people follow them around and get hits on anything they are gonna kill. I'm level 200 with 500 hours into the game and if a level 10 were to follow me around as I kill everything in westek I won't care as long as you don't actively try to annoy me. Hell I'll prolly drop you stims and radaway and make sure you get your hits in before I melt every enemy as we go.
---
Doesn't MAKE you do shit all unless you have the will of a cat following a laser pointer.
---
I wanted to like the lever action but it's low ammo cap 
---
Was a bummer
---
Ah, sure.  To you, it's valueless, put not priceless, no?  Like gold in a desert.
---
The game is a personal arms race...It outright says it enough times lol
---
I sell all my legendaries I dont want for under a 100 caps each, they don't last long!
---
With a big sign that say "Cheap Legendary"
---
The entire overseers journey, side quests, events. Do the responders quests, firebreathers, etc. When you get to level 25 def do mistress of mysteries also
---
It certainly incentivizes you to do a series of tasks vs just enjoying the open world game
---
I think 500 scrap for 50 bullion would be more reasonable, but  we all know how reluctant Bethesda is to add actually convenient features into the game.
---
No, I just made a couple purchases. I'm XBone, too.
---
It's been 2 years and this subreddit still hasn't learned that the community managers have no input on the actual development of the game.
---
You have to learn all the mods except for the prime receiver by scrapping gatling guns. You can buy the plan for the gatling gun from trader Phoenix in Watoga. If you're looking for lead, Lucky Hole mine has a bunch of ore, remember to bring your excavator armor. As for aluminum, I know there's a small deposit in the south bend tunnel, but not a huge amount.
---
There is no point in making a camp anymore they *𝗽𝗮𝘁𝗰𝗵𝗲𝗱* building and its f*cked
---
Not sure if this helps but I'm on PS4 and it's up
---
Oh of course.  Killing a mob that's attacking a node (i.e. defending), putting macguffins into the thing for event credit, repairing event structures that are broken, etc etc etc.  Plenty of ways you can check to make sure someone is actually participating and not just idling AFK.
---
Isn't acting like everything is fine the go-to response to demonstrating anything in general?
---
But if you're shit out of luck with my suggestions you should try these options by bethesda or try to reinstall your launcher (I do not believe you'll have to install the game again) https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/44851/~/what-do-i-do-if-fallout-76-on-pc-is-having-connection-issues%3F
---
You could of course try to launch fo76 from the desktop. Which I realize now should have been my first suggestion to troubleshoot if it was a launcher issue or a game issue.
---
I don’t have very much free time, just game with some buds on 76 a few times a week for a small while. The game is fun and easily manageable even if you don’t sink tons of time into it. Like, sorry you’re butthurt that the game doesn’t cater specifically to you. The grind is only bad if you have a juvenile need for instant gratification
---
No, because there is nothing good on the loot list for this event baggy.

Heard you can get some kind of special hat or something but as someone that doesn't have fallout 1st I don't have a huge amount of anything so I did the same, one donation of 250 steel... saw what I got and noped on out of there real fast. This isn't an event, not sure what to call it, but definitely fascnat good. God I miss fascnat 😒
---
I Get you!!!! ITS THE BEST COMMUNITY!
---
I think the reason Bethesda made alcohol such a common reward for donating is so we can drink away our sorrows once we realize how shitty the rewards are.
---
They seem to get the power attack damage bonus when they charge and I think it has armor pen like Incisor on it or something as a charred are one of the only things that can 1 shot me (while bloodied.)
---
They die easily enough though so it isn't an issue, and make Guided Meditation so lucrative for XP.

First he said ps4  so to compare steam to it is moot. I had a server with4 people shut down this morning does that mean ppl left? No. Does that mean The Shard probably was below the minimum for it to maintain its activity? Maybe.
---
Whats so bad about it? Its amazing
---
Snallygasters and crickets are much more time efficient for acid when you need it.
---
 How is it there is so many people who have no caps and are concerned about the cost of traveling?
---
Yeah, except they always appear out of thin air and sneak up on you every freakin' time the scorched earth completes :D
---
I've been testing in game and have noticed the following:
---
1. Explosive damage no longer cripples.
---
2. Shooting directly at a ghoul's legs (or a scorchbeast's wings) still seems to cripples as expected.
---
3. Rubber-banding of shotgun damage has been fixed for weaker enemies so if you have a magic effect, shooting something outside of VATS now kills most weaker enemies outright. 
---
If the Enforcer perk appears to no longer have a cripple effect, then something else weird is going on because shooting something directly with Enforcer still seems to cripple as far as I can tell.
---
Are there any other perk stacking considerations like this?  This is news to me.
---
I started hoarding cork when this was announced.
---
I now have 100 more cork!
---
I'm sure this will go well.
---
Just gotta keep scrapping gatling guns. Doing the lucky hole mine with your excavator is the best way to get a ton of lead at once. Farming workshops is also good tho. Grafton Steel and Lakeside Cabins were my go to spots. Especially GS because you get a ton of steel too. For aluminum definitely take Red Rocket Mega Stop, there are 3 resources there you can farm at once
---
Seems like my firewall wasn't on.  I'm fixing that now.
---
No.
---
Idk about other platforms but I have maybe twice since BETA ever become wanted accidentally on XB.
---
Wtf, I literally just made a shotgun alt yesterday...Complete waste of 20 levels :))))))
---
Fuck Bethesda, seriously
---
I'm curious to see how much the cursed damage increase is. If this guy can be soloed (which he has been built times on pts) then in a decent group almost anything will be "viable".
---
Alright, I did some testing and made this chart: https://i.imgur.com/4h0YQNv.png
---
So yeah, the effect starts to diminish pretty quickly. It's practically useless after around 300, just like all the other resistance types.
---
EDIT: Here's the same chart on a better scale - https://i.imgur.com/bUnw5uZ.png
---
Safe at Red Rocket Mega will make you wanted too even though it's not red.
---
I made a new character the day after that event started, I played to around level 6 and I wound up with enough steel. I thought I'd go by there and at least get a plan that I didn't have on that character, well, no...it's four bottles of liquor and some caps. Huge waste of 250 steel.
---
I went by on one of my veteran characters the day the event started, and donated 500 steel, wound up with the Mole Miner Gauntlet and Laser Gun Plans, and a bunch of liquor. 
---
Not donating any more resources.
---
He doesnt care, bethesda bad obsidian good.
---
It never had nor never will have a crafting option.
---
They'll show in the atomic shop
---
All you need to do to not waste thousands of rounds is keep an ultracite gatling laser and use it against her. Bloody or not it's going to get the job done and hardly cost you anything.
---
I enjoy FO1st. I’ve played FO3-present as a junk hoarder, so that infinite junk stash is helpful.  I played on private for a while, but moved back to public with the public teams.
---
Edit:
---
About stealing from your base, people can unlock your collectors, but it’s not like you’re losing much.  They only go up to 10 for the standard resource collectors.
---
Haha yea I completely agree, it is really nice though when you find an event with a bunch of other high levels but everyone's on the same page and doesn't just hog everything
---
Agreed. I still don't understand why they give such low xp for player kills. I find myself usually only playing NW during double XP weekends
---
They need an easier way to report using an algorithm. If a player gets enough reports, whatever that number is they get a time out. There are some good players that will no doubt get reported because they dropped a player but if you build the logic correctly those really cheating will stand out.
---
I’m stuck on this as well. Have tried every workaround, put the fuse in first, join new world... I don’t have the blood sample in my inventory any longer and there is not option to go get a new one.
---
It'd be interesting to test since I got meatpiles replaced by a mod. But I haven't had much incentive to log on after finishing the season so I guess I'll just sit on a fence for a while. Hope the fix won't take till patch 34.
---
If the community donates X amount of steel by a certain date (sorry I don't remember the numbers) we'll get some cool cosmetics apparently. While the loot from the baggies is not good the overall loot from the event with hopefully be decent
---
Amazing!
---
Hey now! Rolling pins are awesome!
---
You can use them to make cookies!
---
Today I picked up a bloody/vatscrit/weightless bow for 2500 caps from a player living south of the golf club.  I couldn’t believe it.
---
Try Harpers Ferry vendor or the Train Station down in the Cranberry Bog. May be able to find some there.
---
They are quite tasty.
---
Crazy theocracy doing crazy things.
---
You KNOW all that cork is going to be warehoused and will eventually explode because BOS is just as crazy.
---
All of your statements are factual. Add in that there was never a set release date for this feature.
---
It's hard to tell sometimes if a lower lvl toon is a newbie or alt, cuz I'll run into some savvy lower levels and as a triple digit guy can't do a generic oh hey here's a bunch of stuff drop. On my first camp a lvl 30 smthng bought up a bunch of stuff including a novelty mothman lecture note i set to 666 caps. So i put on the firebreathers helm and suit, equipped a flaming chainsaw, and followed him over to grafton parade event, where he did the group picture emote, and i crouched near him, revving the flaming chainsaw... Then i dropped a dozen berry mentants for him and left, haha.
---
Another time a guy purchased all my extra mags for 10c a pop, so i asked him if he had any of the holotape games. He didn't, so i went over to grafton dam and found grognak and the ruby ruins or w/e, took a pic and messaged him that, since the other ones are random spawns.
---
The game makes for some akwardness tho. I had another low level dude show up as i was building my new camp, and he started playing the guitar. So i dropped a guitar weapon in front of him that was the same as his lvl and gave a lame thumbs up. Cant always get fixers, eh
---
It can't be healing factor causing it - I've had it applied for months, and I've only experienced the fast travel bug like 3 or 4 times
---
I guess it all depends on what you want to do. I run a furious commando, and I have a hard time not pulling mass aggro from the queen.
---
His own, if you can call his spine-disfiguring naps halfway through the floor and wall sleeping.
---
Cork. It's the super secret currency of the fallout underground. Sort of like SoJs from D2
---
250 steel for small holiday gifts - no thanks
---
Same, just what the fuck man. Only got my bloodied gauss last week and was about to pull the trigger on the prime receiver plans.
---
Why do I even still play this game.
---
It was Bethesda's fault for the ridiculous bugs that riddled New Vegas. They were responsible for QA for New Vegas, not Obsidian. They were the ones who had the final say on whether it was ready or not. They obviously thought it was.
---
:(
---
If Bethesda wasn't so incompetent I would be really excited about the potential.
---
Enemies only show up as red on your compass when they’re actively hostile to you (searching for you while you’re sneaking and still in “caution” still counts for this). That’s it. No idea if that’s a deliberate design change from FO4 or if it’s yet another bug that’s lasted since launch.
---
Recon scopes are trash now. They used to work pretty well at launch, but about 6 months in they got broken and barely work at all. They’re still good as a generic scope, but the recon function is nearly useless.
---
Speaking of constipated, have you guys seen the movie "Constipation" ?  
---
No?
---
That's cause it hasn't come out yet!
---
Not sure.  This is a fairly common thing though for events.  Check map, make sure it isn't showing up.  If it is, it could be under ground and can sometimes be lured out with loud weapons or moving around.
---
You can milk it lol
---
Well if you're there for SCORE and a change of scenery, it's a pisser.
---
Im sure I'll kill more than enough AFK-ers then if they're so prolific.
---
Go explore the map. 
---
I started character number 5 yesterday and I just got to LVL 10, I've been going and failing at events, hiding from and sniping at high level mobs. This part of the game is the most fun part of the game where everything can wipe you out in a second. 
---
I was LvL 7 last night, and I started Ridin' Shotgun, I figured someone else would eventually show up, but it wasn't until I had nearly exhausted my small supply of peas that someone came and finished off the legendary boss, just in time for the event to fail because of the time I spent fighting the legendary with LVL 5 weapons! LOL. However, I did wind up with a LVL 5 piece of armor that will be useful for a while.
---
840 now, 7600h = 760 atoms since p21
---
With how they currently have it set up, when you are playing a private world, you are temporarily renting a server, and then when you log off,  after several minutes they reboot said sever for someone else to use, wiping all information on that server. They would need to somehow store the information of your claimed workshops, similar to camps, and then when it detects you entering it in a private world that you hosted only(not your friend's private world or main worlds) then have it spawn your saved workshops back. This would probably be better if they implemented a way of storing private world sever information on your PC for persistence/and or your account or figured out a better way to their sever solution. 
---
At a glance, or if it was a different studio, I could see this being eventually implemented. W*ith that said...* combined with the devs team lackluster method to fixing bugs/exploits, the ability of releasing new features, it is currently very doubtful that we are going to get it anytime soon. 
---
I hope I am wrong because I would love new building areas and workshop persistence but they are having trouble just implementing a new event, and we know that has been a colossal problem for them. I fear for them trying to implement workshop persistence or anything involving private worlds. Their brains might explode lol. ^(or the whole game..)
---
“Truth is... this game was rigged from the start.”
---
Just had the exact same thought. I mean, if you're not able to wallpaper roofs or anything, it wouldn't surprise me at all if it was intended that you could only wallpaper just plain walls.
---
Given that as the publisher and the ones responsible for doing QA, yes the bugs are in fact Bethesda's fault. They had the final say on when and if the game was good to release. They obviously thought it was in good shape despite crashing every 5 minutes or every loading screen on launch.

Thank you! I will look into this.

I said at night because I one shot every gutsy. With it primed it also one shots scorched without stealth. It has uses, and is very ammo efficient. I also run quick hands, great perk for that and my lmg.
---
Fun fact though, the Pip-Boy holotape games run on flash.
---
Whether or not flash games are canon is up to you, haha.
---
I have full stealth setup, 8/9 rifle perks, tank buster, bloody mess, 4/5 unyielding gear (I kept 1 chameleon for now), nerd rage, adrenaline reaction, and a bloody gauss. I can one shot anything but the really big critters who are oddly resistant (SB's of course, Queens of both types, fog crawlers, and sheepsquatches). At this point, I am not sure what else I can realistically add to increase damage, unless I delve into crits which I prefer not to.
---
I have not seen the "very little damage" bug Andres mentioned... or else it always applies and I'm beating that much ass. Either way, three shots max on nearly anything, so not too bad, and way better than my pre-bloody sniper work.
---
Right now, i am just saving ym excess of levels for when I get bored and want another respect. maybe I'll get the gauss shotgun and wreck face, who knows.
---

Was just coming here to check this same thing. Just got off work and wont load into private.

And it's actually something we won't see. Beth just can't afford bad publicity with all their major fuck-ups. I predict they'll put us ~30mil over the limit by the end of last day no matter what.
---
Nocturnal is worse than stalkers. Most servers I’m in at least, it’s always day, and nocturnal reduces damage during the day. Who likes playing when it’s night?

At least its not me but thats so frustrating.

Uranium fever cuz it usually takes care of 2 or 3 dailies (3 legendaries ! Glowing creature, kill X amount of creatures) and I get my daily requirements of wood, steel and shotgun ammo from all the drops.
---
Fertile soil if I need a quick event for a daily
---
Silent night (?) At the dane compound for mostly the same reasons as Uranium fever, but it lacks the resource gathering.
---
Thank you for sharing. You're not wrong in anyway. They've set this game up like a chore. I inevitably I'll reach the same tipping point you did. I hope all this backlash helps people from top down making better choices but I doubt it. F to all the Devs geting put on blast. F
---
dude, you've put in 2000 hours. that would burn you out of *any* game. you can take a break and play something different until new content comes out.
---
Loved the patch notes too, though. *This update brings the event ... except the event isn't available in this update for you to play.* So yeah, basically, this update did not bring the event, but eh, semantics, I guess?
---
Dude, they lie about deadlines all the time and still push buggy content when it does drop. There will be gamebreaking bugs when this boss is added, book it
---
Cleaning out duped stashes, but at what cost.

Dang! Thank you!

Another [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i5o780/enforcer_no_longer_has_cripple_effect/g0r4cb5/) has reported more findings. I've updated the original post with links to their comment and yours.
---
And why can't posts go into the ground anymore? What exploit were you trying to solve by removing that pre-update 21?

I mean... you’re literally wrong about it not reducing damage during the day so your argument is baseless

nv fanboys always have 500 excuses for Obsidian even though every game Obsidian has ever made has *also* been buggy as fuck.
---
Exactly!
---
At first I didn’t really like it because I was terrible at it. Now that I’ve gotten the hang of it, it’s so easy and actually enjoyable :) 
---
Also did you farm the beeswax from Fasnacht to get lots of acid? Fun way of getting it back then too lol
---
The only thing worse is the countdown timer starting and immediately stopping without you going anywhere. Then it happens again. And again. And finally just the normal having to click 5 times. Very rarely will it actually work properly
---
another good thing about junkies vs bloodied, junkies needs no perk cards, of course at the cost of a little bit of damage but junkies is an amazing rival to bloodied and I'd say probably the only rival.
---
Not sure if you're trolling or not, but dodgy chips 30 ap every time you get hit. If you have 700 AP from unyielding, you will tank more hits. Do you get it now or not?
---
They don't really have incentive to. Hypothetically there's cheaters with millions of resources available to donate, is a beret or a yard sign enticing enough to make them mash X several thousand times each?
---
There is a website that lets you add all your info to it to build out your character and gives reasonable explanations for it.
---
Hmm, another [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i5o780/enforcer_no_longer_has_cripple_effect/g0r0a4b/) also reported Enforcer seemingly working. I've updated the original post with links to their comment and yours.
---
I'm not suggesting they lower the SCORE per day. Just give you some options in what you want to do.
---
Thanks man, but I’ve already acquired the plan for it.
---
Wht I never did those events 
---
But then again i wasn't in major need of acid till now
---
My camp builds take six hours to get right sometimes.
---
I usually repair the juke and sit on top one of the half walls out of ghoul reach for the most part
---
Other comments have reported Enforcer seemingly still working, despite what the data tables indicate. I've updated the original post with links to the comments.
---
Wow..great deal!
---
Non automatic rifles are super efficient in ammo consumption compared to automatic rifles and does the same amount of damage vs automatic rifles. Dps is the main difference and what people want and yes it does shred through things fast and its fun but the excessive ammo usage its downfall, even when you do just barely pull the trigger for burst shots. I've tried automatic on my bloodied handmade an just prefer it to be a single shot rifle so I don't burn through ammo and don't have to keep crafting a ton of ammo. But that's just my preference.
---
Oh, I always wondered what duping was
---
The only problem for people with an accidental bounty is that they can't see other players icons or camps/shops on the map. It's why you sometimes see a wanted player going to public events like Scorched Earth. Even then 9 times out of 10 they usually aren't killed until after the event is completed and they can stash their flux. Sure there's some horror stories but there are also a lot of cool people playing this game.
---
Mine! Jealous? No? Understandable.

Someone grabbed something off me at gorge junkyard and he went in the house. There’s only one way in. I cornered him and he turned around and crouched so I can execute him. All I did before he decided to do that was stand in the doorway and stare at him for 10 seconds.

Thats my gf lol

i know that mate, but take the stupid shroud of the avatar that is way worst and not even and A game and I can play on my crap xps that I use a knife to power on with no problem at all even lotro I can play with no server problems. so no not my ISP or devices problem couse I play on a ps4 (brand new one).

took me 3200 hours into GTA V for me to finally quit lol, and that game is a REAL. shit show.

Having crash problems on PC as well.

I think it may just be something with the patch.

oh my god you get 100 10mm ammo and 100 556 ammo every 20 minutes im gonna report you. someone placed 2 at my camp and I can tell you it is literally useless, unless you have more than like 10 I could see them having no positive effect whatsoever
---
Try Last Laugh instead.
---
Your whole argument is skewed in favour of unlocking the tacky cosmetics. If you're in there to fight and survive and test yourself, the XP is somewhat irrelevant. PvP should be about the challenge, not a fucking ghillie suit or some other crap. 
---
Ill go right ahead and guess you hid in a bush, got your little boxes and outfits and never went back?

Just kidding. I've switched to Herbivore so no more Brahmin for me.

damn bro this really useful, thanks

It's working now.  Thanks for all your help.

I like my magic quad shotgun. I can one shot small mobs, and I like my game experience this way. If I'm lvl 200, I SHOULD be one shotting everything that isn't beefy as I bound across the wasteland.

Nice pics, I'm going insane trying to find a server with someone going through a silo already XD I finally found one but I didnt realize you couldnt be right next to the hatch. Then I found another one and I found out that the opening animation has a pretty short render distance :(
---
 I've had enough of these corksuckers and their stupid prizes

lmao. I'm on xbox w 24 machines not even locked.
---
What platform are you on? I'm on xbox and haven't seen any issues
---
Thank you! It sucks a little bit, really, because we should be able to tank rad damage by sacrificing other aspects.
---
It was this week for me, too, OP. I haven’t put in near as many hours as you, but it really is painful to feel limited by a game you naturally love and want to invest yourself into.
---
It’s a damn shame!
---
No please let them stream let them scream
---
Most people with bounties are players with OP gear or hackers looking for farm other players.
---
Used to be they would just be the bait while their teammates lie in wait, but thankfully Bethesda removed the ability for you to flag teammates for PvP (I believe).
---
Strange, I don’t recall gushing my love of New Vegas in my comment. I played Outer Worlds, didn't finish it because I found it intriguing but boring. I didn't run in to any major bugs during my time, just didn't really like it. Haven't played many other Obsidian games to compare it to. 
---
Ultimately, whether Obsidian is competent as a dev or is immaterial. Bethesda's responsibility as the publisher to ensure their products and those they contract out are in the best working shape they possibly can be. So yes, it is Bethesda's fault and responsibility, no matter who they contract out.
---
My favorite thing is when the game DOES manage to fast travel correctly, but drops me off in a completely different area then what I picked.  
---
I get so much exploring done that I never asked for!
---
likely they are all friends and don't want a random.
---
i know everyone is complaining about the Nw challenges but i just want the buying hand selling one to end, i’m tired of wasting caps just because nobody wants to buy from me, i’m also one of those people who don’t have millions of caps laying around, so i would like that challenge gone
---
They updated the game and in return still ended up with a broken game, makes me laugh thinking about it.
---
Found the Enclave agent 🙃
---
Ah. I did play nuclear winter. 
---
Its pretty annoying when you're using the foundation trader. Even more so when your diseases as well.
---
Anecdotal evidence only. 
---
My main is level 309, so I decided to cash in the 8k steel on my secondary (level 120 something). That character knew every plan I got. Transferred them to my first mule, who also knew them, then to my secondary mule, who knew half of them. 
---
So at least a small sample of them are things I have come across at least three times already since the game came out.
---
Oh I thought there was like an award or something for doing it that's exclusive to the the event but lol I won't now.
---
I have only been playing since January, and I am already burned out.  I love gathering and crafting in games like this, but even that has not been as much fun lately.  Of course, I have played long enough to get all of the Xbox Achievements, so at least I have those done, if I decide to leave.  My main is level 170-something, my first mule is 70-something, and my second mule is level 50.  
---
I have not played for the past few days, because I figured I would take a break for a bit, then maybe I would feel like getting back into it.  However, I have still been debating maybe just cancelling my FO 1st subscription and uninstalling the game from my console.  I had a lot of fun with the game for a while, but I am not sure if I will be getting back into it.
---
Offline/crashed players keep their slot on the team
---
I saw people that had them in their camp, how they get it?
---
Yeah, only way to do that is with power armor or hazmat/stealth suit. But hey, that's what Radaway is for :P
---
Three times by three separate people this morning xD
---
I noticed that myself, I will join near full teams to be able to teleport around and check out vending machines or hop on and join public events. With that said, I think the issue is that the game *thinks* the team is still full. This is because the last member to leave hasn't fully registered with the server. I have noticed this myself in a team when a member leaves and a good 2-3 minutes later, the message saying they left or got *"kicked"* finally pops up. This can also apply if the member disconnects or goes offline too.
---
***Todd Howard: "It just works"***
---
Xbox for me
---
If you join public events (not sure about the other kind), you don't even lose your junk.  It's still a risk, things go wrong, but it's no common unless you die just after the event ends.  Plus, it's free travel to join them...though that can get you into areas that are too high.  But no matter, fast travel home and you're all set.
---
I *really* wish people hadn't even started this crap "event"... :/
---
A bad camp is a floating building, nothing but water purifiers, or some other type of build that looks like it was inspired by a fever dream.
---
Shacks, tents, or even just a literal campsite can be good camps.
---
I don't care if I come across a zero effort camp, maybe except for when it steals my spot, but I always appreciate a well designed one.
---
Sorry to here that mate! I hope Bethesda give our console friends a reasonable solution.
---
Ohhh okay well yeah that was one good way to get it but that event is more of a yearly thing so you’ll have to wait till next year sadly :/
---
Yearly meaning once a year in case I made it a little confusing
---
uny at most can give 15 special points. That’s 5 blocks at 30% assuming you’re not running, jumping, or power attacking. And then you’re stuck once it’s drained you. And like I’ve said, anyone can use the perk. There are better ways to increase the efficiency of AP than just increasing your special points.
---
Seems like this started out with a long list of reasons why bloodied is OP, now it’s just looking for bits and pieces to keep this going... Bethesda doesn’t see a problem with current bloodieds and most players on reddit have been against nerfing them, so arguing semantics isn’t going to change the current system.
---
That's almost always because there's a mob somewhere just at the edge of your aggro 'circle'.  Usually moving a bit will fix that (or aggro whatever is close).
---
That happens when people who leave the team don't properly click leave group, but instead alt+f4 etc, or their game crashed.. There is a small time period where the game waits for the person who left to see if they log back in. You see this when your game crashes and log back in. You will be able to continue with same team.
---
You can cool it with the passive aggressiveness there bud.  
---
I play solo on the regular and don't have a problem reaching the end of the match with the glory that are my explosive weapons. Even so, Nuclear Winter *is* about the rewards for many newcomers. Stuff like the Gladiator Mask, Ronin Helmet and Hellfire Power Armor are the PINNACLE in PvP representation. I was just pointing out that the whole mode itself is heavily skewed in waiting for the match to progress, as opposed to bum-rushing and getting knocked before the the first circle even starts.
---
I love that feature. It has always worked too.
---
What exactly could they have made a trailer for? The countless (launch day) bugs that (still) exist?
---
Well I'm gonna go over here, knock on some wood and ask Todd to fix it then
---
No I got u 
---
Should have when it was available
---
I only get upset when they use a hacked .50 cal go do it.
---
I’m thinking it’s the same time Dailies reset
---
Its called passion. And your whole post lacks it btw.
---
&gt;Its hard work ~~fixing~~..breaking the game with every new update! They need to keep outdoing themselves.
---
Please read the description of Dodgy. I'll wait. And I've no idea what you meant by that "...tanks can use agility comment". 
---
I think you're confusing me with someone else. I didn't say tanks can't use stealth. Although now that you bring it up, I would argue that no, they can't. A TANK is someone who is DELIBERATELY grabbing attention to keep his allies from being attacked. Being a tank*y* character is different than being a *tank*
---
Bloody builds get 15 extra agility from Unyielding. Agility gives higher stealth (which is a form of DEFENSE; note I did not say "taking damage"- the best defense is never even being attacked) as well as extra AP to fuel Dodgy. And because most AP regen effects are % base, that massive AP pool depletes far slower but regenerates just as fast as a non-Unyielding build, making it far more effective at keeping dodgy active while also not being totally AP starved.
---
I'm still not over here trying to claim that Bloody builds make the best *tanks*. I've got a full health Junkie's unarmed build designed specifically to get in the face of the big baddies like the Imposter and Arkatos Alphas and survive there. 
---
But the things I pointed out are defensive advantages that B/Unyielding builds have. That's exactly what I stated, and that's all that I stated.
---
They needed to adjust some of the new wastelanders quests specifically Daguarres mission for a new sensor and some misc ally ones.
---
Now you know where they are though right?  Sneak and use cover the next time you are in that area.
---
It’s called *public* teams for a reason...
---
Yeah, for me it usually happens when they trigger one of their random comments while I am talking to them. Screws up or delays the conversation.
---
Good post and I’m glad that Bethesda has seen and relied but it’s just talk. We’ve been begging and begging for a scrip limit increase since pretty much it was introduced to the game. Same with everything else.
---
Gotta love your optimism ;-)
---
Fertilizer collector plans. You may need brahmin pen plan as well
---
Aint too much a worry for me. It's happened before and i just give it another try or two and whatev. Need to watch this stream (cant rn at work) tho cuz reading abt it in the comments sounds amazing haha
---
Oh this was super handy for me. Thank you. I didn't know what else we were asked to donate. Bookmarking this for sure. (Also glad to know all 3k pieces of steal I donated today were needed 😂😂😂)
---
Sounds shady asf.
---
The amount of wrong inputs I get on a typical play session is nuts. Sometimes it's just me dumb thumbing the keys, but often times it's the game being a laggy buggy bitch, or having confusing controls/UI. I play on a buddy's private server so I don't generally have to worry about inadvertent wanted levels(Any action that would otherwise generate one is kosher because we're teamed up), but I could easily see these issues causing one if I were on a public server.
---
Most likely way it'd happen is if I happened to be in a firefight near their camp or captured workshop and the game lags while I'm trying to hose a horde of scorched or ferals down with my M2 Browning. I've already accidentally aggro'd the Whitespring grounds patrols that way at least once. Game lags out(FPS not network lag) --&gt; I have no control over where the bullets go nor whether they're fired or not --&gt; bullet strikes unintended target --&gt; there ya go. 
---
One stray bullet from an M2 Browning bouncing off someone's turret due to my PC choking on the game while I'm in a big clusterfuck firefight(which with this latest update is so constant the game's basically unplayable) and now I've got a bounty that I didn't want.
---
Ya, I knew about some of those but I usually use the 1 I posted because its easy to get to (some of those others you have to walk for a bit and/or go inside a building to find the mobs but the one i posted the mob should be right outside). Plus, there are things I can jump on and snipe the mobs down from safety where I go (some of the spots listed do not have anything like that). Also, some of those places are near Scorchbeast sites which are areas I tend to avoid at all costs lol (especially while on pug servers where some rando could have agroed the mob to you).
---
You are more likely to get lemonade than coffee in FO76 and the lemons are just acid from insects.
---
I took me an hour on both my mules to reach possum and buy the backpack.
---
They're probably infertile by now.
---
Yeah but in a similar way GTAV was/is great for roaming &amp; doing what you want. At its core it is also a great game. Just the ways they are trying to extend play is less than desirable.
---
Between crazy work this summer &amp; also that burnt out feels I have come &amp; gone with 76, and I can't necessarily say it even excels at what it is, but there is something about it that is enjoyable walking around testing a character &amp; frankly blasting mutants in the face. Same goes for GTA I had the most fun just free roaming &amp; getting into shenanigans.
---
That said my interest in 76 was more recently revived, it had been months since I played it (COD:MW &amp; revisiting Diablo 2 were more appealing) but I'm like, I dunno, slightly enamored with it again /shrug
---
Sounds like a break is in order, test the waters again after eh
---
Yeah with all the smoke fx you can't really see anything when you're right up next to one during launch.  Best to keep a distance away for a good view.
---
FURIOUS cookies
---
This right here is facts
---
You can always post it on the reddit market, every time I post a sale it clears my vendor
---
As long as you're a little careful about the mods you install, there's very little chance of getting in trouble.
---
I've got a mod for perk card loadouts, which I'm not at all worried about.  I've seen a few mods that highlight certain items in the game, those are a *little* more touchy.  Making your death bag more visible seems fine, making bobbleheads or cap stashes more visible is kind of skirting a line.
---
If you find a mod that lets you fly and one shot mobs and create your own legendary items on the fly...yeah, stay away from that.  Though, I've never seen anything like that, so I doubt you'll see that.
---
HUD, item sorting, things like that are pretty safe. Higher res graphics would be fine too, but honestly I think that would kill your frames, but wouldn't get you into trouble.
---
I would actually kill for a vampiric attack speed rolling pin.
---
Also, on PS4, it's an achievement.
---
Then what is your problem.
---
&gt;but they are having trouble just implementing a new event, and we know that has been a colossal problem for them
---
i see what you did there, nice  
---
but i agree, it would just have to be whatever system they are using for camps. coming from other games, that shouldnt be an issue at all, but i have no idea why they have been struggling so hard to put even the most basic things, so i fear you may be right about their ability to put it in without breaking 20 other things
---
It is on XB as well. I think I still have 60 or so to go.
---
I drank 5 in one go... Bad idea... Woke up in watoga surounded by asaultrons
---
There's a sub for trading that sounds like Barkette + 76.
---
Screw those corksuckers. It's more of a hassle throwing away all those shitty floater grenades.
---
Yeah, this was also equally disappointing.
---
They've cornered the market on casual bugs, annoying bugs, and game-breaking bugs, it's not surprising that they've branched out into more niche markets like other people's humor.
---
I'd almost advocate for the opposite solution. Hacker *ONLY* lobbies. 
---
If you get a person that somehow gets dozens of reports after a single match, imagine if they got stuck only queuing up with other hackers in a "bad guy" style lobby. And they'd only be able to match up with other people with report histories like that until Bethesda could get around to reviewing their account and the evidenced against them. At that point they'd either be reintroduced to the regular lobbies (if for some ungodly reason that dozens of players reported an innocent person after a match), or preferably the account would be banned for hacking.
---
Wait, you can travel from nuke zone now? I remember you was not able to travel inside nuke or out, used to run away from the zone or get inside whiesprings building for example, or glass caverns. I came back not so long ago, maybe changed 🤔
---
Park it heavenly hicks?
---
The PA skins bug me. I wish they separated them into "Shape" and "Paint" so they could be mixed and matched. If I could paint the Hellfire a different color, I'd be MUCH more inclined to grind NW to level 100.
---
Somebody get this guy a puppers
---
Yeah this is why I'm thinking of switching back to PC. I love playing on my Xbox (my couch is 10x more comfy than my desk chair) but the experience isn't the same.
---
Holy shit. I would watch Tom &amp; Jerry from my CAMP all night long
---
Got the daily challenges complete bug today. I am two squares away from the other ship.
---
I noticed a lot more people using crafted legendaries lately. My sales have also dwindled since the last update.
---
Yep ive lost several items while transferring on private
---
Cosmetics could apply to NW.
---
I would appreciate it
---
Yes, I scripped a bss 2 handed weapon. It was heavy.
---
Stable flux and repair kits worth it for sure
---
Been having tons of issues since the update. Favorite is the slow walk after fast traveling. Like your overloaded and hungry and thirsty.
---
Equip scrapper, run through any area with scorched or mutants and you'll have like 500+ steel in 20 min.
---
No, they brought in some of the main devs and then put them in charge of it. So they are the main driving force behind what the 2.0 update will be.
---
Uncommon were super common cause the event was very popular and we got an extra week due to bug causing the start date to be pushed back. 
---
TBH probably not worth much at all. Maybe at most like 100 caps for uncommons.
---
I get better items doing the treasure hunt maps than I got with those Atlas boxes.
---
It's nice that they know the game is horribly imbalanced.  Less nice that they clearly give fews shits about it.
---
The combo steel/ copper location. Two resources and a great view to boot!
---
Bloodied pipe bolt rifle or revolver not bad tbh, because it works with rifle and pistol perks at the same time. So it might worth 1500
---
Because we’re in a phase where it’s acceptable to act petulant at the moment.
---
You keep saying that but the problem myself and evrryone else has for the most part is that we use explosive shotguns blast radius to cripple targets for easy clean up of groups. Sooo its a huge problem and Bethesda are still asshats!
---
Schools, universities the vault classrooms and orientation rooms.
---
That people cant deal with losing a few rads.
---
I need two different ones? Are those to trade with gold or something? Sorry I ask too much

---
This is kind of what I run on my Commando alt with situational perks added.  Nice thing about Junkies is you don't have to worry about specific perks for it to work, just go for best damage.  Get the Chemist backpack too.
---
Damn that’s amazing I wish I had someone to help me when I started actually I could still use help now (level 42) I have no stimpacks or radaway
---
Crafted legendaries? What’s this you speak of.. can this really be a thing? Please explain..
---
The whole point of an RPG with a custom points/perk/skill system is to test the players skill in finding combinations that work well. A build system where you can't make a bad build would be a detriment to a game like this. Not every build is supposed to be good. The game does need balancing though, because the players should be able to base a good build around every one of the primary legendary effects (with the enemy specific effects lumped together with each other as weapons for a "specialists" build) and that's currently not the case.
---
If you post up your perk loadout, mutations, and armor/weapons loadout maybe we could help you find what the problem is though.
---
When I was lower level I think I shot down someone’s nuke card and I looted the vertibot and became wanted. Later stepped outside my camp and was one shotted from super far away. At the time was at the base of the monorail tower outside Lucky Hole mine. They were at the very top of the broken monorail track. Was just really impressed and also understood immediately. Like bravo, sir and thank you for removing wanted for me. You earned those 5 caps.
---
Not legit. Tenderizer can't roll as legendary.
---
Blooded is actually no risk/high reward considering there's no penalty for dying.
---
Shotguns, if used with blocking effect armor, have a magic effect on them. They can rip through basically anything in the game right now. That being said, there's no telling how long until they 'fix' it
---
Certainly don’t want to clear my vendors.. I’ve got like 600k in them..
---
That's what I was thinking. Seemed a little too good haha. Never seen a legendary tenderizer either. Thanks mate
---
Fisto wants to know your location
---
Yep for sure this combined with the perk with a chance to refill your clip in luck also work very well
---
Honestly I think it has something to do with having large amounts of Carry Capacity.  I never had a Fast Travel bug the whole time I was leveling these past few months, but now that I have Unyielding gear and my Carry Weight reaches like, 436 on a good day, I'm constantly getting the Fast Travel Bug.
---
I have noticed that apparently running a little bit away from where you first try it seems to make it work again, but it's not always the case.  May indicate something to do with worldspace cells.
---
Jesus this sounds gruesome
---
I’m guessing that it wasn’t ready for a console release
---
People making gauss stuff and their own SS I assume
---
I dont know I have 2k+ hrs and 100k+ steel and I wouldnt give them a used stimpack for this shit event or their shit rewards.
---
What's not to understand?  He doesn't want it to be true, so he'll ignore all evidence and pretend it's not.  Sadly this is not a rare quality in people anymore.
---
But they do ENCOURAGE it.  Which makes people feel like thats what they SHOULD be doing.  Even if they don't want to, even if they don't do it, the game is telling them they should.  It's intentional, and it's lame.
---
Because people are canceling 1st over the camp changes
---
If you dont have DeathClaw Raven Crazy Man then theyre worth very little
---
Old Man Winter was rare but slightly more common
---
Other than Owl...the masks are worthless unless youre selling to people who never did fashnact
---
Have you quit and completely restarted?
---
Concrete you mean
---
By this logic everything is legit.
---
I think this is referring to the secret service armor, gauss shotgun, and other weapons that are crafted using legendary modules
---
One simple solution that would make the score system 100% better:  All daily challenges EXCEPT the "do 5 challenges today" expire in 72 hours rather than 24.  That way people who have lives can play 3-4 times a week and get most of the points while no lifers still get a bonus for playing every day.
---
Appreciate the help man, but please specify how much I should sell the owl for?
---
Fastest way for me was to just capture workshops over and over again.  You get a silly amount of exp for such a simple task, and at low levels it'll boost you up in no time.  You can also stick around to do the defend event that occurs a few minutes after you capture one.
---
Just be sure to stash your junk and be mindful that anyone who shows up at your workshop could be an a-hole looking to contest it and one shot you.
---
Bloodied railway, fixer, handmade or 2h melee, they worth more than that
---
I have my camp in the same spot.  I love that location.  Though I have a few other spots scouted for possible relocation at some point.
---
Wait whats the difference with the owl mask? I knew deathclaw and raven were pretty rare drops but is the owl?
---
tbf that doesnt matter...if im on a build team w my 3 friends, one crashes and someone else joins and makes it full
---
were going to kick the random and let our friend join
---
Don’t worry, it doesn’t matter that they haven’t fixed the fast travel bug cuz they fixed the photo frame which displayed a vault boy with a lazer musket to an AR. We have balance
---
We were discussing this in-game. It does still work but only seems to proc about 1/10th of the time. Radiation Rumble was our measuring rod &amp; whereas before there'd be a ton of ghouls crawling around, we had literally around 3 crawlers the whole event.
---
Maybe Bethesda's anti-fun detector took umbrage with it.
---
I personally haven’t tried them, but I was at the sbq event and she died in 30 seconds or less from someone using that.  I wasn’t very happy, but I lived with it.
---
 What stream?
---
You must be new to Fallout, they didn't even bother with interior maps as the previous ones were useless. It's just nice to have a map. Here at camp Bethesda we know not to ask the normal amount.
---
I would LOVE IT if they remove item levels. I've got a few legacy weapons but they're all sub-50. I love my TSE Handmade, but hate that it's forever level 35.
---
It probably belonged to that woman he killed (sometimes the corpse of a woman is spawn in the bedroom where he sleeps)
---
idk. its up to you...its not worth more than a few hundred caps. I have 3 myself but dropped 10x that.
---
Owl is the best of the non rares
---
No. I'm level 262. I spend most of my time building bases.
---
Fallen Earth.
---
Ive got t51 plan from it, donated like 5k, have no fo1st so no need to store that steel (not giving away my plastic tho)
---
Alright then, thank you!
---
Where are you on the map?
---
I'm desperate to find one aswell.
---
Owl was a semi-rare common. Also i personally love it more than the other masks
---
So tier wise...rares... then owl
---
Well I'm an idiot. Thank you.
---
Not FO76, just Fallout in general. Previous maps were a joke. Believe it or not this is a step up.
---
I got alcohol!
---
I consider that 'good' because it got me drunk and made me forget that I donated steel at the observatory.
---
You'll learn to love that sound when crafting.
---
Yeah maybe so but if it yook them 2yrs to start playing do you really think their the important clients or those of us with thousands of hours who have had all these plans for months?
---
Oh I know. Loved the pretty fo4 maps. Totally didnt get confused
---
I get it constantly on all my characters and some of them have very low carry capacity because they're non legendary no mutations builds. 
---
I think it's related entirely to stealth and enemy detection problems. The bug was introduced when they got rid of the "you can't fast travel near enemies" message and changed to the countdown timer that lets you fast travel if you stay undetected. The countdown stops if you enter combat, so I think what's happening is the server is detecting you are in combat when you're not. I just don't think they know why or how to fix it.
---
You just need the fertilizer plan.
---
That would be a good choice if the servers weren't taken offline last year.
---
Hey man. I too am at almost 2000 hours. (1807 to be exact). I have played nothing but 76 for the last two years. But? I still love the game. Yes. I beat the game. Yes, I’ve hit ally with both factions, yes, I have my god roll armor and weapons. But...? I’m still here. And will be until this game is over. And I mean over and done. Fallout is the sh*t. I love this game. And I will keep playing until something similar takes its spot.
---
On the cliff right of white spring..
---
It might be, I’m not sure. All I remember is that when I crouch walked when aiming and overruncumbered in third person it consumed Ap while if the exact same thing happened in first person ap would slowly trickle back. I was in power armor btw
---
Well that's not the reason.
---
Nothing new.
---
Almost everything in the atx store is either recycled from fo4 or its creation club, which is fanmade content. Captain cosmos power armor etc all came this way.
---
Eh, no mans sky is pretty close but it is still pretty unique, I can tell you this, their devs are 10x better than Fuckthesda
---
Nah. I want to play the game casually without worrying about starving.
---
I was unaware of that until I googled it after.
---
Can't you just buy some ammo from someone? Find a vendor selling ammo for a cap each and buy 3 bullets.
---
I actually find it hilarious when i'm trying to jump over a pile of corpses and end up just dive bombing my face into unknown proteins, it looks so dinky but I always chuckle~
---
Um.. k?
---
If it is an accident that is one thing and generally it isn’t A big deal and ofc you can gain the rads back. The problem isn’t losing rads. The problem is when people try to trick/troll/grief bloody build players into losing rads. And by your past comments you can’t seem to tell the difference.
---
[ T-pose inside bunk bed to assert dominance ]
---
Nope, there is a max speed cap which is hit having speed deamon active. No fixer or any other buff will increase movement speed beyond it.
---
i never get servers where people are selling bullets, i get the people who sell fasnaght berets for 5000 caps
---
Aye, I found a Hunters Ultracite Gatling and it was a game changer for me. Now my SBQ damage is actually noticeable, feels like I’m contributing.
---
Next step: find a balance between the legendary weight modifiers on my standard gear, and needing PA in a nuke zone. Last time I put on PA, I gained about 75lbs!
---
If you believe their "Polish" is going to leave it in a better state at this point your delusional. I expect issues to be found with the event within 24hrs if they wait till 2030 to release it. GET REAL!
---
Wow, whatta narc u r..
---
He's using a PA : adamantium is useless 
---
I'd suggest playing stealth without PA and get the full bonus from Unyelding tho
---
I was trying to figure out why you were not getting the traffic you want, being there is prime for people. That many weapons in itslef is an advertisement. I guess patience, or pricing is the answer, but what do I know?
---
The Brotherhood beret? I heard it will be available for free in the Atomic Shop August 11th
---
You should use one of the infinite weight suitcases that’s what I use... never had an issue
---
I usually message the person to see if they're ok with me killing them
---
My magic shotguns are awesome.
---
Lucky, I have never received anything over 2 star, and usually it is a 1 star.   
---
Have looted like 6 full sets of one star wooden armor.
---
You actually get stuff from them? The last 3 I’ve done I have gotten nothing.
---
What do you play on
---
My main is a medic frontline tank character and I've loved the support role more than any high damage I've played. The fire healing perk currently doesn't function with the flamer so you have to use the shishkebab when trying to work it. You will absolutely want speed demon mutation like what others say; the healing perks and abilities are all close range only for the most part so you need to close distance to weak team members. You can also role with Empath mutation making you take 25% more damage but all other members take 25% less. For a majority of healing abilities the healing effects only help people in your current team with the exception of Solar armor earned at endgame (Which I'm currently getting). My personal build has me using heavy weapons for long range combat, shotguns for crippling and medium range, melee for close range and my trusty bashing minigun for anything that I need to annihilate. I'm over level 200 and I honestly wouldn't play the game any other way since a vast majority of players only care about dealing damage.
---
I tried stashing ammo near vault 76 for new people to find. The bag disappeared every time.
---
This event should have been out by their own word to us over a month ago. So do people get pissed when a company doesnt stick to its word? Yes! (And this is not a one off issue. They never stick to their word.)
---
Played mad max the other day and boy, I sadly wished they had the rights of fallout. 
---
If you are up to more fistfighting instead of shooting (hard to get a post apocalypse setting with shooter aspects since, you know, post apocalypse and stuff) give mad max a try!
---
Did you bang her?
---
I think it could be that players feel it might be a trap or something? When I was rocking 70ish weapons I was doing business hand over fist, so I expanded.. But since it says 90-95, barely anyone shows up.. My shit ain’t cheap.. But it’s certainly fairly priced..
---
Snitches get stitches
---
Guessing is no fact. Check the wiki yourself, all datas are available.
---
PC? I’ll spend more caps traveling than the bounty is worth to gun down a wanted player.
---
If I did, would it shut her up?
---
I mean who could resist with a face like that.
---
Magic heavies are insanely overpowered and should honestly be fixed.  At least mine were however it’s better to stack magic damage with a good build.  Bloodied or Junkies preferably.  Even then some are more consistent than others as it’s based on your weapons DPS and your FPS.  Results may vary.  My Advice...You want a Minigun or a LMG.  preferably with Limb Damage or 33 vats or bash damage,  I believe their may be one more but those weapons are completely broken.  The B LD mini I just traded was the most broken thing I ever owned,  Soloing SBQ out of stealth was never so easy and fun.
---
Xbox1
---
Many times. Never woks for Ward.
---
Saint... saint?!
---
Has anyone else been able to claim the beret or are they making us wait till the reset before we can collect it?
---
That sucks.  In the map, if you hover over the camp, it should tell you what type of items are being sold.  That can help eliminate the camps that don't sell ammo.  It doesn't guarantee that they'll be sold for cheap, but it should help narrow down your search.
---
Didnt Bethesda say they wanted to create a online Fallout? What did they think games as a service consist of? Months without content?
---
I've had Ward glitch on me a few times and I had to back out of the game completely and wait a few minutes before starting it back up. He also goes still goes to bed in his trailer in the middle of the day occasionally even though this was supposed to be fixed. Ward has always been pretty glitchy in my personal experience. The rare junk exploit still works with him too. It's not always possible to do it multiple times in a day, but it always works for me when the Vital Equipment quest is initiated when I do my dailies.
---
Thankfully there's pretty much always a survival tent at the nuke zone so you can just pick up your laser from there after mapping.
---
yeah i do that but all of them are way too overpriced
---
I've had this issue since I started playing a little after wastelanders dropped.  Its bad after fast travel but it's worse when you first log onto a server it seems to last longer in my experience.
---
She lasted 2 weeks at my camp.

I replaced her with Old Man “Pull my finger”.  He lasted about a week. 
---
I now have a small amount of sanity with Raider Punk.
---
Tell me about it,  how many times did we all look at the map and go “hey a hill in a cool spot! let’s build our base there.”  Goes there...  Looks nothing like the map,  build spot icon looks like the camp is below the hill....

Looks the author had enough of Bethesda, found this message on a cached version of the mod page here: [https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:O8NrM0R7RKQJ:https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/523%3Ftab%3Dfiles%26file\_id%3D3928+&amp;cd=5&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=au&amp;client=firefox-b-d](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:O8NrM0R7RKQJ:https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/523%3Ftab%3Dfiles%26file_id%3D3928+&amp;cd=5&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=au&amp;client=firefox-b-d)

&gt;**Hidden at 24 Jul 2020, 5:09PM by** [**Sporko06**](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/4759821) for the following reason:   
---
*Bethesda's  ineptitude at stopping constant exploits and handing cheaters their  accounts back unscathed is the last straw for me. It's been fun? Sorry  to anybody who liked the mod but there are other great options  available.*
---
I guess then they went and deleted the mod and their account too.
---
And she's not earning herself a trip to smash-town with this type of behavior that's for sure, even if it is an option in game (which I'm unaware if it is).
---
Just... Why?
---
Right. Or hey there is a GIANT cliff I about aimlessly wandered off of.
---
Can you enlighten me on where to find this suitable replacement for her? I'm at my wit's end with her.
---
The reason bloodied is so strong is because so many perks and a mutation give bonuses for being 20% health which you can accomplish by dying to rads and then unyielding armour which makes all your stats so high it’s practically impossible to not perfectly do everything sure endurance would be low but that won’t matter when you’re doing so much damage everything instantly dies
---
A becket quest should guarentee it
---
I use those as well but the ice machine is just more convenient.  I honestly only lost stuff in it once in months of transfers because I was distracted talking to a friend that came over mid trade.  I mean I’ve transferred insane amounts of stuff through that ice machine.
---
So you understand the pain too then. At least I'm not alone.
---
I mean seems good then🤷🏻‍♂️
---
F
---
In all seriousness yeah thats not good,  hope that kinda stuff doesn’t happen when you put something in the stash next 😅
---
Melee one handers or two handers takes up too many strength points in bloodied. I found unarmed far more viable. just three to max unarmed dmg, then throw one in for extra swing speed while using a legendary unarmed like a bloodied gauntlet or mole miner claw with increased swing speed, then max out bloody mess in luck
---
Restart into new world
---
You should have analyze the blood sample and install the fuse for quest options
---
Use computer and analyze first
---
Install fuse after
---
Checkpoint
---
I like owl mask as well. I ended up with 6 of them after the event was over. Use them as decoration at my base mostly.
---
Psychobuff and Berry Mentats.
---
Yea thats why i was asking they was killing the sbq before i could shoot it
---
Caps. Collecter spawns the brahmin and the pen can contain it if you want. If it runs away store the collector and place it again it will respawn
---
Hell no. But you get tension release.
---
Couldn’t you do even more damage though by using bloodied cause low health perks let you do more damage
---
Id kinda like to try it to see what its like
---
How long do you have?
---
Where I live and with my connection, my latency to the game server was extremely low. 
---
However, I main a stealth sniper and this issue has plagued me since the game released.  It does diminish or almost vanish for short periods between patching, but always comes back.  
---
There is no better internet that I can actually have short of digging a fiber optic line directly to Beth's server...
---
So if it ends up being latency, it is happening on their end for most and client side only if the client has truly shit connection speed.  
---
Because it can definitely be both.
---
I love this game and will still play it no doubt, but I'm finding it so hard to get satisfaction when I've done everything there is to do. what do you do when you play?
---
Heavy gunner or commando
---
I heard it was good
---
See... I turned in about 30K more steel after I knew the quota was reached. On purpose.
---
You get 25-500 caps for each 250 steel. I could sell steel to other players for 1 cap per... but that takes effort and it's way easier to just cram it into a donation box.
---
I love getting those whining butthurt messages.   
---
"Wow, you must think you're a bada\*\* killing a level 37 when you're over 300."  They usually go on to "insult" me in a number of ways.   I think that's one of the funniest things in the game.    
---
However, if they take their killing like a champ, I am standing there to shower them with Stimpaks and such when they come get their stuff.  If they had tried to fight, I usually give them more.
---
yep, sold all my extras for 100 caps each
---
Ward gives zero fucks.
---
Do you run *barbarian (mispoke and wrote gladiator at first) on strength for just the raw dmg resistance? I have that and only rank 2 fireproof running an unyielding, and between max dodge and serendipity, explosions dont do jack to me. The floaters must have aoe tho, right? Cause it isnt the intial impact, it's the ticking away at health
---
Gotta use VATs for it to work on shotguns though.
---
Vampire too for non pvp.
---
I would imagine that it's a controlled environment they're streaming from, meaning they can script things ahead of time which they can't do with the live game.  The actual event itself for Live may still need some debugging or fiddling.
---
tl;dr prepared performance vs real-world interaction.
---
MIND BLOWN!
---
Like phbthhhh...
---
It finally started working for me. Idk if you've had any luck.
---
I just can't stand the old GameBryo engine it's on.  Kinda holding out for the F4NV mod.
---
Though that's still probably a decade away from completion.
---
Enforcer worked just fine for me this morning when I was playing.
---
I have tried it, but lacks the combat I'm looking for. It is an amazing game, it just doesn't fulfill my gaming desire.
---
While not a spreadsheet,  this should help. Plug in the attributes, and abbreviations will be at the bottom.
---
https://fed76.info/pricing/
---
The armor stays on your chassis, so if you deploy the chassis all your armor should be there
---
I use [fed76](https://fed76.info/pricing/) gives you the abbreviations and a rough idea of resell value for armor and weapons
---
I've been training for this event since FO3. **Start** hoarding?
---
They’ve added a new dlc called Desolate IIRC with freighters full of alien enemies, the combat can be a little iffy but it’s ok, at least it doesn’t bug out a lot
---
Ah, see you've gotta separate flame damage between the actual direct fire damage, and then "afterburn" which is the lingering DoT.  Asbestos probably only makes you immune from the afterburn, not flame damage itself.
---
Basically, if you've ever played TF2, it's like how Pyros can be burned by other Pyro's flamethrowers, but they wont ignite and burn for a few seconds after being hit by fire like every other class in the game.
---
that was the bug I found, it wasn’t there. I have a T-45 set that I’ve held onto since early game saved that way.
---
You can only sell 1400 caps to vendors per day, I hit that just selling the chems and other stuff I pick up every day. The only two things I did with steel before this was sell it to players for 1 cap per (which is sporadic at best) and making ammo.
---
I averaged about 271 caps per atlas box, which is a little better than what I was even selling steel for.
---
I got a instigating limb damage minigun from a players vendor for 1200caps, it shredders the queen within 5-10seconds once she landed. Tbh I only use it on private servers or if the event is below 10min timer. Also tested the gun on pts for the colossus, worked fine. No vats,  no stealth just a bloody heavy build. Enemy's must be in melee range tho.
---
You two were as thick as thieves.
---
Have you done the Mistress Of Mystery yet? The only part you'll struggle with is getting an item out of the Whitespring, but you should be able to rush in and rush out that part. You can get the quest by finding a body at the Tygart Water Treatment plant.
---
Your sarcasm is dripping onto the replies...  strangely it smells like mimosa.  Huh.
---
If it was simple and worked well, they wouldn't be able to sell us an upgraded version later
---
anyone else unable to select "major" traits on that
---
[edit: fml, messed up a reply to another post]
---
Yup I got wanted for basically the same thing and HATED it because I love visiting other people’s CAMPs. I went to Crater and approached the first person I found. He did not get it at all lol I had to send him an Xbox message saying “I’m wanting pls kill me.”
---
Thanks I've been wanting to trade some legendaries and I could never guess the abbreviations they put lol
---
Hey I need a good soul that can trade me the “calibrated shocks” for ultracite PA 😖
---
oh dude that would be super cool but i’m on Xbox. I really appreciate that offer though man
---
My proudest PVP moment was when I had just created a new character to try out a new roleplay build (Cowboy, baby! Though now he's more of a pirate quick-wheeling through black powder pistols...) and some level 80-something came sprinting up to me in Flatwoods and shooting me, a level 7. At first I just ignored him, but after about 20 minutes I started getting annoyed. So I looked at him while he continued to shoot me, readied my throwing knife, and fired 2 rounds from my revolver right as I let it go. Instant drop. Grabbed his junk and hopped servers.

We are closer to the cuticle not knowing what the fingernail is up to, then the finger, then the hand...

Shit be whack.

Fed76 "pricing" completely bogus, madeup and outdated. Go to any serious trading sub/discord with this and you will be laughed at.
---
IKR...
---
Poor deluded optimists, always remind me of happy, playful lost kittens.
---
I was also sad at the loss of PVP in adventure mode. I know the trolls were real, but it kept me on my toes. Everything is so much more car bear oriented now, very little challenge.
---
I can confirm this. Just tried to do it twice in a row.
---
EDIT: I can also confirm that doing the quest in a private server made it progress.
---
Definitely Mistress of Mystery if you haven't done it yet, that was probably my favorite side quest in the game. I also feel like at that level, the Ash Heap is a good area to explore. The Lying Lowe quest starts there in Lewisburg
---
I haven't actually! I'll definitely give that one a try, thank you!
---
I've had a lot of people doing that lately. I tend to take Sunshine Meadows just because it's familiar to me, and multiple times while runnning the Defend event I've had people run up behind me with a BE 50 Cal or something and just lay into me. Like, bro, I'll give up the workshop as soon as I get the challenge progress, no need to overkill me.
---
I use vampire's weapons for everything except for like hard to kill enemies. Vampire's is especially good after the life regen bug fix.
---
For shorthand it's fine to refer to low health builds as generally reserved for bloodied weapons, preferably. Hence the bloodied build. You get the most with a bloodied weapon, but if specced for a bloodied weapon and using a differrent weapon, you'll still crank out pretty good dps. To be more precise, you start from the general and get more specific. Unyielding bloodied unarmed pve build, for ex.
---
Thanks heaps, I've wandered a bit into the Ash Heap but got a bit freaked out tbh haha. I'll definitely be brave and venture that way.
---
*"What can I do to grief these people"* \- Report them. They will be the next generation of "i didn't do nothing wrong and i got banned" people.

All I can say is... Ouch F
---
Um...have you done fallout 3, 4, new Vegas. I mean those games combined accounting just the main stories is a pretty large amount of time. And that's just one playthrough each. Add in doing everything, discovering the whole map, changing builds, finding secrets. That's a whole lotta fallout. Even if you have to go back and play 3 it's almost cathartic to play now lol
---
Beth puts PA skin on atom store.
---
Skin makes you take more rads.

Beth fixes it.

Skin....

FFS, how many reports do they need that every other fucking skin does this?

"Did I ever tell you the definition of insanity?  It is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.  Did I ever tell you the definition of insanity?"
---
Keep stealing their ammo, sure you will get killed but as someone else here put it, 50 caps for like a thousand ammo ain’t bad, but yeah, I get you, it’s super annoying
---
There's one not far from the Nuka Cola factory
---
I knew something was up. My bloodied gauss rifle use to one shot scorchbeasts and doesn't anymore despite the damage numbers being slightly higher now.
---
You get them from the quest, a couple killed by wolves.
---
Be the change you want to see in the world. Be fun, my friend. And I shall be fun as well.
---
But the whole legendary system is to replace atom challenges. There would be no reason to add content when there is no background to let us all pay more in any way. You want atoms? Go buy them, times of "free" currency is over.
---
In which direction?
---
I'm at level 380, for me the big draw was the caps, which average out to 1 cap per piece turned in. I had so much steel I'd never be able to use it all though.
---
are we talking about the big bang?
---
Punch Line:
---
NVM, it's a feature!
---
Along the dried up river heading towards Posiden power plant
---
Or a bloodied pipe revolver rifle with stat investment in both gunslinger and rifleman if you wanna have all the options.
---
Like I said, I use it as a rough idea.
---
Generally 50% of the listed value is enough to sell items pretty regularly, and keep the caps coming in
---
Smurf vs Snork, go
---
I got a three star submachine gun from a feral ghoul outside an ag center. I was like, wtf?
---
I just used an ice machine to transfer a couple weapons, outfits, and about 4k rounds of .45 to my alt and it was fine. Sucks that you lost your stuff though.
---
he meant in the game
---
Platform? Restarted the game? Tested it in any other locations?
---
Seriously, you noticed a bug for once and yell for help instead of test some things out in the first place? Yes we all know this game code is more spaghetti then Eminem mom, but seriously if everyone would act like you the whole Internet gets flooded with shitty bugs that probably occur only once in a certain location.
---
Nah, I run zero mutations and I’ve started getting the fast travel bug only after this last patch
---
You need to find the Recipe though.
---
Ammosmith and Super Duper for Ammunition. 
---
Chemist and Super Duper for Stims and Drugs.
---
And F\*CK the BoS!!!! \\m/
---
I don't stealth all the time with my bloodied commando. Sometimes I just throw on evasive, serendipity, and run around with vampire's wepaons and my heavy gunner never stealths ever and is easier to stay alive as over the commando.
---
Hell instead of delaying this event twice and streaming themselves playing it they could have patched out some of the issues we saw present during the stream instead of promising us an event that wasnt ready.
---
Lol I’m down to 1 on 1 on my smurf
---
Same. I'm on a stealth shotgun build.
---
Seems like they fixed it. Ran smooth tonight
---
I’ve been debating whether I should get an Ammo machine. My friend has one and he says it’s really good but I heard that it sucks if you want to move your camp anytime...
---
Also, how do I get one?
---
The more characters you make, the faster you get the backpack. I run five characters at the same time, and last backpack took me, maybe, three hours on a Saturday.
---
My main is friendly with the raiders, doesn't have the Chinese stealth suit, etc. My alts have the suit but will probably never have the secret service armor, etc. 
---
My mules came to life, so, they know plans my main doesn't, wear better armor sometimes, etc.
---
Nuke them?
---
Tank killer
---
Enforcer at all levels has two effects: the first is to mod outgoing limb damage, and the second is to apply the spell Stagger. The other weapon perk cards also use outgoing limb damage as their effect. What is missing?
---
go to nukes dragons website and you can go through all the perks and work out what build you want.
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=1f433ff&amp;d=s00p02pg2ph2pp2pi2ek0eh2cu2ir2ar2an2ao0a51a04a30l71l12lt2lk2lu2lv0&amp;m=051c24f83
---
this is what I am using ATM and you can solo the sbq in a couple minutes.
---
There are always “wind” Brahmin. The nightkin will sell you some for half your caps.
---
or maybe another overlay or submenu on the map screen!
---
Can’t wait for fallout 76 2.
---
That too
---
Thank you so much!!!
---
yeah just what we need chinese stealth armor being the only viable stealth armor all because people are too stubborn and egotistical to try a bloodied build.
---
What perks does that include?
---
That's pretty high durability for something that is low durability.
---
Unless it just degrades faster.
---
to grief them? take the bullets, blast mine their generators, burn their crops, get bounty, get killed, do it again. 
---
Find a way to track their user name, appear on their server each tome.
---
Find their ip, then name and home address, order pizza, order all the pizzas. C.o.d. (cost-on-delivery, not call of duty) controversial magazine subscriptions with their name, but delivered their neighbor's address.
---
etc
---
The ammo machine from the raiders you unlock from ranking up with crater and purchasing it with gold. You can only have one. And you can’t build it for your friends. 
---
The ammo machine I was talking about in my post, is the ammo machine from the ammunition factory. Players have found a way to somehow build that machine in their camp. You aren’t supposed to be able to do that. But they found a way and can place multiple ones in your camp (if you invited them to a regular team instead of a public) those ammo machines can’t be deleted or stored. They take a lot of budget and they will forever be there.
---
I don't know all mods, but the ones I needed: powerful automatic, silencer, reflex sights... 2200 hours in and still need to learn over 10 mods.
---
Rifles ignore armor and have chance to stagger
---
Check out /r/fo76filthycasuals if you want somewhere more positive
---
ironically bloodied is the only build in the game that's actually designed well.
---
Yea i agree with u id use it on the sbq when we cant finish it
---
Looks pretty good! I’ll grind some levels and try and make a build that’s the same. What do you recommend for grinding levels?
---
I’ll check it out
---
THIS WORKED FUCK YES!
---
I was with you until the pizzas.  That's just dastardly.
---
Not really. All they did was fix a health regen bug with speed demon and health boosting food/perks, but that's not a nerf it was a pretty big bug that made no sense. It's easily counteracted with vampire's/medic's weapons.
---
Yes, I have 3 bungalows, a seedy shed, an alien saucer, and a red rocket garage all attached to one house that spans several floors built on the side of a cliff
---
Special 8?
---
Just report them for cheating and exploiting, a temp/ permban or even character wipe is a hell of alot better than a cheap repair bill when they have probably duped and exploited in the past to have thousands of materials ontop of ammo. Bethesda has been doing huge ban waves and I assure you they will be doing another after they patch the exploit.
---
So are they the same? Because if they are it sounds a lot better to just have one and not take all the budget. The one my friend has I think is the glitched one because he has multiple
---
This made me laugh so damn hard.
---
Bethesda specifically addressed this in the recent patch. They’ve now restricted him to his trailer, so unfortunately you won’t see him wandering Foundation clipping through shit like he used to.
---
Yea the small one that’s vertical is the one you buy with gold. You can only build one. The other ones are glitched.
---
You do get atoms if you kill enough.
---
West tek, abandoned big town and any event that pops. don't forget to sleep for rested bonus. this build needs full set of unyielding armour and bloodied rifle for full effect too. it has very nothing in the way of quality of life and is a max damage build. 
---
don't be afraid to change it up a bit to suit how you want to play, but if you have the damage perks there it will work.
---
Enforcer still work but the crippling chance process reduce like a lots. It take a whole round to cripple thing instead 2, 3 shot like before.
---
Edit : yes, explosion effect don’t have cripple effect like many patch ago. You can fact check at fallout 4 with explosion weapon for comparison.
---
Awesome that worked for me.
---
Thanks mate!
---
It's one of the better story based quest lines in the game!  Make sure you read all of the entries in the terminals if you like lore.
---
So basically the ones that rock, go figure. That sh#t is rough.
---
I leave behind a "You've been insulted" note from the Insult bot.
---
I  have destroyed those games, to death. Thousands of hours, and at the end of it all I still wish I could have played with a friend. If I have to hear Preston Garvey tell me another settlement needs my help I'll go insane. The companions drive me nuts, and constantly get in the way. I just want to play with someone who I know has my back, and isn't going to stand there like a fucking moron while I get pin-cushioned.
---
180 BoS boxes I have get to open. Its contents will surely weigh more than the box itself so I'm just waiting until the end to do one big inventory purge at the end.
---
should I avoid the glitched ones?
---
Is there some special way you have to use them for the magic effect?
---
And they came back like nothing even happened. They were just still talking.
---
I kinda feel like that’s escalating things a lot.
---
I think we can all agree they f*cked up.
---
Idk why you got down voted this is spot on
---
How do I get the armor and weapon?
---
Didn’t know that. It’s just something to do (and fairly rare these days)
---
It’s your preference. Like I said. You CAN’T delete any of them. You can’t store them or scrap them. If you move camps. They will not show up on your menu at all. However they will be invisible and still take up your budget. 
---
That means you’ll permanently have them on your current camp and never ever change locations again.
---
So what they say is true - there is honor among thieves.
---
Who cares!?
---
Please do not feed the machine. The only reason they are doing this is to take back all the Duped material we have accumulated. The PRESENTS(crates) without the good stuff from the real presents is a huge slap in the face and everyone should boycott this stupid ATLas event. 
---
It took me about 12 crates to realize that this is a huge waste of time and it’s literally just taking stuff I use and giving me back stuff I drop on the spot. 
---
Aka Garbage
---
So Have fun getting frustrated if your going to participate.
---
can be bought from players camps or rare drops from legendary enemies. I was 700 hours in before I got my bloodied handmade to drop.
---
It's collector fodder for the foreseeable future. No craft option nor level upgrade options for it.
---
Yup definitely avoiding Those. I have a terrible camp location right now and I don’t need my tall wood camp getting destroyed due to no budget
---
If there was a solid answer for that you would win Fallout. Hope for the best will RNG or trade with the community via social media.
---
Awe man, I once caught him sleeping sideway in his bed in the trailer. That was like the most normal glitch I've ever seen cause people actually do that irl.
---
I'm not seeing the Mod Outgoing Limb Damage effect under any ranks of the Enforcer perk (Form ID: 00322354, 00322355, 00322356), but the effect shows up under One Gun Army, etc. It's showing up for you?
---
Hope you both also reported that base owner for exploiting xD
---
I mean most people will only have a week or two to earn atoms so I dont see a downside really and it rewards daily logins we all know they love those.
---
I thought for sure this was going to be the black screen bug you get after fast traveling. Guess it’s the *other* fast travel bug.
---
Maybe I'm doing something wrong.  
---
That char tends to carry a lot of food and less chems so I'm shooting for the Cooler mod but EIGHT badges?
---
How is this not fixed yet....any other online game something this insane would not last a week. It's been 9 months or more here with this. This game feels like it's still in Alpha.
---
Very nice!
---
this is great! thank you. do you know if there’s anything like this for plans?
---
I've been golf ball and pipe gun hunting the past 4 days. Saved up enough to comfortably donate 1k cork, without really grinding out or farming it up. Im pretty happy with that in terms of a donation, ill make up for it by donating 2k plus in concrete (spent a week at a concrete resource node a few months back so i have plenty saved up).
---
You are welcome.  There isn’t anything in this game worth more than 100 caps.
---
A friend of mine had this issue earlier. She just kept dropping bags, and one eventually showed up.
---
I have one friend who likes Fallout as much as I do but hates it online. I've met some people through playing and that's it.  
---
I'm not 'butthurt'. I know enough about MMOs and 76 is one at it's core even with a limited player count.  
---
The normal Fallout games are quite long and on PC with mods.....have entertained me for years.  
---
All MMOs are a time sink.
---
Snitches get bitches.
---
That is my setup, also use Talons, twisted muscles mutations. No vats, only power attacks mixed with stealth. It's my hybrid tank/bloody build. Can switch between heavy weapons and melee for SBQ. Since I primarily run melee, save up ammo for SBQ.
---
Perhaps you should use the current [page](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/fallout1st) as a guide instead of the outdated 2019. 
---
Bethesda said almost immediately after FO 1st was launched that they would not be doing things that they originally planned, like discounts on atom purchases, etc. 
---
So I essence, they are doing what they said and according to the current page, are providing what they say.
---
Go to glassed cavern, or find a higher level you can leech off of
---
I wish that was me
---
Nope, it won't. The rewards are known for a week or more. Sure its individual if you think the rewards are cool, but... well take a look: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/601477315825762334/740316232838021201/unknown.png (guess we have to donate cloth?)
---
Also, it doesn't matter how much junk we're donating since the timer is static, it will raise for the same amount each hour. Someone on a data mine discord claimed he donated 100 million steel in the first few hours and nothing happened on the timer.
---
Yup. [See this screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/BAaKq34.png). It's on nukacrypt, too. I wonder what the difference is.
---
Did your 'parents' not teach you how to accept someone else's opinion? Probably not so that statement 100% applies to you.
---
I know it's just the time and grind to get it was made to be so time consuming. We don't hall have the same skills nor lots of free time.
---
It's not hard to find these weapons. For a time, I had some for sale in my vendor but nobody wanted them, so I scripped them as I needed the stash space.
---
Right now I have two magic UGLs, one is a Furious and one is an Executioner's. I've tried to test which one is best, but they both shred the queen in 30 seconds when she lands, so it's difficult to tell the difference.
---
Just pay it forward.
---
some pizza places also deliver pasta
---
Nope, all you need is high fire rate. I use a shredder attachment, and have to stay close like melee range. With less then 300 rounds the queen is dead by me solo.
---
It's Todd
---
No. I have 2 legit tenders though. No way it can be legendary unless they added it to preveyer in next meat week.
---
in-game griefing is just not good enough, it's 2020 after all
---
Almost everyone I'm at this event, me and my friend are the only ones to take pylons. Could be 20 players there, and I'm wondering if people just have no clue how the event works.
---
Nice work, really cool.
---
I've build various mazes for a while now, mostly with http://www.mazegenerator.net, starting with ones in workshops when my own camp was kinda permanent, then own my own camp when I finally decided to move.
---
Tried a bunch of different designs, doors everywhere like yours, but I though that slowed down things too much in larger mazes, but realized keeping the door frames help to cut down sight lines down long corridors. 
---
I tried multi level mazes, but realized it was too much of a hassle to change the maze, and one bigger maze was better than a couple of smaller stacked.
---
Tried using the powered doors so I could rewire to change the maze, but that took too much budget.
---
Used to decorate like yours, but again that takes up budget, vs a larger maze with all the same framing while boring to look at, actually makes it mazier in terms of not being able to recognize where you've been before as well.
---
Never put traps in mine though I likewise have mesh roof and floor, but that's intended to entice those people that may be thinking it's a trap camp to see it's clear.
---
So my current one: https://imgur.com/a/4RWWTFF , while a lot less interesting at a glance compared to yours, still provides a biggish maze like experience.
---
It has a reward room at the end with a vendor of free stuff - usually plans, and good bulk junk I have too much of, and any trash legendaries when I'm over scrip - and a pressure plate door to let out.
---
Frig guys I have the same problem, I am going to try the Gefoece thing, I already updated, it let me in the game but can't get past the mode choice page. Going to have to reinstall I guess, what a hassle
---
Ah, it could be because I'm using the public release of xEdit from [https://github.com/TES5Edit/TES5Edit/releases/](https://github.com/TES5Edit/TES5Edit/releases/). I see now there's an error in the Enforcer perk record, which is probably causing the effect entry to not show.
---
Well... This is embarrassing. I looked into the record after seeing posts mention Enforcer didn't seem to be working, and thought I found the culprit. I'm going to delete the post to avoid causing any more alarm.
---
How do we claim it now?
---
Westek was my go to for XP runs.  Don’t forget your easy XP buffs like always being in a building group, eating cranberry cobbler, and sleeping for that added 5% bonus.  Events like line in the sand are crazy XP!
---
If you are on Xbox, hit me up and I’ll gladly run with you: GenX4thewin
---
Gf just bought one and we found out they can’t be displayed. She was terrified of scrapping it by accident. I suggested that she puts it for sale for 30,000 caps. That way nobody would buy it. And it won’t be scrapped.
---

---
Also wondering this. Probably get it with mat reset
---
You on Xbox? I got all the plans that are in it for 20 caps except the rare ones for 100.
---
the page you linked said just lists current things, and says future things will be added, the original launch announcement said the camp/workshop things will be added in the future. they arent mutually exclusive
---
I've had a modded game since the beta and so far I've never had any issues outside of needing to disable them to play Nuclear Winter (for obvious reasons). Fun fact: the first mod I tried was to replace some of the weapon animations with animation replacers from Fallout 4, only to realize 76 uses an updated version of Havok rendering Fallout 4 animations 100% incompatible, even though most of them were seemingly directly ported. Almost two years later and I'm still disappointed I can't have a right handed Hunting Rifle.
---
I think you gotta scrap them
---
I use the chicken coop from the legendary run. Gives you 10 raw fertiliser at a time.
---
I've had it happen dozens of times where I'll put junk in my stash,  and have plenty of whatever scrap it is. But when I build or craft something, the junk is used before the scrap in my scrap box. It just makes no sense!
---
Someone finally taught him how chairs work and he's none too pleased about it.
---
I expect him to send us out to murder more innocent raiders in passive aggressive retribution.
---
Gotta admit, I’m nearing that point. Hit it before Wastelanders, stayed invested through a text RP server I run. 
---
And now, with the constant delay of content (which doesn’t surprise me) and the chore of score... It burns. 
---
Never even played the Vault Raid because of the glitchy buggy mess it was when I first tried it. I won’t be doing the BoS community event (because I don’t have 1st and don’t care about the small reward it gives), and I don’t think one quest for the Colossus will be enough to keep the in-game passion for long. 
---
Hopefully, the expedition things coming “this winter” will be enough to keep this game going for me.
---
You're*
---
Also, we hit the goal just fine for the week. Be mad and don't participate if don't want to.
---
The Imposter gets 1-shotted every time this event plays out correctly, I've noticed.
---
I've also noticed people shoot at it while it's still invulnerable. I don't want to assume stupidity, so instead I assume people keep shooting at it hoping someone else will take care of the pylons, so as soon as the shield goes down they at least get a hit on it (since they're already shooting at it anyways).
---
My husband and I absolutely love to drop gifts to new players. It’s one of our favorite things to do in the game! I love when new players stop by my camp wearing their little party hats and ask for help.
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=8888888&amp;d=ll0ls2lt2l20ib4ip2a72a04eh2ee2e60c62cm2cu1sw2s22sg1pq1pg0ph0pp2pi0&amp;wp=w6w8&amp;wm=1b2838-1g2536&amp;n=Boom
---
This is the best I could think of. It’s a power armor build focusing on using up all the explosives that weigh the stash down, as well as being able to be a tank and provide AOE suppression in difficult events like encryptid or scorched earth. It uses power armor, and ideally you’ll have an explosive auto rifle as well as a quad quad barrel missile launcher (Hopefully 25% speed too)with a stabilizer and targeting computer to have a semi auto SAM system
---
You want a different definition of insanity?  Screaming into the void and expecting someone to reply back.
---
Reddit is not an official or reliable means of reporting bugs.  If someone's first and only response to finding a bug is to run to reddit then it they care more about upvotes and shit talking than they actually care about the thing getting fixed.  They should not be relying on the idea that someone else might see their thread and actually report the bug to Bethesda through an official channel.
---
Want to know why this is a recurring bug?  Because they use templates for this shit.  Someone hasn't been repeatedly fucking up and making the same mistake over and over and over, someone fucked up once, fixed it and then forgot to apply that fix to all of the remaining PA sets they worked on.
---
Ahhh I’ll try that
---
Why the rolling pin is a valid weapon. It can have legendary effects unlike the drill.
---
(reports same player, over multiple weeks, for multiple cheats/exploits/things)
---
(i get a stern warning from Bethesda, and soft banned for "spam", other player goes on, untouched)
---
(walks into roomates room)
---
"Well i got banned, how many ammo converters do you have now?"
---
roommate laughs: "like 80 over 3 characters"
---
Okay, I'm back in!
---
This happened just now. Public team, 4 people including my SO (team lead) and I. We were trading in camp and the other two members were "removed" from the team one at a time. We looked at each other across the couch with the same WTH expression.
---
You're complaining about the event, not the players. The massive health drain from the pylons isn't worth the reward. Direct your attack at Bethesda.
---
That moment when going to a single player game with access to bug-fixing mods triggers people who complain about the lack of bug-fixing via mods *or* developers. 
---
Seriously, the front page has been full for a week with complaints. Let someone enjoy what they enjoy without getting offended by a choice that doesn't involve you. Especially after all the "vote with your wallet" talk going around.
---
Sentinel gear is pretty expensive, and that’s the biggest factor, imo.
---
Nope. Didn’t work. I’ll try the raw fertiliser route now
---
Jump into other people's events.
---
I think you’re better off submitting this in a cosplay page for better results.  
---
Sure this is a fallout page and I get why you posted here. But you’re better off in a cosplay page because I’m sure there are gamers in there as well.
---
You can to an event.
---
I have serendipity and it’s nowhere near as powerful as you make out for me...
---
I saw someone also post that crafting them does not require cork, so you could 76 alchemy steel to cork.
---
Fertile Soil gives fertilizer has a guaranteed reward, and this *does* count towards the score challenge. You just gotta repeat it enough times.
---
I can guarantee that this will never ever ever ever be addressed. If there were a prioritised list of all the bugs, which I honestly doubt *very* much at this point, this would be one of the very last. And even so, the closest you would get to a "fix" is the combination being disabled so they are no longer wearable together.  
---
Your best bet is to look for other hats, or change the paint on the mask to the second 'no paint' option (you can change it back at any time - the changes just aren't viewable in the workbench view). Either way, making it less visible is the best you can hope for.
---
Spam collect workshops and complete their events with berry mentos and a full events team for easy levels, got from 29 -36 in about 4 hours today using this method. Also don’t worry about dying. Depending on your build, it might be worthwhile to invest in a flaming chainsaw and excavator set and just run around killing stuff in high level areas due to lack of flame resistance, as well as not wasting any ammo
---
From everything I've read, don't even attempt building again until the next patch. A colossal problem indeed, at least they stated it right in the headline this time
---
I haven't been doing the main quests just because I know when I finish it I won't have much else to do. I finished wastelanders so I can get gold bullion, but I still haven't finished the main. Granted I started playing again earlier this year, and then stopped for a while right after fasnacht (I think I was tired from thinking I needed to log in every hour and couldn't do much in between) but I've been taking my sweet time because I know this is a common problem, and honestly I don't want to hit it.
---
I just figured out how to get to the point of launching nukes, but I haven't actually progressed the main quest that far
---
When I first met her, there were 3 of her around the same general area.  Like triplets.  All three allowed me to do the dialog to invite her to stay at the camp, but only one actually showed up.  Makes me wonder what happened to her two sisters.
---
Can confirm, removed healing factor once to test this out and after a few days I got the fast travel bug aswell. I also know what's the issue:
---
Regardless the pipboy Only shows health points without any digits, the game itself calculates with such. Fast travel will interrupt when the health points get updated, and with healing factor healing a complete 1.0 hp every tick the system prevents you from having more hp as you should have. As example,  a bloody player with healing factor has a total of 60hp, the pip boy shows 60/60 but in fact the system is at 59.X and the mutation is trying to fill up, healing you to 60.X hp. System says no since you would have more hp then possible, reset the hp back to 59.X and count this correction as damage which prevent the fast travel.
---
Taking damage, walk a few steps or consume/interact with something updates the server data and should fix it temporarily.
---
*pumped up kicks fades up*
---
All 7 special stats at 8, so no strength/ no weakness
---
Well Thats new, someone on Xbox! It’s currently quite late where I am right now but tomorrow morning I’ll make sure to add you!
---
edit: Added you via Xbox app (infurnofic1)
---
*big iron starts playing*
---
(BoS Paladin PA requires Paladin Cork, which is bulked cork and legendary modules)
---
maybe this is the way
---
[edit: cork]
---
Yea I've been a level 50ish since release, just haven't really played, wastelanders got me to come back but fashnaught seemed to be the only really different thing, everything else is recycled content.
---
Thanks a lot for the advice! I'll definitely look at getting that equipment into my arsenal..
---
only if they played the fasnacht music
---
That’s kinda funny tbh
---
i have a blooded build and i can tank the pylon just fine i do burn threw my stimpacks but i have 300 of them so i dont care tho if i get hit by the unholyness that is the laser from hell i die but what build doesn't
---
Im sure is coming, maybe with the One Wasteland or the BOS arrival we will see something announced, it wouldn't make sense to add it to the batch of games like Doom or ESO. When they can actually hold one of those stupid conferences were half the time the questions are awkward. It's going to be a "One More Thing" moment.
---
dailies should have been score related - obviously with less score being needed to complete the entire run to make it workable. 
---
weeklies then should have remained atom related.
---
How do you guys get them to spawn? I’ve been there 3 times and I don’t see a single death claw.
---
Trust me when I say despite the level cap being 20, the chainsaw is the most fun weapon in the game. Because of lacking flame resistance, everything gets melted within seconds of contact with the chainsaw
---
it's for scrapping, that's why it was made... to crush the hopes and dreams of everyone
---
Switching to a pvp game
---
(Todd face)
---
[edit: google "Todd Bethesda" and see the face]
---
I think I’ll get it for a bit. Until I get better. Ok I thought they could get into the stash box.
---
Thanks for the offer! I am not a fo1st player, so I don’t have access to private worlds, I believe.
---
I know you are right. Thing is its so easy. Its not hard to add a simple line of code to check if the hat, or any brimmed hat, is being worn and display an altered mask if true. This is an atomic shop hat and feels very sloppily done. I know there are bigger fish but other, sillier, things have been addressed. 
---
Or just give us a rebreather...that would work.
---
Good call. I might do just that and to hell with the helmet.
---
leech a building team
---
I’ve been having the same issue, but it’s a lot worse when your workshop is under attack from someone 3x your level and you’re a melee character...
---
It is indeed the sweetest sound when crafting stable flux and ultracite ammo.
---
Uff, but then disable leveling or achieving any rewards or challenges. Otherwise everyone would exploit it having 30 Pacifism players dancing the motorman dance while the public servers are dieing while hackers are fighting themself among these few idiots like me who try to enjoy this shitty mode.
---
Huh? Death claw island? You have to go near the nest, it’ll pop up.
---
My go-to is the power substation just north of Watoga though. If you can handle max level death claws anyway. It always has one as well (unless someone cleared it recently).
---
Legendary perks have a higher cost to switch around compared to a perk like Lone Wanderer; and theoretically should offer a much better advantage than Lone Wanderer does. Bethesda doesn't want to disincentivize grouping up in their multiplayer game *that* hard. Since the last PTS, there are still plenty of options if you don't want to pick Blood Sacrifice or Taking One For The Team.
---
I'm not a bloodied build and I can't remember the last time I farmed for mats... Or even looted a non legendary
---
Yeah some are very nice n helpful and some will  just come along and destroy your camp and take your loot drop when they kill you 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
 i will bitch when they kill the queen in about 30 seconds  so not a single person gets credit and this is coming from someone that uses the bloodied build it has to be nerfed
---
Technologically hygienic raiders
---
The queen is scorched so the increase is primarily on her. Why would u need an increase on scorched?  You’re one shotting everything scorched except the queen and SB right?
---
Easy bypass: premade partys. You are not the first one with this idea and other companies failed this solution already.
---
Make sure you sand it and prime it beforehand. Ideally use a spray paint / primer combo similar to your desired base colour
---
Rofl I understand. That assaultron took me 3 tries and I was 10 levels higher (it should be noted I am not good at video games). I was finally able to chop it to death with a sharp black diamond, which was creepily satisfying as it crawled on the floor threatening me.
---
I got an auto assault rifle prime receiver... I needed it so I guess it’s technically good
---
Yes, I was just wondering how much more damage ultracite rounds do compared to normal against the queen
---
Just WHY
---
I think this is our punishment from Todd, for asking for real NPCs.
---
I second the comment about raider punk. He talks at the same frequency but his dialogue is far less annoying
---
As the first comment to this thread, this was comforting to read as the wound was fresh.
---
Seeing as so many headwear cosmetics make female characters completely bald, "simple" has nothing to do with it. 
---
We are paying real money for it! They should ensure it works with every hairstyle and every wearable combination. Detecting clashes/overlaps of 3D models is not hard, so the only real effort comes into any possible redesigns and alterations, which should have been considered in the creation process by having layers and making the designs modular before flattening to create the finished product. It shows how half-assed they really are - even with their precious MTX cosmetics..
---
I’ll try going to that power station... not sure how well a level 35 is gonna do there. I go to the nest and the animation for a dirt pop up comes but I never see anything actually spawn.
---
I just got it today! And  it would be awesome to see like every level preceding 100 be like atoms, scrip, gold, caps ECT
---
It’s a slight increase but adds up in queen fights. Most will prime their fixer if the fight her a lot and run a handmade with normal ammo for everyday.
---
Confirm to just wait a few moments when getting the final confirmation text will work sometimes.
---
Im at the point that I simply just kill myself once I encounter this bug, works 100%.
---
Go to lucky hole mine for lead, algehenny for aluminum. Also check out the Charleston fire station for the weights, usually around 100-125 lead
---
I feel like if you would have a ton of ammo Generators you should give a portion of it for free
---
If you’re on Xbox I’m starting a new character soon so I can help you out - usually only takes me like 3-4 hours to get level 20 when I start a new character.
---
Yeah, I did that to a friend once.
---
I forgot that strangler power armor is actually good in pvp.
---
pumped up kids... name of your sex tape
---
Do it and see. If u don’t see much of a difference then change it back and sell the ammo 1 ultra for 2 normal. It will sell in seconds on the forums.
---
Oh weird, that would have been a good spot for you too, that one’s max 21ish. 
---
The substation theoretically should scale to your level, but... good luck! 
---
(If it’s a level 91 glowing death claw, you might want to run ;)
---
I hoard ammo like crazy. When I find newer players I drop them .38, .308, .45, and shotgun shells. BUT NOT MY 5.56! Unless they’re running with a handmade. Then I’ll hand some over. But don’t come to me with an assault rifle..... ok... you can have some too.
---
It was an obvious typo, and your comment is gross.
---
For sure. I get tons of plans I already know and I’ll just drop them. The only plans I keep are the rare ones, but I tend to just give them away too if people ask for them. It’s just a game, I’m not going to genuinely get rich off of it.
---
So... I can play alone to constantly win and get max rank fast?
---
Heavy non-explosive
---
Been running junkies for months, I don’t keep any chems just sell them so most of my perks are based on damage output or damage reduction.
---
I run a vanguards SS Armour and am really tanky. But I also have an unyielding set that I can use if my rads start to creep up that can give the best of both worlds at the expense of a bit of tankiness 
---
It’s a great alternative to bloodied, (I still have a bloodied character which dies 100x more than my Junkie Tank)
---
It's a waste on normal mobs, as it does the same amount of damage as hardened receiver / powerful automatic receiver. It's only useful for SBQ fights.
---
When I start getting that feeling I take a few days/weeks/months off. I did it for a month before Wastelanders, after nearly burning out on the PTS, and went to play FF7R and just chill with other genres.
---
That said even now I'm much more casual than I was back then, if only because I have nothing to really aim for.
---
The issue with the Legendary Run is that you can't do this because it requires daily engagement to keep up, no matter how small or large. It's going to burn a lot of people out I suspect.
---
To answer your question. Why it didn’t count as a legendary I have no idea. 
---
However, if you killed the scorchbeast queen and you didn’t get to loot her, it means YOU didn’t do enough damage to her. 
---
It was updated a long time ago that in order for you to be able to loot the queen you need to do 1,000 damage to her. If you don’t, you don’t get to loot her. 
---
This was done because a lot of people would travel to the event and just stand there or hide. Wouldn’t help out at all and still got the rewards by simply shooting one bullet at her. 
---
Now you absolutely have to do at east 1,000 on her. So the past 3 times you fought her, even if she died, it just means you didn’t do enough damage on her.
---
I first played when there was a free weekend to promote wastelanders and then started playing regularly in the past month once Xbox Game pass for PC added fallout 76 (felt like I had to add that point, and only for $1 for the first month then $5 after that). Because of that, I never played pre-wastlanders cause I heard it was a hollow let-down of a game. 
---
What was it like before they added NPC's? I heard the overseer was still in the game but that her story didn't go very far or something. Was she the only human NPC at the time? The rest just being vendor bots or something?
---
Agreed. Kinda sad really. There honestly is so much good in this game. The good just makes this silly stuff that much worse.
---
Why does this always get downvoted? It's true. What purpose was there to seasons besides removing free daily atoms?
---
Yep the same here and someone live streaming the other day had the same problem with this, looks like another bug added to the list of bugs introduced with patch 21.
---
I’d recommend a Tesla rifle for situations where you’re super close and are detected. Otherwise I’d suggest an instigating lever action with true modifications so you can still hit your target even if you exit vats without realizing
---
There are better locations for that, and they don't even require a nuke.
---
WestTek, Charleston DMV, Burrows, and possibly the fissure sites.
---
Yeah, there is nothing more to discuss, since you are unable to answare to a simple question: why do yo collect millions of scrips and hundreds of legendaries...
---
Lmao.. especially since it’s on game pass now.
---
It's under Agility, for some reason
---
I think he became kinda grumpy now that can't leave the trailer, he's comments sounds more moody now imo
---
11th.
---
Magic weaponry is just plain and simple bug abuse; of course people won't admit it because they just love power trips while they last. A power trip that of course will end leaving them with trash gear on fix and a desire for more power that just leads to more bug abusing in the future.
---
 Yes they work, yes it is bug abuse and yes they will melt anything in seconds but everyone will absolutely despise you for it.
---
The 11th in the atomic shop.
---
Yes this quest is bugged. As is the quest further down the wastelanders line. You can’t get into a cave you need to go in.
---
😭😭😭
---
Supposedly in the patch Tuesday they changed the priority of what is used for crafting,  so whole junk in the stash should be at the bottom of the list.  But yeah, it sucks you can't display jumbo fuzzies.
---
I shit you not when I say this. I was completing the daily "buy 3 items" SCORE challenge and fast traveled to a teammates base cause they had a ton of ammo (I ALWAYS need .45) and plans (hunting for metal armor). Get to the base only to realize they've built it on top of Seneca Rocks. I finally manage to find their store and start looking through everything only to realize it's full of nothing but .38 and mounted cat plans. I close store and turn around use the stash box in the other corner. Teammate is standing behind me waving.
---
Poof. 
---
Floor disappears. I fall to my death. Luckily I didn't lose any junk cause I wasn't on a scrap run at the time. But boy was my blood boiling for a good 10 minutes after that.
---
Hitting it while invisible tags it for drop. Or so I heard, haven’t tested it
---
Vintage Nukashine! Because if you’re going to trip, you’re going all the way!
---
Wait what?
---
Make sure to check to see how many characters were wiped on the next ban wave lol.
---
Glad you found the few good ones. Most of the high level players I find are the kind to see im on a terminal at my workshop (munitions factory) and decide to start the workshop take over and kill me before I can even know they started it. But if you happen to play on Xbox and see a guy named Nuicence running around, feel free to say hey
---
You dont use vats for the criticals?? I was just watching some of the stream and was surprised she took limb damage... I got ad. skeleton maxxed, but also two points in action boy for faster ap (lone wanderer has become obsolete to me). But yeah i got lucky with a bloody gat and use that till sbq lands, then sneak mode crits in lvl 50 chinese stealth armor up the wazoo, lol. I found the points spent for sneak is obsolete with full unyielding and high agility points, but still have a point for the sneak melee amplifier
---
Hmm... reopen a bank in the world of fallout for stashed items between characters 🤔
---
If you have the urge to fight old queen bee alone you will notice the difference. All the same it's fun to smoke the little ones in one shot.
---
That lady community manager experienced the fast travel bug.
---
Vampire?
---
have you heard of the unofficial patch?
---
they arent glass cannons they have a straight 50 percent  chance to ignore damage they can have 20 percent chance to ignore ranged damage 50 percent damage reduction to fire melee and explosives an extra 150 dr on top of there armor  they also have enough sneak to be able to hump the enemy without then even seeing them if anything a bloodied build is more of a tank then a full hp powerarmor build
---
I ran into this bug yesterday. I was able to work around it by server hopping, then Analyze the blood sample before putting in the fuse.
---
I tried server hopping before and analyzing after putting in the fuse twice, and it didn't work.
---
It's also possible that just server hopping more than once fixed it.
---

---
This way you can keep your power armor while making it useful when caught. I’d suggest a Targeting HUD, Stealth Boy integrated into the armor, as well as a flaming chainsaw as a backup.
---
You already have people whining it's too hard when you can complete with 5 minutes/day.
---
Do you have any idea how much goddamn whining there would be if they're missing out on atoms for not spending 20 hours a day grinding out the ranks in the first week?
---
Honestly gotta laugh at how bitchy this post is.
---
That's your best bet (BOS RR), but .50 is much easier to produce in my opinion, so make it a .50cal receiver.
---
What, wait?
---
Chinese stealth suit is a quest reward EVERYONE can aquire, no matter if they side with crater later on - just quest for both fractions till the "side with xxx" quest pops up for both.
---
Also, not only the raider have the gauss minigun, the settlers also provide a gauss shotgun. 
---
Please don't mix up facts and tell only half the stuff...
---
I always add a level 5 above them so a nice handmade or fixer. But as far as cheap BOS is the easiest.
---
this! apparently someone doesnt know how to mod a game to fix bugs. played new vegas with just the unofficial patch, never encountered a bug.
---
That would defeat their whole reason for creating seasons, which was to keep you logging in past the atom store daily, nerf your free atoms, and create an atoms sink on top of it all.  They don't care about dedicated players if they're not spending any money on subs or more atoms.  Just wait until the next season, when they'll likely remove atoms completely as rewards, like they alluded to before this one...
---
I did cancel it. I played FO76 form day 1. sticked to it. I might play in a few months to see what changed. but right now, I need some rest.

See not all BoS bad. " Rather than flee, the soldiers decided to continue manning their posts until the bitter end, trying to buy as much time for Appalachia as possible. "

Automatic railway and VATS.
---
thank you
---
Finish the quest line, it does add some more idle dialogues and she stops complaining about headaches (mostly)
---
Awesome. The flamer mod makes all the difference, wish I can get the plans.
---
What performance gains? I've seen a lot of lag while working on a large camp, since the patch came out.
---
Shotguns fits your desired description of play style. Mess around with a few different types, no VATs required, and definitely some good fun.
---
Some armor plan that I never was able to find (heavy robot legs, strudy raider legs, etc).
---
I will if they get wanted attacking me.

Yess, but im seeing less spawn
---
That's too bad considering the time and effort this person puts into the mod. Hopefully, he/she finds someone to take over. In the meanwhile, we should be ok re-generating the strings files from Kit's strings on each update. It's just that new items won't be in the conversion.
---
It does not specify what will be added like the original post so it is not the same. The OP was asking about specifics that were mentioned originally but were later dropped by Bethesda. 
---
The current mention of change is as follows:
---
We are always considering new ideas and may add additional benefits to the program. We will notify members when that happens. To keep the benefits fresh, we may also change or rotate the icons, emotes, outfits and other cosmetic and utility items available at any given time.

I’d recommend this for junkies. Since you can have Chems and alcohol work separately, party boy is powerful with wine for extra ap
---
To be honest I don’t think she had much experience playing fallout, if any video games at all. Terrible weapon choice, kept missing swings, and didn’t even loot the boss. I don’t think she was running a bloodied build. What’s more likely is she has no clue what she was doing and probably doesn’t know what a bloodied build is
---
I just but 3 of 1 cap ammo
---
The Division lacks building system but otherwise is quite close. Oh, and its graphics and correct scaling of things will make you hate Fallout engine.
---
I quite like melee, doesn't require any damage boosting perks so I can use them for staying alive!
---
They fucked up the template, never fixed it, and just did it piece by piece instead of figuring out what the link is that keeps causing it.
---
At this point they should just make a template for the bug report for their atom store PA sets...
---
Also you should google what PSA means.  Seems you are arguing a point that is tangential to the original post.  Makes you come off as edgy, but not in a good way.
---
Wondering, which is worse (or better), a 1* or 3* rolling pin?  I got 2 this week, crappily enough, both are nocturnal.
---
Wow from the sounds of it the stream was a train wreck
---
Best bet next time is to buy a prepaid Visa card and only put on the money you want/need to ensure that none of your bank info is kept with Sony. This way should you forget to cancel something it won’t matter and you can easily reload cards.
---
3 SBQs on two different private servers and the lag was unbearable. We all called it after the 3rd. Just got too much to handle for all of us. The post patch issues just keep piling up
---
It’s not about being viable or not. Every build is viable. Bloodied is the most popular right now because it’s a very fun build to piece together. It has a ton of synergy that adds up to very satisfying damage numbers.  
---
  
---
That doesn’t make it the only way to be OP. There are dozens of ways to build your character to output massive numbers. Check out a guy named BattleStation1, if you watch twitch. He’s a master at theorycrafting and min/maxing damage.
---
I do the event when I can as a bloodied player and take the pylons, all you gotta do is pop a super stim and a quantum 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
Got two, and they're adorable, thank you.
---
Yes it does. Be careful.
---
This game is the worst game that I have ever loved. It is so embarrassingly flawed in so many ways. I wish i could stop playing it, and go back to playing games where i would rarely (if ever) encounter a single bug. There are no "builds", instead just legendary effects haphazardly thrown in which happens to work in one or two decent ways. Power armor is a joke. And yes, after basically removing the need for PC and XB players to purchase the base game with Gamepass, they have moved to a more predatory model by removing daily and weekly Atom challenges. 
---
New players come in and buy a few Atom Store bundles, then move on - whereas old players spend like maybe 300 Atoms a week if that. Player turnover is more profitable than player retention. Atom Store content is more profitable than fixing bugs that are nearing two years old. 
---
There is **no** quality assurance, and their content as well as most of their cosmetics appear to be added without prior testing. Multiple complaints that PTS testers are having their reports ignored. And ugh... "Legendary" perks 🤦‍♂️ veteran players are being punished for every perk card they have ever missed out on in favour of moving a SPECIAL point because the game has no proper respec option. The people who just recently moved 5 points because the previous patch broke Adrenaline are now 5 levels further away from a Legendary Perk - and another 5 if they have since moved them back. 
---
This game is actually terrible in so many ways, and I hate that I love it. It pretty much an addiction at this point to people hanging out for their next fix of false hope that this dumpster fire can be made into something greater. It is as if they gave access to the FO4 assets to a bunch of amateurs and said "just make whatever. It only has to work well enough to implement microtransactions."
---
And from what I have read about the livestream, it confirms most (if not all) of my thoughts. I didn't even bother watching it because I knew it would be shameful and the issues would be swept under the rug for the sake of luring in some more potential short-term customers for the Atom Store moneyprinting machine.
---
But.. I still play it every day 😔
---
Well, okay, by that argument there is no risk/reward at all, so there is no reason to worry about balance. It doesn't matter. There's no risk. Shooting them all day with a level 1 pipe pistol and eating grenades for fun is equally as viable.
---
Now that the hyperbole is out of the way, yes, sure, there is no real risk. Beyond having to run back to your loot, wherever it dropped, while dealing with whatever spanked you in the first place, which is not really terrible. Any maybe loosing out during an event if you lost track and the SBQ sat on your face or something. But like all video games, there is the illusion of risk, and I enjoy the illusion of power that goes with it.
---
Events!

HA HA HA, I JUST LOOOOVE SONGGGS, DONT YOUOU

So you like to inflict horror on visiting redditors?

Oh my I will be chuckling all day at this

With 2 points in Bandolier and an AWR armour piece Ultracite 45 is weightless 👍🏻
---
That was the point of the comment 😂
---
Why? If you don’t like it don’t donate? I haven’t donated anything, because the rewards to me are not worth it over something that I use so much.
---
I’ll still probably get the community rewards though, so it’s a win.
---
I just wish I could turn off pacisist mode faster when some jacko steals from my camp, and kill him before he deposits the scrap he just stole from my camp robot.  Too many god dammed menus to go through.  Some punk just did that after asking me if he could pick my locked scrapbot and I said no, while I was locked in the horrid ammo converter menus.  He died regardless, but it's annoying to have to store and replace locked camp objects after being picked in order to lock them again, another idiotic glitch that they will never fix.
---
I got three star explosive combat rifle from a ghoul and a one star piece of wooden armor from the scorched beast queen
---
You’ll hear this a lot when you attempt to rationalize game mechanics by lore or real world standards. Game mechanics are put first and foremost to deliver an experience. They are not synonymous with lore. It’s a video game. The rules don’t always have to make sense, and a good game developer knows that fun comes before making sense.  
---
In the case of bloodied and junkies, they are mechanics designed to award players who are willing to take risks and penalties in order to maximize their damage output. You have to use a lot of perk cards and hunt for a very long time for the gear to make the build work. Maybe it’s a little overpowered, and maybe it’s a little too accessible, but it’s far from the best.  
---
There’s nothing wrong with giving players goals.
---
Really there is no point in farming for perfect legendaries. The game is way too easy to even try for a B2525 or what not. 
---
Just having bloodied which is very common will be enough for the entire game.
---
For some reason, mine goes off if I am standing somewhere I can't get without marsu/jet pack. If I move a few dozen feet away on solid ground, it lets me. Alternatively, it lets me if I choose a new fast travel target. Annoying, but that's about it.
---
I got a bloody/vatscrit/weightless lever gun from Daguerre’s daily quest today.  RNG is RNG.  Sometimes you get a shitty rolling pin, sometimes you get something pretty decent.
---
I just very reluctantly moved to a bloodied build and, while my previous build was “viable,” my bloodied build is everything I used to be and then a dozen things more.
---
Some highlights:
---
1) my SPECIALS are all in the high 20s and 30s now except END which is 9
---
2) my per shot damage is 327 (over double what it used to be with instigating) now with a fire rate of 33 and incredible range and accuracy. With Crits and sneak attacks I use very few bullets
---
3) I earn literally triple the XP in the same amount of playtime.
---
IME, it feels a lot like I’d been playing the game in hard mode and just dropped back to easy mode. If I were to put on Power Armor I’m sure it would feel like god mode or story mode because radiation damage and falling damage are really the only things that can actually kill me.
---
Finally one last point - SCORE was clearly developed with the bloodied exp gain in mind. Now that I’m bloodied I pull another +1 square further ahead of Zorba every day. Before going bloodied, I was barely keeping up and starting to slip behind. Now I’m 8 squares ahead of him even as the eco cost gets higher.
---
30 :(
---
Nah, I've played almost 150h since update 20 and haven't hit the bug once.
---
Prime version of weapons that don’t have many mods like Gatling gun, LMG, plasma Gatling boosts damage quite a bit.
---
Happened to me like an hr or 2 ago. Scripted a bss powerfist. It felt like a punch to my throat/ a knot of pure anger. And hr later I'm still mad.
---
This made me laugh man you dont mind if i do the same right
---
What you commented has nothing to do with my post
---
You don't even need to get Good With Salt.  Put the time in to do the Tadpole Badges and get the max level backpack with the Refrigerated Mod.  It's just as, if not better, than the GwS perk.
---
Making bloodied terrible at stealth would mean that only full health stealth builds are viable which means that unyeilding agility bonus would be there for no reason. So you'd only be wearing Chinese stealth armor considering it's the best stealth armor and on par with unyeilding. Bloodied doesn't need MORE DOWNSIDES there needs to be more perks and legendary effects added to the game that specifically cater to full health builds.
---
I hate the low hp.
---
Performance issues to return?  There's a very noticable lag when building in a camp, which wasn't there before the patch.  
---
Aside from performance, I've come across instances where you can no longer remove floor pieces or stairs without removing every wall and roof piece attached to them, or angled walls not snapping in place if there is a roof above.
---
Mind you I can still float walls, create double sided doors, pass wires through walls, etc.
---
These new "checks" your devs put in for camp building, seem poorly constructed and cause more problems than they fix.  
---
Unfortunately, this isn't going to get any better, either.  I work with other developers on a daily basis and I am aware of what kind of code gets produced when features are introduced prior to bugs being fixed -- especially when PMs are pushing them to meet a deadline.
---
I keep traveling then moving like im in glue. Cant even play with that crap happening.
---
be aware, Fed76's pricing is based on their own trading discord, so some variance applies. If it's less than 10k, I usually sell it for around 80% of their listed price and get fair volume in sales. If it's above 10k, it becomes a lot harder to predict.
---
Same for me.
---
The last thing this game needs is another grind with another currency or another event with ultrarare drop rates.
---
Don’t get me wrong, I love spending my time in Appalachia working towards something but after so many successful radiation rumble, riding shotgun, project paradise and encryptid - and still missing out on the plan rewards its just a pita.
---
Even on top, I stopped the rep grind before the legendary run as doing the same 2, 3 dailies over and over again just to grind for bullion at the same time is too much for me.
---
I agree with your wall of text.
---
Loving this game is like loving an autistic child.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hx2sxk/title_plan_mule_v2_the_solution_to_which_plans_am/
---
You'll probably want a backup weapon for scorchbeasts, the damage tends to rubber band on them a lot when shotgunning them.
---
I have 30+ of each "uncommon" (jester, sun, etc.) and it barely sells at 5 caps.
---
I start this event many times a day. I started it so I feel an obligation to finish it. Being a bloodied build is not an excuse. I play bloodied and I go full health form the start. 
---
I use secret agent and a Marklll Stealth boy. I grab all 3 pylons and spam stims (maybe 5-10). Once I have the last one I spot the imposter and get close and stop spamming stims packs. My health drops, but not as quick as his. it works every time.
---
Edit: What ever you choose to do, **DON'T** start the event unless you payed for the key!!!!
---
You say that, but that's basically what I do.  Unyielding + Herd Mentality + Food Buffs, with True pieces on your gun, means you don't really need perks like Grim Reaper's Sprint or Four Leaf Clover because with a Luck stat that high, you're filling your Crit Meter in 2-3 shots anyways.  And all that AGI means you have enough AP to do VATS for days.
---
&gt;**Collection periods for each objective will begin and end at 11:00 a.m. CT on the dates listed below.**
---
Seems like most people fail to realize that all these updates and content drops are free, whereas a lot of games would charge. It surely costs them a decent amount of money to deliver these things, buggy as they may be, because labor isn't free. So yeah, they need to make some profit, and they chose to do it almost entirely with currency purchases while letting everyone enjoy the real content for free. It's really quite amazing that they let us get that many free atoms for as long as they did.
---
The point is, figuring what I want to do on my day off
---
The game has pvp in it don’t be mad bc you probably a food build
---
Does rad sugar bombs count?
---
No. As of now in PTS Earl is more tanky than sbq and also is more dangerous with damage overtime. Even with a B2525 primed fixed and appropriate build it will take longer than a minute.
---
I always feel bad whenever I one shot one with my Deathclaw gauntlet.  I feel like it's adding unnecessary humiliation to it.
---
It's a 3 star guaranteed drop at the end of the event
---
Stop being an entitled little dipshit.  There were ZERO extra rewards for the community goals last year and people did it perfectly fine without whining as much as people like you have been this year.  All we got out of it was a bunch of far shittier random rewards, most of which were fucking icons and photo frames.
---
The crates don't have rare items inside because they aren't supposed to be equivalent to the presents/pails.  Those existed in limited supply (dupers excluded) with the intent of draining caps fromthe economy.  these crates simply exist as a small bonus for turning scrap in.
---
If you want to be an entitled little prick then go cry in a corner counting your scrap and leave everyone else to enjoy themselves.
---
Id rather they just focus on fallout 5  with online components them bring 76 over. Give us a single player game for the main story but allow our friends to join in as companions.
---
Will say im pretty excited for Doom DLC
---
You reminded me of my first bounty,it was fun!,i survived with it for 3 days,then several players who had finished the SBQ event  got bored and decided to pay me a visit at my poseidon energy workshop,back then we had only 400 space in our stash,so i had a LOT of junk on me, luckily back then the only way to take a workshop was through the claim point, and i had constructed a building with several defences and locked doors around it,they got me but in the process some of them got wanted too and got executed by their former allies also i got to keep my workshop!.
---
You need do quests, I had similar situation as you, I hated the game because I didn’t level up, but when I started doing the quests it all changed, you’ll start leveling up and getting mew armor and weapons, and the game gets better
---
I've read heaps about the fixer, where do I get one so I can start rolling legendaries? Been on and off with 76 since release, just getting back into it the last few days.
---
You can't be serious!
---
The games are fine. If they don't run well it's your PC that can't handle the game. 
---
Its optimised the same way on hamepass as it is on steam and bethesda launcher as they have crossplay and require the exact same version to olsy together
---
You can't do quests if you get killed by a enemy that apparently is immune to taking bullets.
---
Same here, the rewards are crap vs the actual useful resources, so I didn't donate either.
---
But at the same time, on a community level, rushing to it and completing it (so fast at that), justifies Bethesda doing these crap mobile f2p style "events" in the first place. They look at data, participation and all, they see we "love" it, and it'll become a regular thing. And we'll be getting more and more of it at the expense of even more actual content (or fixes) - practically zero effort to implement, for abysmal chances at a few maybe moderately decent "rewards". That's why.
---
Forager and Punk can be found one of two ways. Random encounter or in the underground of Foundation or Crater, respectively. 
---
The Settler Wanderer can be found as only a random encounter. Pick her if you can tolerate guitar and hippie lines.
---
Making comments about the hovel he has to work in
---
U gotta be smoking crack? There’s loads to do if ur low level keep smashing out missions and it won’t take u long
---
Most likely because they had planned the stream and couldn't back out.
---
Do the quests. Find some friends to help you.
---
The OP was asking if there was any benefit to siding with one faction or the other, which, in all honesty, there isn't. I just pointed out the fact the Chinese stealth suit was available from the Settlers, which some folk find appealing to boost sneak attacks and damage boosts. While the Raiders do present you with the minigun plans, which certainly helps the kicking ass side if the game. No actual exclusive items you won't eventually gain by grinding the other faction later.
---
No intention of misleading intended.
---
Its not surprising.
---
What quest are you on?
---
Cool. Maybe one day I’ll be brave enough to solo it. Not today!
---
So you're saying they showcased a delayed event, glitches and poor loot drops for money?
---
Stuff that is directly ripped from other sources?
---
Right there with you I think I’m going to keep playing until I finish the current season then take a break from 76. It has become a chore. The events are nice but what I like about the game is a story even the vanilla game had a good story that drove the play but now it’s just a grind same quests same dialogue it’s boring.
---
The whiny entitled dipshits you see on the front page of this sub don't represent the VAST majority of the people that actually play the game, they're just the squeakiest wheels.
---
And for the MILLIONTH time.  The crates from this event were NEVER EVER EVER EVER EVER meant  to be on the same level as the holiday gifts or mole miner pails.  Those existed to provide an additional cap sink to help drain the economy.  They existed in a limited supply based on the caps available to buy them and even after someone spent all the caps they had on hand buying more was limited by the daily cap limits.  These crates on the other hand can be farmed infinitely as long as you have the will to farm scrap.  All they're meant to be is a tiny bonus so you're not just flushing your scrap down the drain entirely.  Crates didn't even exist for last years community goals and people threw away their time fighting fucking scorched in the millions.
---
People like whining about them because again, entitled dipshits.
---
I was surprised it wasn’t already dead when I went there today. I didn’t want to go to that Thunder Mountain substation.
---
Always some kind of damn radroach that make me blow myself up
---
I'm having a hard time getting into the game. Probably because I have no idea what I'm supposed to do and that I chose hardcore on my first run.
---
[](/lyraquestion)Oh man, I am not with you on the vault raid, that shit was stress and anger for me and mine. Different strokes for different folks I guess. I'm right around 1.5k hours myself. Still having a good time, but I'm playing for shorter periods than I used to. Mostly since I've all but completed my collection of every Junkies weapon in the game, and haven't figured out what I can grind for that'll still fit in my stash.
---
And if I am not mistaken, it also effects the explosive effects on legendary weapons. Can anyone confirm or deny this?
---
It’s a great way for new players to get plans and also convert mats to caps. People like us who have all of those things are a minority in the real life.
---
And the moleminer event was way more involved, yet people loathed that one. Pretty mixed signals.
---
I welcome these events, especially with community rewards. There is no downside.
---
Solo is rough, this is the strategy I use on public. It gets the job done.
---
Oh crud i just realised my mistake in my wording I meant legendary explosive weapons from the get go. I'll repost with correct question.
---
 Sorry to rant on your rant, but I see a lot of high level players at events like Encrypted, Riding Shotgun, and Radiation Rumble who act like all they can do is shoot. Not everybody does it, and there are plenty of work horses doing objectives, but it feels like there are just as many leeches out there. Disregard if you are a lower level, it's not your job to carry us to success. 
---
    Bloodied build here. I can and normally will tank 2-3 pylons at encrypted and will also normally do a large chunk of damage. I'm no where near as good as some of my friends, but if I have to, I can solo it. It's very possible to tank the damage as a bloodied build, I just dont think a lot of people know that. It's also not hard to collect ore, and yet a lot of people dont for some reason. Four boxes, dont oneshot the Captain and pick up four boxes....how do you mess that up?
---
     Another thing I think people do that holds them back is adopt a damage dealer mindset. Im a damage build, my character is most effective when I'm shooting. If I dont shoot the enemies, who is going to shoot the enemies? Very nice bud, my damage numbers are high too. Not as high as yours would probably be, but all 9 of us here would be able to kill her more quickly if people would go ahead and grab those pylons.  Oh cool, you showed up just in time to reinforce the 8 other guys oneshotting the ghouls while we only have 38 ore, one guy collecting, and 3 minutes on the clock. It's not like there are plenty of rad suits lying around, rad showers are right beside the turn in,  and nothing attacks you in the mines so you literally have no excuse unless you will weigh 1,000 pounds without you armor. I'm glad I started this event so you can show up 3 minutes in to slaughter the legendary and then stand around while I collect boxes. That doesnt always apply, but there are a large amount of leeches out there. It's also pretty easy to accidentally oneshot world spawn enemies, but it's not hard to let people get hits on ones you know are guaranteed.
---
     It sucks but sometimes you just have to let the event fail. Either people will have to step or everybody gets nothing. And then maybe next time they will try a little harder. Sadly, it's getting to where its much more fun doing "public" events in private servers without the public.
---
It just seems like I solo because no one else helps with the pylons. I don't want to play this way.
---
These exporters are so stupid. You don’t have to build a bunch of walls to make the game lag, just do the encrypted event like wth.
---
Hunter for Hire
---
Have you done the overseer quests? Because those are the real new player quest
---
SHOCKED and AWED at the downvotes.   
---
You merely fear what you cannot understand!  
---
This is, from all angles, a stonking idea.
---
Yeah that is pretty rough. Like eating an omelette with chicken meat in it.
---
But it has nothing to do with the community contest/camp builds
---
Man, I have tried to be generous but by the time I have whipped up some Heavy Deep Pocketed Leather gear and a tricked out Revolver Pipe Rifle for a lowbie I see, they have utterly vanished and I cannot find them again.
---
I've basically just resorted to throwing the 1 star Legendaries I get from Leader of the Pack in the Overseer Cache across from the Wayward rather than turning them in for Scrip.
---
Absolute frickin legend I want to know this person
---
You probably dislike coming here sometimes lol
---
Better yet, have it so the weekly challenges don't expire until the end of the season. Offer daily challenges to boost progress, but the real bulk of the progression should be tied to weekly challenges that you complete on your own time. Most games that offer these types of passes use the system I just described. Why Bethesda decided to try and reinvent the wheel is beyond me.
---
I nEeD tO tRy ThIs NuKaShInE
---
I second heavys. There is so much variety and with bear arms you can carry as many as you want
---
Want to play a sniper? Gattling gun or plasma caster
---
Want to spray and pray? Gauss mini or mini
---
Want to a half ass efficient bad ass gun? 50cal
---
Want to torch a room and have great crowd control? Flamers
---
Want the best shot gun? Harpoon
---
Want to shoot 1k rounds without reloading? Gattling laser+power user
---
Want to feel like a crazy scientist? Gattling plasma
---
Want to shred the Queen and use a ton of ammo? Lmg
---
I made a mini drinking area once and said drink up
---
The persons who commented before is absolutely correct but another point to be made is that the queen has around a 70% damage reduction, so if you’re gun does around 100 per shot than you’re only hitting 30 dmg
---
Not yet. HfH popped up after I talked to the NPC after exiting V76
---
Yea, start going through that as hfh came in after the wastelanders update. So your best bet would just be to do the overseer quests
---
Not really, since certain times are ported from fallout 4 or are common items that has already existed ingame but never got a real release like the lunchboxes.
---
Also, we were able to obtain atoms from challanges the past 1.5 years now, and with the season we only get 1/3 of previous atoms for doing the same or now even more challanges.
---
Gauss rifles have had a rough time since wastelanders.
---
“Stop hitting yourself!”
---
This game is not like other MMOs where you skip the story to powerlevel through it as quickly as possible to get to the end game content.  This game HAS NO end game content, the entire game is all about experiencing the story and exploring the small unmarked discoveries around the map and loving the world the game thrusts you in.
---
If that's not your bag then I honestly really would suggest refunding it.
---
Yeah, I don't see that guys reasoning unless it's "big corporations show shit products during showcases to get more money" wtf
---
Some level 30 guy got wanted, I fasted travelled to him. Messaged him on xbox live explaining that he was wanted and that I need the kill for a challenge (I even offered to pay them). The guy starts sprinting away from me. After I'd killed him I left his stuff and waited for him to come back and get it. Instead of getting his dropped loot he ran up to me and started screaming at me in the game chat. He's was clearly mad that I removed his bounty and left his 325 steel scraps.
---
I know, but intentionally crashing the servers is way to roll back progress on a character, and cause mischeif
---
After a few assassination attempts on me, I've truly started to build up my bait numbers.
---
Taking names for my list as it happens. One day I'll find it unattended....
---
I only use a primed receiver on my gauss mini because crafting normal 2mm is ridiculous. On any other gun I’d just keep it with a hardened or powerful automatic because flux farming is time consuming and not fun in the slightest, It took months of grinding to get the gauss mini and I hardly use it because I don’t want to farm flux
---
Edit: as far as I know
---
Gorgeous!

I just got to level 100 and I feel like I know nothing about this game. I have no idea how you achieve the things you're saying. I use an instigating hunting rifle (plus 50% damage for VATS crits) with the hardened .50 reciever and a bunch of rifle perks, and headshots one-shot most things I fight. But obviously I do about zero damage to scorchbeast queen and wendigo colossus. I didn't discover mutations until about level 70 and those were a gamechanger.
---
I don't understand the bloodied thing. I need to look up a guide or something I guess.
---
Did it at release but was removed in the TSE nerf?
---
I guess the way the game is rn everyone automatically assumes Bethesda wants money (which is mostly true). I'm surprised people havnt tried to link the BOS community event to greed yet.
---
Did you ever had a ammo factory blueprinted from the workshop inside your camp? Either placed by yourself or someone being in a group with you.
---
Cant recall that
---
They set them up to pass. Imagine it failing... "No one is playing this game" would be the headline for every post. They just want you on the game grinding.
---
Camp pets are confirmed to come without any date yet.
---
This idea is awesome and I totally would buy it, aswell alot of other folks which are annoyed by the robot.
---
I’d be explosive baiting straight through that
---
Yeah I had to redo my camp because of it I didn’t like them
---
I do like being threatened by the raider robot. But welcome face would be a nice change.
---
Lmao. Disgusting.
---
There you go, this is the source of the phantom budget. No fix afik atm,  probably contact support but I also heard of players got banned because they used it, Idk if they lied to hide they were duping tho.
---
Yes, you worded it better than me.  I didn't play just because of the PVP.  I liked the *danger* of knowing someone could kill you.  It's kind of like the old Fallout games where players could choose to be good or bad. Now everyone is forced to be on the same team.  Making players unable to hurt each other takes away that fear of the unknown.
---
Maybe one near flatwoods since that's the easiest place to go
---
Its definitely the easiest game to level up in
---
Ah yeah, that's a fair point.  Hadn't considered the benefit of getting the extra caps after the daily vender limit has been reached.
---
God damn it😤 It wasn’t me who placed it there
---
One star assassins pipe pistol will always be my favorite
---
Take my upvote
---
I once caught him sleeping on an instrument
---
Do you know of a recent list, one that is up to date?
---
I just glanced at it and found several mistakes. like "damaged hazmat" and the "scout masks".
---
Build?
---
God how I hate elitist programmers. Calm down, you're not curing cancer.
---
AFAIK no one was banned yet for modded game.
---
There was a link to Beth support, where they answer just "nodding is not supported in this game".
---
In theory, yes, you can be banned, since you are modifying game files and it is violation of ToS, but there are no evidence of banning for this.
---
If you are using moss from nexus, you should be safe.
---
I know someone who build dozens of them at a random camp, blocked more then half the budget. Guess this guy is fuked aswell...
---
In your case, 1% isn't that much. A few decoration items or 1-2 walls perhaps, not such a big deal.
---
From your text it seemed like getting the the possum backpack for completing tadpole wad the hard part. That takes no possum badges. Possum badges takes a bit more yes.
---
I think it would be nice if you can still get more level after hitting lvl100 on the SCORE Board but you only get items like lunchboxes, scrapboxes, etc. maybe caps and/ or legendary scrips and/or Gold Bouillions.
---
More like a blind and deaf quadriplegic child.
---
I have this issue as well, but never used the ammo factory glitch thingy.
---
You level up really quickly. The overseer quests literally introduce you to the game and gives you levels.
---
This. 
---
Also I shoot it nonetheless to keep it aggroed to me in the rare case someone else decides to take the rest of the pylons. Which they rarely do or die in seconds.
---
Did they stutter
---
Now the G R I N D starts
---
I think that kind of change would make a lot of people angry.  The simple fact that this is the way beth gave this pass to us will put a lot of people in a mind set of "this is how it should be, if it doesn't work for you that doesn't matter".  Which makes little sense really seeing all the things they fuck up with this game on a regular basis, and had they presented it any other way those same people would probably be applauding it for being player friendly, and defending it tooth and nail against any criticism , because that's just how it seems to be with some people.    
---
So I was just trying to suggest a tweak that people who can and choose to play every day can still feel special, and thus less likely to be opposed.
---
I'm enjoying a sneak shotgun build.
---
Hahaha you fool it has only begun 5.4k caps is traveling caps
---
I'm not coming at it from an elitist perspective. It's just frustrating to here people complain about stuff that's fairly explicable and say "seems easy to me as someone who doesn't program"
---
Who ended up that way from *intentionally* jumping headfirst from a balcony..
---
Demolition expert is what you’re looking for
---
Yes but a bloodied player will also have their own buffs which will make them stronger.
---
Wait a minute its a skin not a helmet of its own...
---
Not really, since Bethesda drastically reduced the legendary spawn rate and gain of exp there. West tec is the new go-to location you can easylie do solo without nuking.
---
I want the anatomically correct ghouls....
---
Less gatekeeping please.
---
The End User License Agreement usually spells out what the company can do with user created content. The creation club from FO4 was supposed to drop a little cash back onto creators, but for Bethesda it gave them an idea of what was popular. It does seem unfortunate that the people responsible for getting FO4 into a working state were unpaid.
---
and mine!
---
Yes, I nuke ws in My private server for farm legendary and Fluxs, when I finish a round, change character and start other round. 
---
In 2 hours you can get 15o Fluxs and lot legendaries
---
Sadly you can only get it from the dev room or from someone who duplicated it  it and is selling it online
---
Dogmeat!! 🥰🥰
---
No I know what demolition does. I was just wandering if I could make the radius of my explosive bullets larger. Could've sworn it worked before tse got nerfed early game
---
I agree!
---
Replace it with a 'Kill Ward' daily!
---
I would do that daily even if it did not give any rewards!
---
like 2 or 3 perk cards
---
Say what you will about their effort in the workplace but don’t make fun of their physical appearance. Be a better person then that at least and have some decency. It’s a video game; devs aren’t committing war crimes or worse.
---
Will not happen since there are items which are only acquired by having the plan. Secret service, wastelands gauss weapons, strangler heart power armor, thorn and solar, fixer, bear arms, tenderizer and so on.
---
Bethesda don't want characters to have this items if they don't have the plans.
---
Lmfao, ikr
---
I tried doing a melee fight with a stock ski sword and my Unyielding. That did not end well at all until I put on my SH and switched to a combat knife for more hits per second. Then I was constantly making his dodgy go off so he couldn’t VATS me lmao
---
They need to make armor for other builds. Like a berserker prefix.    Insane secret service chest 0 Dr with usual stats.   Or a junkie set like Addict secret service chest +1 damage per addiction.    A vengeful weapon would be good too something that does more damage at full health.  Heck make a 2 shot build where each piece of armor adds another projectile.
---
Ahh thank you for that!
---
Not me! I know how to avoid debt. *insert black think guy here*
---
I was using my lvl 50 plasma Gatling and I can’t see how I wouldn’t have done less than 1000, thanks for the info
---
Underarmor mods, too.
---
I spend that much everyday on my morning coffee!
---
Save and look for good legendaries and cheap mutations(if you use them) at player vendors
---
Or allow us to dress up our collectrons like our camp allies
---
WRONG THEY'RE FUCKING GOVERNMENT TAX MEN TRYING TO BRING BACK TAXES, SAME WITH THE ENCLAVE, RESPONDERS ARE COPS ACAB, ANARCHY RAIDERS FOR LIFE AHHHH
---
It shouldn't be buffed either. Junkies and several other builds should get buffed.
---
There should me a build specific cards for all the builds. Like radicool and nerd rage. But that would require modifying the perk system which seeing as Bethesda cant even implement a load out system that should have been in the game since day one.
---
I myself been a bloodied build for awhile now but mostly because of carry weight and stash space. Once I saw the dmg out put for just a 1* bloodied combat shotgun I was hooked. I wish other builds had that moment in the game.
---
Same goes with my bud idk why this happened. Alrhough in my case I had someone place it in my camp
---
I dont mind running it either you either.
---
The exploit was giving some trolls the ability to lag servers and get access to people’s stashes. However the way they approached the problem was not very smart.
---
Whale bones.
---
Theresa a couple notes that tall about whales like they were giant flying razor finned monsters. But I'm 99%sure that was just never seeing them in real life since they cant get to the shore or because in this universe they died out long ago. Could bea fossil, could be a corpse got blown to Appalachia from the ocean from one of the bombs.
---
Grounded by Obsidian has been pretty fun
---
Short form is "Everything". I'm not interested in either a Bloody build or a Junkie build, nor do I want any mutations, and I hate power armor.  I want to keep my high Int and high Cha, since that's the character. At level 356, I have access to whatever perks, but I don't have much in the way of "God-Tier" weapons. The best is probably the half armor, 25% faster firing, 25% less VATS Fixer I have but I don't often use it. (Mind you, most everything I have is a VATS reduction, because I *cannot* hit anything without it. VATS is the one and only way I can play.)

It used to be Lone Wanderer instead of the team-based Charisma abilities, but the new public team option changed that. I like building camps the most, or crafting, with some exploring, and I'm not really here for the shooting ... I can't hit the braod side of a barn (and boy oh boy, do I HATE having to go into Nuclear Winter for challenges!) without VATS. 
---
So, you know... not a lot of options out there. All of my armor's Combat, picked out for reducing weapon weight (the four limbs) and to recover healt and Action Points (chestplate.) My main guns are an instigating hunting rifle, an explosive western revolver, and an anti-ghoul fixer (also faster fire rate and reduced VATS cost), with an anti-armor 10 MM pistol I use for bugswatting. 
---
I have an Executioner's Shishkebob as well, for when I need to go into events. Popping Hard bargain over for Friendly Fire lets me heal robots at Fastnacht, engineers at Radiation Rumble, and so on.
---
Hilarious
---
For purified water there are only three options:
---
Small purifier, peaceable on (real) dirt, medium and large purifier which are only placeable inside real water. Everything else is just a reskin or like you mentioned a dirty water collector.
---
The only way you can have purified water legit is to craft it from dirty water, or glitch around with rugs if that is still possible.
---
This caps will give you 1-2 good plans, mate.
---
What you can do: 
---
1. Make your build perfect for you
---
2. Get the best weapons for your build
---
3. Build the best camp and after that an even better camp
---
4. Collect rare items (e.g. try to get the Forest Camo Jumpsuit)
---
All in all you game begins with lvl 50.
---
Yeah if we wanted to hear from someone who doesn't program we'd talk to some FO76 devs.
---
**HEYOOOOOO**
---
This happened to me today, didn’t realize this was a known bug
---
This is the price for the glitched ammo factory. It will permanently feed on your budget, no way to remove it from your budget. If you place more, it will use more.
---
Pay Todd 500 atoms for a fire extinguisher
---
all I want is the ability to wear a traffic cone as a hat
---
No. But I would slap on the new Diablo mask, get a flaming pitchfork and terrify the wasteland!!!!!!
---
I mean, of course, how else are we gonna get you addicted to chems if we don't start you off with free ones?
---
&gt; half-sane build
---
Assuming your core weapons ain't bugged, of course. *cough* explosive weapons *cough*
---
You lose junk which sounds like no big deal but losing a bag inclines players to become fallout 1st members.
---
It's a business tactic and another reason they won't buff other full health builds.
---
Nice I just built up a strip club near top of the world.
---
Stop, drop, and roll?
---
Go for a swim?
---
Your agile hands move quick enough to produce twice as much shit from the same amount of shit. You're fast enough to fool the steel about how much of it is really there.
---
I had it happen to me, i just basically forced my game to crash and it fixed it
---
How would I find such a website
---
If you used a bloodied build you would take cry about it needing to be nerfed, try again.
---
I'm not talking about atomic shop items, I agree that it's pretty extreme to charge for things that are essentially just ports, junk walls being a prime example being put behind what is ~$10 bundle.
---
What I was talking about were the actual updates/add ons, Wastelanders being the most prominent. Script writing. Coding. Voice acting. Advertising. None of that is free. I'm sure even every tweet is written by a staff member while they're on the clock. But they give it to us for free in hopes of increasing their audience. More audience means more atomic shop traffic. Now the limited free atoms means more people will be inclined to buy atoms.
---
And that's my point. We got free money for well over a year. We still get free money, just less. It's not like they were ever required to give us free money in the first place. I'm guessing one of the main reasons they did was so that people who played the game more would essentially walk around as advertisements for the items in the shop, then people who didn't grind the dailies would want and then go spend real money to buy.
---
None of this is to say I support the decisions behind this, but you can't deny that it makes more sense for them on the financial side of things. That or they start charging for the actual content.
---
Good luck, they just patched the big glitch to put it on both sides
---
I did that too, the last couple weeks, but I was only able to get 4 or 5 rounds in, before the nuke zone vanished. (It was a game I like to play, called 'cab I get a weeks worth of scrip') I was wondering if there was a more efficient way. Like I was saying above, people used to do this between 9 and 12 times an hour before they got bored
---
There's plenty of other builds that are viable. Too many people want to min-max this game though and then complain there's only one META. Well no shit, it wouldn't be META if there's multiple METAs, now would it?
---
I'm happy with my vanguard armor, enforcer shotgun build. Now specializing in heavy weapons for things like the queen and Colossus. Got myself a .50 sniper rifle and a .45 semi auto rifle for easy targets. I'm sure I don't do max damage, but I have yet to run into any enemies in this game that I felt I couldn't handle. And honestly people who one-shot everything around them tend to just be annoying more than anything else. The last two queens events I was part of the queen went down in 30 seconds flat. Where's the fun in that??
---
are you kidding?  my kid starting playing after work today and in two hours was lvl10.  jfc.
---
That's really dumb. It's like they may as well just fully remove wallpaper at that point.
---
Imagine avoiding confrontation and stressing over ammo expenditure. 
---
Stealth bloodied builds are the meta slaves of the game.
---
I am! But not for those lame BoS stooges.
---
Not really sure since it's all over the place. I would call it balanced. Full health with 600+ Dmg resistance. It's more about picking the right weapon for the situation so I carry a lot. Plasma caster, Gauss Rifle, flamer, tesla rifle, magic pump shotgun, 10mm pistol etc. (All reduced weight of course) and switching between them helps conserve ammo  (having a shotgun that is broken and can one shot anything helps immensely)
---
How have you got to 100 already?  Sorry if I've missed something but I'm only just starting part 3 on the score and have done all but two days of challenges.
---
For me, it's 0.45 ammo at 1 cap. But I'd say well-priced flux gets me most excited. Back in the day on the marketplace it would be 100 caps each but it much more now. After that would be those very rare plans that I don't own, but only if under 100 caps.
---
Eh, I’m ok with not having it on both sides, and I’m pretty sure there is another glitch still usable, that uses a flamer, but I’m not too sure about that
---
Yuuuuuuup
---
Flamethrower trap = double walls after the patch 👍
---
People you see wearing that outfit bought it on ebay
---
This.
---
I would personally add a nuke, for good measure :-)
---
you nearly had a good idea, you just picked the wrong weapon. commie wacker. commie wacker. commie wacker.
---
that was a twitch issue not a fo76 issue
---
It looks hella mutated though, like it has four tusks. Also 76 is set in a time when people would still know what's up, at least a quarter of people were alive pre-war. Lots of 40-something year olds around, not to mention cryo and ghouls and such.
---
Good news is they're still a thing! Garbage devs
---
You seem pretty pleased about the bait-and-switch for some reason
---
Does ultracite have the same stats as strangler or what? Why is strangler special? Pun intended
---
Wow. This is the first time I've ever seen this! And I fast travel a lot. Is this is a common thing?
---
(Todd plays "We didn't start the fire")

The fast ones. Manhunt, fly swatter.

The xp ones. Line in the sand, radiation rumble, and guided meditation

my wife has been playing her new toon for 2 months, she's LVL 278 as of today. she's a compulsive farmer tho.

Tip: Group up. My experience is that you can loot everything any of team mates killed.
---
I’m a WW2 Russian reenactor. A company started making them again some years back and I bought mine from a friend.
---
it's a quest series
---
how much score do you need to earn to rank up at rank 100?
---
3475 I believe
---
it's the whale from hitchhiker's guide
---
To fill in the void of any tangible Fo76 content demonstration at Qcon. Organisation-wise. 
---
To rub it in our face. Playerbase-wise.
---
When I finish it will it give me the fixer?
---
You start it in one of the train stations first by examining the Sheepsquach Ate My Brother poster. It should lead you to the Taxidermy Shop. There are other side quests once you get there, but the main one starts outside.
---
jesus christ thats like three weeklies and 2 and a half dailies
---
Hacked items, only obtainable when spawned in or stolen out of the dev rooms
---
Not with a Molotov, but I've had the Ash pile effect on me for a long time after being killed by an Assaultron's head laser and being ashed by it.
---
[Then I changed the colors and made my own frame for it.](https://imgur.com/P5LSrpl)
---
Not tusks, those are parts of the upper and lower jaw. Most whales have jaw bones that dont connect in the fronts of the lower jaw. Some species have 2 parts to the upper jaw too think.
---
Smelt spoiled food. That‘s my main source for fertilizer.
---
When I examined the one at the train station it just shows the text, never started any quest
---
It's a very long story line. You do start there. Eventually you have to do the Encryptid event and the chance at a Fixer plan. Note that you don't have to do the event yourself. My current character hasn't done it but I got the plan by participating in someone else's event. Just today I was lucky enough to score a spare plan to sell.
---
I think I'm like two squares ahead of Zorbo right now. I'm almost certain I've done all the non-NW SCORE things every single day. I don't get how people are 20+ levels ahead of me.
---
Just from running around killing everything?
---
Yes, but they don't really do that. There were plenty of fixes for fallout 4 bugs (getting stuck in power armor, the lever action reload, etc) that were made by the community and this game still ended up launching with. If they won't steal community fixes, I doubt they'll take some random person's skins or outfits

You don’t need no water, let the mutha fucker burn....
---
Thanks for the advice, also, if ur on Xbox, how much r u selling that plan for?
---
Sorry, PC.
---
Bloodied isn't even the problem by itself, it doesn't outdamage junkies by alot.
---
Adrenal Reaction, Nerd Rage and Unyielding all are the balance issues that push low end builds way over anything else.
---
Unyielding : Boosts you sneak, your accuracy, your AP, faster level ups, better carry weight (adding Radicool in this one), 100% speech checks (aka more caps), better vendor prices (aka more caps again)
---
Nerd Rage : Better resists and AP refresh
---
Adrenal Reaction : Add more damage bonuses that makes  the difference between Bloodied and Junkies far worst than it should be.
---
Not to mention Serendipity, aka Coinflip 100% damage resist, whatever the damage source is (can even prevent fall damages...)
---
And you have the reason why even in PvE, Junkies builds should be low end builds. Better quality of life and too big of a difference in combat efficiency. Without all of that, Bloodied Risk/Reward would be perfectly balanced compared to junkies full health build.
---
5.4k caps and a quarter will get you on the bus. Keep saving.........
---
How many other games have given you that many hours of enjoyable play? It's okay to step away.
---
Also worth noting that the devs are likely not given much of an option. The results for the past nearly two years have been piss-poor, that's true. But if that was only the devs' fault, wouldn't you think they would have been moved around by now? The issue has to be with management. And the devs are more likely doing whatever they can with what little they're given
---
When you finish it you have the ability to start an event, you need an item to start the event so once you do the questline you will have to do the event a minimum of 100000092 times as it is a very low drop rate. Al'so each time you start the event you will need an I team that to craft you need to buy an item at a vendor for 1.9k caps. Good luck
---
That’s fine, just in case I get a spare one, how much should I sell it for
---
Also, for what its worth,  the last 3 times I killed SBQ I had to wait for almost 6 minutes before it actually registered and the loot showed up. Before that every time I ran up to her there was nothing.
---
I login daily only for the chores, but if I need a nice distraction I start the Riding Shotgun and enjoy it every time.. for like 5 minutes. I wish they did more dungeon crawling content, because it's what Bethesda excels at the most.
---
If you went inside, and started Wolf in Sheep's Clothing, then what The Gumbo said is correct. Its a quest line that leads you to getting one. The poster outside won't kick in if you started it inside...I forgot you can just go there to start it. Just keep plugging away, and you'll get one.
---
Bruh
---
You try to fast travel, and nothing happens.   Lately, it's taken as many as five attempts to actually fast travel.
---
I didn't know that hitting it while it was cloaked would tag it. Cool.
---
Then those items can’t go in the box. Or can’t be picked up by your other character if they don’t also know the plan.
---
It happens. But in general it still works. Did it yesterday.
---
Yea it’s a lot man.
---
Oh wow, I see, thanks. Weird that they have a whale in the middle of the mountains inland.
---
What tier are you on?
---
A d if you dont get it from the free event start from the questline, buy it, it will save thousands of caps and a lot of time wasted. Unless you have the ring of a god
---
Eh, either way I can't get gamepass anyways.
---
Thank you, that solves it, hitchhiker's easter egg for sure.
---
Meat has been an issue. The only work around is to cook it. Very annoying bug
---
Did they completed the challenge aswell?
---
To be fair I get lucky, on my first treasure map that I opened I got a maximum capacity napalmer (it does 111 energy damage with a fire rate of 91) that kills sentry bots in 10 seconds
---
It just feels nice to give gifts to lower level players. I felt that early game struggle and now that I have things in bounty I want to help out others
---
think you should check this site out
---
[https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks)
---
Well then try it out. But if you dont get luck its 10s of thousands of caps cheaper just to buy it
---
I’ll definitely try it out, i know what the event is, one last thing tho, if I do get it, is it a drop from the imposter sheepsquach or is it from the event rewards
---
Apparently the corpses of carnivore dolphins from F4 are somewhere in76 too.and like I said, they could just be fossils, or they could have been just thrown miles and miles from the ocean to Appalachia. Hell they could have swum up stream from the ocean to escape the radiation (or ocean mutants) and beached themselves.
---
Or, least likely, they really did evolve into flying razor finned killing machines.
---
Did I say so?
---
Event rewards. Good luck dude.
---
All depending de flora you colect, if I Want some violet and cobalt, I do 6 round, If dont, I can Do 7 or 8
---
I mean this in the nicest way possible, but jeeze, please take a break from the game. Its one thing to be a dedicated player, its another to obsessively grind like that as fast as possible --- the addiction cycle potential on this kind of dopamine reward stuff is pretty bad, so take care of yourself, chill out from the game for a bit.
---
Thanks, I’ll update u on if I get it
---
Ok. The questline starts with "lying lowe" by the way
---
6-10k
---
I'm around 1800 hours in and am starting to burn out.   I'll log in every day to turn my 200+ t notes into gold bullion if/when they add more items that I want to get with it later, but otherwise I'm done.    
---
I tried a few other games, but they're not grabbing my interest, so I dusted off Mass Effect.   Guess I'll replay that until new content drops.
---
Is it really that low? I farmed the event as wastelands got released to farm bullions, ended up with 6 plans after a few hours. Did about 40-50 events.
---
Jesus fucking Christ that says a lot about the gun
---
I was over exaggerating with the millions thing but yes you are quite lucky. I've seen people do it over 100 times and only get 2 or less
---
Some people grind XP endlessly. To me, it's a ridiculous amount, especially considering the third part of the season requires something around 7.5million xp if you want to get to the end just farming score.
---
What other games are out there though...
---
How are you guys already done? I'm almost certain I've done every SCORE challenge (aside from NW) every day, and I'm like 2 ahead of Zorbo. I don't get it.
---
No. Still sits at 9/10
---
?  In what way?  Plans were duped to hell. They’re not worth lots. A B2525 fixer is gonna cost you a legacy minimun
---
This is about as well as one could say it. Thumbs up from me.
---
Even after plans were duped to hell, that says that the gun is really good
---
That’s honestly not that much when it comes to trading and pricing.
---
No but I was stalked across 3 servers with a Government Aid Drop. No matter what I did as soon as I would travel I would hear the boom and the hiss and then the orange smoke would start. Craziest thing I’ve ever seen interested to see if it shows up again tomorrow.
---
Was gonna suggest this as well; sneak shotty build is so much fun and the crippling makes it incredible for support as well. Nothing says overkill like bringing the barrel of your shotgun up to a enemies face from stealth and blowing them away with a single round.
---
Things that consistently CTD:
---
\- interacting with vendors (non-player ones), including Legendary Exchange and Gold Bullion vending machine. Player vending machines seem to work fine.
---
Things that sometimes CTD:
---
\- exiting/entering Power Armor
---
\- exiting/entering CAMP construction mode
---
\- using workbenches
---
Others (seemingly random):
---
\- swapping weapons
---
\- being in combat
---
\- looting containers
---
\- logging in
---
I'll be back with more info as I  get it.
---
That’s wild right there. That might actually be worse
---
The event wasn't for new player, only the items in the loot table.
---
But the drop chances are so abysmal that new player are better off selling the scrap directly and buying the plans from vendors. And be honest, which new player has the need for such a large amount of alcohol?
---
Then if you don't grind out the max SCORE rank as inhumanly fast as possible, you'll miss out on free daily and weekly Atoms for the rest of the season, and you won't want to miss a day of those, either... now that's double the FOMO.
---
How did you survive its red hellblasts while meleeing it?!
---
Do you have fire proof or a dense chest piece on?
---
Mobs seem to spawn differently depending on other players in the map or area. Also depends what region of the map you're in. 
---
 
---
By chance are you using the Future tech Camp skin from The Legendary Run? The skin bricks your camp. You have to remove it and rebuilx the whole camp elsewhere /:
---
Just cosplay as beelzebub with the free costume
---
Do the easy ones first
---
I had this occur yesterday on my heavy gunner, was hella nice... tried with my rifleman and killed myself tho. Not sure what causes it, some kinda perk combo or..?
---
Which subplatform (Beth, Steam, MS)?
---
Some tips that come into my mind:
---
* Try deleting the ini files of the game.
---
* On the desktop, right click and select Screen Settings. Scroll down to graphics settings, then browse for Fallout76.exe and set it to high performance.
---
* Downclock your GPU and VRAM by 100 MHz.
---
It's a well known bug people trigger by putting their survival tent down outside the gates. Makes it easier to chuck a nade in there and get xp
---
You can get it from the Encrypted event. I can just make you one for free, hmu
---
I thought it was a boar for a minute and got dummy excited
---
It is an exploit with the fo1 tent
---
When I first read the title of this thread, all I could think of was 'Starbucks collectron'.
---
Yeah they went the Destiny way with the Legendary Run -- all it does is emphasise how stale a lot of the game is when it forces you to experience it each and every time you play without fomo.
---
Nuke em.
---
Did you installed it the right way or just copied it over to the new laptop? And which platform/launcher are you using?
---
AFAIK its intentional cause it was the way to get gomode.
---
Did you try taking off your armor first?
---
There's one planned and it's on the roadmap(I think.)
---
Happened to me once in a couple of weeks ago with the exception that there wasn't a ramp. It took me a few minutes to phase through the door as the door ledge is pretty small...
---
Well you can. Its only $1.
---
If you can't afford that you need to set your priorities right and sort your financial situation out real quick.
---
Ah it's the skin then thank you
---
Also no its anywhere even in my private world, any place they will spawn between 20-40 and very rarely a level 50 in the mix which of sad because I don't want to farm xp on it because low level legendary drops, all typical high level legendary/xp spots
---
I got a bloodied 25% faster fire rate combat rifle from a ghoul at Whitesprings a few months back. I've only ever gotten trash from the SBQ/boss fights.
---
What area were you in?
---
It’s noticeably harder because in 4 you start with all your special, so you can have a decent intelligence score when you start, but in 76 you need to augment it with perks and chems before higher levels make it easier
---
Now that you mention it, 3* Fireproof. I wasn't aware it completely negated E damage, did it always?
---
I've just tested it on, no damage whatsoever (card says -45%). Taken off, I'm taking damage again.
---
Scorchbeast Saddles sound great but this idea's half-baked :p
---
It might have fallen out of bounds, or at least out of reach. Magazines have physics enabled on them so they can get tossed around and moved out of their original spawn point.
---
That's not right then. Even in Cranberry Bog and Fissure sites?
---
Yeah. I understand people who like to melt the queen in seconds but that's not my style.
---
The grown-ups realize that no matter how much they polish the turd it'll still end up a a dumpster fire mess
---
A real Easter egg would have a small bowl of petunias next to it.
---
FLAMING CHAINSAW
---
In all seriousness it’s the most fun weapon and anyone who says otherwise Is dumb
---
When I run it I've never had any damage from my own gun (unless it's a legacy)
---
It's the 45% with your ER or DR(can't remember), which makes you take no damage. Pretty handy if you ask me
---
Unless they are Raven, Deathclaw,  Strange man, or Old Man Winter they barely have value. I gave away a ton to level 10s to 20s at the Wayward after Fasnacht ended.
---
I'm only new myself right now and don't have heaps of resources to spare, but when I do I'm gonna hang around Vault 76and help noobs because of the few high-level players who helped me... on day one of me playing, this one guy gave me lots of stimpaks and rad-x and rad-away and some plans to get me started and took time to chat with me and answer some questions! The community has definitely been great and I'm enjoying it!
---
Best commando weapon yes.
---
I think I get it one in ten attempts
---
I know about that, that not a news. She was teleporting out of the zone, while nuked
---
Why am I hearing grahm say that instead of a robot?
---
The problem with it being set to your time zone, as it says in the song, it’s 5 o’clock somewhere. It just wouldn’t be manageable in game
---
You can tame things to have as pets. Only problem is they run off every couple of weeks.
---
I used to be naive like you,but then i took a griefer in the knee.
---
I know Xbox Series X or whatever its called us suppose to let you play all your old games on it whether or not they upgrade the game for next gen.
---
Only from your extractors and typically they do it once then leave 
---
More inconvenient as you need to replace the lock if anything
---
I have the feeling that this might be the case since it would not be the only magazine that is glitched or stuck, but I have searched many times and I just threw a grenade at it and that didn't seem to work. With other magazines I can find on the internet if there is something wrong with the spawning place but I couldn't find that either
---
I've tried now; with no Fireproof or armor (but +50 ER Scaly Skin), ~23% HP damage from one shot. Without any armor, ~13% HP with one shot. With one piece on (even just +15 ER from underarmor) it goes down to ~3%. Another armor piece after that and all damage is negated.
---
Looks like it's just normal then, sorry—maybe I changed one of these things recently and never noticed until now. I used to cripple and even kill myself all the damn time shooting anything that got close, so this is a shock.
---
Get wanted, bait them, destroy their whole camp with a mirv and chainsaw
---
I was level 10 and someone dropped me marine wet-suit and tactical helmet plans. I'm level 46 now and haven't found them in game yet. Now I just make the marine wetsuit and the upgraded version of it for new players and sell them for 25 caps at my vendor.
---
This. 45%. Plus your armour. Plus stats give u a little boost and if your chest is modded as well. I run 1 fire proof and dense mod. Can explode cars and nothing

---
Just try at any point and it doesn't work?
---
Stuff like scorch beasts and queen/behemoth are the only exception but anything like super mutants or scorched ghouls etc etc doesn't spawn the levels they should
---
I don't have a job, and the pandemic isn't helping.
---
And it needs to be limb dmg than?
---
The time zone thing isn’t as important as what I was really meaning, with everyone knowing when they can log in to play at the in game time they want for maximum benefit
---
Can be done with a team, just occupy the normal spawn locations with a player and the npcs will be forced to spawn elsewhere.
---
If you’re new it’s unlikely you have anything to steal from besides water collectors
---
Some camps can be placed on mounds of resource and you can build a collector onto it, likewise the shop has robots that collect things. All these can be locked in edit mode. Players can pick the lock and get wanted and take from it. 
---
Doesn’t happen often as it’s a lot more hassle than it’s worth. You also don’t really lose much because the collector has a weight limit.
---
Unlocked collectors can be taken from freely so you can leave them unlocked if you want to let people take as they wish
---
Why where you prepared with a tesla?

How do I install Minecraft mods?
---
ive got a rig with a rtx 2080 and no issues with lag, even my gaming laptop with a gtx 1070i i use when away is fine
---
I don’t play with power armor much do some of my perks won’t apply to you since they are dependent on not using power armor. My one suggestion would be make concentrated fire one star only. I never saw any increase with more stars. 
---

---
Dead game
---
Any effects active in your stats ? (Flamer floater etc?)
---
My PC game has improved a great deal with various ini tweaks that I got off this forum. I did play it for a long time with lag and stuttering so it is possible to improve performance if you put the effort in. Seems to just be badly optimised in the first place.
---
Yeah I use a bloody build that's why I know how Op it is there is about nothing in the game that i can't kill in about 5 seconds
---
Yes.  Up to three failed attempts, I can exercise patients.   When it hits five, frustration sets in.
---
Paydirt. Now bag that stuff and hang tight
---
Theres a few fossilised whale parts you can see in the layers of sediment rock leading up to top of the worlds from the train station too
---
That makes perfect sense, thanks for the explanation.
---
Plus there are some thirsty ass achievement hunters out there now.
---
It's kinda funny murdering them though.
---
They're so naive and unaware of the incredibly broken meta this game supports
---
How do you even play unbloodied?
---
Well that sucks, glad I've yet to experience it but I'm sure my time will come
---
I third heavies and love your explanation for each one, nice little chuckle to start the day
---
Most users wouldn’t pay for mods really anyway
---
I got a single peice of 3 star SS armor they day of the patch, everything else after has been pitchforks, baseball bats, and mutant slayers armor, all 1 star.
---
Any perk shared? Cool. No perk shared? Cool. It don’t matter much to me.
---
I think these vault raids will be "Daily OPs" if I'm not wrong
---
I got gifted plans for ultracite armour during my first visit to Morgantown,
---
And? You still get things out of it.
---
So u got mad u can’t glitch anymore?
---
Sounds like it's a combo of natural armor resistance plus either Fireproof or Dense mod. I had no idea they made that much of a difference or stacked that way.
---
I’m now 25 tracked events and 1 drop.
---
Yes but the coding would need to be altered for every time zone so it wouldn’t work
---
I'm not sure but I've never really suffered any lag or stuttering on One S
---
As far I know limb damage and bashing damage is bugged right now.
---
Limb damage works fine from range, but require a high fire rate. Bashing damage only needs close combat where you would be able to hit the enemy with a bash. 
---
instigating is the best modifier so far I can tell, but I heard bloodied, junky and everything else should work fine aswell. The two major modifier are essential. 
---
The trick with my instigating limb damage minigun is the high fire rate combined with the shredder attachment, when I shoot the sbq midair I deal significant damage, melting her hp slower but faster then I would with a bloodied explo gatling plasma. When she lands and I am in melee range she dies within a few seconds.
---
Nuke ATLAS Observatory 🥳
---
You made me watch it and I agree! It's so fucking jittery and laggy and the moment when she tried to jump up to her team at the start, failed, and then ran around the long way was hilarious. What the fuck were they doing with all their builds at half health??
---
Robot Voice: It's a story of... er... real desperation... er....
---
I'm surprised the total raised bar didn't start moving backwards as they played it...
---
Sometimes you need to wait around for a bit for it to load
---
Dollhouses have existed for hundreds of years. If one person builds a C.A.M.P. that looks like a dollhouse, they hardly have the "rights" to that type of build.
---
Having said that, are you saying that the C.A.M.P. looked like a dollhouse, or are you saying that it was an exact copy of another build? If it simply looked like a dollhouse, then what exactly is the issue with it? If, however, it was build as a copy of someone else's build, wherein the rooms are the same, with the same objects in them, using the same wallpapers, and so on, then you could call it "ripped" from someone else's build.
---
Would be nice to have some links to images showing the two builds that you're referring to.
---
There are a few bridges fitting that description by the powerplant. The power plant in the forest/ash heap I mean
---
get their mobile phone number and put up a add for a cheap iphone 8 with it
---
What I’m trying to say is the timescale should be modified to where 1hour in game is 1hour out of game so everyone knows what time it is in game
---
Yes it has. AND ITS WORSE THAN BEFORE!
---
You will get a non-legendary lvl 30 Fixer for completing the quest line. You have a chance at getting the Fixer Plan for completing the event that requires the key card you get for completing the quest line.
---
This is the fo76 sub
---
I hate the fast travel bug
---
Beckett is ok. I made him a little  bungalow with his bar far away from my main camp so its usually fine. Usually.
---
Why are people downvoting? Pretty sure this comment is relevant
---
he didn't, though?   
---
 "Everyone of those developers sounded and had the body language like they had been in psychic treatment. "  
---
where exactly is the op mocking their physical appearance here? he's talking about the way they acted and presented themselves on the stream, calm down with your moral high horse attitude lol
---
Flamethrower trap.
---
It’s a better combat rifle. It uses combat rifle mods, does a little more damage than a combat rifle and has “baked in” 2 minor legendary effects, faster movement while aiming and improved sneaking. However, if you have peed demon, I understand that first effect to be worthless.
---
Im using Steam and did a fresh install
---
It was...weird. Eerie. Different to most fallout games where you tended to bump into npcs out and about doing their own thing.
---
Only dead bodies, holotapes, and robots. Not even any human enemies.
---
Snitches tear their britches.
---
Simple workaround thanks to another bug: keep fast traveling nearby. Soon she will spawn next to you.
---
Just a couple of dummy thicc stealy bois
---
More atoms? Not gonna happen...
---
The whole idea of this Legendary run thing is to decrease amount of free atoms people get.
---
Agreed if you feel you've got your money's worth, there is no need to think about refunds. No exploits are of use to me, I'm a Vampire tank build in ESO and F76 PVP, so there's very little I'd need after 2 years play, as I'm locked to weapons and armour I like, and stimpacks are a no need, that's the main thing people exploit for. But there are many viable refundable traits i.e character freezes, loss of items which hold a lot of weight should anyone need a refund on a recent purchase
---
High intelligence Special stat, boiled scorch brain or the relish, 4 people in building team, inspirational perk, and the perk which increases mutations by 25 percent if team mates have them, well rested or lovers embrace, canned meat stew and a disgusting amount of line in the sand, scorched earth, guided meditation and encrypted events :-(
---
Will have to try on a private server. If I ever get bored enough to log in again...
---
I noticed that used to happen but it hasn't happened to me lately so I thought it was patched. Thanks!
---
Already have been hoarding it
---
Probably, why didn’t you scrap all these for the cork?
---
insert donald trump wrong gif here
---
Posts like these make me think about switching to the dark side and use my pvp character against everyone who isnt on my friend list.
---
If you guys are so jealous, that you have to call someone a bastard and want to destroy his game by reporting him and hoping to get him banned just because he exploits the ammo machine glitch, simply do it yourself. You will feel better.
---
It is probably the most buggy game I ever played.
---
Quite often I will see some headless scorched which seems to be alive, but are standing still and can't be killed.
---
Also, sometimes some weapon types get unusable and unequip automatically everytime you try to equip. When that happens I need to log out and log in again, to make them work
---
It's quite funny when you go to any deathclaw spawn there's a mound of unclaimed junk/loot from people just popping them and moving on.
---
Well, a grind is a grind if you treat it as grind, meaning, if you rush everything before everything actually  needs to be done. It's a choice, if it's awful, it's on you.
---
It's like buying a bag of candies for the week  and eating everything in one day ;)
---
I feel this so much. Im almost embarrassed to tell my friends enjoy playing this game. But I'll never stop loving it. And with every little flaw and absolute fuck up they make there will still always be hope that this game will be an amazing experience at the end of the road.
---
21
---
If there’s a locked door or safe in an area that is also a workshop, when someone claims it, those become theirs and picking them will make you wanted. Red just means it was player created.
---
Indeed. It gives me sense of power
---
Yeah.  Then those who cheated back at start would have loads by now.
---
They won't do this.
---
When everyone wants to be the one who deals the most damage nobody is on the lookout to support and defend the team. Exactly why Bloodied needs to be put in check so that this damage trash meta gets replaced with balanced gameplay. What's the cost of a couple dozen stimpacks compared to seeing everyone succeed; people are greedy. I'm sick and tired of these days of one shotting or melting high tier bosses instantly or within a minute; 76 was much better pre-bloodied.
---
You’re starting to come awfully close to describing some of our real life rural neighbors.
---
Its my fav quest.
---
I got 100.
---
I did dailies. Weeklies.  Even double score weekend helped.
---
Also some skips.
---
It was possible from launch to now to reach 100.
---
So why complain about being good at the game? If you want a challenge run a different build. Jesus, people want to bitch about whatever they can.
---
Yeah and then some poor time zone \*cough cough\* Australia will always be playing whens its the middle of the night on servers while in principle it's a nice concept in actuality it hurts those who can only play at a set time each day (eg after work) I know I for one wouldn't like to play the rest of fallout 76s day by pipboy light
---
But, but... the 3k caps or 250 gold! Oh my, would be a shame if I couldn't grind for something I easy can obtain within one day...
---
Don't forget all the basic repair kits aswell, time to destroy my advanced one!
---
( /s for any stupid idiot who don't know sarcasm these days....)
---
I downloaded this game 2 weeks ago and I love it so much. I’ve never played any other fallout and only started playing because of my girlfriend. I played this everyday so far and it’s surprising to see that a lot of people are bashing it for a lack of content. It feels like there’s so much to do that could keep me busy for months. Aside from the glitches, I really enjoy the content and the community.
---
Probably just a typo, but to make sure its 20 treasury notes you can turn in each day granting 200 gold.
---
The grind were even worse in closed beta, they used to let us turn in only 10 each day.
---
i've had up to three of them at a time chasing me around. that's an old bug that's been around since skyrim at least  =]
---
Yeah it's a typo my bad!
---
I personally can't complain about the fireworks, the most OP throw-able in the game.
---
One thing to do with useless rewards for a high level is to claim them on a 2nd character so when you start out you have lots of stuff.  This doesn't apply to scrap kits which are essentially useless.
---
Another thing to do with basic repair kits is to use them on random items for the "Repair 76..." Challenges.
---
As far I know the rewards are available for free at the atomshop, once phase 1 is completed on 11th of August.
---
Quakecon discount is up for the game. 
---
Game is buggy but relatively playable. 
---
Bloodied builds are meta, has more benefit than disadvantages. 
---
Buy from steam, refund while you can if you do not like the game after playing. 
---
Fallout 1st is a premium subscription and optional. 
---
While I do play the game, it is not a game for everyone. 
---
Watch steamers for more information.
---
Or. You could trade your monster for a halfway decent legendary fixer
---
Ur on pc?
---
Not again...
---
.... Buy it?
---
I took one look at Encryptid, said no thanks and coughed up the 9k (actually traded items of equivalent value, but that is an avg cost). I strongly recommend you do the same my friend or you'll go insane.
---
No im on ps4
---
How did it cure your mutations?  U don’t run starched genes?
---
Wait so we're still gonna have to donate steel till then too? It doesn't just update when we actually reach (Or overreach) the goal?
---
If you don't do a noticeable amount of damage on the SBQ, 1000 points ist the figure we think is the threshold, you will not get any loot and you will not be in on the kill table.
---
If you are not in on the kill table, you simply didn't kill the SBQ and thus this kill does not count for you.
---
Then I can't help, sorry
---
Xbox if you like Nuclear Winter, PC otherwise.
---
I would've stopped playing if not for some of the mods(inventory, muting explosive bullets, no ATX landing page on launch).
---
You can make the game run better with tweaks as others have mentioned
---
No, you reach the steel goal, you move on to the next thing. the actual rewards will show up at once on the 11th.
---
I think Bethesda is really focussed on Starfield, the new Elder Scrolls and next generation consoles. Fallout 76, ESO and sales from older games are what's keeping them afloat. The dev team for Fallout 76 has to be a small team and they're doing what they can with the tools they're given. And maybe to them, it's just a job as well. Not every game developer is a passionate gamer that puts in 80% of their available time into development.
---
And frankly, they don't owe me anything more either. I paid for the game back in the day, paid two F1st subs, bought a few atoms and got over 400 hours of entertainment back. That's an awesome deal if I say so myself. Anything they add on top of this is just icing on the cake.
---
Nocturnal only need a single fix.
---
Increased damage/resistance at night. 
---
NO (zero) decrease during day. simple
---
We are about 100 million over the steel goal and haven't moved on.
---
Im on 86 it was a side product of maxing out my xp gain and playing with good friends alot. I been trying to prepare for legendary perks. I gain atleast 1-3 levels a day when i was only gaining a level 2-3 days xp wise. It hasnt really felt like a grind to me but its a side thing. Since the season started i gained 80 xp levels and now up to 418.
---
You need the starched genes perk.
---
Im at work right now, but we should be supposed to donate something else.
---
I think there are 4 different resources, each time gated for 24h. No need to donate BTW, the counter on the homepage is automated and is not tied to the ingame donations. It fills anyway, no matter if nothing or 50000mio scrap gets donated.
---
can u have your stuff?
---
err?
---
What platform are you on and what mutation do you need ?
---
i spent at least 10K before a kind player (greggmason920 4 president) gave them plans to me for free
---
LOL 🤣
---
Bethesda!
---
I'm guilty of this, got ff7 remake but felt I had to get seasons out the way first, will be nice a quick break
---
But that was the highlight of my entire day. Wondering where Ward was and how messed up I'd find him
---
Hmm maybe but it’s like insanely rare to get it and I like to collect stuff so I might think about it
---
I have it but I was completely unaware that those doors that heal radiation also cure mutations.
---
I guess lesson learned.
---
I was in game 5 minutes ago, it's still steel. I donated some to make sure.
---
Actually, put me down for some of this action.
---
I'm also on PS4 and wouldn't mind some of that sweet junk and scrap you have just sitting there. I'll take it off your hands.
---
Not too fussed about weapons or armor, but I'll take a Furious FFR Gatling Gun if anyone has one.
---
If you're quitting, don't let shit go to waste. Gimme. 👍🏻
---
I can has my stuph k thx
---
And my axe!
---
Only 150 flux? You need a different target .)
---
eg Hemlock holes will net you roughly 500 raw cobalt flux. Check mapalachia where the concentration for your desired flux is highest.
---
For stabilizing agents I haven't found one that better and faster to farm than WS.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events
---
We should get the rewards once project alpha is done.
---
Worst case we get them at the very ending, or never.
---
I don't think we got the PTS build for the latest patch. To many things have been changed or broken that weren't happening on the PTS.
---
the plan drops in the new meat week so we should have legit legendary ones soon enough
---
I think a lot console players would pay for Perk load-outs. they would gripe, there would be youtube videos but they would pay.
---
A smaller thing that is a mod/simple INI edit is changing the pip boy color, I'm sure Bethesda would get away with a 100 Atom price for each color.
---
If you have starched genes at top rank it doesn't.
---
Just relax with trying to meta the game and play our own way, don't follow the herd.
---
I meant addictions, my bad
---
You have level 2 starched genes equipped and the decon shower got rid of your mutation?
---
Well usualy if you have the ( maxed) perk equipped even the rad shower things wont heal Mutations.
---
I only had this issue once and that was because i swapped the genes Thing with super duper and forgot to swap back afterwards.
---
Excellent idea - another reward for all the hard work put in by those who contributed, happily accepted those those who didn't.
---
Or...change the reward setup to encourage participation and then add extras.
---
PC playing on gamepass version
---
Thats why I always swap class freak with super duper. Just in case because I'm very forgetful and I have like 5 mutations
---
Explosive bait needs to be fixed so it's useless outside the specific quest.  
---
Griefing another players CAMP should not be possible in Adventure Mode, ever.  
---
FFS If players want PvP, they should go play in NW.
---
Yes I can have my stuff!
---
I started to experience this lately as well. And I've noticed it seemingly has something to do with the combat state you're in, because to me it only happens when I'm in the Caution state when I'm stealthing. When I move away from the combat region a bit, then I can fast travel again. I'm not saying this is exactly the cause, but this is my experience at least.

TL;DR: if you can't fast travel, move away a few yards to a safer area. Maybe that'll help.

Works of your game tag

In seeing it a lot more too along with im have g loads is cheap, in my opinion, deaths was doing AWOL earlier today and the Custsy blow up I was no where near him and dead. Got hit by a scratched dead with blocker and iron-clad on dead and strangely got hit by a high level goul and didn't die was above 20/percent health in both cases.
---
Yep, now im also doing this. One time mistake i guess 😂

---
You looking for a Fixer plan?
---
You want one? Got any 50cal or 5mm ammo spare? Will gladly trade for all 50cal and 5mm you got.
---
That’s maybe probably because the deadline for steel is today, and the next material unlocks on Sunday??? Idk man seems pretty easy to read the dates to me
---
always wanted fallout to be dark as metro with no foolishness. said foolishness is unbearable in 76, plushies hugs and kisses. its like all the dorks in the entire world band together for the colors of the rainbow. here have a gift where it should be full blown pvp with  a chainsaw stained with blood snd hair.
---
No, i have the perk but usually i equip it when a need to take some radaway.
---
But this time I forgot that's why it made me feel really dumb.
---
It has not worked the last two times I've done it. Tents placed in the right spots, everyone facing the sonic generator, but the scorched just coming in from the road regardless.
---
The game has as many frame rates as expected
---
https://youtu.be/YPN0qhSyWy8
---
Ahh happens to the best of us. Sucks when it does though
---
Plenty of time
---
Not in public events though.
---
Built the ammo converter, used once, scrapped to save build budget.
---
Just another way for Bethesda to break something
---
Yes, you can have your stuff.
---
I like the grind but I wish they would stop trying to force us on to N/W. That game mode is shit
---
Starched jeans perk card at higher level, only use diluted radaway and radx.
---
I’m calling post apocalypse PETA. There’s a case of deathclaw abuse
---
Getting one with Quad would be a lot of fun
---
So true!
---
Did I make a grammer error and not notice cause I don't understand why people are commenting keeping or giving stuff, but I don't mind
---
I can't wait for Captainoob to roast the balls off the dev team for not fixing the Queen.
---
They were probably just dropping their junk at your camp hahah
---
Anything like that would just be put with fallout 1st
---
Greetings from the "mutants explosive 90%lw gatling gun" User.
---
The bulldozing has been severely curtailed several patches ago.
---
You guys can basically answer all of your own questions with how you're responding, yes, money.
---
People are still playing the game regardless of the bugs, dupers that got their accounts back after making huge farewell and 'fuck-you's' posts towards bethesda came back and are still playing, and people are still paying for stuff on the atom shop...
---
Think about the amount of people who play the game who don't use reddit/facebook and read all the negative stuff all day (my wife being one of them).
---
Some of us play the game to enjoy a Fallout experience that can be shared with others and just deal with the bugs and keep playing because of the experience we're having.
---
So this is not where I should mention I bought a plan the other day that the player had listed at 1/10th of the face value (18 caps) :).
---
Fun fact: Jim Jones didnt use Koolaid. It was Grape Flavor Aid
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavor_Aid
---
We can fix this game with a few ghoul penises and rolling pins, I belive in this cause
---
I'd say the daily dungeons from the winter season are more likely
---
Youth sins always slap back later in life. 😂
---
Welcome to Reddit, unfortunately lol.
---
I posted a harmless video of my 5 year old playing WoW for the very first time and it was like 85% up voted.
---
15% of people literally down voted because my 5 year old was keyboard turning her first time touching a computer.
---
I do score nearly every day but ignore NW, level up (unless it happens with normal play) and legendary.  I just don’t seem to be able to find that many legendaries.  Good places outside of event(and the one shot brigade) would be appreciated.
---
I bought one for 2.5k, then another for 285 fusion cells and a handful of fusion cores....
---
Then sold one for 5.5k 😅 they're not hard to come by if you just hop around everyone's vendors
---
Easy money maker aswell if you can find em cheap!
---
The issue is not the bloodied build but the lack of other viable build.
---
In the same boat. Ive got about 900 hours play time. Main a gunslinger and have the best of the best gear for my build, j5025,j2525,je25,ve25 x2, westerns ,10mms and about 50 other rolls in my stash with a damn near perfect SS armor set. Lately i find myself logging in,cashing in what scrip i have, looking at the challeneges ,than just staring at my map before saying screw it an logging off. This is one of my favorite games of all time, but im just bored right now.
---
Taking a break untill new content comes. Im rwally looking forward tk the one wasteland stuff, i need a reason to explore the map more and not farm the same spots/events...over..and over...and over... Started playing red dead online again and im really enjoying it. Only downside is when i hope on 76 i miss the rdr2 graphics man that game is beautiful.
---
Have gone to do SBQ a few times and ppl are just standing around shooting at nothing. Then 15-20 seconds later she appears and ppl are in different places and such. Very annoying since I have gigabit internet
---
Are you creeping up on it from behind? They certainly don't like that. No no no. You have to approach them from the front at a certain pace. Keep some intervals in your steps so they can acclimate themselves to your presence. Always keep your intentions clear. And then gently, ever so gently press the milk button.
---
Works everytime.
---
Your title; "So I heard some of Y'all are quiting, can u have your stuff?"
---
I didn’t even create the random account tho, it just kinda appeared😅
---
I wouldn't bother with video games than.
---
Calendars are hard to read
---
Pretty much the same way as before, but you put whatever wall down, destroy it with the flamer trap, and while its still broken, place the other wall facing the opposite direction. Once done, repair the broken wall and you have your double sided wall again. Bit of a hassle compared to before, but at least its something
---
You would have some bat and pumpkin themed gun skins and a glow in the dark skeleton costume from the Halloween rewards. The Christmas has a metal armor skin with snow flakes, a winter hat with flames, and a fur lined coat. If you have the fur coat and the skeleton you should also have every other reward since those were last to unlock.
---
Bahahaahahahha.... nice.
---
Probably a duped plan
---
Yeah they're around dude. Also, get on the Discord trade servers and buy direct from inventory from someone. There's actually heaps around.
---
Holy shit boss go enjoy ff7 and the twists it has in it. Seems like they did a amazing job if they keep it going with the next ones.
---
I've never had people greifing me since the start on xbox, I do have pacifist mode on most of the time mind so they can waste their ammo as much as they like, at lvl 120 now and always helping new players and have been helped lots of times, in my experience its these players that make the game for me, and the bugs &amp;glitches "just work" so I barely notice them anymore.
---
Or they frag his ass for being in their claimed base. Or for his hat. Because its dangerous and shouldnt fall into the wrong hands.
---
RDR2 is a fantastic game, highly recomend it. If you do check out videos on youtube about adjusting your controls, i think i have pics of my settings on my phone if you DM me i can send them via imgur link. Changing them makes the game feel way better.
---
Yeah, I'm not going to bother with that perk.
---
Take a break play other games?
---
When I did my first female character I had a guy follow me from the vault to flatwoods, killing everything after I'd tagged it and 'protecting' me for about an hour and a half. He was telling me where to go and stuff over mic. I went along with it even tho I had about 600 hours on my main at this point. He must have been heartbroken when I logged off and thanked him over mic with my deep voice
---
Even without the sent, the damage mitigation from the perks and mutations should be sufficient.
---
Community: please fix the multitude of problems 
---
Bethesda: U GET PETS NOW THO
---
I think it looks cool. I have a complete SS set but balked at the helmet. I have just today collected enough gold for the helmet - do you recommend it?
---
Looks amazing, just hoping in the next few they introduce free roam a bit just so younger players get the experience of diving in a sub to have emerald weapon just floating in front of them about to deal the pain
---
I hope that was a joke. No one is invincible these days, sans cheating
---
I used to, but weight reduction and damage perks are also important to me. Besides, with a full secret service set I've got about 400 DR and ER.
---
That's a pretty sweet rolling pin though, those legendary effects go together really well.
---
Then im clueless. Sorry bro 😂
---
The event is secretly a commentary on the state of healthcare and general lack of social services in the US. Not everyone contributes, and not everyone who contributes does so equally, yet an entire society benefits.
---
Sadly, I have a different experience. I am constantly harassed and killed by high level players while doing the workshop and event daily challenges, even tho Im just trying to mind my own business. Team mates dont help, just looking on. Harassed also while on the road by high lvl people who have little to gain by it. 
---
Ive since completely isolated myself, rarely join teams, demolished my big manor and the shop and live in an abandoned train car...
---
That was hilarious to watch, thanks.
---
She looks completely used to it. Ah just a part of the game lol.
---
What did he say lol?
---
It isn’t a random account, it’s an issue between Steam and Bethesda. Look around on this sub a bit, you’ll find answers for yourself.
---
Yes, even the people who didn't donate will get a reward.
---
One star quad single action revolver
---
Oh, heh
---
If not atoms bullion, caps, scrip, hell even ammo points.
---
I need to run enough points in both Strength and Perception so I can max out the Heavy Gunner and Rifleman perks. Of course, that means having fewer points in other Specials but it's worth the flexibility of being able to be effective in a couple of play styles.
---
There are pets, that's what the animal friend perk gets you.
---
yes. It has a very low drop rate
---
Your reward is relaxing and not worrying about score challenges.. That's better than doing chores everyday.
---
No, being bloodied is not an excuse, it s easy to take a pilon and pop a stimpak from time to time. I m bloodied myself and even 2 pilons is managable with only stimpaks, after that supers or quantums are the way to go.
---
If you don t take a pilon and just hang around waiting for others to do it, you are just selfish and useless and don t have your place in this event. It's a public event, everyone gotta do his job.
---
I can totally see it from a role playing perspective. We’re in a world with numerous hazards, containing giant, winged monsters that literally scream apart anything that catches their attention. It does make the huge mansions, or sprawling compounds littered with neon signs, feel kind of daft. OP is just one of those people who wants more options like torn/old wallpaper, half-destroyed walls, random junk piles etc, and it’s a shame that those things have been almost entirely neglected. 
---
Personally, my camp is a small cabin with a couple of shitty metal shacks nearly for workbenches etc. It’s not sloppy, though, as I put some thought into everything, but it is definitely low-rent.
---
So what would it be worth
---
Well im afffected by it all the damn time.
---
Read what you typed but slower.
---
Interesting that the software that Nexus promotes (Vortex) and allegedly supports 76... doesn't work.
---
Thanks, figured I have to do it manually.
---
Stupid Nexus.
---
If I was quitting I'd give you my stuff - but I ain't quitting 😂
---
I know! Its great fun isnt it?
---
Whats even better is when the countdown timer goes from 15 seconds to 1 second and then cancels. Thats brilliant.
---
There's a lot of number string players around and I'm pretty sure it's a Steam account issue to do with display names and how Bethesda implemented the Steam version of the game.  
---
I hope Beth fix it and am sure they're aware of the issue, but please do ring and complain as the more people do complain, the sooner a fix will occur.
---
Neither am I good sir
---
God damnit, I had forgotten that until you reminded me. A true gamer™ moment.
---
Woosh
---
If you watched any part of the stream, you would have seen that she is playing with the devs here.
---
It would be nice if the extra score could be credited to the next season
---
Evidently, changing a literal number in the code as to how often those lines are repeated is just too much for the devs right now. Better to focus on photo frames and the like.
---
They also said we could connect camps and make our own settlements too iirc
---
I think that was the point. There has to be done way to nerf bloodied. Also everything else needs to be buffed to bring everything more in line - otherwise one wasteland and future content will be pretty shit, either to easy for bloodied or too hard for almost everyone else.
---
Yeah it’s a really old song, back to 1946, Merle Travis. 
---
The best known version by Tennessee Ernie Ford is more rhythmic than the Cash version. https://youtu.be/RRh0QiXyZSk
---
Not my area of expertise but i wouldnt be surprised if youd get 10k plus for it
---
Weeklies and dailies have been scaling up with my rank. I'm at 84? And my weeklies have me 5K, while the dailies are dropping 2.5K SCORE.
---
Gambling is what the purveyor is for.
---
"how do I find things on the internet?"
---
Type words corresponding to what you want to find into Google and hit enter. C'mon, man. 🙄
---
Better return to nuke zones every 15 mins. I get 50 stable flux inb1 nuke that way
---
I've been trying to help people out myself lately... Like going to camps of people level 25-30 and dropping a dozen full fusion cores next to their stash boxes because I remember what it was like back when I was that level (2 weeks ago lol) and doing runs for a handful of partially used cores just to keep my excavator armor going for the +100 carry weight bonus. It SUUUUUUUCKS. But now I've got so many full cores that my stash has hardly any room for junk until I resub to Fo1st that I've just been giving the dang things away.
---
Yeh it’s a great exploit for farming XP. I don’t have 1st, but the couple times it’s happened for me it was so much easier than when the level 300 dickheads one hit everything so you don’t get XP.
---
That happened to me me too it was bizarre I was quite low level then so I thought it was part of the game I was missing 😆
---
The point is it's a community goal. In other games that have had community goals it usually has an impact in the game world, but this is a little different in that the game world progression will happen regardless, but the community will receive gifts instead.  
---
Socialism and Communism at work.
---
'a friend' 
---
uhu
---
You don't have to do NW. Complete the xp repeatable challenge 3 times and that covers the NW SCORE.
---
GTFO
---
Why I don't like NW that much either, I don't think one small daily challenge out of 6 others is actually forcing you to go to NW. I mean place your camp 1-3 times is the easiest you can do. I don't play NW, but for that free score I just go solo, place camps and quit, can't be easier than that.
---
You  caught the Super Mutant strain of Herpes... If your gunna romp around WestTek you gotta wear a hazmat.
---
I suspected it. :-/
---
It should have worked like any other currency. Sell ammo to a vendor for the new currency and the vendor should have all ammo for sale using the same currency. Give him like 9,999,999 of each type and reset every day just in case.
---
That is why you always fight at V9. I don't even bother doing the event if the queen is at Glassed Cavern.
---
Same! That is a very alarming sound &amp; does not match the activity it is attached to!
---
Ahhh
---
Look... games shouldn't be like an endless source of repeatable pleasure. That's not enjoying a game, its being /addicted/ to a game. The end game is there for people to grind between major content releases, if they feel like it, its not there to be continuously playable forever, and to be honest, any end game that repeats the same content over and over is always going to get boring --- the expectation is that you'll wane off and then come back when something new is released. I stopped playing for the longest time and came back for wastelanders -- I never did any end game content before and now the only reason I'm doing it is to make sure I have an ammo machine and some decent loadout for the next story content release (BoS).
---
I'd run out of all other ammo
---
I’m mainly a rainbow six siege player and i play ranked a lot but i recently started playing FO76 because of the game pass and this game was super relaxing to me and my friends. We didn’t feel the nervous anxiety and pressure like we did in rainbow to clutch a round or win a match. The learning curve on rainbow is high and frankly i never cared about new players as a matter of fact i would see noobs as a hinderance. But within the first day in FO76 an act of kindness happened with me and my friends from a lvl 102 dropping us loads of plans and ammo. Now my group of 3 is over lvl 100 and we realize that we had no idea on how to ideally build our characters until we reached like level 70. Now we have unique character builds, (melee build, bow build, and rifle build) and we try to sell everything at a price lower than 25 caps including higher value stuff like ultracite armor plans because we wanted to help everyone else out as well. We also drop stims and ammo for new players (also plans when we have too many in our stash). However this week i came across my first group of toxic players who were jumping from camp to camp in the lobby and destroying camps with grenades. I was afk when they attacked me but my friends were crafting when they started attacking. when i came back i saw that everything was destroyed and i was dead, but i was more upset that they hit the camps of new lower lvl people. My friends kept dying because it was a 4v2 situation but they tried fast traveling after them to help prevent them from destroying other peoples camps and after they hit everyone they left the server. I tried rebuilding people’s stuff but that shouldn’t be an experience for lower lvls to get destroyed by lvl 200+ players. I don’t mind it if it’s myself getting destroyed. i mean out of my group i deal the most damage and i have had PvP encounters even solo when I’m claiming workshops already so i know what to expect. Not to mention i don’t care if i lose a junk/scrap bag because i have more than enough resources I’m merely just hoarding like a dragon at this point. But don’t bully the lower lvls they’re just joining the game and don’t need to experience it in a toxic way that could make em lose interest in FO76. It’s an enjoyable game with a lot of content and it’s been super enjoyable for me. I only want to keep that positive thing going.
---
There’s a nerf, then there’s completely neutering it. This is neutering every single Bloodied sneak build.
---
Yes I’ve moved her to the outer limit of my camp and can still hear her in the customise option there should be a mute button!
---
This has been around since a while
---
Press b for 2 second
---
Yes, for craft fluxs you Need material, in a round I can get about 15 radiation fluids Moré or less
---
Yeah but the slot machine is where you just crunch legendaries, you don't get to actually play a slot machine. If she was the slot machine, it'd be 10x better.
---
Yeah the guy who dropped the nuke put it in a really weird place, might have been his first run though
---
I don't see any mention of the ghillie suit problems with leather chest and leg armor. I haven't tried them yet, but is it still fucked?
---
I always go for the Deathclaw up on the ridge by WestTek.. its far away enough that nobody camps it and isolated enough that people wont hear its wimpering as I cripple its limps, then cook its meat and absorb its powers.
---
It's been crashing much more some this last patch. Overall performance is worse too. 
---
But when have these games not crashed all the time? It's just what they do.
---
Have you done Waste Management? It’s an after game quest I found by going into the tunnels near Berkeley I think 🤔
---
It's weird that one seems to
---
Hold circle
---
Bos event is to help remove duped junk from inventories and return value to resources kinda like removing caps from us (i.e. fasttravling buying billion and getting taxed on sales) helps keep them valuable
---
"psychic treatment"
---
No, that's not correct.
---
When I was burnt out I limited myself to three events a day. Get on, fast travel to the events, log off. Eventually after enough time, the game starts to feel like a “fallout themed” idle game almost, its started to become a little haven where I could experience some fallout themed action in small bits. After enough time doing this my interest in the rest of the game kind of reset itself and I was ready to dive in deep again✌️
---
more than 40k. it’s a trade only worth a good legacy.
---
He has been soloed by bloodied commando and bloodied heavy gunner from what I've seen from you tubers in the PTS!
---
This!  It would follow the Rocket League season pass idea (others may do it, not sure) where it just randomizes a reward after the max level.  The only challenge may be that it's free versus all the perks for Rocket League having a cost for entry.
---
Certainly not to encourage Bethesda to monetize everything but having a premium track in the next season to go with the regular track wouldn't be a bad idea at the \~$10-15 price point, double the rewards and add more unique cosmetics would actually have value.
---
I love the game, I feel like people find all the little things to complain about. Sure the game has its problems but theres no point writing these big posts about how you're leaving the game. Let's be honest, you're probably not. (wasnt directed at the guy I replied to, directed at the countless 'I'm sick of this game, everyone stop playing posts)
---
HEAR HEAR, WE WANT THE DOGS!
---
Just for the record ESO does not play flawlessly.  Been playing that game since launch and its the same spaghetti code issues over there with new bugs poppinc up every patch and taking too long to fix them.  Not saying you're wrong but ESO has a plethora of it's own problems as well which isn't surprising.  It's been around a lot longer so im sure in a small impression from a livestream it seems good and stable but it really isn't.
---
Dang first thing to happen to me is I got put in a circle of brotherhood nerds all just... staring at me
---
I stopped playing for a while after.
---
Like how the ammo press in the faloout 3 pit works.
---
Do you see an e-mail ingame (main menu - settings - [bethesda.net](https://bethesda.net)) or just that "Buid" bullshit?
---
You think that chart is real? I don't. I stopped wasting steel after the first day, hooray whiskey and boiled water... I'd rather keep the steel. Beth just wants it to look like there's a bunch of engaged players, that's what I think.
---
Side note there is a slot machine in the NW vault 51 lobby area.
---
Price is whatever someone is going to charge for it.... of course it has a price. But there is not right price.
---
You auto learn it from doing the pioneer scout quest where you collect the same insect parts.
---
No, you gamble when you buy the boxes.You literally gamble. You give a certain amount of money and you don't know what kind of price you're going to get.
---
Does int increase xp gain?
---
As Rick may(?) Would say: "ahh, I love the smell of kicked ass in the mornin'"
---
They specifically said in the post they were wondering if it was across all platforms....
---
And servers shut down regularly and stop letting new people in. That’s how they work. Stay on any server long enough and you will get that notice.
---
What if I don't want another hat? Just because one worked for it doesn't mean it has value.
---
did you use the old one
---
Yeah that’s the point? MMO’s are time sinks, and Fallout 76 brings in a lot of elements from MMO games. It’s not meant to be the new direction of the franchise, or one of the normal games that have entertained you for years. You can always go play those, you don’t have to waste your time with 76 if you don’t like it lol.
---
This...  
---
As a professional software developer I wish I had all the power people think devs have.  
---
Managers make the decisions, devs just write the code. If a manager says ship it, it ships, regardless of how hard the devs worked to clear bugs beforehand.
---
I think every customer is important.
---
I mean it takes about 2 hours if you specifically grind for it, or you can do it passively and get it at your own pace. I don’t see an issue.
---
At the line in the sand, radiation rumble and uranium fever, the ash piles from peoples teslas drag my game to a slide show since the last patch, I just have to leave the area and wait for the event to end, get my treasury notes and any reward and leave, no looting for me.
---
When you say recycled content, you mean rewards from events?
---
Same. I noticed it initially with my tent, but it's emotes and loot bags too. Every single time.
---
Are you a possum scout? Have you done the imposter sheep squatch quest line, or the mistress of mystery
---
Unfortunately that doesn't happen indoors.
---
Not that I know of but if I come across anything I'll let you know
---
I played EVERY single day since seasons started and finished every single daily and weekly thus far, excluding some singular NW challenges. Including the xp weekly, I am at level 76 on the pass. I find that to be a lot worse than sacrificing a few days to powerfarm XP. It just shows how this pass was designed to enslave you to force you to log in every day if you expect to reach level 100. And that is absolutely pathetic and disgusting.
---
Many people donated to mod creators through the Nexus website when downloading a mod.
---
Last years event i made a stock and it took a year to sell them all for 300 caps a piece. Its mostly collectors or new people who buy them for a set. This year I lowered the price to 100  and 500 for the more uncommon but I think im going to lower to 300.
---
Ah, you know it's funny, these people, they go to sleep, they  think everything's fine, everything's good... They wake up the next day  and they're on fire.
---
Some do yes but if there was a paywall to start the downloads for those mods would be so much lower
---
You on Xbox?
---
Something about Devann being eye candy and how he wasn't able to focus on the bug, only her. And how lucky we are that she's a CM - "we could've gotten an ugly toad as CM too" lmao.
---
Pathetic.
---
Good luck. I finally got one and I had to trade quite a bit for it.
---
collect all plans, find rare outfits or make a new character with a different build
---
Never mind I see you’re on ps4 I was going to say I bought from someone on here weeks ago for 5k and then very next event I get it to drop. I have had purveyor give me mutants fixer, zealots fixer and her sweet ass gave me a bloodied fixer. But since then I can’t get anything good from her. Spent 600 scrip last night best thing I got was a bloodied hunting rifle
---
Meh I built a dollhouse few months after launch ( as big as I could anyway) I ain’t moaning bout it though , now I just have a massive plantation style mansion and people love it 😊 now I’m seeing mansion style house popping up ... people don’t have imaginations anymore . I’ve heard about these dollhouses and I was doing it way before Bethesda even knew about it , then someone else gets credit ... kinda sucky but there we go ! The game is full of people that steal stuff from other people right ? 
---
Tbh I will say too that I was one on the first people to set up camp on whitespring golf course on PS4 on launch day... I left the vault and got there straight away to find out what it was , then everyone else copied , nuked , and moved all over the place and I was fed up of having my camp moved cuz of other people in whitespring 🙄 I I don’t own whitespring but sucks when the masses just follow trendsetters like sheep 🐑
---
That's not true before the event they were accidently added and many people could craft them. Then they disabled it.
---
I think they meant for it to be charitable then screwed it up, disabled it and then just forgot about it.
---
Everyone seems to be scared to pvp. If I see a wanted player I follow them for a bit then ask their permission before the kill. If they say no I cave their skull in anyway.
---
Shit on Xbox I was killing numerous scorch beasts  last night and if I went somewhere else I could watch the sky and see it fly all the way over to me. Lol always been like this for me. But maybe sometimes it bugs out idk
---
Would be cool if the BOS was interested in exploring the vault. 
---
Like maybe you’ll get a message from them saying “Knight! We’re requesting your assistance at vault 96. Due to your previous efforts a while back in clearing out the place, it seems like the strangler plants have receded. Turns out they were absorbing the radiation from the vaults reactors and using it as food. But now we’ve got a new issue. We sent in an advance team to do some scanning, and it turns out the vault is much bigger than what all of us previously thought, and there’s something filling it with hostiles. There’ll be further briefing at the vault. Ad Victorium.”
---
They could do something similar to GTFO, where you get a series of maps and missions in one level.
---
Don’t use radaway
---
THIS. My god, I have no idea why they removed it in Fallout 4 onwards. And moving holotapes/notes to misc as well? What on Earth were they thinking?
---
Yup :) 
---
https://youtu.be/dS09A4gdt10
---
Sarge does a great video on covering it
---
It’s not that simple as they explained in their response
---
It's the burrows in harpers ferry
---
I feel the community deserves an extrapolation of the anatomically correct Ghouls idea, please, do to on...
---
Bad news, the flamer doesn’t work with friendly fire unless you bash with it.
---
Yeah that’s it thanks you have to click on a sewer drain to get in and start it I quite enjoyed it 🤷🏼‍♀️
---
Yeah it used to happen to me all the time, I thought it was fixed but it got it to work again today thanks to the other commenter, it's so weird
---
[Have a look](https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/51052/~/father-winter-helmet---fasnacht-item---fallout-76)
---
No. Expeditions is a separate thing (and it sounds awesome). Daily Ops are the dungeons.
---
Great. You said this, and then my PS4 decided that FO76 was corrupted and won't let me play until I delete and reinstall. All 70 Gigs. 
---
Not happy.
---
I got my fixer plan from a friendly camp visitor. Just dropped me the plan and ran off.
---
That would be sweet!
---
Ah.. I was kinda hoping score would role over to next season? Give us a wee head start without wasting our time and efforts. But now I see how that was wishful thinking :/
---
a two shot would break twice as fast for only +25% more damage
---
What a creep..
---
Tbf the events page originally said it ended the 7th but has since been updated to say the 8th
---
Ok not sure what to make of that. What about all these people I've heard doing Radiation Rumble claiming to use flamers to heal and keep the NPC's alive. Are you saying they are running around bashing the NPC's with a flamer?
---
Really early on they nerfed it so that there weren't as many legendary ghouls spawning, and I think they upped the time between when NPCs would respawn, meaning that for both gear and XP, there wasn't a huge advantage to nuking there anymore.
---
Question. How did you log out and connect back to the very same server he was in? Seems very unlikely unless you had him as a friend
---
Damn I'm on Xbox ..  hope somebody helps you out with new serums ..
---
I like the seedy shed, I can't use it though because the foundation is so ugly.
---
How's it an improvement? It doesn't even tell you what fucking ammo you have available to trade now. 
---
It's like 'oops you don't actually have enough of that'. Seriously they shoulda not touched it. Or better yet, never even made it.
---
Good info. Thank you
---
So the second shot isn't free in terms of durability loss?
---
You're the smartest of us all.
---
I kept trying only to realise it's a sinking ship. The redux is woeful.
---
As a great pilot once said, "This is where the fun begins"
---
Why do you engage though? I mean this earnestly as I'm curious.
---
There are so many better, lesser known games out there that could do with some play and attention but this is the one you've stuck with. Why?
---
What does ahead mean? And missing 10 days of dailies is a very significant loss of SCORE. Unless you spent a LOT of time to compensate for those missed points, your "30 mins a day" argument still reinforces the idea that you are expected to treat the game like a second job, where you have to get on EVERY day.
---
True but the queen was never made to be taken down alone.
---
Yeah it's strange, i know that blocker works in PA but serendipity doesn't
---
When did they allude to that? Sounds like I missed some news.
---
YES WE NEED THIS!
---
They probably planned the stream weeks in advance. Delaying it was a last minute decision so they couldn't really change what they had planned.
---
craft and scrap pipe guns with scrapper/super duper
---
A w k w a r d 😬
---
Could be your rig
---
It's still a guaranteed 3* legendary, pretty much as good as it gets in this game. What do you want, a bloodied explosive gatling plasma or bloodied fire rate fixer every time you beat the event?
---
Possibly, I have a Ryzen 1700x, 8gb ram, and a 1060 3gb.
---
I think you should supply me with your credit card details...
---
Come on dude.
---
I go for the elite spawn in Hopewell Cave and then jump on top of the bus, that way when a level 91 legendary glowing deathclaw can't path to me I can shout "that's right, you better run!"
---
I bought a SS deep pocket plan which appeared generic for the SS.  Turns out it's just for chest where I use the jet pack.  What did I miss in the description of the plan?
---
so for people like you, they can never make you happy. So just leave then.
---
My favorite place. And the jukebox
---
Doesn't change the fact it was once craftable for a brief moment. There are old posts on reddit of people who could craft them before the event went live.
---
Bro I’ve been searching for a bloodied lever gun forever... cherish it lol
---
They say they want feedback on the season. Hopefully they have an easy way to submit ideas like this. I agree there was a lot of filler. My bigger concern is all of the ghillie and onslaught variances. Waste of space.
---
I was with you in the first half of this comment! Very much against a premium track for seasons however. Already the game heavily encourages you to spend money. There are many outfits, some ripped straight from fallout 4, which can only be acquired through the atom store. If you care at all about building up your camp, guess where the majority of the content is.
---
The season has been an absolute shitshow, and getting the player to pay for it too would just hide all the rewards you might actually want behind a paywall. You'd get a lunchbox tier, and a power armour shamelessly stolen from the Fallout 4 creation club, tier. No challenge atoms, just score earning you less and less as you progress along a board devoid of functional, decent looking rewards.
---
Blocker works in pa? I thought it was only nerd rage, dodgy and ricochet, you sure? That means I gotta change my build up a little
---
Yes, I was wondering the same.  Is it that they don't want the extra AP.
---
Only if it murders you and dumps you in the garbage bin.
---
I didn't know that!
---
ALSO THEY ALREADY HAVE AN ASSET! Giiiiiveee bethedsa
---
They released bundles on steam when they added Wastelanders, that is the price tag for that content. But let's be real here, they had to add Wastelanders for the longevity of the game. You don't update your game, players will stop playing it.
---
Oh also - would be super cool if we could have slot machines at our camp and be the house for other players to gamble or something too.
---
The most tedious part to me is switching your perks all the time.  Any time I craft or go out looting or on an event, I have to spend a minute changing all my cards around.  And I have to craft pretty frequently to maintain gear and ammo.  I also think there’s too much gear maintenance in this game.  Ammo and weapons break so fast, they are in constant need of repair.
---
This would be a funny April fools event
---
Are you still following me? That's... kinda sad, actually.
---
Have a look at https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks
---
How have I never seen this before?!? That was a thing of beauty. Thank you for making my day! :)
---
I just save all my credits from the previous season, and it usually pays for my next season.  The season pass is free if you are frugile with your rewards.  Fortnite was the same way.
---
Saint Peter don't you call me 'cause i can't go
---
Well at least I know I’ll recognize you in case an apocalypse happened and we both survived.
---
You should have. We have cookies. And X01 power armor.
---
.... thats the problem...
---
poor form...
---
Right? Give me 250 steel and I'll give you 2 stimpacs any day.
---
As someone else told me when I went bloodied, it’s not really hard. You need at least 3pts in INT and the Nerd Rage Perk card. Other useful cards (typically 3 points each) are things like Blocker (STR), Dodgy (AGI), Evasive (AGI), etc. these change the game hit dynamics. You can also slot in DR boosting perks if you want or need to or just wear Power Armor (“PA”) as a simple work around.
---
To really start stacking like I did you do have to have mutations and a full set of Unyielding armor. 
---
For mutations, you need to permanently lock five points of LCK for Starched Genes (2pt) and Class Freak (3pts). These will lock out new mutations and prevent existing mutations from ever expiring plus negate all the bad effects of those mutations.
---
The rest is all up to you, playstyle (if you can still call it that at this point), and how far you are in the game. I’m level ~250 with &gt;700 hours logged so I already spent about 4-5k gold bullion on Secret Service armor/under armor plans and mod plans for them. Now, I’m spending all my script on Legendary Modules and trying to get 3-star Unyielding Secret Service for every slot. I roll 5 pieces of armor a day and usually get zero 3star Unyielding for the 2 slots I’m still trying to replace other non-SS Unyielding pieces from. When I do get one, I feel I hit the jackpot. Even after I get 3star SS Unyielding in all slots I’ll probably still spend my script on Legendary Modules to try and roll for “better” Major and Minor Legendary abilities on different 3star Unyielding pieces. That process will take months and tie up my Script for the duration. It also means I end up with a ton of armor I don’t want and cannot sell. I either destroy it or go around encumbered until my time locks are up and I can efficiently sell off the 1-3 star random SS armor pieces I won’t use.
---
Weapon wipe:  need rage and the stats already boost your weapon damage so you don’t technically need a bloodied weapon but that just boosts it further. I would focus on survivability first because you’re going to be running around the wasteland with 30-40hp. After that, you can worry about finding the perfect weapon.
---
Hope this helps!
---
Clearly Rock Paper Shotgun is very wrong
---
I've been finishing my dallies then switching straight to ghost of Tsushima.   I hope I finish the legendary run before the new season of rocket league starts.
---
I certainly think it needs testing. This indicates it combines with Demo Expert so I can't see why it wouldn't work with your Legendary Explosive weapon. https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks/grenadier.
---
You mean I shouldnt be running on top of my horse?
---
And then you still have whatever left over to donate the smaller amount.
---
If only they'd let us either break down ammo for the base components or just give us a list of fractional exchange rates for each type and let us click a type to select how many we want to convert, like in trade/stash menus.
---
I want the robot dog from NV!
---
Ahead  means I'm in front of that zorbo dude (3 step ahead exactly).
---
Sure 10 days is a lot of loss, but that tell the opposite of what you say: you can just play cool, without not feeling being forced to play and still be on track. 
---
Think about that: The OP finished the race 30 days before the limit... 30 days...  
---
unless he spent a lot of atoms, this is a huge amount of play time to just get all scores with the repeatable xp challenge...   
---
I guess you overthink the  "30mn a day" thing. When I say that, it's only in regard of the huge amount of time the OP probably spent just to not spend this time on a regular basis... it's a bit absurd. And sure, I understand if he find that awful, but this was his choice.  
---
(On a side note, if your job is to work 30mn a day, at the time you want, you are lucky  ;))
---
I'm right there with you friend.
---
Are you serious??? INT increases XP? 
---
Where is this explained in-game? How are people supposed to know or even learn these things?
---
That explains all the “Building” teams lately. I couldn’t figure out how the INT bonus could possibly be useful.
---
Dying.
---
If that's the lame ass path you wanna choose go ahead. This game is full to the brim of cheaters anyhow, if you know the right people you don't even need to play NW AT ALL to get the rewards. I'm pitching an idea for a game mode a lot of people can only enjoy for 3 days at a time maybe, before the cheat menus get updated. It's kind of stupid for you to even mention this, as if enduring the shitstorm of cheaters is somehow more morally sound than people making private NW games to level up themselves.
---
I wasn't talking about expeditions, I know they said they're going to be something else. 
---
I went to check and noticed that in the English roadmap they have the same name, "Daily Ops" and "New Daily Ops", but for some reason the "New Daily Ops" are translated as "Dungeons" in the Italian version of the roadmap, and since the devs said in the AMA a few months ago that the Vaults would come back in a new dungeon system I thought that was it.
---
In any case, IMO if the Vaults were ready for release in a month they'd have said something about them at Quakecon yesterday, when literally every other game but 76 had something new revealed, so until they announce otherwise I'm still of the opinion that Vaults aren't coming until winter.
---
Yes and this is worse... now you can select ammo you don’t have and then it says you don’t have enough!
---
All it needed was to list what you have and a slider to allow you to select how much to sell. Dame for buying!
---
I don’t know what the dev was thinking when they designed this but is a load of s**t!
---
I allways give away lots of stimpaks and radaways bevor I log off.
---
I really don't need them and I don't need the caps I get from them. So I give them to low lvl player.
---
How can you even put on pacifist in NW? I'm literally talking about a NW match you have to get invited to. Not adventure mode. The public NW servers should be dead until they figure out a way to implement something to block third party hacks. I had a really good time playing NW when I came back this week, only for it to be ruined by chodes who can't learn how to play a really simple game. The fact people need to cheat in 76 is indicative of their laziness and extreme lack of intelligence.
---
I want a Roboscorpion, but a Cyberdog will do.
---
It looks like a missing texture placeholder, It looks like there is a absent of haze which is what it might be.
---
Try ark survival or subnautica. Two very different survival games.
---
lmao that's been happening for years too 🤣
---
Wow. If you reduce some str and endurance points and increase the other special to 9, you can try every useful perk cards in Nuclear Winter.
---
That's just my first impression to your post. Hehe
---
'Great, at least it's nice out!' makes me crack up even more after the patch. I, too, miss my daily Where's Ward-o? mini game, and I think the devs should have added a chain-and-ball to his feet when they finally grounded him, just for the comedy.
---
so this wasn't a valiant attempt to fix a system no one was use hmmm some people don't appreciate the things they get
---
I thought nobody would top the Anthem dev livestream in term of fails but it seem Bethesda succeeded.
---
Honestly its the community that makes fallout 76 fun. 76 would be unplayable as a single player. Ive seen some of the coolest camps and met some awsome people. I had a level 45 guide me though my first few missions and hook my up with a decked out hunting rifle(those mods though). I used that until almost level 25. Keep fallout being the best choice for post apocalyptic simulation!
---
Oh damn yeah that would be sick, or like a roboscorpion security system would be incredible
---
Ah right, makes sense. Never seen that before
---
2 handed melee
---
Why did people move points out of agility for adrenaline being broken, there are so many good agility perks!
---
I paid 9 dollars on amazon😂
---
So the method i suggested was what was asked for moons ago.... beth just did the usual and claimed it was what was asked for.
---
In reality “we” asked for the bugs to be fixed and they delivered this so there’s that...
---
Yeah, people will invite only guys which are up to play nw as pacifist.
---
They gather up at a certain discord or wherever and make the rule that no one gets shoot, only survival for rewards. No pacifist mode needed when everyone who is participating is comfortable with bushing
---
Thx so much, I’ll check! Would be nice if Game organized collections and such but oh well 😏 thx again!
---
I don't use pa, the turrets arnt that bad if yiu have decent armour.
---
The server stability of ESO has tanked since the latest expansion!
---
I should probably add that the corner Bethesda painted themselves in here is spelled out in my post too. The primary fun I’m having I’m game right now is when I make myself a perfect Unyielding SS armor piece. To do that I have to farm time-locked script like anyone else. 
---
Because of encumbrance limits, however, I’m dumping a ton of other amor pieces with different effects on them.
---
If Bethesda nerfs the bloodied build then all of the work I did to get those Unyielding pieces is for nothing AND I likely will have trashed the piece that I end up needing instead. It’s this second point that is going to really piss off bloodied builds when this eventually happens. All games have expansions that outdate old-era gear. However, it’s unlikely that FO76 would do that. What they’ll probably do is nerf the existing bloodied gear (or perks), rendering the current gear worthless. That will bite hard because we will lose literally hundreds of hours of progress while simultaneously taking a big step backwards. That’s why balancing this is difficult.
---
Honestly, the best thing Bethesda could do if they were actually actively developing rather than just skinning the game would be to plan to outdated the bloodied build with the next *era* of gear. Games like Everquest 1 learned this lesson after vehement outcry at various nerds over their history. The lesson, essentially, is that change is easier to manage on a go-forward basis.
---
I would agree with the extra rewards (especially another double xp weekend) however Bethesda has released a statement about the camp building and they are working on implementing a double sided wall feature.
---
this is why you people will never find or have reclaimed ultracite or reinforced bos you don't wanna fight to get it maybe some things aren't as buggy as you think
---
Blocker definitely works. Here's a list:

I'll sell you some real cheap on Xbox.
---
My main is PA heavy full hp build running vampires &amp; furious gatling weapons. I have fun and can't wait for the collosal problem event. Being a tank is fun and I've learned early on is that it's not always about dealing max damage. It's also less maintenance as far as a build goes. You'll still have fun.
---
Some where out in the world, a tear was shed.
---
_Replace?_   **WHY??**   
---
#*ADD*
---
It IS a lot of content and quests while leveling up. The issue is that the end game consists entirely of doing the same events over and over. There needs to be something more creative added for people who have already completed all of the other quests.
---
thanks for lmk
---
There's a big picture of it on the map.
---
I have an Jffr 25 gauss minigun,  a Aaffr 25 gauss minigun,  ts ffr rw gauss minigun and a Junkies ffr 25 gauss minigun. I'm bloodied 😑
---
I try to do that too, I don't mind the season idea especially over the loot crate crap
---
I just did this last night as a level 29 with a level 64. Thank God she was with me because some gigantic level 80 creature came out of nowhere. We ended up still beating it though. Went through all 10 of my stimpacks n some cola.
---
Love for the setting, and love for the truly wonderful world building of Appalachia.   It's a real pleasure to wander around the map, and it's a damn shame the game didn't get the development it deserved.  I think a big part of it is that it WAS fun for the first 100 levels or so, but the game shipped with only so much content, and once that was gone, that was basically that.  
---
Like almost all of the post release design has been a horrible shit show, with nothing to encourage me that it will get markedly better, but there is a gem under all those turds.  If the development had a director with an actual desire to make the game worth playing it could be a great game, but clearly that's not the case.
---
Lmao. Not even close.
---
Just had the same here
---
Poultry rewards sound delicious. Shame I'm a herbivore
---
Going to be even slower for me... Can't finish the Ounce of Prevention quest, so locked out of even getting to the point of being able to farm Bullion daily. Knowing Bethesda it'll take at least 3 weeks to fix, that's a lot of missed Bullion.
---
How is this any worse than people wiping entire lobbies in NW to level up?
---
Another awareness post that bethesda believes that all crime needs to be punished by death.
---
Better than the Jaws Cello stalking you :-)
---
Ah yes the day of running into that and getting totally stumped. Also the days of having no idea the combos to breed to get the golden Chocobo. Fun times.
---
Restart the game after nuclear winter. Don't go out of bonds... or do...
---
Yeah, missed opportunity in my book. Chicken coop should produce chicken, eggs, and maybe fertilizer. I mean who needs fertilizer? I have so much food spoils I don’t need it. Of course, I will put it in my camp simply because there is animation.
---
I was hesitant to suggest a premium track for reasons you described as a lot of their structure is a mess.  In a perfect world where they get everything in a good place it could work but I could also grow wings and fly before that
---
Just come off after a 6 hour session, no issues.. PS4 Europe
---
I mean fallout 5 isn't out for like a good 10 years probs. Got starfield and the next elder scrolls to come out before it yet.
---
Seek the Firebreathers in Charleston?
---
What really made it was me putting on the deepest voice I could muster to say 'thanks bruv' and just logging out before he had a chance to respond
---
I did it in fallout 4, I had a different camp design in every settlement, with glitches and no mods. Sanctuary was a factory ,hang mans ally was raider , the Covenant or what was that quiz camp called, a brothel, apartment building in one, dollhouse another, dungeon in diamond city, boathouse was fighting pit, etc. I got the ideea to build different camps from a youtube video with one guy that was doing the same. He had the Lighthouse as a Power armour Showroom.
---
Its their netcode, Bethesda don't have dedicated servers for fallout. Nothing you can do.
---
New updates are my favourite gamble
---
You are wrong, read the patch notes.  [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/2Z8aZWK1CISDkxWAcwQhw8/fallout-76-patchnotes-update-21-4-august-2020](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/2Z8aZWK1CISDkxWAcwQhw8/fallout-76-patchnotes-update-21-4-august-2020) 
---
However, the fact that they didnt make sure the quest worked after patching it is beyond awful and totally mind blowing.
---
Didn’t know the chicken coop dropped from the queen!
---
I was going to say the same. I wish there was some way to tell how much lag there is between user and server. A small real-time bar graph or color changing dot would be awesome. Either in the menu or a corner somewhere.
---
Strangler Heart PA has better rad resistance than ultracite and also gives acid damage to armed attacks while making enemies around you take acid damage over time.
---
No problems here, basically. I sometimes get 1 crash   a day, but that's pretty much it.
---
I actually commented yesterday that I didn’t have a crash since the new patch.. of course 30 minutes later it did crash.. but I has seemed more stable
---
Destiny 2 does it every 5 levels after 100 you get an Engram to use at Eververse 
---
Although I'm not a fan of the premium track tbh as I feel that would end up becoming too much, keep it free and the way it is, it's more than enough to be honest
---
They still need to abide by the contract of those who purchased a year up front!
---
Nope. that extra hit/bullet/projectile also drains the bar 1 full increment, making it break faster. and the flamer itself breaks really fast as is. better to go for something else. like a Vampire's, Junkies, Bloodied, Etc.
---
I thought they had this chick stream because she was competent...
---
Like I explained, the real servers will be infested with hackers and some poor pigs trying to get into the game mode along some Tryhards. Did you ever played nuclear winter? The lobby's are dead yet, you have to wait ages and get an 25 players lobby. Splitting the player base even more would end up everyone playing on their private servers alone or gathering up for booster lobby's without the intention to really play the game.
---
30 fps is the goal that the game and maintains minus instances with a lot of activity going on like the Queen fight with all the mobs, explosions and gunfire. PS5/Series could jump that up to 60 fps assuming they don't give a massive graphical overhaul to the game that might reduce that. But the frames for console are about what they can be.
---
Unless you got proof otherwise.
---
He used some odd neckbeardy word to describe her too...if only I could remember it was pretty cringe.
---
I think anything that grows should be plantable in our gardens.   It would really be interesting and fun.
---
I struggle to get 10 mils and my friend needs them
---
I see, darn I hope it'll settle down soon, I couldn't even play a single match of nw
---
Being able to craft it *before the event want live* has no bearing upon the fact that it was not meant to ever be crafted during or after the legitimate event period.
---
People keep saying West Tek, Whitespring Golf Club and National Isolated Radio Array but I've never had much luck there. I usually check the fissure sites.
---
So it’s a good thing then. Cool.
---
I haven’t done a queen run since the new patch as I haven’t been playing much, but has flux drop now been altered on some way? I’ve seen some wishy washy stuff about queen drops but beyond that 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
On one hand, I'm like "Have you no honor, sir?!" But on the other, I'm like "Nice."

Yep exactly and that’s the problem with the perk system.. lost count of the times is gone into battle with Ammosmith, super duper and hard bargain

Shishkebab is best for that perk! Flamers need or be gun bashed which costs far too much ap to be worth it!
---
The dollhouse build was a CAMP challenge last year and you'll find dozens of them. It's not "stealing" it's just a flipping camp. They used an idea for inspiration.
---
Finally somebody wins! Good for you!!

I’m definitely going to look into this.

Too many animation flaws and matt bugs to list.

Clipping into walls floors and camp items when spawn travelling.

Respawn doesn’t work if you die at the point the SBQ or encrypted dies.

Non npc vats broken.

Fast travel works about 75% of the time, the other 25% of the time the map just closes.

Overweight travel bug. When you are overweight and go back underweight the ui shows no overweight icon but FT still reports you are overweight.

He said he had a teammate. You can rejoin a team from the main menu, even if it's a public team.

when I had a 1060 3g some games identified it as a 6gb which caused some issues. Also, make sure you're not playing in windowed mode.
---
Sign, trade only.
---
I can support the internet argument. Gigabit AT&amp;T fiber here bypassing their crappy router gateway. Average 1-2ms latency to most services with minimal jitter. I still get waves of the issues you describe. Especially perks or armor effects not working. Or just randomly dying while running through the Forrest region. For me rubber banding happens during big group fights mostly and I can notice lag spikes.
---
It's like idiot savant on high Inteligence it is so rare and loud that it just becomes a jumpscare.
---
There was no false advertisement, they had no set date for those features. You’re the dumbass who paid for something without a committed time frame and are now mad at them
---
They stopped recording our steel donations at (169.87%) but this was about 6pm GMT yesterday so who knows if players wasted even more after that!
---
Ok I’ll make sure to add you now
---
I get it. I really do.  
---
But tbh if the extent of the details you're providing are limited to "this shit" then this post won't accomplish anything and is just a half-measure. Either you quietly get your money back and put this situation behind you, or you detail your grievances and their wrongdoing to bring it to light and spread awareness.  
---
Anything in between is just wasting your time and energy even more than what has already been claimed from you.
---
It’s triggered by notifications in the upper left hand corner
---
Modules are for crafting Secret Service armor, and guass weapons. Vault steel and modules are needed for crafting Solar armor, and T65 power armor.
---
DM me you’re IGN and I’ll see if I can’t help you later
---
Haven't had any issues with crashing but the lag is just insane. And you also have 5 minutes to get back to your private world before it resets. Should be plenty of time to be honest.
---
As long as you’ve got good report with your bank, and haven’t asked for something like this in the last year you should be good to go.
---
yes very common bugs they were in fallout four they weren't going to get batter they can try they're best but they can't just rework the whole camp system that's how we got the bug where your fast travel point no longer appears
---
I play NW frequently. I think underestimate the amount of people who just want a nice solid game of NW. Boosting is a thing in literally every online game, you cannot escape it, it is a reality. The game wouldn't be dead because NW communities would thrive on private games. This is idea is better than sitting here screaming into the void at Bethesda who simply won't take action against 3rd party users in meaningful way. I'd love to see you respond to that particularly.
---
It might "eventually" work &amp; Bethesda might bring back the "set the world on fire" challenge at some point, so if you have the stash space I'd hold into the TS
---
the fireproof perk would assist. also Dense armor torso if you do not want to use up perk slots for fireproof
---
Riding Shotgun is an event you can trigger manually and repeat with server hops, and always have one guaranted 3 star legendary enemy (it can spawn more legendary enemies but that one always spawn).
---
If that were true then why do I see people die who are bloodied?
---
There is no waste in my time by telling people they can get their money back while shorting bethesda at the same time. 
---
Simply letting people know is enough.
---
And if you have to ask why fallout 1st isn’t worthwhile then you are fortunate in your ignorance.
---
Laminate floors
---
Canvas bags
---
Fallout 1st features.
---
Just google these for fo76 and you’ll understand.
---
I feel sad because I scripped my 3* Shishkebab not long ago as it seemed to be outperformed in melee damage by other things I had.
---
Jump ;)
---
Also keep a non explosive backup weapon for those times you can't avoid closer quarters
---
Um.... what false features?
---
There is a major difference: the vendors with inventory overlay have a daily reset, the ammo converter has not such a limitation. Tho it would be very pleasurable to had it, I bet my liver that Bethesda screw it up and open a exploit they probably "fix" with disable the ammo converter for several weeks, just to get us back to the current overlay.
---
That's how Bethesda work, that's how they handle the game. Don't illusionary think it will be different now.
---
Why I quit Fallout 76. Not playing anymore of this dumpster fire of bugs and errors until they relaunch this POS.
---
If you can get a vampires reduced weight one is best, as you then heal yourself and arn't weighed down by it!
---
better than spending 3.5k caps on an recipe that cost 10 caps from another player
---
Ok I'll just use a Vampires gun. Screw healing everyone else when I can just heal myself lol.
---
I don't use ammo, I like to tear that bat apart with a chainsaw
---
I love fallout
---
Blood Eagle jacket looks good on her.
---
I have 140 Legendary Modules right now. They are all I purchase from that vendor now since she always gives me shit items. One day, I will mass craft a bunch of gauss and/or Secret Service pieces and be let down even more.
---
To a point maybe but chances are the people who played Fo76 the longest are the people who would normally support the Fallout universe for the last decade. But if they dont mind that same fan base being alienated on the small chance they at no time since last christmas have they came accross extremely duped/common plans than Im fine with leaving.
---
Yeah it seems like it could be a useful weapon if fixed but nobody will really want it from my shop so might as well keep it on a mule.
---
Nukesdragons is a good one for perk loadouts.
---
Yep me too .. but it is my 5th character so not too much of a biggie , I just gave her max mutations and I’m farming for legendaries and XP until the fix it..  
---
It’s a hell of a lot of fun, killed 5 SB’s so far and cleared whitespring. I killed 3 level 68 supermutants earlier today and still only level 22 .
---
(The secret is to take your time and choose good positions, go for torso shots until you get a crit then switch to head) if possible kite enemy’s towards each other they’ll do a lot of the work for you
---
Also done a lot of high level events .. I’m the low level with no Armour and a pipe pistol tagging everything I can!
---
U on pc homie? I can give u one
---
Damn munchies!
---
Farm radstags.
---
I work at night currently with this heat wave at home so i practically have no time to play as i try to invest most of my time in sleeping. If i do get on its after work and i usually fall asleep when i turn my console on.
---
Wha- ho-  How could you not realize a texture you put in the final game was just the word Chains?
---
Exactly, I have seen numerous 'doll house' camps. For all we know, the person who made a YouTube video stole the idea from someone else? There's only so many camp build types you can make with the limited resources in this game, people are bound to have similar ideas. 
---
If it was an *exact* copy, fair enough but if it's just another house as you said I see no problem.
---
LOL, thats my go to move, but Ive spent a lot of time and scrip trying to get the "Perfect" armor and gun, to not be able to use it at close quarters. Its more of a gauss rifle than a shotgun now.
---
What platform are you on? I am on PC and it gives 5 rads just for collecting water.
---
For some reason it was more stable for me before the patch
---
Kudos to you for taking all 3 pylons. I simply refuse to do so. I take 1 pylon and that's it. Let others take the other 2. They don't? Touch luck then.
---
Ok I'll keep that in mind. Not currently weighed down over my max though so this Vampires I'm using will do for now.
---
Not being happy with a product doesn’t mean you weren’t aware or weren’t getting what you paid for. You are encouraging people to commit fraud and misrepresent their claim plain and simple.
---
Is it a problem with a driver? Or just the game?
---
Not until they do their job and rightfully so. Sorry dear Bethesda mole. Lol
---
That's true. But they could just give 9,999,999 of currency and each ammo to the vendor and reset daily... Even with limits, as long as they are very high, this would be a non issue... This abortion of an interface is anything but convenient.
---
I'm sure they did it like they did because they fear more exploits.
---
Can't shake these dreams...floating in space forever. Just...why?
---
Oh I did.
---
And I’m getting my money back for every month they failed to provide the service they advertised too.
---
I run dense torso mod and level 1 fire proof .. that and trying not to shoot at point blank has cured my suicidal tendencies
---
Ive got both...do they not stack?
---
I have been playing since November 2018. I do not feel alienated. We keep getting new stuff. I got my money’s worth hundreds of hours ago.
---
You can swing a shishkebab faster than you can bash a flamethrower, costs less ap too.
---
Not every swing will heal, there is a cooldown I think but every second swing will do it!
---
It works great in every escort event.
---
Yes, I have a few go to spots
---
2000 hours? My God looks like you got your money's worth. Play something else. If I get 50 hours out of a game I consider it solid.
---
This is wonderful shitpost creator and I support every idea
---
Thanks for saving me the atoms for the rainwater collector I was hoping it would be better.  
---
I am talking about the pristine nuka cola vending machine that is in the atom shop right now. I am aware you can put nuka cola in it that you cannot do with the punch bowl.   
---
Wondering if you can put purified water in it?
---
They're getting paid well to look stupid, I'll give them that. They go home at the end of the day knowing whether or not FO76 is a shitstorm, their wallets are still lined. They have no incentive to fix the games bugs, exploits, or have a meaningful anti-cheat. Remember their so-called "New Anti-Cheat" in Wastelanders? That definitely worked out well. This game can be so great sometimes, but never for too long. It's something I've tried to stick with and I'll continue to do so. I just wish I didn't feel compelled to set the game down after a month or two of playing.
---
I can assure you, you aren't a trendsetter and no one has copied you. All these ideas you've listed are extremely common and are in no way shape or form unique enough to be considered original.
---
I'm working on my 2nd character, as the first one was not doing much in terms of damage etc. Decided I might as well start a new character and do it right, unfortunately this bug happened, so can't farm that.
---
Currently just exploring the map for locations and getting legendary items to scrip for that upcoming discount. Only enemy that really gets me are the ones with poison, not sure how to properly counter it.
---
You can get away with it somewhat using fireproof and a dense torso mod.  Running demo expert will still kill you at close enough range, though.  Its part of the price you pay for all that damage :D
---
I'd like to see less power armour skins
---
You are encouraging companies to advertise without delivery.
---
Which do you think is more important to maintain?  
---
Bethesda’s “integrity”
---
Or my money?
---
its like, i played one or two days a week (a good 2-3 hr session each) &amp; had my fill for the week.  now having to schedule an extra 1-2 hrs a day just to grab useless imaginary points that *are only available on those days* is a real PITA.
---
robust list of weeklies (ala possum scouts even tho some were just viciously difficult) and/or rolling over count (kill x # of creature y, over and over again).  &amp; also the erstwhile 'prizes' roll over and over too (gee, more perk card packs; at least the gum is valuable!)
---
even tho the rewards are terrible, i really like the idea of community gathering materials for different factions.  i keep thinking/saying maybe about this game and its already pretty far along tho lol
---
4 day old troll account ..
---
That’s why, console players are better! 😜
---
People love to complain about video game development. "I'm the customer so I'm always right."
---
That PA weight penalty is pretty much why I’m in excavator PA whenever I’m not in reg armor.
---
Seriously...? I'm sighing right now because my 3* Shishkebab I scripped not long ago had 40% faster swing speed.
---
Seems obvious right? Thanks for the input
---
And I wish this past would go away. The fix would be making the mask not work with hats AGAIN. I like that they actually reverted it so we can wear this mask with hats
---
^^Definitely this. I’m always jumping like like a mad person when I use my Gauss shotty. Especially during queen fights..but when that scorched tick is right up on me as I hit the trigger button...I watch my death in slow mo....at least I’m taking it down with me! Lol. I have max Fireproof which helps a little (more so with other explosive weapons, not so much with the gauss I found out 🤪)
---
It took me a long time to figure out what it was too. I kept thinking it was some weird event notification.
---
FT to non camps and normal locations is the same....
---
I'm not sure if faster swing speed works out for better npc healing because of the cooldown on the perk.
---
But then I've never had a swing speed shishkebab to test with.
---
just check if the has on a lot of GPU intensive settings, if so you may need to dial them back.
---
The choice is then death by suicide or murdered ( those level 1 ghouls are beasts).
---
There have a been a few server crashing exploits with stacking camp items, walls being one. I'm sure someone reported yet another bug of that caliber concerning walls.
---
lol, ikr!
---
like, why do i need charisma in a game w/ no npcs?  join a team, wtf no sharing a perk card, souless?
---
(fyi, u need charisma 3 to share a level 1 card w/ squadmates)
---
Unless it's been significantly changed from the WC in-game now, it's not that it's particularly hard, just a bullet sponge.
---
Oh ok. Well, it's gone and I'll never get to test it so no point thinking about it.
---
No, they screwed things up by breaking two major questlines...lying about adding SS Mods in the patch notes, causing insane lag around ash piles in major events, breaking weapon wall displays, etc.
---
I do enjoy the game, but Patch 21 is an abomination that never should have been released in its current state.
---
 Chain chain chaiiiiiiin. Chain of foooools
---
We complain because we *do* like it, and want it to be improved.
---
"I'm completely satisfied" is great, but the game does have significant problems, which should be raised until they're fixed. That's the only reason Bethesda even acknowledged the new CAMP problems in the first place - and they haven't fixed them *yet*.
---
shhhhhhhhh you haven't actually been here since the beta or you'd know that there are bugs and game destroying glitches that made it literally unplayable that have been patch
---
It's much tankier and bigger than the current roaming ones! Does more damage too, not to mention an arena that damages us and limited to only 8 people, rarther than the SBQ being piled on by a whole server!
---
So you're going to steal from Bethesda for them delivering the exact service they advertised and for you mistaking future plans for actual features? You're committing a fraud, just because you cannot read...
---
NGL that's pretty damn awesome and I might be a little jealous.
---
Raider punk is probably my fav as he talks the least for me. And I can live with "Oh.... hey"
---
I started a new character 2 weeks ago and the only thing anyone's given me is PvP at the rusty pick.
---
Player engagement does not = player happiness and that is what big companies like Bethesda fail to see.
---
Score challenges should also reward a small number of atoms in addition to rewards, but that does NOT make Bethesda money, which fallout 76 is designed to extract as much as possible to appease shareholders.
---
Even with a Dense chest mod and Fireproof you can still cripple yourself if you are still within the blast radius.
---
Make sure you have plenty stims to heal your broken bones
---
Or god forbid you're wearing Power Armor when you load in. It inverts the camera controls and doesn't load you in correctly for a good 30 seconds. Eventually it does, but like, is that AAA material?
---
Name one feature they said was included in your subscription that they did not provide
---
You already got my response in the previous two answers. It just won't work. How did you think it would be, having a party limitation of 4 people? Inviting up to 30 ppl when the social menu bugs and disable itself frequently? How will they prevent power leveling, which is now no thing at all except you have a great team which is intended anyway? I know no way to exploit in nw to reach rank 100 fast without dominating most of the games.
---
Bethesda is acting against cheaters, just.. not efficient enough. Erectus got disabled several times, they tried to implement anticheat, saw it doesn't work and removed it again. Now with erectus reborn Bethesda need to adress how it works first to block it.
---
I also play nw frequently, I'm from Europe. Mid days its a hassle to find lobby's, midnight to early morning I only get us servers. Waiting time between matches are about 4-5mins, always enough time for a smoke. There are never more then 2-3 lobby's and everytime I see common names.
---
Cowtipping like in Fallout NV 😀
---
It’s the guitar bear from Skyrim mods following you.
---
Again, name one feature that they said was included in your subscription that they did not provide.
---
You got the exact service they advertises. You knew what you were buying so you have no right for your money back.
---
Everyone complains because we want to see the game become what it’s supposed to be. This game has a lot of potential. We don’t want to see it go down. So we let Bethesda know what’s wrong and what they could do but they don’t listen.
---
"Is"??? Most everyone has been, pretty much since WL dropped, dw, you're not the only one. xD
---
Well that might be the case overall I talking about event paticipation obviously and I along with a ton of others veterans wont be logging in and participating yet again.
---
Please do not give them ideas about paying for season tracks. So much of this game is locked behind a paywall that I am unable to access as it is.
---
anyone who legitimately thinks the customer is always right has never worled in the retail, food service, or customer service industries. customers can be wrong. and often are. a lot.
---
Too bad that’s not for you to decide, huh?
---
They were all bloodied builds, that’s why they are at half health. It’s also a good example of another problem with the game.
---
So maybe that "Adsomthing Skeleton" perk would help...
---
Rad fluids tho...
---
What so fixing a lightbulb was important?
---
Or the latest gaff to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt there is no testing. The hit box on the new blue loot “bag” is the same size as the paper bag...
---
I’ll give u they fixed the day 2 of testing nuke bug but that one again proved they didn’t even test that with more than a couple of players...
---
I mean the end game task crashes the server EVERY time! Come on...
---
SA armour was buggy and made you immortal (not god mode).
---
God mode had been about since the beta and still is not 100% fixed!
---
Yeah, he bought before he thought and now he tries to steal from Bethesda to make himself feel better...
---
Buy from Regs in vault 76
---
I see a pooch post, I upvote!
---
But half health is not a good place to be as a bloodied build, that was my point.
---
You say "they." There is a team of developers, and they don't all have the same jobs, but they all have deadlines. 
---
I'm just saying, these are people, and they're trying to do their jobs, but no one is ever satisfied. I understand the patch wasn't perfect and brought new issues, but no one bothered to address anything that was actually fixed. That's all.
---
Maybe they're doing it wrong??
---
You can get them when you finish the wastelanders quests
---
I just PA glitch through the walls now, you can't hide the 5 story high indusrial complex behind some shitty wooden doors from me.
---
Eh I’m a lazy bastard. But good point
---
Either way it sounds like Bethesda still got their money haha
---
Per the patch notes, they were supposed to release deep pocketed limbs for the SS armor. But they didn't. The current available plan is only for the chest, which as you know can't be used with the jetpack
---
I wish they'd consider an overhaul of the taming system that would see you go out and find your pet, construct their preferred habitat at your CAMP, and then they can't be injured fatally similarly to the allies.
---
*shrug* and I get mine too.
---
Jokes on you, it takes 3 mini nukes for the cheapest option for some unknowable reason.
---
One of my level 200 characters can’t deal with poison! Us low levels have no chance
---
kind of a stretch to call this "content" in the traditional sense.  its stuff, sure.  knick-knacks &amp; brick-a-bracks perhaps.  thingamajigys and doo-dads indeed. kit, kaboodle, and tackle most veritably.  but content, content?
---
feels more like something they "threw up there while (something else)" is going on.  my guess being the BOS and the scorched wendigo or wtf it is (a gangly widget?)  what's more, there's already a sub out there what is that paying for?  more tesla's for todd?  enough, those cars are just gas-guzzling gizmos i say!  harrumph!
---
Am I missing something? My gauss shotgun still kills the hell out of me with 3* fireproof lol
---
I agree that the posts complaining about the same things are excessive and frequently overdramatic, but the ammo converter is probably worse now.
---
At least before, you knew which kind of ammo you had enough of to convert, and weren't going to accidentally buy useless ammo when you get lag on button press.
---
And sure, they release a lot of new stuff, but when a noticeable portion of the new stuff is broken or otherwise messed up with the frequency it is, it's kind of like.. wouldn't it be better to get less stuff in a given period of time, if nothing else gets messed up and everything new works properly?
---
which you yourself have said they are incapable of doing.
---
I know, bethesda has been trolling for so much longer, how will I ever compete?
---
Your right, the progress is static and always expand on a set amount.
---
Also someone donated more then 100mil steel the very first hours and posted it on a discord, tho the progress didn't went further.
---
It's literally only neutering one single variant of bloodied builds, namely OP stealth archer. So you can't effectively stack sneak bonus with all the other bonuses you have, whooptidoo. The rest is still OP. Numerous other non-bloodied builds are neutered from scratch. 
---
But I agree, they need to approach the problem on a broader scale. Maybe make unyielding +1 for each piece, and introduce more damage types that can't be negated by perks. Or maybe make some buffs depend on absolute health rather than percentage. Excluding certain damage buffs from stacking with bloodied might also help.
---
Although, the first measure should be buffing other builds and legendary effects, like +100% dmg resp. 25+% dmg reduction for Mutants and the like, maybe some perks that apply buffs the less radiation and the more health you have. Also something like the opposite of unyielding, like with vanguard and bolstering. I'd also like to see perks that buff certain legendary effects, e.g. tank buster to make AA weapons more effective by adding more penetration and raising their dmg.
---
Yeah, a small frustration that I spent 500 gold thinking the plan covered limbs.  I think I'd rather ultra-light if that's ever available.
---
I only do the easiest ones. Some of them I prefer skipping.
---
What did it fix genuinely curious? And I mean fix not improve or correct from the last abysmal patch/"features"
---
Ok cool, thought I missed out
---
Maybe, but I run 2 points in Fireproof and a Dense mod with my Bloodied build. I never die from splash damage, but I doubt get crippled. I have so many diluted stimpacks that I just use them to help my broken bones.
---
I’m a Scrum Master, I know exactly how software development teams work, because I used to manage several.
---
And I would never, in a million years, allow such a bug-filled code package to be released into live production. Something broke, big-time broke, in the release process. Several features and additions that worked fine in the PTS were not there or working in the live code.
---
Someone screwed up.
---
Sure, they fixed a few things that “they” broke in the last patch, and I still enjoy the game, but unless the release process is SIGNIFICANTLY improved, this game will not head in a positive direction.
---
No it isn't.
---
That’s not how this works I’m afraid. 
---
The transactions are processed as CAT (or continuous authority transactions). If the merchant hasn’t provided the service offered in their terms and conditions then you may be eligible for a return of funds, but I’d imagine Bethesda’s legal team would be a little better at covering themselves than Sharon from your local branch. I personally am satisfied with the services provided by FO1st. 
---
Your bank will definitely be able to block future transactions (though Sharon would definitely prefer if you’d just cancel the service through the merchant). 
---
Having funds returned requires an investigation. You may receive them as a precredit, but that’s from your banks coffers and should be left untouched in your account until the fraud team fully investigates, then they’ll likely withdraw the precredit due to the investigation returning that merchant has provided the service they offered. 
---
I know you’re butthurt and trying to make a point and farm karma etc, but all this will do is make bankers jobs harder and more frustrating if you encourage others to do this. So please just block the CAT and lose the existing membership fee’s as a lesson to better read t&amp;c’s before subscribing to a service.
---
I just stopped playing I pre-ordered the game gave them every chance and the wastelanders actually seemed like it was really fun but for me it was too little too late that being said I've completely stopped posting on this form for the most part because I want to let everybody have some fun why can't everybody just do this?
---
Scorchbeasts are my primary source of legendaries if they don't pop on events.
---
This would be my dream from the event so it will never happen.  I have a quad 2 star harpoon gun I use as my daily driver and it is awesome.  With the Fletcher mod it is a shotgun that uses all my existing heavy gun perks.
---
I only pull out the flamer,  gatling gun, or ultracite gatling at the big events now when I pull out the power armor.
---
what are the subs paying for then?  re-packaging existing game systems, and then finding a way to charge for that is not great.  and if that's what they're having to do to "keep the lights on" then maybe there needs to be a major restructuring in how they operate
---
And that’s fine. We will still complete the community event and you’ll still get your rewards.
---
Lol...that "tick problem" is why I stopped running gun fu
---
Fallout Karen's amiright?
---
I’m sorry you’re so far out of your element that you sound crazy.
---
So you cannot name one feature they said was included in your subscription that they did not provide?
---
I would like to see this. Rather than a daily reward system, set it to run for 48 hours and those challenges are worth more. Of course, the challenges would need to take more work so may or may not work out.
---
I noticed this a few days ago. You also can’t place weapon displays any,ore.
---
Don’t need luck when you work with your bank.
---
Then everyone will know....the first rule of good farming club is we don’t talk about good farming club.
---
Lol. I should probably stop running that as well...should make my life much easier...with a few less self inflicted deaths! 😂
---
I'm a full health stealth pistol build and I still kill myself often enough with the gauss pistol.
---
oh that‘s just fantastic. i‘m really not in the mood to re-decorate my camp anymore. thank god i at least still have my legacy walls with wallpapers applied to both sides. big oof here.
---
This is why I don't want to run a Bloodied build, feels like you get his by poison once and you die.
---
I am trying to go for a "sniper" build instead, using the Brotherhood recon rifle as it comes with a suppressor, and using the ghillie armor from the legendary run. Quite enjoying it so far, just hope they fix the bug soon, so that I can start the Bullion farm for better gear or the Planter tile. 
---
I like the tile so that I can build anywhere, even if not near dirt.
---
The scrap box wasn't a selling point for me, but a server that never shuts down, that I would buy in for, but now that I know it does the same I'm out, thanks for the heads up
---
Those are hardly rewards but go ahead and collect them I for one will not be as I have that jumpsuit already in at least 2 games including Fo76 and I will not use a stupid baret either.(Even if I did I would wear the çlean/colorful Fasnacht baret as long as the texture target is not broke still.)
---
And if they are posted here, they will become common sooo....
---
What mats are u looking for?
---
There were some quest lines I wasn't able to progress in that I've been able to now. Ally: Crash Landing one was the main one I was referring to.
---
How does strangler compare to t65 and x01?
---
Seems to be luck of the draw with server hopping, tried it 20 times and failed 20 times. It worked for some, but guess luck is not on my side.
---
No trying or stealing. I was there when fallout 1st released, and you need to know better than to defend the plastic duffel bag company.
---
Isn’t there a blue ridge gas mask you can get as a reward?
---
Possibly.
---
You should get checked out by a therapist
---
That’s a wonderful set of paragraphs that don’t apply to me.
---
Don’t listen to this idiot. Go to your bank. Talk to a broker and get this figured out.
---
This exact reason is why he is welcome to stay at my camp, dude shuts up.
---
Due to the last patch thats a correction not new content/features.
---
The server is shutting down, tho you'll get a 20min timer.
---
Also the workshops don't work properly. Once you claimed and build 3-4 the server will crash without warning and you are unable to rejoin it. Private worlds have a 5min timer once no one is online to be yours.
---
It is worth it imho.
---
* private world, nukes, no rush to get the res for flux
---
* private world, no aggravation about one-shotters
---
* unlimited Stash, craft the ammo when you need it, not to store lead and steel
---
* **1600 atoms monthly, which is about $16**
---
* Survival tent, got overloaded on junk? Just pop the tent and stash it.
---
If you can see yourself playing FO76 for at least 8 months, then go yearly. 8*15=120, and you have 4 months "free".
---
You can still do double sided walls. Just takes some extra steps now. Remember Bethesda didn't remove the double sided wall trick because they didn't want us doing it. Or as a punishment. They did it because a few bad apples were using it to dupe or crash servers.
---
Yes I noticed a few weeks ago the music had changed slightly, that slightly off tune plinky acoustic guitar, yeah?
---
Ok? This is just a silly community event. You don’t need to participate. You act like it’s some reward from a difficult quest/grind.
---
Erectus gets disabled for a different reason than you think. It's  not because they are actively fighting it, it's because when they update the game the menu needs updating too. What would make you think that they did anything to stop Erectus at all? And like I said, the boosting is through cheating. Do you ever wonder why nukawhale and his nuka wench have several characters that way over leveled in NW? Or his friends? Or the guys in fromme? Want me to keep naming more people? You boost this game mode by cheating which plenty of people do.
---
This is the biggest reason for why I didn't purchase FO1st. I don't even care about the resources you get from workshops. I just l want to design multiple areas.
---
But they do listen? Just because they don't fix things the exact way you want it doesn't mean the issue isn't being addressed.
---
Or at the very least make it so you can put in “all” of any given ammo you have.
---
Congratulations bro. I'm trying to get the with my shotty build.
---
True, they also shut down. But the less player on one, the longer it stays up. Me and my wife usually keep one running for 8hrs straight.
---
Or take some self responsibility. I work in the banking sector FYI.
---
Ah, okay.
---
I took one down with just one other dude, and our only problem was running out of ammo. With 8 people, should be pretty easy.
---
And the whole server showing up to SBQ isn't always great, because then you have to compete with the people up on tents and fences for aggro so she'll land, so it'll probably be a comparable fight, time-wise
---
I'd honestly called a *proper* bloodied build one of the actual builds in the game. It requires an actual decent set of Unyielding and a combo of perks designed to jack your endurance, avoid damage entirely with like half of the attacks directed at you, and mitigate the rest. The end result is a player that's actually as tanky as a normal player and can dish out absurd amounts of damage while making use of Nerd Rage, Dodgy, Serpendipity, and Blocker to mitigate any problems.
---
There is indeed.
---
I believe it depends on the following
---
Do you buy atoms?
---
Do you play a lot?
---
Do you have multiple characters?
---
If yes to all of the above, then I'd say possibly yes, if not then no. Either way, wait until the next exclusive item or discount comes out &amp; then try it.
---
Cool, this post isn't going to be deleted by me, sorry. 
---
I like that you can wear the mask with hats too. Would just be nice to see things like this get fixed so the game actually has polish since stability will always be an issue. They fixed the Screaming Eagle hand clip right? Same concept.
---
Lol, that wouldn't be legal - it'd get the game banned in several states and countries because you can buy atoms with real $.
---
Nothing really. The new event with the wendigo is pushed so that’s not available. You can donate steel to brother hood but we completed that. And now you can get legendaries from events and dailies like the fixer or secret service armor as long as you know the plan
---
I want Dogmeat.
---
I thought it was a meta-commentary on the game itself, like most of Beth's stuff. Not everyone contributes, not everyone who does contributes equally, and we all get something we didn't really want.
---
They're nothing if not self-aware AF and master trolls. TBH I think the abuse is what keeps me playing the games for almost three decades. Horse armor is a legendary meme now. The free drop bag is NYLON. Well played, Todd.
---
Bethesda reminds me of a line from the Howard Stern semi-biography movie.. people who like Stern listen to him on average 3 hours a day, to see what he'd do next. People who hated him listened on average 4 hours a day, same reason: to see what he'd do next. That's Bethesda. Even when I'm throwing the controller down I want to see what they're going to do next.
---
Cork
---
No doubt. I guess I'm coming from a slightly different perspective than a lot of players. I bought the game when it came out and quit pretty quickly for lack of content. I came back right before seasons, and I've just loved everything they've added since the initial game launch. Love the NPC quests and new events, and premium camp items seem to be easier to get without paying real money. Some of the bugs are annoying, but there is just so much enjoyable content that I don't mind waiting for fixes to come about. As I mentioned in another comment, even if they aren't implementing the exact suggestions of the community, it seems like the devs at least try to hear people's concerns. I'm sure they have limits to what they can actually release.
---
Not really, its a gacha machine, which is not gambling - its similar, but not legally or otherwise gambling. Gambling is currency in currency out, and that's what I want, but for fake currency (caps).
---
We need a bit more information :)
---
It also depends on you overall perky and special points, as well as the legendary effect you are using. Oh, and your level and that of the mobs is important.
---
His name is Rex and the fact that no one can remember his name is why Dogmeat will forever be superior.
---
Maybe you are getting downvoted because you could just submit a bug ticket rather than throwing a temper tantrum. Also the fact that the build they showed at quake con has it working properly would indicate the problem has already likely been addressed.
---
Awww wittle didums didn’t get the updoots you wanted and wemoved the post? Cwy time 😂
---
Yep, I play private all the time. Never had one shut down on me for server maintenance and I've never had a problem with workshops either. At the end of the day though, it's your money. What platform you on?
---
I went and found it and it works and everything, it'd be super simple -- like one day's work of one member of the coding team to make it functional for caps in/caps out.
---
&gt;there is a gem under all those turds
---
I absolutely agree. Such potential squandered. 
---
You could see some talented people put good work into the game. Absolutely loved the Order of Mysteries questline. Think it ranks as one of Bethesda's best. The DMV one was sublime. There's some fabulous voice acting too.
---
Though, I'm curious as to why the person I was responding to felt that way. You and I seem pragmatic enough to extract the fun parts of the game and to stop when it ends but that person continues regardless, despite how terrible they acknowledge things are.
---
You paid full price for a AAA game, that has a subscription and a cash shop. If you’re satisfied you don’t understand the value of a dollar or the concept of holding companies to be responsible for putting out a working product. This is not an open beta. The fixes that have been prioritized are laughable and there is a lack of transparency. I for one have modded Bethesda games and have an idea of what it takes to actually resolve some of these issues. This is not okay.
---
Bethesda was my favorite gaming company. Maybe not anymore, but I still want to see the job I know they are capable of doing and that isn’t unreasonable. Just because you like something doesn’t mean you can’t critique it, stop being a fanboy.
---
Yup I have this happen off and on. The other one I get is I kill the level 1 ghoul well before it gets to me but it hits me anyways and then falls over dead. I assume that one is latency, seems like everything has a slight lag, but the full health restore is real annoying.
---
I act like I want content(Not grinds) that I can sink my teeth in and enjoy. I want story, I want to make new NPC friends, I want new tradable weapons and armor. Basically I want what we keep telling Bethesda we all want like an end to daily limits and freedom to explore at my own pace. I want that traditional Fallout experience with all the new technology gooey goodness. But who am I kidding I'll be back when the Cubs when the superbowl.
---
They are people and they are trying to do their jobs...and they are FAILING.  Not just today, but for YEARS now.  Consistently.  Predictably.  That needs to be addressed and the only way it gets addressed is by letting them know that their failures are not acceptable to the people that pay for their products.
---
Ah yes, the river water yells about its own swiftness.
---
You get it. All these cute little suburban houses are a blight on the landscape. They stick out like a sore thumb. Sure, we’re rebuilding America or whatever, but I reckon we’d save building upper class McMansions for **after** the minigun toting monsters and fucking dragons were wiped out...
---
Divide that by the number of times it will miss in vats and you get 100 per hit average!
---
Joking! Just building out a bow build but it’s frustrating as hell .. how can I miss 4 95% vat chances from 10 feet ..
---
I also been playing since beta but prob had like 6 months away from game and came back last October. I never messed with perk loadouts and stuff just wanted to carry a bunch. But I changed my play and all my perks as soon as a legendary dropped a 2 star bloodied combat rifle. I was already set up for bloodied being I have the perk for my strength with more rads. The purveyors sweet ass gave me a bloodied fixer three weeks ago and I for the first time in a long time have switched all my perks so I can get the best damage. With how I have it now I can do 2200 after couple kills. I have two bows I wanna try them out. I have a vampires one and stalkers I believe. I think it will be fun. But congrats on the damage man.
---
I can't do any at all because of the mods I use. I strongly suspect it's IconSorting Tags, which doesn't use a BA2 archive, and requires xTranslator to inject the changes.
---
"Gambling with atoms? Lootboxes here we come!"
---
-Bethesda, Probably
---
They don’t listen they fix a couple small issues even though there’s massive ones and they say they fix it but they don’t.
---
It's probably a good thing.  Hopefully the situation will be improved by the time your power is restored :)
---
Honestly, it feels a bit faster to just hit the VATS button vs that weird delay Gun Fu has anyway.
---
Yes and part their hob is to test or have tested their code! And they literally don’t test..
---
I site the blue loot bag as the most recent blatant example of this. The hit box for it is the same size as the paper bag....
---
I don't know why they don't put every single item name  in the game into a box every one has the same box but the amount is at zero, when you put an item Into the box the zero changes to one. If  Every single person has the same box the lag is gone and can be set up and be stable. It just a spread sheet with every item on basically all that changes is the numbers so should work quickly and won't take sever load. And can be account wide.
---
Normally I’m just there for the event xp lol
---
Classic Bethesda not testing their shit.
---
I'd be willing to bet the "fix" Bethesda will make would be to correctly position it with the wallpaper but have it floating off the way when there is no wallpaper.
---
Yeah that doesn't sound like fun, it sounds more like you're in addictive cycle with the little points the game is giving you (rep/gold/scrip/caps/whatever).... :(
---
Same with the mirror to on the tiled walls.
---
[https://ibb.co/DRBqp76](https://ibb.co/DRBqp76)
---
You are going to get story when the brotherhood arrive. Did you see the roadmap? This is similar to the clean up Appalachia event last year in advance of wastelanders. Again, it’s just supposed to be a fun community event.
---
How will I get my 1* nocturnal pool cue?!
---
It's been deleted what did they say
---
I'm more concerned with the shots that "hit" the target, display a damage number, cause it to stagger...but don't seem to have actually reduced its health...
---
Or the ones that do reduce its health only to see it rubber band back to full...
---
Honestly the only two collectrons I need/want I have the fasnacht one for royal jelly/drinks and the christmas one for presents(worthless as they are now with Bethesda lack of authority) the others dont interest me.
---
I was wondering why you got downvotes. Then i read your second paragraph.
---
Did you try jumping into water?
---
Well, considering both new games will run on the same decades-old engine, I'd say we're in for a treat.
---
Pretty much hahaha
---
I thought they did it because they hate the players and have never played the game before?
---
/s
---
Anything "Unarmed". Mole miner gauntlet, Power fist, or Deathclaw gauntlet will be max damage. A good one would be whatever prefix you desire (Bloody, Junkies, Anti Armor, etc) and secondary +40% swing speed.
---
Yes. There are videos from PTS from people who kill it under a minute solo.
---
Im aware of that. To say Bethesda isn't doing anything isn't correct aswell, but who cares - its not the point.
---
Sure the people hack, but using a 3rd party hack isn't the same as boosting on private non pvp nw servers. Not everyone will or can use these tools.
---
You want to have private nw servers, I tell you that it's a bad idea since it will obviously split the game mode and makes it even harder to find lobby's among every excavator noob will have all rewards making it less attractive for engaged people trying to achieve something.
---
Everything else is just a discussion past the topic, since we all know there are hacker and cowards among  predators. Oh, and ppl having some sort of fun... I guess?
---
Or perhaps the build at Quake is an OLD build from before they broke it? :)
---
I'm pretty positive that it was chosen as the clunky terminal specifically to slow us down on ammo conversions in order to retain value for things like actually crafting ammo, and going out finding ammo, and grinding raider rep for the ammo machine, etc.
---
baseball bat with heated coil....   most advanced players would probably make one free for you
---
okay sweaty.
---
I had this happen, body went right over the fence into a non-playable area. I stayed in the area walking around for about 5 minutes when she fell out of the air at my feet and I was able to loot her. I'm pretty sure I got a lead pipe 😄
---
I stopped watching the roadmap entirely with this one because they didnt see the last two to fruition and Bethesda....Bethesda never changes.
---
I don't know why this person is telling your the servers shutdown after 20 minutes. They most certainly do not .
---
I have almost 700 unopened blueprints last time I checked.
---
the hit boxes on all drop bags are the same so there is power armour that currently stops all physical attacks your point there are god tier iteams if you can make them
---
Yeah, I still don't understand why I miss my first shot Everytime even though it says I have 95% chance to hit. And with all the lag going on right now since the latest update, drawing the bow take a lot of effort when in a heated battle.
---
OH NO! why did i even plan my bathroom? this sucks. :( 
---
idk if you have the red rocket prefab, but almost all lights sink into that ceiling aswell.
---
So close
---
Except they want my junk/loot this time.
---
The thing is, they planned such a thing pre release. Shitstorm from other games gone serious so they removed it, almost 2 years later we have these lunchboxes as seasonal content you can also pay for.
---
I picked it up when it was on sale right before Wastelanders dropped and I love it, but I can understand criticism where it's due.
---
Maybe I'm lucky and most of the bugs, etc either don't get me or aren't applicable to how I play; maybe the complaints are overblown; or maybe I give the game too much benefit of the doubt because I don't know the first thing about programming and assume it's just the cost of doing business.
---
Anyway, I bought the game, and I feel I got my money's worth, so I can't be too mad.
---
you're not wrong. i came back to the game this week and had a blast, til today when I realized that it's still Fallout 76.
---
I also have a two shot one but never use it being half the ppl I fight there health will stay at that sliver and I gotta go back at them to kill. I just keep it because maybe one day it will be worth it
---
What about gta online?
---
You can buy gta$ for cash and gamble inside the casino with it.
---
It depends on what you are looking for. For me, it is worth it for the private world and scrap box. I can confirm that I had a private server up for close to 24 hours. There is a soft limit where your friends can't join after x-hours(like 12 I think?), but I haven't ever kicked me out for being on it too long. So if you just looking for a private world experience without fearing of being kicked, then yes, it will be worth it for you. I also enjoy being able to hored workshops, for the materials but it is sometimes fun to just build random crap at workshops without having to worry about PvP stuff.
---
You don’t need to participate and you still get the rewards
---
I still after 800 hours haven’t encountered that bug either
---
Either way submit a ticket lol
---
This is one of the best suggestions I've read. I really hope they do something like this.
---
As good as that sounds the whole process of nuking someone is only costing you, not them. You will have to spent nuke card, ammo, possibly stims and lastly time to launch. Only to have them leave the server before hit.
---
But the prefix paints the picture that this is a *junkie's* gun. It fits in their hands, it reminds them of that time they traded it for fifteen Psycho's. Those weapons be hittin different
---
There realy are no "good places" since legendary enemy spawns occur randomly, and the only real event in danger of one shotting is uranium fever since they are capped at a low lvl, leader of the pack is less popular but also has three legendaries, one violent night, project eden, encryptid, the brahmin one i can't think of the name of atm, campfire all guarantee a leg spawn, and most of the time defending a workshop has one as wel if it's not in or near the forrest.
---
we can speculate, but that doesn‘t change the fact that this and judging from other comments many more objects are broken with the latest update. and really, small example. the lag caused at events is a much bigger problem and literally game breaking, yet some people are still finding excuses. it‘s almost hilarious if it wasn‘t so fucking sad.
---
honestly, i will say from my own experience it is worth it to help stop people from loop scooping your corpse if you died at the Queen event or other like it, since you can quickly deposit  your flux &amp; other junk items into your scrap box from your tent you place / or from others. it kinda sucks that having to have 1st just so people don't take your stuff
---
Take a deep breath and submit a ticket. This seems like a pretty big overreaction IMO. 
---
Also I’m not your... “sweaty”. Wtf
---
Ok. Well fractured steel and steel dawn are supposed to bring more actual questlines.
---
Depends on what you are doing.
---
I can make every private world shutdown within 2mins.
---
They weigh .25 each, if you didn't know and you're wondering what's weighing you down.
---
Not sure what new events you think you're missing out on. Meat Week starts the 18th, and that's the only one I can think of.
---
Dunno why you were downvoted. This is literally the most correct and concise answer in the thread.
---
Who won?
---
I load into servers with 100's of ammo factories at workshops the shit makes too much ammo
---
I understand that but I would rather participate thats the problem. I would also like to see real problems addressed in real timed fixes like a AAA studio and a multibillion dollar franchise deserves.
---
How the hell can you even exit the damn thing? I  have to go back through every screen or am I missing something?
---
I suppose I just consider it a loss then. I won't cheat to keep up with cheaters, so I guess I'll just hope for better things in the future. It's a hard emotion to explain. I want this game to be great, sometimes it is, but it really sucks when it's bad. Too many highs and lows you know?
---
The trick is you create a building team and just before an event finishes switch it to an event team so you get more XP from it, then back to building :) no cool down
---
It just seems to me like newbies need junk way more than high level players and the best way to grief someone is to take away the items they need to craft items and repair their equipment. 
---
The ultimate goal is to make you log off or quit. That’s how they win.
---
I've mentioned it before but I always find it interesting to consider just how influential social media is on our enjoyment.
---
Just for an example; I really enjoy building camps. I'm not very good but I still have a fun time. I've never used or even considered using the double wall glitch or whatever it is called but I find my feelings tainted somewhat because of all the outrage I read on reddit. 
---
 Even small things can be magnified when we users feed off of each other. It's the nature of the beast I know.
---
Nah, totally correct - clearly Yuri from Red Alert 2 has captured the bethedsa staff.

Ah yes I forgot to mention that :) Thankyou

Heck just cash score in for bullion
---
Or Cat for people that want cat meat. oh wait.  
---
a supermutant dog would be amazing also.
---
Ah I see, no idea unfortunately 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
Nothing truly. When you get your power back, you will be able to donate materials to the BOS for the Atlas boxes, and currently, the rewards seem to be the same so no worry there. The only major thing you are going to miss is the free QuakeCon items in the Atom shop since it is only available for this weekend(Aug. 10th is the last day to redeem).

Hey you know why games are full of spaghetti code these days?

Consider the starting salary for an entry level front end web developer: 70k-100k
---
vs. the starting salary for an entry level game developer: 30k-60k
---
Lol, that is the unfortunate general consensus for this group but I'm sure it's not the case.
---
The hit boxes are definitely not the same. They are sized to the object.
---
Out of curiosity have you heard of punctuation?
---
Brotherhood: “Those Residents have given us an over abundance of steel! What are we gonna do with all this steel?!”  
---
Scribe Lyons: “Two words.”

Brotherhood: “We’re not making a giant robot, Scribe Lyons.”  
---
Lyons: *pouts* “When my family runs this bitch, we’re gonna build SO MANY giant robots.”

And they could have made a lot of money with Atomic Shop ammo vendor skins.

I’m brand new to the game, found a player camp and shopped for a bit then sipped from a punch bowl. Screen went 15 different colors and I woke up surrounded by gnomes and a Teddy Fear. No clue what happened at the time
---
I hope and I hope we are all plesently surprised but Im just not as invested now as I was 6months ago and I suspect I will be even less 6mo from now. This is not what I wanted from Fo76 when I bought my year or first and certainly not what I wanted when I ordered my Power Armor edition 2 yrs ago.

hope you enjoy it! if you need help send me a line, I can hook you up with experience consumables and stuff to aid you.

What? QOL on ammo converters? BLASPHEMY....

This is what I do since I'm a bloodied build. I get rid of all rads, heal up completely and tank all of the pylons. I carry 200 super stimpaks with me and spam them as I go. I've found I have more success in completing this event when I just take all pylons myself. Only problem is if people stop killing the robots, damage from the pylons, robots, fire, and her make it really hard to stay alive.
---
I still have to tag her, but it doesn't take much to get a few shots or punches in.
---
Fanbois don't like the word bughesda. Everytime i use it i get downvoted :D It has become a social experiment for me :D

Hold down whatever your back button is

They don't care if you're happy, as long as the numbers are good, THEY are happy. 
---
This season system is a testament to that.

You do realize that about 95% of what they bitch about is valid, right?
---
The set bonus does nothing tbh, but it looks kinda unique.
---
I have two regen pieces, run no mutations, never played bloody, i have never, not once, failed to fast travel, but if health regen IS the cause, i think i'd know by now :/

They didn’t, he’s just being pessimistically speculative.
---
Speaking as someone who works in the game industry: you don't really get to pick the games you work on. You go where the career opportunities are, if you eventually get the chance to land a job at a studio that makes a game you are a huge fan of, you try to stay there for the rest of your career - but most often, that never actually happens, or doesn't happen until you are 20-30 years into your career.
---
I made a post about this the other day, its a real negative subreddit
---
It’s apparently because you previously played nuclear winter in the same game session. Need to quit the game and start again from desktop/console menu. Worked for me at least
---
I take no damage bloodied when firing at my feet with fireproof 3 and no sense chest. This could be it if you are running both. Still breaks limbs yes, so Adamantium Skeleton works as you mentioned in another comment
---
If it was, they wouldn’t still be playing it.
---
Crashing so much since 21 I am playing less. You're not alone.
---
Thanks, I appreciate it.
---
I think at LVL 20 you can get a Mole Miner Gauntlet, it's the strongest weapon you'll likely have at that level for melee, collect the Mole Rat Teet to upgrade it and either do it yourself, or find someone with the perks to do it for you.
---
It works in my opinion based off Fasnacht for sure. The wife and I use one each year to heal robots between waves.
---
For some time, yes. I got it for a month just to hoard some scrap. Now I don't think I'll renew it. If  the survival tents were customizable or had some kind of scrapping table for weapons and armors it would be worth it IMO.
---
This sub is just a fraction of the playerbase. Also, it's usually the same people complaining over and over. Furthermore, the vast majority of posts are not complaints, it just seems that way after patches.
---
All in all, it's a decent game with a good community. Like anything else in the world, it could be better. I enjoy it for what it is and so do most players.
---
It works(fss)
---
Every other game with a “battle pass” has rewards beyond the max tier.
---
That being said, no other game with a battle pass gives you all the content for free.
---
*THAT* being said, there was really not much *content* in the LR. Most of it was consumable shit that is *okay* at best. Fireworks are garbage except for the free reload speed (totally intended feature). Lunchboxes are nice. Atoms here and there, uhh sure not bad. Gold and Scrip..... uhhh wtf. 
---
I just wanted the camp stuff. Outfits were wack. Consumables were very meh. Skins were VERY lackluster. Sheepsquatch plushie? Now that’s fucking quality shit 👌
---
[Have fun!](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_recipes)
---
I think his point is that people complain and then go right back to playing.  I suspect "95% of the complaints being valid" actually makes the behavior of continuing to play more strange rather than less...
---
I’d have to disagree there , I think so many people saw everyone placing camps in whitespring and all did the same , and I know for a fact I was one of the first there for PS4 because I checked whitespring out on launch day and no one had a camp there for a few months . 
---
Everyone copies the next person ... not me but they copy eachother and that’s why it’s a common idea because everyone follows everyone else lol 😂 
---
It’s ok though you can be negative if you like doesn’t bother me you must be a well like person in real life for sure ! 
---
The dollhouse idea is not one I’m taking for my own I’m just saying that everyone is squabbling about how the first fallout doll house was found 11 months ago when actually people have had houses like that way before and it’s gone unnoticed . If it’s not be snapped and uploaded it’s like it doesn’t exsist ! 
---
That goes for anyone’s house idea , I’ve always done lots of house builds and many other people have done things similar ... but the first dollhouse exsisting only counts because it was uploaded ? 
---
I’m just saying that’s it not an original idea there’s people that build for themselves... not for popularity on social media so I don’t think you can say who built the first dollhouse because it’s not traceable . 
---
I’ve seen loads of dollhouses since this “winner dollhouse”... and your telling me people arnt copying eachother? 😂 oook ..
---
What level are you?   At lower levels, melee is best.   At higher, I prefer heavy along with a couple good LMGs for hordes of fast-moving enemies.
---
Ouch
---
20-30k
---
message me when they add pets, i’m not coming back until then 
---
jk don’t message me but nice suggestion! love it
---
Sorry to hear that
---
Swing speed impacts healing with FF
---
Wow, you really want to know what this helmet is hmm?
---
This is my experience and sentiment as well. I understand that bugs are annoying, but the complaints just seem excessive.
---
I will add I have 800 hours in this game. I do love it and yeah it is buggy. But holy fuck if it’s as bad as you complain you wouldn’t still have so many ppl playing and it’s servers would look more like Anthem - where everyone actually stopped playing.
---
Are you talking about yourself?
---
All of my comments persist.
---
Hell yeah
---
Marine armor helmet. The plan was a rare drop during the Treasure Hunter event a few months ago.
---
Not got the plan
---
That's all I've wanted since I finished my t65 set.
---
What the spirit of that phrase means that you treat them like they're right because they have the money. It's an American thing that has  spread to the rest of the world. From the home of popular classics such as obesity and late-stage capitalism.
---
I'll give it a try. Might take a while since i need like 1 million xp (you know what im saying) to rank up once now.
---
10000000% yes
---
Color me intrigued?
---
Including trees ... I wish trees were free :(
---
Bethesda &amp; Zenimax Execs in smoke filled room at table: (laughing) Wait, who are you guys? Get out of here.
---
I'm experiencing more crashes lately as well. I take it as my cue to wrap it up for the day and find something else to do 🤷‍♀️
---
Why are you carrying junk to a public event?  Just stop at your camp and put your stuff away and then go to the event.
---
Problem solved.
---
Have you collected all the rare junk items ? Did you find every colored nurse outfit? Did you get all the secret service armor in your build that you normally had ,or the new power armor ? Did you finish the board game ? Did you hit 100 in nuclear winter ? Did you build a ultimate trap base in adventure , blueprint it ,and trap people in nuclear winter ?
---
With chinese stealth armor I can literally stand in front of any enemy without them noticing me. I can use knives to stab them.
---
For sure.
---
Since I hit 100 I lost motivation since handmade seems to one hit, cheaters who troll from the sky and unstable servers where every few rounds one teammate got disconnected or is crashing.
---
I just made a post about this exact topic. They sound like abused spouses, refusing to leave a situation they hate.
---
True that. I blocked only a couple of people, less than ten that would only comment negative things and the discourse around here became noticably better. For the most part it's just the same few users that have nothing better to do than play a game they claim to hate so much.
---
There are half bloodied-half junkies builds. Adrenal and junkies go together quite nice at 50-80%, and you have the bloodied perks (serendipity/nerd rage) to save your ass when you get hit hard. Not saying it's that build, but there are partial bloodied builds.
---
wait
---
Yes there's plenty to complain about. Yes the game can be a buggy mess at times. All that is valid and needs to be addressed by Bethesda.
---
But there's one major component that keeps me coming back, the other players. This is the first online game I've ever played where I've generally got along with other players. I don't feel constantly surrounded by griefers or assholes spamming voice chat with hateful bullshit. 
---
That's why I keep playing and you don't get to declare the reasons people should play or not.
---
If Bethesfa were to add proper refrigeration, we could sell our dishes and drinks without fear of them going off in the vending machine. I'd love to be able to sell cranberry cobblers and s'mores!
---
Also a Stalker's/Nocturnal week, where every other legendary effect except these two is disabled. And negative effects are extreme when the conditions are not met, so you'll do approximately zero damage at daylight in combat!
---
Does... it give you a headache? Haha
---
LOL. That’s hilarious
---
It seems to make up a small percentage of posts.
---
I agree that after 100 there should be some kind of rewards. But on the other hand it seems there is a large number of players who either bought their way to 100 or grinded unnecessarily early on to rush through the season, and are now bored because of it. 
---
I mean I grow tired of the dailys and grinding, but I'm fairly well on track to complete the season and level 100 without spending my precious atoms and I haven't even logged in daily.
---
Gonna throw this out there but I’d be willing to bet some of the post threatening to quit playing and urging others to quit as well and complaining don’t even play this game at all . There’s a lot of trolls and karma whores in the world my man . Not saying everybody posting but definitely some .
---
One thing to emphasize, you have to complete the quest first, before the plan will drop.
---
So if you still have the quest open (not completed) and join someone else's Encrypted event, you are not eligible to get the plans as a drop.
---
Its worth it for sure.  Just the atoms alone are worth the 18 bucks let alone private server and scrap box saves your ass daily and is super useful and bottomless scrap box isn't the best thing ever what is? My private server never goes down and I can use it to drop items from char to char and have never lost an item. Knock on wood. Beat that.
---
Good lord, I haven’t known I needed that until now
---
I don’t mean to hijack the post but I’m brand new to the game and I’ve been trying to find out: where and how do I donate steel and what rewards are in for me if I do?
---
It’s part of the game, stop carrying junk to an event and stop complaining
---
Scooby-Doo and Shaggy have some words for you...
---
the first person to put it on youtube wasn't the first person to do it either. he just sees people do cool things, calls it his own, and posts it on youtube.
---
the rewards or loot you gather at the public events is the reason, when you do scorch earth you get about 6 flux plus whatever you have looted off of the corpses of the creatures you kill i.e acid, adhesive etc. its sad that it makes it a most to have 1st just so you can fix a issue where as if they made it give a person a bounty at least it add some recourse to it &amp; alittle pvp fun for people
---
I don’t think I’ve put a regular suit of PA on since I started finding weight-reducing legendaries and backpack mods. 
---
I top out a carrying capacity of about 315lb in regular gear with a backpack. Filled up and switched to Excavator as a test, and it came out around 425lb. Extreme example, but still.
---
By the time I’m done faffing with my stash to be able to move in PA, the SBQ is often dead, which is a shame.
---
Reminded by this thread to stick calibrated shocks on my Excavator, if I haven’t already - ta!
---
Fireproof perk.
---
Sry, I don't want to explain this :)
---
I hear you on this. When something happens and so many posts are the same repetitious griping, its certainly irritating. I either don't read, bc why would I ruin my time, or downvote. Good luck out there outlander.
---
Of course no worries
---
On the plus side, the "fixed" Settler quest isn't fixed, so you can still turn it in without doing the quest. By now, my formerly much worse settler reputation is close to max, while I still have lots of boring raider bullshit to do to get to ally. So at least they're somehow consistent in fucking things up.
---
I absolutely love to build in this game and my friend and I are new so we hop from camp to camp looking for affordable plans to build with and I gotta say god bless people like you.
---
I have this problem too.
---
One thing I'd like to add, more an observation really, is that Bethesda is in a bind given it has two exceptionally good product lines that both went from a solo experience to an MMO... 
---
Elder Scrolls Oblivion and Skyrim- both fantastic and highly memorable. I won't digress with Morrowind and earlier. 
---
Fallout 3, NV and 4- well, I don't need to explain much there.
---
Then there's ESO, where the world of Tamriel gets shook up in the name of 'balancing' multiple times a year it feels and you truly can't actually play how you want, as some things are horribly weak at end game. It's so meta driven if you're NOT the meta you won't actually be tolerated in some content. They'll just kick you. You can use first person perspective as it'll end you to aoe damage, despite me playing ALL of Oblivion in first person. 
---
We have Fallout 76, where the basics of home building are having some issues right now, and where there's really only one way to be properly powerful. Due to managing the player base and issues, things have to be time gated etc. Decisions were made with the product that havent say well as it's an MMO and thus an evolving beast. 
---
BOTH GAMES REDDIT COMMUNITY HAVE STRONG OFTEN NEGATIVE OPINIONS. I do believe though, there's some justification in it.
---
For me personally, I do wonder why both titles went for an MMO when historically they were both single player games and the MMO experience didn't really port that well.
---
Should of nuked the base if possible
---
Or how about like the brew stations?  Deposit ammo one side.  Wait on it to process, ammo come sour ready for collection
---
Are you connected by Ethernet? Cause if you are, that's a Bethesda problem, if you aren't, and you're far away from the router, that's a you issue
---
This must have been embarrassing for her hopefully it get this fixed but I seriously doubt it
---
I'm that guy disconnecting when the servers get bad. It sucks, but I'm lucky to have people who back out of the lobby and wait for me to relog. The handmade got a clip size nerf in Adventure, I don't see what not in NW, it is very strong esp with Master Commando and Tank  Killer. Add chems in there, ouch.
---
Because people are a\*\*holes.
---
no one carries junk to a event, its gather at the event &amp; why not make it a bounty? people to scare to fight to jack others stuff? hell i feel like the pvp community would love another chance to get people to engage
---
Yeah, but not the *other other* fast travel bug or the *other other other* fast travel bug.
---
That might work for stackable items, such as aid or junk, but most likely not for items with unique characteristics. Weapons and armor need information related to mods, legendary effects, player-assigned alias, and item condition, all of which result in a ridiculous number of combinations. Storing a unique entry for every possible combination on a remote server host as a giant lookup table would likely lead to significant lag and a comedy of errors related to new bugs.
---
Actually only affects healing NPCs. If you shoot a teammate with a flamer, it will heal them. At least it does with my explosive flamer.
---
Nah, make a week where it's never daytime. "Nocturnal week"
---
Fallout 152?
---
&gt;I’ve heard about these dollhouses and I was doing it way before Bethesda even knew about it , then someone else gets credit ...
---
Sure sounds like you are trying to take credit for it.
---
Checking the plan should work, as they already have a similar mechanic in use at the crafting stations.
---
Johnyy...johnyy guitar
---
Just let us scrap ammo into junk and make what we need! Simpler than this shit converter.
---
I'mma let you finish, but the Power Fist is the greatest weapon of them all.
---
Sounds like an issue on your end...
---
I’m new ish to the game (played on launch and have only come back now) and this happened to me then and it’s happening to me constantly now, Especially sneak attach headshots with my sniper that inflict heavy damage
---
Possibly but it would just be a word doc or spread sheet with every single thing on if they all the same only the number of each item would change ie how many you have in box just a thought im no programmer but I appreciate your feed back
---
This is hilarious, because I have the opposite problem. I'm selling multiple Fixer plans and literally cannot shift them. Nobody's interested.
---
What platform?
---
What kind of network connection?
---
Not very single gltich is Bethesdas problem.
---
vampire/swing speed bowie/switchblade.  
---
At your level balancing dmg from the monsters, you hit fast enough that you'd be nearly invincible.
---
I'm just hoping for a sell/buy max option
---
Just give me a damn slider like when I drop stuff. Why is that stupid thing so over complicated
---
Yeaaaa I’m level 41 and they were 40. I doubt I would have been able to lol but great idea either way
---
I just want to apply my BOS elder paint. I grinded for that, for a long time.  
---
Since they made the T-60 no terribly good, maybe let me use the skin on something else?
---
Yupppp
---
Yeah I'm getting alot of disconnects and lag on xbox the past few days, yesterday was really bad.
---
Keep it on all the time unless you want every possible mutation. Trust me, there are some you want to avoid depending on what your build is
---
They said it will be available to grab off the atomic shop at some stage after we hit the goal, could be the next day, could be the next week, next month or next year, I don't think they specified.
---
Its on xbox with xfinity high speed. It didn't lag like this until after that last update.
---
Even if you report them with video proof nothing will happen to them,especially if they are FO 1st members,i have caught people cheating in the act with video, i have photos of people that leveled to 2000 using the godmode glitch and wearing level 100 legendary run awards at the 2nd day of the event and they are still in the game, i have pics of people selling in their vendor unyielding sentinel pieces of P.A and they are still in the game, this is a joke company, i dont even bother reporting anymore, i cancelled my FO 1st and i stopped playing,i have no incentive to play anymore because hard grinding and cheating gets equally rewarded.
---
Most die-hards are just being cathartic. 
---
If you like this game and play often you get put through a lot of stress with all the buggy stuff and glitches.
---
Because playing fallout 3 new Vegas and fallout 4 gets old. That's why people play fallout 76. Oh and They fucked the game up big time so the so called 95% of players have every right to moan about the game that has a miserable existence in comparison to its predecessors.
---
you can't steal queen flux from a loot bag.  It is a change they made.  If you die after the queen, the flux is lost.  No one gets it.
---
This process could be so easy.  You use the terminal and it reads how much ammunition you have then asks which to exclude so it won’t exchange the ammo you use. Once exclusions are chosen you choose which ammo you want and it makes the exchange automatically. Quick and easy
---
I’m tired of seeing post about “can you please raise the stash limit” or other silly stuff like that, we’re lucky they raised it to 800. These people shoulda played when it was only 400, that was a challenge.
---
I think that would be an awesome mod.
---
Starts playing if you sneak around and the status goes to CAUTION.
---
Plays faster and faster as it shrinks.
---
Happens to me in real life now and then ;)
---
The router is right next to the xbox and yes I am connected. I pay extra for faster internet just to game. All my other games run normally.
---
Thank you
---
Aaaaaaaaaand Exploit.
---
I think much of the reason why we cant have pratical things os because of How exploitable the game is.
---
I blame both Bethesda and the comunity. Bethesda because their code and engine is Scorchbeast guanno. And the comunity because they cant help themselves when they get the smallest whiff of a Exploit.
---
Whatever you use, make sure you use the right perks (barbarian, slugger, unarmed, etc) as well as the armor penetrating perk if you have it
---
I checked and all my other online games play without lagging. This happened after the last update so I'm not so sure it's completely my internet that sucks.
---
Nice and totally on budget haha
---
Build the best camp you’ve ever seen. This will involve learning dozens of build glitches and applying them in your own unique way
---
Outside of events? No
---
Damn I just dropped two. You can get them from workshop events.
---
Yeahhhh I unlocked it a few days ago and was disappointed. I got it to work though (but it took some finesse.)
---
They drop from events I know that. I’ve got several up for sale
---
Well for one im sure i get detected when i stand in a bright light. But then there are many times where i just get spotted in darkness with no enemies around.  Im 3x higher than mobs in jail and pretty much all times i got spotted out of nowhere was with enemies atleast 10lvls lower than me.   Atm i have jumping and speed mutations. and have two pieces of armor with improved sneaking in dark places all modded with shrouded.   And im asking this cos i have been in brighter places with enemies almost breathing on me and not spotting with only caution sign and then times where i get danger in alot darker places with enemies not even close by or in line of sight.
---
They will do that but not the queen and other bosses? Last night I ran into a rare event when the queen and colossus were spawned simultaneously and fought each other. Killed both when there was only 20 seconds left. The queen dropped a one star ghoul slayer shishkabob and the colossus dropped a one star nocturnal golf club. The pathetic loot really cheapens those ‘endgame bosses’.
---
Are you on PC or console?
---
All I can say is I have seen a second of lag here or there, never this.
---
It makes me chortle when someone says " I stopped playing and cancelled fo1st"....yet you still come here to comment, just let go buddy you can do it.....
---
Ok. Any locations that may have a legendary? Im trying to finish my dailys before they reset and its just 2 hours.
---
Im goin for that armors plans, but tought that wooden armor is a top gear for sneaking.
---
Fissure sites usually have them but mostly 1\*
---
I always FT to Watoga station and every time when I spawn there SB's drop there.
---
Are you on PS4? My username is the same as here on Reddit so add me if you wish (send me a message so I know it's you) and I'll buy some!
---
it can be even easier select an ammo select what you wanna convert it into and it does the math round for round till you tin out
---
Not sure if the drop rate is down or not as I didn't get too many today either. I definitely did get some though. PS4 also.
---
There's a bug in VATS I believe with the bow that if you don't draw it all the way the first shot will miss.  
---
That being said I'm in the same boat as you.  I've been playing since release and only hit 193 last night, but I've been using an Instigating Deathclaw Gauntlet build, and the numbers can get silly with 4.9k crits.  It's the best part of the game when you cross that threshold of being able to stand with the higher ability players.
---
From what others have said, karma will come for the people with the Ammo collectors, since when you scrap them, they continue to occupy part of your build budget - forever.
---
According to the [database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GSBbydRo8dbqZP0iXdGXg3RYat8k4qljPcW50tR_El8/htmlview?usp=sharing#), you can find the Plan at Free States/Watoga Station Vendors, along with Grahm. Best of luck :)
---
For me, yes!
---
I purchase a lot of atoms so that alone warrants the price. 
---
I also spend a lot of time looting locations and scrapping the junk so it’s handy for me to have the survival tent that I can set up outside and use as a quick deposit for my junk.
---
I do use the private server but not often, mostly for challenges to claim a workshop so it’s 0 hassle! Or if I just want to explore an empty server without coming across other players.
---
I have pretty good luck with Fort Defiance spawning anywhere from 1-3. Doesn't happen every time, but definitely worth a shot to check.
---
Server hop till you hit a uranium fever. Usually takes me about 10 mins.
---
Grind out west tek or whitespings, high chance for legendaries because of how many enemies there are
---
It’s the same reason Stockholm Syndrome is a thing.
---
I did! Afterwards my friends and I gave a couple stimpacks to the dude for being a good sport
---
Nothing at all. Just a really disappointing update.
---
There were warnings all over this sub about this very issue for a while. The best way to avoid this issue and still use the generators was setting them up at workshops. Too bad anytime this was brought up it was viewed as encouraging exploits and people were banned on this sub for even suggesting a non-permanently harmful way. Mods in this sub are dog shit and have screwed players without realizing it.
---
Yeah I thought it got patched but I got it to work after a couple attempts
---
we beta players are the "angry old men complaining about walking uphill to school both ways" crowd apparently.
---
This happens to me every now and then as well
---
Is it the number displayed on screen when you hit the target?
---
Keep a look out for leader of the pack (3 guaranteed). Same with uranium fever. 
---
Any horde event has a guaranteed one. 
---
Whitespring and west tek are good spots to run through also
---
Leader of the pack has 3
---
Whitesprings golf club I've found 4 there on multiple occasions or do horde events
---
You can make really cheap flamer fuel as well this way. It's more economical to produce almost any other ammo type and turn it into flamer fuel rather than crafting it directly.
---
What changes did they make regarding the issue you’re talking about?
---
It was done before... It was called Survival mode but Bethesda deleted it from the game.
---
I've been having the same problem as you ever since the update
---
There's a bridge like that in the hills that overlook the National Isolated Radio Array, it spans across a little stream and there's a shack on one side. It seems like the Array is sort of on your right side, if you're at the bridge looking toward The Mire.
---
Happened to me once.. Also all my displays went back into my stash as well. Thankful it only happened once and never again.
---
Desperation for the IP, been with it since BETA, and FOMO.  Live services alone psychologically break you down.
---
Xbox
---
What about Railway spikes. With Ammosmith 49 Steel gets 100 .50 cal
---
That doesn't factor in super duper.
---
Holy crap, Fireproof is doing something again!
---
I am on PS4. Ill contact you. You can have it for free.
---
You guys ready to farm golf balls?
---
Yes to much god damn clicking
---
........so a bit like the ammo press from The Pitt. ;)
---
but really so many better ways to do it, it's like they put the new guy on it or something.
---
Im a developer, backend for IoT though. Some of the stuff they pulled is inexcusable. The underlying problems they have with server and client comms are obvious but it's their fault they released in such a state. It's not the consumers obligation to learn coding and understand their issues, consumers pay for a finished product/service. I understand their problems and what you're trying to let others know but I honestly don't care. I gave money for a product, not to finance their next scram.
---
Disclaimer - English is a second language for me.
---
Bogtown workshop usually spawns a legendary and behind Freddy's at the basement entrance there's usually a legendary. Those are the first two places I try. There's also a mirelurk queen that spawns at cranberry bog but that one isn't as reliable. The others are 80% chance of bagging a legendary.
---
In the same boat here. No power until Tuesday
---
Wowee that sucks at least I'm not going crazy and there really is an issue. And I really do love this game too it sucks to see it in such a state.
---
There is no trick, they nerfed Fireproof so now blasts from our weapons kill us easily. Before last patch I could shoot enemies with any explosive weapon point blank when I had fireproof 3, now it’s instant death. So bring a non explosive weapons for tight spaces, that works best.
---
Go for it!  The mantle of Cactus Man transcends individual bounty hunters
---
ahh, i wasn't aware of that something good to know, though still you do gather resources while at the event. i figured posting a fun solution to this instead of blank complaining would be more constructive but thanks for replying back with info instead of the flaming &amp; generic response
---
No one is worried about concrete too?  If someone can suggest a good way to farm it (beyond 400 a day), then I might be able to chill out.
---
Took me 4 days to build my house ... restarted 3 times all because of .... you guessed it .... Stairs.
---
Non removable stairs that lead to thin air that will never be moved or deleted because ... you won’t be able to access the sky and that’s NEVER ALLOWED !  Floating walls and objects is fine ... but to move stairs from one side of a floor tile to the other .... nope ! 
---
Then it would not let me place wall around the upstairs ... because it was intersecting with objects ?... objects that didn’t exsist !
---
If you can’t snap a wall to a floor tile how can you build a house 😂
---
Half a week of my life spent on building a house in a fallout game ... I’m NEVER rebuilding my house again ! 
---
I think I’ll stick to sims for house building 😂 at least it’s not broken
---
Money really isn't an issue for me, I just hate server hopping for maint. And if private dosnt do that for an 8+hr session I would definitely get it
---
Am I the only one that really hates the way that looks? It’s the apocalypse, why is it so pristine and modern?
---
*Chuckles in bloodied melee*
---
The new one has a 20 minute time limit, if you're not doing serious damage you'll run out of time
---
This night will last forever! :-)))
---
Now I don't want to give Bethesda too much credit, but they did manage something in Fallout 76 that I never thought would happen in this engine. That being we can get away with
---
Depends on your system
---
Overencumbering garbage?
---
Every game from F3 had nude patches...
---
I've had some great luck with transferring items lately. I picked a location that isn't that popular that has a bunch of containers and I've been using it for a while on public servers. With all of the traffic at the Purveyor, you run the risk of your things getting discovered as well as whatever server load issues might arise, pick a spot that no one has any cause to go to and use that spot.
---
Just not my spot, because I'm not telling.
---
I want a red wallpaper 😭
---
&gt;*New players come in and buy a few Atom Store bundles, then move on - whereas old players spend like maybe 300 Atoms a week if that.* ***Player turnover is more profitable than player retention.*** *Atom Store content is more profitable than fixing bugs that are nearing two years old.*
---
This right here is the bane of most live service games. Sadly, they're not wrong. New players spend more and they get more money from older players who quit and subsequently return.
---
Anytime you're on and want to hop into a private server shoot me a message and I'll invite you.
---
I’ve never had the Queen do that for me. I’ve seen normal Scorchbeast do it, but never the Queen
---
I do like it.  
---
Like any player we can deal with things we don't like and still enjoy any game. "lol".
---
It has a (now weak) damage aura and applies a DoT to attacks.  The defence on all PA is basically the same so IMO it is still the best option
---
This is not happening with me on PC. Maybe this is an xbox issue.
---
suggestion for u:
---
create ur own game and do whatever u want.
---
"is takes ungodly amount of time"  = 5 min max.
---
Um no. You can’t just have access to take every workshop without contention just because you don’t want to PVP.
---
PS4 has to create a backup file to do the update, or something along those lines. PS4 sucks for updates
---
One Xbox you have to hold down the B button, found out about the hard way.
---
There's not 'special' about the pack other than it looks different has a higher max level weight limit. It was just another quest reward. Kind of a let down.
---
Build time allocation: 80% getting the first piece exactly right so you can properly surround the pylon. 20% for everything else. 
---
I can appreciate the difficulty of this build.
---
Oh no, in a game where level ultimately dosn’t even matter after a certain point i’m getting 45% less XP.  How will I ever go on knowing that now?
---
it said specifically 8-13 on ps4. let alone the fact that all together i need 101.55 free
---
Don’t any skins that apply to ALL power armor work? The ones that do a full retexture.
---
Put a paratrooper bag down, you can access it at the edge of the bag. If u put a paper bag down, again you can only access it at the edge of the bag. Therefore they much be different sizes as the bags are different sizes.
---
You ever get a melody stuck in your head? One day, I'm gonna write a song that does that. *plays guitar riff for 10 billionth time
---
I figured it might have been something like that.  It stands to reason that Asbestos would be somewhat OP if it negated fire entirely, but at the same time, the player can't appreciate the difference between the two, or where the direct damage ends an the DoT begins.
---
Nice. I want to get a nice archer like that. I saw an instigating one at a vendor but they wanted 14,000 caps.... alas...
---
It would be nice to use any armor skin in NW (if you have anything equipped, don't unequip it or you cant apply it again!)
---
Also it would be amazing to throw the ghillie on special armors while we are at it (solar/thorn that are scout armor)
---
would be a good idea to find away to get more people whom are interested in pvp on the same server i.e like traditional mmo generally do
---
Is it a PC issue?
---
Any idea why they can't have it auto award when the minimum is met?

(I already know the answer)
---
You are the chosen one
---
Haha just get low speed internet like me and get use to the lag for everything
---
Ahhh you are on PS4. 
---
So PS4 does this weird thing where they require you to have space to cover both the patch and enough space to backup the game. So even though the patch is less than 10gb, you need a lot of space. That’s the same for any game btw
---
How now brown cow?
---
I get the point you’re trying to make, but I’m not sure where you’re finding entry level front-end web developer positions for $70-100k.  Maybe Silicon Valley?
---
Anyway, Rockville, MD where they’re located for web developer is $40-70k
---
10000000000000% agreed. Converting 1500 rounds of .45, 12 rounds at a time is a major ball ache.
---
I use a compound bow and all I do is I enter vats, get out of it and enter it again and my shot hits every time
---
I always have a few orbital strike grenades for this event to clear a path.
---
Noticed this the other day, it stayed at same amount for hours, like not a single person donated scrap during ng that time.
---
I have a spare Fixer plan for sale/trade on PS4, PSN is the same as my username, Just send me a message if you're interested.
---
Same.  My very first dollhouse build was fallout 4.  It's not stealing, each one has its nuances.
---
This is what mental illness looks like lmao
---
Stellar response.
---
Bloodied has so many synergistic effects you can employ with it that it is not surprising.  Its an easy button build with little downside so its very popular.  If ti is ever nerfed there will a great cry in the wasteland of megatonic proportions.
---
Really dude, thanks, I’m still gonna try to get the plans but that’d help a lot, I’ll dm u
---
Nice catch. I wonder if they fixed any of the others that are broken
---

---
Miner miracles quest for the excavator power armor and power armor workbench plan (if you haven’t done that one yet).
---
There are no alternatives to 76.  It is pretty unique.
---
They should get rid of the ugly terminal and make the blue thing work as a scrip machine. E) = 'Scrip' ammo. And R) = Buy ammo.
---
I really enjoy the game just wish it was better I really haven't played another game for months. Just some of the things the devs are doing and way things are implemented are seriously like what the actual frick. Let make it complicated as all hell when there's a completely easier way.
---
Personally I only buy it for a month at a time here and there... Usually depending on how much I plan on playing. Again I don't know why the other person wants you to believe the private servers just shutdown. You can spend an entire day on a single private server if you want and it will not just shutdown on you. You'll also get the same server back if you log out or hard crash as long as you log back in with 5-10 minutes. People use this to transfer items between characters and respawning mobs for farming. When I want to farm flux stablizers I nuke WS on a private server. You can clear out the glowing ones, log out, log back in and it will respawn all the ghouls for again.
---
I like the game, I ignore the Bethesda hate speeches and just get on this sub for Q&amp;A, I say if u want perfection wait for cyberpunk to come out in a few years
---
can i skip the backup?
---
For the first time anywhere, i and my team experienced severe lag during most of radiation rumble yesterday. It was so bad, we couldn't functionally play and the mission failed. Sucks too becuase we had a squad of high level hammers and were definitely going to 100% that thing.  Not sure why, but it was definitely not my connection speed that was responsible.
---
Eh.......    
---
I saved up over 1500 of 10mm rounds b/c I was planning on using it. I turned in Cold Case after level 50 and got a max level "Perfect Storm". Modded it and went out killing things like an insane pyromaniac.    
---
It should have a separate stash and there is a Convert option and it doesn't do it automatically. That way you don't accidentally SPAM dump ammo you need by mistake.
---
You mean you can purposely crash the server. That's not a shutdown.
---
Just for info purposes, if youre doing the Legendary Run, the chicken coop yields far more fertilizer and takes up much less room.
---
regen has a different regenerationspeed, maybe it's different and not overhealing so the system won't decrease your health. i think regen is 0.2hp.
---
They dont like to have separate servers? Ok
---
But when you have the option “PvP-ready” enabled, you go to the server where all other players have the one enabled too
---
I don't think so. I had several camps under the map back I the past. Never had any trouble with it
---
You know who hates Fallout more than anyone else? Fallout fans.
---
My first reply was objectively speaking.
---
Subjectively? You caught me. I'm bloodied. My job during the event? I take out all the other mobs, and any time someone goes down, I stim them. When the bot is no longer protected, I wait until I see everyone has tagged it, and then I throw all my damage in to help kill it.
---
So it's not about the cost of stims, I'm still using a couple dozen. Every character has to use their own strengths for the great good. And if I took pylons, I would die quickly, piss off them group, and not be there for support.
---
As for getting legendary and boss kills? That's not bloodied players doing that. That's shitty players doing that. I always switch to a low level Tesla for tagging. For bosses, I just get my minimum damage in, and then I'm on group support. I see plenty of full health players being shitty players and melting their kills too. Blame the individual, not the build.
---
i think his point was if you choose to not have pvp on you couldn't claim a workshop since that is pvp but i agree workshop should be contested
---
If you already know the answer can you share it with the community?
---
That's not an unfair statement, but I'd like to give some IT perspective to it. 
---
First, according to Bethesda the bug they were fixing wasn't a building bug, it was an exploit bug that affected building. So none of this was intentionally expected to affect building, which is one of my favorite things in the game. 
---
Second, to your point, testing was inadequate. There should be a basic build as part of their QA process and all major patches should be released to a beta server before release so your most experienced players can be invited to test changes. This includes new bosses so players can test mechanics. FO is waaaaay too big for an internal QA team testing alone. Players need to be invited to help. Blizzard has done this for eons.
---
Technically, yes, you are using an exploit and can therefore be banned. However I've never heard of it actually happening to anybody. I myself currently have a C.A.M.P. that has an underground section. I got tired of my generator being constantly destroyed by mobs no matter what I did.
---
I was someone of started at launch but quickly gave it up because it just wasn’t enjoyable to me at the time. But recently I wanted to really get into the game, especially with the new Wastelanders content. So I did what I always do when starting a new game, check the subreddit. 
---
Literally almost every thread on the page was complaining about double sided walls. And all of the post were the same “how is this a fix, no one asked for it, Bethesda is shit they always do this, the only thing I enjoyed about this game is ruined forever, why haven’t they responded, they’re so out of touch with the community, I’m quitting.” The kicker were the ones that claimed “false advertising” because they heard someone incorrectly define the term and think everything they’re unhappy with is false advertising. 
---
If I were any other new player seeing this, I’d think it’s a toxic whiny community that I don’t want to be a part of. I know it’s not because I’ve seen a lot of good things happening in this community. But to have hundreds of threads complaining about the same issue, shouldn’t be how the community wants to present itself. 
---
Is the game flawed? Yes absolutely. Are the complaints valid in most instances? Of course. Could they drive some people to quit forever? Sure. I’m not saying complaints shouldn’t be posted here, but when you look at the first page, and everyone’s complaining about the same issue, why make yet another post on the same issue and offer absolutely nothing new? It doesn’t help anyone.
---
All these complaints and suggestions were made like 1 day after it was released. It's clear that they simply ignore the players. Every QOL suggestion seems ignored, and a new mecanic that is terrible or increases grind is released. 
---
How many more timegate/daily "currencies" can they release? How many things can they restrict? Its like its become a perverse contest for them.
---
I hope they fix this soon I'll have to find another game to invest my time in until they do. Which blows because I absolutely love this game.
---
I agree with that. What I'm talking about is how often he says "why isn't X free instead of ATX", "when's the next trailer, speculate on the speculation". They've iterated quite efficiently, with the instancing software that broke for the Raids, such that saying "where is information on the content drop after the next content drop" just encourages MVP to get pushed out the door. That's what happened in 2018. Nobody is at the studio. Give them time for heaven's sake.
---
may spelled it better. i can make every server saying shutdown imminent within 2 mins. only thing i need is a fatman, 50-80 mininukes and a clipglitch.
---
Idk man, you also bitch about people bitching about the game so it fits right in? It's not like it's only one person making all those threads you complain about, and a lot of the critizised points are simply valid.
---
r/fo76FilthyCasuals if you just want a fo76 community that isn't a saltmine.
---
Yeah, I have speed demon with starched genes on
---
True, but imagine being able to offer trading to everyone at the same time and browse all the other portable machines.. Impromptu flea market :)
---
Yes, crappy, annoying inefficient ones.
---
&gt;issue is people are whiners and bitches.  they cant accept RNG awesome drops are rare events (regardless of powerful of boss you took down)
---
I like having to put a few shotgun rounds into vendors or other NPCs first to be able to trigger their dialogue.  But primarily enjoyable on Ward. Best addition of Wastelanders.  😁
---
Unfortunately not, it's integrated as part of the download process.
---
They hacked a few of the Whitespring Robots to help out.
---
According to other posts, it's caused by the [Tesla Rifle when on a laggy server](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i3rq3v/the_tesla_rifle_is_beyond_buggy_and_broken_due_to/).
---
I would also suggest checking the satellite array north of Wes Tek up the road, and Huntersville.  Steakhouse at the border of Cranberry Bog and the Mire has good chance as well.  All of which are mutants which are good for caps, gunpowder, .308, 5.56, and 5mm.  
---
If you see the events Radiation Rumble, or One Violent Night they are also really good for legendary spawns.
---
Lol, I can just imagine the butlers milling about
---
This is a compromise but definitely an option. They could also up-sell the whole Fo1st thing if the survival tent included a small vending machine, maybe 10 item limit.
---
I genuinely have no idea how you’re so far up.
---
I’m about where you are (R75, about 4 spaces ahead). I’ve skipped most of the NW dailies, and lost one day of Double Score dailies to the infamous auto-complete bug. So knocking out 8/9 dailies, plus the weeklies, each day, has put me around where you are.
---
The dailies probably take me an hour, more ore less, depending if they don’t involve, say, finding 3 legendaries. 
---
How you’re managing to do them in half my time, and make up ten days of lost ground in 30 minutes of XP per day...tell me, so I can do it too!
---
Same happened to me at radiation rumble yesterday. I could get a shot or my camera to focus in on an enemy
---
Same.
---
I still don't know whether people just don't care to help with any events, or somehow they just can't read.
---
Im on xbox
---
You're going to want the Shotgunner cards obviously... And Skeet Shooter and Enforcer. Your SPECIAL spread is in a good place for Shotguns already. That particular shotgun isn't magic (you can look that up if you want too), but it doesn't matter because it will likely be a one shot weapon once you're in Nerd Rage territory anyway. Shotguns are also really great in VATS (again, even the non magic ones), so you might want to look at luck perks that play into that .
---
How NOW brown COW??
---
I'll take that over the headaches any day.
---
I was actually using a Tesla when I entered the grove. Intresting
---
Yes
---
We gain nothing from personally attacking the employees. These people are simply following the model implemented by the company. The state of the game solely lands on the feet of Bethesda Studio's management. I hardly believe "Joe Smoe", who worked on the wall fix, came in one day and said "Fuck, I really need to work on a wall fix this patch." And even if he did, it's still lands on management for allowing him to so while there are way more pressing things to attend to in the game.
---
amazing post, don't know if real but gave me a good chuckle
---
Radiation rumble is probably the best actually. That event can be nuts!
---
It's not *this* bad on PC, but lag for me is noticeably worse. Especially in whitesprings
---
happen after leaving NW
---
I like to think it's the game making absolutely sure that you really want to sell that stuff.
---
I dont care what you think,it is the truth,my experience with this game is a very bad one,there is absolutely no punishment for cheaters,even the recent "ban wave" was a joke,and even the 1% that got banned got their accounts back with a slap in the wrist,i just take the time to write here for people to know what to expect from this game.
---
&gt;company store
---
Atomic Shop.
---
This is the post I've been wanting to see for ages. People seem to be complaining for the sake of complaining.
---
Omg this. It's so annoying
---
Use all:
---
5.56 ammo
---
5mm ammo
---
.44 ammo
---
10mm ammo
---
4mm grenade ammo

&gt; Convert to 3509 points? Y/N

Can we please have an interface like this again?
---
Nukashine
---
Wow new player here and can't even progress cause of this damn bug...Jesus
---
Does the monthly renew itself?
---
Looks great. Is this a build after patch 21?
---
I have my garden 'in a basement'. Basically floors got removed and half wall placed under full wall. I managed, by chance to get the floor at just the right height to do this. Now that isn't going to happen. So unimpressed.
---
No problem :)
---
They were rewards for playing in Survival Mode back when that existed. Nobody knows if they'll come back, but you can equal or better weapons out in the wild.
---
Here's a trick someone told me and since ive done it nothing has left my vendors. All you have to do is blueprint your shops and they won't get stored back onto your stash hope that helps!
---
I've been in that sub for a bit. Some of the stuff you see is hilarious
---
I do feel like shotguns have been broken, but I haven't run into anything consistently. I assumed it was just bad luck since it still works sometimes.
---
Start a new character and try a new build or something weird .. (gave my level 2 15 mutations )
---
I'm having lingering flashbacks to the Vault-Tec Rep...
---
The best part for me was the fake smile of "I'm paid to like this game". There where a few times her body language spoke volumes about how "great" this game is.
---
And the developers, when they were answering her questions...such enthusiasm. Such creativity. No, really. Amazing.....crash
---
Is it consistent or change from time to time? My weapons’ numbers vary a lot for no reason, I haven’t figured out what’s affecting it.
---
Awww I really want you to build this for me😂😂that looks amazing
---
Yes, it defaults to renew every month. I don't know how it works on XBox but after you buy it the first thing you'll want to do is turn off auto renew. I know I PS4 it falls under Services and not Subscriptions, so I'm assuming it's similar on Xbox.
---
Il stop complaining when theres nothing to complain about. 
---
Bunch of marcy longs
---
Well keep in mind unless you have the right perks and legendary effects on it, you won’t do much damage to the queen. 
---
For example (I’m not a heavy guns build) let’s say with all the right heavy gun perks, blood mess, nerd rage etc.  Your Gatling plasma normally does 100 damage on your pip boy. It doesn’t mean it will do 100 damage to the queen. Since she has a HUGE amount of damage resistance. I remember using my furious Gatling laser on her and each bullet only did about 1 damage to her, if I shot her face I saw the numbers go up to 2-3 but that’s as far as it went. 
---
Maybe your Gatling plasma simply didn’t do enough damage for her. Sorry if it isn’t helpful or the answer you wanted.
---
Now, and forever.
---
sometimes can find some in wendigo cave in my experience
---
Old news, but thanks
---
I have succulent beautiful internet speed, and the lag for me since the last update has been abysmal.
---
You are not alone.
---
I have ultra45 Fixer for SBQ only. But tbh after shooting the rest of my 4-5k ultra45 i’d go to regular ones. Ultra45 are Nice, but useless imho
---
The radial damage is broken most of the time on enemies, though it seems to work perfectly on players. The acid damage from weapons, however, tends to be minuscule on most everything and unnoticeable.
---
You mean like how even though people of different income levels pay different amounts of taxes, but they all still drive on the same public roads?
---
if I could i would give 100kk upvotes to ur topic. i am still here (in this sub) to lmao of their crazy ideas while playing the game. But i am done to create post bcz i was already targeted by moders for reposting the same thought (imagine how many repeatable post about just everything we see every day). So i am here until i get banned or something.
---
Very well said! That would be the best way to do that, upvoted
---
That's nothing, last time I fought the queen I got a nocturnal rolling pin. After midnight it's about to get real.
---
yeah, why is it so hard for Bethesda to understand why it would be better if in the converter we could just click a "convert ALL of &lt;ammo type&gt;" instead of specific amounts...
---
From what I've seen, it's fairly consistent. Maybe 10-20point variance, but that could be wrote off with "roll of the dice".
---
They are only really meant for low tier items for low lvl players and if u could trade in lots it would be ruined by the dupers
---
I used those requisitions for that first mission that basically teaches you how to use it. And maybe two more times after that. Then I realized how worthless they are and time consuming so I just don’t bother picking them up anymore.
---
With all due respect, it boggles my mind that almost 2 years after release some people still don't understand that this is an online game. This isn't FNV, you're not going to kill the legendary deathclaw or go through a tough dungeon and get the best gun in the game for it. This game is RNG grind, and that's **ALL** it is. There is no real end-game. It's designed and balanced around doing the same thing mindlessly for hundreds of hours, like minecraft or warframe. People trying to skip the grind by duping or asking for shit like this can't see that there is nothing left once they skip it
---
Good chance the 1043 was doing all of it.
---
tried the mine myself again tonight, and yup it worked, I assume whatever was broken has been fixed
---
Imho one of the most underrated weapons in FO76
---
Nice 👍. My weapons vary a lot, sometimes 10x difference, I have no idea why.
---
It's more of the meat piles that cause a fps drop. Happens at line in the sand, just enter defiance and come back out, fixes the fps drop
---
Yay, variable framerate! We've definitely arrived in 2020! 😆
---
Now they just have to fix basically everything else in the engine that's still stuck in 2010 (or prior).
---
Seems to be working again now (at least for me and a few others) give it another try
---
We had a dog named Suzy. She used to bring home all kinds of stuff after her adventures. Jeans, a bag of groceries, half of a goat...you never knew what could happen. She was a pretty amazing dog.
---
It's not the apocalypse, it's the *post*-apocalypse.
---
Rebuilding is like, a constant theme for so many factions in fallout lore, and the primary point of vault 76 itself
---
r/notopbutok
---
Well... That's the trick: your HP is low, but you take less damage. Perks like Dodgy, mutations like adrenal... You have less HP but you need less HP because it is harder to hit you and harder to hurt you. Also, battles last 1/6 what they used to last: less exposure to danger. 
---
Unyielding is easy mode for me. I have 5 different builds and the bloodied Unyielding usually does because of a distraction, like a high fall or fast-traveling to a highly radiated spot.
---
The only possible explanation I have is, you’re a bloodied/unyielding character. When you die, your health slightly regenerates (takes away some rads) so you no longer have that extra carry weight bonus. 
---
You might be overencumbered which glitches the game into only letting you spawn at vault 76.  
---
At least that’s what kept happening to me. 
---
If I die out in the open or during an event, as long as I’m not over encumbered I spawn right away. 
---
But if I was carrying too much, either it doesn’t let me spawn, or I have no choice but to go to vault 76.
---
I love this game, and the community is the best part 99% of the time, and i think there is plenty to do but sadly I've over-played it and there isnt much left for me to do
---
It's working for me.
---
LOL, no they haven't
---
Save the Sole Survivor.  *Minuteman Gun Salute*
---
I did a reinstall yesterday and my performance definitely benefitted. Only draw back was losing my photos.
---
The only possible explanation I have is that you join the events way too late. Like by the time you travel there, the timer ran out. Which means event failed. 
---
But if you’re fast traveling right away as soon as the event pops up, and it still fails, then you might want to submit a ticket.
---
I'm also on Xbox on Xfinity and have no lag or issues at all.  Are you wired or wireless?  Are you playing during "peak hours" in your neighborhood for others to be online?  Xfinity (and all cable internet I think) is a shared media / bandwidth service.  Basically you have a "private line" from your cable modem to the main trunk on the street.  At that point however you aggregate with everyone else in your neighborhood.  If you're the first / only person on the line you have pretty much the entire spread of bandwidth, but if / when everyone else gets online it can cause latency (especially with everyone working from home and having nothing to do other than game / stream all day).  This problem is exacerbated by being connected to WiFi rather than a hard Ethernet connection.  WiFi frequency bands are (at least around me) just utterly slammed right now with everyone sitting around in their houses and this creates a huge amount of noise in the signal.  If you can, try a hard Ethernet connection.
---
Testing your network connection
---
On a PC (or other device) on your network and preferably over a hard Ethernet connection, try testing your connection using tools like the ones found at dslreports.com.  Specifically try the ping test http://www.dslreports.com/pingtest which measures line quality and loss. A speed test, while helpful, is not the only measurement.  High speed != high quality.
---
Try rebooting your Xbox One.  Try using the "Full-Shutdown" option to reboot you Xbox One.  The instant-on option (which I think is the default) is more akin to putting a PC in sleep or hibernation.  In instant-on mode it's still kind-of on.  A full-shutdown / restart can oftentimes clear up issues.
---
The plans for the Fixer are a reward from the event Encryptid. Not 100 percent guaranteed, but they drop. Learn the plan and then you can craft common ones and receive legendary ones.
---
I guess but I don't roll play... All I was saying is there is very little negative to using a junky gun with a HUGE increase in damage.
---
yeah I keep trying games but nothing interests me, the only genre I like it survival and fallout is the only game that is up my alley with all that and this new game grounded is out and people keep recommending it but it just isn't for me, I dont like cartoon-y games but there id nothing out there like fallout that I can find
---
If it was the meat piles I feel like I would’ve had it happen earlier. I run events for a couple of hours a day, including bugged line in the sand events every now and then. At the end of that particular event there are probably 100-150 meat piles in one concentrated spot around the sonic machine. But there’s no lag for me even at such an extreme.
---
That's all this is. Every update we get a "boycott bethesda, cancel your 1st subs, fuck the devs, this needs to change" wave. At this point, "beta/launch player here, I stood through everything but this is the final straw and I'm leaving" is a meme because there have been so many melodramatic whiny posts like that after each update. The only people whose words we should take seriously are the ones who actually did what they said, and they're not here to talk about it so it kind of defeats the purpose. The rest are going to come straight back in a week or two if they ever leave/cancel to begin with
---
Amen
---
a couple of games actually, but there's no other games out right now that catch my interest, fallout is the only game I want to play, has been like that since it came out but the second I hear the main menu music and I see the play button I can't bring myself to start it up, i close the app and just look through the store and i don't know what game to play and then I just go do something else
---
It is weird, mine does work sometimes but not nearly as often as it used to. It says 30%, but I'm consistently below that so idk
---
Yes totally, but I love nuka shine and would like to have nuka shine t65. I understand skin for particular PA like excavator and stangler,which are a different type and purpose, but t series is just a matter of looks and tastes so why having separate skins?
---
I had this bug a few weeks ago, find somewhere close to respawn but not where you died.
---
It happened to all my characters for one day then disappeared
---
I stopped playing because I didn't want to deal with disconnects, Buggy game play, and the absolutely hellacious grinding for shit rewards. I never launched a nuke, never got my build right, and now my step-dad (who has a SHIT TON of hours) just uses me to transfer his items from one character to another on Xbox. No big deal. I'm playing no man's sky and will forever play rocket league
---
Yeah, I can't do cartoon-y games either....which probably means I may as well not even start No Man's Sky.  It just looks stupid.
---
That's odd both rad rumble and line in the sand had issues for my group of 10 people last night, wonder if it's a server side issue, cause some light sources would put off a pixilated light
---
I know!  It would be so much fun to be able to do that.
---
Way to generalize thousands of posts, and hundreds of thousands of users. Have you tried spending time in /r/fo76FilthyCasuals yet?
---
Thx! I just went there and found 3
---
I've noticed a lot of them are set to 10mm. I'm thinking it either defaults there or there's a secondary glitch involving 10mm. Or maybe it just makes it fast and they're converting it to something more useful?
---
Lol... that’s not why they removed it. Go read what they said about it
---
Sorry it too me so long to reply that’s the one that has a broken spine the one I’m talking about doesnt
---
Lol.  Probably.  But we may have to trigger the storm to be rid of the BOS.  I'd rather walk around in power armor all day than have the BOS take my plasma gatlimg gun as long as I can nuke ZAX's.
---
Sick ur welcome.e
---
I never even looked at it because of how absolutely shit the reviews were
---
Would you explain a little to me what the magic thing is?  I've seen it before, and tried to research it, but every time it just seems to produce search results related to legendary modifiers.  If not could you point me to a source that I can do the rest of the research on my own?
---
Its strange, as the newest content you would think they'd be all over that. I'm actually surprised there isn't some really good skins and paints only for the 65 at this point.
---
My bloodied Archer is doing great damage, finally oneshooting most enemies at events. You can push it up to 2000-3000 with the right distance/combo. 
---
But 1000 a shot means killing. Congrats.
---
Now, don't try bloodied unarmed. The first time my ninja punched a mutant in the face for 15000... It's hard to go back to normal, human damage.
---
I’ve had weird stability issues since the patch. Two days ago, I crashed a couple times, so I  rebooted my computer. Still crashing a ton so I just shut down for the day. Start up yesterday, smooth sailing. Dunno what’s going on.
---
Congrats! You’re now Joshua graham
---
It has nothing to do with Teslas.  We did multiple events on a private server with no one using any energy weapons and we got the insane FPS drops and lag spikes.
---
It has to do with dead enemies in general whether it be meat piles or ash piles or goo piles.  Even when you pick up the meat piles and every one of them is gone the effect still persists.    
---
We did this specifically to test whether or not it was energy weapons causing the issue.  They aren't.
---
I had this glitch when I was using the excavator PA, but now when I respawn I still have enough health for unyielding set to give me enough strength to carry all stuff in my inventory tho. And I have all other locations available for fast travel. Also this happens only in events.
---
Yeah I mean it’s hard to say what’s causing it without any knowledge of game engines, but anecdotally my gameplay has been fine till someone fired a Tesla rifle on screen. I did have the same symptom you’ve just mentioned however, a black pixelated effect on my character model when I looked at certain parts of the room I was in.
---
How does the vendor bot trade window style slider not work for this? 
---
Who thinks these things are "okay" and "ready for launch" or "really even worth a damn"?
---
Did they leave the dog that played Dogmeat in charge? River was it? Good girl. Who made video game? Yes you did. Yes you did. Go catch the ball... since you dropped it.
---
sadly since its directly from Beth they can do the discount but with other services i.e PS / Xbox they want their cut of the money so both parties have to agree to a discount :/ kinda shitty i know
---
That's insanely cool.
---
Happens to me when I choose to stay on a world in which my camp cannot be placed.
---
Search r/ fo76 frame rates. All the proof I need.
---
&gt;That's why I keep playing and you don't get to declare the reasons people should play or not.
---
He didn't. He highlighted an obvious and strangely common trait of this sub reddit. He also has a valid point, that being the arguably worthless, overly dramatic comments and posts from those that continue to log in and continue to "grind" regardless.
---
Supposedly it got better.
---
Yeah, the pixelated light was a first for me last night, I've read a lot of issues about meat piles the past few days. It is hard to say with this game rofl
---
&gt; I'm pretty positive that it was chosen as the clunky terminal specifically to slow us down on ammo conversions in order to retain value for things like actually crafting ammo, and going out finding ammo.
---
The converter has no value though, the amount you have to put in for the amount you get is completely at odds with eachother.  Honestly the whole thing feels like going to Gamestop to trade in 40 games to cover the cost of 1 preowned game they're selling
---
Not even close to ready for beta test.
---
At the minimum it should give you the option to sell all ammo of a certain type in your inventory instead of selling it in increments.
---
This is ignoring them poaching any and all doctors and engineers from the Responders they could get their hands on
---
Those are lower level though.
---
If you have your thing set to area chat, when you speak you should see your name pop up at the bottom left in white letters along with the “area chat”   That means your voice is being played for other people. 
---
As long as the other players near you have area chat on as well, they should be able to hear you, and assuming their microphone is turned on, you should be able to hear them as well. 
---
Keep in mind some people are on a team so they might have their audio settings to “team only” in case they don’t want to hear or talk to other people except their team. 
---
So let’s say you look at the bottom left and see one of the following
---
Player123- area chat
---
Player123-team chat 
---
If you see an X next to that, it means you can’t hear them because they are on a different setting than you. 
---
Also (on the ps4) you can make private party chats so you can only hear and talk to the people on your chat party, instead of talking in the videogame.
---
&gt;BOTH GAMES REDDIT COMMUNITY HAVE STRONG OFTEN NEGATIVE OPINIONS
---
it is always like that. Any game I played. It looks like players with positive opinions dont have so much to say. Could be "thank u" or make a question. As for Morrowind it was one of the hugest game in the history speaking of custom mods, patches and additional content. And one of the hugest fanbase created before reddit. So I was kinda offended how u didnt digress with Morrowind. We still play this game after 18 years :)
---
It doesn't require a "fix" considering it isn't an actual feature. It is a work-around, and not endorsed or intended in any way. You only have yourself to blame if you lose items doing this, unfortunately. That being said, I completely agree that a account-wide stash is needed.
---
Atom shop freebies are gone today or tomorrow I think.
---
I am bloodied and take pylons for you, crybaby. The event fails because of many factors. 
---
I have seen tons of tough-guys power armor Chads running around causing no damage, taking no pylons and wasting someone's recall card. 
---
I only fail when the game goes crazy and the imposter goes godmode, invincible because of a bug. And that rarely happens.
---
Go ahead and shut mine down.
---
I've got 800 or 900 sitting around just in case they become useful one day. I don't expect guaranteed legendaries, but even just being able to mass use X of them to get a larger amount of loot would be fine. I believe they are capable of dropping colored bats, so I wouldn't mind rolling all of my requisitions, I'm just not going to run back and forth from the terminal to drop site hundreds of times for it
---
It’s a UX nightmare all the way around, but getting out is the worst. I swear to god, I have the same trouble as you just trying to leave the damn thing once I’ve finished my button mashing episode.
---
\*\*\[Edit of Edits\]\*\*
---
Just read your other comments that other games are running fine.  Try rebooting the Xbox One.  It could be a cache issue.
---
Fireproof is working now.  Just tested, did 0 damage to myself with bloodied gauss.
---
The discounts are available on Xbox.
---
Riding shotgun is probably the easiest event with a guaranteed legendary spawn. Best part is that the event is player initiated so you don’t have to wait for the event to spawn randomly. If by chance someone ran the event within the last hour just jump servers.
---
https://youtu.be/AHu4CErJXU4
---
Here you go. And yeah, it comes down to certain modifiers making them over perform in VATS.
---
I can answer that last question... Profitability.
---
Lets hope they buff other builds instead of nerfing Bloodied into the ground
---
Are you crazy? You can’t do that or else the whole server would crash. This way is much much better way of keeping players spending time in the game.
---
Yes. Just finished it late last night.
---
There’s no guaranteed place that you’ll go and every time there will be a legendary. 
---
There are locations where they usually have a high chance of spawning. Which is high level enemies in high level areas. It doesn’t mean when you go there they will be there waiting for you. Sometimes you have to clear the entire area, and if it didn’t spawn, simply join a new server so they spawn again. 
---
West Tek is my go to place. I’ve gotten lucky and had 3 legendary mutants spawn in there. Other times I only had 1. 
---
I had to server hop maybe twice, or even up to 6 times.
---
damn, wonder if it sony holding out or just a delay on their end
---
if it's for daily/weekly challenge level doesnt matter, and there are 3 legendary spawns in uranium fever.
---
Market is what the market is.    The drop rate is bad.    Not the worst by far but bad.   Most PC prices have been between 6-10k.   
---
Best bet is to keep looking and run the event when ever it pops up.
---
Oh boy, I cant wait to replace her only to get something like this repeated to me for eternity instead.

---
Very nice. Thanks for the info and keep going with awesome builds like this!
---
What are you babbling about? I was relying to a comment about someone hating on Bloodied builds, I simply pointed out not all Bloodied players are awful. Nothing to do with PvP or Gamma guns, smh...
---
I know it works with gauss weapons
---
I'm on steam. Tried the 2 forst solutions allready, didn't work.
---
Trying the downclocks, let's see.
---
I know.  Wish op had specified.
---
I usually see them go between 8k and 10k on Xbox. Idk about the differences in prices between Xbox and PC normally
---
N.b. "hope you sleep well at night"
---
Yes it really happened! I don’t think the ammo factories were connected to the other things because the workshop was unowned
---
Prices on PC are different than consoles because duping and exploiting are more prevalent in the former. Fixer plans are hard to get in normal circumstances so they tend to be more expensive. The cheapest ones I've seen on PS4 are about 10k
---
Hey man. Take a break from the game. Don’t worry, if you come back, FO76 will still be here, and hell it might even be better! But what I read here was something that well.. you basically described what I would call burn out. Just take a break, or quit! Whatever you do, don’t come back right now. Don’t force yourself to do something you don’t enjoy, that’s just crazy.
---
Ooh thanks for this!
---
[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hgg530/ammo_convert_spreadsheet_dynamic_tables/) might be useful to people, too.
---
Oh, you innocent thing, this is just a regular day in this game. I would be willing to bet the level 1000 was responsible for a large part of it. After using the god mode exploit and the glassed cavern exploit for exp to reach rank 100 of the season two weeks ago, he got bored of doing anything else and is now coming on just to farm. So he takes over a workshop, builds a bunch of ammo machines he blueprinted with another exploit, and sets that going while he photomode clips through silo doors to launch a nuke within a few minutes. Then he pulls out his duped bloodied fire rate fixer and makes sure to use his demigod bloodied/unyielding build to quickly tear the queen's health down while his buddies with bugged miniguns/LMGs act as backup to make sure it happens in record speed. You were merely a bystander to this momentous event
---
possibly just a effect of supply vs demand, more available on pc
---
Alternative for the flamer fuel:
---
Go to the sacrament up by that camp for the photo daily quest, and repeatedly kill the head cultist via server hopping. They drop 50 to 100 fuel each time they die. I know flamers chew through ammo like no tomorrow, but hopefully this helps.
---
Of course it is. Did any of them actually play the game themselves to test it out or was it too unenjoyable to them? Cause I feel like if any of them did and used their camp at all, they would have realized this.
---
Hell, there had to be a person that knowingly let the code to repeat the same line every minute. Even if they didnt all notice through their own gameplay, this was a concious choice to be included by someone.
---
I got mine for 6k and my friend for 7k, both on pc
---
Burrows sucks tbh.
---
This is a great idea and I love you.💕
---
It'd be a great way to introduce a repeatable quest too, like Nukashines Biv. 
---
Imagine you meet an npc that gives you a small quest to gather plants and some fertilizer or something. It doesn't have to be complicated, just some kind of daily quest. Maybe you have to kill some animal that's destroying their crops. And your reward are the "seeds" (camp plan) to one of the crops in game.
---
It wasn't broken, it's not intended as a serious challenge. But people complain about it enough that they probably changed it just to shut them up. The actually broken challenges like killing the SBQ or exploring certain areas are untouched
---
You can buy either one side or the other, or both for slightly lower price
---
Riiiiiight... A Twitch issue. . .
---
And ... AND ... let us have it voxed so it talks!
---
The only way you can get it is through nukes though.  Do something to do that thing better?  Doesn't seem worth it.
---
 I can’t speak for others but I keep playing to kill time. I’ve played all I wanted to on Xbox so until the next gen of consoles come out and we get a ps5 I have nothing else to play.
---
Stumbled upon my plan for 1000 caps on PS4. Should’ve bought a lottery ticket that day.
---
at this point with fo76 i'm kinda not shocked xD i mean i  have watch someone walk on clouds in NW so i should think anything is possible
---
I think i was on that server for ps4, we killed that queen within 10 seconds and launched the nuke oddly, was ridiculous
---
I was born ready Wang!
---
I think giving them the best melee weapon they can handle at their level is better than ammo.....   ammo is just an absolute hassle at low levels.
---
One of my law proffesors used to say "Even the baby has to cry for the mother to give milk",he used to say that to remind us that we have to make demands if we want change,if people were not nagging we would still have a 400 pound stash and people would still use melee because ranged weapons used to make the mob health rubberband making them invulnerable.people should demand,its a paying game and as customers they have the right to do so.
---
I’m genuinely disappointed in myself for not thinking of this........
---
It's kind of sad that we've been missing things like account stashes, double sided walls, a real trading system, etc for so long that exploits or workarounds have been accepted as the intended systems
---
Good advice, thanks. I was considering this, I just got so distracted by the main quest and doing the daily grind to get the cap limit from the vendors and collect plans/craft upgraded weapons and gear. During times like these, I actually enjoy a grindy game to keep me busy and to make for a game that I  end up being able to get a lot of gameplay from.
---
Why is 95% of these kind of suggestions always end in a guaranteed legendary. Usually a 3 star one at that.
---
Legendaries are so common there doesn’t need to be more ways to get more.
---
I actually like Wanderer the most, despite some of the reptition, she's the least annoying to me. One of my camps has a sort of music garden, so I put her guitar in amongst the rest of the instruments, so she will swap between the instruments which cuts down a little bit on some of the repition.
---
The downside is you get lots of tuba. 
---
Plus, not sure how it happens, but you also get tuba and humming simultaneously with the addtion of one of her phrases, she's a one-gal band, she doesn't need to join one.
---
Isn't there a realatively small, circular border for where you can create buildings and craftable objects?
---
Look at the picture again. It doesn’t have a broken spine.
---
No this was Xbox
---
Sniper here✊
---
odd, the exact same thing happened to me on ps4
---
The lag in the stream was bad and it just fell flat. Especially considering the collosal problem was supposed to come out with update 21.
---
The first few days were much smoother than before for me, 90-100 fps consistently even at high settings with 100 fov. Now I get severe drops around bodies, down to 40 or below
---
It happened after the patch, because I had it on a wall with wallpaper applied before hand and when I logged in after the patch I had to remove it to even move the board.
---
Yes please.  We already have another poop factory, no need for another.
---
While we are on the subject, why isn't there a function to drop all scrap in your inventory? If you're not a Fallout first member and you need to drop your excess scrap it takes ages. There should be a drop all scrap button, but I'm sure the reason is to try to get people to buy first. I had first for a while but never again. Bethesda isn't getting another cent until the game they run is more fixed than broken and I don't see that happening for another year or two. It's a shame, what wasted potential. 😔
---
They hate this game so much they play it every fucking day. Despite having a Steam Library full of unplayed games
---
Ha, just can't escape her. I once began sprinting away to try to make it away in time, yet I could hear her dialogue start and continue even after I got (what I thought would be) out of earshot.
---
Just put a hole in your floor and sink a purifier into it.
---
Commando.
---
...do you even know who I am? xD
---
Honestly, if you're starting from scratch, I'd buy the game now while it's on sale but I'd only start playing a week before Colossal Problem comes out. 
---
At this point you can't get the legendary run finished casually from start, but you can easily get the ammo converter at level 5. And if you give yourself a week, you can level up a good amount to participate in the new boss event. The game is kind of in a shitty state after patch 20, with some quests being broken and meatpiles causing lag
---
Yeah.. but so many limitations have been put in place to prevent the runoff damage from dupers and exploiters, and look how they handled it when it came time to hand out bans 🤷‍♂️  
---
*Why* place limitations meant to hinder dupers and exploiters if you don't intend to take action against them? So many of their arguments against all stash/weight/currency limits imploded the moment they revoked the bans. Like why remove double sided walls to prevent a specific exploit when they have no intention of policing said exploit? 😔
---
Sweet momma, that is one hell of a ride
---
We complain because we want the game to be improved.   
---
Always remember: When the complaining stops, the game is dead.
---
This happened with me on pc on both radiation rumble and line in the sand
---
I would rather not reward the people that cheated/paid there way to the end. No one who plays normally is done yet.
---
The timer might have run out.
---
How about we stop trying to reinvent a perfectly good wheel.
---
And no, the ammo converter as it stands is not a good wheel. 
---
Anyone remember how it worked in New Vegas? Yeh. That was nice and made sense. 
---
The only change I'd do to that system is the ability to melt down the case into brass scrap to forge other cases from.
---
Beyond that, all ammo (ballistic) was crafted with either a pistol or rifle primer, a case, some amount of powder, and a specific bullet (which you made from lead scrap).
---
Hell they even had the ability to make special ammo like AP(better armor penetration) or HP (bad at armor penetration but great on soft targets like ghouls).
---
But maybe I'm nostalgic.
---
hopefully when they give us legendary perks we will see different styles but probably not as good as whatever the current meta at the time will do
---
It can get a bit crowded up there with Queen bodies laying around.  Makes it hard to keep track of the edge sometimes, lol!  Lots of fun, though.
---
Honestly if they'd keep their word and just quit, they could drop this sub and we could stop seeing their posts entirely.
---
As others told you, the flames don't even heal with friendly fire, only bashing. But the two shot is pretty garbage in general, I would suggest keeping the medic's. Two shot only gives you a damage bonus for the base damage, and the majority of the flamer's damage comes from upgrading the nozzle. Base damage is 36, using the attachments brings it up to double or triple that. Yet two shot will only give you 9 additional points of damage per hit, and that's after splitting your shots in two
---
Those three are only so popular because their most effective against the SBQ. Every other build (except grenades) are perfectly fine and powerful enough for day to day stuff that isn't Scorched Earth. As for grenades, I agree they need love, but I don't think a damage buff will help... They suck because it's impossible to actually hit most things with them... Now of they implemented some sort of crafting method where you could make them "sticky", wherein they would attach themselves to a target in someway than they might be viable.
---
Yep, live and learn haha.
---
 grenadiers  Nuke grenades from hidden is very powerful same with plasma, not saying expo in general couldn't use some love like the AGL and missile launcher.   
---
Sniper is viable as it should be slow to fire and hitting crits every time.   
---
But really who needs the most love overall is gunslinger (so long as magic is around for shotguns) unless you have a TSE ultracite laser pistol with beam splitter muzzle poppin out that magic damage at full card+ but alas as far as I know there are only 2 TSE ultrasite pistols and 1 BE ultrasite laser pistol.   
---
Also I think they never fully implemented chainsaw since the ripper is a thing. But yeah a flaming double bar or bow bloodied swing speed chain saw would be epic. would break in like 15 seconds against the queen but epic anyways
---
That's not magic, that's hacked, or many many magic weapons.
---
I should of mentioned that it’s all the time, some are as soon as they’ve started others are like 5-10 mins after they’ve started
---
Huh, must be a similar exploit
---
I'm going to say no. Bloodied builds are ridiculously OP and broken. Those that play that build counter with the argument that they are a glass cannon and can die very easily. Dying has almost no drawbacks in the game as is and you're wanting to remove what is, effectively, the only one?
---
Fallout 76 Special Edition
---
I don't understand why they can't / won't evaluate limits/caps on stuff as is.  The overall community has some great ideas (and lessons learned today, the one above is clearly a bad one) that it surprises me it doesn't get addressed.  I have to wonder if they really make that much money as it currently functions that they just don't care to address the things folks on here point out.
---
Seen that a few times. First time i saw it, had an underground camp accessed by backing out of a terminal that lead downstairs to craft/stash  SBQ didnt always hit the mark
---
but yea those SBZ LZ's are fun
---
Personally idc where we fight her as long as the people have the firepower to take her down at least in 20 mins
---
Ive had fights where we killed her in the Air, landing maybe once.
---
Gotcha, thanks👍
---
Happened to me as well twice on Xbox in the past week. 
---
Only reason I noticed was my vendor icon changed to a normal camp one. Cut to me trying to figure out why my vendors were not powered up only to finally check to see what was listed for sale. Nothing.
---
Easiest way is to join a events team and just keep hammering away at them
---
No limit if you've got 1st (and that's what they want).
---
I’ll be more than happy to help when I wake up a good bit. I’ll dm you if that’s alright
---
&gt;The actually broken challenges like killing the SBQ or exploring certain areas are untouched
---
And this here is the more burning issue, as I'm sure a lot more people run into at least one (but more probably several) of those... Ah well.
---
^(That said, I'm actually scared they'll hotfix this and claim it was just a typo.)
---
Uh sure thanks!
---
You can stuck it but it's capped at 90%
---
Figures Beth would implement a system this broken. I had already figured this out by doing tests in my own personal ammo factory but it's good to know the actual math. At first I was making 10mm cause that was the fastest and I could turn about 20k 10mm into 4k flamer fuel, but then I noticed 5.56 gives you more points for less and switched to them. Basically I never need to make ammo again. 😁👍
---
Two things to keep in mind:
---
1) The weight reduction only applies to the base weapon. Mods are not reduced.
---
2) While you can stack 5 pieces of armor the reduction caps at 90%.
---
I saw one for 2k once on ps4
---
Stash stays at 800lb; you’ll get a bottomless scrapbox for your junk which will free up a couple hundred pounds of stash space. Just wanted to clarify.
---
People whose camps can't be entered unless you pass through the decon shower need to be nuked. /s
---
(But seriously. Let bloodied builds live.)
---
its both default and fast
---
? How is it no limit if you have 1st?
---
Thanks for the information , really useful :)
---
I've been crashing a lot more on PC these last two days. Plus the whole loading into the world with a black screen situation. Frustrating at the very least.
---
Stash box let's you store unlimited scrap.
---
They vary cuz of the last batch of doopes.  I've seen them in players vending machines between 100-10k
---
Bottomless scrap box
---
Dude I’ve got a camp in this same spot! Not as good as yours though. It’s a Slocum’s Joe themed one. 
---
I know what you went through because lining up the initial stair to place down was torturous...
---
I don’t have first because I literally do not want unlimited stash
---
Yeah tesla coils dose very little damage. Same with the aoe effect from the strangler heart. I have mine in just to help tag enemy's. But it's not any good at killing then
---
I can appreciate the sentiment of keeping the free track (and my down doots clearly show your in the vast majority) and / or provided an expansion ie. Destiny/Fortnite/Rocket League/Others of past the cap level would be a nice feature in the future.
---
I only suggested a premium track on the basis that it could actually be a value for the money spent.  If it double your rewards or 1.5X'ed them with some unique added bonuses, that more value than spending those at the atom shop or on a month of FO1st.  I'm perfectly fine with it as is, I expect to be done with the board probably next week and then I probably won't play consistently for a while because I'm just grinding gold to finish off the mods for the power armor and that's not enough of a carrot to push on right now.
---
Oh please let me have a dog!
---
Wow! Thanks for sharing, this an incredible guide.  BUT, I won’t be farming for the Brotherhood. Farming for myself and my vending machines though...
---
I just do it to give them a friendly wasteland welcome...
---
wouldn't say it is removing anything at all, its just making it so all your choices have a downside or a reaction. i mean i think giving someone the chance to fight it out seem appealing but i feel like people really hate pvp in general or just anything that isn't of their own view on the subject. meh it was a suggestion to something i found to lack any real action, i mean if you lock pick someone base it gives a reaction so i figured why not also your corpse.
---
They are just bad
---
Really? Like recently? Seems like there more investigating I need to do on this
---
why are you doing 12 rounds at a time??
---
This game has turned into a rainy day game for me at this point
---
They have a built in explosive effect.
---
Yes. That motherfucker needs to die.
---
Yeah I know, but does grenadier make the radius of explosive damage larger for you?
---
You need to fully loot supply drops and scorchbeasts to prevent this bug
---
Yes.
---
At L20, I stumbled across a Vampire Machete.  When that became underpowered, so to speak, I picked up a L35 Death Tambo, then a L45 cultist dagger.
---
At L65, I found a vampire switchblade.  At L227 now, that switchblade is still my goto.  For places like whitesprings, it is supplemented by a FSS ghoul slayers switchblade.  
---
Either one has enough umph to take out a SB when it lands in front of me.
---
Hunters combat knife for most higher level animals.  
---
I like the various gauntlets, but when I am in the higher level areas, I’m usually in PA, so can’t equip them.
---
I generally use a heavy weapon for things that fly and/or don’t land very often.
---
Your comment is spot on.  The way the legendary run is setup is that it requires daily interaction.  Even fortnite and other games give some opportunity to catch up mid season.
---
It's still shit but better than before tbh.
---
Sorry for such a late response, but beam splitter with two shot makes it shoot 4 shots at a time, that look like little plasma balls, but it acts like a flame sprayer damage wise. It struggles to kill level 5 ghouls, and it has no range. The stats lie about how much range it thinks it has, probably due to beam splitter being bugged, and combined with two shot makes the accuracy disappear
---
They still need to collect that scrap like everyone else.
---
Just like Far Harbor!
---
Yes.... so they still need to collect the scrap just like everyone else
---
Thanks
---
Max level back pack? There's levels to it? But yeah regardless because of all the carry weight I get from radicool I was thinking about getting the fridge backpack for a good while now. It's a shame what I came up with wasn't entirely original though considering how cool of a combo it is. 
---
Infact I didn't know you could stack mutations until yesterday, I've been doing bloodied without adrenal gland for a good month now, just marsupial. But now I'm gonna see how funky I can get with most intricate load out possible.
---
??
---
For 49 steel you get 35 railroad spikes with max ammosmith. Those 35 spikes yield 116 ammo points at 10 points per 3 spikes. That 116 points is not enough to do the conversion to .50 since you need 350 points to buy 100 rounds. On a point per round basis, 49 steal yields you 33 rounds of .50 ammo.
---
Personal ammo factory? I'm super confused lol. Do you mean the ArmCo ammunition constructor?
---
Go into settings and turn on the damage view and it will show you what you are actually hitting at rather than what the pip shows. On SBQ you can see the drastic fall off of damage due to resistance. What you think you are getting is no where close. That's why many people use the multi shot weapons to make sure they hit the damage threshold of 1000. Gatlings, miniguns, plasma etc. When you pump that much ammo into her at 1-5 damage per hit you can guarantee you put at least 1000 damage on her.
---
Not a bug. It’s a legendary effect.
---
Die, and you should drop it all right? Or maybe certain stuff stays in your inventory
---
This is pretty much how I assumed they were going to fix it. I preferred how it was before, to how it is now, personally. I usually just drop all my unneeded ammo at my camp and vault 76 still because the ammo converter is annoying to use now.
---
Every person is different. That’s how capitalism works
---
I can only assume they want it to be difficult.  Not sure why.
---
I never post abt complaining but when playing the game i do complain but that doesnt matter i will always love the game and i think that once this virus stuff is over and bethesda can fully work again they can fix more bugs.
---
Just blueprint the Ammo factory machine from the workshop and place it at your camp, high quality 2020 gaming.
---
Do these glitch the workshop budget like the camp budget, I wonder?
---
Yes it's persistent after a restart. Yes it happens with power armor as well. This is on PS4.
---
I get where you're coming from but you don't have to be a douche about it, we're all in this together man.
---
A lot of people have. Yes. 
---
I don’t really like them either but they are very popular.
---
I feel ya. I just mainline super stims and quantums and pray some dumbass will actually shoot the damn thing.
---
If you decide to build a platform be prepared for a pretty Spartan lifestyle. Foundations, floors and stairs are durable and easy to maintain once built, everything else will however get trashed. Basically the platform and a stash box, scrap box and cooking area is all you're going to want. If you try to build fancy down there you best have a lot of spare scrap on hand for repairs.
---
You are correct I was guessing i thinking 100 point 100 rounds are messed myself up
---
I agree with you. Personally the bugs don't bother me too much. They're annoying, sure, but I don't have that much of my life invested into any video game. It's great when it works, when it doesn't work so good that's too bad, but I can live with it. If I had such big problems with the game, you had better believe I would quit playing. Probably without making a whiny testimonial about it firsthand too.
---
Lots of things sink into the walls and it’s very frustrating.  My buddy found this out that almost every time you place a holiday wreath on a side of a foundation, it sinks in so much that you cannot select it to remove it anymore.  Guess what this jerk bag did with this knowledge? Plaster my camp foundation with holiday wreaths.  Now it’s either live with them or rebuild chunks of my camp from the top down just to get rid of them.
---
As revenge, I have slowly been maxing his camp budget by hiding flamingos and confetti all over his camp.  He has yet to notice the nearly 40 flamingos I have strategically placed in places like behind a weapons work bench, hidden in his razor grain crops, behind his vending machines, or even hidden inside walls themselves.
---
Personally I hope they attack us when they arrive and we're offered a choice to join'um or be permanently hostile with them. But joining them actually costs something, like no mutations.
---
Uh, ok then I guess..
---
The helmet is great to complete the set, but make sure you have the undersuit with shielded mod. +4 end, +4 str, and +2 per!
---
as a 1st u have a scrapbox for unlimited prime materials. I wish we could have unlimited stash.. i would buy 1 year supscription
---
I'm sure you know this already since you're a regular here,but why don't you make a new toon for the locales challenges? My friend discovered it back when the patch finally allowed them and I did them all in less than an hour. I only need to conolete the collect wood,so to me,the obly buggwd challenge is the SBQ one.
---
I didn’t know this and the first usage of the “improved” ammo converter resulted in three minutes of backing out of a damn terminal.
---
Armco? No my good sir 🤣 That machine is about as useful as a nocturnal pipe pistol. I have 40 ammo machines hooked up to 8 fusion generators deep underground hidden somewhere in Appalachia. I call it, the heart of 76, cause when all the machines are powered at once and in sync it sounds like a giant mechanical beating heart... Soothing 😁
---
Yep, just like how you can craft different levels of armor once you hit those levels, the same happens with the the Tadpole Backpack.  The Level 50 one gives you 60 carry weight, and there's mods that do everything from give you an additional 60 (at the cost of some damage resistance), to the Refrigerated one which reduces the capacity to 30 but is basically GwS, as well as other things like a mod that reduces the weight of all chems by 90%.

Still don’t want it.
---
I thought it was a good idea but I needs to be able to convert more at once.
---
But they aren't like that yet that will take atleast 5 more years
---
It’s the same reason people bitch about Star Wars or Star Trek or any other big franchise. When you invest so much time into something it becomes very personal. From time to time we all forget it is just a game,but it is something into which we have invested a lot of time (and money).  I mostly see it as people just venting, which is normal.
---
just roleplaying my raider lifestyle, welcome to fallout ♥  
---
try to repair the files if possible (idk if playstation let that happen), or reinstall the game if it bugs you.
---
But they aren't like that yet people theink they are because of fallout 4 and 3 but they aren't yet because this takes place 26 years after the bombs dropped remember
---
Who hurt you
---
Because they like the game but this doesn’t mean that the game is flawless, there’s still a lot to complain about and they want to voice their opinions and direct their anger at the developers who neglect these issues. 
---
Personally I don’t complain on the sub, and I also like the game, but it’s the buggiest game I ever played in my life and if I ever decided to complain there will be a lot of things to complain about
---
Stream was 0/10 for me; not enuff cleavage
---
Yeah I know, but you said storage was limited. That’s all I was replying to. If I would’ve been replying to your actual post I would’ve said “don’t worry...da dupers got it taken care of!!!
---
😎😎”
---
They have a weight, I believe they’re under misc
---
They're in miscellaneous, they weigh 0.1. as for the limit I have no idea. I assume there's no limit but the amount you get is random. sometimes I get 5, today I only got 1 or idk, I don't pay much attention to be honest.
---
If it’s any conslation, I’ve done the same thing more than once.
---
Finally started buying backup serums (I have 4 mutations) when I found them under 300 caps.
---
  Now I don’t worry too much about it - went through a period of need a cap sinks, so bought the recipes from Modus.  Make my own if I need one:)
---
I think in general railroad spikes use too much steal to yield a useful conversion. However, they are a useful choice if you don’t want to farm lead and gunpowder.
---
i have like 200 of them. so i guess u can get as many times as u did sbq events. their weight = 0.1 in "other" section.
---
I didn’t turn in one unit of steel. I don’t plan on turning in one unit of cork or concrete either
---
Oh my gosh that's amazing, I just saw another reply... the blueprinted one from the workshop. That's so fucking awesome lol
---
Still got confused when sell and buy in the ammo converter and still got bug when do it in power armor.
---
Works! You absolute legend!
---
Because not everybody has Fallout 1st and can afford the extra weight in their stash box. Pack rat is a much easier way to keep junk except it has to be on you. Remember before 1st when we all had to bulk our junk? They could fix this by only dropping non-bulked junk. Or giving away the scrap box.
---
Senpai Todd needs to discipline us uwuuu &gt;~&lt;
---
Be careful with this one. It reeeeeeally brought out my inner hoarder with 5 pieces 😂
---
I did think about looking into crafting and then converting but I feel like that's only good for weird stuff like flamer fuel??
---
Lmao GG Bethesda, I gotta try this
---
Claim workshops, finish Defend events, sleep/eat cranberry foods/drink cranberry nuka cola, farm events like Collision Course while in a Building public team
---
Agreed I think I have 150k in steel still. And like only 3 k lead in back stock ATM with another 2k of acid.
---
Unlimited, but random reward from completing the event. They do have weight, and they're under miscellaneous.
---
who cares
---
Switch servers
---
They are in MISC and yes they have weight. With my f76 I only use them to repair anything and never go below 65.
---
There shouldn't be a limit to how many you can have but they start to weight a bit when you reach 150-200+
---
Try and get 5 pieces, it makes guns weigh like 1, sometimes in the 0. Values. Beware your game gets pretty laggy if you hold heaps of legendaries.
---
Well. Anyone who replies. People who don’t care don’t offer an opinion. So you at least.
---
Do you go multi-level? I thought about doing that but only one level wouldn't give that much space... how deep down can you go!?
---
It updated with a server tick, usually noon eastern time.
---
I had a friend in the server, he was the lvl 9
---
Perhaps the game was rigged from the start? Heard it from Benny.
---
Yup, the least they could do is use all the loot that drops off the animal.
---
In order for Mrgph to (potentially) sell you a legendary version, you have to have the plan....
---
Agree.  Apparently there is bonus money to make things shitty.  Sure, give us what we want, but make it a pain the ass and not really worth it.  smh.
---
Do you use bloodied?
---
Exactly my experience!
---
They should just disable the daily and weekly SCORE challenges for anyone who reaches Rank 100 and convert the repeatable 100 SCORE for 10,000XP give you 10 atoms instead. I'd grind the heck outta that and it'd keep me logging in and engaged.
---
Or is it 24? It took like 5 mins to get through it all
---
We still play and enjoy the game, but that doesn’t mean it’s perfect. There are A LOT of things that have been there since beta that just need to be fixed, and Bethesda time and time again proves incompetent. Oh yay, vault boy now has a laser rifle instead of a laser musket on a photo mode frame none of us knew existed. But the fast travel bug is still there.
---
Depends on what one ways the cost of steel vs steel, lead, and acid.
---
Also just a note apparently when colossal problem comes out killing wendigo spawn with a flamer with give fuel on drops ( saw this in one pf juiceheads videos on youtube cant recall which one)
---
Well i had very unpleasant PvP experience in adventure mode back in the say when I was a new player. Now I know what it's like and never engage it. If I claim a workshop I make sure I have no valuable junk on me and even if it's not taken by anyone yet, just in case, I sneak somewhere and wait till it's claimed and leave as soon as possible. I also have pa on and I know I wouldn't stand a chance against some bloody sneaky sniper junkie. Not to mention those people are likely to have assassin weapons. It's not like I hate PvP, but I hate it in this game. Even nuclear winter is more fun than PvP in adventure mode.
---
Oh no now I can't play interior decorator
---
Here’s a question, how soon after you sign up do you get your first batch of atoms? 
---
If you get them as soon as you purchase a subscription then I may do it for a month at a time.  For instance this week I paid $9.99 for atoms. And I’ve done that a couple times since I’ve been playing since March.
---
The exact same thing happened to me yesterday on PC
---
Why didnt you do it by 100x, instead of 1x?
---
its about the same number of posts that complain as there are that are just boot licking.
---
I went for 2 levels, you can go 3 but I made the top level just a platform for the terminal.
---
It hasn't been a year yet so maybe they cycle through again on a yearly basis but so far no.
---
I’m sure at least one person has asked for the BoS.
---
I’m sure as many if not more would like to see the new factions revived.  Free States, Responders, Mistresses of Mystery, Cult of the Mothman.  We got some interesting backstory then wiped them out, only to dig up the “usual”, which is the rut Bethesda and many other companies fall into:  going back to the old and familiar.
---
tesla rifle bug. they fucked up teslas even more with this update.
---
You really seem racist. That's... kinda sad, actually.
---
You are wasting points on Aquagirl and green thumb. Just put those on when needed. Same with scrapper and chemist. I know it's chore to change but those points could be put to better use as they are not needed other than a few specific situations.
---
you can only hold 256 of them..
---
Cuz there's no option to?
---
Is there any reason for an end game player to be using these?  Do they have any rare drops or anything?
---
Only for the duration of the ownership. Once taken over by another player it resets and you can take it back for a fresh and clean budget
---
Harpers ferry and the burrows also have a good chance for legendaries. The burrows is my favourite dungeon 😁. Charleston capitol bildung is another good farm spot
---
An analogy of the player base of this game being babies can certainly fit in certain circumstances.
---
Must be some game that was never released, because I dont think the Brotherhood were ever Nazis or Fascists. Unless ignorance has led so many to come to such a wrong conclusion.
---
That is so weird, I guess your ammo converter is broken. We all got a  change in the menus when the patch hit.
---
Well I'm afraid to ask for anything in this game because of possible bigger problems xD but I personally like brotherhood of steel, but not fallout 4 version. they were an interesting faction in older games, ofc not many people played original fallout and most judge them by the shitty version seen in Fallout 4. But I'm curious to see how they started and maybe why they turned into such jerks in the end. I would like to see enclave too, secret service also seems interesting.
---
When was this?!?!
---
So link that proof. Because consoles can only max out at 30 FPS. They are hard locked to that number.  PC can go higher but was limited for a while until they unlocked the frame rates.
---
So please cite source that the consoles were unable to achive or maintain 30 fps.  Because that search only leads to a post about PC.
---
That’s nothing, the airport fits 65 at once with room for more if planned correctly.
---
I’ll be on tonight around 8:30 ET if you still need help questing/leveling.
---
We have enough currencies
---
cross platform wtf?
---
we shouldnt have legendary PA pieces bcz it is way OP without any legendary effects though the excavator PA has two hidden legendary effects. U will be shred in a couple shots anyway :) 
---
If u need to claim a workshop for score do it and change the server. But speaking of score it is ok to let other players to grab ur workshop.
---
Yeah I remember.  I just did not horde.  This is not FO4.  You don't need to pick up everything and save everything that you find.
---
I have the location challenges done, but I see it brought up often enough that I know it's still not fixed
---
The chances of getting a good roll legendary that is useful or be worth anything for a late game player is so low that people want all the chances they can get, especially if they don't go to trading forums
---
Thx. I had a 1+ year big camp made using almost any building trick and will have to rebuild it when they'll fix the camp device skin.hopefully i'll still be able to,even tho I don't really look forward to that effort.
---
haha look everybody, they said the funny reddit thing
---
More specifically the wendigo spawn drop ammo for your currently equipped weapon. That includes ultracite ammo ;)
---
There are 4 other posts about enforcer posted in the last week with similar titles.  You should check them out.
---
Last week
---
Currently have 470 in my stash.  Wish I could give them away to lower level players or something.  The only limit seems to be how much weight you can store or carry.
---
Dont come in here with your common sense and logic
---
Armour does reduce the weight of mods. Its when you have rw on the weapon itself that it does not
---
Should've worked like the reloaders bench in nv where you scrapped rounds for base components like lead, steel and gunpowder
---
It's an effect applied to the character while you have the armor equipped, not a hidden attachment on an item, so it does affect all weapon mods
---
Ok, thank you for letting me know.
---
Lol I’m guessing no plus there’s already loads of cobalt flux on the east side of whitesprings when you nuke it. As long as you just barely include the golf club in the nuke zone on the left then all along the highway on the right there is cobalt flux
---
Like in fallout nv
---
Oh really?! Well now I really need to get some of that armor.
---
Thanks!
---
Bethesda is incapable of letting go of the brotherhood. They seem to think they're a big deal in the Fallout lore.
---
I learned to claim workshops when I am getting ready to leave the game to avoid PVP.  I do not build anything unless it for the day's building challenge.  The people that attack want to kill another player not claim the workshop in most cases.
---
That's a really good idea!  I wish I had an answer for you, but really I just want to give props to your creative thinking.
---
I don't know how to play without it anymore. Keep all my weapons on me, use my stash only for other things, and at least 4 pieces of weapon weight reduction at all times. It eliminates the possibility of a full bonus stealth thorn armor set, but it feels good enough as it is
---
i replied bcz u r wrong. 1st dont have unlimited stash. i dont care if u want it or not. i dont care if all my best friends want this feature or not.
---
Not as awesome as you may think. I'd highly suggest looking into the quirks with the ammo factory glitch before getting too excited (all in all not really worth it at your camp)
---
Yeah, I rock a full set so when I get over weight in my pa I just jump out and my weight goes down astronomically. It 100% does reduce the weight of modded weapons
---
I got an instigating gauss shotgun that, with all the 3 shotgunner perks + rank 1 demo expert, a sneak attack does a crazy 2260 damage on a target with full health.
---
Now if they could just fix the bug that reflects that damage back onto me when I've already killed something but it's hitbox bumps into me after the fact, that'd be great. Earlier I had a scorchbeast reflect it back at me with it's take-off stagger.. it's really god damn annoying.
---
I like those odds.
---
Bethesda just kind of screwed all of the Brotherhood of Steel roleplayers by giving us low outpur Energy Weapons, and basic Power Armor. I don't think it's OP as it is, but that's because the people who killed me quick usually have the basic Builds in place.
---
Nice!
---
I can’t be wrong about not wanting fallout first 
---
You replied because you a shit person that like being an asshole.
---
So you can’t drop them? Or dropping them means breaking them?
---
Fact is they'll never do more than this,since any new player should not encouter any problem.
---
No, can’t do it on built objects, either yours or a teammates. Only works on NPC flora/crops.
---
That's a poor novelty at best without a rework of how pets are kept. Can't count the number of pets and rare pets I've lost to the game. RIP 'Cat'
---
I think it will just make every player stronger. Not specifically effecting current play styles. Just edging us more toward a bloodied sniper or heavy gunner tank... but We don’t know for certain yet
---
When you skip Nuclear Winter Dailies you're missing out on 1750 S.C.O.R.E. per week.
---
Not that it's really worth it, tbh.
---
Another dude gave a perfect reason why it's not as easy as just dumbing all your ammo in. Think about people selling ammo. Quite a lot of people actually buy it from other players, but being able to convert all ammo would ruin that 100%, because you would have no reason to buy anymore.
---
I think the converter is fine as it is now, because i can get a decent amount of ammo, but it dies not hurt sales for others.
---
Oh that's what I thought 😕 thanks for responding
---
"Nah, too easy" Bethesda
---
Yeah, this common occurrence has me stashing Junk a lot more often in Workshops. The thing that gets to me is the core Workshop I keep for use is the one they always try for. I would assume seeing it all build-up as an indicator it's being used. But some people really like to just be pricks. And Bethesda kind of promotes it with these challenges.
---
Yes and this is not the best sub to ask this question.
---
I took a hyatus from the game in early 2020 and came back for wastelanders, and I'm honestly having a blast playing with my girlfriend.
---
1st subscription is optional but I recommended it, private servers runs better in terms of lag (for me), and the scrapbox is godly
---
If you hate Todd so much, vote to tax him and shut up
---
It's also great for alts👍
---
Ok that was always allowed. For people that don’t want to donate anything, they sure do spend a lot of effort letting people know that.
---
It's magnificent! I appreciate the use of the metal beams to give the impression that the structure is being supported. I don't think enough people do that. My river spanning camp at the base of Grafton Dam has a number of those beams placed for the same reason; there's an upper living space above the lower dock area and I didn't want the upper space to be floating even though the game allows it.
---
Storage is limited.
---
I can't speak to web developer specifically, but programmer salaries in the Northeast (greater boston area) are frequently starting at $60-70k. That said, that salary will also get you a ramshackle hut with 3 roommates and no parking spaces so...
---
I don’t specifically mean grenades, I’m talk about 40mm’s and missles. But shouldn’t hitting the SBQ repeatedly with a quad barrel targeting missle launcher do the equivalent or near damage as a .50 cal?
---
I think sticky grenades would cause players to kill themselves more.
---
You asked what we wanted out of NEXT GEN consoles. I said actual faster frame rates. Plain and simple. You keep arguing  current frame rates 30 fps are completely fine and don't need to be improved. Lmfao.
---
The food reductionon the armour doesn't work for me.
---
This is unfortunately true. I'm starting to think that I will be better off just using a Private Server to gather resources.
---
Explosive could use a buff for sure to be up to 30% or 40%. Most enemies in this game have a very high explosive resistance on top of their normal resistances, so it would not give as much of a bonus as you would expect. Right now most people are aiming for faster fire rate because it provides much better DPS. It would be nice if explosive was brought up at least close to on par with that except for the few exceptions where it benefits greatly from either a bug or intended mechanic.
---
Two shot is okay as it is, it's to some extent limited by the engine. Since it has that accuracy and recoil penalty, I think buffing it up to at least be on par with junkie's would work. That way you would be able to have a decent trade-off, and since it still synchronizes well with two-shot, you could run a very specialized weapon setup to maximize its potential.
---
Explosive energy weapons are a joke, I've been bringing it up from time to time but clearly bethesda doesn't care. They said they will make adjustments and then bring them back in. Absolutely no adjustments have been made since the start of last year, and the only way they brought them back into the game is unbanning all the dupers who had them. Even though the total proportion of players using these is fairly small, it is the single biggest balance problem in the game right now, even worse than bloodied/unyielding. If it was taken care of a year ago, it would have been too late. At this point, I have no words for it
---
I believe it is so that most of the people who bitch about the game being buggy and such are just players who wants to see it succeed ever since the start but they realized that Bethesda never really did anything to fix it so they result in complaining about the same thing others are just to try and get Bethesda to fix it or at least pay attention to the problems.
---
Vault 76 is just the beginning part for newbies
---
fingers crossed that it will lead to different choices instead of insert generic cookie cutter mold but you maybe right
---
It would’ve been much simpler and easier if every ammo type is worth the same amount of points. I mean I get that 5.56 rounds are more valuable and desirable than .38 ones for example, but it would just make life so much easier
---
So is it a tutorial or what?
---
I get downvoted a lot for my opinions, so I wouldn't say it's all that. There is definitely some Bethesda dick sucking going on as well.
---
Come at me whores.
---
Show me a single video that does that without magic and solo...
---
Wait what
---
I think from memory it just sends you to wayward inn
---
Then mine is broken lol this was like 2 days ago
---
Try a different sub. This one doesn’t allow bartering.
---
well, i don't agree. it's a Wasteland and anyone has a right to take what they want and can, like workshops and your resources, it's just the way it happens not fair, even tho they claim even if your level is much lower you still stand a chance, that's BS. If you have FO1st just farm cores on a private server. I did it once with a friend, now I have 30 cores that never end because I keep finding new ones xD
---
It doesn’t stack with the Food weight reduction perk. It’s maxed at 90%
---
You cant wear armor AND PA. 
---
That said, I mix a zealots, exterminators, ghouls, and vanguard.  I get -15% damage from scorched, mirelurks and ghouls, and have a ton of DR and ER.
---
I run all WWR armor right now. I have two Gauss Minis, an LMG, a Plasma Rifle and an Assaultron Blade...and I still weigh 110
---
That make sense thanks
---
I'd love if they would add a quest to uncover the secrets of the Perfectly Preserved Pie and at the end it unlocks the ability to craft food and drink items that don't spoil.
---
Yea I hear you,
---
it's just the pointless, blithering idiots who make really dumb and selfish posts on here about ALL videos games.
---
How do people expect more content, better content and fixes to come if they get everything for free?  A business needs money to operate.  They can say all the want about Todd, but the dude used a lot of his own money to redeem the company at one point to keep their heads above water.  
---
Truth be told, the only bug in this game that actually affects my playstyle is the fast travel glitch, and there are easy workouts right now for that too lol
---
I'm sorry, but if you're happy where this game is at then I feel sorry for you.
---
The reason people are pissed is because they're passionate and know the game can be so much more.
---
Didn't they take off legendary with rippers in a previous patch, if so that weapon isn't viable either now.
---
For some reason Bethesda doesn't like whirring bladed weapons, it's bad when a literal piece of wood does more damage than a weapon that's meant to cut it ie. chainsaw
---
rw?
---
They dropped me from claiming or defending workshops. If you were on pc I'd give you for free. they're not that rare. But chickens from legendary run indeed make more and take less space.
---
I am on PC. I will double check this evening in case I am mistaken. Thanks for the reply.
---
Oh please yes I need this!
---
The only things you don't keep are the ability to deposit things into your scrapbox (you can still take things out and use whatever's in there) and the ability to start a private server. All the icons, skins, whatever else are yours to keep
---
Can you just tell us?
---
Such a great idea!
---
When it claims we have done 80 million cork in a day will u then realise it matters not what anyone donates?
---
Yes, you keep all stuff that you can unlock in atom shop
---
Just don’t be surprised if Beth band you 2 months from now when they finally get around to fixing this exploit.
---
Well I have a huge camp😂 and with the recent update where they made the budget cost of foundations made me even more fucked😂😂
---
They added a chassis at the entrance,  pretty sure they are making changes to 96. I can't wait 😮
---
I guess I meant replace and keep the mechanics of it. But definitely let's.keep both at a camp! They could interact.
---
Reduced weight
---
That would be awesome! How *does* that slice of perfectly preserved pie keep ending up on the roof of the West Tek building, I wonder...
---
The first time I just figured I messed up but after 3 times I'm positive it's not the alcohol I'm consuming.
---
&gt; It just shows how this pass was designed to enslave you to force you to log in every day if you expect to reach level 100.
---
Does it, though ?
---
While I know the levels get longer - it's not *that* much longer.  You don't have 50% of the score left to get;  but we still have 50% of the season left.
---
Now - if you argued that you have to play *every week* to get it;  I might buy it.  Because the challenges are weighted higher on the weekly side.
---
But my feeling is if you do the weekly challenges + 50-60% of the daily (which is not every day) - you should get pretty close.  And if that's still too much?  Well - you are damned if you do, damned if you do.  If you make it too easy?  People finish it in 10 minutes and complain.
---
Yyeess!!
---
I’ve been saving cork since they announced this event because the number of items that give cork is few.
---
Also that’s just what negative people like you are using to cover your ass. First it’s no ones going to do any of this then you claim that it’s all fixed because.
---
Thanks! It was too tempting to run around as NCR
---
How much do U have?
---
Can't be sold or traded and dropping them destroys them.  Basically act like atomic shop items. 
---
If someone were to give me their gear I could repair all their stuff for them....but who is going to trust "let me have all your gear and I will repair it for you and then give it right back!". LMAO.
---
That's exactly my theory on why they didn't use a vendor UI, despite all the suggestions for it that we know they heard. I'm betting they're afraid of introducing another vendor duping bug that they would have to spend time fixing.
---
The score system is to limit your atoms and encourage you to buy atoms.
---
This suggestion isn't in line with that
---
Unlimited amounts
---
Great question. I circled around it chaotically and used my auto-stimpack perk. I did notice there weren’t as many hellblasts when I was hitting it, I am not sure if that is luck or interruption.
---
For years now, the harshest critics of this game have often boasted about how high level they are in Fallout 76, meaning they've played for at least 40+ hours on a game they hate
---
Sentient Racoons he says.
---
Yes.   I had to get rid of her.
---
Read a book ya hippie haha

---
&gt;Lmao. Not even close.
---
Your lie is easily disproven.  Your statement is directly saying the game lacks the standard FPS for a game on this console generation so you expect more frames in the next.  You then refuse to provide a link when asked to disprove this and the only search is PC.
---
If you were talking about getting an FPS boost over current gen then literally all you had to say was some variation of:  
---
I want to see the FPS increase from 30 to at least 60 on the next gen console. 
---
Instead your reply was specifically about the game not having actual standard fps for this generation.
---
No. Water purifiers are what you need.
---
Maybe because the positive players are playing the game, not complaining on Reddit?
---
Also I agree completely on Morrowind. You know, aside from getting lost anytime I looked for anything.
---
If you put more than 256 of them in your stash you can never get them out.
---
That and the horrible, "I never thought I'd be so lucky as to hook up with someone like you."   Barf.
---
So u can’t answer a simple question. I’d guess 1000?
---
It's current content.  It bugs out sometimes and won't let you in though.  Switching servers should fix it.  There is a short quest down there and it's a good place for xp and legendary farming.
---
I’m not sure that’s a drop. You’d need to just get it in a roll from the purveyor at the rusty pick.
---
Lol, I prefer the brotherhood of steel. If only they were a little more merciful to sane ghouls.
---
Oh my sweet summer child... 
---
The burrow were a dungeon that Bethesda implemented *waaaay* back when to help the endgame. Didn’t hear much about it after its release. It was supposed to be a repeatable dungeon from what I remember, and it didn’t pan out.
---
Yes. I should’ve been more specific, thrown hand grenades don’t need love, I agree. Snipers are very viable... a TSE dragon use to be king, now they are used so much less than commandos because of the Two shot nerf. If brought back up to par I’m sure we would see a lot more. 
---
Magic isn’t helping shotguns like they should tho... Magic heavy guns are extremely broken, shotguns should be OP with magic not just okay.
---
She didn't even last a day.
---
I can answer a simple question.
---
Oh ok didn’t know that thanks
---
I like you.
---
I'm not sure what plans are rare or not, I usually just list them 1-20 caps tops and weapons armor at 40% of the lowest price in the price estimator. Otherwise I scrap them if they don't sell when inventory gets too full.
---
So answer it. How much cork do U currently have
---
Keep killing legendaries and pray to the rng gods. That or any of the myriad of broken legendary weapons that you get along the way will be even better
---
I've been playing since beta and I tried that group, it wasn't for me.
---
What gets me is the mass of posts complaing about a building glitch being 'fixed' there are alot bigger things to worry about in the game than 2 sided walls rn.
---
Thanks for the headsup. I guess they really are useless.
---
I looked it up. I had no idea OG Fallout had intelligent mutated Racoons that founded the burrows until just now.
---
Well the content was cut apparently but still.
---
They are. They’ve been a part of the lore since the beginning. They are as much a part of Fallout lore as Vault-Tec. 
---
And there’s literally a game called [* Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel*](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout:_Brotherhood_of_Steel), so it makes sense that Bethesda thinks they’re a big deal in the lore.
---
they didnt screw us. i use uny set generally bcz of special bufs and it was so important during legendary run but i am a very easy target if any lag. I have t51, ultracite, excavator, t65, x01 to actually play the game according to my build. And based on my experience PA is very tanky and way better for DR/ER. Some say that ss set has the same stat or higher but it doesnt work same way. try it for urself.
---
New Vegas ammo crafting became tedious because it wasn't built around crafting like 4 or 76, so gathering so many specific things was just more difficult.
---
No. Your an asshole and nothing upset an asshole like leading them on and refusing to play their game.
---
Theres nothing particularly wrong with it, I think overall its just a poor use of a really cool space. Ghouls are such an easy enemy to fight. It didn't help that Bethesda advertised it as a dungeon for 2 50+ players, when its easily soloable at 50 with a competetent build.
---
Simple suggestion: give 5 or 10 Atoms for every 3500 Score past Rank 100.
---
I think I was just hoping Beyond hope, because I know that the sentient raccoons we're a part of Fallout lore that just never really got implemented they were the two raccoons that escaped the fev testing labs and they were supposed to create a society next to the glow...sigh I've always wanted a trash panda companion
---
The glow sights aren't lined up right either when you ADS its slightly above the crosshair
---
Excuse me, but you already have a cow that gives you milk and poop. Let’s have a little more respect here.....
---
That was the best I could find. It would be nice to have a community price checker that gets updated often. The info is scattered around for sure.
---
Yeah it’s pretty cool! I wouldn’t say any more effective then on the ground but definitely creative
---
A legendary weapon like that you need to buy from another player (be prepared to pay a lot of caps for it) or just keep killing legendary enemies for a small chance to MAYBE get it. 
---
Same thing with the purveyor. 
---
The prime receiver you can mod yourself if you have the plan, or pay/ask a friend to do it for you
---
Yea, I still want rocket with a gatling laser as a companion haha, we can always dream
---
Yes its true, but when it comes to things like atomic shop items that dont work, like the camo ss underarmor and the junkyard power armor and bugs that exist forever and can get super annoying, like the fast travel bug, people have every right to complain.
---
U can still dupe them
---
Yes! I need atoms I see good stuff but don't have atoms to buy them
---
Well, why didn't they add an internal/double wallpaper wall? Sure some people will use them as outside walls.  So what?
---
We're you teamed up?
---
You can buy additional gold bullions for caps from Smiley at Wayward. 300 bullions per week. FYI
---
Piss off. This sub's shilling is the reason the game currently sucks dick
---
Well I just got on the Fallout Wiki and apparently the Racoons escaped the lab in 2101. So technically they would still be around in 2102. Hypothetically.
---
The Imposter Assaultron Head skin doesn't work in NW either and that's been out for a year. I bought it specifically for NW. You can tag the assaultron head skin for NW but it doesn't apply.
---
lol see u can’t answer a simple question. As for covering my arse. I’m going to complete legendary so don’t care about a double weekend. I don’t care about a beret. The purveyor sale means little as I already have everything i need in the game with a lot to spare. My point is. There’s not a chance 250 million cork will be donated. As u said. You’ve been collecting since it was announced and you have so little you can’t even answer a simple question. Now obviously with your childlike reaction to a very simple question any number I do claim will be viewed as an utter lie. Point is it matters not if u donate 1 or 20 thousand or even a million. Every stage of it will be completed. If it wasn’t rigged to succeed it would have a live counter just like the Do in other games.
---
You sound like an ungrateful brat who was spoiled as a child
---
It's better than wandering around the map, unable to find a way to remove your bounty.
---
The blood eagle skin for the handmade is also fucked up lel.
---
The problem with placing it at your camp is it's not scrapable or moveable. Private server workshops FTW.
---
I think it fits in with Bethesda’s ‘you da man!’ approach, as they try to make the player feel like the most important person in that universe. Look at Skyrim, that had people constantly waffling repeated lines at you as you walked through a town.
---
When I finished Radiation Rumble last night, and stuck around to loot the meat piles, I think it was literally one and a half minutes between Melody Larkin spouting one of her lines. That’s crazy.
---
Lol you really are a
---
Touchy little bit arnt you 😂😂😂
---
Same thing happened to me. I got bored of it.  After a couple of months of not playing it's fun again.
---
Oh sure. I do some of the NW ones, but not all of them - the time to reward ratio for them is too low. Which is its own problem! 
---
Maybe if it didn’t take 15 minutes to queue for a round I would bother hunting down, say, three creatures. But if that takes three rounds, that’s 45 minutes of *queueing*. 
---
I sort of assumed the person I was replying to was skipping the NW ones too, as doing all the adventure dailies consistently in 30 minutes sounds challenging. Doing them in 10 minutes (if you queued in NW for 15 and spent 5 in a match to do the NW challenge) seems impossible.
---
Awesome that is really thanks you 👍
---
It wasn't updated in real time. once a day it was
---
Yeah all with 1 other guy.
---
Sorry to hear, fren
---
LOL. I can answer a simple question. What you are too stupid to understand, because you're an asshole is that I am not answering it on purpose, because it's clearly getting under your skin.
---
Now go back to the market place forum and sell your duped items. Cheater.
---
I thought Legendary Run unlocks were account based. I only play 1 character so I’m not 100% sure.
---
Rad x by accident? Maybe other players had no mutations.
---
No it’s just a glitch all platforms can do there are many videos on it
---
My commie collectron can pick up purified water. Not consistently but I'm pretty sure he can. But water purifiers is what you're after
---
They could have just let us sell ammo and adjusted the economy accordingly. They were just lazy.
---
Vanguard - best choice for junkies build. Imho there are only 2 meta builds - blood &amp; junkie
---
Not working for me and my combat shotty is broken. Pump still works fine, but I can bash people for more damage than shooting them with combat shotty about 60% of the time.
---
Unscrapable, unmoveable, and the last machine placed controls an entire powered group.
---
How’s it getting under my skin 😂😂
---
For someone claiming they don't care, you sure are suddenly stalking me around the forum. 
---
Dupper.
---
Flame on!
---
That would require changing more than a couple lines of code.
---
with the most recent patch they removed persistent servers, we cant transfer items between characters on a f01st server anymore because each time we log out and back in even after a few seconds we are on a new server.  this doesn't happen to everyone just most.
---
so how can we have persistent workshops if we cant even keep the same server anymore
---
Isn't it just a visual bug?  It says I'm getting -3 STR from egghead but my stats have not changed.
---
No they are account wide, apart from the currencies
---
lol. Never duped a thing. I’m sure u have tho. Or maybe mummy won’t let u. I checked your very last post because I wondered if u were an angry little prick or just having an off day. Angry little prick it is tho. 😂😂😂
---
They're just sort of losers from the first game. Beth needs to get over them.
---
Sweet thanks
---
This is what I hated about this whole "event."  The amount of steel you drop had nothing to do with the quality of your reward.
---
 As per your suggestion, I did go back and read their response. And my comment was based on what I gathered from their response and the community's thoughts as I have been seeing them. Not that I knew it all.  I've also edited my first comment to reflect this better as I was just waking up and didn't put a lot of effort into the original comment. If you have some other insight I would like to here out of general curiosity. Have a great day!

Hello everyone,
---
We want to acknowledge that we hear your concerns about the fixes we released for C.A.M.P. building in Patch 21. So many of you are incredibly passionate about C.A.M.P.s in the community, and we absolutely love the creations you share with us and everyone else. 
---
To give you more context, these fixes addressed issues that, while seemingly harmless on the surface, could and were being used by some individuals to take advantage of unintended exploits. Something we overlooked is how this would impact certain quirks in the C.A.M.P. building system. This is unfortunate, and it was not our intention to limit or remove parts of the C.A.M.P. system, but those issues needed to be fixed.
---
That said, we really appreciate all that you do and create, and we want to do right by you. The situation is not as simple as reverting changes, which could cause exploits and performance issues to return. However, we are actively looking into our available options to bring some of these building methods back to 76 in a more intended and secure way. For example, we’re discussing what it would take to implement double sided walls. 
---
We hear your frustration on this, we’re talking through what we can do to make it better, and as soon as we have more concrete plans in place, you all will be the first to hear about them.
---
As always, thank you all so much for your feedback."
---
I sell them for 10k on PC when I get them.  That seems to be the max any higher people won't buy it
---
I mean... we got a chicken coop. If they give us fricking chickens clucking endlessly in our camp, then we deserve a dog or a cat for the occasional barks/meows.
---
Lunch box and fireworks are also on the character you claim it on
---
Hi bud, the general setup is starched + class freak for the mutations build. If you do not have these maxed out, I would advise stashing any serums that you come across.
---
There's more to being a Junkie than a like of white NA keytags. ;) What else are you doing with the character?
---
My Junkie is a sneak/VATS crit rifleman. Because rifles are heavy and I'm way too invested in perception/agility/luck to have much strength, I look for WWR and FDCWR above almost all else. 
---
I have at least one Chameleon piece on unless things are going really badly that day, and I like "harder to detect while sneaking" a lot.  I like a good Life-Saving or Auto-Stim in the mix when it's convenient. Since my endurance is a 1, an endurance determines how much AP all AP-using actions use, that's probably the stat I go after, given the choice. And since there's no benefit to high rads or low health, I default to Vanguard's when possible.
---
Note that I schlep around, like, three sets of armor: one for when I have to haul weapons to scrap, one for the rest of the time when FDC is more important, and a full ultralight Unyielding set (with a red. wt. Gamma Fun, natch) for NPC interaction.
---
I do love the chicken coop to. One of my favorite things now. I'll be complete if I catch a cat staring into the chicken coop.
---
The fact that you went through my comment history and went and started replying to older comments to try and bait me? 
---
Yeah, that's how I got under your skin. Cause that's what people who don't care do. Go back and find old comments to reply too.
---
By being patient like everyone else.
---
I'm seeing same stuff right now. Like class freak isn't working. I get the extra buffs, but all the negitive are like the cards not working. Hmmmmmm
---
I had quit for several months after patch 5/6 and I think I had heard about the rippers. But yeah splinters are painful lmao
---
We will have to disagree with the magic shotty, my son is one shotting mirelurk queens with his build and he doesn't even have nerd rage going. Think it is two shots for a level 85 scorchbeast but if he had nerd rage it would be one.  
---
Personally I am abusing the TSE ultracite laser pistol on my gunslinger. It is a blast one shotting everything at a range or 212 also allows solid dps on the queen while she is hovering. The extra shot still splits into 5 so you get 10 or 12 pellets and acts like a shotty and is magic if you have the armor piece on. Wish I had a TSE plasma to try that also though.   
---
I think the only magic shotgun that doesn't work properly is the gauss right now it seems to either be all in or all miss.  
---
Overall with the game being broken with magic with a bit of creativity all weapons are viable. Some are just more reliable than others. TS33 commando rifle can get magic but you need to be pretty close for it to pop right. I think only the semi auto ballistics are the only category that can not be abused with magic and I am sure that has to do with fire rate and how two shots register to fire but honestly I haven't even tested it.   
---
Though at the end of the day if you are in PA heavy and shottys/splits are the only viable magic options since you can not use the +15% armor.
---
The perks on armor only count when you're not in your PA unless something huge changed.
---
Just remember that if you need to get into power armour for any reason you will find yourself horribly over encumbered
---
I didnt say I only play 30mn per day, I say the challenges takes me 30mn a day, I can get some extra xp, but I don't think it's really relevant exept during the 2\*xp event.
---
Now, still, most challenges are quick (camp, eat this, cook that etc...  
---
Legendary is really easy, a lot of events have some legendaries (Awol, uranium fever etc...), do a run at west tek, it almost always have 2-3 legendaries. ScorchBeast sapwn point also have legendaries very often.
---
For the xp: use inspirational\*\*\* in group, sleep bonus, and the squirrel Stew in group with Carnivore it gives +25%. total +45% xp, if you need to rush more, use a vault box, Now you are at +70%, then eat a brain scorbeast +8 INT.   
---
I also have a full unyeilding armor, my INT is \~30 usually in a full Construction team.
---
At this point a superMutant lvl 68 is around 500xp each. (they were at 1k xp during the xp\*2 event)
---
One run west tek + some daily quest,  you get your level ... (\~5 challenges at 100 xp). 
---
A very good event is Surface to air, if you can kill a scorchbeast quickly, they respawn all the time, they worth 1k xp each.
---
I assure you: it's quick
---
Just checked the last one 😂 if I did check more woukd I find u being a prick on every post. Entitled little boy aint ya lol.
---
But I don't wanna 😥😥😂
---
*On PC.  Consoles don't have a choice.
---
They suck at coding.
---
Took off and put back on class freak, stats some correct now.
---
This.  If a mod is good I'll donate but I'm not going to pay to find out if its good or not
---
It should have, but I suspect the dupers have exploited anything with an interface, like vendors, vending machines and the scrip machine. Bethesda likely programmed it this way with that in mind. 
---
It's really unfortunate that we're stuck with the terminal system, which let's be honest, has been shit since Fallout 3.
---
Nuking Morgantown will yield a lot of cobalt. Mutfruit and bloodleaf everywhere.
---
I think OP has water purifiers, just wants a collection to gather the output while away.
---
Ignore people that say go for vanguard, honestly go for a bolstering/unyielding combo, try to use a junkies/bloodied hybrid build. Adrenal reaction and a few defensive perks stacked with bolstering/unyielding armour is going to give you a tankier build that any vanguard could. 
---
I run 2 bolstering and 3 unyielding, It makes my vats commando build capable of one shotting nearly everything. But I can still run at full health with a reasonable damage output for events like encrypted,
---
If on PC you can change the color in the .ini file.  I have mine set to purple gives the wasteland a creepier feel
---
It’s too late to be fixed
---
I'm a junkie and it's awesome
---
So a coinstar, but for ammo? I'm in.
---
Are you a low level perhaps and the sbq died fast? If you don't do enough damage you don't get rewards but it will still say you completed the event. I launch a nuke just about every night and have never, not gotten repair kits... I'm swimming in those damn things.
---
Some people do actually quit playing the game, yet they still, for some unexplainable reason, hang around complaining about the game they no longer play.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
I really don't think its visual. I only noticed because my intelligence is all over the place
---
It will be added to the atomic shop soon!
---
The amm converter already has a new currency...
---
Most people don't seem to realize that instead of fixing everything, Bethesda could've just dumped this game, but no, they consistently put out new content and updates no matter how much hate they get for it

---
 &gt; It will be added to the atomic shop soon!
---
Yup that pretty much sums up the main threats lol
---
Perfect ending -&gt; But.. I still play it every day 😔
---
Same here! Hahah
---
Not you mate the other guy lol
---
yea yeah. maybe:) anyway it is ok to point out a new bug  to let us know (if ur topic isnt the 20th one). but it looks so stupid when players put: "u should do this bcz we told u". I mean who the \*\*\*k u r to write this way?! So hilarious they are sometimes :) Before joining the reddit i was amazed how some mechanics are so well implemented to make the game balanced.
---
You get your atoms every month on the subscription renews
---
Pretty sure we get them monthly
---
I personally thought it should be a trade window, like with vendors or NPCs. Like you put everything you’re giving up in, and then you see the cost of what you want to buy on the other side. Then you either use all the credit you put in, or you gain the remaining points and can use them next time. 
---
Bam. Nice easy window that’s simplified visually and mechanically. I think anyway. Not sure how difficult it would be for them to implement, but given the vending machines I don’t think it would be too hard.
---
&gt; properly implement double-sided walls
---
Just add a new wall set that's just a frame and each side is treated as a different wall when you apply a wallpaper. You basically put two modified/simplified wall models together into one buildable object.
---
None of us do.
---
I suspect today's reset or Tuesdays
---
If not; at the end of Alpha
---
I think it's a thing that can happen with that quest, I thought it had been fixed though... Obviously not!
---
They should have. But unfortunately, it doesn't seem like the camp building is in the front seat for this Fallout title. Which is a shame because of how wonderful it is in FO4. Even without mods Fallout 4's settlement building is one of the best ever implemented in any game. Mods just put it on another level. I myself have even made mods for fallout 4's settlement building.
---
For aluminum go to Top of the World and pick up all the ski poles. Each one gives 2 aluminum.
---
Doesn’t surprise me that they would fuck up a ghost ring.
---
Take my upvote. But if this subreddit is going to change those who have a more positive experience and maybe a mature critical thought of a bug need to be more voiced and not be afraid of downvotes. I feel those who like the game stay quiet and almost feel guilty for liking it
---
What u mean mods are free on consoles
---
Well, she is Lv. 157.  You could muddle your way to Lv. 157, but I think most players generally know what they are doing by that point, however, they may not understand the finer details of the game, builds and why they work, or how the different perks play off one another.
---
Frankly, there's only so much you can do with the Super Sledge, especially if you don't have some kind of gun as a backup.
---
Sure, no problem, RangerAleks on pc
---
ahh because i just got charged for next month, but no atoms yet
---
Pm me if you want to. I'll invite you can go do whatever you want.
---
Sadly not true.  I've had plenty of fully looted scorchbeasts and other people's (empty to me) crates follow me.
---
Do I have to leave and come back
---
All the more reason why they might have quietly nerfed it.
---
I'm not saying they did, but it wouldn't surprise me if it happened one day.
---
My only complaint is the social system. I can never hold a conversation before both mics stop working. But join with xbox chat and flawless sound and no interruptions. Only when xbox chat doesn't fail.
---
The Brotherhood event details are on the splash screen when you log in.
---
Probably more on console PC has a duping problem.
---
When i turn class freak and strange in numbers on and off it changes which mutation are affected
---
I never use radx
---
&gt; schedule an extra 1-2 hrs a day
---
Does it really take that long? it takes me 20 mins tops to complete all the dailies but the NW one (fuck those). level 73 btw
---
Looks like a ton of people are having this issue - pretty sure it's bugged atm
---
Yea lol. I hope that people can report this enough and the ring could be fixed but I *highly* doubt that would happen
---
You sure complain a lot about others complaining...
---
If you’re asking if this is happening to everyone, the answer is no. I have two characters that I use for collecting materials and Scrapper is a must. As of 15 mins ago they both still have this card (Xbox).
---
He’s not saying you’re wrong about your personal opinion. He’s saying that your statement that FO1st gets unlimited stash is incorrect. 
---
FO1st does not get unlimited stash.  That’s not an opinion. That’s a simple fact.
---
What the hell even is this
---
Niether.
---
Welp, iirc i have over 1k of them in my stash.
---
RIP.
---
Tfw they are a bloodied build with literally only 20 health and they come in with an explosive, two shot, two shot, two shot, bloodied gatling plasma with a power armor with all the good mods and they destroy everything there including your team of lvl 40s and lvl 35s.
---
- Check YT videos to understand which build should pass for you. Main meta builds: Bloody build (low health), junkies build (full health) The rest of perks are depending from your weapons: heavy, melee, rifles or pistols 
---
- collect perks according to ur future build
---
- collect weapons &amp; armor according to your future build
---
- take part in all events 
---
- go through main plot of the game 
---
- check trade channels to understand which legendary weapon or armor has any value for trade. You should receive such kind of weapons after events.
---
Takes a few days.  The reason is payment processing.  But it's a pretty stupid system.
---
I agree. It’s kind of a pain as is.
---
Hey u/Ladydevann, when you're raising the concerns about the daily currency limits with the appropriate teams, could you also bring up with them the notion that perhaps they should take another look at the concept of having daily content (daily challenges, daily quests) in the game, because while having daily content is definitely a common trope in a lot of games these days, and while it definitely gets people to play (by pretty much forcing them by using the threat of losing out on stuff), it hasn't been called "daily chores" for at least well over a decade now for no reason.
---
Instead of letting us do 1 thing each day, rather let us do 30 things per month, or 14 things per two weeks, or hell, even 7 things per week.
---
That way, people who have more time to play maybe once or twice per week can get a week's worth of stuff done, without having to try and reschedule their lives around working in the game on their daily chores every single day for a given time.
---
Would be appreciated, thanks.
---
Usually takes 2-3 days for Atoms to show up after renewal.
---
You laugh, but this is basically how i see the Tenderizer.
---
This is a bug currently if you don't put in the t fuse first. We're looking to address this as soon as possible.
---
Their quality as an entity isn’t part of the original debate. The debate was *‘are they an important part of the lore’*?
---
Yes. They’ve been an integral part of the lore, and integral to many of the protagonist plot lines.
---
The worst part is the way it used to be would have been fine, so long as you had sell 12 rounds for x, and a second option Sell all for y.... so simple
---
By any chance was your converter placed before the update?
---
I know I had to rebuild my water wheel after they updated it to produce electricity. Could be a similar issue maybe?

---
I have all the sets as well, and in PVE terms, Power Armor is fantastic. It's just how PVP is imbalanced and makes it seems like you're not wearing any at all.
---
My childhood dog was called Rex, i would love a robodog
---
I've not tried it, but wouldn't it be reasonably efficient to make one double sided wall with the flamer method, then just blueprint it, and clone where needed?
---
After the release of Wastelanders, they merged the original first main quest with the Wastelanders’ first quest. So try to do them both, they’ll lead to to the same place.
---
Nope. Level 215 using TSE legacy weapons. Definitely doing enough damage. I am getting rewards both from the event and from looting the Queen, but no repair kits specifically.
---
Well if u call that a details then.... ok
---
I agree that it is a Wasteland and people can take things, but my complaint is how the PVP is imbalanced in a way that your level has no leverage into it past 50.
---
Just prevents you from picking up more, dupers don't pick up more.
---
If you swing over to the official forums and ask in general discussion you might find one for 6k. A few guys over there do it regularly and sell them.  Don't forget to post that it's Xbox.
---
Its just a cycle of metas,  it was two shot+explosive and explosive+shotgun meta (i remember the time when All Rise supersledge was used by everyone lol). Now bloodied replaced two shot, gauss shotguns replaces explosive shotguns and melee became even stronger. I switched to full hp  vanguard junky for some gampley change, and you know, i can tank way more shit vs bloodied. In my opinion, they should revert two shot, revert explosives, BUT explosives should be major prefix (need to somehow fix existing guns)
---
Submit a ticket to bethesda, lots of the challenges are bugged.
---
Yeah I saw that and it helps but it's still a huge time gate for a person that is willing to commit to a grind. I should be able to sit down and grind out the whole t65 set in a week if I choose to allocate the time to it. It shouldn't artificially force me to wait 2 weeks to get 1 set part.
---
They're meant to be losers from the west coast, their biggest inclusion should be as remnants. Bethesda has a weird fixation.
---
That one cant work that way because the conversion rates arent whole numbers.
---
I did put in the t fuse first i think
---
Y'know, two Fallouts ago? Twelve years ago?
---
Man, I love the ammo press in The Pitt. That worked brilliantly.
---
The ammo machines bug your camp budget.  If you bait them and destroy them he may not be able to build more
---
My suggestion would have been to just have one building category that was just a default wood. Have it include all the assets from the metal, barn, warehouse categories, and make the textures from those wallpapers. And then they should've just let us apply the wallpapers to both sides of any building piece. Then the build menu wouldn't be so cluttered.
---
This is a great idea and not hard to code at all. This is the best fix for the ammo converter I have seen so far.
---
Its kind of true.  I love the game and enjoy playing despite its faults.  But the camp building “fix” and the last patch drew my ire with a few rage posts.  Overall I still play the game daily.
---
Probably, but I never remember to switch them back on when I turn 'em off. Green Thumb especially is vital and easy to overlook.
---
I take it he’s got a bloodied one? Tthe TS/33 DB I used was strong yeah, could kill scorch beast one/two shots but I had to be close. And you can kill a Sb with half clips from Rifles and Heavys without magic.
---
But that pistol is really good, legacy+magic. Not sure you really need a build with it, Just gotta line it up right for the magic
---
With a bit of rounding it could have provided a very similar value.
---
So if I have a weapon with legendary WWR, does WWR armor reduce its weight further to 90% of its reduced weight or is it capped at 90% total so this weapon wouldn't get a reduced weight?
---
Also wires can't be moved anymore not a big issue tell you have a 300 percent built house with a couple wiring issues but actually have stored wires for fixing that issue im so glad I built 15 extra wires on light boxes just so I could fix wires when I need but they removed my ability to move wires its such a little change but it ruined my day fs
---
do Rhododendron have a use?
---
I would detail everything that happened for you to get this bug.  It will stop the downvotes and also help Bethesda locate it for a fix.
---
I've been trying to get banned since December, this game is like crack, I know it's terrible but I just can't stop.
---
Its so weird right. Taking them off then back on definitely helps but they are still not all correct yeah?
---
I noticed this also today.
---
It does. It is a rare spawn in general but on adventure servers so many people visit locations, that they spawn more... Jest play a bit, visit a location, travel away play more, visit our again. You'll find them eventually.
---
This. This is why I keep telling people the low health isn't really a downside and why it's irritating that it's so superior to Junkie's/Vanguard or any other build. What I've heard though is that Berserker's can be the most broken truly glass cannon build.
---
What details? I logged in, joined Adventure mode and all of them were autocompleted. The 5th time this has happened to me.
---
U can see it changing on the special page in pipboy
---
How do you tell total damage for a shotgun, I just get number salad.
---
Gambling is not restricted to currency in currency out. I understand that's what you want, but gambling is risking value for value.
---
You exchange gear for currency and then exchange currency for gear, but you don't control exactly what gear you're buying.
---
So you are taking a known value, subjecting it to risk, in hopes that you will get a superior value result. But anybody who's gotten a nocturnal wooden chest piece with a 10% chance to soak an extra 5% damage knows that you can totally lose that transaction.
---
Gambling is a risk for uncertain reward transaction.
---
I've watched people go on a binge of buying pokémon expansion cards because of the dopamine hit they get from gambling on the contents of the pack.
---
I don’t know why sell all Isn’t an option like “sell all fusion cells”
---
But the devs dont want you to sell a single nuke for n.nnn points. They want you to sell 3 of them at once in order to get points. And it seems fair tbh.
---
They wouldn’t be ‘remnants’ at this point. This is early in their history and they’re closer to their original ideals than in other games. 
---
We’ve never seen this version of the BoS before. And that’s what makes this interesting.
---
this is how i was wanted for the first and only time i have ever been.
---
 i quick logged out went to fo1st server, dropped my junk, then back on to a public server and sat on the porch to my house and waited to be killed, then thanked the guy who killed me :D
---
Take 10 steps
---
i guess we cant have anything new because "oh no the dupers will somehow ruin everything"
---
news flash, they already have, saying dupers will ruin something is beyond irrelevant at this point.
---
the fact that you can only hold 256 would slow down dupers (who are rather impatient) to the point of it not even being attractive.
---
And you bitch about the subreddit you keep coming back to
---
Yes im saying thats a visual bug..
---
They haven't handled them in a very interesting way so far. Just a lazy reuse of iconography, just like super mutants, armies of feral ghouls, caps, etc. Most likely because Beth is worried their work would be unable to stand on its own.
---
Same, I was gonna do a build then said fuck that I am missing some perks I really liked just for a build, not worth it to me fun vs easy mode. I will take fun self "build" over prebuilds or meta builds that make the game easy.
---
This person gets it. 
---
Also that's far from a comprehensive list of things we wouldn't have or would have had to wait a very long time before we'd gotten it addressed, case in point the vendor/display case issue as well as the double-wall "fix".
---
We would have anywhere near as many features in this game or issues resolved without the complaints.
---
Complaints aren't a bad thing. It shows people care enough to want the game and the devs to improve. The worst thing for both Bethesda but also the player base is apathy, where people don't say anything, don't provide any feedback or complain and just walk away from the game.
---
I agree with mot of the tings you said.
---
On my end im likely gonna play until i get to rank 100 on the board then stop playing 76 (at lest every day) until the next big update ala wastelanders comes out, likely the BOS fom what it sounds like.
---
Im already only playing like an hour or 2 a day just to do score challenges and faction dailies and thats it, after that i don't really have any other reason to keep playing.
---
The sum of all the issues with the game: lack of actual engaging endgame content, the bugs with every single things that gets released or has been since launch and i even alpha i bet, the nonsenical and convoluted mechanic/timers (daily caps, etc) are constantly pushing me away from the game.
---
It's only a matter of the right conversion numbers. The current one doesn't sell per piece because it would drive people mad. It's a result of the limitation they did to begin with (a terminal), nothing else.
---
What nonsense logic is that one? If you enjoy something you can't complaint about it?
---
Give them to low level players
---
Burrows is my go-to. Usually has 2-3, sometimes 1-2 more
---
Your mistake here is expecting a douche bag to be capable of having manners.
---
may be placebo, but I'm fairly certain this has gotten worse with the latest patch.
---
i wish it would tell you the quantity of the ammo in your inventory as you trade it in
---
Trust me, if there was an alternative to Fallout, I’d be on it like a shithouse rat on crack. But Fallout is the only series of its kind, and Bethesda have trapped me in the throes of hatred and passion at the same time. Best idea ever, piss poor execution. Only reason Fallout 3 and 4 are playable is because modders have fixed it for them, and 76 doesn’t have that option. So now we know what the other games would look like if the modders didn’t get to fix it...
---
You on Xbox? If so my names infurnofic1
---
Thanks for the help guys :)
---
I’m tempted to be a terrible raider troll and share 3star Lifegiver on all the bloody builds... 
---
Then stop sharing it.
---
Awesome!
---
It's your choice to not fight back as an owner of a workshop. 
---
People shouldn't have to take the risk of a surprise attack or let their guard down because you chose not to shoot initially. 
---
Sorry friendo workshops are pvp environments and once you've gone red you should fight until either side is dead.
---
It is obvious that your expectations are different than mine. Maybe it really is just that hard to get back into a game that disappointed you before.
---
You will have to forgive my conclusion on your playthrough. It was based on the one sentence you provided for your experience.
---
I still disagree. The wasteland is littered with NPCs providing tid-bits of flavor to full companion questlines. There is a new boss and more events with wastelands. I didn't have the prewastelanders experience but I loved the main quests, all five of them. Overseer tapes, Responders, Overseer tasks, Wayfair treasure, and factions. I have had 640 hours and I am still loving it. I leveled three characters, each a different playstyle and personality. I have met some really great people playing in teams and had some fun conversations into the wee hours of the morning. 
---
I hope you find something here or elsewhere that gives you joy. Cheers!
---
I collect Legendary Rolling Pins....I'm down!
---
Savage Divide, it started near Sunnytop Station (an area I’ve never had problems with).
---
Quite possibly, though I rarely ran into but maybe once or twice.
---
I like that the fletch mod only fires one harpoon, but you can end up looting like 1-4 harpoons back for each shot. It may not be the best heavy weapon, but it's nice knowing that I'll never run out of ammo for it
---
Next I want to change graphics setting and be able to unplug my headphones and switch to speakers without restarting.
---
OK its change max health, carry weight, xp earned, food and drink buffs, movement speed, damage, crit damage and the numbers on the stats page.
---
Hrm true.
---
They coulda just made the ammo converter a special vendor I guess. With 1 .38 being worth 1 of special currency. You can trade with the vendor same way as all vendors. Different Ammos have different amounts. Trade what you want via slide bar. Then buy ammo same way.
---
Yeh.
---
Aren't they all?
---
You must have a lot of free time to complain about this kind of thing
---
&gt; Y’all bitch a LOT about a game that you *still* go back to playing. 
---
People can walk and chew gum at the same time. 
---
They can also complain about things about the game that are poor and the poor work the devs do and still find things to enjoy out of the game.
---
The very unsubtle implication of "if you play the game, quit your bitching" is a recipe for stagnation. 
---
It's the persistent complaints that push Bethesda to do better. Especially the ones that follow up with a cancelled Fallout 1st sub. Those ones have been pretty effective of late.
---
This isn’t future content. It’s already in the game and playable
---
I saw someone post about how they revenge nuked someone's camp hahaha
---
Add a Ms. Nanny to the basement of the Ag Center named Aggie who gives you plant collection challenges (12 Ash Rose, 10 Blight etc) and it has a chance to unlock a new plant for your C.A.M.P. Another idea would be a resource like a greenhouse that grows Strangler Bloom you can unlock from a Dyer Chemical daily quest so Radshield will be easier to create in game.
---
Seriously, I just replaced it with something else (that I liked less but still)
---
Literally every time something happens in the community, there are the people who make posts criticizing Bethesda in the game, then there are you guys who hate it when people complain about the game, and then there's the normal players who aren't either extreme that end up leaving the sub because they can't stand you guys' constant quarreling back and forth. Y'all say the same exact thing every time and never listen to each other. It's like watching my divorced parents argue... I'm so done with this sub.
---
Sucks the suck, don't do pvp if you don't want to fight.
---
The ghost camp budget is a myth and can be easily avoided anyway if you build the ammo machines on platforms. Want them gone? Move your camp then delete the platforms. No camp budget used. Also you're supposed to control them all with one seperate terminal that you build yourself.
---
All in all, definitely worth your time. Maybe not on your main but on a second account. I can crank out 8K 5.56 in about 20 mins, tell me that's not worth it. 🤣 I have the ammo converter pumping out more flamer fuel than I can carry I had to move some over to my mule.
---
The mistake is being in a workshop and not drawing a weapon when someone attacks. But getting them to force close the game is genius. That would make the claim transfer instantly to the new player. Good tip for pvp players matey.
---
Change servers
---
Oh hell no you gunna do something to get wanted I'm coming to get ya and I'm taking anything you dropped to cover the price it took to fast travel to where ever your criminal ass maybe
---
If you're on ps4 and want a full mismatch set I can hook you up or anyone else who's new.  I save all weapon weight reduction pieces I find.  Psn is hottkarls.
---
Oh i'm on Xbox one but thanks for the offer
---
I ...didn't? 
---
I was letting him take it. Would have helped him finish the Event. I usually try to go around to the workshops that need defending.
---
Do NOT give them ideas
---
Yeah, it's pretty messed up. If only developers would stop creating games designed exclusively to take advantage of this? Hmm...
---
I tried that, started on public, switched to private and it still says it. I guess I'll close out and restart the game
---
Or the servers
---
Naturally. Almost everyone who's had 1st for a while is going to have many thousands of every type of scrap.
---
70
---
Their work has been able to stand on its own enough for multiple games since they took over the IP.
---
I get that some people have a hate-on for Bethesda. But your argument has shifted from they aren’t a significant part of the lore, to they aren’t very interesting, to Bethesda is using them because they’re not sure their own content is good enough on its own without using prior assets. 
---
If they aren’t a significant part of the lore, why would Bethesda use them to bolster their new content?
---
If they aren’t interesting, why would Bethesda use them to bolster their new content?
---
Just simply say you don’t like Bethesda and cut out the middle man.
---
I'd assume when you finally get them to show up they will be auto completed. That's what happened to me when I only got 4
---
I mean, they are hiring youtube people to make it look fun and that Ninja turd to promote NW.
---
You should have time to finish it man I hope so atleast
---
Regarding rewards - I do appreciate the complaints - who wants to get a nocturnal switchblade after making the effort to kill the SBQ? (Sad trombone noise here.) But honestly, that's life. Rewards don't always scale with effort.
---
Sometimes you get lucky, sometimes you get screwed. Spend a ton of effort courting a mate who turns out to be "less than ideal," but meet the love of your life entirely by accident. Work your ass off for a deal that turns out to be a pig in a poke but luck into a great opportunity because you met a guy at the bar or on the bike trail. That's how it goes - life is full of 1 star rewards for 3-star SBQs and 3 star rewards for one-shot enemies. At this point, I only marginally care what rewards I get - I am more than happy with my buildout and have a silly collection of 3-star bloodied 90%WR weapons that I keep meaning to use.
---
FWIW, I have not yet received taxidermy plan from the ATLAS rewards.
---
My real complaint: could Bethesda \*please\* fix the Delbert's Chitlins spawn?
---
Ouch. My condolences, then, 10mm anything late game can be a problem. But the .38 and .308 can still be a kind gift.
---
I do know plenty of meatpiles now give you horrible FPS, maybe related.
---
At RadRumble last night I ended up just staring at a wall because the lagg wouldn't let me hit anything lol.
---
Yes for various healing items
---
Bugged
---
Same here. I’m going to try restarting and waiting for a bit after joining the server before I join a group
---
'Whereas a lot of games would charge' is basically just game publisher propaganda at this point. No one is charging a flat fee for well designed content anymore. *Everyone* is lazily going for the season pass to try and extract as much money from whales as possible.
---
Never mistake microtransaction as a selfless sacrifice to allow us more free content. Making money is always the name of the game.
---
96 was never opened. 94 was closed though. As an avid vault raider I remember haha
---
On a side note, how do you start meat week stuff
---
I know you're trying to be all snarky but it keeps them from getting any caps and your junk. It is a good tip if someone vastly over powered comes in attacking you trying to be a badass.
---
Can’t upvote enough
---
Same. PS4, if that matters.
---
You know, I think it might be happening to others too. I saw people in my group leave and instantly rejoin a couple times.
---
MATHS! 🎉
---
Their work has consistently reused old iconography, often in inappropriate ways, since they bought out the IP.
---
They're not very good nor consistent writers over at Bethesda.
---
Also, my arguement has never shifted. They're not a significant part of the lore, Beth needs to get over it.
---
And no, I don't like Bethesda. Not an uncommon sentiment around...*anywhere.*
---
That's not how Bethesda things work
---
Ah yeah the durability has been an issue for a while, I think the added improved repair kits helps with that a lot though.
---
I think TSE shotguns/dragons were the only other meta, with that deleted bloodied took charge. Now the only argument is that junkies is comparable... but it’s just not. That’s a different topic. 
---
I think all prefixes should be buffed except bloodied, and it shouldn’t be nerfed either. (because the player base would die tremendously.) legendarys should feel like legendarys not script.
---
Yeppers 😑 you are correct.
---
I agree that the BoS stuff has been lazy....
---
But the other stuff? Ghouls and Super Mutants? You know where those enemies came from right? And why they would be some of the most common enemies in the wasteland?
---
Or caps? A pretty iconic part of of the fallout aesthetic and more.... No reason to change that. 
---
Change for the sake of change isn't necessary. Some things are worth keeping around.
---
OK. So that worked. 😂
---
Lol.
---
I used to run heavy vats/critical build. Until I luck out on a god tier deathclaw gauntlet. It was on my pistol build. Had my son transfer it to my tank build. GAME CHANGER... bloody, power attack and plus one strength. All my unyielding set has Ultra light for agility points. Fireproof max, armored backpack, max barbarian, max life giver, max action boy. Some of my gear has agility, strength and endurance Legendary stats. Chinese stealth suit for sneak power attacks. Modded vault 76 under armour.Also drop lone wanderer and use tenderizer max instead. One point in perk card swing speed? Can't remember right now...only weakness is anything in the air or poison damage. So I have a bloody 5mm Gatling gun weight reduction. I can use Molotovs for SBQ to get minimum damage required and once she mutates. ( also gives others a chance to get damage) before a running power attack. Took me months of trials to perfect the build.
---
38s I can give cus I get hundreds but the same friend uses 308s
---
I ran in to this problem continuously. I could shoot straight at my feet or a wall and take 0 damage with 3 ranks of fireproof but would instantly drop dead using it in close range. After experimenting with it for a few hours, I found that it will instakill me if I take the explosive damage from the gauss shotgun at the same time as taking ANY damage from enemies. I don’t know if the game is just adding the calculated explosive damage straight to the other type of damage that my character is taking in that moment, but it certainly seems like it. Only solution I found was swapping weapons when anything gets in melee range. I wound up just stashing it because I could no longer stand constantly missing 95% shots in VATS with it.
---
So I should probably open a ticket on this I imagine. My disappeared. It's easy to tell when it's such a vital card.
---
Sorry man. Feels bad. Least it didn't get your weeklies I guess
---
Its a pvp zone and you even get a warning box telling you its a pvp zone to which you have to accept before you can even claim the workshop. So you knew the risk before you started and you did it anyway. You took the risk, failed and now youre upset.
---
Yes more diversity is key to longer success for this game.
---
How has what they’ve used been ‘inappropriate’?  
---
What ‘inconsistencies’ can you cite?
---
And it has shifted. They are part of every Fallout game. The first game’s main quest involves them significantly.  Explain how they *aren’t a significant part of the lore*?
---
Vanguard is actually kind of a terrible choice depending on what your current ER/DR is. There’s a soft cap. I’m at 500/500/95 without any Vanguards- I use a mix of Lifesaving (x2), and enemy-specific (troubleshooters, mutant slayer, etc). Much better bang for your buck.
---
There were many things Bethesda could have made the ammo converter a truly useful item. One that satisfied a player base asking for some way to manage ammo since Beta.
---
Bethesda did none of those things, and instead delivered a product so cumbersome to use, that I would rather literally throw my ammo on the floor than waste time with it.
---
Happened to me and disappeared later.
---
Yeah I get what you mean. Just really wanted those score points.
---
But I figured me giving him all the thumbs ups and walking away several times was enough to assume I probably wouldn't be shooting.
---
Haha good to know! I’m hitting the level up challenge first :)
---
This is where having an alt character can really help.  It at least gives you a way of working around the game's ridiculous timegates, so they don't actually stop you from playing.
---
The 20/200 Bullion limit is pretty ridiculous, especially if you've stored up dozens or hundreds of Treasury Notes.  But not as egregious as the 150 Scrip limit.
---
I have done that a dozen times it dosen't work.
---
And I sadly can't continue the wastlander quest.
---
I just got  back to the game and already can't play it.
---
Thanks for the info. Is the grind easier than completing the completing FO76 season for the 2,000 atoms? I found the previous system very silly. I stopped doing the "wear a clown hat while dancing on a bear, whilst balancing a teacup" crap challenges after my first week. The season challenges I do naturally mostly then whip out the rest in 10 minutes.
---
I don't get why vanguard is so popular but bolstering isn't. 
---
I much prefer bolstering as it makes it much harder to kill you the lower your health goes and you can leverage that low health with Adrenal Reaction and other similar perks. Not as well as Bloodied of course but you have the flexibility to go full health when the situation calls for it.
---
Yeah, I know that. Technically the whole game is a PvP zone. But just because you can attack doesn't mean you have to attack.
---
Thanks for the info
---
Okay so if that is the case how did this prevent that? Doorways can still be double sided after the patch. So if double sided walls is lagging the server couldn't people just use all double sided doorways now to lag the server?
---
The game needs more caps,scripts sink and making every feature time locked is dumb this is a non mobile game stop treating it as one also add more weapons and cut content back you can only have so much fun getting 100 assassins wood leg 1 star from 3 star enemys
---
Never said I was pleased and I have FO 1st myself. Just tired of seeing repetitive posts of people using outdated info to complain about something that was changed by Bethesda right after launch, tis all sir. If that makes me a bad person then so be it...down vote all you like, but it doesn’t change the fact it is the truth sir.
---
The challenge here is to find a location outside of the workshop zone from which you can successfully stage a defend with a sniper rifle.
---
If anyone else shown up, since you are outside of the zone, there is no PvP, and they have to ’help’ complete the defend before they can take the workshop.
---
You both get credit for completing the (defend) event, and the incoming player gets credit for claiming a workshop (if so desired), and you dont get pulled into PvP.
---
win-win.
---
What do you expect? That’s how the high lvl PvP’ers get their fix of bullying lowbies since they can’t kill you in their base for free anymore.
---
Yeah most of the time they are pretty quick. The worst ones are kill 3 legendarys (can be quick depending on what's up) and the kill a 3* creature was a bitch, glad we've only had that one once
---
Thanks it's all good though, it's just kinda funny at this point.
---
Lmao. Pretty much what the game ya come too
---
He's running a VE15 pump but does have adrenal mutation. He also uses my V2590 combat.
---
Don't say this, it will anger the people who call it a second job!
---
Then don't take workshops if you dont want to risk PvP they did nothing wrong, they are just playing the game.
---
Don't you lose access to the tent as well? Or is it just the ability to move it?
---
I hope it gets fixed soon
---
No you misunderstand. You take the workshop and they KNOW they can now get a player kill. 
---
It what they are looking for.
---
Great job making a beautiful flawless game Bethesda!
---
Did a search to see if this problem was out there and sure enough. VATS on my sneak commando will not work ( PS4 ) but works fine on my heavy gunner. It stopped working while I was in a silo’s launch room. Closed app, power off, jumped off a cliff, took a nuke to the forehead... still doesn’t work on my commando
---
Thanks for the info. It's technically not the same but close enough for horseshoes and hand grenades.
---
Bethesda has pulled Super Mutants out of their ass in every game they've been included in. There hasn't been a single excuse for their appearance in the Wasteland that hasn't been utterly contrived. 
---
If you're comfortable enough with them reusing caps just because they're part of the Fallout aesthetic (only in one of the two original games), then they may as well just keep reusing the BoS as well.
---
I will ignore it then, let's hope it disappears for me as well, thank you :).
---
I hope they fix their problems with instancing while tackling the colossal problem. Kinda hope it leads to interesting instanced dungeons/raids. Maybe thats why its been delayed so much, maybe its because the same system theyre fixing for the event is supposed to be used for the upcoming daily ops and/or expeditions. Who knows.
---
Like I said. Today I was running away from the workshop, didn't even want it. Person started shooting me from down the street. It's not necessary. Again, just because you can PvP, doesn't mean you have to. That why you become wanted when you attack someone.
---
Tell that to the guys with magic deathclaw gauntlets that kill her before her mutation takes effect.
---
Same with the chef blood eagle near Berkley springs
---
Beth doesn't really understand the point of Fallout, so reusing thematic elements like the BoS, Enclave, etc has always missed the point.
---
Like the BoS returning to the East Coast as some sort of mutant-fighting-super-army. Oh, don't worry, they're just a 'splinter' faction, which 180's back to their oppressive roots in the next few years.
---
They're just weirdos from the west coast, meant to die out like so many other elements of Fo1. Beth can't let go.
---
I thought death bags didn't drop at events anymore?
---
I guess I don't understand. You still become wanted when yoi attack at a workshop, so why does it matter. Why not just shoot someone in the street?
---
Luckily the Berkeley workshop handles most of them
---
I wish I remembered. u/Toefudo , below, has a pic of it
---
Even if you didnt want it you still enter PvP in a workshop, you cant complain because people arent playing the game the way you want, if they decide to kill you to take it that is their choice either leave the workshop or defend it, crying on reddit is not the solution.
---
I never want Bethesda to put flying enemies in a fallout game.
---
DM me ur GT
---
Dont worry todd revokes it
---
&gt; And since everyone already calls the brotherhood Nazis 
---
I don't think that many people are, if any.
---
This game isn't a democracy. Bethesda provides the content that they want to, whether we ask for it or not.
---
&gt; Please, change my mind because I really want to be on board with new content that comes down from Bethesda. Thanks. 
---
Look, if you're not that into the Brotherhood this much that it's a problem for you, maybe this upcoming expansion just isn't for you. Nothing wrong with that. 
---
Maybe a faction that is more interesting to you but not to other people will show up during the next round of content.
---
But then it wouldn’t be a time sink or inflate the feeling of things to do in the game.
---
Same here also it breaks my armor very fast also anyone else missing vats shots over 90%
---
But you don’t become wanted with a workshop kill. 
---
And you can’t kill a player outside a PvP zone unless they let you. They have to attack back, if they don’t, you can’t kill them.
---
I even went to the Army Camp to try and do it again but the robot Sgt wasn’t having it.
---
I rarely run into bugs in ESO but I think the players running on mounts is the funniest one. That should be kept in the game.
---
Just need to make all bosses do this.
---
Lol, "don't pvp me in a pvp zone"
---
They are PvP zones. If you didn't want to pvp, probably shouldn't take a pvp beacon.
---
It's my party, and I'll cry if I want to.
---
People seem to forget that this IP they love, Fallout wouldn't exist if it weren't for BGS. 
---
If BGS hadn't had the foresight to buy Fallout from interplay as interplay turned into a sinking trash heap, the IP could have very well vanished permanently. 
---
Now I'm not a fan of the BoS. I find them bland and boring. They do however play a notable role in the fallout lore and setting. While I love seeing smaller regional faction's stories, you have to expect the big boys will play a role somewhere.
---
You have to have a healthy mix. I'm not a fan of BoS, but I have no issues with them returning to WV, a place in 76 lore they've already been.
---
It works on treadmills. It's the only way to make your mount work.
---
okk. i have almost 0 xp in PvP.
---
Yeah. Typical for this game. There are a lot more surprises coming your way.
---
Enemy-specific useless imho. My enemies dont have special chance to hit me if they arent other 76’ survivors))
---
As far as I'm aware, the Queen is completely immune to explosive damage and has been for quite a while. Not sure when that changed precisely, but no matter how beast you can get a fat man or grenade launcher they won't even tickle her.
---
I do agree explosives need some serious love, though.
---
Touche
---
But this is what they want!
---
They become wanted , other PVPers hunt them then they can get their PVP fix.
---
Don’t blame the players!
---
When I take a workshop for the challenges.. I’m out of their immediatly ..and never go back
---
Why not?
---
Ah, my bad. Sorry. That's all little I cared about vault 94.
---
Ah, so you’re upset that Bethesda expanding upon the storyline and threw in a twist, and because that contradicts an out-of-context terminal entry, it’s ‘wrong’. 
---
The BoS were in FO2 as well. So your claim they should have ‘died out’ in FO1 is odd.
---
Says 'max weight limit reached' if you try to take them out.
---
Also add a  larger camp stash to fallout first eso gives stash weight with there subs
---
Whoops yeah, forgot about that. I'm not really sure, not a 1st sub but I've seen people answer this a lot. I think the tent is just gone altogether as it is technically a feature, but I'd assume you keep any tent skins you got (for whenever you sub again)
---
Nah, I'm upset that Beth has an infamously poorly organized writing team and a terrible grasp on what made Fallout a gripping universe.
---
Yup. That problem started last week for me. I noticed the higher ranked I get the more glitches are popping up. When I was level 80 everything seemed fine.
---
My camp seems to think my vendors have no power but players still buy from it weird
---
Thank you guys/gals for all your replies and for educating me further about the FO76 market,  it's much appreciated. Don't get me wrong, I'm an old school gamer and i believe in "hard work=Reward". But the Encryptid event feels like playing Russian roulette with a Minigun with 1 empty chamber. :) I'll just keep on truckin' through the Appalachian wasteland searching for my white wale. :)
---
Were you logged in during reset?
---
Did you play NW at all?
---
5 times?  Anything common you did those 5 times?  I get it's frustrating but I was just asking for some info so at least we can work out why it's happening.  Hope this doesn't happen again to you my dude.
---
there is a character item log of 255 items, you need to loot that many items before the "first items" on that list fall off and are able to respawn for that character.   a container, no mater how many items are in it, only counts as 1 item in the list of 255
---
It’s very easy to hit armor soft-cap these days, so out of power armor, I prefer a mix of enemy-specific effects (troubleshooters etc), and lifesaving. But I run an unarmed tank- I’m not trying to be sneaky, I’m in your face ripping out your spine. A sneaky build will probably want Chameleon. 
---
The beautiful thing about a junkies build is with proper armor and/or perks, you hit armor soft cap very easy (hell with a full suit of Buttressed Secret Service you’re over soft-cap) so you can really wear whatever the hell you like. You’re not “forced” into one type due to your build.
---
Regenerating? Sure, why not. Chameleon? If you like to sneak, go for it. Hunter’s? Should help against those sheepsquatch (and I’ve heard Scorchbeasts too!). Troubleshooters? Oh you know how nasty Assaultrons and Gutsies can be. 
---
I run Solar armor so I don’t really need regeneration; I don’t do stealth so I don’t need Chameleon, so I can enhance my tanking with specific defenses and self-revives (lifesaving). 
---
In power armor, as a tank I’d probably take kinetic dynamo torso mod to keep my AP up (keeping Dodgy active!)
---
 Calibrated shocks are almost always a must (100 carry weight is hard to argue with since you can’t get any other carry weight enhancements in PA- No backpacks, no legendary weight reduction).
---
Targeting HUD is my go-to since it makes finding enemies so much easier. 
---
And whatever the reduced power attack arm mod (just one) because all the others are useless.
---
The boss of lucky hole mine and a cultist in the monster room drop fuel as well
---
I want to do something like this but can’t figure it out! How did you get it started? Are there any foundations?
---
Nice junkies set up! I guess it works if you work it :)
---
ninjas? it's worse than I thought
---
No way
---
Give me an example.
---
PS4 seems to be the same day..
---
I only keep it on my camp so low levels passing by from the wayward will see how annoying it is, so they don't make the mistake of building it themselves.
---
It sounds like it happens when the meat piles are piled on top of one another. In a tight area like radiation rumble or Uranium I can see this happening. The Line in the sand is normally very spread out unless it is glitched to group up in the center. Still it sounds like it needs fixing.
---
This is reddit. If there is a will or way that they can be more of a victim the  they currently are. It will be done and encouraged.
---
The entirety of Fallout 3 and 4 would be my example - they're pretty poorly written games, through-and-through. 
---
The cruelly understaffed 76 team seems to have much more respect for the Fallout universe, enough to keep basic consistency in mind.
---
Not opening it. Put it on imgur
---
Yeah, they can still purchase items.  The power only displays you on the map.
---
Has to be a group made from scratch after the daily change. Less thats what me and my peeps had to do last time
---
Hold the exit button
---
Each one is basically a guaranteed atlas provisions box during cloth week.
---
&gt; And in comparison, ESO plays almost flawlessly?
---
ESO is developped by Zenimax while FO76 is developped solely by Bethesda. That's our problem.
---
Its the marine armor helmet
---
It doesn't force you to login. Either you choose to or you don't.
---
You don't have to engage with the content if you don't want to.
---
How hard is it not to do the season run if it bothers you? We shouldn't take away the option for those who do like the seasons.
---
I honestly don’t like fo76 theme I mean it’s good but not as good as previous
---
Edit: not that I care for karma but it’s hard to have a opinion on reddit
---
Exactly. I find them to be fairly lackluster and monotone. But they are integral to the storyline and lore in most of the games. 
---
They had a lot of potential. And to be perfectly honest, Interplay didn’t develop them a lot. Bethesda decided to flesh them out and expand upon them. 
---
Some people view that as ‘a crutch’. But those same people would likely scream foul if Bethesda ignored them and introduced a different faction that essentially mirrors them.
---
Look how much flak was given over the Scorched. They were never mentioned in previous games, how could they possibly exist?
---
Too many members of the audience think they have a controlling vote on where the story goes. That’s the decision of the content creator/owner. 
---
If they want a story to go a certain way, they need to write their own.
---
I have just reached this mission on one character:
---
Putting the fuse in first did not help.  The terminal reports that the sample is not loaded.
---
If FO76 deserves any credit, it totally earned it in its score. The soundtrack is pretty amazing.
---
I’ve got one you can have for 7k , in game tag Gustavo2695 not on for about an hour or so but send me a message and I’ll be in touch
---
Ok
---
It stacks with perks though. 
---
I’ve got 5 pieces. If I equip/remove Bear Arms it changes the weight of my heavy weapons. 
---
My mule is at ~1800ish weight right now. If I take off my armor and all my perks, it’s closer to 18,000 (he’s got a ton of everything- weapons, armor, aid, junk, ammo)
---
Wait, I was in the burrows last week, are they closed after the recent update?
---
Seeing as how this is considered to be the "content" we got from patch 21, I'd say that we are supposed to be doing it.
---
its lazier to make a new mechanic than adjusting some values, isnt it?
---
It only shows a camp symbol not the. Bottle cap one
---
Lucky. I've been trying to roll an Instigating for my Gauss to replace my combat. No luck yet. And yeah, I feel your pain. Definitely a little bit of a learning curve with the shotguns double sometimes triple tapping to get VATs to work.
---
Further. And perks stack with the armor too, at least for weapons (my heavy weapons get lighter when I use Bear Arms, even though I’ve already got 5/5 WWR)
---
When was the last time anything in this game was designed to be just fun? This is console mobile game
---
His music is pretty good. Really like the intro. Kind of gives me a Game of Thrones vibe to it.
---
Yea, something is wrong.  I just hit 50 last week and I am constantly seeing level 60+ enemies
---
Try watago 3 there
---
1 on top of the high school
---
1 by the vetabird crash
---
1 in the travel center in the 3* locked door or 2* hack computer
---
100% agreed but we hold the line here aka running from a scorchbeast level 9 is up there
---
Edit: who downvoted him he's totally right
---
Why do they need to change the currency. 
---
Explain to me one valid, necessary reason, to change such a small thing. Any decent reason to change something that is fairly iconic in gamer culture.
---
If you want an entirely different wasteland game... Go play something else.
---
I picked up a bloodied 3star swing speed the other day and named it *Chef’s Kiss*
---
At one time I agreed with OP.  No longer.  Death needs to have a consequence.  When you die, you loose your junk...it’s not yours any more.  It’s just junk.  You can recover.  In fact, you may even get it back.  Without a consequence there’s no motivation to improve.  
---
I was upset when someone looted my death bag for the ballistic fiber I’d just spent two hours collecting.  I needed that!!   I wanted a revenge system and I posted about it here on Reddit.  Someone convinced me that the better solution was to improve my strategy, to weigh risk and reward.  I’m convinced I’m a better player today for it.  Hope it helps someone else.
---
Bethesda,like Vault Tek Is trying to build a better tomorrow,by making games,that feel like work,so the one young’s are ready to acclimate to the work force once they get there...
---
Eeeep,Lol
---
Is that what this has become?
---
Lmfao
---
Thank you very much for info!
---
Simple solution there is you cant take a workshop with pvp disabled. Most workshops aint worth the time and effort to start with if your actually there for mats. So i doubt most people would care if it gave us a way to turn off pvp completely.
---
Yeah, this is my point, I was just commenting about taking things for the sake of taking things. And I honestly wouldn't bother much about the event. it's not worth that much effort because 1 rewards are meh, 2 other people who have unlimited storage and dupers will most likely take care of it xD last one is a joke ofc but who knows.
---
Sadly, I am beginning to think it is. And clearly, the people here support it.
---
I disagree. The plot lines of those were about as simplistic as the first two games. Go find the lost MacGuffin and learn the secret truth behind the stores. 
---
New Vegas had a fairly unique storyline, but not by much. 
---
I’ve yet to see any inconsistencies in FO3, FO4 or FO76. I’ve seen new information that adds to the story, but not contradictions or lore-breaks.
---
Are you serious?   I can do this?   How long has it been like this?
---
It's a quest reward, doesn't take long to get.
---
&gt; But.. I still play it every day
---
I could understand that if you told me that you're a gambling addict. The whole looting system is as equally bad for me. 
---
Also, the end game is just not there. A boss to kill for things to make your gun shoot special bullets so you can keep grinding to make those special bullets. 
---
I just can't wait for the next boss to get released so I can finally pursue some true endgame goals -&gt; get a rug and a legendary rolling pin.
---
Unbelieveable that there’s still people bitching and moaning over other people playing within the game features of PVP - if you dont like it stay the f away from workshops or pay for private servers... there are options to avoid PVP...
---
Sure, label them as douchebags and rejoyce in your own selfrightiousness...
---
I want a team of mister handy robots to work my farm while I’m away...collect my water, harvest my vegetables, and have some corn soup cooked when I come back to camp....
---
Because the currency was developed from 1 to 2. Caps were never integral to the universe until Beth bought out the IP and wanted some iconography.
---
....huh?
---
I’ve seen some making 10mm and .50 at the same time. Chatting with the player it turns out it will always make 10mm and whatever else you set it to at the same time.
---
Right?
---
Kinda like blaming the dealer for your heroin addiction there, though, isn't it? Lol.
---
Pick up everything, sell everything at the vendor and scrap what you can't sell. Repeat.
---
Yep. I ditched her immediately. Gramps was my go-to but he stopped working so Raider Punk it is.
---
I cannot avoid her in other people's camps though.
---
yes, it generally is a good community, there, of course, are the a\*\*holes who try to kill you, scam you, etc, luckily they are few and far between, except when they are teamed up of course  
---
i am always carrying plans to give away but a lot of people are just on alts, and already have them.  i don't leave in bases anymore because some people log out without returning to their bases, then someone else snags them.  if they ever get the game to at least 95% functional (i estimate 85-90 right now, not counting fixes they did that people dont like for various reasons) it will be a lot better.
---
You could use the flamethrower method to break the floors then place the saucer where it broke then repair it
---
I edited the thing now. So you can click on it. Don’t really know if the quality is the best. Sorry
---
I like it. It is something to do. But some people will complain about anything. I bet if they gave you a chance to click a button and immediately finish the season, youd complain about that too.
---
waaaaa someone who I will never see again in my life has 4 ammo makers in their camp😢😢😢
---
Not as good as fo4 but still good
---
No idea then. I haven't encountered any issues. What platform you on?
---
Yeah just give us that goddamn gun powder, steel and lead
---
I'll try it. Thanks
---
I’ve being doing that for almost two years
---
So literally 90% of the cosmetics for this SEASON are broken, especially the ones that I was excited for. 
---
Neat. 
---
This. This is why we often say that the devs have never played the game they make.
---
I guess you didn't read my full post. I believe we should be given the chance to finish it at our leasure, without worrying about not being able to log in one day, or if you got the auto completion bug.
---
Well, I can't distill over ten years of mad fanboys tearing the games apart to you over a reddit message. There's plenty of video essays on the topic, but let's be real here - you know what I mean, you're just being intellectually dishonest.
---
Stuff like ghoul children that live forever, the reappearance of the BoS and the Enclave, absolutely bizarre setups like vampires and you know - the Institute, a faction that people to this day are still trying to figure out what the hell they're even attempting to do.
---
The Fallout games were landmark CRPGs with a very expansive universe and rock-solid themes that simply aren't present in the newer titles.
---
Trying to undersell them as simplistic is an interesting hill to die on, but you do you booboo.
---
I think it’s more effective simply because you don’t need to keep an eye on what’s coming up behind you when you are focusingon the queen and you don’t get a load or people stood on their tents :)
---
Yeah, society generally considers heroin dealers to be reprehensible, morally bankrupt people.
---
Or yall could stay off tents, stop shooting her in the air, and stay off nearby structures and she will land frequently. My group very often kills her in around 5-6 mins. All you have to do is be patient and she will land.
---
That’s terrible. Did they even check this before allowing anyone to use it? Just add it to the list of things they got lazy on
---
I remember logging in after a several month break and I was at over 3 tons and coild not figure out why took my about an hour to notice the weight change had a few thousand as when we wanted to do runs I would just pre fix them and snag on the go aswell
---
Yeah I usually just stand on the fence by the nuke site lol but with everyone always walking around with broken weapons the fights over in no time these days
---
Do they ever check anything before allowing anyone to use it?
---
or you could just not claim a workshop. Just because you don't agree with something doesn't mean otbers hold a similar mindset. Go to a private server next time.
---
Similar situation here. It seems to me that the game requires certain quests to be done solo.
---
For us it was Gauley Mine. He had the option to enter it solo for his quest or we could enter together and have it not count towards the quest.
---
The contemporary bundle (atom shop item) is pretty neat and comes with intact windows. 
---
Steel building set is also something you might be interested in. 
---
Not 100% sure if the brick set has intact windows.
---
You are correct.  I dont fully read the complain posts.
---
Yet 'revive players' still has no value
---
I think it was just bugged for me, then I got my hopes up for nothing
---
I think the blue steel building set windows are intact
---
If you put nothing on the wall that's facing it (assuming it's the same wallpaper), you can just pretend it's a very realistic mirror.
---
What if we just spam them around workshops?   Will they see that?
---
I mean, sure. Semantically, the primary definition of "gamble" requires a monetary reward.... but yes the secondary definition meets what your saying and people can get addicted to the dopamine of that -- but they can also get addicted to the dopamine of getting ANY reward, whether its good or not, which is the difference with a gacha machine. Gachas (like the purveyor or pokemon cards or magic cards, etc.) always give a reward of some sort. True primary definition gambling doesn't necessarily give any reward/potentially takes things away from you. There's an additional thrill to the risk of actually losing that video game lootboxes/gachas/etc. doesn't provide.
---
Using them wouldn't be so bad if the supply drop didn't take 10+ minutes to drop sometimes
---
It's a visual big just takes time to load
---
You're not wrong. The rewards are so lackluster, it's shocking. For Steel, I probably donated about 4,000. And what do they give for that? Mostly alcohol... 
---
And I'm sure the community will come through with their vast amounts of resources as you mentioned. Even though I have Fallout 1st, certain resources I really don't have more than 1,000 of.
---
I have a feeling this legendary run is going to have the opposite of Bethesda's intended effect. Based on what I've been hearing plus my own experience, there is going to be a huge crash in players after this season ends. People are going to be so burnt out from these challenges they they won't want to log in for next season. I know I don't.
---
I wish the team followed the Firaxis/civ 6 model for releasing content. Regular dev streams. Direct communication. Actual response to feedback. Content that works. You know. Make us feel like we are all a part of the community and this isn't just a nightmare for them.
---
What in fucks name
---
Games weren’t built to entertain for 2K hours, or 3200 like your time in GTA. They’re still constructs by humans. Put some time into a skill or something idk, that’s so much time lol. 83 days of your life gone to FO76 over the past 2 years... 11% of the days. 
---
5% of the days in the past 7 years were spent on GTA. Sheesh.
---
Don’t expect devs to build infinite worlds just because you don’t understand balance with games and real life.
---
Ikr
---
The brick set has intact windows.
---
&gt; but this idea's half-baked :p
---
Who cares? Give us that shit! And an ultracite version so the scorchbeast can pewpew green beams from it's eyes!
---
So?
---
You buy an IP from a dumpster fire. Saving it from going forever dormant....
---
You likely want to retain some flavour from the initial entries....and build off that. 
---
You don't buy an IP and say "Scrap everything. We're making a whole new game" Why would you spend money buying the IP otherwise. 
---
Get over old fallout. Interplay's contribution to Fallout has now been significantly over shadowed by BGS. 
---
BGS put Fallout in front of more people than interplay. BGS has ingrained things from Fallout into gamer culture in a way Interplay ever did. 
---
No BGS. No one would have talked about Fallout anything ever since Interplay burned. 
---
It'd essentially be abandonware.
---
It's because of the strange in numbers perk card.
---
Sure, but not everyone plays a Fallout game with the goal of hitting things with a board. I don't particularly enjoy melee. And seeing as I don't need any of the low level ammo... ehh.
---
Yeah I honestly have no idea how I can still play GTA online in washington. Rockstar must have some serious lawyers keeping that up, not something I imagine Bethesda would invest in 76, considering its likely nowhere near as revenue-producing as GTA.
---
As you can see in the other comments here, people love it too much and wouldn't have fo76 any other way.
---
At this point it feels like a mobile game.
---
Log in.
---
Get points.
---
Log out.
---
It took me about 20 min to do them also.  Now I got nothing to do until 7pm where I will log in again, get my points (about 30 to 45 min that time) and then log out.
---
why is this a fucking skin and not a stand alone weapon is beyond greed
---
ahh yes another enclave fanboy crying about BOS great
---
Surprisingly, the board.  Apply the spiked mod.  Has a great range, and nearly silent for stealth.  Try it for kicks if nothing else.  It works great as a level up weapon.
---
Seems like that's what gamers consider devs to be, even before the age of lootboxes and dopamine points. xD
---
I’ll never forget my first and only bloodied explosive drop. Super Mutant under a bridge in the Mire. 10mm Submachine Gun...The one weapon without any mods. Sigh.
---
Fallout 76: legendary edition
---
I mean, at least let me pet the Brahmin and the animals that I can tame. I totally want a possum.
---
PS4.
---
I had the bug yesterday. Managed to fixed that by turning off all quests in pipboy, relogging, putting t fuse and then using PC. If it doesn’t work try again by server hopping
---
I just use melee cause I like punching things
---
Can confirm I have a mule with about 150+ weapons on it.
---
I just wish Beth could actually write for Fallout.
---
At some point you have to ask what you are playing for. I was the same, playing near enough every day but as soon as I got maybe ten levels into the Legendary Run I've decided to opt out for now and take a break. 
---
I barely did the Challeneges before, so why should I do them now chasing a new XP gain that gets bigger and bigger over time. Ultimately there is no new content for me to do. I'm not handing over materials to the Brotherhood as a way of "content". 
---
If actual new story gets added to the game I will check it out. I play Fallout to roleplay, to experience the world and it's setting. I'm not playing to have another part time job. The rewards offered in the Legendary Run aren't worth the time for me to put in. 
---
In the time since I've actually hopped over to Destiny 2. A game that is very similar to Fallout 76 but one that I feel simply does this much, much better. I have weekly updates. I have plenty of story to experience and play with. And from what I can gather (on Reddit at the very least) D2 has far more interaction and engagement from Community Managers and Devs to the Playerbase.
---
Find another game to play until more gets added to 76. If the game is becoming an addiction for you, it's probably time to step away and have a break.
---
hiding in a bush and doing drugs, it's like a high school simulator
---
Mfers running around with “legacy” or hacked weapons just to kill people and destroy their bases and the bases get nerfed? Do better Beth.
---
Jesus yes. Anything but this. I tried using the new setup for the first time and immediately gave up. Even worse, and I'm betting we don't get a second fix.
---
IM 100% DOWN NO UP THIS IS WHAT WE NEED
---
Hyper realism is what I’m into
---
Then why bother engaging the discussion if you're not even gonna read what the person has to say?
---
If people complaining annoys you, just scroll past it? 🤷
---
Real gamers get their wife and kids on alts to grind for them
---
everyday after school, play a couple hours of a game, do something else, sometimes spend all night on it if i can't sleep, go out regularly, keep up decent grades in school, maintain a serious relationship, maintain many friendships and have plenty of free time away from games to spend time with whoever I want, i have a pretty good balance, this wasn't a post saying hey try to shit on me because you wanna be an asshole to a stranger on the internet, I was saying this game has very little end game content. and thats it.
---
Scrapping weapons from a west-tec run will yield more Steel that from several hours of farming grafton Steel workshop - you dont need the workshop if you want to play efficient...
---
It is when you would have to adjust the price of *every single item in game* then test, retest, simulate an economy with no players, etc etc etc.
---
Thanks! I tried that but it didn't work until I logged off then on. I just want my damn chicken coop!😂
---
the Enclave are traitors, they killed the REAL government to take over. they created the scorched plague and the scorchbeasts, they have usurped the real government.  
---
the brotherhood (east coast under maxim at least) is trying to KILL the monstrosities to save mankind, and trying to save technology for the betterment of mankind.  if the Instituted didn't create synths, they would have been the best option for humanity.
---
God this would be a nice addition, last night I spent 45 minutes converting ammo
---
I'd love NW if it was a standalone game without perk cards
---
Good luck!😊
---
maybe their ideals havent solidified yet, but I could see them being extra aggressive and untrusting since the bombs hit so recently and we 76'ers are a bit of an unknown variable to them, especially with our rampant nukings and mutations
---
we are probably horrifying to them at the moment
---
I just got rid of it from my camp. Too cumbersome to use, talk about poorly thought out.
---
I think Epic calls that version Fortnite
---
Are they intact?  With the large single window you can walk through it
---
Well that bites. My son will not be impressed with that at all. He's grinding the whole thing for basically the cosmos stuff and the hidden fireplace door. I'll hold off on telling him
---
I'm amazed when someone puts thousands of hours into this game. I'd lose my mind from lack of activity alone.
---
I started playing a few months before wastlanders here and there. Since then I've put in a few hundred hours. A couple hours a day a few days a week. I just passed level 50, havent run a silo, launched a nuke. No legendary weapons besides a railway rifle someone dropped at my camp. Playing solo all but 3 days since this last winter.
---
But you know what? It's been a good time, and that's all that matters. I'm too old to brag about artificial things like a 3* arsenal or playing a virtual market. Especially when the end achievement is burnout and exhaustion.
---
Good on you for stepping back, if even for a while. Your well being is more important. I'll go ahead and take my downvotes now.
---
It takes a bit of practice, I find the messenger events a good one to get in the habit of switching as you can as soon as he starts talking when he reaches his destination :-) other ones like line in the sand are pretty dam near impossible to guess
---
We can litteraly take out the entire world again if we wanted to
---
NW wishes it was
---
Where's lost home at?
---
You should be getting downvotes for promoting well-being.
---
Yeah, I realized afterwards that all I needed was weapons plus the Scrapper Perk (not sure why it didn't dawn on me in the first place). Do you have recommendations for concrete?
---
No and no... you have options to avoid pvp
---
I just have free time to play a game and this is a game I very much enjoy and I completely agree, I never thought I could have put in this much time into anything but I checked all my challenges in game and saw i had just about hit 1200 hours, on my ps4 i was just around 650, but I've done everything, there is nothing this game has for me so there isn't a point in playing it, and I've been searching for a different game for weeks so I've decided to put away games for atleast a few weeks, i might get on for an hour or two every once in a while but I won't be playing any game like I have been for the past 2 years
---
I finished half of em in ten minutes
---
If this is what you do for fun, you need to rethink your life. Get a real hobby, or something. 
---
Do you tell people IRL that this is how you entertain yourself? Follow strangers around on the internet and pick arguments? 
---
Seems like it would be simpler to just admit you're a racist and get on with your life. But whatever, see you soon, lol.
---
Missing one. Buy 3 things
---
It would be nice if they had a reinforced shack set. Basically a patched up and clean version of the started shack.
---
Try doing it on a private world worked for me.
---
I was just now transferring about 10 top range lmgs and 50 cals to my mule, had a connection time out, was sent back to the start menu, pressed play, selected private world, and all the stuff was still in the suitcase when my mule loaded in. This happened twice in a row now, it's scary but it works.
---
yes doing it, not going mad for it 
---
even if you don't complete it you should be happy with the content you unlocked as the season is completely free for everyone
---
The grind is similar to the score system, there are daily challenges and a bigger reward for completing them all, there are around 20 challenges but you obviously don’t have to do them all, and some of the daily challenges are stuff like change your hat, visitor x town and eat food, there is a reward for keeping the daily streak going where the amount of gold awarded grows a little Every week, I lasted 68 days until I decided to break it, by then I had around 180 gold bars (they award you about .2 to .5 gold bars per challenge, but the economy is adjusted to that with things costing around 2-20 gold, the most expensive thing been the season pass with 40 gold) and you can make gold doing missions and bounty activities and events.
---
like I said, still kinda grindy but totally doable , as everything it’s definitely a game where new comers enjoy the heck out of but veterans slowly get tired of it
---
Appreciate it. Joining you now.
---
Edit.: she didn't have much, maybe I will try an alt, lol.
---
I'm kind of in the same boat myself. If PC didn't have so many people cheating I wouldn't have any real complaints about the mode.
---
Omw
---
Edit:thanks for the opportunity
---
Yer time is appreciated
---
Wouldn’t you  be happier on Minecraft with a fallout mod
---
yup, hope the brotherhood sees that threat and has the chance to be hostile to us
---
if they are just "the good guys" again, and they help us and let us join for no reason ill be dissapointed
---
Everybody knows already
---
But the way it was, that you want back, required the same engagement of doing meaningless tasks each day to get atoms. You just want free atoms to get stuff. But you don’t want to do the same work to just get free stuff?
---
Huh thought this would go over the build limit, whenever I tried to make a third story on my camps I couldnt even finish the roof, how does it work?
---
south of watoga
---
There is actually a way to make just 1 ammo type by changing the ammo to 10mm then leave terminal and then set to new ammo type . 👍
---
No I get that but not everybody knows that, the game doesn’t tell you and not everyone goes on the subreddit to know these things
---
Is it because there’s little endgame content, or that you’ve exhausted the content beyond reasonable means?  Notice I did not call you a loser, or make any assumptions about success in your  life, I  said that’s a lot of time spent and an imbalance.
---
I’d rather they nerf everything then buff everything. If they buff everything, they’ll have to increase enemies difficulty or the game would be too easy, and if they did that, low levels without legendaries would have a tough time. It’s much easier to just nerf everything
---
Just look for a horde event on the map.
---
Guaranteed 3 star
---
Yesterday someone told us that the dailies take him 8+ hours to complete, every day, so you (we) are doing something wrong :(
---
Nah, I love the lore and setting of fallout. Just thought it a good suggestion for those on here who are feeling a little lost on 76 just now with lack of content. I have logged well over 5000 hours on all Bethesda titles and never heard of wabbajack and fallout 4 enhanced edition so for those looking maybe for something new or maybe not, I thought this post would help a little.
---
I see
---
100 percent fixed. I had died 3 times at the queen, and I was like wtf, Cuz I don't die. I had to redo my mutations a few min before that. Looked at my status and was like wtf. Happen to see your post at the same time, agian was like wtf. And then just unequiped and pit it back on. Stats were then fixed, dropped a nuke and it's been fine. I'll be looking everytime I logged in or change servers now.
---
My plans vendor was ok, but my Meds and ammo was empty this morning. (Xbox)
---
Its all fun and games until you accidentally put all of your 5.56 in it
---
Yes! It can double as a tool to win nw.
---
I agree, the majority of this player base are babies!
---
Thank you, I'm on a PS4 but now I know.
---
I haven't encountered that problem so it might be a glitch? But the window is definitely not broken in the way that shards stick out of the frame and from what screenshots I can check atm it seems to have the reflection flair or whatever the effect is called.
---
I finished the legendary run three days ago. And didn’t but any tiles.  I got the auto complete bug 5 times. There are extra challenges now so no body should miss out on completing it if they put in any effort.
---
Buddy.  The duper’s and exploiter’s have caused Bethesda to do a bunch of negative things to every player.  My game sucks more because of them.  
---
Come use your pvp.  I don’t care.
---
Yeah, I’m gonna probably save up scrip and then try to get it on the super sale, I have enough caps rn to get 2 recall keycard circuit boards
---
They wont give back atom challenges,that was the trap with the legendary run,it was a nice way to make you log in every day while reducing the atoms you could earn with the old system.
---
I think we should be allowed to sell a certain amount like how we can drop stuff using the bar to get the right number (ex 187 .38)
---
From what I’m gathering from the herd consensus is that there should be TRIPLE the amount of repetitive negative posts.  Just completely flood the main page!  You heard em mob!  Start your complaining!
---
much higher spawn rate for the rare vendor than the one at charleston station. also have 2 mag and 2 bobblehead spawns and a rareish plan spawn.
---
They are suppose to add it. Fireplace door is amazing tho. So cool
---
Upvote for a very positive and interesting post
---
Well you’re lucky then cuz it’s super strong lol
---
Great, this sub works as perfectly as this game does.
---
How does it feel being called a racist for literally no reason  other than that's what you do?
---
You need to rethink your life, cunt. You get off on this calling people racists. You fucktards who do this all over reddit honestly need to be banned. 
---
Feels good, doesn't it cunt?
---
Ugh, I get their frustration, but rather wish they hadn't deleted everything.
---
I doubt adjusting the economy would be that simple. A lot of sellable loot is being scrapped, consumed or cooked.
---
It says a lot when a post that makes perfect sense is getting downvoted while a commentary telling you that something better can be found in the atom shop. (nothing against the commenter who was just being helpful!)
---
2 days ago, everyone was about to quit over the building patch and since Bethesda posted their "OnO sowwy" post, it's like nothing happened. 
---
"Ohh they said they're sorry? let's keep throwing them money then!"
---
If it ain’t nailed down just take it and scrap it! Fastest way to get plans and scrap!
---
Brilliant!  This latest update made it worse!
---
Bog town
---
I see your point though. A lot of people are using the same builds, but I don’t blame them. I like making alts with different builds as I recently made a berserker gunslinger. It’s a nice change of pace
---
Same here, I hate the event otherwise so it was real disappointing haha
---
They don't have the you need to be born into the brotherhood metality yet soo heh
---
Welcome to the whitepeng
---
This is not a bug! It is an unintended feature, that we should all be thankful for! I believe for the time being, let us just enjoy it, and not complain and make a big deal of it. Plus, if you are not a FO1st subscriber, why complain if you are participating in it?
---
I could see Bethesda adding missed rewards to the atom shop later.
---
Rare did something similar with the Blighted ship set in Sea of Thieves. Gave everyone an opportunity to unlock a few of the pieces through challenges before adding it to the emporium.
---
I think I read that it’s Wastelanders missions that have dialogue selections in them that are solo-only. This is to prevent the other players just getting stuck standing around not progressing in the story since it’s only the main person talking and engaging with it. Not sure if this is 100% correct though.
---
Berkeley workshop is like all you need
---
What high horse? OP is being an A-hole is all to the developers. You don’t need to have any attitude to see the wrong.
---
I just want a yawn emote.
---
Honestly the level of quality on some mods is off the charts, when you think a lot of the mods are created in spare time for fun. Really gets me pissed that Bethesda can't do more, I think the biggest insult to me is we have no reliable way to play fallout 3/NV on console. A bunch if guys got together and recreated a whole game and Bethesda said NO to using the original voice actors. I think its about time Bethesda started actually hiring these people or do the decent thing and ask obsidian if they have the time to do fallout 5.
---
I've done that twice now. "Oh, a locked safe. Don't mind if I do." In a workshop zone, yellow color. 1st time I was confused. 2nd time I felt stupid for it happening again.
---
Does it give you 100 cloth like the one that even at Morgantown Airport gives you?
---
You said most wont pay for mods.  On PC that's correct but people on consoles have no choice but to pay for mods
---
Almost exactly this. Bethesda games have been the way the ya re for years. We knew what we were getting with a Bethesda game. If the biggest thing they had to worry about was a perk load out mod, the game would be much better because they wouldn’t have to deal with exploiters. But because of toxic community members, we lose features we like and don’t have as much freedom in game as we want. I get tired of people blaming Bethesda when it’s the exploiter community forcing their hands so as not to ruin the game for everyone else.
---
Quite true, but you could still try to make the most out of it: do the silo run to help you earn your daily level up challenge and once ready for launch wait for the individual in question to head to an event, which will hopefully keep him distracted enough to not check the nuke’s target.
---
Fallout 2 was the only game that did that. Even New Vegas used caps. 
---
It’s like you have this fixation on FO2.
---
Could use more condescension.
---
Daily challenge: Pet 0/3 animals. Watch how fast we'd fly into the game.
---
Neither, They screwed something up with this last patch. If it takes forever to find a game promote a teammate to leader and have him redeploy, that usually works for us.
---
Its the height that gets me, with class freak and strange in numbers I can jump over freaking death claws.
---
I don't understand why you're so mad at me, it's really not my fault you're a racist.
---
Yeah I mean I have made a mod list of 150+ mods or so to play with fo4 and Skyrim myself but the fallout 4 enhanced edition pack is just insane. It's got to be over at least 250 mods and they are all so lite. They have managed to get 1k and 2k textures into game that is lighter on GPU than vanilla. The real talent is with the modders that pour soul into games like these. Full props. They have basically made a new game almost. If fallout 5 came out like how this mod did I wouldn't be disappointed. I feel like the situation with Bethesda and it's games is similar to how crisps were invented. 😂 Bethesda might have invented the crisp by accident but everyone around made their own versions that were much better.
---
And, now that the (West Coast) Brotherhood is about to arrive in West Virginia, how about allowing us to donate all of our technical data to them at once (or 10/100 at a time) for bigger and better rewards, so we can properly help fuel their irrational and illogical anti-technology zeal and thus have a small hand in shaping their future.
---
They said they were going to fix it... But when? Mine is still the multiple screens and only holds 2k points
---
Yep. Those Vertibots and Cargobots too!
---
It will probably be given to us on Tuesday when the Atomic Shop updates.
---
The converter couldn't just be a simple mechanic. Bethesda can't do simple.
---
They could earn so much money from selling various different emotes but it’s still an area that they’ve hardly adapted on.
---
Any chance on getting some highlights for those of us who don't have a spare 2.5 hours haha?
---
You don't need auto healing mechanic like the late lifegiver bug or auto stim armor (why the hell would one lower specials by 3?). I never bothered to use life giver bug and i have been doing just fine. Healing factor and diluted stimpaks are enough. It is extremely rare i need to use stims.
---
It's just a rolling pin-pastry-baking pun. Not real criticism.
---
I thought crafting 2mm was the most efficient ammo for ammo converter, right?
---
I've got a feeling that was the plan, but it was too much work for them so they added the shitty terminal on the side.
---
Why else would they add the spin animation to the actual converter?
---
Store or scrap what you can’t fix and then fix the rest at the camp device.
---
Thanks. Yeah I'm hoping it's all cleared up before he's done. I've seen that door at someone's camp, very cool
---
Saucer and Red Rocket Garage both demand to be placed on the ground.  There's a lot of angry posts about it, pleading with BETH to create versions that snap to foundations.
---
This is pretty much their only use. I'd put them in a "care-package" drop or trade for new players. They'll at least get some use out of them. They're so abundant I'm sure you could give them away constantly and still have a large stash left if they do for some reason acquire late-game value, though I doubt they ever will.
---
A good re-work for them would be crafting higher-tier requisitions out of 10 or so, call it a "research requisition" or something. Have the requisition be of such value that it attracts high-level enemies to the drop point,  and the package could contain some rarer items. Nothing crazy like 3* legendaries, but a mix of rarer chems like x-cell, super stims or rare crafting materials, maybe plans, treasuary notes etc etc. It would be a little more worthwhile with little effort from the devs.
---
naw. it just makes picking up all the loot at the end of line in the sand almost impossible.
---
You'll find something, I'm sure. :) But dont be surprised if it feels a bit odd moving on. Change is change. Even the good ones.
---
It supposed to be a peep sight. At least the put the glow on the front sight post and not at all like the m16 I  fonv. I actually like it ngl.
---
Oh man...  Why didnt they do this in the First place...
---
Perhaps you could explain that to my black fiance. 
---
Fucktards like you have made all the current strife a thousand times worse than it is because you use "your racist" like it was a greeting. And the people who do this are truly the racists. I would be anything you have a swastica tattoo. YOu come across as the biggest fucking hypocrite I've ever encountered on reddit.
---
Looking forward to your predictable cliched response here, nazi cunt.
---
Ahh I see. Well I’ll make sure I don’t rush through the game so I can enjoy as long as possible lol
---
I've built double walls just today. Some just naturally and one I had to flamethrower it, but it's still possible.
---
Idk about 20 minutes, but yeah it really doesn't take that long most of the time if you know the map. For events I usually just workshop defend. Legendary enemies x3? The event that has you kill 3 low level wolves or just spend some time at the cranberry bog. Hack a computer? That lighthouse near the beginning of the map. Kill a deathclaw? That bunker on the right side of the map has 3 or the cave near redrocket workshop on the top right of the map has 1. Wendigo? That town with all the feral ghouls in the ash heap has 1 usually.
---
I spend most of my time just shopping tbh. I try not to buy 3 ammo unless I'm pinching for time. I try to find 3 cheap plans I don't know, bobblehead, magazine, etc.
---
I got rid of her fast. 
---
Beckett is the ally now. He’s cool, shoots at critters who come to the camp and seems to have a larger set of lines. Thanks me for giving him a place and thinks my camp is cool. You’re alright, Beckett.
---
Oh, I totally missed it, sorry! I thought you were referring to Ark since saddles are used to ride pretty much any tamable thing in the game ... I'm dumb. :x (which is why I mentionned the ultracie saddle since there's tek-saddles in Ark that gives extra firing power to your dinos like laser beams and stuff ... everything the 90's kids wanted, pretty much)
---
When they announced the skyrim dlc they mentioned how that was something they coulda fixed years ago but decided not to since its such a classic thing now
---
Truth. It’s always been this way and it might even be Bird Bones causing that landing animation and not Marsupial. I’ve never tested this.
---
(So you know, the scrap box and its contents don't vanish or cram into your stash. They stay and are still weightless, you just can't add to it)
---
They introduced a bug with ash piles last patch, they drive my system into a slide show, have to fast travel away. Radiation Rumble earlier no one was using tesla or other energy gun, massive amounts of normal meat piles, no lag... sweet.
---
Yeah, pretty much.
---
Try it with a jet pack!
---
Ah i see. I just don’t get why they couldn’t use a regular ghost ring imo
---
3 points I feel really isn't that much of a sacrifice to me. I just feel safer knowing I have that lil extra survivability.. because man do I need it lol
---
But- 
---
I’m sorry but can you use your eyes and look at the black circle
---
Scrap plants and replace for free.
---
Small bounties are a pain.
---
If I get a bounty, I take off all my outer armor to prevent wear(unless it limits my mobility too much) and indicate that I'm almost defenseless.  I'll find the closest player I can and finger-gun emote at them.
---
If I see somebody else with a bounty, I track them down and finger-gun emote at them.  If they stick around instead of running away, I clear their bounty and dance around their loot until they get back to claim it.  Or pick it up and drop it for them if another player comes along.
---
Although it was crappy, I was just getting use to the old version of the ammo converter. After the recent change, I honestly don't understand how it is supposed to work and simply can't use it. It makes even less sense now. Why is it so hard for them to get this right?!?  I've simply given up now and scrapped it. I'll just go back to dumping unused ammo in train stations.
---
Autostim and bloodied don't belong in the same build. You might want to use a piece of lifesaving armour instead.
---
I hope they add new content for you guys. Thanks for sharing.
---
It's only about a half-hour long and I timestamped the start of it.  They cover quite a lot.
---
Why even do the challenges if you don't even play the game?
---
I'll give it a shot thanks
---
I placed it on the 3rd. So...maybe?
---
Ty
---
Gotcha, thank you!
---
Never going to happen, this encourages/forces people to farm and grind thus login more... maybe, the games M.O.
---
so it sounds like fire proof is working?  Because I never saw any reduced damage when using my JE combat shot gun
---
Collosal Problem is a latest and toughest boss in game.
---
Bloodied is the most damaging weapon prefix and the best you can get.
---
If you don't want to use the best setup to combat the hardest boss in game then it is your own choice. Not a "balacing issue". Stop your fucking whining about bloodied already. There will always be one weapon/build that is the best, and everyone who want to do max damage will use them. Your bitching and moaning will not change that.
---
that is not nice :)
---
Remmember when sentinel, cavlier and assassins was 100% instead of 75%? Pepperidge farm remembers
---
After only 40? You got super lucky man haha. I've gotten 1 to drop in my countless queen's. In the several hundred mark after playing for 1.1k hours haha
---
Edit, it's worth a fair amount over on the market reddit
---
If you didn’t allready use the plan. You could try one of the trading groups. I’m not sure how rare it is or if you just got hit with bad Rng but i see the calibrated shock plans occasionally asked for on trade groups. Might be able to at the very least get some caps or something out of it
---
Other builds are viable, but using them will make your fights last longer. There will always be the best of the best and people will use them. Bitching and moaning about bloodied will not change that.
---
Yeah, this storm was much worse than they originally thought.
---
I would imagine at the moment they would only accept ex-military that would join with them 
---
Elder Maxam blames the apocalypse on the corrupt ways of mankind, i dont think he would just accept anyonw
---
they would be fine with civilians and settlers, but even in their early days I don't see them being friendly with any other people and factions that have their own power, which we definately have
---
I feel like 76'ers in a way are what the brotherhood of steel were founded to prevent from existing
---
their whole shtick is keeping manking from destroying itself, and again, we are insane nuke crazy vault dwellers lol
---
Been playing since BETA. Granted I don’t launch for the queen every day. But maybe once a week or so. 
---
Today I decided to launch 3 in a row since a lot of people were joining events and all. Worked out for me!
---
The BOS collection and the free stuff
---
Caps are meaningless at this point. I’m always at max caps. And whenever I do spend some it just takes me 2-3 days to get back up. 
---
I haven’t used the plan yet since I had to go to work. But maybe I’ll see if I can trade it for something else.
---
I mean, if nothing else you've discovered a new area to explore, that's always awesome. Is it working for you after a hard reset and whatnot?
---
For starters, this build only has 4 foundations, which take up a ton of space. I also never use turrets or other defenses. And I make the ceilings on each level higher. Lastly, I use the environment to add character, but also to save on build budget. Here is a good example of what I'm talking about.
---
https://youtu.be/KynhKNkm8N4
---
This is the way. If you do autostim you’ll be out of stims tomorrow. A lifesaver would be better.
---
I ‘member.
---
Once a week buy gold from Smiley at the Wayward. 
---
Daily quests to earn Treasury notes. You can only cash in a maximum of 20 treasury notes a day (200 gold bullion). Unlock gold bullion in the legendary run
---
Did the steel quota get met?
---
There's really no quick way. As long as you're doing the 3 reputation quests every day as well as enough public events to make sure you can turn in the max of 20 notes per day and buy from Smiley every week there's nothing else to do.
---
It did
---
Thanks... I must have missed that text.
---
Healing factor only heals you after combat ends. But if/when you take damage with bloodied build, it will most likely not be enough to kill you (especially with Bloodied PA Heavy or Stealth Commando). In such case if you absolutely need to heal, diluted stimpak is enough.
---
Maxson blames the politicians, not the people.
---
You can definitely get a pretty decent trade for it. I'm pretty active on the marketplace haha
---
Sweet, omw to drop off concrete
---
I'm not big on watching streams, but I know companies pay attention to them.  Is there a big following for their game on twitch?
---
Sort of like completing certain challenges just feel the same. Individual rewards are kind of off too like I remember killing my first scorch beast at a level 45. And some of the loot randomized aside from food craft were respectively level 45. Now at level 80 nothing seems to reward higher than level 50. And its usualy the same stuff. Even for individual rewards like Id complete an event hoping for caps and that event which normally turns 75 caps turns 20 caps and 6 bars of soap.
---
Nah haven’t fucked with that, level 73 been playing for a month or so.
---
don't buy the helmet or jetpack. Yet
---
It’s making me more likely to just dump my ‘rarer’ ammo on the ground because I don’t want to wait until I have 3 mini nukes or 4 missiles. That shit takes up too much weight!
---
Literally just dropped 15k caps for it and I feel like that was a deal.
---
Dinosaurs with freakin' laser beams does sound fun :D
---
↑↑↓↓←→←→BA on the title screen will unlock 9999 Gold Bullion for whichever character you have selected.
---
Cool
---
yea and again I think he would plau nice with any settlers or small civilizations 
---
but anyone wielding a similar ampunt of power as those politicians? i think he would want to stop immediatelt
---
Same. Hoarding all mats since beta and barely use. I'm sure I can spare some.
---
The fact you need a specific amount to convert is frustrating. If it asks me for 250 .38 ammo and I have 345 or something just let me convert all. It'd be far easier to just allow a slider for how much to convert at least. Terminal menus always feel slow as sin and having to repeat each time to sell whatever the max amount the converter decides is so tedious.
---
Not really what I am comparing, but 5 lead and 15 steel gets you 30 2mmEC, which is worth 138 ammo points. .50 costs 3.5 each so you could buy about 40 .50 for that.
---
Straight crafting .50 is 10 lead, 40 steel, AND 12 gunpowder but you get 200 rounds.
---
I'd say to straight craft .50 you'd be better off just crafting it!
---
I like to have a purpose. The challenges and daily limits are that now because there are no more quests to do. There is no new area. No new events. This shouldn't be the main attraction of the game right now but it is because of the Bethesdas ineptitude
---
I did this just because or the stupid camp build limit.
---
That would make it easy on us and you know that’s not Bethesda’s aim 😂
---
Love it!
---
Lucky, I done the SBG 100+ times trying to get that plan then finally I got it by swapping a junkies explosive combat shotgun for it
---
If only they could hire DeeZire to work his magic.
---
But OP's idea is a lot better than Bethesda's. I don't care how many cosmetic items Beth releases in the store as long as they keep the game alive and with new content.
---
Just as a possible data point for you:
---
I have an AA fixer.  Probably an event reward or looted from a legendary, as I didn’t have the plan at the time I got it.
---
I’m a melee build With rifles as a secondary, (13 per points, mostly rifle related)  
---
Unaltered by foods chems, etc, Hip firing said fixer at a L40 mole miner does about 85-90 dmg.  Typical.  Crouch and use the scope/sneak attack, It hit for over 450 dmg.
---
On PS4, I did run across the plan in someone’s vendor a week or so ago.  They were asking 15k.
---
Do you think this also applies to the type of weapon? That is, maybe some servers give more rolling pins than others?
---
It barely takes any budget which is really bizarre.
---
Thanks for posting. Interesting watch.
---
It also unlocks Championship Mode 🤔
---
Just about the same here. Been hoarding concrete for donuts, my sweet tooth issue finally paid off!!
---
Is there a cap on ammo points? Cause I could see just offloading missiles, mini nukes etc before logging off for the day. Then cash them out at the end of the week or something
---
As it is, it's not worth the time to use. I work for a living. I want to have fun when I have free time. Your idea is beautiful.
---
I started with two foundations. Built a staircase (the big one, with the posts) and the made two more posts. Stacked them anywhere in the stairs. I then remove the post that is touching the staircase, which should leave one floating. You can now stack a staircase on top of another staircase. Once you have stacked them as high as you want them to go, you can remove the lower staircases, which cause the structure to float.
---
We are asking to make it more user friendly. The conversion rate is fine, the UI is just annoying. It doesn't affect your vendor sales in any way by adjusting it.
---
I traded mine for a B2525 Fixer.
---
It would still drop a 1 Star assassins rolling pin
---
For an end game player, I'd say it gives you something to do.
---
^^^ha ^^^ha
---
Wonder how many people will actually try this? 😂🤣😂🤦
---
Damn never thought of that
---
There is no magical quick way to get them. You need to farm treasure notes for gold bullion and buy the plans for the SS armors (and mods). And then use your scrip to buy legendary modules so you can craft the SS pieces. It is a very long process. Especially if you want full set of some specific armor prefix (like vanguards, unyielding etc).
---
You can get 200 gold bullion each day (for that 200 you need 20 treasure notes from public events and daily factions quest). And also once a week you can buy 300 gold bullion for 6000 caps from Wayward (the bar at the start of the game).
---
You can get 150 scrip each day from scripping unwanted legendary items at train stations. And you get additional scrip (small amounts) for doing daily quests.
---
See I just went to the purveyor and bought 20 2 star legendaries, I got 19 flamers, now I have over 1.5  thousand fuel. Both shit and amazing luck as I dont use heavyset
---
How do you claim the community rewards?
---
How is there not a laughing emote? I want one for when people trying to grief.
---
I have these army graduation papers so i think i'll be good
---
when this post shows more than 5 minutes ago i will be gone
---
Like the raiders
---
The helmet should be last right as the only thing it does is have a light?
---
Dang, that is crazy, thank you! I had no idea unyielding stacked, and I don't know what legendary modules even are, but I'm gettingthe sense you can somehow roll legendary effects with them. I will have to Google that!
---
Chain? Chain! Chain!
---
They come out the 11th?
---
Because I thought it was a bug, obviously. If the people above hadn't said it was related to FO1st then I'd have no idea what you meant by 'why complain...' I had no idea that I was 'participating in' something so you're not going to pin the hypocrite label on me so easily.
---
Just hold tab or whatever the back button is on Xbox/PS4
---
Day 2: I’ve officially accepted my fate.
---
Chain...
---
Lol, why didn't you just log out quick before the nuke hit?
---
Yea it's great. I miss having it, since I've switched to a bloodied build and haven't found any unyielding with this effect yet.
---
Omg where can I watch that specific clip?
---
Never thought about it like that, I havnt bothered checking out many more titles, is there any you could recommend
---
Heart of the swamp. FML. Couple legendaries show up. Kill them and they drop UNDER THE DAMN WATER!!!! UI shows collect or drink. Thanks Beth. Great work.
---
No way at all
---
I understand that, but what's the point of even playing the game to earn the rewards if you don't play the game otherwise and don't experience them.
---
Chain
---
The first time I used it I made the mistake of using the screen option to give other ammo types. 
---
That meant I have to go back through every option I clicked on for everything when I'm done to get off the terminal.
---
Now I go back after every ammo I convert
---
the best comment! i feel same way
---
Not me..... 🤥
---
Yes and no. 99% of their drops are crap, basically just shitty weapons, pre-war money, a bit of (probably) useless ammo. They do have an extremely small chance to drop a unique baseball ball bat variant however. So if you’re interested in collecting then yes, they have a bit of use for endgame players.
---
Ah ok, thanks.
---
they may be obtained by opening those BOS crates in the currently live event.
---
they were also a possible reward for the christmas gifts and the mole miner pails.
---
outside those boxes, sturdy and heavy metal armor plans may be rewarded by events in the savage divide and the manhunt event by grafton dam. 
---
or of course, player vendings. good luck, m8.
---
Will cost a few caps but just move the camp and back again. It sucks cap wise, or if you had something hard to move, but what are we really talking, having to sell a couple items to make it back. This is the exact reason I rebuilt my camp to easily place it again.
---
Chain! Chain? Chain! Chain!
---
For modded community, I can only now recommend using wabbajack with oblivion, Morrowind and  Skyrim or fallout 3 and 4. As for other good Bethesda titles I would recommend rage 1 and 2. They are pretty short but good games to play through. Only Bethesda game I wouldn't play would be bulletstorm which should have been a gaming abortion. 😂
---
no idea. despite having 4600 bullion i don't want to spend it on the helmet =0
---
You can drop it in the script machine at most train stations and that’s about it.
---
Well I’ve been waiting to break out the chainsaw again so chop chop
---
Nope. You can turn it into scrip. That’s as close a reroll mech as we get.
---
Don't you smack talk Fasnact collectron!
---
Cool, I've got a bunch and won't be moving my base. Off I go.
---
It always happens
---
It wouldn’t change difficulty considering all prefixes could get a buff and still do less damage than bloodied, just adds diversity. 
---
Bethesda has also stated they will be changing the enemy levels to match player levels. So if I’m hitting a super mutant it’s lvl 68. And a level one can hit that same mutant but it will be level 5 for him
---
Not directly. But you can turn in your unwanted legendary items for scrip at train stations (one armed bandit looking machines), and then use those scrips (when you have collected enough) to roll a random armor piece or weapon (you can choose to roll either 1, 2 or 3 star item, each costing more and more scrip) at [Purveyor](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Purveyor_Murmrgh). For example when you have collected 100 scrip you can try your luck at purveyor and roll a random 3 star legendary weapon. It can be good or bad, depending on your luck (not the luck special stat but your own luck xD).
---
The items you roll at purveyor are rolled to you level, so it would be best to roll only after you hit level 50 as then you will only get max level items.
---
I go with the puke emote for this
---
Yes, i've encountered that players are often talking in public events, but all of a sudden their voices get muted and the mic icons still appear at the bottom right corner as "muted" when they are talking. This has happened twice since last update, no idea if it happened before that.
---
Nerfs are necessary to combat power creep. Everything shouldn't be one shotted in a game like this.
---
No, you can't re roll Legendary items, and also there is no Legendary Blunderbuss. It must be a Blackpowder pistol or rifle.
---
Oh awesome, thank you! I turned in all like 3k steel I had on me yesterday and got nothing but floater grenades, beer and a few caps. I'll continue hitting the event though. 
---
Can you explain the mole miner pails and Christmas gifts? I'm not quite sure what those are. 
---
Also, Manhunt is one of my favorite events. I'll be hitting it more often it seems lol
---
We WISH we could reroll legendaries... especially when one gets a 2* rolling pin as a drop from the SBQ event! 🙄
---
Agreed.
---
Yes this. Just such a hassle to go back and get my eight waters (4 small purifiers) every couple of mins
---
Since all options appear whether or not you have enough to sell, I keep having to leave the machine to see my current ammo amounts and then log back into the machine. Having the buy and sell on the same page has also cause some accidental purchases.
---
Hey!  Be nice...  I’m definitely not specifically an Enclave fanboy. I’ve been with the franchise since the very beginning (I’m old) and I personally find the Brotherhood boring.
---
As a *crafting table* would have been best, like the madre vending machines
---
you can have the jetpack and dense on if im not mistaken
---
Got changed to the 10th apparently
---
Can't say I blame ya.
---
First off good person of the internet, my post was intended to be more so a light hearted joke about the event. I was in no way and shape implying that you are a hypocrite; however, as I look your image within this post and how quick you are becoming upset at the implications of being one... I cannot not help but feel that you feel that you are... But... Hey... I could be projecting...
---
All I am saying is, if you feel strongly that this “unintended feature” due to FO1st, is “game breaking”, why participate in it? Seems a bit odd to bring up this issue of a bug if you participate in it, and it does not negatively or maliciously affect your gameplay experience.
---
Thank you I’ll be sure ti try this
---
Or downvote me for nothing that's fine
---
no they take the same slot
---
I wonder if it would be good to hoard some of those packages, since in the past the loot tables have changed for similar items.  
---
Or if this new format is designed to make them undesirable to hold onto past the events conclusion.
---
If this was for me I apologize. I wasn't trying to be condescending to anyone. If it wasn't for me please disregard. I get a little lost in these comment sections. Have a good one!
---
nothing will ever replace my dense mod it's just too good
---
Soundtrack is amazing. Theres some ambient music while you're roaming around that I can never find when I look through the soundtrack, would love to find it.
---
\*scrip (i just had to)
---
Which is exactly why I only play when I'm actively working towards something even if there's no real point in doing so. It's kind of like monster hunter except there isn't a bigger and more bad ass monster to get gear for
---
I love this so much and I want to try it. I hate myself because I refuse to give up my lead pit squat.
---
Awesome good to know!
---
Honestly I believe it would be best to be like venders. I mean caps, script, treasure notes and gold bullion trade menus never get complained about because their fast and simple.
---
Interesting locations is a pretty common video type. 
---
A youtuber named decoys dungeon did so many of them he started running out of locations. 
---
That being said, it doesn't mean that if you have solid presence and personality it couldn't work. Especially if you added to the base premise and offered building suggestions. 
---
You could also do a variation. Like you each pick an interesting location for the other person, you both build camps and do like a "who built it best" situation, and try to engage your viewers to comment and vote.
---
There are some at top of the world you can disarm.
---
Just a massive amount of stims and the letter h
---
They nerfed explosives *that* much? Christ, I had no idea. Explains a lot. 100% to 20% is like chopping off your arm to remove a watch.
---
Nope. Both use miscellaneous slot.
---
ME! Bought it. Used it for 5 minutes. Took it off and slapped biocommmesh back on.
---
So I ripped settlers and raiders off and grinding and bought chest arms and jet pack first. Hurried to and crafted it on a vanguard I rolled first roll. It was during faschnat and I kept dying while flying so I traded it in after I rolled unyielding on the arms and chest piece on the second roll for each. I went and bought the deep pocketed for the chest being I built my character to carry as much as he can which was 600. But after I got combat bloodied 2 star from a legendary I wanted to switch my build to stealth. The purveyors sweet ass rolled me 3 bloodied weapons in a row and one was a bloodied fixer. Not 2525 tho but I said it’s time. I had 90 level ups saved and switched my build. I only had 4 agility before and now have 13. So I gave the jet pack a whirl again on my unyielding piece. So to answer, at first I regretted paying 2000 for it being I didn’t like it and never used it. But now I enjoy it. But still wish it was cheaper. I mean I’m also glad there’s a glitch that you can put jet pack on t65 without buying the plan. Because I would’ve not spent another 2k on another jet pack plan.
---
Ive seen his videos but our interesting locations werent CAMP ones. We just covered small locations like Sals Grinders and more well lnown ones like The Giant Teapot. We just give its lore, the loot and explore it
---
With cherry picking and confirmation bias, you can always see what you want to see in everything.  
---
So... just don't overlook everything, and try to not stick to what other people think, you will enjoy things much more (not only this game)
---
You’re forgive. I’m sure I make that mistake every single time.
---
Love my little chicken coop. Waiting till the rail collecter goes on sale to add to my farm.
---
oop, thanks man! edited
---
I think this patch fucking caused my legendary ghillie combat armor to disappear! I just loaded onto the world and my armor -that was equipped- is now gone! Vanished! What the hell!?
---
It just works, right Todd?!
---
Nah dude, they're scrimps, kinda like prawns
---
I use explosive weapons most of the time and i use jetpack. You just have to get used to not shooting stuff that are hugging you. If you are surrounded just jump up in the air and blast away. I personally consider jetpack way better option, if you can teach yourself not to commit suicide all the time. Also.. Why not have both? Have two different chest pieces, one with dense, one with jetpack. Then just keybind them for easy / instant change. I used this method at start but found myself sticking to jetpack more and more so dumped the dense one.
---
I have a bloody stealth/rifle build so I can't give you a specific answer about the AP management. 
---
However, one thing you should know about the jetpack is that it won't save you from fall damages. Quite the opposite, actually. I also have marsupial and bird bones and when I'm jumping then repeatedly pressing the space bar to "fly" on a long distance, I often take deadly fall damages despite not being higher than the height of a marsupial jump. It's hard to explain but I think the fall damages are calculated depending on the time you spent off the ground, not on the height at which you started falling.
---
If you jump off a cliff and use the jetpack at the last moment, you will die anyway. (unless that luck perk saves your ass *yet again*)
---
Aside of that, it is quite fun and the extra mobility you get from it is pretty huge. I like it so much that I devoted 2 agi points to the goat legs perk just so I could spam it more often without (almost) any risk of dying.
---
Please assume the position.
---
i agree. sucks having to remember to drop them.
---
the downside is silo runs will become even easier.
---
get the keycard, hack the reactor, blow up the mainframes, replace the mainframes, defend the launch bots.
---
Maybe i'll stock up on them and try for sub 10 minutes.
---
The limit is 2000 points I believe. So your plan would depend on how many nukes and missiles you cash out per day, but I usually fill up on points roughly once a week.
---
Are you using serendipity? That with lifesaving armour will get you out of most bad situations.
---
Are you sure about that? Can you provide a link to this info? Because in my experience, on a private server and public, it was timed and not by any character item log... because there have been many times that I don't loot and just sit at my camp. But after a certain length of time, I would go find those lovely hanging carcasses of deer to loot again.
---
Unpopular but I don’t want the ammo
---
Machine to be easy to use. And I run 50 cal heavy so I always need ammo. I make my money from selling .45 and .308 I feel like making the converter too easy will nuke that part of player vending
---
I don't really get that line
---
My first visit to the purveryor I got 8 assassin harpoon guns and 1 medic harpoon gun. And 1 nocturnal handmade. I didnt mess with it again for like 6 months
---
:D
---
Yes! Just like it was in New Vegas. Maybe a bit more simplier for the newbies though.
---
&gt;Which is exactly why I only play when I'm actively working towards something even if there's no real point in doing so.
---
Life in a nutshell
---
No one told Bethesda Austin that so shortly after a nuclear war that brand new pristine stuff wouldn't exist... Due to all the damage such a war would do :P
---
Ok thanks
---
I've been thinking for a while about that. Power Armor skins need to be split into two categories, "Shape" and "Paint". You would get to apply one of each.
---
It would add a lot to the customization aspect of Power Armor, since we don't get legendary effects or backpacks we need something cool at least.
---
Black powder rifle it is :)
---
Check out the cushioned leg mods for armor.... Since SS armor is missing AP refresh leg mods, I use that, and might have a fall damage legendary too.
---
So subs are a type of sandwich, right? Well in Pennsylvania people call them hoagies. In New England people call them grinders. In New York people call them heroes. I think it's hilarious because those areas are all rivals when it comes to sports and stuff.
---
See I got bullet storm free from PS+ and I kinda loved it, I love cheesy arcade a games like that though. To me at least fallouts combat systems have always felt more arcade like. I do give Bethesda credit on the way they integrated V.A.T.S  into real world time, apart from gun-fu I have found the system to be a brilliant design, just wish they would put all there great ideas onto a new game engine.
---
It sounds like they have a lot of exciting things in the works. Thanks for sharing.
---
Haha trust me, I've mastered the jump and shoot technique. I definitely do think that the dense mod would be a huge QoL improvement for events like Scorched Earth, Uranium Fever, Rad Rumble and Project Paradise where I find myself constantly jumping to get shots off. I currently have 2 Secret Service UNY Chests so I suppose I could do the ol' swaparoo but maybe prioritize the dense first?
---
I'm so excited!😊
---
I added you, look for a FR you haven't accepted
---
I’ve actually been saved quite a bit with my jet pack.
---
They tried repurpousing an existing interface to speed up the development process. 
---
The item they sourced from is the SMART vending machine inside Watoga High School. Its used in tandem with the only PvP based event Monster Mash.
---
I understood that part. Doesn't explain the ravioli
---
Heh it's on my "to get" list. I've only unlocked the torso and the left arm of the SS armor so far. :x Was hard to save up the 2k bullions but it was totally worth the wait!
---
Lol of course it's capped, fair enough thx man
---
Click...wait....click....wait....click....wait....click....wait...click...wait... F*CK now how do I exit this trap!?
---
Some people are emotionally/psychologically stunted and just want to be dicks!
---
Probably his PC. Sounds like a needs to get an SSD issue
---
Nevermind I found it, it's called The Savage Divide on the soundtrack.
---
Because if it's available for you, the game's on Xbox gamepass.
---
I'd suggest trying that out and test out the game, see if it's worth the price.
---
the gifts and pails were part of past events. 
---
both will return, the christmas one well, during christmas. 
---
the treasure hunt one, the one with mole miner pails was a timed event that bethesda said would come and go, but we only had one iteration of it. but both items, the gifts and the pails were heavily duped, so chances you finding one those plans in peoples vendings machines is high. :)
---
I feel like it's a joke to offend everyone lol. That's at least my interpretation of it
---
or even like the legendary script machine works only able to buy other ammo back too
---
I am using it yes
---
Imagine the whole season auto completing lol
---
Monthly, the same day each month that you purchased it on.
---
You sure it was your jet pack? I did some testing as soon as I was able to use it and the fall damage mechanic acted really weird with it. I was sure I could just use it to jump from any height I desired without any risk of dying but it's definitely not the case.
---
Never tried that event and now I dont think I want to
---
I freaking HATE the ammo converter now! It was annoying at first, but now they changed it and instead of improving it, made it 10 times worse. Bethesda must be smoking that good good
---
im on pc
---
What part of 'I thought it was a bug' are you incapable of understanding? You are implying that I'm not happy about players forcing the scorched to spawn in the middle while benefiting from it are you not? That is hypocrisy, ergo I felt you were calling me out for what you saw as my hypocrisy.
---
So just to make this absolutely clear. At the time I created this post I was unaware that the scorched all spawning here was seen as a good thing. I just thought it was a particularly interesting example of a previously unseen bug.
---
High intelligence and a hell of a lot of xp grinding will get you there. Exploits will too though I don't believe at this point people are doing that.
---
Ether way, I'm a level 80 on the battle pass which is around a 1/3 of the last part on the board. Kinda implies the OP played the game a lot more than we have.
---
Angry turtle has a video on respawns of mobs and items, odds are what happened was another player entered the cell and the items respawned off that players list
---
I’m pretty sure, I’ve messed a bit around with how it works for m atleast
---
Exactly. Should have just been an upgrade to the tinker bench. Scrap old ammo in exchange for new ammo. Could have been real simple. Still can't understand why and/or how they were able to screw this up so bad. They have current workbench interfaces that actually work, why wasn't this built the same way? A bloody terminal with possibly the worst UI ever; almost feels intentionally poorly made. Like some sort of weird punishment. All I wanted to do was get some use out of spare ammo. The one time they actually give us something we asked for and its literally the worst possible incarnation of what it should have been. It simply makes no sense.
---
The thing is, I don't have fallout 76 installed on my SSD yet I load about 3 times faster than him (We have the same HDD) so I really don't understand what could be wrong with his pc.
---
I'd say so, you can also play this game by your self and you dont need a group if friends to play with
---
And it’s ugly as sin. Why did it need the free personal terminal attached to it? Way bigger than it needs to be...
---
I also got it on sale for much the same reason as you would. In terms of exploring the Bethesda world and finding really sad stories to get involved in, it's definitely there for you. Mechanics are closer to but I feel a bit cleaned up from FO4, new enemies are interesting. Most of my first foray into it was single-player and I enjoyed that enough to get a really deep dive come Wastelanders. So for $20? yeah, sure, why not?
---
Then go try the gamepass.
---
Worst case scenario you paid ~$5 for F76 and didn't like it but atleast you got access to other games for a month.
---
Best case scenario, you love F76 and buy the game for the price you mentioned
---
If you consider Junkie's to be well-balanced then I think TS and E are actually in a relatively fair place right now.
---
Using a TS gun buys you 25% damage at zero cost. Using a Junkie's or Berserker's gun buys you 50% damage, but that comes at the cost of 5 addictions or not wearing armor. If you make TS much stronger, then there will be no reason to pay the price to use a Junkie's or Berserker gun when you could have a TS at no cost.
---
Explosive is similar, except it can be tacked on to anything. For most builds it's just free damage. Any amount is good.
---
Realistically speaking, the problem with Bloodied is not that it's too powerful on its own (IIRC its damage is also 50% just like Junkie/Berserker). It's that it has synergy with a *giant* suite of perks and such that are intended to help players when they organically drop to low health, but also benefit the Bloodied player because they don't (and can't) discriminate. If the game was well-balanced, Bloodied as a prefix would not exist. Personally I also wouldn't put in Adrenal Reaction. There should only be one damage boost from being at low health, and it should be low.
---
Also, for what it's worth I play an Instigating Sneak Sniper. It's not really viable for the Queen, but it's good enough for the rest of the game. For my build and only my build, Explosive is an affix that does more damage but at a cost (often stops my Instigating damage when I'm dealing with a large group of enemies).
---
It's linked somewhere on this post
---
I can't stand the Ammo Converter. Tedious, too many screens even after the patch. Oh, and it's way too easy to accidentally convert .308 instead of .38, and it's definitely too easy to buy ammo you don't want instead of selling it due to trigger finger as a result of the TOO MANY SCREENS
---
Taming videos.  There have been some well done ones, but they mostly just focus on server hopping the cranberry glade.  It can take irl hours or day to actually find a tameable, and it isn’t a well known concept in game.
---
You could always roll until you get a weightless torso, and slap a jetpack on that for when you want to play around. 
---
I have SS+jetpack on 2 of my characters, but they are both bloody stealth (melee and rifles). My shotgunner is a full health Junkies build with Solar armor, so no jetpack on him (also he has a junkie’s combat shotgun, which is “magic” in VATS, so he doesn’t bother with the Gauss shotgun).
---
And my main is a bloody heavy weapons/explosives build, but he lives in power armor, and Fireproof keeps him safe. 
---
I do say I miss not having a jetpack when I play my shotgunner- the mobility of my other 3 is fantastic; you don’t understand it until you have it. All 3 have Marsupial+Bird Bones+Strange in numbers, the jetpack either gives me that extra bit of height, or a whole lot of extra distance.
---
I did the same. It’s complete junk. As usual, I was super excited about getting it, but would rather throw my excess ammo into my vendor because it is was too cumbersome using this contraption.
---
lmaooo thats a good point
---
Such are the joys on being in a private server. Power Armor, Bobbleheads and magazines are very few and far between. Log off and join a public briefly to pick up what you need. Spawns are much greater on public.
---
What? The FO1st exclusive items? There has been every month. This month it's a bed and a rug unfortunately.
---
It's easy to see it as being done "for fun, in their spare time" and make it seem like no big deal. 
---
I promise you however, that sizable mods have a ton of hours of work and updates put into them. A ton of hours. 
---
That's on top of the ability to be able to focus your entire efforts on one sole project until it's completed and not being responsible for maintaining other parts of the game. 
---
Modders have the ability to pick and choose passion projects to sink time into. Employees do what they're told, where they are needed. 
---
Modders alsonhave total creative control of their passion project, and those projects are use at your own risk. If it breaks the game, corrupts a save file.... You were warned. BGS can't do that. They can't release content and just say "Use at your own risk".
---
If we are at updates,  add cook all option
---
Do you mean the "sale" items, or the monthly Fallout 1st item that's released basically the first Tuesday of the month?
---
With 5 pieces and the bear arms perk maxed  a Fat Man weights 0.2 lbs
---
By comparison, the plan for the Fat Man weighs 0.25 lbs
---
Crazy, right? It was bad before but they actually managed to make it worse! WTF?
---
I heard "daily ops" and my heart sank. More daily content.
---
I'd personally much rather get content that I can choose to do on any given day for any number of hours, a certain amount of content within a longer time period if a time restriction is absolutely necessary, and then I could also choose not to play on any given day and not lose out on the benefits of logging in every single day to do those daily chores.
---
For example, instead of having a daily quest that we can do once per day, have it be repeatable 30 times per month, and it can even have a dynamic restriction to it, so that it allows you to do more of it as long as you're sticking to the 1/day limit. Let's say there'd be a repeatable quest you could do a maximum of 7 times per week. You could skip doing it for 6 days, then do it 7 times on the last day of the week. Then next day you could already do it once more, since you'd be keeping up with the 1/day restriction. Then just extend that to like two weeks or a month.
---
Obviously such a system would be way too intelligent for this game, I do admit that.
---
And that is really the only issue with daily content - that you have to play every day to max out the available rewards.
---
I know from my own experience, and from all of the people I know within that game, that World of Warcraft has burnt me out with daily content on several consecutive years now. I play for a while, do the daily stuff for a while, and then I just quit for a long time because of the repetitive, everyday chores.

Not the reddit for this go to one of merchant ones

I’m getting tired of Tesla’s during that event.   But more so during Uranium; people just block entrances with PA and spam Tesla; not allowing others to get the terminated management.  On top of the lag it’s infuriating
---
The most interesting thing with the BoS is seeing how they interact with the other factions, which could generally be described as "poorly."  They come in strong and aggressive, get into conflicts with seemingly weaker factions, and then get crushed either because they can't grow and adapt (West Coast) or because they lose the support they need by antagonizing everyone around them (Appalachia).  It's hard to say what the canon ending of FO4 was until we get FO5, but I honestly doubt it was Brotherhood victory there either.
---
We are going to rob the Whitesprings dry fellas’
---
Go game pass if you can. But I like the game. Don’t worry about the negativity.
---
Thank you for the offer buddy, but I just spent 2k on a explosive handmade 1 hour ago and I'm down to 5k at the moment, if you're still willing/able to trade in a couple of days I'll be up for it?
---
I recognize that name! You passed level 1500 yet?
---
oh, I didn't know there was a tracking site, I was searching in-game for a way to see the status. I only dropped off 500 because I thought it was bugged.
---
I have a fixation with the series evolving past meaningless iconography.
---
the most interesting fo76 video i saw was talking about the mechanics behind item/enemy spawns.. i enjoy watching videos that talk about the mechanics behind the scenes like that.. spawn chances, drop rates, etc.
---
different builds than bloodied in nutshell
---
Is there any reason, other then reaching the goals, to donate more or less?
---
Because they don't play their own game. Like pretty much every MMO out there they should have some kind of players council or even polls in their forums to understand what the players want.
---
Doesn’t work
---
You’ll get more demand out of selling the plan itself- people want it to mod their strangleheart armor; other people can’t mod that for them.
---
Its not bird bones. I don't have bird bones and I have this same issue
---
Exceeded by something like 60 mil lol
---
Good idea. Will look into thay. Thanks
---
I’m just saying for a good 3 month span there was no fallout 1st item released.
---
Are you on PS4? I probably know who it is.
---
Havent thought of that! Thanks!
---
They'd never do it cus those plants are needed to get you atoms. People will just spam them until they get the atoms. Beth don't like giving out free atoms like that.
---
Good to know, I'd just been mashing the 'Back' button and essentially retracing my steps.
---
Those aren’t fallout 1st items. Those are just free items for all players
---
I think it should work like a vendor robot. They can obviously limit what you can buy and sell. Why not just make a terminal that operates like an npc? They can make a vending machine for ammo but not a vending machine for ammo?
---
I'm certainly more enthusiastic about these Daily Ops, especially since it means 94 is coming back and 96 might be connected to it.
---
Yep, always check those suitcases people, I sometimes leave them with enough armament to take down a small country, leather to cover your camp and more broken glass than a sane man needs!
---
I saw this on r/fallout but you are on a sub about the game, why do you think all of us will say?
---
Thanks for confirming. It’s definitely Strange In Numbers but I never played around with the mutations I already had to find which one was causing the silly fluttery feet effect.
---
According to the news tab when you load up the game they are fallout 1st items...
---
no my other xbox mule account did not get these for free only the dufflebag
---
I honestly wonder if the reason they don't is because they'd have to give us a point amount per each individual ammo round rather than 20 points for 14 rounds or whatever the fuck they currently do
---
Oh so this is it, I've never used tesla before, tried it last night with a 3 star legend, and I am maxed on rifle and shotty perks, half the time it just shot through the first npc  I was aiming at with no damage and did little or no damage to the npc next to it, every so often it decided to work and that was nice.
---
There was.. What period was this? They had like a reskin of the same fan service from the Mojave for a long ass time but they have technically honored their obligations.
---
Unless you wanna chance at getting weapon/armor plans your missing not really,  community goals are the main thing for it.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_1st/Rewards
---
List of all the stuff you must have missed.
---
They didn’t need to make an ammo converter machine, just let us scrap ammo like any other item
---
Gonna log in quick and try again, BRB. :°
---
Edit : Jumped from the Honwright tower and only used the jet pack when I was close to the ground and I would have died without my luck perk. (it negated the fall damages but I still got both my legs broken) so, nope, it doesn't work.
---
You sure you're talking about the SS jetpack and not the PA jetpack? lol
---
I don't have fallout 1st
---
marsupial is enough. GSG without vats is NO NO NO :)
---
yes it seems only one person per server can turn this in , this is why it works on a private server
---
Shut up and take my money!!!!!!!!
---
I’d say just let us scrap ammo
---
In one of their statements before the season started, they said atoms would still be rewarded for dailys 'this season'.  I guess we'll find out, but I took that as implying that they would be removed from the rewards at some point afterwards.  They already nerfed them, so you can see where this is heading.  I hope they don't, but I wouldn't be surprised if they do this.
---
He’s probably hacking, FYI. 28 kills by yourself is absurd. 
---
Note: not all hackers fly around in the sky, just the most obvious ones. You can just turn on aimbot and infinite ammo and still murder everyone, it just takes longer but is way less obvious.
---
Even if it was just the lead
---
You can’t win, r/fallout is just the anti sub to this. They constantly bitch about 4 and 76 and obsess over a 10 year mediocre game.
---
So after building your stairs (and perfectly lining them up), you were able to attach a floor to the ledge that is at the top of the already existing stairs, is that right?
---
Wish I could help you out but I'm on PC. Try messageing someone on F76 Reddit Discord if they will let you use there private server.
---
Do the plans come from the boxes received after each donation?
---
You need a friend.  &lt;3
---
There has been though. This month is the bed and the rug. Last month's was the Bog Wanderer outfit. June was the Camo paint for Scout and Wood. May was Desert paint for the Riot Gear. April was the Raider and Settler tents.
---
Some are certainly better than others, but we have been getting them.
---
It sounds like it's a joke intended to upset Americans who are concerned with variations in regional dialects - I definately miss a lot of the culturally-specific humor

Floors don’t break
---
Best of luck getting a different and better one! You can recycle a Legendary at train Stations for Scrip, which you can then buy a random one from the Purveyor. Completely random, but you choose how many stars it has.
---
Most battle passes will have "infinite" levels. Every level after the final level is usually a reward crate (since most games nowadays have crates).
---
Fallout76 should take that concept as well. Either the challenges themselves reward atoms (5 per daily 25 per weekly?) Ooooor they could complete rank 100 infinite times and each time it gives you 100 atoms or something like that.
---
There is another option that I would honestly hate and guess most of you would. And that would be to introduce crates into F76. And each time you finish rank 100 it gives you a crate. But tbh this game does not need any more RNG and people would complain about it. So just plain atoms would be cool IMO.
---
And then you get refunded the atoms. At least that’s how it’s worked for me the few times I asked for a refund.
---
Maybe you have a stronger pc?
---
Yup, that's part of my loop.  I use this [https://youtu.be/214WLn7ptOQ](https://youtu.be/214WLn7ptOQ)  
---
That's so little cement against the 150 mil.  How many times a day can I do that loop?
---
Whoa, whoa, whoa! ...don‘t go making sense.
---
I was referring to this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/6z8pak/stop_asking_if_you_should_play_xfallout_game/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)
---
Also requires a server jump to initiate the reset I believe. So for private, I collect junk, do an item reset, and jump to a public server for 15 min. Then jump back into private and repeat the junk run.
---
I have 27 kills by myself on xbox (without nuke) Gt: donpichi666
---
And the max of kills on that console is 33 kills, also without a nuke.
---
A previous glitch allowed some things to be stolen with vending and display cases, but 99% of the player base is unaffected by glitches and exploits.
---
Maybe, but he still has a gtx1060 and an i5 which should be good enough to not have 3 minute loading times.

Since BETA

They are hoagies. They have always been hoagies and will always be hoagies. ONLY hoagies.
---
And the variant known as the cheesesteak is only made properly in Pennsylvania, with also rans coming out of Jersey and New York. You get inedible trash from anywhere else, especially amongst the hicks that say “steak and cheese.”
---
Clearly, these Sunny Protectrons need to be destroyed as enemies of the USA and all we stand for.
---
I didn't even know you can change it
---
Yeah i was dying repeatedly at line in the sand, normally pretty much invincible. Its all over the place every time i log in. Enquip and re equip a couple of time will normally straighten most of it out but not 100%
---
How do you put a jetpack on the t65 without a plan?
---
👍🏽
---
same. I just donated 1 stack of concrete but to my surprise I received 500 caps and ultracite Gatling laser plan! I was pleasantly surprised. I would donate more but yeah, even tho I also have FO1st I don't have much of some resources, but I will donate each at least once just for the clear conscious xD
---
they are bad but if you have the grounded mutation ithey are even worse
---
i can pop on for you now if you are on. 
---
250 caps each in my vendor
---
Really looking forward to the fallout shelters and PA display. I hit max budget a long time ago and have to delete something any time I want to add anything.
---
Yes but if you build your main stuff in one area and his little 1 by one square cube at the  very edge of that, he doesent tend to get up in your property so much.
---
Me too.
---
At least on xbox, they would ban a huge proportion of the player base if they did. They are in about 1/3 camps on public servers.
---
Yes I’m on rn
---
Shit. The world is on the tail end of a pandemic. Everyone is having a rough time. Making fun of their appearance is fucked.
---
Also... If they were seeking treatment then what the fuck is wrong with that? Are you seriously attempting to shame people for trying to better themselves?
---
Also, focusing on the negative aspects of the stream? Why not provide constructive criticism? Is there literally nothing that you liked? Why are you still here in that case?
---
There was a FAQ with the Devs at on quake on stream someone posted earlier. Said they're absolutely trying to get power armor displays and manikins to display outfits into the game. God knows when though.
---
I have said it before, and I will keep saying it until they add them to the growable list. At least give us Stilt Beans, Pumpkins and Cranberries. If the regular people of Appalachia could cultivate it, the best and brightest of Vault 76 should be able to figure it out. I can live without being able to grow every plant in the game, but some are just blatant exclusions. Also, yeah, fix VATS.
---
i assume it will either be on tuesdays atom shop update or at the end of the event
---
So I didn’t know this but after I got all the guns from gold and got the secret service I started buying t65. Well I bought everything except the helmet I didn’t have right away but when I went to craft it. I saw being I have the free states bundle and another bundle when I went to mod the chest I can install a jet pack so I did and I saw on here that it’s a bug. But like the moth man bundle I got I can’t install that one without knowing the jet pack. So like I have dark captain cosmos skin on it being it hides all the ugly parts of the armor but I have to keep free states jet pack. Plus I’m afraid to take it off in case they patched it
---
The servers could use a good house cleaning. Bethesda needs to grow a pair or this will all just turn to a wasteland version of gta.
---
True but what else is there to do until the next batch of bugged content is released?
---
Nah. Watched him. He was legit. This was also console. Head shot maniac.
---
Being E-7 isnt a personality trait, Chief. But I agree it is a hoagie.
---
Or just be able to toggle between score and atoms as a reward for completing challenges.
---
Or if you have a private server,  take the Red Rocket, place as many ammunition factories as your heart desires
---
I did say “probably” ;)
---
And hacked consoles exist don’t they? Just waaaaay less common than PC
---
Lol gotcha yeah there is definitely truth to that post. Still I’ve seen that sub usually pull some “NO, play NV instead it’s only $5!”
---
Based on *one game* having different ones.
---
I’ve seriously never heard anyone complain about caps being the standard currency in the Fallout universe from a lore perspective.
---
Bethesda *keeps* that from Fallout 1 and you **complain**.  Bethesda *changes* the BoS from Fallout 1, and you **complain**. 
---
I’m seeing a pattern here.
---
I'm just saying that is possible lol.
---
Jetpack is a game changer. I b-lined it to the SS torso and jetpack, no regrets.
---
I definitely agree there should be a way to display them. I remember when I was building up Settlements in FO4 always trying to have a Power Armor at the workstations there because they made the space have so much more character
---
Certain items like PA, Magazines, Cap Stashes and Bobbleheads have a very small chance to spawn each time a player enters that area. On a PW as the only player, you will see these items less often cause you are the only 1 running through the area and potentially triggering their spawn.
---
As someone else said, leave the area completely(I'm not sure if that means the entire region) and periodically go back for another chance at triggering the item's spawn.
---
Other way around then. Break the saucer then put the foundations down
---
I'd like this too, i'm not much of a camp builder (generally just go for utility rather than looks) but did like my little [PA garage](https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/643249463520375673/27F9B29FFEF0CF0FF0C4635464EFB7B32CA6F13F/#) i had setup in FO4.
---
With all the different skins etc it's be cool to have something similar in FO76

---
Theres one method involving farming Wendigos you can find it on youtube if you search wendigo screw farming
---
True, hardcore early Fallout game Fans will always be the same lol. They also get heated even mentioning 76.
---
It wouldn't be worth their time.
---
This is not me hating here but this is how I look at it in bullet points
---
- The season is meant to take 10 weeks.
---
- They changed the challenge system because barely anyone did them and didn't even care to when you could buy them instead. There no reason why after completing the season people would continue doing the challenges for atoms.
---
- The value the stuff in the season would be in the atom store would be worth more than you got from the old challenges (based on typical pricing).
---
- There is no reason for Bethesda to give atoms away for free no more. Reddit has a down voting problem which hides this but most of the players want to spend there money on this game. They don't want say, free double sided walls which you can wall paper on both sides, they want to buy the. They tell Bethesda so often what they will buy that even if you disagree with it. Most of the fan base do claim and suggest things to buy instead of what should be free.
---
These are points from what I found myself and can't confirm to be 100%
---
- More people want a paid extras in the season than challenges giving them free atoms.
---
- Most of the fan base subscribes to Fallout 1st. They already don't need more atoms and if they did, they'd prefer to buy them over earning them.
---
So in short. There no reason offer free atoms after completing the season because barely a minority would do such challenges. The majority  want to buy stuff instead.
---
GT? my camp is near top of the world
---
Yup they do, but most can be purchased from vendors.  There are a few rare ones like heavy raider that a few people have been hunting but the drop rate is pretty low I imagine
---
Yea but once to pick them they take a while to grow back just like anywhere else . I live around loads of the flowers I just want to put them together
---
InsaneXXL7
---
Good old Bethesda.
---
Hes the most annoying one yet, I have the basic bitch robot at my newest CAMP because hes the least obnoxious
---
People here are fairly anti now.  I'd say 50/50.
---
Edit:  Fallout 4 and 76 are mediocre.
---
This is more than likely caused by the recent patch to camp building. The footage from QuakeCon was probably done a month or more ago.
---
... nope not gonna do it... NOT... GONNA- "BROTHELS"!!! damnit...
---
A better way to heal the damage from the pylon is cola nut and using nuka colas, with the maxed perk even just normal cola heals you fast enough to be decent, and regens ap decently. Nuka cherry is better (restore 300hp each), and if you have quantums they will outheal both the three pylons and allow you to mostly shrug off the boss damage if you have strong defense.
---
Way more cost efficient than stims.
---
Isn't the converter 1st only? Why would they give people a reason not to sub?
---
Every Tuesday they switch them out. It should be back with a few months that one seems to get put in more often than some others.
---
If he doesn't have em for you, ill hop off NW and make em if you need.
---
Yeah, I can honestly see why FC is not for everyone. But for me, he makes me smile without fail. He's like Christmas cheer all year.
---
Is it in a machine ?
---
I think there should still be like 1 daily thats worth atoms instead of score
---
Quite easy to make at tinker bench
---
*sigh* Take an upvote and get out.
---
Thank you so much!
---
What platform? I'll give you screws
---
I wouldn't mind if they had a volume setting on them
---
Tallest building in Abandoned Bog Town. Secret room accessible from the roof! Typewriters, fans galore!
---
I'm not at a level yet to be able to craft it
---
Xbox One.
---
True hardcore early Fallout game fans would probably point you to Fallout 2 tbh. New Vegas was a newer generation of fans.
---
That was kinda an important part of the old main quest line
---
Easy but boring way to get 100s of screws. 
---
https://reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hvsscy/_/fyvqxm5/?context=1
---
Same!! I only go into PA if I absolutely have to.. then I can't run or fast travel.. and it does have calibrated shocks. 
---
Losing the weight reduction from regular armor totally screws up my weight when I have to slap on PA. 
---
I had to stop playing last year just after Fasnacht and didn't get to come back until right before it this year. When I stopped playing the only time I was out of PA was to use a bench, cook, sleep or play an instrument.. all due to the carry weight.. made a few changes when I came back and well now wearing it is something I do everything I can to avoid!
---
Maby during the event make it so when you damage legendarys or region enemys all lit from those enemys go into 1 blood pile instead of everyone avoiding the event also tone down damage for multiple players in the event so no more 1 shotters and this will force everyone to be a damage conduit
---
Btw if you're on PS4 I can probably put the CS on your armor for you if you'd like..
---
You need a friend, racist.
---
Must suck being filled with so much hate.
---
But then again, you're a lonely cunt. When you cry yourself to sleep tonight, ask yourself how you got to the place.
---
Hope this helps.
---
Are you sure? I just tested it and it doesn't work
---
Add me, I got you. GT: CarlosSpceyWnr
---
I'll be at my camp
---
This
---
Yes!  In fo4 I had a huge power armor collection all on display.  Nice to be able to see the armor skins even if you never use them.  However with the CAMP budget system this may prove a problem
---
I just throw the explosive bait at them?
---
Looks like we have a paradigm fan
---
Remember it's a mobile game with fancy graphics
---
You play on xbox?
---
Agreed but I dont use those perks. And the amount of Stim packs I just drop to make space, makes me not care to much about how inefficient they are.
---
I just traveled all over the map to collect 35 bags of cement to be able to donate 250 concrete exactly once. I have doubt that the goal of 150 million concrete will be reached.
---
Yeah but PCs cost a craptonne of money lmao
---
Honestly I run both on differnt sets. Switch out my chest when im out adventuring and pop on my dense when im going to sbq or radiation rumble or things like that where i might blow myself up with my gauss shotty but while adventuring i use a quad handmade to tag so im not one shotting everything anyway.
---
How do you "flamethrower it", exactly? I can't move my C.A.M.P. until I figure out how to do interior walls.
---
Chain.
---
I mean, in fairness you are building these things out of scavenged busted materials.
---
It's not like you are going around to hardware stores and buying premium timber and glasswork. You pulled that stuff out of dilapidated ruins in a post Armageddon world.
---
Just how many intact pieces of window glass would be left after 25 years of constant desperate violence, looting, and outright warfare.
---
Caps being retained as a currency was met with almost universal confusion upon Fallout 3's release. The in-universe excuse for their existence on the east coast remains unsatisfying.
---
If I get to the S.S. armour ghillie skin I'll be working towards getting a full set soon hopefully, can't stand the power armour in fallout 76, just seems far to buggy.
---
Edit: funni joke, it's your cash up to you
---
Unfortunately there is nothing, but I'm in the game now, you can try again if you still want. I remember I had to add friends several times because it didn't work.
---
There is fallen crate with mines on roof of morgantown airport (Responders hq) next to crashed vertibird.
---
Very cool. Do you take orders or sell ‘em on Etsy?
---
There are a bunch of good players, good luck.
---
Try to play with them, they will teach you stuff.
---
No. Maybe if it was before the legendary run I’d say yes but it’s turning into a mobile game/fortnite clone
---
We do not carry water ice. Water is not also ice.
---
I keep taking pictures of all the ammo I want to convert just so I know which option I should be clicking on. Just let me click on the ammo I want to get rid of and give me the points. I hate getting to the end of it and I still have 3 or 4 of every ammo I was trying to convert.
---
There's nothing flagrantly wrong with your build but can you explain what you want to improve? Damage,  survivability, something else?
---
I enjoy the Fallout series and always told my hisband they should make a multi player version. When they did, I was excited. Then, I wasn't excited because there weren't NPCs and it was lonely. 
---
Then, Wastelanders came out and after a while, I started playing again. As any game, there are pros and cons, but for me, the pros outweigh the cons. 
---
I can enjoy the game by myself, or join my husband and friends and play in a team. Sometimes, we do our own thing while in the group..other times, we group up and do events. 
---
Yes, there are things about the game I don't like and wish they'd fix or implement but, I play for fun so I don't get too upset at Bethesda (except when the servers crash lol)
---
For $19.99, I'd say it's worth giving it a chance.
---
Follow someone in and grab it after the place is cleared out. EDIT: I’d be happy to run interference for you if you’re on Xbox
---
Yeah I agree the suffix “explosive” is in a great spot. But weapons that benefited from demolition expert have honestly never been in a good spot.
---
But the thing about two shot is it’s not always going to hit. It’s not every bullet you get is +25%. It’s more like a 110-115% total.
---
\*Holds the back button after 15 minutes of looping through menus\* Thank God!
---
I like this person
---
I see, so that's how power armor spawns work.
---
Yeah there’s some justifiable backlash after this patch, as there should be. Bethesda can and should do better, still love 76 tho.
---
And NV wasn’t? 3 blew my mind in 2008 NV didn’t come close. Take away all the good things Fallout 3’s skeleton gave to NV and you’re not left with a lot. If obsidian had to start from scratch it would’ve been like The Outerworlds.
---
Its not, its a legendary run reward
---
Damage I suppose. Right now it does not seem very consistent with Charred Feral Ghouls, Robots, etc. Sometimes it is a 1 shot and other times 5 to 6. Very inconsistent. Maybe it's a game issue??
---
Pc. 
---
But the point is this is a frequent problem, so I suggest they move it, or, at least have the ghouls in that particular shop be locked at level 30 or something.
---
It was so strong lol
---
There should be an option to donate your excessive SCORE to others. Maybe to some player in need of getting that special cosmetic item from race, but lack both atoms and daily/weekly challenges to obtain said item.
---
You know, just like "your junk is another newbie treasure".
---
No it wasn’t. Nuka-Cola was never exclusive to the west coast and FO3 was set over 100 years after FO1. The NCR dollars were exclusive to the NCR. Why would they be used on the east coast?
---
There have been variant currencies in the other games as well, usually dependent omg he area and/or faction. But there’s nothing problematic with caps being an accepted baseline standard. 
---
Tell me why Nuka-Cola shouldn’t be a currency on the East Coast.
---
Does it still give you a bounty if you open the wrong one.? That is why I have several hundred sat in my stash gathering dust.
---
After the failed launch I told myself I'd never buy it. However. After the last sale and wastelanders I had a friend recommend it.
---
I has a LOT of bugs and lacking a LOT of quality of life improvements.
---
However. Despite all that I'm having a blast! The trick is to think of it like a single player game (not expecting updates or fixes..) and it becomes a lot more fun.
---
Also, get a microphone and talk as much as possible. I've met some amazing people and the game wouldn't be half as fun without them.
---
It's a good idea on paper. Thats about it
---
I may have some stashed away. I'll check for ya when I get home from work. 👍
---
Yep I am.. if you know him buy him a beer from me :)
---
I have been playing around with my build since lvl 75. What I've got now has been the best I've come across so far. Max your VATS concentrated fire, and only level up your commando perks twice. remove some of the points from agility and put them into luck. For reference my  S.P.E.C.I.A.L. - 2-15-6-6-3-12-12

I don't run cookie cutter builds. I pull a lot of aggro, and do a reasonable amount of damage. Still one shot most normal enemies too
---
I don’t know, I’ve done that mission a dozen times for a dozen characters. Sometimes I’d get lucky with a cleared area, or I’d be able to sneak by, and it was a breeze on a private world when they spawned in closer to my level. Other times, less lucky like you are now. I don’t think they should change the location, there’re not in a shop, they’re in a building marked historic. And honestly this game is so easy you’ll welcome the memories of a time you had to fight to get something. Good luck with it!
---
The one wasteland update will fix this problem for you when it gets released
---
I agree that the Missile Launcher, Fat Man, etc need massive buffs. IMO if I bother to carry around a Fat Man and get a direct hit it should one shot anything short of an SBQ.
---
You could essentially make those two guns deal infinite damage (with direct hits) and they would still be pretty fair, because the ammo is just so heavy it acts as a strong limiter.
---
It only reduces up to a total of about 90% but yes. It's amazing for bank alts or if you want to farm steel or line line in the sand.
---
No regrets. Try rolling for acrobat pieces on the SS pieces. All you need is 2 of them and it eliminates all fall damage.
---
If you only want the torso and jetpack you can find other armor types with acrobat on them. That's what I did until I could afford the full SS set and get the rolls I wanted. 
---
The jetpack is my favorite thing in the game, no doubt!! 👍👍
---
Anyone else notice if you put the sink on a top floor the pipes show through the ceiling? 🤣👍
---
I'm pretty sure that part of the quest is legit broken. I had to hop servers, and restart the quest. Sadly you will have to skip past opening that room. Rest of the quest should be okay. If u need help re-clearing the robots on Xbox let me know.
---
I'll pass the word along.
---
The friends list bug sucks and seems to be random, as for server stability seems like something on your end. I can run every single workshop at once for 8+ hours.   
---
Have you checked for packet loss? Are you hard wired or WiFi? Is it on an external or internal drive? Do you have a junk SSD?
---
I've got a brahmin plan, add me razzmiiberries
---
I hate it as much as I hated the pressure plates bugging in Oblivion’s Aeylid ruins or whatever. Age old. Bugs, Long loading/ freezing screens and the pairing, random terrifying juddering noises late at night that makes you question reality. All the trolling charms of most Bethesda games . And weight management is of course the real game.  So you really do get all the creature comforts of any Fallout/TES game.
---
However I also love it for the same reasons. I get immersion, the vistas, the scavenging is on par. It’s only get bad when you take it for a serious MMO. Or want to stick walls together 🤷‍♂️ 
---
Tbh they are severing the lore and shit.
---
I just want the bundle with the damn buttercup rideable back I was taking a break during that time and missed that and the gold fuzzy by 2 minutes.
---
How about a "Dear Bethesda" site with qol suggestions.
---
does not reduce weapon weight on items in your vendor / stash tho, so don't be surprised when you add an item to sell and it weighs 20lbs again.
---
If you have windows 10, and if Xbox Game Pass is still $1 for 1 month.. get that and try Fallout 76 to see if you like it.
---
Cause people can be dickheads.
---
I've been contemplating adjusting my luck points utilizing Critical Savvy and Better Crits.
---
Maybe the trade invite is to see if you have any junk to steal?
---
Once you beat all of the quest line with Duchess go and loot the Wayward once a day, along side the daily cap reset. Grab all of the hotplates in the torture room upstairs, pepper shaker on the oven behind Duchess, and sometimes she even sells hot plates. I normally get 20 or more screws from this everyday.
---
no but the same thing happens with the Grognak Bundle; the throne goes through the ceiling.
---
RAM issues and/or bottlenecking.
---
Maybe that was the plan all along, make the game as miserable as possible to force the players to play their nw. That way they no longer need to fix the bugs on the survival mode.
---
Explains a lot... like when we get orbital strike beckons from the quest prior to launching a nuke. Jokes on us for even picking them up, even big jokes for throwing them at her.
---
Converter - &gt; transfer all - &gt; receive
---
That's not just more user friendly. That would literally be making it so good, that buying ammo would be pointless. You could just pick up ammo and drop it all in the converter at the same time instead.
---
I don't know if I've seen much of that on YT. 
---
If you guys are interesting, I'd watch that.
---
equip stealth-boy or buy if u dont have it.
---
so sad they made the game so easy to beat. do u really enjoy it when nothing challenges u?
---
This was patched out this week I think.
---
So, there’s a specific bug to resource nodes like plants and ore veins. Basically when you pick them, there’s a timer before you can pick that specific one again. 
---
But if you leave that area for long enough, or switch servers, it may respawn the visual plant/ore vein, and even show the interact button, but you still can’t actually pick it again until the timer resets. I forget how long it is; for world items I believe it’s around 20 hours, for camp crops it’s much less.
---
If I see an area clustered with players below level 30, I travel over and active one for them!
---
I don’t get how bush wooking is fun.
---
Personally to me every NW Afker and Bush Wookie just doesn’t want to learn NW. They want the rewards without the work.
---
And don’t give me that “But I suck at PvP”
---
No! no problem in PS4
---
Because caps being a currency was a silly detail of one game.
---
I haven’t played in a little while so this may be outdated but there’s a couple of reasons to invite you to trade...
---
1.  To see what you have in your inventory, if you have a lot of screws etc that is worth killing you for
---
2. To get you close enough for any of your mutations to proc (if this is still a thing) your mutations proc and damage them, initiating pvp!
---
As I say I haven’t played in a while so if I’m wrong someone let me know and I’ll delete my comment!
---
Thank you for sharing that
---
Jetpack, marsupial, and bird bones. 0 fireproof I run a gauss and a BE gat plasma. Got fast runners coming at you jump fly vats kill rinse repeat.
---
Thanks dude, I guess I’ll just clear it again some other time - been in there for hours now, that’s definitely a “log off and leave it alone for a week” bug. They really should’ve laid off the pints of crack while coding this.
---
Was it?  I have not looked at the patch notes.
---
8hrs is absurd, but let’s be clear- the OP completed the daily CHALLENGES.
---
The daily *quests* take quite a bit longer, and farming up Scrip to hit that daily cap, plus daily Caps cap, and daily Bullion....
---
If you’re chasing maximizing every single daily limit, it takes quite a bit longer. For me it’s in the realm of 2-3 hours, depending on Public Events etc.
---
Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
---
Let's nerf everything because of emotions!
---
Thanks for this I’ll try it tomorrow
---
It literally already does that. It just takes slightly longer. Plus, people will still buy ammo they need, its not like the converter gives a lifetime supply. I constantly need fuel for my DE flamer, just because the converter came out doesn't mean I no longer buy it from vendors.
---
Just like most of things in this game! Lol. 😂
---
I’d agree with what everyone is saying and get it through gamepass and do a trial run. Recently, on PC at least, people have been targeting newer players and harassing them. I commented on a post about this the other day where someone actually did it to me and a group mate, little did the guy know I actually had a high level character. So I’d try to find someone in the level 50-100 range to at least tag along and give you insight on how the game works and as a deterrent. That being said, they won’t need to stick with you and this game is based about going at your own pace. If you do decide to get the game, send me a message and I don’t mind helping out. I can be on a lower level alt to not one shot everything.
---
Got a link? or do I need have a discord account to see it?
---
I haven’t tried it. But there was this one listed in the notes that seems like it’s that trick. 
---
“Exploit: Fixed an exploit related to scrapping Assaultron Helmets.”
---
Yeah,  steel was easy to get via looted weapons.  I have no idea how to get lots of concrete.  Donated the 750 I had.
---
I mean, this is the fourth character. When I originally did it I served hopped until I found a better server, but that is annoying
---
The only time I’m aware of mutation proccing enabling PvP is when the attacker is already Wanted with a bounty. But the last time I did any serious testing of that was over a year ago.
---
Damn, some serious cry babies posting on this. The ammo converter, yes may be slow, but atleast they gave it to us. If you don't like it don't use it.
---
Did you miss the part where I used a whole pile of stealth boys and tried sneaking? I don’t know if enemies 40 levels higher than you have an easier time piercing stealth but they instantly saw me every time as soon as I came in range no matter how slowly I walked.
---
Well I mean, technically yes the luck perk helped, but I feel as if it somehow activates for me everything while using the ss jet pack
---
Depends on what you most love about the game.
---
Storyline?  A deep &amp; engaging story like finding your Dad, or your Son, or just getting some good 'ole fashioned revenge on someone who shot &amp; left you for dead.
---
* Nah - the story just isn't that good in 76, even after Wastelanders' update.
---
Building a character &amp; combat, exploration, and scavenging materials as a whole game loop?
---
* Then hell ya, if you like Fallout beyond the story you'll like this.
---
It's definitely best if you can get at least 1 or more friends to play though.
---
Reminder: Don't forget to watch this next time you're taking a shit you cunt
---
YES!
---
When you are on the private world page (one in the middle) press x I think it is, something like this happened to me and my mate and it wouldn’t let him go in with me.  If you press x then it lets you change to who can be invited.
---
Mai doot, I am not here trying to get in an internet argument over intentions. I was not maliciously trying to call you out or throw shade.
---
There are a few “unintended features” in 76, mainly for the benefit for the player. I am not going to try to tell you what is or is not a bug. I just know that what others may seem as a bug, is the benefit of others.
---
Better Crits is okay but, the damage return ranking it up after the first one isn't worth it. Granted I run an auto build, with a No VATS furious combat rifle. However, you may be correct in thinking that it might work for a rifleman build. The only thing that changes for me when I swap between Sniper &amp; Commando is my perception perks.
---
P- (Rank 3) Tank Killer, Long Shot, (Rank 2) Reg., Exp., Mas. Rifleman &amp; Sniper (Rank 1) Concentrated Fire
---
\*EDIT\* You may want to consider bird bones &amp; carnivore mutations. Queen battles always leave me with a lot of meat, it's my primary food source. I also use a perk loadout manager, as the above is only for public events. I had a higher dmg build, but I would one shot legendaries and I didn't want to be 'that guy' at public events. I also keep a couple niche weapons on hand for grinding specific areas or buildings; zealots, mutant &amp; ghoul slayers can be pretty helpful when farming mats.
---
Well - just tried it. Super-duper no longer works when crafting the helmets.
---
It is. Beserker+sneaky for survival. It's really easy to build for too since beserker weapons and weightless armor aren't exactly meta.
---
So, it was bad writing &amp; storytelling to have Nuka-Cola bottlecaps as a currency in Fallout 1?  Even though it’s explained quite clearly *why* that was an accepted currency?
---
You would have thought they could have enabled them with the hotfix.
---
You can't just drop all ammo in at once, you have to drop a certain amount of stacks each time. That limit help ammo selling be relevant, even tho people can convert.
---
Special types of ammo will always be sold, like flamer fuel, but the same can't be said about stuff like 5.5, if we could convert everything all at once.
---
If only they made the horse on a stick mount go at 60 speed. I want to ride across Cyrodiil on it damn it.
---
As others already mentioned you need starched genes 2. However I also recommend class freak and strange in numbers. Combined with every non-melee mutation possible. you get SO much.
---
That guy complained about the challenges take 8 hours for him, not the quests.
---
I’ve also got an instigating gauss shotgun on bloodied with full perks and I think I get close to 300 per pellet to the queen, and with a junkies and 5 addictions I do about the same, without sneak attacks. So you’ll be able to do some massive damage
---
Laggy Shot for my Gauss Rifle.
---
I swapped out my jet pack for dense the other day because of the same problems now run 1 fire proof and dense.
---
I don’t really miss the jet pack unless I forget I don’t have it and jump off the top of the light house to the gorge bridge .. like I did today!
---
Because I now run a vats heavy build every bit of AP is important I can usually get 4 or 5 headshots in a row with my heavy weapons now
---
Idk what it is about 76. Ive played Fallout since the first game in 1998, this installment though.... like. They ignored us or made things way too tedious.
---
My LMG is Cookie Monster Eats all the .308 and anything infront of it.
---
Exactly
---
That's exactly right. It was a fun little detail that wasn't meant to hold up to scrutiny, let alone become a series icon.
---
True. And 90% reduced weight won’t help a fully modded missle launcher. The Quad barrel is like 15 weight itself.
---
Thanks for the pointer. I have not tried Better Crits yet with my current build, just something I was considering.
---
Soundproof walls or a corked floor?
---
That's fixed. Your first point is valid but I'd add it's also to see your load out to determine if you're easy to roll. I had a pvper call me a scrub builder at my camp after looking at my trades. I just pve and try to give people aid stuff. Hence the responder flair.
---
Did anyone get when Devan said "Oh fuck" silently when she shit the fast travel bug twice?
---
For real. I would of loved if they used a more modern m4 style peep sight  where it's not so obstructive and the actual sight is bigger, But the ar 10 was first designed in the 50s. The image I seen had the m16 style carry handle. Kinda wish they would used that but its whatever. I still dont understand why they made an ar 10 instead of an ar15, and then put it only on the ak47. It reminds me of the vid I watched of people saying ak15 and ar47. CRINGE.
---
No idea why people boot low levels other then an elitist BS mentality.
---
If you enjoy fallout you will get your money’s worth out of this game. There will be things you like and probably things that annoy you but even if you just roll through the story solo you will get your fix for more fallout. With the wastelanders expansion the dialogue is very special heavy, so your build will influence how conversations go. 
---
The game itself somehow has the best and worst support simultaneously.. I don’t think I’ve played an online game where the dev team was so dedicated to providing new stuff and content.. that said the dev team is bethesda so a lot of their new content is wonky on launch then slowly gets fixed and re broken until it’s functional. 
---
The community as a whole is pretty great, 99.99% of the people playing just want to help you out. 
---
The legendary run as well as the Addition of a lot of currencies have turned some people off.. but for me I mostly ignore it and do my own thing.. I may not make as much or score as high but I enjoy my time and redeem stuff just the same.
---
Says who?  You?
---
What makes you an authority on what should or should not have become representative of the Fallout series?  Did you work for BIS?
---
Yeee. It is an older style ar peep. Sucks.
---
I’ve spend about that amount of time playing, I also did vault raids but I’m guessing my total queens killed is about 500 or more. I’ve gotten no Calibrated shocks to drop but I did get two emergency protocols and almost all of the others, just missing targeting hud and calibrated shocks, I think
---
Super Gooper for a plasma rifle
---
Its still very easy now. It only took me 10 minutes to convert ~20k useless rounds into ammo I wanted. Its still very easy to do, it just could be more user friendly. Plus people rarely buy stiff like 556 anyways, because of how common, cheap, and readily available it is. On the m@rket it usually goes for about .5 caps a piece. Plus the daily challenge that makes you buy stuff from people usually results in them buying your ammo up since its cheap
---
Love my LMG, but it definitely eats ammo
---
Just gimme a rifleman buff and were good
---
Cockflap bellend twatwaffle
---
I fully endorse it. I wanna name my dog Bilbo's Butterball
---
it's a decent value on sale
---
I'm sorry , it just seems your team mates are DICKS
---
The baconater
---
I can help you out tomorrow if you are still struggling to get it. But I agree, I got it when someone nuked the place, ran in with a hazmat suit while high levels cleared. This has been an issue for a very long time
---
I want the FIDO or the k9000 from old world blues. Heavy gun using some lesser used ammo.
---
Pls tell me that’s a flamer
---
Will we be able to put wallpaper on both sides of the wall?
---
I remember doing this quest with a buddy when we were both lvl 40 something and it was the hardest thing, but fun. Eventually we took turns and he led the hoard away so I could go in and scoop it up. I remember stealth boys not working either hahaha. Now at level 249 nothing challenges you...
---
Can I request a middle finger emote?
---
Yeah it is.  Cooks everything including me.
---
When you did them naturally how did you do it?
---
I feel the exact same way about Bethesda. I don't really care much for the money they spent to legally adopt the franchise - they've clearly mismanaged it since they started trying to write for it.
---
Nope, not at all. Im a semi vats build, hasn't been a issue for me. I for one love the mobility so much. I have two shotguns a BE pump and a Gauss. When something gets to close I Jet pack out even if its a short burst like marsupial just a little higher. I also run fire proof level 3. I recently switched Armor sets to a full SS and I've been trying to take significant self damage with the shotguns but its not a problem any more since switching. I had that problem with scout armor. My physical dmr is 340 it will probably be 400+ after I get all the buttressed mods, I think that's what helps with explosives.
---
Double sided of course.
---
Anti-Materiel Rifle!
---
Geez, what gun is it, and why that name?
---
I gotchu, damn shame though, those were the days
---
More 1 handed melee.
---
This was my 1 month check-in from initially getting the ammo converter, and being super pissed that it was useless.  Haven't played the game since.  I mean if they are gonna give us useful stuff at least make it useful.   
---
Oh well, they haven't fixed it yet.  Maybe I will check back in another month... might just uninstall the game and be done with it.
---
I feel this, I helped a guy build a camp based on a red rocket gas station a while ago, except whenever they went to move it, since they wanted something like a survival tent, they would have to basically rebuild it since the foundation blocks weren’t actually connected, and the blueprint feature didn’t help since he didn’t have all the items learned
---
How do you keep on top of 308 and 5mm? I dump a 2k ammo every queen fight 😤
---
Move some charisma and intelligence in agility. Use it to get sneaky. Automatic is more powerful as well, move to a commando in perception. Get a furious ffr or aa ffr handmade. In sneak with those weapons, damage will be more than enough.
---
Lol I remember I called two of these when I was around level 15 and I got items for level 30. And they weren’t legendary so I scrapped them.
---
It was exceeded by more than 200 mil actually by the end
---
I thought it was stupid too until I started my alt and my partner gave me a baseball bat with heated coils.  That thing slayed compared to everything else available to me at that time.  You don't have to use only the melee or keep using it forever.   But if you have a good melee weapon for when you start running out of ammo--which you surely will when low level--it's fantastic.  But absolutely, if you have low level ammo to share, that's great too.
---
Im still playing 2 years later, got bugs but i still like it.
---
I think it would be cool. A variation of the keypad access door and one that only allows private team members and yourself entry. Could make a proper bunker then.
---
Holo Rifle and pretty much every other weapon from fnv. Laser Musket too
---
They weigh a pound each, so it won't be easy to hoard a ton of them.
---
Is there any part of this game that isn't bugged?
---
is adrenaline still broken?
---
The Divorcer for my je mini because it just destroys homes
---
Clearly, Fallout has been mismanaged from your perspective since the start.
---
Bethesda’s writing is just as valid as Black Isle’s. They have both used similar approaches and tropes and structure.  There are no inherent flaws in Bethesda’s writing compared to Black Isle’s.
---
bastard is hording them
---
Awesome thank you. Let me know
---
viable handguns in a non addicted or low health build would be nice.. wouldnt even have to add anything other than buffs and or additional synergy
---
Huh.  Their ticker stopped at 212 mil on the website.
---
I like it. With a terminal to hack.
---
That Overseer idea would be great and something they should still heavily consider.
---
Lag....the system isn’t able to register her death in time.
---
Bethesda's writing is several steps down in quality.
---
You can attach floors and even walls to the prefab stairs. Things attached to them tend to never want to be deleted though, so be careful.
---
I've never gotten a decent drop. The best I get at from the mole
---
The complaint people have with Bloodied isn't that it's the best build.
---
It's that it's the best build BY FAR. The gap of effectiveness should be inches, not miles.
---
I’ve had this happen before, I just sat there and restarted the game a couple times. I think that fixed it. It’s been a while so I don’t remember everything I did, but since about a month ago when servers were down for a day, I’ve had a lot more issues trying to log into my account.
---
Lovely. I still don’t understand why I received a bit of the reward tho. And of course, her carcass disappeared too, so no looting.
---
Lmg guy here. Can kill anyhing. At the expense of using 50000 rounds a day. How do you guys keep topped up ?
---
I bought the game last month when it was on sale on steam for around the same price.
---
I avoided buying it for a long time because of the negative reviews.
---
Since buying it, I have played over 200 hours and I’m loving it. I’m a solo player and haven’t had problems with it being a multiplayer game.
---
The only time you really play with others is public events but even then, you don’t have to communicate as long as you understand how to complete it.
---
I would say yes get it :) I haven’t regretted buying it and I LOVE building my camp and getting new plans!
---
FISH IN A BARREL 
---
Instigating 90% weight Auto grenade launcher i carry around for line in the sand. 
---
Don't worry. I only usually fire it once as i'm not a selfish clownshoe.
---
It’s so annoying Atleast drop a M EXe or something
---
I pick my shots, dude. Usually Take them and miss. But sometimes. Double barrel to ur back. Bye bye.
---
This is entirely correct.  If management were competent, they would have taken steps to resolve the issues, and replaced the developers if they couldn't execute that plan.  Maybe the devs are incompetent too (honestly, they probably are, because a lot of their mistakes are things even the most junior dev should know how to handle), but that's not the root problem.
---
It's pretty clear the management is utterly incompetent.
---
Alot of ammo crafting. Or just use a magic heavy weapon for now whilst they are still working.
---
no disconnects but every 5 mins or so now i get server not responding.
---
The 2* is an event reward. I think you get it regardless of the outcome.
---
This is where I found mine too :)
---
I have missed all 4 rides, I want them all so badly! I hate the FOMO business model so much.
---
Ive been playing since beta and it had a shitty start but even if slow the updates do make it better. There are so many holotapes and lore to be found I still am exploring.  I play solo with mic or just in fo1st with the NPC roll every so often. It may not be a normal Fo but its worth it.
---
That is odd. I just completed it about a week ago, and it worked fine on mine. I’m on Xbox, if it helps.
---
not sure if thats the case, but i know that there is a max limit of how much of them you can have in youre inventory,
---
i came to a point where i couldnt pick them up, getting a notification that i reached the max limit
---
so maybe 256 of them are to much, you could try to drop all that you have in your inventory, then take 100 out of your stash, drop them and then take the rest 👍🏼
---
Not sure, but if you position the base correctly, he'll walk  across the bottom of the pond at the Whitespring.  Lol
---
That’s good to know, was it fixed in latest patch?
---
Pints of crack? I lol’ed at this! What a measurement! It would explain a lot, tho!
---
Finding myself unable to get excited about anything discussed simply because it's *so* far out. They take too long, leave too many bugs, and very consistently break things that were fine every addition... I've logged thousands of hours, nearly finished the Legendary Run, and feel burnt out with nothing new to do except donate a ton of resources to an event I don't care about for a reward I don't want or need.
---
After using a single character since beta I finally made an alt, built up a really cool camp, and now have hit the point where I'm bored again.
---
The only thing keeping me from leaving is FOMO and frankly that both makes me angry and makes me want to play something else and forget about this mess.
---
I disagree, and you’ve yet to cite a valid example. 
---
Tell me, what *do* you like about Fallout?  Any of it?  Other than FO2 (which seems to be the only one you like), what did you like about FO1,3,4,NV or 76?  Anything at all?
---
Its a great event.  The machine has little to do with the actual event.
---
The problem is that if you really wanted to you could power armor glitch through them. They’d look good though
---
Well I am betting next week or the week after we will see the golden version of the rocket so maybe they will bring back the others as greatest hits...maybe.   
---
You can look it up in the ATX datamine.
---
I've read that the Hasty .50 cal receiver is a little better than the hardened receiver for dps as well.
---
No she just gave me a mutant slayer rolling pin. Yesterday was a ghoul slayer or something. She’s apparently a rolling pin dealer.
---
not sure if i do something wrong but i tuned 900 bullets into like 180
---
Honestly if I knew what I was doing better I wouldn't care but I use it so keep me in shells lol its more of a end of the night, having a smoke before I shut it down thing I do.
---
I would love love LOVE......skins for the Final Word.....also M1 Garand would be sweet. Love the way it sounds when it reloads.
---
You mean an ugly beret isn't good enough when we already have countless other amazing looking head cosmetics to choose from?
---

I think this would be a great idea, except from what we’ve seen from the original brotherhood of Appalachia, they are ant that strong. They spend all their resources trying to clear glasses caverns and one mid to high level player can easily clear it themselves without any issues. Unless I’m missing something and the west coast brotherhood is much stronger than those of the east coast, I think they would try but barely make it through the very beginning of the vault.
---
Hunters \* Boxing Glove for me just now :)
---
You can still do double walls. Granted your options are more limited now than what they were, it is still doable. Just requires placing the first wall, destroying it with a flamer trap, placing the second, then repairing the first. Relocated and rebuilt my base yesterday, so I got to do that a ton.
---
We get them monthly
---
If im teamed with randoms, then I'll stay near by, but wont stay right next to them
---
If your all huddled together then it only takes 1 well placed frag grenade to ruin your day
---
Usually the players that run off are newbies to battle royales or are bush campers
---
I assume because an "Enclave faithful" scheme is further in the pipeline as a real-money skin or even more absurd farming reward.
---
 I'm 2182 now
---
Ohhh ty
---
I'm just glad I got a full set of unyielding heavy combat armor from her when that was the only thing you'd get from completing Scorched Earth. Now we get some variety, but it's still almost always the same old useless weapons with bad effects.
---
My crit meter fills so fast. Thanks to the psychopath/crit savvy combo that I get crits every 3-4 rounds. I like my rifleman build, but when it comes to public events it doesn't compare to the auto build.
---
Anyone else thinks regs and smiley is the same person. I think he just doing the smiley act to sell the gold he steals from the other secret service agents
---
It’s supposed to be creepy
---
Because all we wanted was to sell or scrap ammo and this is a very inconvenient way to deal with it
---
My experience on Xbox is everyone does their own thing no matter the level. I've only been playing this mode for 3 days so idk if it's just a fluke but I'm about to just give up. I try to stick near by at least one person but meh idk.
---
Role play series could be interesting, would take time to set up. Two or more people level 50, no quests done, just some basic gear wandering and running through the quests
---
Characters have a 180 item log so just pick up more than that and server hop an you can do it again. But the 3 extractors for 40 each night b better to farm
---
i love just exploring in the fallout games and discovering new locations, trying out builds
---
Because it’s a cult.
---
Those that purchased it last time would then be alienated.
---
YES! Smiley is 100% a Secret Service member in a ridiculous disguise.
---
totally agree on the M1 garand. if they wanted to add a conversion skin for the fixer/cbr perhaps a BAR would be cool too?
---
I'm m not sure I've really seen that on YT much. 
---
If you guys are interesting, I'd easily watch that. ,
---
It would be so nice to hit triangle put all your ammo in ...switch over and take out the three ammo types I actually use....confirm point total...done.
---
What when did she drop this? I have only seen her drops useless stuff
---
Yep and yep Ive seen it more times than I care to. Not to mention the lag delays between objectives in quest screwing you. Just remember its Fo76 and at any point a reward/ event completion can be ripped from your hands and the satans little helper thumbs down boy will be there to rub in that extra salt.
---
For $20 it is good bang for your buck.  If you enjoy Fallout it is 100% worth that entry fee.  I am a bit bored of it and find it a bit tedious but I am also a few hundred hours in.  
---
At launch it wasn't worth the $60 I paid, but would have been happy spending $20.  Since then they have had tons of new content and some fixes.  You will get loads of fun play time before the grind sets in.
---
Love Fallout. Fo2 is probably one of the weaker links in the franchise, but it was a pretty solid evolution. 
---
I just don't like Bethesda's Fallout, like so many others. Well known for bad, lazy writing, disrespect for a lot of what the original games were aiming for - 76 has a different writing team, which is why the story and worldbuilding in 76 are worth a damn.
---
You know I'm just a guy with an opinion, right? You don't have to change my mind. It's cool that you like the steel brotherhood shooting at the bad mutants again and again. I don't mind.
---
It was from completing the Scorched Earth event, not from looting the queen's corpse. I literally never got anything from completing that event other than heavy combat armor until the last update.
---
I’m bloodied and if I see people not taking pylons I just simply take all three, while stiming and kill the sheepsquatch, all solo. While people are laying into her while she is cloaked. I just think it’s funny that people don’t bother to check the actual event description and just sit there doing their own thing. And I’m holding pylons while at max I’m at 25% hp. It’s possible to live while holding pylons, just be ready to spam upwards of 50 supers to live
---
Probably just a fluke, ive played NW since it launched
---
I will say theres more people in NW due to score, but they never last long
---
ooops. sorry. my bad. I was half asleep. But actually I did this quest pretty easy using stealth boy. if u want i will help u with this quest NP. same nickname in the game.
---
Yea good old henny and his free exploit ammo!
---
I bluprinted the ammo factory and made like 10000 rounds an hour pretty cool
---
By not paticipating in the most recent community event.
---
Seemed pretty fast to me. You dont feel that its an improvement?
---
It would briefly flash with the real number when reloading the page repeatedly
---
New stuff is always welcome but how about they work on making the stuff we have viable??
---
Whether it's simple buffs to damage or being more creative with perks and legendary perks.
---
Thats my vote.
---
Although a commando gauss rifle would be cool.
---
I dont
---
I like the dailies she gives but I ended up finding the settler wanderer and just swapped when I rebuilt my camp. HOLY GOD best decision I made yet
---
I only join build teams and I've never actually built anything with anyone. I'm pretty sure everyone is on it for the INT and XP boost. Just start one yourself and eventually ppl will fill
---
While they still count as separate things (the door/window) you can still place brick walls back to back with each other.. You just need to make sure that there are to foundations on either side of the walls you're building, so that they orient right.
---
Sometimes this game is actually good.
---
I thought legendary items aren't shown at all?
---
Join or. Relate a build team. Do what every u want. If you’re gonna run events. Join an event team. Nobody is building in a buikd team we’re all just leveling and taking the intel boost.
---
Also my rr is the Clusterfucker and my gauntlet is Mr Fister, naming things is great. I also named a piece of armor your dick so everytime it broke I got a message that said your dick broke. Ahhh the little things
---
My B fss +1 st rolling pin = BethesdasApex
---
The interface needs to change.
---
It just is a conflict between some fire rates and some legendary modifiers that cause a massive damage spike
---
Least most people haven't been dicks about it. Son's friend dropped one in my camp and I have free ammo on the side of mine. I don't want to move and be locked in budget better to wait for a fix which moves all camps and deletes the ammo factories.
---
Get rid of lone wanderer, get a bunch of mutations and run with strength in numbers, join a team and you will be well ahead of where you were with 3 points to work with. One (more than one is a waste) into crit savvy. Plenty of good advice here where to put the rest.
---
I used to run a building team but event hopping on an event team is faster exp, for me at least.
---
Totally fine. I think most people doing building teams are in it for the xp boost only. I do building teams all time and we rarely interact much besides waving when we happen upon each other in the world.
---
Jokes on you, I got it for 5€.
---
Intelligence increases exp gains, yes. I think it caps out at 25 intelligence but I'm not totally sure. Ideally you want to be in a building team to help hit that cap and then have a team leader change the party type under certain instances.
---
For example if you swap the team to hunting right before killing the SBQ you can double her experience, then swap to events to double that experience, then swap back to building to continue getting a general experience buff off everything as your group wanders around doing their own thing.
---
The best change I can think of to make that a consistent 1 shot would be to use stealth.  If you are opposed to stealth and also junkies/bloodied there's not a whole lot of options to increase your damage.
---
Using an instigating weapon and getting a headshot should ohk all ghouls with that build as it sits.  lever action would be my personal favorite but ymmv.
---
Same thing happened to me but they did give legendary loot
---
Since when can you dismantle legendaries?
---
Regarding the players? Always. F76 has the best playerbase of any game.
---
I never team. The bush gets too crowded.
---
Thankyou! Yeah for some people the game isn’t all about god rolls and pvp min maxing, I’m the same as you, except I have an unhealthy obsession with nuka cola!
---
They are not. But I do not have these items anymore.
---
Relog they should appear and in theory Not compelted
---
Mainly regarding the ammo machine trick 🤣
---
I don't. I hit 100 around 2 weeks ago and never intend to play it again unless if I can squeeze out an easy challenge in less than a full match.
---
This is what I thought.
---
Cool story
---
Are u sure u didn’t watch the end of lethal weapon?
---
The negativity of the game has solid footing. 
---
However for 20$ id say its well worth it bugs and all. You can easily sink 40 hours plus into just casually playing and enjoying it besides you start to notice the major and i mean major flaws.
---
Means absolutely nothing. At this point you should know they lie/change their mind 50% of the time about things.
---
And now *you’re* oversimplifying the stories of FO3 &amp; FO4, lol. 
---
You’ve yet to cite anything from the original that they ‘disrespected’.
---
Haha I like that part in theory :D
---
So just in case I will complete the 4 challenges and then try a relog.
---
No, mods are reduced as well. It's only the 90% reduced legendary modifier on weapons that doesn't include mods. The armour effect absolutely does.
---
Lead is easy. Just hit the lucky hole mine with an excavator pa and smelt the ore. I have a much harder time getting steel in quantity.
---
Good to know. Ty
---
I feel the same way. At least trying to get 1000 donated per day.
---
At least it was free. Yeah it needs work but I'm just glad I didn't have to pay for the damn thing
---
Steel is simple. A rapper and kill enemies
---
FaceRaper = Junkies +33% gauss shotty
---
I do the same for my wife in games and irl. (She's not playing 76... Yet)
---
Yes it's magic, though with a bloodied one it doesn't really matter. It'll one shot with or without VATS. Speaking of which, VATS is wonky with it, but once you get used it it's not so bad. I wouldn't prime it... It's powerful enough as is and you won't be using it on the SBQ. I use the Hardend Receiver, Extended Barrel, Precise Stock, Perforating Magazine, and just the Reflex Sight.
---
Scrapping weapons and armor provides opportunity to learn mod plans.  Also gives you mats.
---
Many of those can either be reutilized, or bulked and sold to bot vendors for caps.
---
Pretty much the same logic for junk items.  Scrap it, use what you can, sell the rest to bots.
---
you can try vendoring some items, which will usually pay more than the bots will.
---
In either case, patience.  caps will come.  I think I was well past L60 before I was able to keep more than about 6k at any given time.
---
You dont need to keep everything;  You will be penalized for trying to carry too much (where penalty = over encumbered, cant fast travel, stash full.)
---
Aid items also sell well at bots.  You really don’t need 300 stimpacks, 200 radaways, and another 100 rad-x’s n your inventory.
---
With a couple of exceptions, you probably dont need more than about 50 of any given item.
---
1. What are you working on now? Trying to complete Patch 22 and mini quest in there to introduce BoS, then BoS big update. Starting planning for 2021 roadmap.
---
2. How's WFH been? WFH like for everyone has been tough. Just time and distractions and communication (i.e. stuff going on around you at home). Literal bandwidth limitations as builds sometimes ~46 GB and people's internet connections can't sustain
---
3. Why WV for setting? Under represented in games and media, cool locations, beautiful terrain, and cryptids / myths / arcana of the region sealed the deal. Lots of weird and unique places like the giant teapot and pumpkin house. Interviewer's favorite place is Helvetia and surprised to find out it's a real place as well. IRL Helvetia now makes masks from the game to include in the real Fastnacht parade. 
---
4. Mod support update or progress? Working on it. Codenamed "Heavy Lift" for the body building lead on it. And is a big effort as well thus the name. Won't be drag and drop like previous FO/TES games due to client-server architecture. But still working on it. No timetable.
---
5. Are we getting more ways to display items in C.A.M.P.? Yes. Working on multiple options - mannequins, further out maybe Power Armor. FO Shelters with doors to instances to display more stuff and with more flexibility. Experimenting with loosening build rules beyond just budget (less snap-to-grid). Can go nuts indoors as don't have to deal with pathing AI or other outdoor factors. 
---
6. Can we expect more character slots (e.g. in context of more C.A.M.P. building)? Maybe. No plans right now. But legendary perks should help. Official Perk loadouts are far out :((( Instanced shelters should help if the desire is more CAMP building with extra character slots.
---
7. How often do you play the game? During lunch breaks or recreationally with colleagues? Yes as part of work. Prefer to play with randos at lunch as we are with coworkers all day. Fun to eavesdrop on player conversations. Also weekly mandatory playtests across the 4 sites. 
---
8. Raiders or Settlers? Both said Raiders.
---
9. What can you tell us about the BoS and the near future? BoS return to Appalachia coming from the West Coast. The OG brotherhood to return to find out what happened and their own mission agenda. What happened in their trek across the states, why they're here. Character-centric. Armor, weapons, not just quests, "lite" allies. Spread out over several batches. 
---
10. Do you have any plans to expand the map out in the future beyond WV region? Always a topic of conversation. Experimenting with one-off missions offsite. Technical hurdles and hopeful to have coming next year with BoS (??) 
---
11. Are you considering making the game Free-to-Play? No the game is doing well. We are on Xbox Gamepass now and FTP weeks for people to try but no plans to make it permanent FTP.
---
12. One Wasteland - what will it mean for boss encounters? Will it still feel challenging? Yes. Lots of tuning knobs to make sure things don't immediately normalize to your level. i.e. maybe SBQ will always be crazy high level, or allow it to come down to a certain floor but not below that. Still plan to have the regions have different challenge ratings. Flexible level "floors". Two things trying to solve: 1) random difficulty spikes like once a level 200 enters a zone and leaves and the level 20 that comes in after has to fight Lvl 62 ghouls. Frustrating. 2) Want players of different levels to play together. Promote public teams even more. 
---
13. C.A.M.P. budget--any plans for increase? Hoping Shelters alleviates that concern. Always trying to optimize it and make it easier/more efficient. Substantive team working on just C.A.M.P. system. Will be solved with Shelters hopefully as its additive budget with what's outside.
---
14. When will we learn the fate of Vault 96 or be able to explore it? Daily ops will bring back Vault 94 as a daily op location. Go through the mission in 94 and will be different from the previous Raids. Unlocking the world location of 94 to go in to explore outside of Raid/Daily Ops context. Would like to do the same thing for 96 in the future.
---
15. What's the weirdest / most exciting thing that you've seen players create? Pretty good list. Brahmin launcher. Murder churches, scavenger hunts, pirate ship on Seneca Rocks. Every week team shares what they find. Constantly surprised by the community.
---
16. If you can be the Mothman for one day what would you do? What would I do IRL? Fun to go to a con. Be a cosplayer and if people wanted to take photos just poof out of there. Before Wastelanders, we wanted the Overseer to be played by devs and hop in to servers and do a type of Mechanical Turk situation to fool players. Went pretty far down that road before scrapping it as there aren't that many players per server and tons of servers.
---
A new currency (ammo points) is a player eroding game killer. It really seems as though the Dev team hates the player base. How about have caps &amp; Faction points. Make all plans in the loot table except faction plans and some special weapon plans that are locked to an event (I.e. Fixer, the best weapon they ever added). Add content with story and progression. A few repeatable events that make sense. Line in the sand, heart of the swamp and so on.. They make sense to repeat. Make the legendary modules usable on weapons and armor via a perk card maybe . I dunno. Really this grind hollow end game is dragging the player base down. The last patch debacle was horrible.  First and foremost .. Play your own game.
---
Because it's pretty crazy to make out like you haven't seen any of the discourse surrounding their blunders with 3 and 4. I guess it's possible, but a bit unlikely that a fallout fan hasn't gotten a whiff of any of this yet. 
---
You'll catch up, probably when you get bored of the BoS shooting more bad mutants in Fallout 5.
---
You should definitely get it just to experience the story like I did. I had a lot of fun through level 60 but after that it really died down, I just ran out of content. But grinding through the story was enjoyable and it was interesting seeing the lore of the game.
---
Each intelligence gives about a 1.7% xp bonus so yes, it isn’t a whole lot but it does do something
---
Well, I'm sure they'd skip that whole "test" part of things, so that would make it easier.
---
The 5.56 was an example, but if it's that easy already, why change it? It's already just a few clicks to convert stuff, so there's really not any need, right?
---
Its helps to make sure you have no active events. If there is cancel them on the pip boy and attempt to join
---
An improvement but not as seamless as it could be. People want better but overall are at least happy it isn't SO slow now.
---
God no.
---
Pretty sure unless Mel Gibson was accompanied by a white female Danny Glover in a hollywood remake.
---
Would not mind it as a crafting table either...
---
And a 2000 ammo credit cap, seriously wtf is that? You're working with integers, how hard is it to +/- from a number, why wrap it in more logic to determine if its &gt; &lt; or === 2000. Most of your guys code is buggy as hell as is, why would you further add jenky @$$ logic to something that can be so much simpler.
---
Cracking idea. To be honest I think this version we currently have is worse than the one before. But your idea is definitely the way it should be
---
Yeah, and scrap the guns. But I feel like I have to kill like tons of enemies to get enough steel to go with all the lead I get from one run of lucky hole.  Like it maybe take 4 times as much time to get steel as it does lead, in my experience.  Where are good locations to farm steel from enemies? Top of the World?
---
Cool, more promises. I've payed for promises and they are giving more of that for free, just like they promised
---
I run bloody commando and keep my bloodied limb Gauss Shotgun on me. Mine and your 33 vats are "magic". You don't need to run any shotgun perks and it's a freaking beast. I use the standard sights, hardened receiver, extended barrel, forceful stock, piercing mag. I'm using the prime receiver now but may switch back to hardened if I run out of flux for ammo. Also tried the aligned stock and didn't notice any difference so I think that's a toss up. Forceful has better durability so keeping that.
---
Thanks bro good advice I noticed learning plans from scraping
---
Weird.  It's happened to me 3 times now and I've never got legendary loot.
---
Varmint rifle
---
Are diseases actually a problem? I've been ignoring them since Fallout 4 survival. Never were enough of a bother to warrant the medicine minigame for me.
---
Never noticed any significant issues from having diseases... Am I missing something?
---
Extended barrel and perforating magazine are a must, Ultracite yes since there is such a small amount of ammo consumption, over about a week of maybe 14-50 hours I go through maybe 2k ammo total for on average. And precise stock. And yes it is magic
---
Did you happen to record or do you have another item to donate to science and post?
---
I overcame it by ignoring diseases... Maybe I am gimping myself?
---
He resets on mondays now.
---
Did he say he was getting to old for all this shit?
---
INHALE 2.. 3.. HOLD.. 2.. 3.. EXHALE....2..3..
---
Incredible!!!
---
I just edited my original statement. I jumped straight on to warn all without actually seeing if the server was lagging.
---
slightly less shit is still shit.
---
Ammo crafting with max ammo smith and super duper equipped plus the ArmCo ammunition construction appliance that you can buy with max raider rep and 750 gold. Not sure about how much 5mm or 308 it puts out but i get about 200 5.56 every hour or so from it. No lead or steel required.
---
Even if auto-completed there has been word you can still do them.
---
Same for me.  Today for the first time though, I checked the score board before entering the game and had my first experience of auto completing the day events.
---
Thanks, and just cause I'm too lazy to look it up, what flux does the 2mm require?
---
Scrap ammo to steel, lead, and gunpowder. Less than what it takes to make the ammo and your done. You have mats to make what you need
---
Oh yeah vats is wonky but if you enter vats, exit and go back into vats it will hit on the first shot. One shots mostly anything, even without shotgun perks.
---
all my good rolls come from the burrows. last good was a B25 lmg
---
I love the data. All data must be loved equally.
---
However, how strong is the time variable here?
---
&gt; It's Bethesda ongoing quest to casualise their game more
---
Thank God. I just want to explore the map and do quests.
---
As long as it doesn't cut into your weed and beer money
---
Need some better handgun options for sure. The deliverer from 4 was my main.
---
We're the duped pics? Sorry man. This happen, the pic thing, to two ppl I know Over 6 months ago. I went in bought a usb stick and save mine since they had their problem.
---
Haha same. I got a BE 50 cal
---
I got all the way to the end, wasted all my ammunition, and the last boss didn’t spawn right so I got nothing
---
It's worth it at $20, to Bethesda's credit they've gone all in, with a planned roadmap over the next year adding new content.
---
I'm a junkies build and have a 3* junkies rolling pin that I saved because I thought it was funny. Bring it on. I'm already ahead of 90% of people.
---
I'm too lazy to look right now also, but it's crimson or cobalt. Can't remember. One of the "C" ones lol.
---
I got three various beers, 2 purified water and a floater nade and left the compound in disappointment.
---
agree with all this! also commando gauss would be sweet. that or some kind of suppressor-viable commando energy wep
---
I’ve seen that. No loot, just a pop up and the noise
---
Once you tag it, it will begin to fly in a circle. Usually, one part of it’s new path it will come close to you. Shoot it with VATS, until you down it. And if you have concentrated fire you can take out the limbs which will down it quicker. Since it’s your first time just be patient with the process and as you successfully take one down the subsequent ones will be easier. Also keep in mind you will be taking continuous fire from the vertibirds but the damage is so light you can almost ignore them and just run away once you’ve attained the keycard
---
As much as I'm sorry for the building community this patch has affected. These posts are getting very stale very quickly.
---
The deliverer from fo4
---
Thanks, and good to know. My son has the mini gun and I give him all the 2mm I find, well at least I used to lol, and that thing is impossible to keep up with the ammo. Boss fights only
---
&gt; Also a fascinating anecdote about how, prior to Wastelanders, they had considered the idea of the Overseer being a developer-controlled character in random worlds. 
---
I'm glad they went against this
---
Voice acting is superb everywhere in this game
---
In before sarcastic comment that this will be through some microtransaction...
---
You poor thing. Bethesda delayed it for a couple of weeks to work on it more
---
I haven’t even built the thing...much simpler to just put in my vendor for 1 cap.
---
Thanks!! I also want suppressors for the revovlvers. Love the .44 and western!!
---
Pretty much what I recommend as well, but the framesets would be divided by material - light wood, light steel, light concrete, heavy wood, heavy steel, heavy reinforced concrete.  The more durable the frame, the more expensive in materials (they'd all have the same render budge) and the more hit points the walls have.  Instead of just wallpapers, I'd have siding as well.  Siding can only be placed on one side of the wall, but it sets the DR value of the wall essentially making it Armor for the wall. Also unlike wallpaper, siding would have a durability cost.
---
One major reason to have the frames be separate objects is builders could choose to apply nothing to them, leaving a skeletal appearance that would be great for making rafter systems in loft ceilings like in the log cabin prebuild.
---
Probably when they do camp instances
---
Thanks for the tip! I'll bring my Excavator power armor for extra protection in case it's too dangerous
---
I took down my first one with a plain old combat rifle.
---
An AA or Troublshooters weapon will do it faster.
---
Once you hit one of the engines and it starts to smoke, the erratic flight path will change, the bot will slow down, and it will get easier to hit.
---
Yes, you have to destroy it.
---
Is there a bat display case?
---
Better criticals is a waste. Crit damage is bonus 50pct of base damage with three points you get 40 pct of that which equals 20pct of base damage- 3 points equals 6.66 damage per point. If every third hit is a critical that equates to 2.22pct damage boost per shot of base damage (before rifleman perks, adrenalin, covert etc.)
---
More than 1 point into Critical Savvy can also be a waste for riflemen. The critical bar on my lever fills after every second shot with only 1 point in it. Guess how many shots it takes to fill with 3 points into crit savvy? The same amount- try it for yourself.
---
Ad Victoriem
---
In the patch notes it said it will be released in the next couple weeks, so hopefully this Tuesday or the next
---
Well, you builders WERE the quietest people in the community. Until this latest patch.  Then you all rose up and very impressively set fire to the world.  Good on you.
---
;)
---
Nope.
---
Yea after relog all challenges are there and auto-completed. But I still get the score points if I do the 5 that were not listed before thanks! (doesn't show up on the display but at the score rank)
---
Better than nothing
---
...and yet, you still chose to click on it, read it, and respond...
---
One of my favourite voice actors in the game.
---
Also you might want to invest in at least 2 ranks of fireproof, otherwise you'll be blowing yourself up quite frequently.
---
The minigun IMO does a massive amount more damage than the shotgun so I keep enough ammo for both, but the shotgun is just so satisfying when you blast your enemies in vats and just see the blue beam of death blast your enemy into tiny pieces. If you have heard about the BE .50 that has a modded beam splitter on it, that beast of a gun can kill the queen in about 20 seconds, I have added two gauss miniguns to my collection that can kill her faster, I’ve been able to take at most 10% chunks of the queens go out at once but not at the scale of my miniguns
---
Go play the sims if your interested in building that much.
---
would be super cool! dumb question but do revolvers have suppressors in real life? i could be wrong but doesnt at least the pipe revolver have a suppressor?? its not as shiny but still can BANG
---
Had this same bug for months made at least 5 tickets and still no fix they have told me to uninstall the game and a bunch of other things but still no fix. Maybe if we all make tickets at Bethesda help we may get it fixed in a few more months.
---
Happened to me when the patch 20 update released. Nothing you can do about it, at least i think there isn't
---

I tend to carry like 3-9k ammo, which is enough for 6 or more queens solo, but I know the pain of the ammo consumption
---
I'll bring The Last Word with me, I hope I'll be fine. Thanks for the tip!
---
It's pretty quick to convert now, but it's a fair point in that it does take an extra few button presses. But you're nearly tripling the output...
---
Not that I heard lol..  
---
Seriously though, i'm not a pvp player, I understand why people do like it, I just don't,  from what i've seen/experienced in game that players have done just while doing the score challenges, turns me of the game even more.  This was so unexpected but seriously cool.
---
I always team. I open my mic in the lobby, and I’m definitely up for a team. If no one bites, i go it alone. Nice to see what’s going on with other folks, and three less people trying to kill me.
---
Is that with Rifle and Pistol perks? They stack for the pipe revolver and the pipe bolt action
---
it's so awesome when you can get the turf war going
---
It's happened at least four times since release for me.  
---
I remember once wanting more space for pictures instead of the higher stash limit. At least now I don't have to pick and choose which photos to delete.
---
The main thing to remember is when you initially tag (shoot) it and it will no longer travel across the map, it will always begin traveling in a circle. It will remain flying in a circle until you’re able to shoot it down
---
Same, just don’t use the jet pack before using VATS.
---
Yes steel was easy, I started farming a few days before the event started by doing some West-Tek runs. Back then nobody cared about steel and in addition to the weapons from super mutants I killed myself there were hundreds of weapons just laying on the ground waiting for me from players doing West-Tek runs for SCORE, XP and legendaries. So I could donate 15k steel on day 1 and then another 8k steel over the week. Got some plans I didn't have, but mostly crap. I still have like 8k plastic on me from all these laser rifles. But I don't think I will donate any more concrete or cork.
---
Psst there’s a workaround for floating walls I found
---
What time and timezone do you know? I'm in Australia and he reset 10am Sunday morning like clockwork since Wastelanders.
---
Ya the pipe revolver does in this game. About the others idk? But it's Fallout, I think we can stretch it!!
---
    2. J3325 Combat Shotgun
---
Naming is a serious thing.
---
I totally agree we need a rebalance 
---
Especially pistols i tried a pistol build for fun and my god is it weak compared to everything else. not saying i should be able to one shot the queen but only way i could even remotely get it enjoyable was a full auto build. same with energy weapons. Iv been loving the ultracite laser gun lately but its just so weak compared to everything else. 
---
As for a commando gauss rifle it was kinda disappointing to learn commandos didn’t get one. Hopefully it was just an oversight and the brotherhood will bring some new toys in.
---
I do pretty well on my own as long as I don't get screwed over  when people spawn in at the beginning.
---
Not really.  If you're bored go craft 100 level 1 bats and scrap them. Statistically speaking you should get all of the bat variants within that span of time.
---
That's incredible
---
I usually start or join a build team.  I dont hop event to event, so the build team bonus suits.
---
If the team is full and the 4x bonus is reached, it’s also very nice to get over 200 XP per ghoul at whitesprings.  Makes the 10k repeatable a lot faster to achieve :)
---
I’ve read many claims, and all have been unfounded. I’ve seen false claims of lore-breaking errors, or misunderstanding about past lore, etc. Nothing concrete or legitimate, especially to someone that looks at the whole picture. 
---
I didn’t ask what *others* had stated as the alleged problems; I asked you for what **you** viewed as problems. Even just one. 
---
The BoS battling Super Mutants isn’t a problem, as long as both have a valid reason to be there.  And that’s never been the primary focus of any of the Fallout RP games. It’s background flavor.  And it’s not the only flavor either. 
---
You choose not to give me an example of what you find as problematic, and instead deflect it to the ‘bandwagon of hate’.  You insist I should know, but can’t support your personal claims. 
---
I do know what some people claim to dislike about Fallout under Bethesda. And so far, it’s been flimsy at best, and outright false in most cases. 
---
Like Jet. I love when that argument comes up, because it essentially means that player decided to believe a drug-addled 17-year old punk that was trying to make himself look indispensable to a criminal family.  And yet, it’s been proven that Myron was a liar. 
---
But Bethesda was such a hack and retconned the history of Jet. Which is laughably incorrect. 
---
If you choose to give me a specific example for us to discuss to support your claims of ‘bad writing’, please do so. Otherwise, have a good day.
---
I didn't know it ever did give a bounty. I don't remember getting a bounty the few times I was first to someone else's drop, and I know for certain that an already unlocked drop has items for every person who comes later.
---
It's not true that you cant do double sided walls anymore, you just cant do it with the door switch method. Still able to do it with the flamethrower method. It's harder and more time consuming but still works. JS
---
It's a rad storm. It happens on occasion. You will take rad damage if you stay outside in it.
---
The only question is does concrete use the same garbage reward table as steel? It’s considerably more difficult to farm and doubt anyone high enough level to focus on it wants the lowbie rewards.
---
&gt;Where are good locations to farm steel from enemies? 
---
Hornwright Testing Site #03 (just south of Vault 63 in Ash Heap).  Basically the, "Lucky Hole mine" for iron ore.  On top of that, there's a Raider and Mole Man camp directly north of it (Sludge Works and Abandoned Mine Shaft 2 IIRC) that also has a workbench so you can easily scrap all the gear you loot from the enemies there.  
---
Bring an Excavator and make a pitstop through there for a couple of days.  All the steel you could ever need.
---
It's a radiation storm. They're just for atmospheric effect but there is a perk that lets you regen HP inside one. They can also make for some really nice screenshots in photo mode.
---
Oh darn
---
And? They wouldn't have to buy it?
---
🤦🏼‍♂️ How could I forget about that gun. Spent so much time with it in new vegas. Running through deathclaw island and destroying the legions camps.
---
So what you're saying is that if we're not bitching about glitching events, load times, and nerfed weapons we have no voice here? And on top of that, if we prefer the building aspect of FO76 we shouldn't be playing it? ...interesting...
---
Then it's easier than I thought, it spawned just next to the Whitespring Bunker and I only had an auto lg, I knew it was impossible to shoot it down with it, the grenade barely made it above the trees nearby
---
I still miss the explosive Thompson from previous iteration of FO.
---
&gt; **Q: How often do you play the game? During lunch breaks or recreationally with colleagues?**
---
A: Yes as part of work. Prefer to play with randos at lunch as we are with coworkers all day. Fun to eavesdrop on player conversations. Also weekly mandatory playtests across the 4 sites.
---
There is no way this is true given the continuously dismal state of this game's (lack of) content, bugs, and features/fixes no one asks for.
---
I also use PA cuz it looks cool lmao
---
true. slap an oil can or something on there!! cheers
---
Not sure. I keep hearing it is and isn't.
---
I named my handmade snipey rifle... it has a reflex sight.
---
[https://imgur.com/gallery/oLqwEUI](https://imgur.com/gallery/oLqwEUI)
---
Damn it's still $20. You should look around online. I got the limited edition version that came in a collectors tin for $10 on Wal-Mart.com last year.
---
Yes and once you tag it you don’t have to run towards it anymore. As it flys in a circle part of its path it will always come very very close to you especially if you’re on relatively flat land
---
Scroll down, there is a dl button.
---
Why you gotta be logical about this?
---
i felt this^
---
Cant wait turn in my 350 for 7 1* Hunter Rolling Pin !
---
Of course we want to know how to do it. Getting onto really high areas is so much fun.
---
Shit needs fixing so they fixed some shit. Try playing the game without using exploits and glitches and this sort of thing is far less of a problem.
---
I’ve gotten there with the secret service jetpack and a springboard, launched from both Tyler co dirt track and Billings homestead multiple times.
---
Sure thing, I gotta learn how to do professional looking video cuts etc etc. For something this cool I wanna make it look good.
---
Hmm, I'm going to have to try that with my sniper loadout. Thanks for the tip. Anything you would recommend to fill the last 2 points?
---
It still requires acid which is harder to come by.
---
Just another quick question: most people launch their nuke near Watoga to fight the Scorchbeast Queen but I'm level 59, I don't think I can kill the monster on my own. Once I can launch my first nuke, where do you think should I launch it?
---
Right? Boooooring. 
---
Oh look. A nice house. I haven't seen 38374 of these before... Oh look for added originality they made the pillar walls aqua made popular.
---
Wow.
---
What system do you play on
---
I wish we had more of them and that the storm Rads could spawn low level creatures to become Glowing varieties of things like Rad rats etc.
---
(With at least some small chance of High Rad fluids to drop!)
---
A naturally occurring nuclear event?
---
PS4
---
I enjoy these they add to the fact we are in a real life ,apocalypse
---
What a horseshit post. Looks like it got downvoted to 0. LOL!
---
Close enough, lol. Thanks again
---
Bloodied thumb tack
---
Consider me reprimanded
---
One event of uranium fever or line in the sand will give you 1000 steel if you scrap loot with scrapper.
---
I only play with my friends. We use psn chat. If I want to play without them, I go solo usually.
---
I much prefer the 'bad' original over the 'improved' version. Yes it has higher exchange number options but how often do I need to sell 100 Nukes, or 600 syringes? 
---
Pages are now cluttered with options you can't/don't want to/rarely use, and all in the tiniest font size with more numbers than you have ammo to exchange. 
---
Increase screen size. It feels like I can see more outside the terminal bezel than inside. The text is squeezed in. It may be perfect for PC users who sit close to the screen but not for consoles using a TV. 
---
Buy and sell should be on separate trees? Why isn't it the very first option? With 100k points you will likley rarely need to buy and sell on the same visit.
---
No 'sell max' option. You still have to do multiple sales if you have odd numbers that don't match the fixed options, annoying if you only just fall short by small amounts. 
---
Why not only show selling options you have ammo for?  If I'm carrying 0 of a type ignore it, or if I have less than the minimum requirements.
---
I was going to say no since it can be had for about 1/3 of that used, or in some cases free as part of bundles but for PC it may not be found much cheaper except a handful of times per year. As much as I enjoy it I’d say 20 is the top limit of what someone should pay for this.
---
Since you already really like Fallout then I’d recommend it. It really shines during multiplayer though (I mean co-op, not PVP). If someone had no Fallout experience already then I’d not recommend it tbh.
---
 It does not cap out. Once you clear 60 int, every two points gives you the same value that 1 extra point would give you if your intelligence was lower than 60. 
---
I'm basing this on personal experience, not hearsay.
---
All done
---
Since that wendigo wasn't doing much damage to scorchbeast i guess it would have been a long fight.
---
Oh yeah , and loot bags , another thing I’ve noticed recently , if I open my map the second I load in , I get that pop up you get after you make a new character , asking me if I want to buy a player icon
---
😂🤣😂 cause my base was nuked and I didn't take my own advice. 🤦
---
I think they mean you'd at least try to cover it with cloth or wood or something to keep the bugs and murderers out
---
They’re build teams but you can’t actually build in anyone’s camp in public teams. It was a poor choice to call it building.
---
Thanks, this I would not have figured out for sure
---
 Every little bit helps.  At night time the sentry bots at whitespring give me over 2500 xp a piece.
---
? I get free mods for Xbox for Skyrim and fallout 4
---
I play on Xbox and I play solo most of the time. I don’t know how it is on PS4 but right before I launch the nuke I make a post on the XBOX fallout 76 Looking For Group that I’m about to nuke the queen and I invite all players to join my world on my gamertag. I don’t know if PS4 has something similar. If not, here’s what I suggest. Nuke the queen anyways. You might have enough high levels that will join the event with you. Send a direct message to high levels you see in the world and let them know what you’re about to do and invite friends. Or just launch the nuke and go down there. You might be surprised at how many show up. But definitely look at the map first before you go into the silo. Look for a good number of high level players. Focus on getting through the silo first if it’s your first time. Watch a few YouTube videos on how to clear out the silo and launch the nuke. It took me more than one try to figure it out my first time
---
It happens with my TSE lever and my Gauss shotgun. E.g. I’m holding my lever I hit left d pad and pull out my previous weapon (all good) then if I want to Go Back To My lever I hit left d pad again and get my fists. Then I use the up d pad to just equip the weapon I want and am hit with a huge lag spike and die to poison or fire. Really frustrating that it’s been more than 8 months and I still have not seen a fix. Made multiple tickets and have done everything they tell me to do and have still not had a fix.
---
Someone told me that they tried to fast travel and they got the fast travel bug,if it's true they got a taste of their own medicine, i hope they enjoyed.
---
I’m 10
---
They wouldn't have even shown on a scrap bench.
---
Yeah I've learned this the hard way with a BE handmade. Used to run a dense torso, but now I'm hooked on that jet pack! So perk cards it is
---
Chems sell for a good price, hit all the hospital places. Silver scraps and gold scraps, super duper perk card and bulk scrap then sell it. That's what I do and I can clean out a vendor of caps in an hour or two
---
Except this isn't a single player game it is a multiplayer game and if you can kill the final boss to the point where no one gets credit except for you there is something wrong with the build
---
Water purifiers. Sell the water. (get a fusion reactor and build as many as you can.) Sell drugs you dont need. Do events. After level 50 it gets a lot easier.
---
Build water purification things and sell the water to a vendor or just kill mobs and sell the items you get..but the max caps you get a day from selling stuff is 1500... That's from when I last played a few months back.. Not sure if its changed.
---
Ha. 120 concrete over 72 minutes. Also provided the server wasn't picked clean and one looted 180 world spawns to have them reset.
---
I'm pretty curious about the first day of the Concrete donations (my prediction: less than 1m).
---
That Gun!
---
So how many steel does a single round of 5mm break down into?
---
they may find a way to do it, they are bethesda after all
---
Thats cool just looking to help as thats the only enjoyment I get from Fo76 lately.
---
Dupers are our only hope.
---
When i didn't have much caps i usually just bulked some junk and sold those to vendors. Also any chems etc which you dont use can be sold. You didn't mention your level but maybe run around West-tek or any other place where enemies drop a lot of weapons and then go to sell those for nearest vendor.
---
And remember to equip Hard bargain perk when you are selling! You will get better price.
---
The purpose of that is so people buy it right there and then. Not so you can buy it again a few months from now. 
---
It’s basically done so you feel forced to buy it right there and then. Or risk missing out on a deal. 
---
If they brought it back now, it would be like a FU to the face for the people that bought the “limited edition” outfit.
---
Lmao
---
Sell cooked food, chems, extra meds, glowing blood, etc. to the vendors for 1400 caps a day. Some folks do things like craft marine tactical helmets since they’re cheap to make and sell for decent caps. Use the Hard Bargain perk and grape mentats to get the best selling prices. Glowing meat steaks add up fast.
---
If anyone was looking for the stupidest person in the thread, here's at least one contender.
---
Reminds me of the Anthem streams.
---
Yes, that is with both perk kinds stacking.
---
1400 Caps per day selling crap to Vendor Bots. You'll make a decent profit from selling popular Ammo in your own Vendor for 1c each, 556, 45 etc.
---
None of the tougher questions that needed asking, but I wasn’t holding out much hope.
---
Great photo. That little rad storm is trying its best.
---
Why not both? There'll be plenty of cork after all.
---
I believe they'd work like the ones in the Nucular Silo's and the Bunker Buster Quest when going into the Enclave Bunker where you can't Power Armor glitch your way through..
---
You know that's a glitch that could be fixed now that you mentioned it..
---
&gt;Bonus: There was an idea before Wastelanders was a thing, allowing a dev to run around and become the Overseer as a rare sighting, sort of like Herobrine in MC.
---
I guess they've messed up and used Ward instead  
---
Thanks for the post!
---
Well there's a community I recently joined, I can ask for help there to lower the risks of getting eaten by a giant mutated bat and perhaps add players to to my friendlist. Thanks again for sharing your wisdom, I greatly appreciate your kindness. Ad Victoriam, Soldier! Or long live the Enclave! Or whatever faction you like the most
---
Did you check Watoga station and super duper mart in watoga? That’s where I found mine
---
There's a text chat?
---
Seems like a remnant of the legendary enemies not dropping loot bug--they're now properly marked but still functioning as legendaries.
---
Might as well its more than $20 value just dont invest to much as we are still on a tight rope and the cord could break at any point.
---
It would take all of an hour tops for someone to start a thread about how they accidentally scrapped ALL of their primary ammo and customer support is refusing to refund it all to their character.
---
If you can one-shot the boss you're doing everything *right* with your build. Like I said, switch your build if you hate it so much. Nobody is forcing you to be bloodied.
---
Why not engage? I typically skip all the complaints but every now and then I comment. Cause I can.
---
One last question, which I guess applies to all scoped weapons. Does the added "accuracy" from adding a scope effect VATS? I only ask because you mentioned the reflex sight, which is all I ever use, but I see there's a scope option for the Gauss shotgun
---
NO REGERTS!!!
---
If you have crap legendaries. Sell them in your vending machine (if you have one) for their scrip value (20-25c per scrip). Sell weapons you pick up from mobs and sell purified water to vendors. Max out your daily 1400cap limit all the time. Use Travel agent when you FT (every little bit helps IMO). 😬
---
Next you'll just see ward around every corner
---
PC sadly, but I appreciate it!
---
Just put on Excavator and went from 280/315 to 485/315 , so I may need to find a way to ditch some junk. Or finally craft that stealth suit.
---
Ok I was going to say I would trade it with you but I’m pretty sure I made another comment after I saw you said ps4
---
Sell ammo 556 45 fuel 308, and bloodied and junkies weapons
---
OH 😂 yeah that is impressive. They took our walls but not our ammunition!
---
Water

I'm been meaning to check this out. Do enough people use it?
---
I belong to the order of the Lone Dovahkiin. There’s just one member in the club
---
DEMON
---
Yeah, both duds but I'll hop servers and look again.
---
I hate talking in games due to harassment and also hating my voice but this community so far hasn't let me down. It's such a wholesome community for a game that honestly doesn't deserve it imo (but I'm glad it does). This game is a mess and I love it so much and the community.
---
Exploits have been a staple of Bethesda games for years. Without them, it wouldn't be complete.
---
What is one of the most fundamental things most if not all duping exploits end up having in common?  Moving items in and out of containers, whether they're stash boxes, world containers, vending machines, displays etc.
---
They took containers out of the equation entirely here so there's zero chance of any "traditional" duping exploits involving the ammo converter.
---
The "builders" who are all up in arms generally make generic, boring houses.
---
Or try to imitate the house builds they see on youtube
---
If glitches make or break your camp? It was never that interesting to start with.
---
But thats the entire purpose of a business model like this. FOMO is valuable as a means of double dipping. You get everyone who is afraid to miss out on it the first time, and then re-release it the next time a relevant event is happening. The people who are mad already paid their price, and the people who missed out pay up in because they're promised that this is last time it will be available and then the cycle repeats. While I think the actual devs making this game care about it, no one in marketing or monetization gives a single solitary fuck about anyone who enjoys this game and thats been obvious since day 1.
---
There are a lot of ways to make and/or save caps.  Here is what I think the best ways are, in no particular order.
---
1. Sell to vendors for the 1400 cap daily limit. This is really easy when an event like Uranium Fever pops up. Tag everything, pick up everything, waddle to the nearest vendor and sell everything.
---
2. Keep vending machines in your camp fully stocked with a variety of items like chems, extra plans, ammo at 1 cap each, legendary weapons you don't want or can't trade in. Keep in mind, if its a junk 3 star weapon, you'll only be able to sell it really cheap.
---
3. Stop fast traveling so much, especially if you're having trouble getting the 1400 cap sale limit. You'll run into a lot of things to kill and loot by walking. Join a public team, and see if one of your teammates has a camp or tent near your destination. Then fast travel is free.
---
4. Do the manhunt event that pops up. You'll have to look for it at the Grafton dam. It awards 120 caps, takes 5 minutes, and more weapons to sell for the 1400 limit.
---
5. Kill the enemies at unowned workshops. You'll get 20 caps, and you don't have to claim it.
---
I'm sure others will pipe in with more, but its pretty easy to get to 30k caps with a bit of effort.
---
the only question is, when are instanced Camps going to arrive?
---
I will believe it when I see it. 
---
NOT BEFORE.
---
Because legendaries are the only item worth chasing.  
---
What else would people ask for?  Caps?  Stims?  Chems?  40mm grenades?
---
I did the same and it's the best solution. If you don't get addicted to the Jetpack too much!
---
Also, I couldn't bring myself to scrap a perfect Weightless - AP regen - Weapon weights reduced piece.
---
Wait i hadn't heard anything about that, really?
---
Except that I won't get credit for the final boss if I don't use one this isn't fallout 4 this is a multiplayer game if in a game like wow you could just one shot the raid boss that build would be completely removed
---
Consider yourself the legs of your order because if you leave, no one will be here to carry your heritage anymore
---
I know the Morgantown event does not sure about the normal ones
---
Right? That was pretty nice of him lol 
---
Exploits like these are great when used in moderation. Its part of the charm of a Bethesda game. 
---
And having more ammunition isn't as game breaking or crazy overpowered as other exploits.
---
search Youtube for 'asylum uniforms fallout 76' 
---
I had no problem making money before i started hunting for a red but if you're lucky you can make a poop load
---
Kind of ironic that when people spend the majority of their time in this sub screaming about how buggy/laggy the game is they can't stop freaking the fuck out about how Bethesda removed a bug that was lagging the game because it was a lag inducing bug they liked.
---
Yup an exciting new way to create with your bunker, of course better bunker designs will become
---
1. Fallout 1st Items
---
2. Available in the Atomic store.
---
That's not fun though. What you're saying is "color in the lines". That's boring. Exploits are fun.
---
I’ve sided with both. Had more fun with raiders.  They just had more personality, that I preferred.
---
It depends on the people you’re on a team with, I have a set landing location in Morgantown, I always land there, but if the three other people land somewhere else, I move. But a lot of the time, they land on me, and when they do those are the best games I have, 10+ kills and a win, it’s all about who you get, it’s a fun game mode, that’s why I play btw
---
If you're on PC, I can give you for free plan for marine helmet, if you don't have it yet.  
---
It's easy to craft and with enough charisma/perks you may sell 1 helmet 30+ caps.  
---
Just use super duper while crafting.
---
Shhhhh, this would be too easy.
---
Here is some clips from that interview:

I have three characters that I switch between: one makes and sells marine wetsuit helmets and treasure hunter hats, one sells all of the chems/stims/grenades they find, and the other is a scavver who gathers caps from containers and stashes in the world. The first two also have themed CAMP shops (which seems to make a bit more than when I leave the stores generic and filled with common gear and drops); the scavver is poor, but also doesn't buy anything
---
I see Ward in my sleep....And I’m not talking about in game😳
---
"just"
---
They have been given free passes before, and are simply attempting the same thing again.
---
Launch it there. Others will help as long as you place the nuke in a good spot. Enough to cover fissure site prime but leave the drop site or other fast travel spots open. If you nuke it they will come.
---
If you know the plan for the Marine Tactical Helmet you can craft these. 
---
Each one needs 3 rubber, 1 plastic, and 1 glass shard. Super-super perk can proc to create another helmet. 
---
Max charisma and you can sell these to a vendor bot for around 30-37 caps each. It will only take around 37-47 to max the vendor caps of 1400.
---
Shut up and take my money!
---
The thompson submachine gun is in the game. Didnt know if you knew that or not. Explosive legendary variations of it can be found by mumbles or off random legendary. I Had one for a long time until i upgraded.  Occasionally i see them for sale but i think most end up scrip because everyone wants fixers or handmades.its just no where good as spray n pray was for some reason. Probably due to the explosive damage nerf.
---
Sorry I didn't really read that, but I think you're wrong.
---
The same happened with me and the wooden panelling from the atom shop.
---
I have a feeling A LOT of people will end up disappointed with the bunkers.
---
Will the rewards from vault 94 go back to the dungeon or will they stay gold bullion items?
---
It just makes most sense to me, crafting is the only bit of the interface that doesn't shit the bed with lots of options
---
Ooooh, weightless AP regen is fantastic for a jetpack!!
---
I die...a lot.  I’ve not got acrobat or bird bones.
---
Is the fixer plan among them if not it's not worth it other than maybe the caps But concrete is just way to rare
---
Fair enough.  thanks for the explanation
---
Displaying power armor sounds awesome. Too bad I don't have the budget to spare.
---
So because you never experienced it, it doesn’t exist?
---
Also, have you updated the SFE? It needs to be updated after each patch.
---
A Colt 1911 would be awesome as a end game viable pistol
---
probably busy helping other players
---
Doesn't say anything about time in the patch notes but I assume they just moved the day and the time stays the same.
---
I don't know where you are from but game pass can be had for 1$/1€ for the first month, includes 76 and a fuckton of other games. Don't know if bethesda has account linking set up for it though in case you decide to switch to steam.
---
Plenty of exploits that don't require containers. That premise is flawed
---
according to roadmap it's winter buy that could change
---
Literally the dumbest shit I’ve ever heard regarding this game. Why would you not want unlimited stash?
---
That happened to me a couple of months back, still annoyed at it. Had some great loading screen pictures.
---
Remember the AWESOME stuff we got from the reward table during last years community goals?  Oh, nothing?  Because they didn't exist and people just contributed to the effort for the sake of the community rewards?  Thought so.
---
Pretty sure this is only getting downvoted by the epic redditors who are all about that Fortnite bad Minecraft good life. Fortnite is highly successful, polished and popular. Nuclear Winter is none of those things, so yes it would wish it was them.
---
Every game ever
---
It's not just floating walls, there are many structure types the are impossible to recreate now.  The removal of our ability to snap wall to roof tiles in limited circumstances allowed so much flexibility, but that's is only one of the many build types that can't be with the new system
---
As others have mentioned water purifiers. I have 3 large purifiers in my camp, that's 15 water every few minutes. 
---
If you have the Butcher's Bounty you get extra meat, then cook with Super Duper and sell all that cooked glowing meat. 
---
Sell your unused meds. I get by using only Mentants so I sell every other chem I don't use.
---
Finally, hit up Whitesprings for golf outfits and Fort Defiance for Straight jackets. Always equip your CHR cards when you sell to a vendor.
---
Yeah maybe. Also didn’t know it was 4 dev sites. Thought it was just Austin and Bethesda, MD. That alone leads a lot to one hand not knowing what the other 3 hands are doing.
---
3 less players to worry about and its super easy to get in the top 10 just camping in a bush with nothing so if I get killed no one gets **ANYTHING**.
---
the "shelters" seem to be the main way they are going to handle camp space -  they'll be instanced and have massive budgets and probably will be expandable as well - or so they said
---
It's all fun and games until a scorchbeast flies over and kills your dog then you have to go John Wick
---
I guess it's because most bats are nocturnal....I'll see myself out now.
---
&gt; They're currently developing a way for us to leave Appalachia with some  "fantastic" areas across America (Expeditions?), which they called fan  service and some spots we haven't been to.  
---
&gt;Daily Ops will re-introduce  Vault 94 as a daily location. It's a very different experience than the  old version, but it's "really fun". 
---
you have my excitement now, especially with 94 reopening
---
Bring back the Chinese pistol, or the auto axe!
---
Now that would have been cool...
---
The cap is 100,000.
---
It's an awesome idea they just made it horribly slow....It could have been a much easier and quicker transaction.....Hell I tried to use one after the new update and got stuck in the menu screen and took forever to let me out of it no matter how many times I pressed b
---
Bullshit. I run PA Heavy Gunner and I fucked up the build switching it around, yet I'm still able to get credit for SBQ. You're literally just ignoring the fact that you can change your build and *not* run this overpowered build that you're pissing and moaning about. If I can use a Plasma Caster with shit effects and get kill credit, you can do the same with better.
---
My RNG gives me vanguard +1 lick from the queen. Every.Fucking.Time.
---
It seems like you set that build up mostly for scavenging, but that will make it really rough in combat as you've found out.
---
You're not running any weapon buff cards. Use at least the 3 rank 1 commando cards for your fixer. That's a 30% buff that multiplies with sneak bonus hits. That's a lot less ammo you'll be burning through. Drop concentrated fire to rank 2 and drop the magazine finder perk (magazine buffs are not worth it and you'll find enough of them once you know the spawns anyway) and drop fire in the hole. If you really want to sacrifice a commando card for a grenade card at least use the one that increases the area of explosion instead of the throwing arc/distance card. That way you're hitting multiple enemies more often even if it bounces after the throw.
---
Instead of aquagirl consider using a lead lined backpack because it drops your rads in water to almost nothing. Use a rank of fireproof there instead.
---
Drop lucky break and all the other weapon and armor condition perks. They're not worth it. Repairing slightly more often and carrying multiple primary weapons is easier and won't eat the special points you need for better perks. You've been running a scavengers build so I'm assuming you have a ton of junk. To keep weapons from degrading faster try to avoid using explosives in close quarters because it degrades your own equipped weapons and armor.
---
When you repair swap cards out for the 200% repair cards (if you're on PC there's a mod to save card loadouts called perk loadout manager, it's safe to use).
---
 In luck use rank 3 grim reapers sprint with the points you freed up and drop action girl to rank 1 (or entirely if you grab some AP recharge armor). Use automatic receiver commando weapons (combat rifle, fixer, handmade, assault rifle) modded with reflex/dot sights and quick mags because they eat a LOT less AP than other attachments. 
---
Drop demo expert to level 1. Beyond level 1 it's gains are extremely diminished, especially if you're using it to buff a gun with explosive legendary effect, and if using it for grenades you won't need it as much if you're using the larger explosion area perk. I wouldn't build around using grenades though if you're not using adrenal reaction, because grenades are really not well balanced in this game and they're weak even in the best case scenario build.
---
I know you said the high INT is the character, but instead of a high base INT consider making berry mentats for a +5 int and using rank some ranks of chemist to keep them going longer (despite not mentioning it, chemist perk also helps stimpacks and radaway by making them apply their healing/rad removal effect for longer, and healing more and removing more rads by doing so).
---
Also in CHR consider swapping out HB3 for something else while you're not at a vendor. Use something like tenderizer or suppressor that will help with damage incoming or outgoing.
---
 You can try running serendipity on your build too, even though that's usually for low health builds, because I imagine you end up at low health a lot anyway and it would be a good last line of defense before getting downed.
---
One rule in general though that you can apply to most perks is that most cards diminish their returns with more ranks of the same card. So with few exceptions you only want to run one rank of a card and not rank it up. Bloody mess is an exception, and so is serendipity.
---
Sorry if this is a bit of a mess and has some gaps in it, I am trying to tile a bathroom right now and just threw this together quickly.
---
Then I'll do that as soon as I get the nuclear launch codes. We'll build back America but first, let's just destroy it a bit more
---
Lincoln Repeater
---
lemme turn in 10 for even just *one* guaranteed non-legendary radium rifle
---
All the time. I use the lying out pose to further melt into the background. Peeta in The Hunger Games is my hero 🤣
---
Can other players visit them? I really enjoy wandering around other peoples camps and seeing the items they choose to display. Sometimes it's really funny (plungers) or unique stuff.
---
Low levels: Mass produce water and sell drugs and booze. 
---
Mid to high levels? I sell Treasure maps and mass ammo at my vendor. Weapon and armour sales are meh if you don't have meta gear to sell. 
---
But ammo, drugs and treasure maps sell reliably. For ammo usually 45, 5.56, and 50 cal for me
---
achievements you “earned” in beta don’t count. You will have to start a new character. 
---
Also, some achievements are just bugged for most players.
---
Nor will your bitching and moaning about the people at upset by this.
---
My wife's character still has him show up. The perk is rank 2 I believe.
---
Yup. Had to run a second character to lvl 10 to get the last of them
---
Instantly the WKUK PCP skit comes to mind. Lmaooo
---
Drywall Missle - powerfist
---
Hans Moleman - mole miner gauntlet

Finger Blast - meat hook

Quad City DJ - railway rifle

Unstable Monster - DCG

Tom Hardy voice: "Et's a fockin' rollin' pin!"
---
there are baseball bat paints that you can't learn through scrapping *or* plan, though, which I think is their point.
---
I tried to blueprint it and it wouldn't let me. Does this only work on one that hasn't already been placed? I want to try it on a private server for plasma ammo
---
I recently talked to someone else on here about this, and potentials for mods.
---
It could be a temporary way to raise dr/er, but at the cost of only being able to use one handed weapons and no VATS.
---
Mods could be a spotlight that draws aggro; stun coils that'll stagger enemies; ultralight, pneumatic, and dense that do the same as the armor mods; maybe an expandable one that can block a larger area but only while stationary.
---
Seems like it'd make one-handed weapons more viable, as well as medic/support builds, especially if they nerf bloody builds to be actual glass cannons, shield wielders could be very important for protection in events.
---
Some related perks could be "shield weild" for an AOE increase to movement speed and resistances for with a shield equipped, "bubble boy" to increase AOE rad and disease resist with a shield equipped, "phalanx" where AOE damage and resistance increases if two or more players nearby have shields equipped.
---
I believe you have to be in the console's main menu to load holotapes.
---
Yeah and you clearly haven't run into someone with a full stealth bloody build I've seen them kill the scorchbeast pretty much before It can even land and please tell me how you can get credit with a melee build if the scorchbeast doesn't even get a chance to land
---
That and Julie on the radio
---
It has now moved onto concrete for the next few days, then cork.  The first challenge was smashed so you will get the reward.  The entire community does :)
---
Yeah there's no option for it it just gives me two options but no load holotape one
---
It's now concrete I believe. You donate at Atlas observatory
---
Now I want them to add a wendigo in a clown costume named Gacey to the world spawn as a rare encounter, like the baby megasloth
---
Yup hence why I didn't even respond. Haters gonna hate
---
The devs seemed very uncertain about the “expeditions” feature, especially that it’s supposed to come out in four months. Don’t be surprised if it ends up being delayed. Otherwise, really excited.
---
We will still have the stash space issue. I've been dumping my extra power armor sets down to an alt so I can go visit them when displays become a thing. As I am finishing up my T-65 there just isn't much reason to keep anything else beyond my excavator for mining and strangler heart because you can't transfer it.
---
Hopefully he is ok and was not killed by Ward....
---
LOL, what a sour man, A glitch didn't make or brake the camp.  The glitch was a tool to do neat tricks and build otherwise not possible structures. its's cool also how you haved checked everyone who is complaining CAMPS  and foun out that they mostly do generic boring houses. Must have taken a long time.
---
[](/dashfan)I would buy a Paradigm pack in a heartbeat, serrated spoon skin for the combat knife, The Cone^(tm) helmet, and Horoshi's Corner vendor skin.
---
Yep, sure sounds like it!
---
Yea, offhand objects of all kinds get floated. Would be cool. There are all sorts of really specific exotic options that could be implemented well.
---
Only thing I can think about right now is how in the unloving hell am I going to hit those 92 missing levels to unlock my 6th perk card slot and how in the unoly hell am I going to get to level 800-1200 max out the 3 primay perks I want p,.,q
---
Why yes, it's on page 5 of the bush wookie guide!
---
&gt; COVID impacted their schedule for this year but they adapted quickly, expect some content delays though.
---
Tbh this was already happening regularly before the pandemic. Good to hear they're adapting though
---
Not you again lol. I’m not sure how you really justify saying new content should have no decent rewards because a year ago it didn’t either. It’s the missed opportunity of some cool BoS themed items that let most people down.
---
Yea, thats kind of why I used the word most in there, otherwise I would have said 100% of all past present and future duping exploits or something... but I didn't...
---
Just because they can't avoid all duping exploits for all things doesn't mean they shouldn't take necessary measures to make sure that new things they're adding into the game can't be abused.  Thanks to the interface system the ammo converter is likely dupe-proof.
---
To be fair, I'm around level 90.
---
Maybe sell them. I do, and there are always willing buyers. 😁
---
I had the mysterious saviour turn up when I'm low health and start slapping enemies then walking around.  Like I'm not dead yet mate!
---
I can sell the plans for more than that.
---
I’m thinking this is going to be another one of those this isn’t what we asked for moments. People want more freedom to build. I don’t see how you can achieve this inside a bunker. Seems just as restrictive.
---
How much you looking for
---
oh to see Gacey just chillin in the treetops
---
For me , 20% of the time the team i get placed in works togeather from the start, 50% of the time i meet up with at least one member and work with him   and then 30% of the time i have no contact with the team
---
I one shot sniped some dude in marine armor today during my 10 minutes thanks to photo mode. I may hide in a bush but that doesn't mean I wont take people down when the chance arises.
---
I thought you had to pay Todd for the pleasure
---
They’re having the other studios (besides Austin) helping out with some of the features, I’m sure they’ll manage!
---
Selling radaway and meat. Whem I'm hungry, I just cook some razor grain soup.
---
I posted a thread asking for some examples. 
---
1 person had decent reasons. No one else had anything.....
---
Not to mention I've visited 100's of camps. I'm a shopper..... 
---
90% of builds are boring houses. Oh wow, you have wall paper on the outside too.... Amazing. 
---
Your six room house interior decorated to look like a six room house isn't interesting. If your camp is one big building, it's likely boring. The exceptions are builders like Aqua. 
---
People can feel free to show off their builds, that are so much more interesting because they used these tricks. I gladly watch camp walkthroughs.
---
Sided with settlets. And no im not happy. Reasoning is because Ward can't sit in a chair properly and constantly looses the same items every few days
---
That will be amazing, I can't wait!
---
Thats awful mate. What about an epic camp build to keep you going?
---
We're all in it for the XP boost from the added intelligence.
---
I’m learning the life. Just found out that turning off “Depth of Field” in PhotoMode helps with the resolution when looking out into the distance.
---
I've been watching Grounded previews lately. I know very different but interesting.
---
im definitly staying realistic about expeditions and 94's re-release and delay's, especially with the recent legendary perk and  problem being delayed.  but anything that is tailored toward end game gets me excited
---
Sorry I play on ps4
---
Yes it makes no sense to me. I downvoted my post also.
---
Yep, VATS has been bugged for awhile. Range has the issue as well I believe but it’s easier to tell in pve with melee since we’re always attacking at 95% chance.
---
I got a 1* Hunter's Sickle.
---
I'm on xbox. Assault Rifle is also invisible on wall display.
---
Yeah it happens alot tbh it's frustrating as hell especially as a bloodied build, today I hit a robobrain 4 times with the DCG and it did nothing and almost destroyed me.
---
For that price you'd better get 2, you're going to need them (I have). Especially, if you want to play solo, because the stash box has limited space. There's also no real safe way to transfer stuff between characters if you don't have a couple friends you play with, and trust. Eventually you will get to a point where playing with teams is the only way to experience all of the content, but I soloed my main until lvl 60. It's a very different kind of Fallout in comparison, so if you pull the trigger on it keep your expectations low. I have 1000+ hours in, and I can still hardly put it down.
---
Apparently the event caused server wide lag crippling whenever it activated, so they delayed it so they ould fix that issue before it goes live. Given how pissed we are at the game in general, its a smart move to avoid further backlash.
---
I also have a lot of time, so sure, but just not today
---
Offensive stealth Bush Wookie warfare is OP. You almost always make it to the end
---
A good opportunity to give people BoS themed items would probably be... oh, I don't know... during any of the upcoming updates that are actually going to be themed entirely around the BoS?
---
Or maybe you could be happy with the BoS beret, fatigues, sign post, collectron etc.  Or are those not special enough because everyone gets them and you can't horde plans to sell for tens of thousands of caps?
---
I had to do it in 2 matches, you should recognize your bushy mates

Gt: Bandos Exile
---
For the cargo bot, nothing to be afraid of there, just know that the escorts will turn hostile and shoot you. Use Nukacrypt for the codes unless you want to be authentic and decode, but that’s a pain. Launch away. If I could get online (PS4 too) I’d join you, but I assure you that others will join. I always check the public teams to see the server experience level is though. Good luck.
---
Wow I just used another 2k caps just to die and get glitched out and not respawn and we completed the event
---
I have 3 suits of PA that I switch between. I would love to have a display for the 2 I'm not using.
---
Electrically Charged doesn't proc for PvP things anymore.
---
Yeah, but even without VATS
---
And some of us are the creators of those YouTube builds who are simply unhappy with a recent change. 
---
...that's okay, right? Or am I risking being Cersei Lannister'ed through the FO Reddit community?
---
"Shame, shame, shame"
---
...as an Energy Weapon user, I thank you for this.
---
Thank you! I really appreciate it.
---
So after coming back to this, I wonder if any of the stuff got left out of the score images are next seasons rewards, they match up with Arma race theme it sounded lile announced yestersay. Although the camouflage ss armor paint was just ATX items. So they could come to the shop instead.
---
Log out, log back in. Analyse the blood sample on the terminal then pop the T fuse in 🤘🏼 I literally just had this and it worked a treat
---
Ty for letting me know, it was a pain when it did!
---
I AM MOIST. Boys if they can pull this off I will actually start to respect the dev team. Holy shit please guys get this right. AND DONT MAKE THE BLOODY DISPLAYS ATOM STORE PLEASE. God this looks so good.
---
Well I don't downvote posts unless your a troll so there is no need for all of that.
---
I haven't investigated this far... I do gotta say I get tons of shovels for my rifle build. Lol
---
Melee is the most useless build in the game, it's their own fault for using it. That's literally bringing a knife to a gunfight. Listen, if you're done wasting my time going in circles with flawed logic let me know. If not, then we can keep going. Long story short: Don't bitch about the build *you chose to play* when it's overpowered. Want to be a nice dude and let people kill the thing? Use a melee build with benchmades. Now if you excuse me, I'll be working on my Sentinel Assassin's Bloodied/Junkies build.
---
Do we claim each reward one at a time or all of them at the end of the event?
---
I think the normal ones are ~25 USD sometimes more.
---
Yea, after 50.  These are just a waste of time and ammo.
---
I just got the key card now I'm gonna go on a nuclear code hunt. Thank you for your help!
---
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
We definitely need more storage..or stop making everything weigh so much. As examples Inert Flux and Purified Water are way too heavy.
---
Former leader of the Gourmands....
---
Absolutely. If you actually collect gear and wear marine armor while moving around then switch back to the ghillie suit when you reach a good hiding spot that thing is incredibly good for it's RL purpose. People walk through my bush all the time, never see me, then get a lever rifle bullet in the back of the head after they're out of my safe zone. And if it's an organized group I can just leave them be, no sense in getting myself killed just for 20 XP.
---
I like hiding in bushes with the strongest melee weapon I can get and smacking people as they go by.
---
yeah it's sad but they already explained why
---
move on people
---
at least complain about something new like the weapon getting stuck in the aim animation and you can't do nothing
---
Why's that?
---
Yeah, we'll see.
---
Hopefully they make some worthwhile npc's in the BOS update.  The only npc the game added that didn't make me wanna nuke them was weasel.  Happy I sided with the raiders just for her.  Paige and ward can fall in a pile of Sierra bravo dung for all i care.
---
Raiders. Been happy! Settlers have good stuff, but finally rep lvl munitions machine from raiders was better!
---
Raiders had more depth to their storyline with every character having their own personal goals. Settlers characters did too but it always felt like each person you met would start off with an interesting backstory and then it’d just get thrown under the rug for the sake of finding gold, despite never being resolved.
---
Settlers is just a little too much friendship and unicorns while raiders, despite not being as dark as former raider gangs in Fallout, actually have depth to their faction as well as each person that’s apart of it.
---
Nope definitely not. Twas an awful feeling you just destroyed your best stuff you spent scrip/ got lucky with. Just an instant "warn others" instinct or moment I suppose. I'd hate that to happen to anyone, regardless of the bugs in the game.
---
ouch, i bet he was like "W.T.F.???????"
---
Hehehe, it's a rad storm. I seldom see them anymore but love the atmosphere
---
... you mean Nev Vegas?
---
GT: dydamas. I'm on most nights.
---
The ammo converter is such a broken piece of garbage. I'd rather them fix it first.
---
And you're clearly just selfish this is an MMO it is not a single player game if a single build can make it to other builds do not get credit it needs to be removed or nerfed just like two shot was it also means any new content that is group focused will be useless and impossible to balance oh we want to make new hard content the bloodied build will make it trivial anyway
---
I don't even have the supply drop show up. I run all around the yellow circles sometime and get nothing. Sometimes my first use of the day works but doing a 2nd drop bugs out
---
If you want to get softlocked 5 hours into the main story line go ahead
---
What makes you think you won't be able to get the Ammo Converter after this season? Odds are its going to the atomic shop
---
They could put the converters at train stations in place of those ammo vending machines that 0 people use.
---
You win some, you lose some.  At least you did you man lol
---
Maybe if they fix the terrible prices on it
---
I thought the same thing, it would be cool if they were added to train stations or something so people who start playing years from now would have access to it.
---
Same with some of the other score  rewards like the chicken coop and the dark matter skin, I’m hoping score stuff will get added to the atomic shop eventually so other people will be able to get them in some way. Bethesda said they weren’t going to do that but it wouldn’t be the first time plans changed and they do something else they said they wouldn’t.
---
two things about this bugs me
---
1) the UI is annoying, if you have even 1 rounds less, you have to pick the lesser option 9 times
---
2) the rates are fucking horrendous, I'd accept a  decent loss, but holy shit I'd rather save up the 2K 38. ammo I have and spend caps to buy new than use this machine
---
I've used it to hide. I'd pose myself lying down, and then go AFK.
---
I'm just glad it's on a radio now and not whispering in my ear like my creepy uncle did when I was a kid and now have suppressed memories over.
---
it's only 3 ranks to get it
---
and it's a terribly worked out idea, it could have been good but they fucked it
---
And adjusting your field of view let’s you either zoom in very close, or get almost a 180° view, especially if you pull back a bit as well.
---
The post below yours has already same almost the same thing lol
---
I haven’t gotten time to sit down and watch yet. What do you mean they aren’t making the game “free to play?” Just that you have to buy a physics copy? I’d kinda hate it if they let players just get the game for free when some of us who pre-ordered are still staying with the game.
---
man, my game has always had this weird delayed reaction thing that makes me miss half the time and I can't even find out where to fix it, assuming that's possible
---
there's even a 1/10 chance I'll use/drink/equip the item I tapped E on
---
Opening up the Vaults as regular locations you can visit outside of the daily ops is a great idea
---
I've got my ammo converter, I've got my ghillie rifle, I've got my ghillie backpack, and I have my NW ghillie suit. Screw level 100 I've got everything I want.
---
Melee weapons don’t work well inside of vats, outside of vats though what you’re describing sounds like lag. When I play on my 700 ping house internet melee weapons just don’t connect for me, I’ll hit the target, it’ll make the noise and the damage numbers will pop up, but they won’t take any damage.
---
Is that not what the converter does?
---
Super Duper doesn’t proc on bulking scrap. But other than that, good suggestions!
---
If they’re increasing budget it’s possible that objects will no longer be attached to our stash limit too, as long as they’re instanced
---
What weapon do you use to kill the SBQ in what you claim to be upwards of 40 seconds?
---
No. They were asked if the game will be free in the future similar to Destiny 2. The developers said that they have no plans to make the free as the game is doing really well for them.
---
Did they say it was going to be in a bunker?
---
MTH maxes out at 31 caps with a Charisma of 20.
---
It’s just for tons of decorating. No one is complaining about decor issues. It’s architectural freedom everyone is complaining about. No one is going to build a house in a bunker. I have bad vibes about it. Plus there is only so much you can do inside a pre existing bunker.
---
Tyvm been looking for an answer.
---
That makes sense, thank you
---
“Fallout shelters” that’s actually what I assumed it was. Either that or it would be like a vault Tec ad for personal vaults is what I thought. Really cool idea though. Also I hope the new displays are free with some paid options
---
did you have a stroke?
---
Could have an "ammo box" also like the scrapbox
---
Very good my internet amigo!
---
mothman collectron, whole gist when the mothman shit comes back lmao
---
Probably in stages, I saw the rumor that the first set is gonna be rewarded on the 10th
---
Yes, occasionally. There is a pretty big damage bug in the game that effects VATS and non VATS. The sound of a hit is heard, but no damage. It's been that way for many months.
---
They’re still in the PTS for legendary perks, still plenty of time for it to change.
---
The more I think about it, legendary perks are supposed to be like the end of the game. I hope they do some reworking to make it more attainable, but I can understand that if they have an achievement for 7600 hours, that probably the amount of time they are expecting we play to finally have fully unlocked our character’s stats. The goal is for you too always want to lvl up your character and benefit from it, so it’d make sense that they’d be trying to make sure all their current player base has a reason t I keep lvling
---
I got it for free on Steam because I had it on the Bethesda launcher
---
I didn't start a new game, but if I wanted that achievement, I could
---
not like it takes that long to just leave the vault
---
Anyone can say anything. Let's see how much of this we actually see in the next 6-12 months.
---
Used it once and removed it.  Not worth the effort
---
People were using to slow and or crash servers but in order to do that you had to use infinite camp budget Wich is still in game.......Now for the real reason they did the whole who's got the perty camp and realized the can monitize the shit out of it.    Coming soon to an Atom shop near you interior walls now with more Tod
---
It really should be instant instead of by increments.. Do you know how long it takes to convert 4000 .38 ammo? Might as well just drop it.
---
I want my damn Beret lol
---
my ex girlfriend is named Paige
---
so seeing her in game as a fat, bald black man made me miss the good old days where I dissapointed her by choose anythong but her
---
I think you might have had a stroke
---
Haven’t seen that issue before, albeit I use medium speed weapons so landing a hit in general is just less likely for me unless I’m using vats
---
Line in the sand event.  Loot everything then head into fort defiance and scrap.  Without scraper perk I ended up with 700 plus steel
---
I've killed hundreds, never had one drop. Bought one for 18000 caps in a vendor. Now thanks to Bethesda's bullshit no trading Bullion rewards I now need two more so I can mod my Strangler Heart PA's on two characters.
---
Ideally Fuel would be crafted in batches of 100(without counting Ammosmith/Super Duper) and not in batches of 20 like if it was some kind of rifle weapon ammunition, I mean a basic Flamer eats 9.1 Fuel per second and has a magazine size of 100(which most people will upgrade to 200).
---
If the best way to get Fuel is to craft another type of ammunition and covert it you know something is wrong with Fuel crafting, I know it was increased from 5 to 20 in the past, but come on.
---
Basically what u/shiny-wooper said, they’re unique paint variants that can only be acquired through the aid drops. It’s like the heavy rocket mod for the All Rise unique Super Sledge, that mod can’t be learned or applied to any other Sledge
---
New to FO76 here. How can I do white exterior walls?
---
Yeah, but you could get creative with it. You could have a speakeasy, a storage room for your PA if we do get PA displays, or even a torture room below your totally normal seeming and welcoming home.
---
Took me a very annoyed 3ir4 min to realize it's just not there. I have not seen Beth mention or notice this. Without the helmet the suit just looks like generic superhero#7.
---
😂😂😂
---
IIRC, you don’t have to get all the pieces yourself. The game assumes you’ll be teaming up. So, while you may want to get one code for the fun of it, using a website like [NukaCrypt](https://nukacrypt.com) will let you know the full code for all three silos for the week.
---
stop fast travelling
---
make friends, travelling to them is free
---
vault 76 and your camp is free too
---
it'd be nice if you could get a horse
---
I know of people who grinded out the whole 100 in hours using exploits. They could grind the repeatable thousands of times per hour, 
---
giving any sort of repeatable reward should not be worth that.
---
Scrip/caps sure
---
bullion maybe
---
but infinite repeatable atoms is something they would absolutely never reward.
---
&gt; You can actually go inside is anytime and freely explore the Vault without doing the dungeon. They want to do the same thing with Vault 96 in the future. 
---
Great! Exploring Vaults is one of the best experiences in Fallout, in all Fallout games. Let's hope they open even 51 for exploration.
---
I don't know which is a more ridiculous target, 150 million concrete or 200 million cork! Probably the cork. 50 million cork would probably be a struggle, let alone 4 times as much!
---
Vending machine is fine. Player trading dialog is lame.
---
just do a search on here for ounce of prevention. other people have had problems. no idea if there was a fix though
---
I get more screws than concrete, what does that tell you lol
---
So is this replacing camps as they exist now, or is it just an additional option?
---
i would like a day of "kill the sbq" with X weapon xd
---
I drop them with crap ammo and chems infront of vault 76s door. That way the babies can get some stuff.
---
It’s going to have to be a pre existing structure to be instanced. Can’t put a big house on the already small camp area you have. A small bunker door going underground would make minimal room in your camp so you still had enough for the structure you created.
---
It will likely be like Far Cry New Dawn's expedition where you vertibot to a small set piece
---
Screw you, I **UPVOTED** all your posts. Deal with it, kid.
---
How do I do that on here? Anything nw related will get downvoted. A lot of us Xbox one still play nw religiously over adventure mode. My character lvl in adventure is 399 and is almost entirely leveled up from playing nw. Adv is just boring imo. I still have almost 3/4 of the map undiscovered. Sorry for the clickbait though. I was just hoping someone from Bethesda would see it
---
[No problem](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/ConcreteAnguishedCornsnake-small.gif).
---
your idea is fucking stupid because there's no fucking way they'll edit the animations, and there's no fucking way a wooden shield is gonna stop a bullet, and there's no fucking way someone is gonna lift a car door one handed
---
also no fucking way the BoS would use a riot shield
---
Gotcha. Definitely glad that won’t be the case, at least not without some serious advantages for the players who have stuck with the game this long. Think it’ll turn more of the current fan base away than bring in more new players. Especially since Destiny’s model has always been to sell costly expansions in bulk and make the value of the base game worthless.
---
That’s all decorative. None of it’s structural.
---
General idea but it's setup stupid like it should just be a dump
---
They promised they are reworking it. I guess we will see the #2, lol.
---
you sure act entitled
---
I bet you were fingering your ass while typing this out, think you were so superior
---
No, nope, naw.
---
Like like actually have presets like I want arrows 5mm 45 and 5.56 everything else with a press of a button just gets converted to single ammo digit tickets
---
Whichever one you like most.
---
Wouldn’t they just be able to have an instanced space that can track the layout of the structure you built in the open-world? So if I build an L-shaped enclosed house, the instanced interiors would be L-shaped and let me build from there.
---
well said
---
Ah I didn't know it was a single code for a week. Imma check it out, thanks again
---
This sounds awesome, but I'm already prevented from playing the game as I'd like thanks to the time gates. My stash box is always full of legendary items that are nothing but scrip fodder, or crafted SS which I can't even sell. Which is the problem that most of us face, as we reach the higher lvls. I just wish they'd address this, so I could get excited for upcoming content.
---
Atlas be praised
---
or instead you could manually dump all the ammo you don't need in there
---
your idea is way dumber to impliment, not like it takes super long to dump out those 4-5 ammo types
---
Yea i still haven’t gotten the achievement for leaving the vault and ive just started lol it still says i need to leave the vault when im 7 hours in
---
Sounds like a good update. Fingers crossed they don’t find a way to fuck it up
---
LITTLE things? Yeah, not being able to fast travel 100% of the time you try for over a year is little. Not being able to cripple the Queen for nearly four months is little.
---
I sided with the settlers. Gave them gold but not the raiders.
---
I would give the raiders some gold, too, if i could do it over. Only to boost my rep with them. Gold is much easier to grind out than rep.
---
Hellooooo nurse!
---
Guarantee we won't see the majority of this until 2021. I think we're going to be lucky to get BoS and one wasteland by the end of the year.
---
They added effects to the voice several months ago.
---
oh, they're doing a "One Wasteland" like how Elder Scrolls Online did a "One Tamriel"?
---
I reinstalled this game to soon then
---
story quest tells me "hey go to this area with lvl 16-21 enemies, but watch out for those lvl 62's!" while I'm only lvl 31
---
Yes.  I think it's just lag for me though since it isn't consistent.   My bloodied melee character one hits just about everything but it can take one or up to five hits to actually register.  It's annoying and really put me off from playing that build.
---
&gt;-just a mere 1000.
---
I mean to be fair, thats pretty much a lifetime supply.
---
You don’t have to wait long, just a couple of weeks.
---
Top Notch connection from Beantown Brewery ill have you know.
---
Sounds too good. After 2 years i'm skepical.
---
The concept of armor is already pretty dumb in a game like this. Shields are even dumber.
---
rifleman maybe. then you can rock a lever action rifle and look cool AF
---
You know what's infuriating? Not being able to sell all your ammo of a particular type. Either you get rid of most of it and drop the rest in a baggie, or you sit with the shame of having too little ammo left to trade sitting in your inventory.
---
Urgh, you miserable whingebag, it''s a 4-4 bug at best. Honestly I can (sort of) understand ragey, sweary posts taking serious issue with the VATS bug or fast travel. But a bit of clipping on a wall decoration, seriously, sort it out.
---
Unless they just load in to Whitespring station and stand around. Maybe walk to a nearby camp. Eat a sandwich,  call it a day. No bugs encountered
---
I sell them for 10 caps to new players in my vendors or if someone really want to hoard them high level.
---
Yea I saw that, what is that rubberbanding and why?
---
What weapon do you recommend for scorch beast? And is there a non faction grinding way towards the gauss shotgun?
---
I got stuck on Xbox prior to the last patch, and no, holding the exit button did not work as that's how I always exit the POS.
---
missing SS armor plans are more valid than the rank 100 reward being fucked up? and you decide that? lmfao foh
---
MOTHERSHIP ZETA BOIS
---
This and the post itself are both absolutely fantastic ideas. No more stacks of missiles and grenades sneaking their way into my inventory.
---
So the shape of your house in the world will dictate the shape of your instanced interiors then?
---
ah yes, a public service announcement to let people know you're a fucking idiot
---
good job
---
I always get them the second my subscription renews.
---
ya there are several ppl who have posted it on here. i found out the hard way lost a few things, nothing to cry about lol 
---
but i tried several times to switch characters and it was a different server each time. and then i had a friend come to my f01st server who they  them self dont have fo1st and then i tried to switch characters and i ended up on a new server and they stayed on the old one
---
Someone had mentioned there was a fix. You can do it with only one sample of blood, but the order you have to do it is different than the in-game prompt. You should be able to find the fix
---
Go to nuclear winter if you want PVP
---
Not holding my breath any of this will be good or released in a timely manner or released without a shit ton of bugs.
---
I named my Bloodied Power Fist the “Fist of Rage”.
---
Could be fun! So where should I focus my points at?
---
My point is that it is low impact and low severity when there is stuff out there that is more damaging to gameplay. I get you're disappointed but I still think this post is a bit strong.
---
Good advice here. I finished the quests and now the dialogue is mostly about "finding" someone in all this. Not great, but not having to hear her bitch about headaches is nice too.
---
My guess is all the items we earned this season will be atomic purchases are a later date, which honestly I’d prefer of the current system where half the items are too expensive.
---
Rewarding players with later atomic items for continued commitment to the game sounds like a better deal than BGS pumping out new lower quality cosmetics weekly
---
There are a lot of camps that can't be moved and just put backs because of silly restrictions like supported objects.
---
I already put the blood in the container they said lol ill try to figure it out it looks like alot of other people are having this issue aswell ill just wait until they decide it’s something they should hot patch
---
Nah we don't need anymore bugs with the stash trading items for random amounts of credits and hands them take weeks to fix it, the easiest way would be to have it work like a vendor so it doesn't mess with anything else
---
Agreed, and when it is played, it's primarily quad tesla spam, marsupial hopping while stealth boy'd and spamming nuka Quantums. Super ingenious features. Quality gameplay at its finest, idk how other shooters like battlefield or CoD keep up with titles like this
---
It's so simple, it will never work. Bethesda has an aversion to simple.
---
Not bad 6/10 would smash
---
Idk if you’ve tried it but you may get it back if you log out. Hope they fix it soon for you!
---
Let's see how much of this comes true, the ideas are good but the execution is really poor for some reason.
---
Here  [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic)
---
Fantastic, thanks! Looks like a mission to complete it yikes.
---
The workshop at abandoned bog town has 3 concrete nodes
---
I agree, PVP has no place in Adventure and should be removed completely allowing PVE players to enjoy the benefits of the workshops without being attacked by sweaty try hards.
---
I wouldn’t even care if they truncated decimals resulting in lost points or whatever. Just make the damn thing not frustrating to use.
---
Are you stupid? Do you have feces for a brain? My friends workshop wss taken by force in pvp, and I am unable to help him take it back unless the perp attacks me first.
---
I bet it will be similar to the vault (dlc) building in Fallout 4. I'm ok with that. Everyone gets their own area like that.
---
perception, agility, luck mainly. You want to be critting in vats constantly.
---
just have a google for some builds.
---
..there's a-lot more than 4-5 ammo types
---
sided with the settlers because my husband sided with the raiders and we wanted to see the difference. honestly couldn't care less about either side tbh.
---
I replied to the post next to you, on your post....whoopsie
---
And cap damage blows why in gods name is an auto pea shooter more effective then a mini nuke
---
Lol.Brings backmemories.
---
I am an aggressive melee tank. One game i had 19 kills and was smashing in skulls left and right with my sledge hammer, killed two 4 man teams solo near the end, when the last bloody bush wookie came sprinting out with a pole hook and got me.
---
I salute you fellow skull smasher.
---
Well some people used thos machines for a little while earlier this year.
---
Sounds great, they will probably take up 15 flamingos worth of budget
---
Or if you have the scavenger collectron, put his settings on junk and anything scrapped from that junk counts towards the weekly
---
Yes. Crazy long "logging in" just to get to lobby, then failure to find world, first time starting my own private server. Load freezes are also up, with a high frequency of bluescreens. Friends list shenanigans are to be expected, and some random amount of your team might have to be picked back up after each NW. Worst patch (ever) so far.
---
I second this request. Teammates and friends, please.
---
yes that is possible and probably overtuned, but that is with 6 food buffs and overdrive, fury and whiskey and a well setup melee character with vintage nukashine taken when she is about to land. It atleast takes abit of effort even though it should take alot more.
---
That indeed is the case. If I had gold you would have it sir
---
On perk loadouts:
---
&gt;That's a ways out, I gotta warn everybody.
---
On BoS content:
---
&gt;We are spreading this out over several batches as well, so, stuff will come as it's ready
---
Oof.
---
If Bethesda released a great game which had some very weird and quirky bugs but it was amazing and kept you on it for hours regardless of how long you played then I wouldn't mind. But they release a buggy game anyway with nothing to do when you reach higher levels bar grind the same 4 worthwhile events to get diddly. I could put tons of hours wrecking my workplace and failing at everything too it's not hard 😂. In fact Bethesda Devs make it look easy. It's amazing Bethesda don't even take on the top modders. Well we know why. It's because they probably don't want their content locked behind some overpriced pay wall and actually want the community to share and enjoy their hard work.
---
But it is never stated what kind of sandwich. These are questions that require answers!
---
i told people that vault 94 would come back in some complicity.
---
Yea I know. I got plenty of wiggle room. So I'm good for a bit.
---
I wonder what the new weapons will be. Here is hoping for the Heavy Incinerator, Laser RCW and .45 Pistol
---
Even with Fireproof maxed out you will be blowing yourself up with a gauss shotgun as a bloodied build.
---
Don't contribute unless you know it's pure donation. Reward boxes are utter garbage
---
There are a million games that are out there for people who enjoy online sword &amp; sorcery rpgs, but there is only one with firearms. I had my fill of hack &amp; slash/turn based games over a decade ago. I have always been a fan of fallout, and love that I can play with other people; instead, of companions who often stand there like idiots while you get riddled with bullets.
---
That’s what I’m assuming as well. Makes the most sense.
---
Hmmm. Can you sustain the ammo usage at your level? Start as rifleman and go commando once you are comfortable you can keep up with ammo usage?
---
Commando unless you want to roleplay as a sniper....which you can kind of still do anyways I suppose.
---
Fixer a bloodied fixer can kill the sbq in 30 secs you can even find dozens of videos on it it only thing faster is the magic weapons
---
There is most likely going to be a three week gap between the end of Season 1 and the start of Season 2.
---
Higher levels LOVE junk.
---
I see junk in a vendor i am THERE
---
gotta spend my caps on something
---
The impression I got is that it would be similar to the Overseer's house. So basically, you use the outside budget to make the outside of the building (with tinted windows). Then you enter the house and that will be it's own instance with it's own budget. So, that will allow you to build much larger houses on the outside since you don't have to use your outside budget on interior house stuff.
---
The main problems that I see are the following:
---
* How do you get power from outside to inside and vice versa? Will you have to build generators both outside the house and inside?
---
* Will there only be one door to the interior? What if you wanted to have a second entrance to your building?
---
in game text chat would be great
---
Isn’t that basically what it is now? Throw on pacifist mode and just ignore workshops?
---
yeah well tbh i've seen plenty of ult gat lasers at queen fights and they struggle to do any dmg. When a gat laser is hitting for 5 dmg per shot and a b2525 fixer is hitting for 600+ per shot its not even a comparison.
---
Junkie then, gives you the most dmg for your ammo.
---
Yes! But instead, it should be Todd Howard running around and telling people 'It just works!'
---
Go shoot super mutants at west tech and see which one has faster time to kill.
---
You will absolutely get your money worth even if you play just the campaign for 20 dollars.
---
Someone needs to keep these servers powered and running. 😝
---
The devs use them.
---
How about we can buy lunchboxes with our excess SCORE?
---
I'm powerin' your mom if you know what i mean ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
That’s because level 50 is the max for weapons and armor.... there is no level gear above that.
---
Damn I have 30k Steel Scrap. I might be a hoarder and pick up a lot of junk but almost everything can give you steel. Also as others mentioned, grabbing a bunch of guns and scrap them with the Scrapper Perk equipped (Uranium Fever is indeed a easy way to farm steel). If you have a bunch of Ores you can equip the Super Duper Perk and craft away as well. What platform do you play on?
---
We need a new word for the try hards. I mean they are trying hard but for zero reward, which seems counter to the term. It isn't briefing or exploiting, because it's just a failed game dynamic. We need to launch a committee 😂
---
Buying .308 for 1 cap per at Player vendors everytime I see it... Ive got 100k of .308 :D also crafting UC .308 helps alot
---
 love the voice
---
I want more budget like everybody else, but I'm not going to complain about an extra roomful of budget. I've already finalized the structural design in my main builds, and have nowhere else to put extra decorations if I did have the budget.
---
This feature will be a welcome one to me.
---
K, thanks
---
I call my mr handy buzzblade that I use to kill low level players “Codsworth’s Penis”
---
I've never once not done enough damage to get loot with an ultracite gatling laser. I don't fully spec for heavy weapons and hit for 8-12 damage per shot and almost never need to stop to reload. I can only imagine what someone with all of the heavy weapon perks at rank 3 would be doing.
---
Also you're comparing something no one can easily get to something that's stupidly easy to acquire. It's not a good comparison. The whole point is that the laser is a good way to conserve ammo anyway, it's not about what does the most damage.
---
They are maybe just mining bitcoins.
---
We're you in a team? Or you could jump in front of the bullets maybe
---
This is great advice.
---
I just tried to get it to work at nothing happened
---
Going to donate 250k concrete
---
Good call on collection, many thanks! Idk if I want to take, build up, and defend a workshop but appreciate that tip too as last resort 😀
---
They may have had a hard time understanding you if you were in area chat and spoke how you type. Work shops are PvP zones. If you can't stand the heat, stay out of the kitchen.
---
Ive got a bloodied handmade with faster fire right, applied the Chinese paint to it and called it 
---
"AK but wong"
---
Huehuehue
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
If your on Xbox ill buy 4k off you right now 😂
---
Do you even prime bro? Ammo converter is useless for endgame!
---
PUT IT BACK ON! THINK OF THE CHILDREEENNNNN 😂
---
 Where could I watch the whole thing?
---
Anybody know of a good cheep ammo to make to convert into ammo points for 556? I had the idea of using railway spikes since they didn’t use lead and only steel, but the math I did said it wasn’t going to work... 
---
(I think it was something like 700 steel to make 300 railway spikes to convert into 1000 points, 1000 points only gives 100 556 where as just using that 700 steel to make bullets nets over 2000+ 556. I think... Math isn’t my strong suit but I imagine the calculator didn’t lie.)
---
its not a cult. i would tell you the story about the place but i dont want to mess with the tags for it and all that
---
I have a lot od fun contesting workshops and taking the  junk from others. The steel is handsome nowadays. Simly put it is yet another game machanics. If you dont understand it, cant defend yourself just keeeeeep awaaaaay from workshops...and kindly drop all your caps
---
I am coming after your workshops
---
I’m with you on this point. I rush through my dailies in adventure to make sure a round of NW doesn’t auto complete them and then straight to NW. Trying to get good. Definitely improving...felt I graduated to a new skill level today.  But still feel like a half NW noob.
---
I'm a bloodied fixer commando build and I'm doing over 400 dmg per shot pretty easily
---
I bought the game a few days ago and so far I've enjoyed it far more than I thought I would.
---
Only encountered a handful of glitches (and only 1 that affected prpgression) and the lag is pretty minor.
---
The player base is also surprisingly friendly. Haven't been attacked yet and the first high level guy I met gave me a bag of basic supplies!
---
As for it being a multiplayer game, I'm level 24 and I've been playing solo since the start (got no friends yay) and other than some events I've barely encountered other players and outside of end-game content it seems completely optional.
---
Also the radio is far better than fo4. Julie &gt; Travis.
---
Sry im pc :/
---
It’s a cult. 
---
Listen to the lore.
---
Hell, the dialogue in the event basically says “cult.”
---
Biggest issue is ammunition consumption. I switched over and the pain is real. That said, you learn to double and single tap to conserve ammo.
---
Another point - you can swap cards and receivers as needed to swap between builds. Commando or sniper stealth modes are very easy switches.
---
here is their full comments:

---
But it sounds additional
---
in the original post, there is a link
---
It's ok my luck is only 2 so I expected as much :)
---
I wish I could give you an award.
---
It is just a game kid
---
Still a lot better than the terrible accent on the prison warden.
---
Sigh.
---
&lt;unzips&gt;
---
I'll gladly have a look at your YouTube channel mr 9 posts.
---
Yes...
---
Fast travel to the watoga train station and the corpse should follow you. Works 99% of Times ^^
---
Im pretty sure bethesdas servers are run by hamsters spinning wheels
---
Don't worry about. It will auto complete by itself. With or without players donating stuff.
---
Wait... There's something useless or poorly designed in Fallout 76? Tell me more...
---
Definitely worth it. And the effects depend on your build. Usually vanguards or unyielding
---
😂
---
The top floor at abandoned bog town has 5-7 bags of concrete and the secret room has another 5-6 bags of fertilizer.
---
Actually people are intentionally turning it off so the event takes longer and you get more mobs and thus more loot. I found that out after googling it cuz I was being screamed at by a preteen for turning it on. Given the current score system, I just do the easy crap events to get it done and over with for my daily score points.
---
Lol! 🤣🤣🤣
---
Work around doesn't work anymore, but way to be a condescending prick.
---
It's an exploit.
---
Is that how a player I saw had a neon pink baseball bat?
---
Gotcha
---
There was an exploit where you could build double sided walls but they patched it out causing an uproar in the building community, they plan to re add the exploit tho lmao
---
Completely fucked up the ounce of prevention quest, posted work around sure as fuck isn't working.
---
I Second this^
---
Oh damn, we've got to get Bethesda to the burn ward for that one.
---
Nope not wasting my time.
---
Just speaking from my experience. I went as a rifleman for the longest time since I wanted the highest damage-per-shot.  But I then realized an automatic receiver on my Instigating Fixer could still 1-shot 95% of the enemies, provide lower VATS cost (I’m a VATS player), and provide incredible damage-per-second. So I haven’t looked back on switching to commando (although it made me retire a complementary Instigating Lever that I also used).
---
There is no free will, only my will.
---
For all the people saying this isn't possible due to limitations, that isn't true. People don't realize software is like clay, it can molded to exactly what you need. The issue is it takes time, and unfortunately Bethesda's approach to F76 has been "just enough".
---
Yeah, I figured the line about relinquishing your material goods gave it away.
---
When they say next month, I'm pretty skeptical
---
#Bloodied Red Ryder BB Gun!  
---
and a smaller version called "Short Pew Pew" to make fun of every idiot who bought the 'Plan: Short Pew' thinking it was for a gun.. 🤦‍♂️
---
Nah but *seriously*, i want basic makeshift shields/bucklers. Riot shields, hubcaps, nuka-machine panels, hammered eyebot chassis, miniature vault-tec vault doors, car doors, Red Rocket panels, Slocum Joe's donut shield..  
---
It is the epitome of the wasteland image: hide head from greenskin's bullets behind this juryrigged piece of scrap metal! Do that, and make block *holdable* rather than some annoying animation cycle that nobody even bothers to use.. if we can build fusion generators, we can hammer metal flat to hide our face from bullets and flamethrowers!
---
I got secondhand embarrassment watching so I turned off the stream.
---
Yeah. I don't know the specifics but I believe it has something to do with blueprints.
---
I used to run a water company so I had to have two of them powering too many water purifiers.
---
IIRC the scope gives you a higher accuracy Rating which should Affect vats Hit Chance positively. But dont quote me on that
---
Crimson

*cRy MoRe*
---
It's unbelievable this hasn't even been addressed yet, nevermind fixed..
---
Not to mention they used the technology to make their own weapons of mass destruction. Such hypocrites lol.
---
Im sorry that my English is Bad, not everybody can be born as an fat Amarican. You should know that English is in the most Countrys not the the first language. But how you sayed, when you cant stand the heat, stay out of the kitchen.
---
Excellent. Thank you
---
Is it tho?
---
I name all my favourite guns after items on a menu. For instance, my plasma caster is the #7 Truffle Fries, my .50 Cal is the #12 Clam Chowder, etc. Keeps things interesting.
---
It’s like the hired inexperienced modders to make content for this game
---
Yeah.. I remember. We HAD to have extra repaired mainframe cores on us all the time back then because the silos were so laggy, it could take FOREVER to 1) get the mainframe cores OFF the mainframe and then 2) put them back on once repaired. 
---
So we'd carry around enough for up to 3 launches at a time. I will say that now the silos are NOT THAT buggy / laggy as they used to be thankfully. But I do miss having the cores already in my inventory when running silos all day
---
Ps4 right?
---
 I once had a huuuuuge waterfarm and had 4 Fusion Generators 😂
---
Many thanks!!

Maybe, I know the roadmap says that it’ll start mid-September, but didn’t give an exact date
---
THANKS!  I have a LOT of concrete to donate lol
---
I dunno the servers are pretty darn stable, it's everything else that's hanging on by threads.
---
Lol k friend. Cuz that ammo factory really needs the converter?
---
Lol, do u need me to do it for u?
---
Not just private servers FO76
---
Yikes comrade. That's how workshops...work. if you don't want to PVP, don't take one unless you're in a private server or you're ready to face the consequences or flee them. I don't understand the aggression?...
---
yep! afaik the pink/indigo/yellow ones only exist as non-legendaries, and there's no way to apply any of those three colors to existing baseball bats. so they're not only "cool" but sought after my some. (some is me, I only have the pink variant haha)
---
I don't agree with this at all. Mainly, that dilapidated wrecks are stupid in a post-apocalyptic setting. 
---
Luckily, you have the brick building and metal building sets. If you're willing to spend atoms, the contemporary building set would be the magical castle you were referring to.
---
I think they should bring back the Bozar.
---
Literally going through this right now , I'll tell you if I find a fix.
---
Resource collector, eight Industrial Water Purifiers, four Vending Machines.  One fusion generator won’t cover that.
---
Yes it would. Something simple like click both sticks together or double click sticks to open world chat would be perfect.
---
Normally I’d agree with you but I just got a bloodied +25 fire rate handmade from her. I don’t play bloodied though so it’s actually not all that great anyway. I just know people like them.
---
Definitely worth it. And the Buttressed mods for the pieces provide the highest non-PA damage resistance available (someone correct me if I’m wrong on this).  Preferred Legendary effects will depend on your style of gameplay, but Unyielding tends to be a good universal one.
---
With targets at 95% VATS I consistently even at close range miss the first few shots with either my auto handmade or auto  combat rifle, full commando build. I seem to be firing over their heads in the case of super mutants and ghouls but not too sure.
---
I do find like many have suggested here to wait a second or two before firing while in VATS sometimes that works. That makes me think this is a network sync problem, lag.
---
Without question they're going to borrow the existing GNR Plaza Fallout 4 CC as one of these locations. That the kind of lazy that's right up Bethesda's alley.
---
I keep wondering how the hell are they going to handle modding in a game like this, it seems like there would be a lot of compatibility issues unless modding is only allowed on FO1st private worlds and everyone must have the same mods installed.
---
I hope that by "new weapons and armor" they actually mean new and not just skins and reskins, I know the Auto Axe was datamined and if I recall correctly so was the Service Rifle and the old Assault Rifle, I hope those 2 are new weapons and not just skins, I'd like the Service Rifle for my Free States character.
---
I'm also interested to know how many players there are across all platforms, just out of curiosity I want to know if there's more than 100k.
---
Guess if I were a fat "Amarican" as you call it, that would hurt. 🤷‍♂️
---
Do you need to go back to school for reading comprehension?
---
Fat American. That's gonna be my new go to insult lol
---
You could trade that for something very good gz and I hate you
---
You are playing an American game don’t complain when people mostly speak English. As for the one shot thing. Get good or go home.
---
I would like to see the removal of perk packs as rewards unless they prove beneficial to leveling legendary perks when live.
---
Maybe more atoms? :B
---
Douchebags don’t care. I’ve been one shot from across the zone by shotgunner by folks clearly enjoying being jerks. You can’t win with them. Just bite the bullet and move on....
---
Or remember their handle and next time you seem them doing that shit to someone else, you pop them. Revenge is a dish best served from out of the blue.
---
[Fallout 76 ping tool, I use this so as to get depressed at my horrendous and un fixable high ping in this game.](https://pingserverstatus.com/fallout76.php)
---
Still waiting on the bulldozer feature since b.e.t.a...
---
It be cool if it offered more stims and ammo crafting  mats. Maybe even a legendary weapon. Iv used them at the start of the game but since vendors stims are waaaay to easy to get.
---
I don’t see a ‘mid-September’ date. I see ‘Fall’ on the first roadmap and then I see ‘September’ in the updated one.
---
&gt;Also a fascinating anecdote about how, prior to Wastelanders, they had considered the idea of the Overseer being a developer-controlled character in random worlds
---
Yeah but that'd mean that the devs would actually have to play their own game
---
I'm in the UK and my ping is consistently higher to EU West servers. 🤷‍♂️
---
I dont complain about it that I must speak English, I complain that People think they are better because my English is bad.
---
But why? 😂
---
Reading comprehension?
---
Ward, the guy it took multiple patches to fix? Probably gonna take seven or so just get him over here.
---
i agree its a good way to conserve ammo, but its the people putting out big dmg that make the event not take 20 minutes and actually complete it. 10 people with gat lasers might conserve ammo but if she decides not too land frequently the even will fail.
---
Legitimately no one said that to you here, and your story doesn’t have any mention of the person mocking you
---
Someone once brought up the point that we may see ammo converter skins in future seasons
---
noneya
---
Honestly now I'm even more disappointed to learn that, would have thought in the year that I stopped playing they would have fixed that. Like theres level 90+ enemies, 200+ players but level 50 weapons? Wack.
---
I always think the event silently closes, nothing happens with no reward, I never bother with most small events anymore, I just do the larger ones with treasury notes.
---
I just made one and my first one was a 2 shot.  Not sure how amazing that is but with an aligned sniper barrel so far at medium range even with the 2 shot bit it takes a second further shot to kill a 63+ mob and that's sort of disappointing to me tbh.
---
Slow fire rate weapons are typically undesirable due to lower dps, unless you can one shot the enemy with it, you’re better off using a fast fire rate heavy gun
---
Todd Howard's hopes and dreams.
---
I know, that’s the only reason I’m hanging onto it. I already have a 2shot and an instigating one that I keep around. It would basically be a slightly faster firing regular one for me. Although I haven’t tried to figure out if the fire rate buff is equivalent to the two shot in damage output. So that might change my plans a bit
---
Will there be doughnuts? If yes then I'm in.
---
My acc - yes, I'm able to use any (steam or beth), since it was "moved" from beth to steam few months ago  
---
My wife's game copy was bought via steam and she is not able to login via bethesda launcher
---
What?, how, my (non legendary) non automatic one only does 62 damage
---
Looks sweet
---
Looks like you really are a fucking idiot. I said a guy took over a friend's workshop, and I was unable to help him because of the new pvp rules.
---
This isn’t working for me :(
---
It didn't use to work this way before patch 20. They nerfed team PvP so now we're stuck with this dumb shit.
---
Yeah, I found a level 5 Indigo baseball bat on one of my old characters. I think I ended up selling it for 15,000 caps.
---
The ammo machine can die in the stanky pits of shitdom....
---
How do they use them if they don’t play the game?
---
NO
---
I've never seen it fail but whatever you say.
---
Thats really cool my way just involved stacking power armors all the way up. Took alot longer than ur method for sure
---
Waiting for a wolf pet ;)
---
I don't give a shit if someone wants to take over a workshop. I'm saying I can't help a friend defend his workshop because of the new pvp rules.
---
Another fellow raider, I see. 😈👍🤘
---
Aw if you were on PS I'd be happy to help you out. 
---
I definitely don't completely understand the way the weight works in and out of PA. You possibly have regular armor that offers weight reductions like I do then when we get in PA we lose those perks
---
I don't want to see legendary run rewards that can be obtained easily through normal gameplay like caps, scrips, bullion, perk cards and building mats, replace those with cosmetic items and atoms. We could use some new hairstyles, tattoos and paint, they could add some of those as season rewards.
---
What is about xboxxerx  first comment? He insulted me for my writting abbilitys. They are bad, but that was clearly an Insult
---
Doing events like uranium fever  and collect all the weapons and sell them at the train station Outside. 
---
Do West tek runs and collect all the weapons and drag yourself to the nearest vendor and sell them.
---
Build a waterfarm, you can sell purified water at 5 Caps per max.
---
Personally i usually craft 1 mutation serum, sell it for 500 Caps, sell Rad-x, radaway, stimpaks, chems and other stuff along with water for easy 1200-1300 Caps per Day and then I Run a ammo Player vending machine and get more Caps that way. I Mostly sell .50, 5mm, 5.56, Fusion cores, and the odd legendary weapon here and there.
---
He was very very thirsty...
---
Mrs. 9 posts. And I didn't realize I was meant to be impressing you. God, now I'm going to have to tear down all my builds if you don't think they're worthy... 🙄
---
Dear god... sometimes, whenever she talks about “anything goes” being played on repeat if she never fixed up the station, I just think about how much better it would’ve been if that actually happened
---
So you're not gonna link me to your YouTube channel?
---
It's almost like he has no honor.
---
1 purified water = 5 Caps... easy 1400 caps daily with next to no effort^^
---
I have 2 in my camps, mostly because I utilize maximum build area and don't want to run power wires all over the place, I like to keep it relatively tidy.
---
Are you sure there weren't any ammo factories at your camp?
---
You take over the ammo factory then power the ammo plant when facing the ammo machine blueprint the wire coming off the red part of the machine the correct wire will be floating if you place it in a camp then its non moveable unless you pay to move your whole camp
---
Leveling improvements of spawns would be great.
---
I'm alone, level 26 and I have to go into the one tower and grab and an Id card, and the securitrons and the robo lady is a level 50!
---
Like, insta death!
---
I just dont like the weapon that much. The dmg is fine imo, but I just feel so much better being a beastly heavy gunner with any kind of heavy guns with faster fire rate
---
Wrong sub. You want the marketplace.
---
I have this issue on PC but all I run is Marsupial, Speed Demon, and Herd Mentality. I had this issue even when I only ran Marsupial.
---
Good lord that title. 
---
But yea, the SS armor is definitely "werth" it.
---
Bethesdas servers
---
I had one when I was running around with heavy weapons. What I found was it was very accurate when using VATS, and really inaccurate when firing normally.
---
So if you were in VATS you could easily hit everything, out of VATS it could easily miss a stationary target.
---
Unfortunately, I really hate using VATS, and much prefer to free aim everything.
---
They are excellent with high AP and gun fu
---
He'd need flood insurance.
---
I just read that healing factor is causing the respawn bug. Maybe take it off for now and see if that helps!?
---
Nunya?
---
This is a good daily thing because for new players it gives them a challenge and for experienced players it’s a good source of xp,you just need to get gud
---
The second one I made was B2525 
---
I don’t care for bloodied build lol ironic
---
I literally can't understand if these patches are tested how something like this gets through to the live build of the game
---
It's current interface is a number two
---
Next month on your 76 pip boy.
---
Right?  Why aren’t they vague and open to interpretation?
---
I have one on my Junkie and my bloodied build.. they 1 shot everything and with the right AP buffs 4 -6 consecutive vats kills is possibly
---
Does it matter what platform you are using?  I'm on XBox and message non-friends all the time.  Mostly to see if they need help or what mission they are working on.
---
You can go to their name on social tab, click on name and it shows option to message.  Or find them on the map, highlight, and select message.
---
...at which point it becomes permanent ghost budget...
---
I do care about this but then I saw 😬
---
I wonder if you'll be able to get the same rewards. Like the flag emote. My biggest regret not pushing for it. Wasn't impossible to achieve.
---
There's so a shed by the nuka cola plant on the map look for the mothman church and west of that is a concrete motherload with fertilizer scattered in the same shed
---
I agree with ya, I wish it was earlier to give all ammo
---
Urgh. Work then
---
Please remain civil.  Thank you.
---
Couldn't get passed title requirement haha
---
They also need to fix the Fast Travel bug that sends you to a completely different place than the one you chose.
---
I yell PERISCOPE UP every time. Turning DOF off is like cleaning the glass.
---
When you get to the Raiders and Settlers quest lines just do both until it ask who you want to side with, that way you can get all the items and rep before closing off the quest lines 
---
Try not to use too many weight reduction perk cards and sell or scrap extra armor and weapons for mod plans to gain extra weight back, the one weight reduction I would recommend though is traveling pharmacy in strength 
---
And use this site for help with creating a build 
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks
---
But besides all that have a ton of fun💪🏽
---
10:1 conversion into base components of broke down ammo would be acceptable.
---
I think they tried to make it feel more immersive, because your character does lean in with it's computer, the sounds are the typing and computer noises. They just made every screen behave like a web pages. If you hit back, you are just hitting the back button to go to the previous screen, or page, you were on, so it goes back through every single screen you went through to get there. Their "X" close button to get you out entirely, however, is listed only on one page, the front menu page. You have to select to go back to that page, and then you can select to leave....which is....less immersive, more painstaking in dealing with...
---
They didn't do a good job of building a simple sandboxed computer.
---
Same with weapons display boards? Not sure if that’s a patch 21 thing or it was earlier.
---
-Workshops are PvP zones. Don't go into them if you're not prepared for it/don't want PvP.
---
-There is a google doc floating around here somewhere called Where to Farm All The Things. If you can find that somewhere in this cursed reddit hellscape, then you'll be set in terms of knowing where to go from what.
---
-Team up. Especially on public building teams. Those particular teams boost your intelligence and you'll gain more XP
---
-Levelling sucks until after about level 30. I also wouldn't recommend going to the purveyor to spend your legendary scrip until after you hit level 50 so that you'll get level appropriate gear you can use for awhile.
---
Run thru pleasant valley ski resort loot all the frag grenades sell em easy pz
---
It updates once a day, now it has moved to concrete but last time I checked, it showed over 200m in steel donations.
---
 [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events)
---
A bloodied weapon with the right perks can be pretty crazy. For every 5% of damage you take, your weapon gains 5% damage output. Most people keep there health around 20% and their weapons now do 80% more damage.
---
There are no need for higher level weapons.  When you consider all the perks and legendary effects available. Most enemies top out at 68. I don’t know where you are seeing level 90 enemies. Nothing needs fixing there.
---
This has been an issue for well over a month
---
You can contest the workshop after. Crunch those simple numbers kid. Instead of bitching try, learn, adapt
---
after playing NV for the first time I tried to go back to fallout 4 and I literally couldnt just because of the fact that the story was shit and the dialogue was cheesy. I still play 76 a lot though because it’s honestly better than 4
---
Sounds like a bunch of empty promises to keep people from cancelling subscriptions. The mod support that was promised two years ago - and they still don't know how it's even supposed to work yet they keep promising it. Or the "expeditions" that are intended spur the imagination of players but seem so vague and undeveloped as if they came up with the idea the night before.
---
Yao Guai McRib
---
In terms of the amount of time necessary to have a probable chance at getting anything good, one might think that it wouldn't be "worth it". But a large point of the game is to get good gear, train, then get better gear. The game has a constant evolution to it. SS gear is that next stage in the evolutionary process. When you look at it this way, it is worth it, because it quite frankly is the name of the game.
---
Lol you idiots knew you were exploiting and youre all crying because the glitch isn't there anymore, you're all scrubs and should just quite the game and go cry somewhere else
---
Pro tip: drop nukes and missiles. No one will buy them since explosives are useless in FO76
---
Oh great! Thanks. I kept looking in-game and was boggled. Much appreciated!
---
I can definitely see an expidition leading us to The Pitt
---
Indeed, they had mentioned Dallas in the context of one of these features, which probably is what used to be Escalation Studios, who did the SnapMap component for id in Doom 2016 and were acquired by Bethesda thereafter.
---
True but if your budget is that hard up that such a tiny plan is hurting you then you're 1) over building or 2) need to rethink your life choices just sayin lmao
---
I think the Scorch Beast Queen is level 90. Usualy yea theres other players but they are usualy 200+ and somehow we all get wrecked while they throw level 50 &amp; 60 legendary creatures at us at the same time. Its just kinda loosing a feel of actually being able to play and have fun. I hate this constant grind for this that gives you not much in return. And if the levels are capped for equipment and some enemies but not players whats the point of advancing. Or even playing. Theres no real rewards even to this day. The games kinda fallen apart to me.
---
Was this on PC today? A group of us had just finished killing the queen and a rad storm rolled in. It looked pretty cool
---
Vats has generally worked for me but good to know. Won’t be using that for a while
---
Probably delayed the rewards till the next patch
---
Can we just be able to put things on shelves and wallpaper on both sides of the wall.
---
Either that or we wait for Project Alpha to complete.
---
It sucks too since my character is built around VATS and crits. Oh well
---
Yet workshops are PVP zones.  Needs more tweaking really
---
I’ve only ever gotten 1 or 2 good drops from the queen
---
I agree with you. My first decent was 1*bloodied, since im bloodied i used it with VATS for while. My second decent was B/10dwa/fmswa, so i didnt use VATS. Then i become frustrated and went to a different weapon
---
Flamethrower trap. Requires the Fireproof perk card.
---
So define mod it till its broken. I've got some... broken.
---
Probably on Tuesday when the Atomic Shop refreshes.
---
They... already did. The first patch was borked, and the new version came out on Tuesday. It's still bad. And afaik they haven't said anything about updating it further.
---
I have a B33%, my absolute favorite weapon. Unfortunately I'm trying to not be a bloodied build any more. So gonna have to roll a instigating one soon, hopefully with the 33% because that's pretty integral to me.
---
The 11th
---
Ok. Thanks.
---
I cry when you leave this world, Ok? So we both Happy.
---
So what? Reusing assets is a good idea. It’s a great way to add more to the game without spending a butt load of time making everything perfect.
---
That's not new either, but go off I guess.
---
Yes I've had so much lag lately.  Finishing events or quests and it taking forever to load the reward screen. 
---
Frame drops, crashes, enemies spawning and hitting me before they render.  Not very happy considering I pay for it monthly.
---
Awesome capture!
---
Being able to take pictures in this game is one of favorite aspects.
---
I can't wait to get this actually. I nicked a nade from someone's unlocked machine (sshhhh) &amp; tested it on my crops &amp; I love it! I like to make a lot of adhesive &amp; my CAMP has a pretty large food crop so this would be great. My only problem now is building up reputation. I'm not even friendly yet :(
---
Same thing happens to me.
---
I think there are many different bugs that contribute to this result, but one common thread is that VATS has a hard time keeping up with certain enemies.  Scorchbeasts and Ghouls can cover a large distance in a short amount of time.
---
Ok but fix the bug that lets people break camp size limitations and leave the walls alone. You don't think it's stupid we can't have interior walls?
---
Yep. Having fun. What did his teammmate do?
---
maybe like collect something that can be made into a soup or whatever but not those things right there 0/20
---
I’ve actually been buying them at 1c just for conversion.
---
They mentioned vault 94 and 96, what about the other vaults? Will they be associated with some quest down the line? Will we see the dwellers?
---
No, they said it's a door in your preexisting camp that contains an instanced area  you can build in without stressing the main server.
---
I have, and have found that in VATS it won't do that. Super annoying though.
---
Guess I’m glad I got it when I had the chance
---
try storing item and placing again
---
As soon as they authorize mods theres going to be like 60 variations of the exact same patches the devs needed to do the first time.
---
Part of it is, none of the atom shop or seasons stuff is put on the PTS. They cite "technical reasons" for why they can't, but that's gotta be bullshit. ESO does it just fine on their PTS. I understand it's not 1:1, but the whole thing reeks.
---
I don’t even think I have gotten one and I have killed so many
---
BULK ITEMS AND SCRAP THEM AND BOOM
---
Were there any questions along the lines of: "how much time do you spend playing the game?" or "what is your testing process for content like Gillie suits?"
---
How do you get these numbers? I rolled an excellent bloodied fixer and am built for stealth rifle dmg but it isn’t nearly as high.
---
Oh so, you're a content creator who is unwilling to share their content?
---
Still waiting for a link. I like camp videos. I want to see these tricks in creative effect.
---
The more I see, the more I'm willing to also express outrage at their removal
---
Ok cool. Bunker seemed like a pretty useless item for any builders in the game.
---
Protip for events only the 1's with an ! In the symbol award treasury notes that you can trade for bullion
---
I had no idea about the Sten Gun in the files but that sounds like an awesome weapon to be added.
---
The sooner you give him back his missing equipment the better
---
I recognize this room 👍
---
100%
---
Might grab some fusion
---
I’m pretty sure people who gank low levels don’t care what you emoting my guy.
---
You advance to unlock more perks and change up your build. You complain about grind but are asking for more grind for higher level weapons lol
---
Duped chrismas presents, u gotta watch out for it while people are at ur camp the will max you caps and keep buying, making you miss out on those caps
---
Probably Patch 22 now? They seem to push most fixes to the next patch.
---
No, I don't think it's fair.
---
Maybe we were on different forums then...mostly Fallout 4, a few years ago.  It was widely ‘joked’ about.  Sarcasm...not ignorance.
---
Can you elaborate, I’m not sure what you mean by max out your caps
---
I just hope "New weapons and armor" doesn't mean "Better weapons and armor."
---
Because that will be a sure-fire sign of power creep and mean that grinding is pointless since the next "expansion" will have better stuff.
---
It should be stuff on par with the best stuff now. Like Brotherhood armor that has the same stats as Secret Service armor, and weapons that perform as well as the best gear (And honestly, the top weapons in Wastelanders were very Energy Weapon-focused, it would be good to see some new Ballistic stuff).
---
What the fuck are you even talking about?
---
Still learning how to build amazing structures like this one- how do you get the pillars in the corner of the floor/ceiling like that? 
---
Mine always refuse to be placed so I have an awkward “feature wall”
---
HA! I've turned up at a defend with my main which is about to hit 300 because i was in the neighbourhood or bored and there's been some lower level there and i can feel them watching me wondering when i'm about to strike. And then after we win i give them some stuff and depart.
---
Only available on PC via mod download. 
---
Just like perk loadouts, better inventory, better strings, better hp bar, glowing items like meatpiles, loot bags, etc. 
---
The game is 100x better in terms of qol on pc thanks to mods
---
Nice gonna have to look into the asbestos lining then. Still stuck on a piece of SS trying to roll unyielding, but my DR is considerably solid at 436 prolly cuz of mutations
---
I don't mind the bullion so much, but needs a bit more, like maybe one days worth (200) for per prize, at least. I would trade the bullion and the rest for more atoms and more camp items too. How about breaking up some of the well themed bundles in the Atom shop and spreading them as rewards. I mean I like the chicken coup, but did I have to brave the forbidden galaxy to get it? Ghillie stuff and a spaceship style playground toy? The fireplace hidden door is super cool, but it all seems very grab bag.
---
It's funny in a way.
---
The quality of Fallout 76 is what you'd expect if Fallout 76 was built by the inhabitants in Fallout 76.
---
You can't get away from the personality of a Fallout game, though.
---
For all intent and purposes, you shouldn't want to play this game because of how many things don't function properly, but you do.
---
Ever since I got it like two weeks? ago, I've been playing it from sun-up to sundown.
---
There's just something about the atmosphere or character of the game.
---
I suppose thats true. It just seems like there's a lot of limiting mechanics that I guess are there to offer challenge to the player and give long term playability. But at the same time it feels just repetative.
---
There is a max limit of 30k caps you can have on you at a time, so I was doing a event and some1 bought one of my weapons and I hit 20k from it they then proceeded to stay at my camp for another 10mins ish maybe less and bought 1 of my high value items that was priced at 30k so I missed out on the 20k caps from it, also I would advise learning the plans and just dropping the ones you have extra of, they were highly duped and u see them in every vendor
---
Why not both ? As a melee build i have no use in scrapping ammo, with this at least i get to exchange useless ammo i'd never use into 45 and 5.56 to resell to people.
---
On my melee build I use xo-1 mainly for the extra resistance, but I also mod the pieces for all +1 strength. So as long as it’s modded for strength, I don’t know if it matters
---
If you're scared of pvp or dont like it hide behind passive mode on private servers and dont take workshops on public ones that simple. Or be a weakling and get pvped and then whine on reddit your call
---
I’ve seen it on PS4 couple of times. The problem is people standing on the edge so sbq missing the platform to land
---
I see, tank you tank you
---
If you see more than one fusion generator listen for the sound of multiple machinery hidden underground or in structures; there is a high probability they are using the ammo factory exploit. You need a large amount of power to run several of those and all the exploiters doing it I've seen have needed more than one generator; make sure to report them immediately if so.
---
Just so you know, the faschnat recipes are included in that challenge. I personally think that's a dick move.
---
 For those moaning that people who bought it before would be pissed, I can guarantee that 99% of people who own that coat no longer wear it. It was a decent deal for atoms the came with a cosmetic, you can’t be pissed that it gets added for free in an update almost a year later, or even to the atom store (For a decent price and not locked in a bundle!!)
---
As for the questions, I have an external 2TB SSD and the is good quality.  I'm not incompetent.  I know what should work and the private worlds don't.  Inviting friends in the main menu works but when I start up the private world, they get kicked for not being my friend even though we're on each other's friends lists.  We've tried deleting each other and adding each other again after through the Fallout menu that leads back to the Xbox adding system like normal.  Nothing works, including making the world a team only world.  They still get removed for not being my friend.  Server crashes happen usually within 30 minutes of me being on the private server.  My internet is high speed.  The only things about Fallout 1st that have worked for me is the scrapbox and the emotes.
---
To an extent. Do you really have interest in revisiting areas from something as recent as Fallout 4, though?
---
A Peace sign emote would be cool!

Honestly, after watching this interview I feel much better about the dev team running things. I will say, even though they should still be able to work from home, I didn’t realize the entire team was working from home and I can understand a bit better why mandated release dates by the company higher ups has probably caused a lot of bad bugs when the team has no real time to speak with one another easily. My company has had to jump in and out of the office a lot, and while we are still working just as quickly, and lvl of interoffice issues take weeks rather than hours or a couple days to handle.
---
Really, if they just had a community manager do a Q&amp;A every other week or once a month over video chat and stopped doing inside the vaults, I would feel a lot more trusting. You can type any be you want and no one will know what you’re thinking, but these guys are just normal people. Get them in front of the screen and ask a question and their faces and inflection tells you everything. You can tell the difference between an unplanned feature and one they haven’t got to yet just by their tone when they say, “we’ll see...” hope they continue this.
---
Jeff Gardiner says that the BOS is coming "next year" which basically confirmed my theory that "winter" season would be 2021.
---
I could call you facist when that is better for you.
---
I like the German voice actor. It’s the same one that voiced Raziel from the Legacy of Kain games.
---
Huh? I would argue that the fact it had a craftable function, even outside(or especially because) the legitimate event period has a great bearing on wether it was meant to be craftable or ever will be again. My 2¢.
---
Thanks, though it say concrete now.
---
Doesn't the helmet look like an enormous turd, though? I thought there was a lot of controversy over how shitty it looked in-game versus what it was modeled as?
---
I, too, am still grinding just to unlock that outfit for my next character, though.  Just wish the helmet got a polish.

What about conversion toward flamer fuel?  Would 556 still edge out 2mm then?
---
I mean new vegas re uses building assets so i don't see the problem
---
I had two but when I got the radiation arch some purifiers turned off when I used the arch so now I have three.
---
I think the issue is Bethesda dumb
---
I would like that too.
---
Yea, i carry a vampire variant as my tagger In most events.
---
In 1-1/2 years playing, have never seen an explosive one.
---
The story is trash. This enhanced mod allows you to do what you want. There is extra characters quests and everything else in between. It also makes game incredibly hard and challenging. The early stages you have to think twice about trying to take 2 raiders. Each to their own though. Just made the post for those who are looking for something new until Bethesda release some actual content.
---
They’re still at the monorail, but I think people are farming it pretty regularly.
---
Maybe “rifle build” is more specific than I realize but weather you go auto or semi auto/bolt seems to make a big difference card wise.
---
Lol, I only have one point in charisma, and that's for tenderizer or stranger in numbers if on team. Yeah i was mentioning martial artist; Having super duper swing speed is great, feels like an oldschool hack n slash at how fast i can one shot a horde of charred ghouls! I found action boy helps out so much when switching to chinese stealth suit and being overencumbered. In full unyielding I dont use much for extra carry weight since i'll have about 361 to 386 ish room without any perks
---
Other than almost any weapon from WW2 I think the coolest thing would be the wattz laser rifle from fallouts 1 and 2
---
A new grind keeps the game fresh. I hope they are better guns/armor out at some point.
---
Be nice.

Motion assist servos (any PA) add +2 STR, which will help any melee build.

Same here.  Show up, act shifty, kill stuff then leave a bag.
---
Indeed! I freaking love that show too!
---
From all of the information we have on Daily Ops (which isn't much), I don't think that they are **only** going to involve the Vault Raids. We have heard they are going to be rotating daily dungeons, so it is likely that the Vaults are one of the possible Daily Ops locations, not the only ones.
---
I am highly wary of mod support. Best case scenario will be a curated 'mod' store where you can download and boot them in a modded instance that is separate from public and private server progression. Even then, that instance will likely require fallout 1st.
---
And this is the best case scenario in my mind...
---
I did the grind too, definitely worth it, but I got the Stealth suit first.
---
If anything, Bethesda should rejig Supply Drops to coincide with your level, perks, etc. I've got over 400 and the loot is too meaningless to ever pursue them, unless it happens to be near something else important. Even when the game first launched, I was pretty disappointed with the rewards.
---
“Maad Dooggg Maaloonnnee has eescapeed..”
---
definitely 15 in perception. At LEAST 11 in luck. And at LEAST 10 in AGI. Probably 5 in INT mainly for gunsmith.
---
assuming you're gonna be critting like a mofo
---
Even if the event sorta fails tho? That’s what confused me because I don’t think I’ve ever encountered this in past failed SE events.
---
HydroHomies!
---
It happened to me a couple of months ago.
---
Yay only a few more years!
---
Any details on how you fixed it?
---
Probably going to be bombed for this...
---
Apparently this isn't limited to 76. It's a thing in a lot of online games with hit scan weapons that hit large numbers. The difference is the degree of the HP rubber banding. Like Destiny 2 is supposed to be pretty bad, too.
---
Long short of it is, basically its the client and server arguing over how much damage was done. Client shows first, server overrules and 'corrects' it. We see it as HP rubber banding.
---
Wait a few seconds on the last confirmation screen. Usually works for me.
---
The only reason it’s in this game was because it was a thing they could copy/paste. And it doesn’t even make sense Th at it would be on the T-60, so don’t expect them to make it on anything else. The argument “I grinded for it” doesn’t work when you knew what you were grinding for
---
Well, unfortunately people like me exist, where I need to scavenge vendors for cheap stars just to hit scrip cap, anytime I play.  If I do get lucky and actually find legendaries &lt;Not even kidding, it took me almost 300hrs over 2yrs to get the kill legendaries trophy&gt;  its a 99% chance to be an exterminators wood arm.
---
  It's extremely, extremely rare that I get something that even remotely matters in the open game.  My vast majority of legends, that were all garbage but could actually get scrip, came from the recent fashnacht event.  Where my crown jewel, best item I've ever obtained came from mumbles during the last pure random sale, it was a Bloodied, Swing Speed, Reduced Weight Assaultron Blade, it took me a month to sell it for 8k caps.
---
I'm the living embodiment of percentile equality in all games.  For everyone that gets showered in legends, there must be another who exists in the opposite extreme of desert dwelling.  This is my lot in life.
---
Even the followers weapon daily, a lot report it as a guaranteed 3star, it is not.  I've got 3 months of 1 star troubleshooter pipe wrenches, and some 2 star boxing gloves.  I have gotten a few 3 star auto grenade launchers, of the bad VATs and Assassin's variety.
---
My primary weapon of 15months and counting, is the Resolute Veteran, from a challenge.  Its hot trash, but its literally the best max lvl gatling I've found, and its good on ammo.
---
The only people who know I play this are people who I'm friends with on Steam, and given I love FO games I bet you can guess that's not many people. lol
---
Thanks guys. Is it better to go auto? (might be stupid question but I’ve been out of the game a while)
---
Nah. Scrapper + West Tek + pick up all the guns. Should net about 1000 steel compared to the 1400 lead Lucky Hole yields with Excavator and Super Duper 3. Add the National Isolated Array and Huntersville and you're golden.
---
Alternatively, do Line in the Sand glitched, equip a tesla or explosive gun. if you manage to tag everything, you'll get several thousand steel.
---
Bumper sword
---
my assumption is the key thing here is - you won't be able to damage the space.  No enemies / no building damage.  And that hopefully simplifies it from their side
---
They do seem to really rare. I was shocked when I started playing and found one. Iv only ever seen a few players have them. Come to think of it iv only ever pulled a Thompson's from mumbles the clown but constantly pull various handmades. rng is weird like that i guess.
---
It’s the wasteland. Only losers care what their house looks like, everyone else is just trying to survive. Does it keep out the rain, and gives you some privacy? If it qualifies for both of those it’s fine
---
Just gonna convert it thanks anyway
---
Fallout shelters? So its going to be off server? Thats an ambitious list of things to break i wish you luck i know you can mess it up.
---
Add me if your interested
---
Beth with the save q/a now gib trailer
---
One wasteland or whatever is supposed to make eating and drinking optional if I remember correctly
---
Moddable private servers was one of the original selling points of FO1st so I doubt you’re wrong.
---
If they don't have special plans to the stuff, I really hope we can just have a droppad building for our camp, otherwise I kinda had enough to the offroad jogging championships
---
Share across players is a interesting system though, like when the game began you will saw it randomly popped in the starting regions often, which is a neat idea, they really should make more stuffs according to the concept
---
-------
---
(Tldr they can add more RNG™ and its a chance to add some 'pure stories that players will be happy and Bethesda don't needs to make many efforts, I mean, win-win!)
---
And for the unchanged contents in the box, I think they can add some depth to the maker(secret auto-factory I assume), like starts to adding holotape or notes of different stories, random items, and it's because due to the shortage to the resources, the supervisor, a Mr. Handy blamed the military lockdown seems will last a bit longer, which they finally forced have to improvise(adapt and overcome btw) and send force to collect randomly to suits their duty of providing stuffs.
---
Which just like how other bots doing stuffs in the Fallout world, they will starts to send some random stuffs that's having wider RNG™ happens(in game term btw), like 20 screws, 10 useless SMG(almost like you got many, but actually just dozens of steels/woods and 1 mod, not 2), 20 drills, ...spoil milks(was fresh when they packaging it) and radroach meats(just like the real factories, they will be sealed into the package and die for God's sake)
---
That’s extremely likely. They may change the cost ratios, but probably not the base system.
---
I don’t even bother with them anymore. There about as useless as all the 1 star drops I get off of 3 star legendary enemies
---
Yea that makes sense, its one of the best semi auto heavy weapons for sure tho
---
You said it pal, maybe not entirely but I feel like this was there goal all along , whiping out the dupers stashes
---
Damn, mine seems really op against high level enemies but my build is around heavy weapons tbh
---
Oh well
---
5 exploited ammo factories per fusion genny
---
They charge you like 2-3 days in advance for monthly renewals and your atoms won't show up until the day that your 1st actually ends/renews. It's really stupid.
---
Why the hell not? Any new content is welcome content.

This would be like GTA apartments, but with customisation expanded.

Crickets, Yao Guai, Snallygasters drop a healthy amount of acid. Just farm their locations and you should be solid.

I'd be happy with just making good with salt a perk where you add salt to the food to gain the effect on the item. Preferably with introducing a salt recipe or mineable salt nodes.
---
Man you blew her clothes off. What gun was that!
---
So how do you think that out of all those camps you have visited they are the builders? My camps are never one big house empty on the inside. You are making a statement without knowing anything about the subject. It's your opinion but not a fact. Get your shit together and try to be nice and not toxic, we will welcome you when you are.
---
I'm pretty sure bethesda also said that themselves multiple times
---
Were you eating any foods that heal over time , or had just completed guided meditation , these will cause it as well, because they are pretty much the same thing as healing factor
---
Industrial purofoers need 10 power each. I live on a small lake/large pond. Currently have 12 running (plus vending machines).
---
It is. And mine is a decent roll too, and I used it quite a bit. 
---
B/10dwa/fmswa. But I feel like its best in VATS, like one earlier comment stated, and I dont like VATS that much with heavy guns either. So in short, the weapon is just a miss for me and my way of playing
---
Very interesting!  I've noticed it gets better if I slow the shots down- perhaps the server has issues with multiple client requests when it hasn't had a chance to respond yet?
---
If you're okay with workshops, the Poseidon one has a spot to extract.
---
&gt; They want to phase out the random enemy level spikes.
---
I disagree with the removal of this bug. As a level 20 getting suprised by a level 50 scorchbeast, scared into a Hornwright Shelter until it got bored and left, then sneaking away to almost run into a level 50 sheepsquatch is still one of my best experiences with this game.
---
I've never felt as much tension since. Maybe the first time I ran into a wendigo colossus solo, but that's about it, and I killed that too. Never felt like I was horribly outclassed the way that SB+Sheepie combo did.
---
Great idea
---
Oh fuck yeah, make it possible to make them instead of doors
---
that was how it was the first time I used one. The drop was all the way over at Dolly Sod's, but I was only level 10. I tried to make it to the drop only to get killed by a couple cave crickets over and over. Somebody else finally saw the drop and killed the cave crickets so I could get the drop which I found wasn't worth it afterwards.
---

---
At low levels, I sold water.  Later, got the recipe for mentats, berry mentats sold like hot cakes! Now it’s Ammo and mutation serums.  I use 5.56 and sell everything else.  If your camp is in a low level area you will sell it all.  .45 sells immediately.  I was surprised how much fuel I sell.
---
Nunchuck
---
Tyvm!  This is great!
---
One stupid thing about the ranger armor for new Fallout 1st members is that you only get the base version. Every person I know that got fallout 1st asked about the other versions and it sucks telling them that they're perma rare for all we know.
---
Step 1: Don't.
---
If you however decide to claim a workshop, i'll nuke yo a$$ outta ma country
---
Well, there was a post where they talked about investigating that feature.
---
It's really a no-brainer, in my opinion, for the simple fact that they could easily sell more wallpaper if they offered this option, and it would drastically improve the options available for making your CAMP walls unique and interesting.  It's a win-win.
---
Still no word on how they are going to utilize the unfinished mansion in the ash heap?
---
We already have a mechanism for other players entering instanced locations. Ever notice when you're in a team and try to enter The Wayward of the Overseer's house, you get the option of entering the Team Leader's or Solo?
---
Not really no. I've hit the cap of 256 and now the game just says "You cannot carry anymore of this item."
---
I would like them to work on fixing bugs instead of continually pushing out newer buggier content
---
You should go tell your totally-real-and-not-at-all-made-up-fiance that you stalk random people on the internet because they said something you dont like. Ask them if that's weird.
---
When did they do that? I remember they did the Rick and Morty, Ninja, (some other guy) stream at the beginning of the game
---
Decon Arch is 30 alone
---
No I did not use the ammo factory exploit
---
I’ve noticed my Tesla doing a lot less damage when I use VATS.
---
What was this joke? I’ve been around since Beta but this one I must’ve missed
---
Bethesda just gotta extend this courtesy to every other weapon and bam - instant use for Supply Tapes. Them Atom Shop skins tho
---
Keep in mind that this is also a game where a giant multi-eyed frog licks radiation on you. The majority of this game is, as you so eloquently put it, fucking stupid. 😂
---
Plasma/Energy Revolver.
---
I sure hope it was me who did this to you
---

Source?
---
downvoted lmao
---
if you want them to care, dont be an asshole about it. the way this is worded makes it seem like fallout 76 is your entire life and this one little cosmetic is going to ruin your PaThEtIc little life.  the people that downvoted you downvoted for your whiny ass tone, not because they love bethesda.  grow up.
---
Exactly, I’m surprised they haven’t pursued it as an idea. Knowing Bethesda, it seems like something they’d prioritize over new Nuclear Winter maps or the thousands of bugs the main game still has.
---
Smoke grenades do exist in the game files. I’ve seen them hacked in on PC. I’ve never seen one in use, but I’ve seen it in inventory. There’s also this weird item called the GasTrap Dummy and Lucky Rabbits Feet which can be thrown like a grenade and picked back up after
---
Handguns are viable without junkies or bloodied. I'm doing great with my VATS Crit pistol build, and use a medic revolver as my main weapon.
---
Very possible...  
---
I have noticed that if the server is already really laggy, the rubber banding HP is absurd levels of WUT. And 76's servers are normally pretty fragile even under the best circumstances.
---
Using VATS tends to get around it. I assume it's because damage is per-calculated server side when you 'lock' to the mob.
---
Actually.....they just said that they are finding a way to let us switch from doorways to walls. They said nothing about this being able to allow for double walls again. My guess is they figured out how to prevent double walls while giving us back the door to wall switch.
---
Next community challenge: use fixer plans, explosive bobbleheads and bloodied explosive weapons to help the enclave
---
Fellow Konosuba fan?
---
Maybe it does matter. I'm using ps4 and u have there is no option to message ransoms unless u look up their player card(gamer card on xbox) to message them.
---
Yeah. I would expect that you Racist Amaricans stand togheter. Any Blacks shoot recently?  Looks like a Hobby of you kind.
---
VATS has been very hit or miss for me with commando builds against scorchbeasts and queens for a while.
---
Trust me, they are not as bad in retrospect. Some of the Possum are.
---
I was absurdly close to the cap limit the other day and used it. I think 5.56 was 3 caps a pop but had to burn a few and I was low.
---
I try to tank a pylon every single time and I still die within about 10 seconds.  I mash the stimpaks button and still die.  I wear power armor, still die.  If I was alive long enough for other players to get pylons and attack the sheepbot, then death wouldn't matter so much but that never happens because I die so quick.
---
I don't even get downed, I just full on get sent to respawn.  
---
I do pick it up again when I'm back alive.  I think I use about 25 stimpaks for one of these events if I'm pylon twice.
---
What can I do to survive long enough to be useful?  I'm trying very hard.  I'm junkie build so hp always at max.
---
YOU FKN SAID IT PAL

Easy solution - PvP and PvE servers for those who want and do not want to participate in PvP.

---
I’m excited for the camp interior door thing, but I guarantee it won’t actually come to the game until next year at the earliest :(
---
The chainsaw, buzz blade and ripper definitely need more love.
---
I can spare some.
---
Probly will in some way shape or form. But I feel good about this. They've been doing good lately
---
It probably depends on how much ammo you want to use.  Pretty sure Commando builds do more damage overall but I prefer Rifleman (pipe revolver) because I can one shot a few enemies then move position and one shot the rest.  If you have any interest in pvp then Commando is for sure the way to go.
---
I like how you think!
---
Hey Bethesda, DO THIS SO I CAN GET MY AUTOAXE please

Thirst zapper. I just wanna soak people for pete's sake

And bring the paintball gun back

i reached lvl 100 score 2 weeks ago, wasnt very difficult tbh. one guided meditation event got me nearly 1000 score. Throw in line in the sand and some west tek runs and afew sentry bots and it was pretty simple.
---
He's hiding in plain sight.
---
It happened in my mobile camp a while back. Normally I can move it and everything stays the same. One move emptied everything back in and I had to relist everything
---
I'd really poor? What execution. It hasn't happened
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed and your post has been removed.
---
I was hoping for 25, so I know it's not "some"  if there's anything I could trade you for it.
---
Nothing smells right anymore
---
I sided with me and kill both on sight. I’m very happy with the decision
---
No. It’ll probably be a underground bomb shelter type thing. A door we can put down somewhere. Not sure if we can build out rooms ourselves or if it’s more a decorate a pre fab room deal. They haven’t really said a whole lot about it yet.
---
This could've been such a cool endgame content.
---
Who else is excited that Steel Dawn is in the next patch? Because I sure as hell am!
---
We ship it tomorrow. 
---
But sir... this is just a test demo
---
I said it ships tomorrow!
---
I just upgraded my "super shorty" and put a long barrel on it, so now it's the "super shotty". It's so powerful, 33% hit chance on a shotgun is instakill
---
I don't think I'm going to be dumping any more resources into the event because the individual rewards are meh and the community rewards don't appeal to me, so I saved one box just in case we ever get to display them.
---
I added you!
---
Why does the bethesda client patch weights two times as much as the steam one?
---
Reminds me of my charizard in pokemon go. It's a dragonite, but he still looks like a diabetic charizard
---
Lmao no the drill
---
See you in the Wasteland!
---
what they have done so far
---
Please! That would be so nice
---
Great recommendations! Thanks. Was not aware of super duper perk. I’m on PC.
---
I've had the stuck in power armor bug a few times the past 2 days.
---
I totally thought this. Took me way too long to figure it out.
---
You see this is cool and all, but where's my .44 Bull Barrel and Thirst Zapper? 
---
These aren't things I want. These are things I ***neeeeed.***
---
the only thing they ever said was that the raid was being closed indefinably. they never actually gave any indication when it would return and in what capacity.
---
from the [ITV](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/1JYfTNnU3VcsSSIAdcuDWE/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-wastelanders-quest-ui-improvements-vault-94)
---
"Last year, we were excited to open the door to Vault 94 and bring you repeatable high-level content in the form of Vault Raids. Through community feedback we’ve received and our own monitoring since that time, we’ve decided that Vault 94 and its Missions are not delivering the quality of experience that we had hoped to provide. As a result, we are currently planning to shut down Vault 94 alongside the release of the Wastelanders update.
---
While that update is still a little ways off, we wanted to give you early notice so that you still have plenty of time to complete some more Vault Missions if you so choose before we seal up Vault 94 **indefinitely**. When the Vault is disabled, we are planning to make all of its rewards, including the exclusive Power Armor sets and Vault Steel, achievable through other means. We don’t have information to share on how and where you will be able to earn those rewards right now. Be sure to keep an eye out for those details when Wastelanders arrives.
---
Thank you to everyone who participated in Vault 94 Missions, shared feedback with us, and submitted bug reports. We’re looking forward to bringing more high-level experiences to the game in future updates."
---
Literally all the named npcs not being companions was a waste. I wanted that girl with the voice box
---
I. AM. WEASEL!
---
That's what I'm hoping for. I also expect it to be a big resource sink, probably needing a lot of the materials we're dumping into Atlas currently. Steel for frame and reinforcement, concrete for structure, cork for... Insulation? Or a massive wine cellar?
---
My camp is in an acid node so I’m not wanting for acid. I’ll try the recommendations that you and others suggested. Thanks!
---
&gt; They've been doing good lately
---
what world are you living in
---
I'd like that. Tasty squirrel stew!
---
That "your" bit was generalized. Not specifically aimed at you. 
---
You know them? They? As in the "builders". 
---
 100s of camps visited. I hit most anyone with a vendor station onnany given server to buy mats..... Dozens of camps a night. 
---
On top of the scores of camp images on Reddit and Imgur. 
---
Very rarely do you come across a notable camp. In concept or build. 
---
People are getting all fussed up about a trick they maybe used.... And didn't even do anything interesting with....
---
The outrage does not match the fix.
---
Considering how well Wastelanders went, I have good faith it'll turn out okay.
---
Where’s it say about double walls?  Wasn’t that fixed because it wasn’t supposed to be a thing?
---
Millenials don’t understand games
---
? Where does it talk about double walls?
---
Not likely; my 2c is it will be a trap door like in Fallout 4, and what they added at Freddie's House of Scares with Wastelanders.
---
If you are on PC, get the loot bag replacer from nexusmods, this will fix the issue.
---
I thought me standing on the ore deposit spot firing both ways and not giving a $&amp;@# was enough
---
Still waiting on that link btw
---
Oh they know, that's why they wanted them gone in the first place. They probably wanted to sell you double sided walls
---
It's already coming we just need to wait a bit longer
---
It’s for the daily challenge, buy or sell 3 things in player vendors.
---
Check your daily challenges.
---
Did they have those in fallout 4?
---
So uhh youve been 1/3~ of your 2 weeks playing?
---
Deez nutz
---
It's for the daily challenge about buying or selling three things from a vendor.
---
Thank you that makes more sense. Just kinda pisses me off though. Like I need caps.
---
I think we have it as a toy. It shouldnt be the main source of ammo we use to not f\*\*k up other sources like crafting or buying. Maybe it will be changed some way in the future.
---
I do similar to finish daily challenges. 
---
I'll generally spend a few hundred caps though. It's fun having people buy from your vendor. Not so much when it's 3 single bullets for a challenge 
---
So I'll generally find ammo or aid I need and buy a chunk of it instead.
---
Get that 25% exp buff . Hell yeah
---
It’s been part of the daily challenge multiple times to buy or sell 3 items from player vending. Lots of people buy 3 rounds of ammo at 1 cap to complete.
---
Yup, big carrot. If it happens, I’ll play the heck out of it but not getting excited or resubscribing yet.
---
See my edit
---
5,500 donated by me so far.
---
Anything we want to
---
I say only invest that many points in luck if you like to hit critical often. Otherwise better put the points into Perception for the all sneak perks.
---
Exactly like I need caps I buy and resell a lot but like I’ve had a bunch of stims just sitting there
---
Isn’t it on Xbox games gold?
---
May as well be free.
---
Yeah 20 bucks is totally worth it. I never group except for challenges so you can solo all you like.
---
hey if youve got any bloodied hunting rifles/lever actions id love to take them off your hands :) ive got some caps i can slide you as compensation
---
So you have to go shit on it online? Because it didn't live up to your standards? or that you didn't come across many "amazing" camps? My only question is why you shitting on people asking for something to be changed online, with such an unnecessary rude comments?
---
What happens if they fix the ability to swap doors to walls, but still stop double walls from being placed....
---
I HIGHLY appreciate this post. It's easy to forget how 1 fix can affect more than an obvious bug - regardless of the severity of the fix. Thanks for reminding me of this. The game is broken, but I still very much appreciate of the time &amp; effort the crew is putting in.
---
That's a kind offer. I don't really need anything, unless you have some spare Berry Mentats, I always need those, but if you want to add me to your friends list maybe I'll see you on the map. IGN Infernus_Joseph
---
1 sec, lemme check
---
If this is due to trouble finding them for fast travel, you can select them on the team part of the social menu without finding them on the map.  One of the options is to fast travel to them.
---
If it's not, then plus one.
---
LOL, "unintended" again. It's like when I told my ex-wife that my insertion of my dick in a chick I met on a cruise was "unintended".
---
Well we will have to wait and see how this will be implemented. Also wondering if they will allow us to build down again.  But after all the backlash and their unprecedented quick response im optimistic.
---
This is what I am concerned about as well.
---
Outfits can't be worn in Nuclear Winter alongside armor.
---
Today was quick, got it done in 30 min.
---
Give me a reason to wear my tin foil hat!
---
Ah yes, the nuclear wendigo

Edit: Fallout 76 fanbois when you talk smack about the game: [https://youtu.be/-GC5rAX0xHg?t=15](https://youtu.be/-GC5rAX0xHg?t=15)
---
Nope. I never leave any kind of comment on camp builds positive or negative, unless they do something truly creative and interesting. 
---
If I commented on every generic house I saw directly, it'd be a full time job. 
---
I will however overall bad mouth generic houses, physics defying single foundation houses, underground bases, and pirate ship builds.
---
Why am I bitching about this? Because BGS has more important shit to fix than a camp trick that makes boring camps....just as boring.
---
I want a speed bump as a backpack
---
Ps. To all of you also oin the negativity ttrain who said we were braking the game with trick and lagging servers. It´s clear from this response that this is not causing that, and thaat they want it to be in the game.
---
There is an update to VLC Media Player. Would you like to download it now?
---
It would be amazing for any future enclave dlc
---
That too. Forgot that one. 
---
100 Power goes fast.
---
Maybe you have the plan for The Fixer combat rifle (or a lv50 crafted one) I could buy?
---
No I have launched 100s of nukes they have always gone where i put the circle
---
Yesterday there was just under 10k in steam at peak.
---
The radio was way better without her
---
Keep it up.   The first one is the hardest.    If you stick with it you will get faster and faster.    
---
I am one of the few that have received a good drop from the queen.   One of which I have been rocking for 400ish levels.!   Keep at it.
---
X - Doubt
---
FINALLLLLY SOME INFO! 
---
I’m been wondering the most about daily ops I’m excited that it in fact going to be some kind of dungeon system
---
Inbefore Speed Demon nerf
---
I drop em  in front of train station vendors, then someone else can decide if they want em
---
Supposed to be winter but more likely next year
---
If they add pet's I want to choose it's name and be able to see other players pets name as well.
---
Sounded to me like they could do a system like with hearthfire from Skyrim. It was prefab structure, but they were different shapes which created different interiors based on the exterior form. Bunker sounds kinda contradictory to the point they were making that they wanted people to have cool exterior structures and still have an awesome interior.
---
Plus they were saying they wanted this to be an alternative to needing a larger camp budget. If we still don’t get to furnish our interiors properly, then a bunker filled with items seems pointless personally.
---
Thanks bud! :D Well, the majority came up from double XP weekend and combination of lunchboxes + herbivore (relish, etc). I did not really have to sit here 24/7 to do it. I just meant that it feels more like a chore than actual enjoyment.
---
ofc. what platform are you? as long as ur pc we're big chillin
---
As long as I have some kind of bunker I’m good. They can monetize all sorts of stuff with it. Hell they could even let us build our own vault again like Fallout 4
---
I have B25 lever action.
---
If they did that they couldn't "sell" it to you with the stupid score system
---
Not yet but I just looked it up and I gave a new anime to watch! Thank you!
---
I’ve had this happen to me since the battle pass. I have to be like super close to it to them for it to register. So annoying because I see the damage it’s supposed to be doing.
---
It was a super soaker filled with Axe deodorant!
---
I saw it happen in one of their commercials - so it must be true!
---
Well at least hey are half owning up to it.  But to be honest i actually believe they had no idea that this would happen. They were trying to patch the glitch that was used months ago to lag servers.
---
im on PC
---
Bethesda was too busy listening to all the whiners who didn't like being dragged into a teammate's pvp, so rather than make it so pacifist would stop that they decided to ruin legitimate team pvp and make it so even occasional pvpers can't help their friends.
---
No need to take pvp away, they just need to rethink some things.
---
like literally what the fuck is this person on lmao, i want some too
---
Honestly I think the counter is fake
---
I sell mine for 5 caps to low level players
---
I run 2,15,5,3,5,15,11
---
Same, got enough for the decon shower and stopped lol
---
I can give about 20 of it
---
So I have both perks is there a way to have them on to make them do more damage. I think I’m angry turtle video saying to apply on before the other but can’t remember
---
So, I'll see your saddled, laser-eyed Scorchbeast and raise you a Queen in Power Armir, that terror of Appalachia my son has been wanting for months now
---
You can still do double walls with doorways now
---
Totally get that. I think my issue is more that i was on   wave 3 of 3 and clearly doing that. 
---
I would have left right after that and really not cared that he took it.
---
But I didn't get the points for finishing the event.
---
Guess thats more what I'm whining about.
---
Yes! I'm so glad I'm not the only one! Saw that task and went straight to Freddie's Fear House all ready for some crazy clown wendigo action, then proceeded to look all over for that sucker. Finally re-read it and was like "oh, ohhhhhhh". Got it completed, but was completely bummed the rest of the night.
---
Hey I use my fancy shovel as a shovel
---
I didn't emerge from the vault to die at the hands of ghouls and mutants.
---
Also, this tactic is very popular in groups.
---
I tend to be on the "making complex games with regular updates is hard, and I still enjoy the game so let's be constructive in our criticism" side of the fence, but ...
---
... is it my imagination, or is the revamped ammo machine _worse_?
---
Ammo should scrap to components like anything else, period. Full stop. Do Not Pass Go.
---
Take the FO1 Scrap Box, make the Ammo Converter work like that. Done.
---
The only possible reasons I can think of are pretty weak. But here they are:
---
1) They want the small amount of extra loot from team-member-killed enemies at events like Uranium Fever or Radiation Rumble, so they want high level team members who will kill a lot.
---
2) They want better, higher level perk cards to be shared (although you’d think they could just wait and see what you actually DO share first).
---
3) They’re using Strange in Numbers and low level players are less likely to be running mutations (although it only takes one other mutated team member).
---
4) They want team members who are endgame optimized enough that maybe they’ll have the Empath mutation.
---
5) They think (whether correctly or not) that maybe high level players are more likely to settle down for a long play session and not leave the team so often, keeping the team bonus more stable at the full x4 level.
---
Just brainstorming. That’s all I could come up with. Or else 6) They just want the average team level to be high out of some weird sense of status or something and they’re willing to be a bit of a toxic dick about it.
---
Now you can have a cursed one!
---
Others have covered much of the gameplay etc. so I wont talk much about it. I generally like the gameplay, in a nutshell fo76 is really a large but shallow pool, lots to see but repetition sets in quite fast. Depending on who you play with your mileage may vary. But there is one massive caveat to Fo76, that is its monetization.
---
It is a AAA game that you pay for beforehand and yet it has more aggressive post purchase monetization than many F2P games I've played. Fo76 contains micro transactions, gameplay altering purchases (some would say p2w, but it isn't a pvp game so you decide), a subscription (with a really bad value proposition) and now a battlepass (which I'm kinda neutral on).
---
Many of the cosmetics are hugely overpriced, like recycled power armor skins from fo4 costing 10-15 bucks, with packs or premium skins costing even more. The game allows you to buy a machine that gives free scrap, as well as buy repair kits that allow you to skip maintaining your equipment. The subscription I find to be the really annoying part, especially as a big fallout fan. They received requests from the community for private servers, some special iconic armor, complaints about limited stash sizes and promises of mod support. And decided to lock it all behind a ***100$ a year*** ***subscription!***
---
I find the over-monetization obnoxious, especially since I paid 60$ for this game, only to have it flog a massive amount of overpriced monetization schemes at me. If I wanted to enjoy all of the game's features I'd have to pay 100$ a year for the privilege, on top of the 60$ I paid at launch. On top of which we add the cosmetic micro-transactions, which are too expensive for what they are (you could buy a really good game for the price of one low effort recolor). The battle pass, while nice, requires you to play long sessions almost daily to reach the final tier, which is a bit too steep of a grindwall as well (for me at least).
---
While a decent experience, albeit buggy as heck, it offers fairly little in exchange of for what it asks. If you can get it for cheap, sure go on ahead. I would still avoid spending too much on their in-app purchases though, they have gone overboard with their monetization and imo such behavior should not be rewarded (and the boardroom types only understand revenue and the methods that pay off)
---
This very weekend at quakecon
---
They should add a public team for workshops that enables pvp for the whole team.  Make it so a message pops up if a group is changed to this type so the anti pvp people can leave the group.
---
But if you’re building a large house that wouldn’t solve the problem of not having a build budget for interior objects in our builds, which it sounded like they had no plans to increase build budget and wanted to solve the problem of limited budget for our interior objects.
---
Yeah, some of it is that you lose the backpack. Part of it is some weight reduction legendaries. But the numbers *are* a bit opaque!
---
'I buy and resell a lot'. There's your caps issue. Players sell at the items worth / get rid of the plan or try and help new players. If you swoop in and buy all the cheap stuff and resell high you are shooting yourself in the foot and being a bother. Personally I have just been pulling a lot of plans off my vendor and dumping them at new players feet to stop resellers.

https://bethesda.net/community/topic/422724/update-on-replacing-walls-in-c-a-m-p?language%5B%5D=en
---
They wilm update us on the progress next week.  But they are working on it
---
ill def snag that. thank you! im a bit newer to the game, what does b25 stand for? im assuming the b is bloodied
---
my ign name is Tarrzan13, ill add you
---
And they expect us to donate stuff why
---
But when can we put wallpaper on windows :/
---
Meowabunga Fuckos for my fancy pump action shotgun.
---
&gt; do Line in the Sand glitched
---
What is this?
---
Do you think that money comes out of Bethesda’s pocket or the funds earned from 76?
---
B25 means Blodied and +25% fire rate =)
---
Sick idea. Or duel wield perk under str. “Wrists of steal” 😂
---
I’ve been dropping them for new players and low levels, I just drop a handful because they can probably use the supplies and the tiny bit of xp more than me and they’re not heavy to carry round like ammo or chems. Saves time putting a supply package together myself.
---
I hate the sound of my own voice as well, but sometimes it's much easier to respond with words rather than the simple gestures. On the rare occasion I've used my mic, they've all been good, courteous folks, and it feels like I can actually relax on a game for once.
---
Although I *was* horrified to find out that I accidentally had my mic on the whole week when I first played with a friend at launch. We were always in a call over discord, but everyone in game could hear **ME** talking to him. I didn't say anything embarrassing, but I did find it funny because at one point I just remember asking him if we should kill a couple of players we met, not knowing they could hear me.
---
PS4? If so I can give you a good rundown of the game!
---
Great pic!!!!
---
And Bloodbugs etc, scrap those Probosci.
---
Lol animal farm?
---
Yeah same I’m so confused why that happened. I always double check too before I launch so there’s no way I messed it up that badly
---
Will mod support come to consoles?
---
PC :( Thanks for the offer though!
---
You know what they say about big hands
---
yes
---
How about we just get power tool perks. For all the tools that need some love.
---
Woohoo!
---
I mean... if we can build it, then why can’t I hack them to not have to go fetch keycards? Especially when we factor in egg head and the legendary intelligence perk, and a baseline 15 int.
---
Hopefully soon too!
---
Atom be with us -.-
---
Okay now they really have my attention
---
 [https://roguetrader.com/#/](https://roguetrader.com/#/)
---
I think this Q&amp;A showed us the divide between the devs working on the project and Bethesda as a whole who has many different desires internally, plus lack of communication between devs and community managers.
---
Hearing the people working on this project directly gave me much more hope that they actually do care about this succeeding. Was good to know that Bethesda is moving more people onto this project for the upcoming DLC’s too!!
---
Ugh, you’re probably right. I got plenty of gold just waiting to buy them lol
---
God I love your optimism, hell yeah
---
You already learned from other responses that people do it for the daily challenge, but there is more to it if that's all that people buy from you: You don't offer much else of value to them. I'll usually check out two or three C.A.M.P.s for the challenge; if all I see is overpriced garbage or [known] plans, I'll buy three bullets from the last one. If your 5.56, .45, or 5mm ammo costs more than a cap a bullet, I'll do the same. If you price them at 1 cap, I'll happily buy all of them and make you happy.
---
Www.NukaCrypt.com/solved
---
You've got my interest Bethesda, dont fudge it up
---
I recommend maxing out intelligence right away, then work on your build later, it's a lot quicker. I just started a new bloodied commando character and made 115 levels in a week. 
---
Get into mutations early and don't use radaway, go for brahmin milk instead so you keep the mutations, craft brain bombs, cranberry relish and get addicted to Berry Mentats.
---
Line in the Sand really helps too.
---
&gt;  like the brew stations? Deposit ammo one side. Wait on it to process, ammo comes out ready for collection
---
Where are these?
---
Make shit cheaper then lol
---
Ok thats fair to complain about fr fr THATS vulture af but thems the breaks lol
---
Animaniacs?
---
&gt;I can see a dog finding random stuff and bringing it back (some wood a ball bone). A cat could bring back chicken meat as a gift. Maybe some yarn. 
---
And I can see a deathclaw bringing back rib cages, maybe even a human jaw!
---
Sure, and make sure to grab some punch for the punchbowl's.
---
so thats why I cant find an explosive flamer :((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((
---
Several bags of cement at the "Pylon" near foundations. Weights too just to make the trip worth it.
---
Or someone unaware of the origins of an item because they've still new.
---
Or dual wield one handed melee weapons at least. I mean Skyrim had it so....
---
I’ve definitely had invisible arcs, but my damage from the charging barrel on the arcs is constant and the same damage as max charge, even without charging.
---
What barrel are you using?
---
Gunslingers and Commandos can typically go together pretty well. I have an extremely optimized stealth commando but still have a viable gunslinger build on the same character. It just can’t handle stuff like the SBQ and Imposter Sheepsquatch well.
---
Razorgrain flour &amp; sunshine oil don't spoil, not much but it's something
---
Ooooh, didn't know that. Thank you.
---
What you are doing is really awesome. I don't need anything at the moment but I just wanted to make this comment. 
---
&lt;thumb's up emote&gt;
---
&lt;heart emote&gt;
---
&lt;accidentally stim packing myself&gt;
---
&lt;try to fast travel, encounter FT bug&gt;
---
&lt;awkward&gt;
---
Raiders.  More personality and more fun.  Ward and his stupid quest just sicken me.
---
Oop lol yeah I've done that in the past with different games. I did it in an RTS game bragging about my strategy to my teammate so I ended up getting hard countered and the other team at the end was just like "your mic was set to all" yeah I was red faced for a bit after that lol
---
the worlds full, would you mind joining a new world? i cant be on for too long
---
yeah sure
---
**Yes**
---
So I got guass mini first then shotgun and all my armor I had. So I went and bought plasma caster and the guass pistol. I used the caster for a little I can’t remember if I have any mods on it. But first roll of it I got anti armor. And it did fine and I liked it but I have a bloodied plasma gun and a two shot one that I rather use my plasma ammo for. I have gotten a berserkers from purveyor but I just scripped that one. Which mods are the best for it? And which one did you roll and use
---
Theres a daily challenge for buying or selling 3 items to other players. I don’t have a vendor at my camp because I don’t sell stuff. So I look for people that are selling ammo. I go and purchase 3 bullets. One at a time. To get my challenge done.
---
You can through any wall to be honest, so it's not like that's any different!
---
I can’t help with the word - they are often very obscure words ... closer to he end of the cycle (tues morning) the entire word will be revealed if you can’t figure it out by then.  
---
have you done the side quest suggesting you investigate mama dolce’s? Yet? 
---
If you don’t want to go through and do it properly there are places (websites) that people post each week’s codes very early on in the cycle ...
---
let me know if I will be able to help you friend =)
---
Thanks, much appreciated. I'll look out for you the next time I'm on
---
k
---
 Been noticing the same thing. My bloodied ffr fixer used to melt them, now it doesn’t so much at first.
---
I feel like feral ghouls are ultra weak to explosive damage, like it feels like it does 5x dmg.  Even at lvl 25ish it was really easy laying into them but ya I died a bunch of times but it wasnt insanely difficult
---
I think so, certainly enough add to your friends list and get in on the SBQ when they run silos.
---
True
---
There's endless comical potential with this I swear
---
Yes, community managers and devs need to work together more to get the thoughts, ideas and hopes of the community to the devs, either more or more effectively. Another thing I must say I am glad is getting across is mod support, that I am very much looking forward to on the PS4 and hopefully PS5 in the future. I am glad to see that the people who work on this game care about their goal with making this a 7 year long game (or something like that when they were initially talking about it before release).  I like the DLC and seeing that the BoS is coming gets me excited that they will work on the Enclave next most likely and hopefully the Responders will get a revitalization! Expand and reinvigorate the wasteland! I very much look forward to the Expeditions and hope they expand on the idea and let us go to different states hopefully.
---
Chat mod and SFE were last updated on July 25, which I think was before patch 21.
---
Are you sure it's not a player with the user name Former Raider? There must be one on each platform...
---
Bonus fun fact: Ward too is a former raider, and I always know where to find him now. ;-)
---
Yup! It was one of the cartoons that I grew up on.
---
From the camera angle I didnt get to see team mate much, she was just stood there with weapons ready when the fight started.
---
