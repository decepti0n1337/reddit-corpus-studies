Yea having a backpack is a major help 
---
Good on you friend
---
---
---
I'm just curious if that daily cap is going to be per character or per account? I've got 3 cap mules that also have over 1,000 pounds of missiles and mini nukes on each one. Would love to dump crap ammo from each character every day to speed the process up.
---
Oooo ok I actually see what you are saying. I initially thought the other person finished the repairs, instead of just restarting the reactor. Yeah I can see why that'd be frustrating.
---
Ok so it seems that the mechanic is you have to sell a specific amount of the ammo to be granted points. That is in the "count" column. So for the .38 you get 20 points for 18 bullets, wich means each bullet gives you 1.11 points. 
---

---
Then to buy 2mm EC you need to spend 300 points to buy 15 charges. Each round costs 20 points.
---
Basically 18 .38s gets you 1 2mm. But youll need to sell 18 .38s 20 times to buy the 2mm
---
Yeah not 100% sure, mentioned in another post about doing under 100 damage to queen herself and still getting body loot, somone said minions work too.
---
Use the repair kits from the queen, I haven't repaired at a workbench for a very long time. 
---
PA is even better, I've only ever repaired one leg once lol.
---
Are you on PS4? As I have them.
---
I too use a Gatling Gun. But i think it would look better in an energy weapon.
---
would have been awesome
---
I actually NEVER crafted bullets in NV hahaha. I bought everything cuz weapons sold for crazy amounts.
---
Which weapons?
---
It's kind of nice but all the "secret" stuff is lost on me since every one knows the secret haha but it's good for roleplaying.
---
Yeah i have at least 40 repair kits from the SBQ. And yeah, power armor seems to NEVER go down in durability
---
I saw someone else just ask this same thing. Very intersting indeed. But if I had to guess its going to be account bound
---
You are correct
---
That's fine, don't worry! I probably could've explained myself better there.
---
Well if that is the case then the same 20 min, but I have spent far more time server hopping trying to find scorpions, etc on some days.  Easy to do while doing other things though so I agree, but I was hoping for a change.  Anyway we will see.
---
Bloodied is a % damage boost based on your percent of missing health, up to 90%.  Junkies is 10% per addiction up to 50%.
---
If you're under half health junkies is just going to be flat worse than bloodied, no hybrid could be better.  If you'd rather play with more than half health junkies is better.
---
Me.? well, if there were only the two builds in the game I would chose Junkies for full health despite the fact that Bloodied can do more damage.. 
---
once youre already 1 shotting max lvl mobs for almost 2x their HP.. its not like you can kill them more..
---
if I was going to spend all my time grinding SBQs and Encryptid.. I might make the Bloodied just to end them quicker
---
i bought the recipe for it for 3k caps a few days ago i think. Could have swore i had it, but im missing so few plans im like eh what the hell.
---
That is sad then....  but oh well I was hoping a bit less of that and more just exp, but oh well.  As others have said then Atoms seem more of a reward
---
I currently have a bloodied commando build with full unyielding and a bloodied heavy build that uses PA. Wondering if it’s worth getting some addictions and investing in some junkies weapons
---
Turrets and crops make sense then. Still, displays remain useless and quite limited compared to what they should be. Hope this instanced c.a.m.p. system will add to variety of camps, without breaking stuff that works now.
---
Yeah, me too. Also arrows and bolts.
---
There’s hardly anyone of them because that’s all you could do, Grief. Tricking someone into pvp is literally peak raiding
---
That’s cool I’ve got a boat load  of 5mm to get rid of. It just sits in my vendor I think I’ve got close to 25k rounds of 5mm
---
I always tought the ghillie armor are just too creepy. Makes sense if you're on The Mire but for me definitely looks very out of place everywhere else.
---
For the heavy yes because of magic weapons, for the commando bloodied is the best.
---
He left a "sweepstakes winner" note in there so...I hope not rofl
---
Sadly there is but you can get around it by converting to max, than spend all points and convert to max again.
---
I want the fireplace door, just to put in a fireplace, I've always wanted a nice fireplace. If someone opens it and falls to their death, that's on them.
---
Believe theres a cap of 2000 points, should be a cap on total held at a time to deter hoarding rather than a daily cap.
---
Nah, all I'm asking is that players like you do the decent and responsible thing and take your vendors offline when you're near the caps limit. All it takes is deleting a wire or two, it's not difficult and it's certainly not too much to ask. Sure, if you want to be an inconsiderate prick, by all means be one, but don't get upset when someone like me calls you out on it.
---
The last two times I saw him, he was actually at Foundation &amp; The Crater. He has a route around the map apparently, I've seen him on the road behind Whitesprings Station, at Charleston station, in Helvetia during Fasnacht, and at Big Bend Tunnel on both ends of the tunnel. Good luck!
---
It's kinda weird that you have basically confirmed everything I've said, yet somehow disagree with each point.
---
I did clearly say in my post that the only players left are those who truly love Fallout, and are people who want others to like it too. Every other player has left ages ago for less buggy games.
---
&amp; I never said that what Bethesda has done is good, I'm just saying they are a big reason as to why the community is so good.
---
Maybe the Raider mask is nice but i love so much the Rare Red Crazy Guy Mask from Fasnacht that i only use it.   
---
I really don't like hoarding cosmetics in my stash box. I prefer to roleplay with my favorites.
---
Yes.
---
I'd say that anyone who lists items at 15k has no right to complain about buyers taking them over the caps limit. Simple as that.
---
Same. I found a legendary fatman that weighs .6 after all my perks, so naturally I was launching mini nukes EVERYWHERE after Fastnacht events
---
❤❤❤
---
That’s what got me considering using both, but I heard they’re patching those on Tuesday
---
EXACTLY.
---
I have the Bone Rider and the Black Rider PA Skins. They're my favorite and i've never seen any better on the ATX. Maybe the Nukashine one in the X-01 is also a favorite.
---
I don't really care for goofy stuff. The raider mask is kind of nice but not worth 100h\~150h of grind.
---
As someone who was adamantly against going bloodied and recently did let me tell you: bloodied is awesome. I actually feel tankier with my defensive perks than I was with my junkie with all damage perks. And you don't NEED to be under 20% health. I keep my rads at 30-40% health and when it gets under 20 that's just a bonus. If you have a full set of unyielding gear then go ahead and use your junkies weapons. A little less damage and a couple fewer special points from addictions, but still OP.
---
I just like funny stuff for my camps. I've made a free mutations booth at one that has an electric chair on a pressure pad that sets of a rad emitter when you sit in it. I'm also quite excited at the prospect of having a sink.
---
the only thing Im stoked for is Perk Card Packs so I can spend them on Legendary Perks..
---
to a lesser degree Im interested in the currency rewards.. but not for the reasons you might think..
---
Im anxious to see what happens when people start earning scrip or other capped currency and they are at max.. and dont get it.. thats gonna create some irate reddit posters Ill tell you what..
---
the cosmetics and camp stuff I have no interest in..
---
Im all about the Perk Card Packs and the pittance of Atoms they graced us to leave in as rewards...
---
This is true im a level 37 and I give weapons and armor close to there level
---
But you can just throw on outfit over like the mountain scout for urban and then have the ghillie on the armor when your out in the trees and what not
---
Yeah, my point was just that the community has always been good(even before the game, but we just did not know it) and Beth is just fucking it up.
---
I should not write when I am this tired.
---
[deleted]
---
Oh youre right! That mask looks VERY cool.
---
I would say you can keep one mask stashed and not be considered a hoearder yet, hahaha
---
If they are I’m not sure but I’d probably still go junkies in pa so you are more tanky
---
There is a guy on YouTube named angry turtle who demonstrates both builds....It pretty much comes down to this man. Junkies kills most things with 2 shots, bloodied uses one shot. I’m bloodied but since they changed junkies it’s tempting to have a junkies character. Rad management can be slightly annoying lol. Plus you could probably still use the cards that tank you up and still be a tank if you’re hp dips low.
---
hahah yeah, i should've figured it would be used for those pranks. I can already see the YT videos
---
Check the Discord in the sidebar. They have channels for each platform to help you party up.
---
Yeah, I'd agree with you on all points pal, but Rose the stupid Angelica from Rugrats sounding robot detracts from the game for me...
---
i didnt realise he went to the faction bases. Maybe Ill try hanging out there for a bit and see if he will stroll in. I think I just have appalling luck. Either that or Im not spending enough time waiting. I might just hang out at Foundation and try that. Thakns for the tips
---
I had that happen before with a mirelurk horde in the Mire, the boss was stuck inside of an inaccessible room in the Hotel Salon. But, after waiting for a while like you're doing, eventually he came outside.
---
It's not so bad anymore.  Even when Whitesprings was the most nuked spot in the game I still had my camp there and only had it destroyed once when I logged into it right before the nuke hit.
---
Do you have to be a certain level to get a fixer drop? I’ve never got a one. I have fixer plans but other than that I’ve never seen and from the purveyor or events? I’m level 98
---
Most people are likely still going to spend atoms in the actual shop, I’m so sick of the “this is the last straw” act.
---
I go around seeking out low level players to assist. If they accept my team invite I will carry them through areas to level them up, give them what I can. A week ago this level 30 seemed to be having trouble. Over the course of 3 days i managed to help him to level 45, made him a full suit of X-01, gatling plasma with 30 plasma cores a few other weapons and a butt load of various healing chems. Makes me feel good to help people out because when I started playing it was high level teams hunting newbies down and I dont want that to happen to others, acting kinda like a wasteland defender at times.
---
For sure!! The next scout rank is squirrel I believe.
---
It's either that or a "Omg you guys are so nice &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3" post.
---
Great idea!!
---
Right? I’m bloodied rilfeman and I’ve often wondered how redundant all my dmg is. I’ve played with junkies and the only time we notice a big difference is with the imposter sheep. I can kill her extremely fast, less than 36 shots. I can’t pylon worth a damn tho so that’s a big negative.
---
You just have to pay attention and always check the map when a nuke drops. If it’s coming your way, time to server hop.
---
Thank you for the first location I was actually headed to do this quest and wanted to move my camp to a more discreet area and this is a little hidden gem. I've never seen anyone build here ever and it's a lovely little place c
---
I respectfully disagree with your disagreement. They can simply retexture and rename the armor pieces, they were already planning to do this since the armors were in the Wastelanders PTS and supposed to be worn by blood eagles. Furthermore, they're not lore breaking - They're rudimentary scrap armor that anyone could come up with.
---
Another great place to find wood is pricketts fort, if you look around the cabins in the main fort, there's a wood shed with ~170 wood plus all the wood from wood piles in the fireplaces
---
True, I just wasn’t paying attention
---
I'm surprised they haven't with how popular camp building is. One of my favorite atom shop purchases is the Thanksgiving display.
---
It's Riot Armor from before the war - The NCR didn't create it.   
---
If you look at the Ranger armor closely it says 'Charleston PD' on it.
---
U able to handle a room by yourself
---
They absolutely should and I'd buy them.
---
I couldn't care less for clean sinks but i do love your rad emitter contraption!  
---
I just wish they gave more attention to the advanced power connectors and fixed all the bugs.
---
I'm deeply frustrated that the pitches from the powered speakers reset when you log off.  
---
I've built a [Jazz machine](https://imgur.com/gallery/ObXIBIy/comment/1893452859) to play [Giant Steps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62tIvfP9A2w) but it's useless 'till the speakers bug fix.
---
I’m so sad I missed out on that one
---
Moat likely, because these shitty servers arent able to handle the stress of large numbers
---
Ya, major mistake on their part not having it available all the time.  I'd argue it's probably one of the best selling things they have put out. Very versatile.
---
It's a random encounter, an eyebot playing music and leading a bunch of passive radrats
---
It's pretty cool :P
---
A good spot to get it is the Charleston train station, run across the red bridges and back and it will usually spawn an encounter, it could be this, responder bots, or even the robot trader that sells the Hunter's Long Coat and stuff
---
What, you don't even want to mention that post gold grind anything you make is bound to that character so you can't even sell it?  This essentially destroys the long term viability of player vending useful weapons/armor outside of "random drops" and Purveyor purchases.
---
I did it today way alone stocking 1 bay so at least I could get the completion so I got the lev3 deathclaw then 3 or 4 lev 200 to 300 show up dont help guard any of the animals then melt the alpha before I could get a shoot off.  I did all the work and got nothing to show that's why I wont be anymore.
---
Either people dont know how it works or they dont care and just want the legendarys
---
Pc controller gang
---
I'd buy the crap out of this.
---
I know it!!  I think everyone would!!
---
True. Anyway iI dislike them but i can see why people like them. Definitely one "no-bullshift survival-related" cosmetic.  
---
I think i just wish they would give us like all the Ghillies at some certain rank and add different cosmetics in other ranks.
---
Lol, and they took the effect from the radical mask, someone with a full set of that armor,emergency protocols and lone wanderer perk card has 97,68% damage reduction and what's left gets handled by the damage resistance, you can call an orbital strike on him and he will just get tickled.

Wow haha that looks cool! Ill keep an eye!

Please tell us the legend of the dark times lol

Go right to your CAMP unit. Click repair all. Prosper.

At least he has something to look forward to lol
---
This is great and very creative. I love the use of the bar pieces especially.
---
yes
---
Any chance you're on Xbox?
---
If you are, go to the friends tab in the console menu and you'll see a section that says "recently played with" or something along those lines, you might be able to find them in there it's just not 100% perfect
---
With the free atom nerf I think we’re seeing a page turn here.  We had things pulled out of the patch for polishing/reworking.  We’ve seen what certainly felt like a long, serious attempt to fix vendor and duping issues.  It’s a change in direction, perhaps the game is being given the attention and resources it needs, perhaps Zenimax is laying down the law, perhaps both.
---
However I think the big storms are still coming.  We have the one Appalachia and the weapon rebalance.  Is everything going to become bullet sponges for low XP?  Will explosive energy weapons finally be addressed?  Will some year long bugs finally get fixed?  Stay tuned!
---
Looks cool. You also might wanna check out r/fallout76settlements
---
Excellent.  Thank you sir.  Mods now work with steam version.
---
I'm not sure but I definitely linked when they were at least
---
just you
---
If you work your way through the notional main story line you'll get the plan from a vendor in a "bunker" don't wanna spoil but keep truckin you'll get it
---
I just dipped i didnt want them to shop and possibly reward that act yah know? So i didnt get their name sorry
---
Because all the rewards were heavily duped and made worthless. I used to do that event eveytime and post on lfg when it popped.
---
imagine how much worse it was when the person trolling you was sitting right next to you on the couch.. lol
---
I’ve been working on it on and off since the beta lol. Rage is real
---
The ghouls in the barrows don't drop stabilizing materials.
---
I'm genuinely not upset friend, I understand your point of view and do not disagree with it. I actually have a switch installed to shut down my shops with the assumption it would prevent them from functioning completely. Unfortunately all that does is remove the map icon. The shops and the items within are still acessible. Additionally, I have placed my C.A.M.P. in a low traffic area to increase the effectiveness of my "off switch." The reason I posted any response was simply to let you know, due to an abundance of flaws in this game, the amount of time and effort involved in posting only leaves one time efficient answer - abruptly logging off when near max caps. So as it may feel rude to you, asking me to take a loss or to spend more of my time managing caps and inventory when it already is quite a large part of 76 endgame, could be viewed as equally rude.
---
To be frank, suck it up buttercup you're not the only one inconvenienced by the system in it's current state.
---
Geez id be upset i mean i understand like friendly trolling but if they went all out thats another story lol
---
most of the big events do have a notification
---
Wait. Berets are rare now?
---
Sadly, the \_bright\_ headlight doesn't seem to be available. Unless it's a mod dropped by a Scorchbeast or something.
---
Done that to my wife in wow back in the day... played NE rogue and she was horde, stalked her without her knowing and kept wrecking her lol
---
Same. I don't mind the other stuff, but it doesn't seem that interesting to grind for anything else.
---
Compulsive collector here. Working on picking up all the different plans. At this point all I really have left are PA mods, most of which run from 1k-5k per plan.
---
When I need to dump a bunch of caps all at once I pick up Serum recipes that I am still missing (have all the worthwhile ones, but I figure why not just grab up all of them eventually).
---
Smiley and his 6k a week for Gold Bullion.
---
Buying bulk junk. Particularly junk that can't be bulked by player characters themselves (ammo scrap, ballistic scrap, circuits, crystal, screws, etc).
---
Weapons, armor, and outfits. I have taken to picking up good items for alternate builds or items I just want to screw around with when I get bloated with caps.
---
I don't think it exists. I just built a T-65 helmet, and compared the headlight to my X01 Bright Headlight mod. No comparison-- the X01 light is much brighter. T-65 needs a mod for this.
---
I'm pretty much in the same spot as you in the NW hills looking over the course. Only been nuked once since being here. Been here for like 6 months. Just bad timing mate.
---
I'm worried any change now will be too late. The recent post showing steam numbers is highly concerning. 
---
If people enjoy the core game, then all the issues you mention matter. Players need to actually like the core game, want to play it, for them to care about how they play it.
---
If there is no **why** then it doesn't matter **how**.
---
The chicken coup claims to only provide fertiliser, so it's just the brahmin but worse? Hope we get eggs too!

---
Nope.
---
Awesome thanks for the tip
---
That is the easiest way for sure, but you could go to Fo76maps.com and it will show you where all FC spawns are. Not sure what platform you are on but if you're on Xbox you could use my private server and hold all 3 power plants for a bit and get tons.
---
I just started my hunt for the red one yesterday. Is it really that rare? I've found 2 brown ones and that's it.
---
That doesn’t explain why I get quad capacity pipe rifles.
---
Thank you. I am so tired of people using “but ranger armor” as an argument.
---
Don’t criticize the lore friendliness if you don’t know the lore.
---
RNG
---
Thanks! I was looking for building related subs but didn't see one.
---
That clean sink looks good, but that's at a fairly low level as well. Perk packs might be useful depending on how substantially they revise their plans for legendary perks. But yes, you have to really like cosmetic items to think that the rewards are good.
---
Not me. I'm an Explosive Build so that's my primary source of grenades and nukes :( guess I'm switching builds
---
RNG is RNG..
---
the game has no way to know what one person desires over another...
---
So how was the couch on the night of wreckening ? Lol
---
Grahm sells the plan For about 240 caps.  IIRC, so does one of the WS vendors.  IIRC,, so does one of the other bot vendors, I just dont remember which one,
---
That said, I suggest learning where the PA spawns (and the static core spawns) are located.
---
THere are events that reward cores, they are  sometimes found as loot, sometimes loose in ammo cans or duffel bags. 
---
I have not taken a power plant in well over 150 levels and have what some people would probably call a stupid large number of fusion cores.
---
I think it could be the rarest outfit in the game. I've heard it has a 1 in 10000 chance of spawning. 
---
I don't know if you know the rough prices but this what i found on my internet travels.
---
 
---
White dirty/Withered - worthless
---
White Clean - up to 500 caps
---
Brown - up to 1k
---
Blue - up to 3k
---
Green - up to 5k
---
Pink - 10k+
---
Yellow - 12k+
---
Forest - 20k+
---
Red - trade only.
---
Got all but last 2
---
Can’t wait to get started!
---
Vampire is a must have no matter the build. I used it as a secondary unless I was going against really tough enemies.
---
I know that but I mean project paradise for example, if you start that on your own, even if the server is full of high levels usually not a soul shows up to assist you.
---
This happened to me. I had preoredered the game. It was awful at launch. Every human player I met tried to kill me. Every singke one. I played 3 times. Dropped the game for a year and a half. First time picking it back up I met Noblefish29. She made me armor that last 20+ levels. We ended up being very great friends. I no longer player 76 because it sucks but we are still great friends
---
because its a drag.. lol
---
not because no one sees it
---
Wow. You must be a lot of fun at parties.
---
Technically speaking from what I've seen: 
---
They LARP doing: 
---
- patrols/act in character 
---
- full-on mission briefings 
---
- Utilize squad/fireteam tactics
---
- Ask new potential recruits questions  (Like how the actual military does it at a Recruitment Center)
---
- A training regimen
---
- Physical Training courses (Fireing range etc)
---
- Full on fireteams/squads utilizing callsigns.
---
- Created content
---
The list goes on.
---
u/Nymith is definitely among one of the best out there, he's one of the main inspirations for me creating my own Brotherhood of Steel group for Xbox with the same ideas.
---
Sadly nearly everyone complains about 'Why no mutations?' even when i give a logical explanation. 
---
I guess most people are only into the Brotherhood of Steel for the snazzy armor? 😃
---
All in all the real Roleplay communities are very welcoming/coordinated. I like it, i actually in fact plan on doing Twitch streams of my groups Roleplay adventures/patrols. 
---
It does suck that Twitch only keeps videos up for 14/60 days instead of permanently like how YouTube does.
---
Yeah good point that event sucks.
---
This.
---
I mean speed demon puts you at cap for speed, so if flying is more important than the -20% I'd say get the jetpack
---
It multiplies in your inventory, and the quest only removes one.  But the quest doesn't trigger until you pick up a new one, so the extras are of no use.  
---
They vendor at 1 cap each, so when you don't have the quest available, sell the rest.
---
Nope. You just place it down and you're good to go. The placement can be a little janky sometimes, but it goes down eventually.
---
I'd say it's great for the lower levels when you aren't making crazy junk runs. You can go out and quest for a bit, then come back with a good haul to supplement what you pick up in the wild.
---
if i ever go I do so with no intention of getting any good reward.. I just go to slaughter lots and lots of mobs..
---
its definitely good for that
---
Same here deadhead1044
---
It's all useless. The quest will now only proc when you find fresh data. The duplicates are a known glitch and the only thing you can do is dump or vendor them.
---
Ad Victoriam!
---
Damn, I did not know they were so rare/ expensive! Do you know why people are selling the vault 76 jumpsuit for thousands of caps?
---
Interesting. Is it possible to put them in display cases? If so I might just build a bunch and put them in those for the time being.
---
Since the game doesn't know what you want, there's no way to have it be 'more lucky'.  You may want a bloodied fixer, I may want a junkies .50 cal.  No way for the game to distinguish who wants what.
---
Semper Victoriam! (Always Victory)
---
Not really missing out. Literally says he only needs to farm one type of flux for the most part and Morgantown is the best place for them. What’s good for you is not the best for them.
---
Getting all three animals to stay alive solo is almost impossible. But I agree it’s good for just slaughtering lot’s of mobs.
---
I don’t know maybe they just give the more valued effects
---
He’s also exaggerating how much he gets from Morgantown bud.
---
Thanks
---
I'm kind of roleplaying as myself and how I think I would react to a Fallout-like world. 
---
My character is a Free States guy. He doesn't trust the US Government and thinks anyone who has access to unchecked power will abuse it. My guy was a staunch supporter of Senator Blackwell before the bombs fell and didn't exactly trust Vault Tec; however when shit hit the fan, he thought dying out in a new, unknown world was a waste and went to the Vault anyway in hopes of emerging and helping to rebuild civilization.
---
He's a survivalist, and will use anything available in the wasteland to ensure survival - chems, mutations, you name it.
---
As far as weapons go, I use a two shot double barrel shotgun until I can find or roll a nice bloodied shotty (no luck so far). For armor, I'm wearing the insurgent outfit with the Raider pathfinder mask until the FS survivalist outfit comes back in the Atomic Shop.
---
My base is a FS garage/Red Rocket diner near the Overlook Cabin. My vending machines take on the appearance of gas pumps and I have a diner connected for other wastelanders to come in and have a meal. I tried to model it after gas stations &amp; restaurants that are prevalent where I'm from in the South.
---
Considering I drop everything you just named and also shotgun shells, railway spikes, arrows, and bolts bad conversion rates don't seem so terrible.
---
How can it tell what you value though?
---
Not a clue, it never occurred to me to check.
---
Would anyone want a exterminaters pipe pistol with bash damage?
---
Alright. I'll try it out myself and then update.
---
Shaddup with this, it was awful for a couple months, repair after every few fights needed.
---
Yes. I have my camp set up over a junk deposit and I also have my collectron running. Every few days I accumulate tons of random junk like cork that I never use, so I bulk it and sell it to vendor bots for decent money. Plus it has a chance of generating rarer junk like ballistic fiber scrap that’s very handy for repairing armor and annoying to scavenge for in the wasteland.
---
Not seen that
---
Look at Elder Scrolls Online for comparison.
---
They both share the same monetization model and both have had rocky starts.
---
Thanks for the Swift information btw.
---
Thanks for the Swift answer.
---
well ig i wasn’t playing at that time. lol
---
Given how you could decorate houses in Fallout 4 with objects from the wasteland, I wonder what the technical limitations are for Bethesda in Fallout 76 that prevent junk dropped in a camp from reappearing as it looked when you picked it up rather than just a paper bag with an inventory.
---
Bethesda had to reset my quest, and it worked fine the second time around
---
&gt;These problems also weed out many of the shitheads. Only players who  truly love the idea of Fallout will remain in this troubled game; those  who are just looking for a quick &amp; easy experience will move on to  other, less buggy games.
---
The common wisdom also suggests this is why Fallout 76's community started off in a positive way from the start.  The many issues the game presented basically caused all of the "cool kids" to flee for a different game, whereas those who were more patient and pragmatic remained.
---
Which is why it's all-the-more troubling whenever Bethesda does things to slight us, like nerfing the daily/weekly Atoms, or the stingy way they've decided to implement Legendary Perks.
---
As soon as my luck finally becomes good again I ruin it

Rifle Gaming has dropped a nuke on every marked location of the map - and more than a few of the unmarked ones.
---
Probably just because unless it's a camp object anyone walking through could grab it. In fallout 4 you didn't have to worry about other players.  Lol. I'm sure thats the hang up.
---
I saw it twice now. I thought they knew something I didn't. Ha

Pumpkin house should be the Griffith house in Kenova or its neighboring town, don't know of it's technically across the town border. The town carves a couple hundred pumpkins there around Halloween each year. There is a pharmacy in kenova called Griffith and Fiel that was owned or co-owned by the family who owns the Griffith house. Camden park is only a couple miles or so away on the path to Huntington. The pharmacy had an old timey renovation a decade or so ago, and if they still have it they put in an old pharmacy fountain, so of you ever find yourself there you might stop in and see of they still have it and get a good ol fountain drink. Also a personal favorite, which you can find around the state in a few places, check out Gino's Pizzaria. They have a pretty beast pizza bread, which is basically a pizza sub. Boy I miss being back home. Lol
---
Thanks! I love dropping off like welcome packages for lvl 1s coming out of the vault. Most don't even realize what the package in the ground means lol
---
I wouldn't say no, but at the same time, as I'd like to believe the popularity of the Fasnacht Deathclaw Mask demonstrates, not everything needs to be a toony, oversized mascot head either.  It's okay to make something a bit more realistic.
---
Pls
---
This doesn’t exactly help. But there’s enough there to make my case already, this just adds to it.
---
You can thank the god mode glitch for this. You can stack up on bobble heads and just to a crazy amount of damage. It happened to me recently.
---
😂😂
---
Hell yes! And the best part is we doing have to grind for it!
---
First of these?  Can't wait to see your 10th!  This is better than most 50th's.  Great great job building something so creative.  The suitcase staircase is a nice touch
---
The community is overhyped by themselves Imo
---
Dont forget a new rep grind as well.
---
Rad frog on your back with the fleshy holes
---
I think there's 2 or 3 turrets in halls that don't get turned off. Or maybe I just never found the right terminal. Either way, I would carry a gun even with a melee build.
---
The queen is the only creature that can really tank damage. A lot of people test their DPS builds using her so I can’t really get mad about it, especially if they don’t have a private server of their own. There’s also the issue of a bunch of idiots showing up and sitting on top of fences/tents so she won’t land, constantly staggering her in the air and ruining her animations; thus dragging a 3 minute fight into 20 minutes. I’ve also been that squish build player who’s failed the queen event while desperately waiting for support from high-level players scattered across the map. I’m not saying they were right, But I understand.
---
Irrelevant. The game’s RNG for drops is simple RNG. There have been multiple people that have tested this. Nothing affected what drops for you in the wild or from Murmrgh. The only factor is certain weapons won’t drop from Murmrgh unless you know the plan already, like The Fixer.
---
Oh god the horror
---
XB1 here. How about when you’re leaving your benches? Almost always my character turns right back to it again to scrap/ build whatever. Sometimes twice.
---
I can. Was in the event with 2 others and I got it to level 2 but I had to deal with a couple of gulpers and couldn’t get back to turn stuff in
---
That’s witch hunting and not allowed in this sub. It can quickly get you banned.
---
Is riding shotgun like a rare event? I’ve literally only seen it pop up once. I’m level 98 and have played quite a bit.
---
It’s too complex an event for randoms to wrap their heads around. You actually need a team of decent players to accomplish it.
---
I'm just glad you dont have to go outside to fast travel anymore. Working your way out of a dungeon, than loading screen to outside, than fast travel seems like a nightmare compared to what we have now. I'm personally okay with the loading screen to go into the building.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong but doesn't Emergency Protocols reduce damage by 50%?
---
Also if you plan to do a lot of SBQ fights I'd highly recommend equipping Protocols. It makes you significantly more tankier because of how percentages stack as compared to the diminishing returns of DR/ER.
---
If you plan to mainly do a lot of general mobbing and exploring then a Jetpack will suit you fine. PA's natural 42% damage reduction is more than enough for everyday use and the Jetpack can enhance your exploration.
---
I practically had to suck dick to get a fixer plan today.
---
Ahh clevercolt72517 I'll be running it when it pops up. Right now I'm just doing treasure maps
---
I don’t disagree, but I want small things that improve the QOL.
---
What happens then? Lol
---
This is very useful. I’ve been debating changing from bloodied and now I just might give it a shot, that is once I get a decent junkies weapon.
---
&gt;  It's okay to make something a bit more realistic.
---
I couldn't agree more, but the croc already is a cartoon mascot. Some more realistic looking masks of other monsters would be fantastic though. Remember the ghoul mask from FO3? More stuff like that would be sweet.
---
Does it have to be a two star, one from each effect level? Or just any one effect out of all listed
---
Which event
---
They are just really rare
---
Tyrolean hat, it's in the files but not released. There's actually a mod on pc that replaces the beret with it.
---
Considering i've finished the quests now, i'm wondering what i'm meant to do to get XP. Just grind events? YAWN.
---
I’ve actually had better luck with addictions to take a type exit my pipboy then go in take a different type of drug, rinse and repeat. I’ve never had any luck with taking multiple drugs in succession. And I’ve made a lot of junkies.
---
Thanks!
---
This bug is really irritating because it puts other players at such an advantage in the bullion grind. 300 bullion is roughly three days of grinding the three quests for me (settlers, raiders and davenport). I don't have a lot of time to grind events so if I'm able to find an hour to play I get through those quests. I last bought from Smiley on 6/14 and he rejected me yesterday, nearly two weeks later. I didn't visit Wayward in between because we were out of town so that wasn't a reason. FIX THIS
---
Deathclaws are a lifelong commitment, you can’t just have them put to sleep because they’re no longer little and cute.
---
Shame on you, OP.
---
What else would you like to get xp?
---
Honestly, you should never be allowed to get that powerful in the game.
---
There's always the risk of this happening. It can even happen if you've got your camp somewhere remote where you would assume nobody would ever nuke.
---
The only way to 100% prevent it is to put your camp somewhere in the un-nukable zone in the forest area. (This is probably why I see so many camps set up in that region)
---
It's pretty rare but I've seen a few about. I think something like the tattered field jacket is probably the rarest. I've got all but the last 2 also. It's funny that the blue is considered one of the easier to get, I got all the rest while trying to get one lol.
---
Good idea, I’m hoping the upcoming public teams update will help with this. Maybe create a team looking to tackle specific events or just event focused
---
Keep trying buddy. Are you apart of any discord groups? You could try see if people are selling any or put in a buy offer.
---
All praise be to the frog 🐸
---
Desensitization! It isn't that we will launch a nuke ourselves it's just that we will be ho-hum about the thought of it. Same thing with violence in video games and movies; people react differently when steaped in that type of culture. 
---
So "they" say.
---
I have a question, what does reporting someone with a trap base do? Can someone actually get in trouble for using in-game, purposefully agro items? Just wondering because if I report it and nothing happens, I would be wasting my own time, right?
---
Sure thing, happy to help.
---
Nice i like it, ive seen a few CAMPS built on that building, must be easy to glitch it up there?
---
...Beckett on the other hand.
---
“Let me know if I’m in your way.”
---
YOU’RE ALWAYS IN MY WAY, BECKETT! ALWAYS! WTF is with your obsession with my tinker station, literally the only workbench I regularly need to access, and the one you’re always hogging!? 
---
Someone come murder my Beckett for me.
---
Ah thanks king
---
Good to know. Did you have a question?
---
you can't trade secret service armor in a legitimate way.
---
I just encountered this about a week ago for the first time, was super confused. Interesting little encounter though.
---
I'd really like to see old missions/quests remixed to give us something 'new' to do. I know it takes a lot of time for the developers, but just doing events isn't very engaging.
---
Secret service armor is bound to the character that made it
---
That’s raider shielded and it is a very rare plan.  Have to get it from savage divide events.
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Harness\_(Fallout\_76)](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Harness_(Fallout_76))
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
you need to find the first 2 at a raider bot and then the next 2 can be drops from certain events. You could ask someone to do it for you but they'd probably charge. If i had the plans i'd do it for you.
---
How many different places are there to check? I check all the beds, dressers, shelves, and I know there's one hidden behind a piece of rubble or something.
---
i think some bosses need to be invincible to but still be able to tag them for the first like 30 seconds they are around lol this would help with the " no one but me gets loot! " ppl
---
The merchant and your companion *diapered* themselves?
---
I am obsessed with the mire so had best get used to them.
---
Ok mr. Loremaster.Dont think the raiders patented their armor.The point is everything can be tweaked so it becomes "lore friendly".The riot armor is a good example...
---
There's only 3 exact spots it appears apparently. Room across from the lift on the bed you can see from the lift. In the showers and in the room opposite the showers.
---
This is a problem with crippling perks not working on her anymore.  It used to be that you could force her to land with crippling perks but now you can't. Bethesda said this was not intended but they haven't fixed it.
---
Well? Until there’s something else to do? Keep trying. Speaking from experience. It took me almost a month to finally roll/get an unyielding secret service chest piece. It was kinda worth the wait. Unyielding powered Cavalier. Took me even longer to roll/get a bloodied ffr gauss minigun. Don’t give up man.
---
Unfortunately it's all bad luck. I'm a full health build and I've rolled the perfect unyielding with reduced fall damage my bloodied build friend so desperately wants so he can get a jet pack and stop dying from fall damage where as he has been rolling the vanguard pieces I really want.
---
It only starts when someone triggers it. You have to go to the big bend tunnel east entrance and talk to vinnie.
---
Honestly, I don't go to camps anymore. 90% of camps I go to have nothing I want or need and I just wasted money getting there. I'd welcome a one stop shopping area much like the lower floors of the White springs and all its vendors.
---
all they have to do is make everything legacy and everything hacked untradeable..
---
people who invested heavily in them will riot a bit.. then it will be over...
---
also many many bans.. they do not perma ban nearly enough in this game
---
/unpopular opinion
---
I don’t think the issue is using a trap base. The issue here is using the punji board exploit and luring players in using the looking for group feature of the Xbox. Bethesda and Microsoft were both responsive when I reported the behavior. Microsoft more so than Bethesda. I think Microsoft issues leveled communications bans before account banning for this type of stuff.
---
Thanks odd it’s in the game but not in the game. Thanks again
---
Caps would immediately have value again if presents were either removed, or the better option of no caps given for opening them. Sure there would be lots of people with max caps, but the cap pool would drop from infinite amount to enough to stabilize the economy.
---
I didn't either until I found him there. It was a bit of a surprise, he was standing at the entrance in both places.
---
Hacked items should definitely receive the banhammer but I’m referring to the economy as a whole, not select items within the trading pool. High DPS weapons will always be worth more than others, but if your currency is something that can be traded in plans for a weapon that’s almost as good? That legacy’s value drops significantly.
---
It’s rough dude. Been trying for 2-3 weeks as well. I did get two star legs but that’s been it. How many have you been trying a day?
---
I've ran both and settled on junkies. Easier qol and more forgiving to my mistakes.  Not to mention it kills everything easily.
---
It's hard to get. Go to the trading subreddit and buy it. Should be about 2K
---
In related news, bloodied 25 25 fixers aren’t dropping from every other ghoul at white springs. What gives....🤔
---
Is it a good time to reinstall and get back into FO76? I stopped playing after getting somewhere over Lv50, maybe a month or so after launch. Never bothered trading in the disc lol. 
---
I quit due to: Dupers ruining trader style play, and cheapening the grind for legendary weapons; high level griefers, incl those being OP af in nuke zones; not finding that many players (PS4); and the odd bug or two.
---
Maybe, but we have the issue of an inherently valueless currency. The only value caps have for me at this point is purchasing gold bullion once a week. I can’t eat them, I can’t shoot things with them. It’s why 556 took off as a trade item because of it’s intrinsic value.
---
Lol
---
I did the thing where you stand on top of the vault entrance in power armor, then leap down for the dramatic "superhero landing" in front of the new player, and then drop them some tricked out leather armor and some aid items.
---
Of course my game started lagging and before I could do the dramatic landing, the newbie had already run off down to the 2 scavengers, so I had to run down and throw the stuff on the ground and point to it.
---
 Can’t remember just remember getting it and being really happy then well that happening
---
Praise thy froggo
---
It's a quest reward for Wolf In Sheep's Clothing. 
---
Also if you have the plan the Moleman Vendor starts dropping legendaries of it.
---
Don’t worry I’ve stacked stash boxes and ended up making a whole house on a workshop out of them it was actually quite entertaining.
---
You need 3 animals alive to get the best rewards and 2 to get anything decent, and that almost never happens in a public server. If you can even get any other people, they will all follow you into whichever biome you go to and compete for kills instead of doing the objective. It's essentially a waste of time because you will never have the chance to get any of the rewards you'd do the event for
---
I once had a server where 8 people came. It was like a miracle. Then I saw that 6 of them went to the radstag biome, one followed me to the radkelp, and the mole rats were left unattended. Needless to say, we ended up with one animal (barely) surviving. Probably my biggest disappointment in the game for 800 hours, right up there with finding out that "big pew" is not a unique energy weapon
---
Same here. All I ever get thrown at me are endless pieces of unyielding and bolstering armor. And I run around at full health at all times.
---
It almost seems like the game actually checks how much health you have and deliberately gives you the opposite of what you need, for some reason.
---
It encourages trading with a system that disables the ability to trade
---
Wouldn't people just log in and start earning capital by actually doing nothing rather than just selling stuff for caps?
---
I think what Bethesda needs to do is find a way to HEAVILY sink caps. I don't know of any duping methods these days, but even without duping it's pretty easy to get your dailies. So it's not about blancing income. Maybe make some premium events that they actually put time and effort into. Make certain items only available through trade at shops, which they can then control the price of and fight inflation that way. Give helicopter tours of Appalachia for 15k caps only once a week. There are ways to combat the massive inflation, but Bethesda doesn't seem to be interested in making the ingame currency viable.
---
Ahh thanks for the info.
---
I started a new character during the 3xp event and got mine from one of Rose’s main story quests without buying the others...I had done those quests a lot and usually got outfits...
---
I honestly stopped nuking for the queen fight because of this reason. It’s super annoying as hell to me after 3 times already.  I used to nuke in public servers to share the loot of Scorched earth. But these a holes just ruined the fun!!!
---
Hope the well tuned wanderer finds a new good home to play his comforting music in whilst lonely survivors stock up on supplies. 🍻 to a new adventure.
---
lol I remember a few months ago when bear arm plans were auctioned for 30k+ caps. Wonder how bad it is now
---
Most of your issues have been fixed (PC). Currently though there are “Magic” guns that kill the queen in a matter of seconds, kind of kills the whole event for people since they can’t get their 1k dog in for rewards.
---
Who needs frog when we have a cute mothman backpack. Hail Mothman
---
Not excited at all, because according to data miners there's a daily cap.
---
Thats a great view, whats the location?
---
When did you finish it?  I swear I ran across one that looked exactly like yours.  Either way it looks fantastic!!
---
Did that with a full set of power armour. Terrible.
---
Thanks! It feels weird to prep for such a move after so long, and I do very much love my Mono-Mart, but this is a massive map and I’m excited to experiment with some new locations!
---
I just want to be able to carry more while wearing my power armor than while wearing normal armor. Unyielding armor just makes PA even worse in that regard. I can carry vastly more while at death's door than I can while wearing a giant metal suit. It's just stupid. Sure the excavator set has an extra 100 pounds but it's also the weakest by far.
---
They're killing the game with all these Fucking caps and holdbacks.
---
It's already pushed away so many people.
---
The 5.56 was a fantastic currency, until it got duped too. If the caps got reverted by the lose of caps in presents then we got more cap sinks, it would be fixed. 
---
The bullion, gift wrap, and pails did so well.
---
I will add you as soon as i can:)
---
Nice idea, I wonder how many new people have found the cache and thought they'd hit the jackpot?
---
I saved up for the big reward, thinking it would be a legendary item. It was just ore and maybe chems. I honestly can't remember what it all was because it was all useless.
---
Okay then, put Institute Synth armor in the game but just rename it so it’s lore-friendly. Enclave could come up with it, right? The logic falls flat, they should make new armors and not reuse the ones that make other games’ worldspace feel unique.
---
...did you check your stash? I can pretty much guarantee you just encountered the exact same bug as 100 other people who have posted about it in this sub: your vendors and displays basically reset and everything is in your stash.
---
That is a good idea if it were implemented as a pip boy channel that could be enabled or disabled.  Allow us to select it if we wish to hear server wide chat.  Not sure how hard that would be to implement though.
---
Lmao at the rural king in my home town there’s totally a baby hanging station, someone crossed out the c on the changing station, I took a pic of it but sadly I lost that phone
---
Had a clean version but it got scraped by accident. Have to hunt it again
---
Can you re-word your first point it doesn’t make sense?
---
I certainly would pay an arm and a leg in legendaries for the chance to not have to spend time grinding this game every single day. I’ve lost all motivation to continue playing on my second character, whereas on my main account I’m sitting on 800 treasury notes with nothing I want to spend them on because it’s not worth changing my build. 
---
Bethesda did somewhat do that by making bullion purchasable with caps, but 6,000 is a drop of water compared to how much is sitting out there. It’s a valueless currency. It’s not getting used up with other means like how treasury notes get turned in every day or junk gets used or ammo gets shot.
---
Kind of ignorant here.  What does it do? It’s just collectible or rare? For display?  Or it’s worth a pile of caps?
---
I can’t explain why Trapper armor or Marine armor is in the game. That’s the point, doesn’t make any sense and that’s not a reason to add more things that don’t make sense. Renaming it or changing the color or something doesn’t make it not the armor it is.
---
Are you sure it's 7.5%? Every other guide puts it at 10%, max of 50%. 
---
Here's a popular one that gets linked often: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/fz7x5c/yabs_junkie_guide_or_how_i_learned_to_stop
---
Someone datamined the game and it looks like there's a cap per day .
---
You should know the communist collectron station has the same functions as the standard one, in addition to being able to find aid and weapons.
---
This happened to me today.  I was in the middle of Project Paradise and did not want to abandon it so close to the end so I had to let it just go boom.
---
I put it there so that players who were grinding whitesprings would have crates/stash boxes/work benches/free water nearby.  To those of you who think it is funny to destroy someone's base when you could easily tick the nuke over a smidge and miss it, that is why you can't  have nice things.
---
It is BS.  I had enough of it so I moved my camp this afternoon.
---
More just joking it's super rare to get one out of a porta-diner. But you can find one on west-tek's roof so they aren't rare themselves.
---
Thank you! I think it's the same price too.
---
Yes I believe so, and you can only place one collectron station at a time. I wish I knew before.
---
Sweet. Well that's what I'm grabbing.
---
Yeah I was looking at serious trades to get one and then boom every rare plan for free.
---
Hmmm perhaps.
---
Friends. First allows you to transfer items on a private server from one to another for stash limitations, but caps you have to do p2p. Is, you are max cap on your alt and you wanna move 15k. You find a friend with enough room to God the caps for you, you buy a bullet from them (or something else like that) for 15k. You hop on your alt and the. Sell something I significant to them for 15k. I usually do it for 1k less than I had them hold for helping but up to u.  When u come out of the vault have your friend be at the rusty pick so I can fast travel to them there. Leave your alt there for the script machine and stash box inside.
---
Well! My character's name is Fergus Langdon, he's getting on his years, pushing into his late forties. But Gus' whole background is a crazy one. Before the bombs fell, Gus was apart of the rioters occupying Mount Blair and Beckley - Once things went crazy, he and some other miners and their families ducked into the mountain to wait out the storm. When it never ended, a lot because Mole Miners - Gus is one of the few that didn't, opting to go topside rather than mingle with the unstable, often animalistic mole miners.   
---
As a consequence to actually living with them and possibly knowing some of them, I do my best when playing to avoid killing Mole Miners. (The Treasure Hunter event was a nightmare of conscience. xD)   
---
Gus more or less runs around with a revolver and a pickaxe patrolling the Ash Heap and venturing outside of it every now and again to do trade with the settlers. More often than not he's hunting raiders and blood-eagles and trying to 'clean up' the Ash heap in preparation for more miners to come up and join him.  
---
My long-term goal is to establish a faction with him if that ever becomes a supported option in the game, some sort of common interest, anti-authoritarian group of miners that've emerged from Mount Blair.
---
I had this happen recently swapping between ultracite Gatling laser and rifle - it seems to work fine all the time with any weapons until I tried to do it with my ugl ...

I'm glad I won't have to dump my reward Mini nukes and missiles anymore. Always sold my Grenade Launcher ammo successfully for 1 cap each but the nukes and missiles just sat there, better just tossing it until now!

that’s bethesda for you
---
No thanks.
---
Suitcase stairs are hilarious and awesome.
---
I will have to try that out
---
We are talking about the raiders here.There are already too many reused assets from previous games so at this point alot of it doesnt make sense...
---
Does this come with update 20? If it does around when will the update drop? I haven't been keeping up lately, I wanna get right back to the game when it's all here.
---
I ran bloodied for a week and love Junkies so much more. No deaths, great damage.
---
But I'm a heavy gunner PA so I never got the full unyielding / serendipity version of bloodied, which is where it probably shines most. But if you're a PA user, I'd say it's worth a shot. Doesn't require any perks really which is nice. My 2c!
---
It’s all off that amazon server thing as I recall, hence the issues a few weeks back.
---
To be fair, I still entirely agree with giving us the Nuka World raider armors. They're just scrap metal, belts and cloth. Nothing we couldn't make ourselves in appalachia. I think it's entirely lore friendly for them to give them to us with a different name.
---
Hey great write up. Very similar to what I run but I use a junkies 40% power attack +1 Str MMG instead. 
---
What Armor stats are you running?
---
HERETIC ALL BELEVERS AtACK
---
When I hit that point, I slowly bought every plan, serum and recipe in the game from every vendor.  Then as odd ones showed up in their inventory later, I bought those too.  Any time I find ammo that I use priced at 1 cap, I buy that too.  Meds that are less easily found in game like psychotats.  I buy them up.  Fluxes are also a good cap sink when you can find them.  I have characters with full weight reduction armor sets that I slowly assembled set up as mules, so storage space isn't a great concern.
---
Now I go buy any weapon that I like regardless of price when my caps get too high.  I also built a set of good troubleshooter's armor and bought rare outfits.
---
I was pretty excited when I first saw this. Finally for me and the boys from Pyongyang to relax with a few beers. But then... I saw that American flag. Yeah, not my kind of Red Rocket Cafe
---
Institute armor is designed with specificity in mind, it's iconic. The disciples and operators literally just have pieces of rusty metal strapped to their chests with belts, bullets and spikes. They're extremely generic post apocalyptic designs that anyone can make at any point in the timeline. They're not designed, they're cobbled together.
---
Try balloons too it’s interesting as well
---
I must call my brøthers, we will fight for what we believe. WE SHALL NOT BE SILENCED. HAIL MOTHMAN!
---
So rip more assets from 4?
---
Yeah I forgot smiley.  That is a pretty large sink for a while.  But I am at max gold now so he isn't interested in selling me any.
---
Then why are you asking for more?
---
Just happened to me for the second time a few moments ago.
---
What I think causes it is someone being in your vendor shopping when you log off a server.  I usually check my base for shoppers, but a friend swapped servers and a nuke had just launched, and I joined up on him.  Right as I did this a person purchased an item from me.
---
NØ FRÖG MÜŠT HAVE SACRIFICES MOTHS SHÄLL BE BURNED

Thanks so much, I havnt done the math myself, but I too was struggling to figure out which of the two it was. Looks like 10% per weapon max 50% is the real value.

It is possible on PC to run 2 instances of the game at once and transfer directly from one toon to the other by yourself if you have a second account.

Yes, they're already done. The assets look fine. If it bothers you don't use them, but I'd personally love some more generic scrap armor that can reasonably fit in with the world.
---
Nah, game barely handles what's already present and sometimes doesn't even do that.
---
Having all of them is actually pretty helpful. The maxed Class Freak perk negates most of the negative aspects and overall it doesn't seem to affect me too much, just slightly less carry weight. I went from being able to carry 265 down to 248. All the other SPECIAL stats either went up drastically or stayed the same. I definitely get just using the serums if you can afford them though. I don't currently have a specific build, so I'm not too worried about how it affects me.
---
Where is that located? Do you have a build guide video? That’s awesome and I’d like to try it. Do I just start it off by doing what the above person said then edit it from there? I like the stacks from your stove rather than using an instrument.
---
I would LOVE an Operators suit. And what about those Nuka World Handmade skins? Some option other than plain or matte black, please.
---
also just thought of this during a sdq fight a minute ago.
---
i'm sure there would be a few ppl that would think " ok i that's enough i can get loot now, ill stand here afk until they kill her " 
---
as i was watching someone who was shooting her at the start just stand there as if he knew he had done enough to get loot and wasn't wasting anymore ammo
---
Balloons? haha
---
Unfortunately, I don't have the plans, you should make a video!
---
my companion was shooting at the merchant so i went in to edit camp and stored her, as soon as i did she and the merchant went away instantly and the turrets stopped
---
Might help if you had my handle: Blacktyde83
---
Yeah, I got excited the other day when I finally got my last piece of unyielding SS armor, a three star left leg. My excitement quickly diminished when I realized the stars were +1 charisma and the sweet spot when picking locks is bigger. I just had to shake my head, but it’ll work for now until I can get a better one.
---
No problem, I didn't do any of the work haha. Good work putting this all together, Junkies is such a quick and easy build to run once you understand it with guides like yours.
---
after enough times of randoms blowing it, people no longer trust randoms
---
knowing this game it would take as looooong for the empty tag to show up lol
---
Coming back up the chain to thank you, because I managed to get my third piece of SB just now, right before the other two expired, and Ingot them ALL by rerolling the Civic Centre nests. Which I would not have know. To do without your post (and OP’s help finding the nests). I am finally free of this quest - the relief was palpable!
---
If you are buying 2 @$300 caps each
---
“Don’t like it, don’t use it.” Doesn’t make the armor/weapon not exist. It’s a lore reason. I want more scrap armor too but also that looks feasible for the point in the timeline we’re at in 76 not armor that won’t be made for another ~200 years.
---
Nerf Bloddied Builds
---
Finally, i can convert all those missiles and .38 rounds i cant sell
---
I hear you. I’m just trying to get a full set at this point.
---
and I did.
---
But if she isnt shot at all, she'll fly back to the nuke zone. I've experienced both scenarios
---
Non PC player here, sounds like that may work though too
---
Are you Power armor? Bc I feel like it has to do with skins and the game thinking its T60 or T51 but in reality it's Ultracite. I'm getting a crap ton of more rads
---
Making a third reply just to say THANK YOU. After killing something like 12 SB’s and getting nothing last night, I got 2 pieces from the Civic Center nests on rerolls, and the third piece tonight when the nests respawned with minutes left on the first two before they spoiled. Couldn’t have done this without your help.
---
So it was you.  Noted.
---
Not a fan of the tin cans, i wear marine and trapper supplemented by radshield
---
Yay, glad to be of help!
---
Every time I get in a server no one has a mic. I play on Xbox and would think people would have a mic but I guess not.
---
This reminds me of the time where i was level 15 and made a level 1 an upgraded pipe pistol and a bunch of amunitions. Pretty sure i made him a bow too. My camp was next to vault 76 at the time.
---
Trocest?!
---
You sure it isn't poison?  That is literally the only thing that kills me.  Rads never do and I run 19% hp all the time.  I ended up getting two pieces of poison resistant armor and it helped tremendously.
---
I’ve been noticing having to use a lot more radaway. I was going for a long time between before even in nuke zones but now it’s something I actually have to keep
---
It also doesn’t matter if it’s developed. People treat Bethesda updating this game like it’s their hobby and they’re some indie company.
---
It does look feasible to the timeline though. xD   
---
That's your problem, it's metal and cloth - Change the cloth texture to brown, change the metal to be a little darker. Bam, it's just generic scrap armor with no specific design or thought put into it.   
---
The operators and disciples don't have super distinctive designs that nobody would've reasonable just made on their own. It's literally just pieces of metal and belts. Seriously, it's less designed than the vanilla metal armor which nobody has an issue with. xD
---
Jurastic park in fallout
---
Did you find a way to get it to work?
---
Pretty much, its still got its issues, but what online game doesnt have issues?
---
No doubt that power armor could use a universal STR/carry weight boost. For the sake of staying on topic, though, that isn't what I had in mind.
---
It happened once and i haven’t been playing lately on that character to try it again ... so not sure if it is still happening...
---
It matters because they're already done. There's no investment to be made. It's just drag and drop. That does matter, that means it's worth adding because there is no net loss only a net benefit.
---
Poison isnt a problem, i run 650DR 680ER 589RR and 50PR. Im just not understanding why i get pumped with rads like im wearing a box of vegetable starch.
---
Rad resistance and rad damage are 2 different things in a sense, still tied to overall rad resistance in the end, Full SS gives me enough that a CAMP rad barrel that is supposed to give 15/sec gives me 6/sec. So rad resistance is in effect. Ghouls do more ballistic damage to me than rad damage since I am always balancing in the 20% health range.
---
I'll buy weightless armors, even when they're not the best rolls.. with a lighter or ultralight mod, most end up weighing zero without any perk investment.
---
It's a way to sink caps and bank scrip I guess.
---
LOL man IDK.
---
If you don't find the npc corpse on accident at a place like giant teapot, lighthouse, whitespring, watoga, or Beckley it will be on a personal terminal listed as suspicious commie activity and you can find it from there
---
Plz dont my house is there :(
---
Yes. I just need to get rid of all of this crap that I have for my shotgun shells which I go through so fast.
---
You can only get so much ore on your own, you need minimum 3 people in the event. Most you can get in a quick run without going back to check is 40 ores. Meaning 3 people can get a total of 120 ores. If they take turns defending and running they should be able to do it easily and deposit it all together at once. Just cripple legs and you're set. Its not hard, its just people are selfish and stupid.
---
Ok before 2 weeks ago if a charred feral hit me it would say around +12 rads/sec. Now in the same set, same resistances it says +45rads/sec no matter what. Its in effect yes, but incoming rads are broken despite the resistances. Simply put, the math doesnt add up.

---
haha! i will not nuke your camp. i’m not an a$$hole
---
Are you actually gaining those 45/sec because the numbers really are inconsistent in game
---
Thanks! Yeah in a perfect world I would have the +40% power attack for sure. 
---
I run a mix of different legendary armor effects since again, I am not nailed down to an unyielding type of play style. So I run things like stim armor, vanguards, auto stim, cameleon. And every piece of armor has +1 strength and action point refresh if I can get it. 
---
In PA I have 452 DR and 435 ER and 423 RR (PA also gives you some % damage cut the game wont tell you about) \*You Tuber Angry Turtle
---
Out of PA I have 367 DR 291 ER and 115 RR
---
Blocker really makes life a breeze to. One of the most underrated perks in game for sure.
---
Same I’ve only had to repair one right leg of my power armor and I’ve worn mine since I got it like 2 weeks ago
---
Snack and/or bathroom break. Easiest  3 treasury notes in the game.
---
I run a bloody build but I have lot of defensive perks such as blocker, adamantium skeleton, serendipity, nerd rage, lifegiver etc. I ran scorched-earth about seven times today and I think I died 3 times. At least one of them was because I spawned in the nuke zone. So I think maybe your problem is in your perk setup.
---
It’s so hard to took way too long 😂
---
I want the raider tree more than anything, to be honest.
---
So does guided meditation. Let the ghouls attack the bridge and don’t kill them. They’ll get stuck in each other’s hit boxes and not damage the speakers... other ghouls do not spawn unless someone kills them or distracts them which is very often
---
Yes, before i hardly ever had to use radaway. Now it seems like im popping it every 5 minutes.
---
Every time I try to help out a "freshie" he/she runs away and won't come near the bag I try and place at their feet. 
---
I won't go near someone unless they are level 15 or higher.
---
can you sell repair kits? if so, i’m gonna sell them
---
So do u know how to fix a issue where my mic won't work in world chat even in a group it won't come thru and I can't hear anyone talking at all unless I bring them to a party lol
---
Today was the first time I’ve ever seen the entire server come together for tea time. Usually I’m doing that event with one other person or alone.
---
Thats why I made it brother.
---
Thanks! The main structure was done a couple nights ago, but I've been working on finishing touches since then.
---
No, it just says that on an old chart
---
PM my friend jackomara, he is a master builder and can give you some tips. Tell him I sent you.
---
My camp is just south of the snake image on the map south of whitespring.  Whitespring has been nuked a few times while I was playing, and so far I've been just outside the blast zone.
---
Junkies requires so little, you can honestly test it out while you are speced for bloodied.
---
Im the tank for our group so i let all the enemies come to me and beat me up. Used to be a crowd of ferals swarming up on me wasnt an issue, now its rad city and im the fucking mayor.
---
There’s no air in there anymore IIRC
---
Ah yes. Sorry. It was 50 percent, all the more debatable now. Yeah, if only I knew earlier about the jetpacks being able to be modded to arms of power armor. Anyway, thank you for your input.
---
I believe he's mistaken. Each collectron has their own unique modes that are unlocked once you buy them. You would need a regular and communist collectron to collect scrap with the communist skin.
---
Yes, please.
---
I understand that for areas with mobs guarding them, say RobCo, this could be excluded but for places like The Wayward, Overseer’s Home, etc this would be a huge QOL improvement.
---
For example Foundation and Foundation (interior) could be shown as options when fast traveling.
---
The amount of time spent in load screens is my personal pet peeve of a game I otherwise really enjoy.
---
Good to know. Those little secrets and loop holes are what I wanted to exploit here.
---
I like to tell the Raider deserter to go to Foundation. They get a new start on life and I get a little tiny bit of Settlers rep!
---
No you can’t. Can’t drop them either
---
Okay thank you!
---
It's probably the most scenic location in the game. I had my camp there forever and tried to make it blend in, but I found it too tedious to keep. I couldn't keep a pet alive there, couldn't avoid getting my camp damaged by ghouls, constantly had people using my camp location, and of course had to server hop anytime someone dropped a nuke. Having a turret or two only seemed to draw the golf club ghouls over. Having a shop brought people in but also spawned enemies, meaning no matter what I did I was always coming back to my camp in trouble, and things regularly being level 68 or so meant it was taxing on my resources.
---
I highly doubt you can create a team by yourself that defeats the purpose of a team
---
Clearly I have never run across your camp, that’s all I use.  Lol. I go through 4-6K per session, another 2-3k if I do SBQ events.  I hate making ammo, I hope I can still find people selling it after the converters come out
---
I bet. Lol
---
Just wanted to add to this - fireproof is also extremely good vs SBQ
---
That’d be dope, closest thing to the Jones mask from HM I can get
---
Lmao there is so many kids on 76 hard to tell unless there on mic but hell yeah the peeps I play with range from 28 to 56
---
Best analogy yet! This is now stolen.
---
Eh. It doesn't turn out ultracite ammo so w/e
---
Or maybe have an extra option when fast traveling. When you click the location, it asks if you want to pay X caps or cancel. It would be 3 options: X caps, X caps inside, cancel. Just a thought bc sometimes you don’t want to spawn inside the building, sometimes it’s just to get close to a place that you want to explore.
---
This will crash the ammo market I feel.  No one will buy from players if they can just convert.  I'm all for this patch and excited even I just think my melee build will have to stop picking up ammo
---
Although it is far less frequent now, as opposed to how often it was nuke farmed closer to game launch, the White Springs is probably the second most commonly nuked area of the map.
---
If you have a camp there it will get nuked at some point, which stinks.
---
There are so many amazing places to build your camp you should have no problem finding an amazing alternative.
---
Any of the usual good damage prefixes and / or a particularly fast bow. 
---
I just like them so I’ll give them a good home.
---
Best method for this?
---
they cost 0
---
Hats off to you good sir (or madam)!  Outstanding!  Really love your use of the bar/counter pieces as framing material.  
---
Constantly impressed by the creativity of the community.  Thank you for sharing.
---
I have a two-shot, armour-piercing 250 damage resist while reloading gat plasma and ultracite gatling laser. I literally hate them both, more-so the gatling plasma, the recoil and aim in non-first person is just conniptions and brain hemmorhage material it's the sort of shit that makes you grit your teeth so hard they crack.
---
However, MG42 with limb damage on literally fucking anything is fucking arosing and pleasurable, it's like that Jin-Roh movie where the Nippons never stopped their imperialism obsession, so they had non-powered armoured, heavy-armoured police roaming the streets with MG42s and fucking flamers, that power fantasy? That can be yours, for the small price of a limb damage MG42 in the videogame Fallout 76, as usual and as always, due to bugs, you can be the fucking terminator.
---
On that note, limb damage nuking is based on fire rate, so IIRC it's only worthwhile on the MG42, I'm biased but yeah for real, that shit is fucking stupid and murders everything, if you point 3 or 4 of those at Score-Queen she's going down in 30 seconds.
---
I'd love a mounted ballista/harpoon launcher that you can shoot at the SBQ that you can reel her in with.
---
Were private world available on PTS?
---
Yes there is one for both Melee and ranged it’s also the perk that lets you build better weapons
---
makes sense. thanks
---
What's it called ?
---
Gunsmith makes guns break up to 50% slower with 5 levels in intelligence
---
Yes it will come this Tuesday with patch 20 . Bethesda also posted all the rewards you can get with the first season
---
[Actually stumbled on this picture while I was looking for something else.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19ZbT32GyMn15CjiSe3iDNrrWyfPVz6b2/view?usp=sharing)
---
I accidentally killed a legendary mole miner in Uranium Fever last night before anybody else could get some shots in. I felt really bad, cause I do that event to get good items and I get really mad when people do the same thing and I can't get any legendary items 😕 I didn't travel across half the map just to end up with nothing haha.
---
Nice!
---
That's true. I might just get jetpack for t65. I use excavator with emergency protocols and calibrated shocks for my daily adventures. Thank you for your input.
---
Weapon artisan to repair them above maximum.
---
Gunsmith to slow the speed they lose durability (also required for crafting guns)
---
Hang around the encrypted event, lots of people die.
---
260 is fine, heavy weapons tend to do the most damage to the queen, rifleman/commando's are good for picking off the waves of enemies before they get too close, as long as your getting in enough damage to get loot i wouldn't be concerned too much, bigger numbers will come on their own.
---
As much as people complain that the only end-game is grinding, it's the cheaters' fault that nothing is worth grinding for
---
Gunsmith for guns, Makeshift Warrior for melee, both in Intelligence.
---
They're needed for a lot of crafting and mods so dual use!
---
Thanks. When I log on next Im going to hang around Foundation for a bit and see if he will spawn.
---
Gunsmith for ranged
---
Were they in front of the stash box in the overseers camp? That's where I leave a lot of plans I don't think will sell. Also a side note, when I was a lower level I had really good luck finding plans at whitesprings station in either the blue suitcase or the cloth sack on the left side of the door next to the tinkers workbench so check there ever so often as well!
---
South of Whitesprings, a little northeast of Bastion Park. The cliffs overlook highway 93A. The redeeming value is the view and it’s easy to defend, being on the edge of a 50’ cliff. But no water source or much farmable land there.
---
I love mine too but I’ve switched to bloodied ultracite Gatling - fusion cores are easier to get
---
I have a vffr gp and a vffr gl.I prefer the gatling laser because power user doubles your ammo. Either way you're pretty much unkillable.
---
Welcome to the Wastelands.
---
Most I ever got off a queen for damage was 6k but I run bloodied melee
---
I’m pretty excited by all of it.
---
I love that you can get so many Atomic Shop quality items just by playing the game.
---
Yessss
---
cryptid?
---
I like about 5-6 of them but it’s not worth all the atoms we’re losing. Not at fucking all.
---
I am the same way! I work to help low levels! To help every newbie who comes out of the vault on my server. Being what I wish I had when I was first starting out in the game
---
It would make sense for vault 76 to become our hub since were all 76ixers
---
If you go there and don't see him, just hop to the other locations. He's always in motion and doesn't stay still very long. Are you on XB? If you're just wanting the mirror ball in your camp, I can build it there for you. I put it someone else's camp last night.
---
People already hate microtransections, it wouldn't go over well probably
---
Fair enough. I guess they could make some free?
---
Its bethesda, only craps free lol
---
Yeah! I’m looking for people too. PSN: TheNotSoEpic
---
 I wish I had the name of the guy who gave me a full set of Level 25 Excavator Power Armor in front of Riverside Manor when I was literally just level 25.
---
I tried to give them some Stims, ammo, anything I had that might possibly be of value, and they refused any payment, just emoted a thumbs-up at me!
---
^(Later I tried to repay the favour by regifting the armor to a new player, but some level 100+ jerkface just jumped in and janked it.  Eff that guy.)
---
Another option is to get addicted to psycho and medx which reduces your DR by 20 and then create a level 2 mule to get 3 star leather or wood armor from the purveyor.
---
You can add or remove mods to make you DR come out to 0 pretty easily and still have all 3 star effects.  Other benefits are not having to play with broken armor and not needing ballistic weave to fix anything.
---
I was having fun building this up but RNG awarded me 2 awesome junkies weapons and I changed my build.
---
Well wait. I think I did need some fertilizer. 🤷
---
There probably wouldn't need to be a cap if people hadn't duped and filled their scrap boxes and alts with 10k+of each crafting mat
---
Love your channel btw.
---
I had one of these, but it was a laser instead of a plasma.
---
I thought, great! I'll be able to solo the Imposter with this!  
---
Haha, no.  
---
I gave it a whirl, and what ended up happening was the Sheepsquatch would run right up to me, and CONSTANTLY KEEP STAGGERING ME. And because the weapon has a spin up time, and the staggers happen quicker than the weapon can spin up, I ended up not getting any shots off and therefore not getting healed.
---
The thing was useless, and I tossed it into the nearest scrip exchange on my way home.
---
Comment
---
I'm sure there will be plenty still around
---
There's a club if you'd like to join!
---
Dont we all, but icons dont breakdown into acid sadly
---
I NEED THIS! Will add you tomorrow! 😄
---
Did you do the quest associated with him or go straight to him?
---
Ya. To bad my vomit emoji doesn't create spoiled vegetables or something.
---
This, two-shot rapid firing weapons are absolutely useless in my opinion. I had an almost exact same two-shot ultracite gatling laser myself. When I got another non two-shot one, the difference in accuracy, recoil and condition was COLLOSSAL. Two-shot is absolutely NOT worth it for barely any increase in damage (as its each shot doing 65% damage if i remember right, not double damage at all).
---
Yeah lol
---
Bloodied arent doing this. This is hacked weapons doing 2000 damage a bullet or duped buff consumables. Even a bloodied magic minigun would take about 10-20 seconds.
---
I love when camps have a thing or a feel. It's so rare to stumble across one. Hopefully the new move finds you well!
---
Don’t shoot her in the air.  You are simply wasting ammo.
---
Have damage numbers turned on so you can track your damage.
---
When she is on the ground hit her in the head until you are at (or ideally over) the 1-2k threshold.
---
It’s really that easy (or hard; if you are not well geared or built for PvE damage).
---
Did the quest. Just trying to get the dailies.
---
Doesn't that mean turrets will essentially be useless? A zone of it's own won't have monsters attacking it, right?
---
Luck primarily affects the condition of those weapons, the rest of it's a crapshoot.
---
I don't think ones existing already in the world ever worked or were intended to do so. Pretty sure they just decorations.
---
Also try Heart of the Swamp.
---
So that what was going on! I hate doing events alone and have been watching “Lode Bearing” fo weeks, since nobody ever does it. Saw that it had one participant the other day so I jumped in.  I did the whole thing by myself, only to realize that somebody was hidden outside the entrance the entire time. They at least dropped me a loot bag before leaving though.
---
Could add berries for different flavors/ boost/ effects.
---
I know for sure people duped treasury notes 🙄
---
I wish my english is better for rping, anyway ill follow your stuff and sessions. Good luck.
---
honestly its not that much of a grind to get to in the questline depending on your level. id say get it just bc it functions as a haz suit as well.
---
How did he weaponize the copyright system? Super curious as I've watched a lot of his stuff but also heard some other negative things which makes me a little hesitant to keep giving someone the watch time.
---
It's fantastic, only turrets and some of the assaultrons see you. As long as you don't get too close to other creatures, you're good!
---
I tried different silo sites. I start with alpha n went charlie. Msg was, a recent launch was detected n requires a cooldiwn period of, xx hr xx min
---
There is.  You can only have so many points.
---
When I see low levels I usually give them useful serums and tell them what to do so it doesn’t go away and I ask what they want or need and I give it to them, on occasion I will make a fixer for them :)
---
I literally said you can add different flavors
---
Yeah I screwed up and ran through the raider story without reading into rewards you get by playing both sides first, and I've barely touched settler rep
---
Is this the rare recipe from Meat Week? I think I still have one in my stash
---
* in middle of radstorm*   “Better tune my banjo!”
---
I can help you Kurtis, about to log in.
---
The one behind The Wayward not working is really dumb. When I was brand new purified water was something I had trouble getting enough of.
---
Sorry, I don't know how I missed that.
---
Sure
---
Here it is in action with The Fixer, Sneak 3 and escape artist.  Absolutely worth getting. 
---
https://youtu.be/kGRQ3CUwrvY
---
I’m running full unyielding, so a radstorm is pretty much a tanning bed for me!
---
Yes sorry, it's been a long day.
---
oh damn. that complicates things for sure. that rep grind is a bitch. in your case, id probably not want to do it.
---
It’s ok
---
*Gets banned for possession of duped ammo.
---
Jet Pack + Marsupial + Bird Bones
---
I support this
---
There's no opinions, bffr fixer is the answer :)
---
Oh I have that plan. But thank you (Im on PS4 anyway)
---
Lot of Cobalt at Jack's pumpkin house also.
---
Fortunately it’s not that bad of a rep grind for the Stealth Suit, you only have to get to Neighborly to be able to buy it. Unfortunately it’s like 4000 gold bullion, but definitely a useful item for any stealth build.
---
i use it some time now with sneak 3 and its just pure fun, seems like nobody spots me. it became a hobby to go to westtek and bounce against the super mutants and hounds to see them doing absolutly nothing :)
---
I like my B3325 Handmade rifle, easily my best weapon in 1600 hours.
---
you o oh read the title but I’m think they intended whitsprongs to be just that but it didn’t work out like they thought. Or it did and they just didn’t intend for it to be more than it is. Either way I totally agree, although I would prefer a new fresh location to visit as the new hub. Maybe have an option to own some kind of apartment in the area so people have a reason to come and go more. With instanced interiors it could be a thing.
---
Just a quad 1* laser. I have a qffr 2*. It allowed me to kill a.mole miner.or two at lvl 5 before it broke easy low lvl xp.
---
I got the request pop up but youre not on my social menu, whats your user name
---
Agreed
---
Set up your camp on the cliff overlooking Huntersville. There's a lead deposit there and you can set up an extractor there that gets you 14 lead/hour. Super duper helpful. When I'm fully zoomed in on the map my vendor icon is directly above the water tower on the image. Hope you're able to find it!
---
Well, not exactly "just playing". You'll have to do challenges for the SCORE and getting cosmetics through it. Which is just like doing challenges for atoms and getting cosmetics through them. But with atoms at least you choose what you want.
---
I've been farming for it since February with no luck. February 2019. There was one month I didnt nothing but farm the asylum.
---
I became a simple water farmer to feed My kin. Then i did some mentats one day outta boredom and started selling ammunition and arms. Now them folk up north wanna take my bidness away. No more possum bacon and ribeye for mines.
---
There’s little boxes that periodically unearth themselves as the quest goes on.  They have some caps and a random assortment of metal scraps.
---
I managed to stumble into one once when I was around level 30-something, still breaking in my excavator armor.  Loved it. Best. Nuke. Ever.  Level 50 Glowing ghouls around every corner, which woulda destroyed me, but there was a crew of 4 high level peeps making their way down every street and one of them was a shotgun build.  You know what I'm saying.  He'd take out the legs and give everyone a chance to tag, then whoever felt like it would headshot the pricks for all to enjoy. I never got to thank them, but that was easily my favorite time in 300+ hours of 76.
---
Ahhhh I gotcha. Thanks
---
Rad monkeys would be terrifying. The sheer sound they’d make. The incredible radiation-enhanced strength. They’d tear your dick off like a piece of paper.
---
Yeah. just like the Water Well that costs 750 gold bullion and is basically a (bad pun ahead) watered down Water Purifier.  
---
Both give you rad-free water but you cannot sell the water from the wall (if you collect from it then you get dirty water)
---
Good question. Do they ever split the bundles? I would love some of the new power armor skins but they’re bundled with a bunch of other cosmetics.
---
its blueberrisundae
---
Sadly no :/ I made the mistake of just buying the walls and the porch didn’t come with it so I had to suck it up and buy the bundle
---
wonder if missiles and mini nukes are going to be left out like the ammo plant wont make 50 cal
---
I don't love it but It's kind of cool to be honest
---
Metal gear solid: war has changed
---
Fallout: War never changes
---
Who do I believe?
---
Yeah. Good way to get perk cards if you're level is too high. I just hope they give us more interesting legendary perks than those shown in the PTS.
---
They already have those, they're called devs.
---
exactly enough to make 2 yellow in sbq area
---
at the Pioneer Lookout ready to jump if you wanna tp to me. Anyone else needs it, welcome to join :)
---
well i’m glad me and op are not the only ones to have this happen to
---
Honestly the bundle is so worth it, I highly recommend the purchase. It has a really clean look that fits into the game nice
---
I hate that we have to apply exclusive skins just to prevent selling our stuff accidentally. We are working around a design flaw of the game.  
---
The only way to mark items are non-sell able is adding them on the favorites wheel and for that we have limited slots. Plus those slots are used for more important things like RadAways, weapons, etc.
---
Dude, for real? I hope you find one soon! Sounds like you've earned it!!
---
Yes, i agree. I really hope they change the legendary perk cards!
---
good to know, i can have a bathroom break if i see this event come up lol
---
It's starting to push me away. People argue that "It holds back the cheaters" when it freaking doesn't. People who cheat will always have enough legendaries for scrip, caps and notes for the gold. 
---
Having a cap on caps only makes it so high value weapons can only be traded as opposed to selling with caps, now you have to rely on the trust of the person trading item for item since the trade system is only built for cap trades.
---
A cap on max scrip, makes no sense in the first place, especially when you can only get roughly 200 a day (dailies included). Why have a max cap when you have a daily cap?
---
Same with the Gold Bullion. You need several months worth of logging in the get everything, yet I'm only able to hold 5,000?
---
These limits are driving me nuts. I don't want to have to board up my shop when I start to approach max caps, or even log out when the person is still at my camp and risk them losing their caps and not getting the item. I want to be able to save my scrip in case I decide to buy vault steel and modules. I want to save up my gold so I can buy all the armor pieces I want at once
---
Damn. Now it just bugs me, lol.
---
This made me smile
---
You must pay for your crimes by getting rid of your 1* nocturnal pipe bolt action rifle
---
Ok I have enough I might! If it’s the only way I can get a porch I might as well!
---
&gt; whitesprings station in either the blue suitcase or the cloth sack on the left side of the door
---
Also check the filing cabinets just inside the door, I've had some luck there in the past.
---
I’m just gonna suck it up and do it then :/
---
I’m struggling for ammo and a level 10 gets a infinite supply
---
I just hope we can convert .50 ammo at good rates. The ArmCo Ammo Machine really hates .50 ammo. Takes 10h to full the machine! And the .50 call eats through it.   
---
They're probably trying to avoid giving too much ammo to snipers with .50 receiver on the hunting rifle. I get it. But honestly there is no reason to use a hunting rifle as a main when you have the Handmade and Lever Action Rifle. I run a Bloodied Explosive Handmade for my sniper and if can't one-shot something it can down it in at most 5 shots which i can fire quicker than the animation of the hunting rifle heh  
---
Anyway definitely i'm looking forward to the ammo converter! I always give all my spare ammo for free but now i'll be able to convert them to something useful. Also really hope we'll be able to convert to magnetic ammo!
---
If youve already got the mats (high radiation fluids, glowing and hardened mass) palace of the winding path is a good option too. Flux of all types.
---
Yeah it looks kinda cool. Doesn't work for my camp though but i can see it's nice.
---
They said it is a gigantic plushie. I wonder how big exactly will it be!  
---
Although since Sheepsquatches always drop some specific bones and components i was hoping for something more scary.
---
Rad-‘toa(d)t’ bag?
---
The server doesn’t render objects the client does but it does need to account for all your glitches out placements and ai pathfinding around them.
---
Nope, can confirm.
---
I love when becket locks onto my tinker station from all the way across the room and takes his time to walk over, making it inaccessible until he can come over and I kick him off.
---
Yes they are capable of more and some people here are used to living with their choices but you forget most people who came to 76 only ever play fallout 4 and where never forced to live with the choices you make also keep in mind the same people want better of intricate events and cant even figure out how to do encryptid
---
It’s probably because your a Karen
---
Im not complaining about the grind. I accept that I theoretically have less to strive for if I didnt get these cosmetics but I still have a lot to get as I don’t have any PA plans better than ultracite.  Frankly otger than stability issues I think the game still has a lot to offer.
---
Bffr 25 vats fixer or handmade
---
YES PLEASE.   
---
I've been talking about this since BETA. Things got better when i got an SSD but still it's such a PITA.
---
Just rolled a new character i planned to be a junky and this answers every question i had so thank you!  
---
I've noticed you have both travelling pharmacy and thru hiker, i started playing post wastelanders so the only backpack mods i'm really familiar with are the settler/raider ones, just wondering what backpack mod you use over the 2 i mentioned? And if it's really worth going for to free up those 3 points, i'm gonna roll a melee/shotgunner if that makes a difference, cheers!
---
I haven’t played since the beginning of June. Bored and tired of all these limits. I get the limits on Caps and Gold Bullion, but weight, Scrip, and other cool downs need to be taken out as much as possible.
---
That doesn't mean anything, it doesn't excuse anything, they are literally doing less and less each game...
---
Nice work. I love my junkies gauss. I wanted a junkies but if I had got a bloodied I would have went bloodied. I can kinda do a slight hybrid build as I have bits of unyielding SS and am working on making the other 2.
---
I'm curious why you wouldn't just log off if you saw that your camp was about to be nuked. I haven't had to make that choice yet.
---
1K not 10
---
YEESS!  
---
Just like The Outer Worlds. When you go to location it gives you the options to where you wanna go.  
---
Makes a hell of a difference. Especially for players without an SSD
---
While i haven’t attempted it, i am terrified to do this event solo
---
I’m trying to think of other games I play that do this this much and I really can’t. Maybe Destiny 2 but imo there’s so much to do I’m never just standing around doing nothing.
---
If you give Polly the Assualtron body, you get her old head as a helmet. They should have just given that special stats.
---
Not true fallout 4 had more content than any other 3 fallout combined 76 is a shit show cause they took a team familiar with single player experience and push for a 4tg quarter release cause they like easy money
---
How many times are people going to have to explain about DR on this post?!
---
Well ARE you aware??!! ONE LADDER???  \[mutters\] I'm going to have to issue this one a citation." \[automatic fine 100 caps\]
---
There is no way Fallout 4 has more content than three previous Fallout games combined, it barely has enough content to match Fallout New Vegas.  Even if that is the case, which it literally isn't, it's all radiant bullshit quests with the bare minimum of writing. Just because it has a lot of it doesn't mean any of it is any good, it's dogshit writing my 5 year old cousin would write.
---
The legendary scrip cap definitely pushed me away, haven't played the game in months
---
Honestly, i'm more excited for the AR10 skin we're getting for the handmade rifle
---
The chinese stealth armor along with rank 3 of the perk that increases your stealth is op. i come within inches of enemies and they do not notice me
---
I am all about the underground building. We should have an "organic" option to do so. The only reason it was a pain to get out of your Power Armor before was because you lost the log in bonus when you were wearing Excavator. Now it is gone so there is no reason to be complaining about the few seconds it takes to exit and re-enter your Power Armor. Upkeep is tremendously less with an underground base. Like others have said, keep your caps if you want because others will spend theirs. Also, honestly, how many underground bases have been trap ones? I have never encountered a single one in numerous hours played.
---
Happened to me now I help the newbies. Its a great pay it forward system.
---
800 Treasury notes? Holy fuck.
---
How many quests where in fallout new Vegas please keep in mind also us console player disnt get any patches till dead money so we couldn't even do base game quests till then
---
i will be completely honest, your feedback is great, but did you know this game was sooo much of a bug ridden  no content piece of shot on release, for example i played since release on ps4, the initial download was 80ish go, then they had several big patches, i had friends bug abusing, glitching, and i think i was level 50 in 1 day, the xp used to be fantastic, the weapon damage got nerfed, quests just ended. watoga ribs were the biggest assholes next to unkillallable queens that just fly away and went nah not today, the silo hacking (pretty sure you can still do that), the overseer at a resort saying she was about to die (drama queen)
---
i stopped after a year 
---
i’m currently about to have surgery so i brought for pc, and you know what i love it, i’ve done a run thru to a lvl 69, now i’m 47 ingame on pc.
---
hit me up pc users,  sonofarobot sneak/range in the chinese armour, with 2 shit limb damage gauze rifle.
---
I imagine because of events. You're put in a team for events... so people would just show up to events and not do anything and reap the xp/rewards. I think this is Bethesda's happy medium
---
Fixer with this combo of legendary effects:
---
Bloodied or Junkie's
---
Explosive or faster fire rate
---
25% less VATS cost
---
One other point I would like to make is most people would have to exit it anyway to compare your regular armor to those in vending machines.
---
It's all a money grab. Todd didn't even sound convinced when promoting the game. They take longer for each release and lose more players each time. So these online hijinks keep the bucks rolling in during their downtime. FO4 did have a ton of content, and I grew to like it more over time, but they keep going in the wrong direction; main stream hand holding. Fingers crossed for Starfield
---
Hi yeah that’s been a common answer, but I’m just wondering why it’s so universally agreed upon.
---
Sad to say but 12k is WAY overpriced... I have a quad ffr and I wouldnt even try to sell that for more than 5k. It breaks constantly and doesn't do much damage. It's good for events like uranium fever and faschnacht where you want to definitely get a hit in on something but not deal lots of damage.
---
Yes fingers crossed
---
Yikes
---
I love it! I have some perk cards that help. I can sneak right by enemies and they don't see me. I only do this when I'm just trying to get in and out of somewhere, but I love it
---
Oh yeah it’s terrifying hearing that Baaaaa follow you but even better once you end it’s baaaa. But if you have the Chinese stealth suit, it does make it easier sneaking to each conduit
---
My ammo creator is impatient for meeting it at the workshop.
---
Your junk would be sitting there waiting for you anyway if it did happen. Besides, you should be putting your junk away ASAP beforehand. When I build mine I always have a stash box and scrap box above ground so you can.
---
Bruh if you have a built in off switch then you not only completely agree with my point of view, you're taking active steps to act the way I want people to. All I personally care about is wasting my time and caps traveling to vendors who leave the server when i'm in the middle of buying their items. If you take your vendors offline when you're near the caps limit, you're quite literally doing exactly what I want you to. That begs the question: why tf did you even comment in the first place? Lmfao
---
You could say he meant disappeared but I guess it *Depends*
---
my god i loved fallout 4, i want a dog...
---
One thing by buddy told me was apparently the high capacity backpack lowers your rad resist.
---
I think pre cluttered shelves would be a great prefab addition. We already see these elements in the Fallout 1st Settler tent.
---
We need realistic skins for all weapons especially Fixers, 10mm pistol, 10mm smg, light mg, and crossbows. Also need noise suppressors for 10mm smg and light mg.
---
So let me get this straight, you didn't even play the base game FNV? And yet you're making such bullshit claims? Wow.
---
I do them all juiced out of my mind (all stats as high as you can get them). I think it's like the purveyor used to be, before they nerfed her and made it all rng. You could get some really sweet pieces juiced out. World drops used to be tied into certain special stats too imo. Todd must laugh when he sees this stuff. https://imgur.com/a/MlerKmo
---
Just my opinion. I can only go by my own experience.
---
Whatever, I enjoying it and the game itself.
---
I sneak past scorch beasts so yeah, the Chinese stealth armor was totally worth it
---
No no i played it thoroughly , where did you get the idea I disnt play the base game considering how crazy hard every dlc is that wasn't honest hearts
---
... Wasn't there an atom shop loot bag skin of a lunchbox? So when you die your stuff looks like a lunchbox?
---
Idek what a fixer looks like yet. I could just Google it, but I feel like I should find it on my own in game. Still everything you listed would be great. Especially the realistic part. It's insane running around with cheesy paintjobs lol. I guess this firefighter skin is pretty decent imo. Still something like a spooky grotesque moth man decal would be great. Similar to how the statue and mounted head looks.
---
Any area you have to load into (click to enter) is actually under the map or in the out of bounds area anyway.
---
That's why skins are needed for scout armor. Frustrating...
---
Anything that has to do with the lever action rifle. I can crit 2k+ while in stealth.
---
I have a junkies explosive hand made which is none auto which I use for day to day as I have all rifleman perks, I also use a tse lever action for high damage
---
You fall until you die, but your junk sits on the ground where it happened so really no big deal.
---
My camp is at the top of Seneca Mtn, I may need to try that.
---
In terms of rifleman alone, I’ve always liked the Lever action. It’s cheap, easy, and packs a punch. Hunting rifles are cool too, but they’re just so slow. 
---
I think I would be a fan of the Gauss rifle if it wasn’t so bugged in Vats.
---
Also important as it wasn't mentioned but the flux you get from flora is in aid as "raw" and will 'spoil' and become inert flux so that is why you need the materials (glowing mass, high radiation fluids and hardened mass) to stablize the flux permanently as "stable xxx flux" which will now show up in your junk.
---
Other suggestions: I would include Rank 3 Bloody Mess and Tank Killer. That's another 15% additional damage and armor penetration, have eagle eye mutation and vat crit her in the head as much as you can. Use the perforating magazine and suppressor mods. 
---
Using Adrenaline perk cards is always handy as well, given you need to clear mobs as well. That's free damage increase of 36% if you use only rank 1 and kill 6 creatures.
---
The only other thing I'd recommend is a full set of unyielding armor. Get your agility as high as possible so you can stay hidden for longer and do that extra damage.
---
I've soloed the queen many times using a hand full of different weapons. Automatics are definitely the way to go.
---
It does, but i use a lead lined one so 🤷‍♂️
---
If you read the notes. It specifically mentions a cap on the ammo currency. It's not a problem unless it's stupidly low
---
Oh boy there is something I'm not doing right because I do 10 dp with the final word.
---
Blodied Lever action is my go to, packs a punch even without the rifleman perk cards and fun to use. A regular assault rifle is a pretty decent choice, the reload speed is really fast and how easy it is to get mods for it by just killing super mutants and scrapping the ARs makes it a good choice if you have junkies, or bloodied or even instigating. The down side being the damn things looks like a ton of soda cans taped together lol
---
Point I'm making is that even with all those stop gaps in place I am still frequently left with the choice of either letting someone buy things without recieving compensation or leaving the world while someone's shopping. I was HOPING you'd see the light and stop whining about something so trivial. That's my bad, forgot I was on the internet. Carry on being entitled and unreasonable. Have a shitty day.
---
You on xbox?
---
Instigating explosive faster reload lever action.  Wouldn't trade it for anything.  I am a melee build and this gun can cover most anything with no perk investment.
---
Also dear Bethesda please fix the fast travel bugs ffs
---
The first 2 in your list are PC problems i believe, 3rd is expected if youve ever played a bethesda game amd the 4th is a gaming problem (call of duty warzone for instance has stupid big updates of about 30 to 40 gb)
---
What do they look like? Pic?
---
Aw thanks you too
---
We definitely need an item trading system. The risk of trading item for item is silly. The vendor/trading minigame would be 10* more fun this way.
---
After speaking 20 minutes over there I can tell you from my personal experience, it's not, as the loot bag is clearly located far underneath (  there is a quest indicator to inform you the location and range ), and scrap box is only useful for FO 1st owner (I am not)
---
To answer previous question - well, end up losing all junks from one of my characters' inventory (included around 120-130 stable flux. )
---
You don’t have to go in
---
This may be a lil biased but i like using the combat rifle since it was my first decent roll with bloodied explosive and with gun fu and adrenaline its an easy mob killer thats why it's my favorite
---
77Six-Six66 if you need me to die for you,  then I’m your man. I will jump of buildings,bridges and even high mountains. I’ll do anything to help out a fellow tadpole!
---
I doubt it, cuz they know they’ll lose a lot of players if they do
---
When im not in PA i always have the chem back pack mod. Freeing up 3 points in strength for other stuff is really helpful. Like barbarian or the 3 points in shotgun perks. I carry tons of stimpaks on me for extreme survivability so the 90% reduced weight is a must. 
---
I never used to have thru hiker, but I have grown to love it more and more. I tend to carry like 100 bottles of whiskey and 100 mountain honey moonshines on me always, so this really makes life easier. I also have tons of melons. Cant forget the melons.
---
Your reaction is so overblown its hard to believe that Bethesda isnt paying you to swallow every thick bit of filth they pump down your throat. They release things on Tuesdays right!? What about the FOUR OTHER TUESDAYS IN JUNE!? 
---
If one person even said once that it was a late June update it wouldn’t matter, but Bethesda strings people along and they get away with it because of the oblivious dogs like you that love every bit of the punishment.
---
The watelanders update is part of the game, all dlcs are just the latest version of the game although the marketing does make ot sound like a seperate entity like with some other games.  
---
The dlcs in FO76 are owned by everyone as theyre released and you need to download them before you can play again so everyone is on the same version
---
I was thinking about the monkeys from ascension in zombies, the ones that steal your perks
---
Hell yeah brother.
---
Theyre a great idea! If you ever claim a workshop make sure to throw one of those bad boys down there as well.
---
And I was using a little glitch to get infinite mini nukes and making MIRV Fatman Fireworks
---
I will happily sell .45 because of the Fixer users 5.56 for the handmade users, fusion cells, plasma cores and fusion cores for the energy users, 5mm for the heavy users and scrap the rest.
---
Everytime that happened, it was a multiple launch.
---
I didn't pay attention to the second launch.
---
But now every time I hear the sound... I'm quick at looking where it lands.
---
I'd rather have a cash register than the whole huge vendor, works better with my camp build. I have a bar and a cafe, and the current vendors just don't cut it.
---
The whole point of the lore of fallout is it leaves the answer of who dropped them first ambiguous. After all does it really matter? I understand the curiosity but I firmly believe it gives the fallout world sad lore so much more room for other things to think about.
---
 Though with today's tech wed be able to detect if a nuke was launched anywhere the issue isnt which nuke made touch down first, you said it hit China and Russia at the same time, the ICBM could have come right off the coast (like how the Chinese submarine was right of the coast of Boston) and hit quickly, while the first nuke that was launched was launched from further away taking enough time for another country to detect, raise alert, and retaliate before the nuke even hit. Plus we're also dealing with aliens that were trying to get the nukes to launch, maybe they succeeded, maybe we beat them to it.
---
Yep, if you complete an ally's questline (Sofia) you'll get a guaranteed 3 Star blaster called VATS Unknown. It's a healer weapon, always the same effects. One thing though, regardless of your level it'll be based on where your camp is--so if your camp is in the forest it's only level 20, but if you're in the mire you'll get the level 50 version.
---
U got scammed out tug of 12k
---
Clean Sink gang where you at?
---
"We must cleanse the wasteland, with fire."
---
you can find the modifier plan (fusion cells), dunno if that is enough for the purveyor, but i'm not sure if a legendary oossibility exists.
---
no
---
I have that one
---
Fixer is one of the weapons that can have its AP cost in VATS dropped to zero if it has 25% less VATS cost. 
---
If you use a Fixer with these effects on a VATS based stealth commando build you can shit out both sneak and regular crits constantly.
---
Yeah, I used to check that one all the time. I just assumed other players had pilfered it all.
---
But no, it never worked in the first place.
---
I believe it’s based on player level as my camp is in the forest and I received the level 50 version.
---
I'm sure someone else feels like that, but there's a bunch of stuff on this I'm looking forward to unlocking.
---
Clean sink, ammo converter, ghillie armor paints, bow skins, glow wallpapers, ghillie hunting rifle, ghillie backpack, excavator atomic paint, dark matter combat rifle/fixer paint, future-tec camp unit, firefly jar, CHICKEN COOP (look at all those chickens), blood eagle handmade paint, captain cosmos power armor skin, white skull gas mask, Appalachian Thunder gatling skin (finally going to want to carry a gatling), captain cosmos jetpack, planetarium lamp, oh and the fireplace door. 
---
(I didn't remember all that from memory, I admit, I just went back and looked through the list again.)
---
I believe you get something called The V.A.T.S unknown from the ally quest in your C.A.M.P. It’s not a great weapon but still cool to have. I use is mainly in events for single hits on legendaries at to bot 1 shot kill before everyone gets a chance to tag them. You can also get a plan to chance the mag from alien blaster rounds to fusion cell mag.
---
Does this also give you the max possible Claim tokens?
---
thats like one of the worst guns in the game lol
---
Definitely going to be interesting, but the vendor sales will take a huge hit though.
---
If you're running two accounts, yes. But by yourself? highly unlikely.
---
Thanks I get it now.
---
I *think* that's the only possible legendary version. I don't think they're part of the legendary loot pool, which I've always been sad about, but they really made the blaster suck in 76.
---
bffr fixer is undoubtedly the best non legacy gun in the game and thats a fact
---
Just launched my first nuke and it was Morgantown, it was my SECOND choice because I had planned to go with the flow and hit winterspring, but some poor level 21 was there. I'm so glad I made this choice. The beauty of Morgantown is it just FEELS "end of the world." The city streets just add to the stress of baddies hiding in the corners. 
---
Tons of glowing Flora and the enemies seem to respawn and be more abundant than other places.
---
yep
---
It's not. I was way over level 100 when Wastelanders came out and didn't even touch Sofia's quests until the latest patch. Still got a level 20.
---
it sounds about right, if you aren't being sneaky or have really good armor set of sentinel then yeah you'll die a few times
---
You also can't manipulate anything like you could in the other Fallout games.  What's the point of a basketball hoop if you can't play?  Or chess, or anything else that requires manual manipulation.  It's very frustrating.
---
I hope they sell Explosive lasers and B2525 Fixers
---
They've already stated that it's capped.
---
It’s also an atomic shop item - which are non-cannon, largely. It’s unlikely that this means anything.
---
That makes me much less excited about the converter now. I'll keep selling all the ammo I come across in my vending machine for 1 cap each.
---
Popular weapons most likely their main focus right now is atoms and the more popular the weapon for example the handmade the more chances for atoms to be purchased and the nerf of atoms in patch 20 will most likely result in more atom purchases at least that's what I think
---
\+1 to the bundle being worth it. Also for some reason that roof uses less budget than other roofs
---
Sounds like a little bitch boy that’s scared of peanuts. Bitch. Don’t ever talk shit about the only good peanut butter.
---
&gt; the overseer at a resort saying she was about to die (drama queen)
---
Oh yeah, there's an overseer tape where she sounds like she's at death's door and about to die any minute. It's still in the game too.
---
But when you finally go meet her, you can't even ask her about it, and she looks no worse for wear.
---
Sorry I’m on xbox
---
The glitched ones have like 800 range, breaks the glitch if you mod the scope
---
He's by Charleston fire department most times i go there.
---
I cant wait to off load all these .38 and whatever else I get stuck with because it doesn't sell and no one wants them. 
---
Dont even care about a cap limit, tired of them just taking up space (unless I drop them randomly all over the place)
---
So, how did you get around the pylon health drain? Spamming stims/quantums/SB meats?
---
I just ran into today. Been playing since launch. Never had a problem, maybe a few occasions trying to take the munitions dump. Little skirmish here and there, nothing big. 
---
Today playing with my low lvl, (25) someone decides it would be awesome to  stealth sneak into my camp and just start wailing on me. I have pacifist mode on so it really didn’t matter. I walked out my camp and waited for douche nugget exit my camp and locked the door. Hoping he would pick it and get the wanted. Instead he spent about 20 minutes just firebombing my camp. Like wth?
---
Got to point where I wanted to team up with a 200 plus, swap out to my main and destroy this fucktard. 
---
Instead I came out my camp gave him the heart emote. Just spamming the emote. I kept doing it till he grew tired and left.  Yeah I could have jump servers anytime,  but fuck toxic players like that. I get it your bored and thought it would be fun, but it’s not your just a fucking twat!
---
It wouldn’t make sense lore wise but go for it, they already messed up the lore with far harbor stuff so why not
---
I just logged in and saw a death from above successful message and of course nuked my camp.  I’m not near White Springs though.
---
Dlc was doa. You cant even trade the new items making the grind seem way to drawn out with way to much tedious/boring events.
---
Online games typically favor good Ping over population. So you are most likely playing with the same players in a similar geographical region to the closest server to you. If you want a good idea of the players in the game, using the subreddit like this one and other FO76 forums are a good place.
---
4chan has the best arguments! This sub maybe kind of circlejerky. I liked the game since it released, not a popular opinion.
---
The holiday gifts was a fail, people were farming the shit out of those and plans like the plasma grenade were in the pool. Some reason they put caps in them too. With this games dupe history, Todd must have been smoking crack.
---
You can have multiple running jf you claim workshops. I usually have like 2-3 runningt at workshops instead of just 1 at my camp
---
No matter who you side with in the end  you can do the first 3 of both sides prep work quests, well prep 3 of foundation gives you the stealth suit and plans. No Rep min just do quest.
---
Furious, Instigating or Vampire's ss 1s or 1a combat knife.  Bloodied or Junkies would work as well depending on build.  Same for sheep club and whatever the best unarmed and 2h melee are.  For guns I'd say J/B/IE25 lever or a V/J/BFFR minigun, 50 cal or LMG.
---
Expected this to be a sarcasm post about starting it and not knowing what it is then getting absolutely wrecked
---
Heeeey that's not fair. I use a .38 bloodied pipe gun as my budget weapon for content that doesnt need more expensive ammo!
---
I hadn’t considered that, but I don’t claim workshops very often.
---
That's actually incorrect as nothing can see you with the stealth suit whatsoever if you actually do a sneak build correctly. You need agility at 15 and the sneak perk at max
---
Yeah I didnt know that and finished with the raiders
---
Not to mention escape artist
---
Workshops are useless and only good for fusion core mining or PvP
---
I only claim them for lead, ammo, Copper and Acid as needed
---
*Whitesprimg*.....damn just outed myself as an EX Wow player.
---
Serums are shown in the "Misc" team for some stupid reason.
---
Completely slipped my mind you were running this setup while in PA, the versatility of this build is so appealing, can't wait to try it out
---
They should come up with a different effect weapon animation for the energy weapons if they ever decide to remove it entirely but i doubt they would ever discard  them from the game they should have done it in the first place if anything else its all just a rumor so who knows
---
Make a alt or re roll the char... Almost faster then grinding that much Gold holy crap....
---
I usually have plenty of scrap, I just like having the bot at my camp. “Why would anyone throw away this perfectly good used toilet paper?”
---
Speak to him a few times, he'll call you Justin if the daily is up. It's usually 3 clicks or so to get him to give you the quest.
---
Awesome, yeah I also use Blocker and I just shrug off melee attacks, it really helps survivability.
---
I've been running mostly Vanguards with the Sentinels minor prefix (75% chance to reduce dmg by 15% when still) which I've found to be a very face roll build.
---
Re roll?
---
Teams should be in Tuesday.
---
Nice looks close to where I'm at, how long you've been there.
---
On top of that, make sure you have the starched gene perk (under luck!) ranked up all the way and equipped full time if you plan on running mutations. If you don't have it, then you'll lose the mutation whenever you use radaway.   
---
Also, rad-x will "mute" your mutations for a period of time, until it wears off. Also (also) you can buy mutations from player vendors, but if they're charging more than 500 caps a piece, they're ripping you off. (:
---
Happened to me today, I was just about to leave then thought eh, why not? Got in there and he immediately logged out and I died. Luckily I was able to get my loot (which wasn't much) but it was still irritating.
---
im pretty sure it states that regular XP from killing enemies and completing events adds to the S.C.O.R.E. progression of the season, so not just challenges.
---
 In Season 1, you will also be able to earn S.C.O.R.E. regularly by gaining XP, and by completing Public Events. Nuclear Winter Daily Challenges will also grant S.C.O.R.E. in addition to their other rewards. With future Seasons, we plan to grant S.C.O.R.E. through other methods as well, such as through new repeatable content.
---
You do not convert the ammo directly. There's an ammo point system where you sell ammo for said points and then buy ammo you need for the points you've accumulated.
---
I have used a TS Gauss Rifle that carries the +10% damage while aiming and +33% to hit in VATS for nearly 150 levels now.  If I stack the cards correctly, I can get almost 2K damage on the first shot.  I can head shot with it from ridiculous distances.
---
Right now I don’t have a build. I’m just kinda tanky but I need to be more powerful in terms of weapons. Your build seems more doable to me because I’m maxed out at 15 strength too. Just gotta level up a shitload to move the other perks around though :(
---
I forgot to mention I use the perks ammosmith and super duper when I produce the ammo in case people get skeptical.
---
As a Full HP Build my TSE Gauss Rifle can do North of 2.5k in Stealth. I love the thing so much, it'a just so versatile. Charge up for stealth shots or max damage, or just tap fire if something is up close or lower level. Really enjoyable gun.
---
Unless you gain a very large amount at once your fine. People aren't getting banned that often anymore and the only time I've seen one get banned for ammo was because he picked up 5 million rounds. So you'll be fine.
---
Combat knife?
---
Go gurt too
---
I've become a scorchbeast slayer with that suit, it is amazing. I crouch and shoot to keep their attention and never get above "caution" visibility. once they land, i literally crouch right in front of their face and melee them till they're dead and my visibility never hits "danger", unless there's an actual scorched running around, for some reason those dudes always see me
---
Thought that was just pipe weapons?
---
I feel like I’m the only one that checks the map to see if anyone is at my camp before logging out (unless I really have to leave immediately)
---
No. People that just dupe ammo don’t even get banned.
---
I heard the ffa on the gauss minis are not working and you are not actually getting the increase, can you confirm this?
---
I've seen big piles of chocolate ice cream around scorchbeast sites.
---
If you look, it is piped into the building, so there is no place for you to get the water out of it.
---
I don't mind paying cash for a game I enjoy
---
Tag before she is vulnerable. It still counts!
---
This is a common issue in a lot of games. It basically relies on how fast your system can run.  The better the set up, the fast you load. This is something I "abused" in Battlefield and would always yoink the plane spawn before others even load.
---
ikr. Mode is literally unplayable bc of my PC being old. The last time I played a guy just waited for my respawn invincibility shimmer to wear off and I was killed almost as soon as I fully loaded in :/
---
Agreed I did mine solo on silo bravo at level 72 and ran through the majority of alpha at level 58 but others showed up in the repair mainframe section. I also wanted to really solve the code myself instead of getting it off of nukacrypt so I let the level 217 launch.
---
I remember pam was made to predict the next move, so maybe possible.
---
They haven’t gotten that far yet. Future content maybe?
---
The realistic skins idea sounds pretty cool
---
I want a frog 🐸🐸🐸
---
Yeah the lever action has always been my rifle of choice, so it’s good to hear that others have seen it’s glory as well.
---
Nah. They won't lose that many players.
---
Think about it. If the only reason these people are playing is because of legacy weapons, the game didn't really have these players at all.
---
Keep in mind that you don’t actually need to be on a team to revive an ally, just be actively involved in an event with other players.  I got mine during a SBQ event, just revived another player that went down near me.
---
Buy repair kits from the atom shop. Give Todd your money.
---
Yeah, but most people only still play so they can trade those legacies and trade in general
---
Praise the lord and pass the ammunition!!
---
Stims all the way. I had like 200 and needed to burn through them. Funny story, I was also over encumbered throughout the whole event 🙃
---
It's supposed to be based on player level, and was supposed to have been fixed recently, but it wasn't.
---
There's no confirmation one way or the other.
---
I'd LOVE for this to happen as a long term thing but if it's the only thing, maybe not. There are much much bigger fish to fry that's combat-related than specific legacy weapons.
---
I have found nothing to corroborate this. Could you link the video or appropriate source? IFAIK only the model has been mined so far.
---
I’m sort of in the same boat man. Stay positive. Best wishes too you. 👊
---
What level are you?
---
Yeah I've been to a Morgantown nuke zone a few times and it's really great for High Radiation Fluids, I've found. A lot of Scorched at the airport.
---
I hear ya.  I use a Prime Vampire .50 cal for SBQ.  Practically indestructible as long as I’m hitting a target.
---
Are they better than this? This is very on par with vanilla Fallout 4 level of illusion of choice.
---
Also, it's an online game. There's only so much your choice could impact your game.
---
I also have my camp in The Mire and finished before patch with a Blaster level 20, but after patch it became level 50
---
Yea it is very accessible which is nice. From what I hear many are just working for this. But it sort of puts a sting into new players. Why would someone want to play from scratch if they are left out of 85% of the content that has been available? Especially if said content is sort of game altering. I'm going to have fun with seasons regardless I just wish new players had as much a chance to enjoy what I have enjoyed the past year or so.
---
We need some definite boosts to some of these power armor like people have said before legendary effects on PA would help immensely even if it was only 1 star prefix i'd be happy with it rolling a full set of unyielding PA would be a huge boost to these suits but i think they should get a re-work in general personally t-45 is my favorite to wear for nostalgic purposes but get easily outshined by the rest
---
Of all the possible ramifications of adding rad-monkeys, you went straight to tearing dicks off.
---
Yeah.  Serrated blade, Martial Artist and swing speed makes any knife ridiculous fast.
---
Medics 33%Vats Hit Chance 40% bashing damage Shotgun, it can 1 shot a level 95 behemoth
---
Yeah, play with some good music. They did a good job on the game really. It's the qol stuff that gets long time players.
---
Also, once again, I doubt that's a big group compared to the overall player base, assuming even a sizeable portion leave.
---
Also these traders include RMT people so I'd be more than happy to have the wind ripped right out of their profiteering sails.
---
Wow, that's an interesting first sentence. Let's see who is faster to delete this post, you or the mod that suspends you.
---
Ok, but what's the best armor for Junkies?
---
Yep! I do this all of the time. Lode baring is a must do if it pops off.
---
Wow. You got MASSIVELY ripped off.
---
Also poison resistance is something that should be passive already with PA maybe they could deteriorate when pieces start breaking and increases the poison chance that would be neat
---
Buy it. It will pay for it's self in no time. I run it with my private world on settlements and i usually can pull in lots of good scrap.
---
It was vault-tec
---
ESO is going downhill again with their over monetisation..
---
That is fair tho
---
They can only grief if you’re in pvp or their on your team
---
Would be super nice to have a reliable database of all outfits and accessories in the game. Including Atom Shop. As far as I can tell all the readily Googleable links are super out of date.
---
Sure, I’ll see what I can do.
---
Also never ask for Caps. Tons of extra rep from Ward's daily
---
All the Far Harbor items don't make sense. Who made the radium rifle?
---
They claim its like mmos how it kills the economy and drives up prices. Or makes it so rare items are extremely cheap. Meanwhile they can't replace items unless its a huge ordeal like hackers stealing inventories, they cant fix broken missions that need key items put back into inventories or script pushed through. And because the vendors take up space unlike auction houses in mmos I don't care much for what I get paid anyways unless its really rare.
---
Their greedy behavior however has it so you can still scrip legendaries when your at the limit and have daily scrip left but won't let you scrip a 3 scrips item if you have 2 in a day left even if you're willing to forfeit that 1 scrip. All while charging you to buy back a item you didn't mean to scrip instead of refunding you further wasting a limited bs resource.
---
Aka punish accidents screw your purposeful use though. Also bugs that sell equiped items, remove items, some how scrap legendaries because the game bugged out when you were scrapping ten combat rifles real fast lol. They seriously fail at community management and game design.
---
Bloodied 50V 25 Railway rifle, per shot damage is insane, downside being the weight of spikes :(
---
I haven't spend a dime other then the initial game price and I never will
---
Tamed creature take camp budget, sir
---
Instigating railway rifle. One shot most enemies.
---
Is the tec camp thing just a skin?
---
I think they dropped the ball on this quest line. It for sure couldn't have been similar to the seasons we are getting. They could have kept adding badges and ranks. It feels like it was supposed to be more and they just couldn't figure out the bugs and left it to die
---
Yeah!  You can find where it was, scrap it and then rebuild all.  I got nukes and still took a ton of scrap to rebuild.  Had to go out junking for copper and steel.
---
PSN is Ulysses\_Jack16. I'm always on at some point in time, mainly grinding for dailies
---
AA FFR RW Fatman here and Fasnacht was a rain of boom booms
---
So I caught a player this time: After picking my locked collection to become wanted, the player then proceeded to destroy my camp and kill any other player that pursued him. Looks like I'll be disabling my vendors for a while.
---
I just earned mine a few days ago, it's been sitting in my stash and definitely hasn't changed level. Not sure what's up with that bug or whatever but I'm still inclined to think it's based on camp location based on my friends' experiences.
---
I personally run the ssarmor jetpack and it's very nice
---
People that shoot her with One Man Army 😡
---
And then he makes you pay for drinks. 
---
I regret choosing all the friendly dialogue options when I rescued him.
---
Most games, like Elder Scrolls Online for instance, have a 30 second to 3 minute countdown to the start of the match on the actual map itself to negate the issue of varying load times.
---
Bored AF, greifing or trying to get killed to start various exploits, take your pick.

Indeed. My bad, overlooked that.

Been having this issue on PC but unsure why.

From last week's ITV:
---
&gt;Seasons are a new account-wide progression system
---
Yeah but I'm looking for people to meet and play with
---
I totally missed that lol. Thank you so much!
---
Like others have said you're doing it legit so you don't have anything to worry about.
---
*Obsidian has entered the chat*
---
Is that the number your pip boy shows or the number that pops up when you hit her? I'm having trouble believing you are hitting the Queen for 200 with that gun
---
Are points limited per day/week? like bullion or legendary scrip turn ins?
---
Same here, mid range lvl 35, definitely trying to find peeps to play with. PSN: Hundredhands4u
---
Been an issue since day 1.
---
Yes. Players from Steam and the Bethesda launcher play on the same server together. Steam players can sometimes be identified by long crazy alphanumeric names.
---
I hear you but there are some folks (like me) who've got 20,000+ .38 rounds, 10,000+ .44 rounds and 15,000+ 10mm rounds and nobody ever EVER buys that crap. If I can ditch ~1500 rounds a day and convert that to ~100 rounds of something I CAN use or sell like .308 or 5.56 or 2mm I'm gonna be a very happy guy. Plus how many times have you been loaded down with missiles or mini nukes or 40mm grenades just for completing a quest or an event? Instead of dropping it off in a doggie bag or a suitcase at the nearest train station, just chuck it in the recycler and get something YOU want. I'm looking forward to it, tbh.
---
If you're on Xbox One I'd happily take some of that ballistic fiber off your hands 😉😉
---
I remember reading junkie weapons have problems where the effects need to be reapplied by re-equipping them, is that the case? How frequent does that happen?
---
My GT is COBRA 1286
---
Underrated- up vote for you!
---
This is sweet, I'm glad it helped.
---
Personally I love having Beckett at my camp. He's broken and doesn't give me quests anymore, but he regularly says "everything's going to be okay." Something about his tone makes me feel like he might not believe it, but he's saying it anyway, and I really feel better when I hear it.
---
Slug Buster, no question. It’s not even close. With upgraded Gamma Wave transmitter
---
If Outer Worlds is the best they can do I'm not sure Obsidian can do any better. That game was shallow as fuck.
---
Idk. I haven't learned it or seen my friend make it yet. I just remembered seeing people looking for the plan a while ago and wondered if it was still the same.
---
Plus it is nice to have a “person” to talk to in your CAMP (at least until later).
---
Shit breaks every 3minutes
---
I don’t know of any other online game that has this happen though maybe it’s less noticeable in others but it’s absolutely unacceptable in a BR
---
God damn, I had no idea the HMS and CSA did that.
---
This seems to be always bugged on me. Cant have a good conversation with the two. Always freezes on my side.
---
I spammed the interact button and nothing. Finished the nukashine quest but haven’t ever done the daily
---
Thats base damage. The Queen has an automatic 75% reduction as well as her armor, she also ignores explosive damage further wreaking your weapon. You were probably doing maybe 10-20 damage a shot.
---
You are too sober. You gotta drink before you talk to him (just joking)
---
You might actually be able to activate the daily using the personal terminal. I noticed the other day that it listed that daily on my terminal. But, I never followed up on it so I might be wrong.
---
I’ll check it out and report back after work. Thanks
---
I don't have any info on that matter but people here were talking about a soft cap on how much you can have. Seems like it's not timegated. You just spend the points you get and you'll be able to accumulate more by the looks of things.
---
Cant have both those on same gun. Not to be an ass, just saying
---
Leave them there, I shall pick them up eventually. I main a Bloodied Ultracite Gatling Laser, but when I run out of cores I switch to my Tri-Barrel Extra projectile Minigun and BRRRRT the SBQ with a boatload glorious 5MM.
---
Just make sure it's 1cap. If it's 2 or higher, I am not buying it, or anyone else. I usually buy 5000 per purchase when I have 29K caps, just so I can get away from that filthy 30K caps limit.

---
I use .38 like crazy due to the high drop rate.
---
It's usually less noticeable because of the way matches are started/loaded in other games. For example Overwatch also is pretty heavily affected by your system performance but since matches don't start until after a couple minutes of character selection/ defense set up the most you may notice is other people might be able to select their character before you. To some extent I don't think the problem can be completely solved, but there's certainly design decisions that can mitigate the issue.
---
We just need different bosses having a year plus to practice the queen is nothing to most
---
How many have you made? There are 18 prefixes. For fun, go to https://rolz.org/ and roll 50d18. I did and charted the results [here](https://imgur.com/xvZTHFh). You'll notice there were two numbers that were not rolled at all.
---
What town i can find this Morgan?
---
Although it's not the most amazing to look at, I have A bloodied pipe rifle I modded for maximum damage. It's crazy fast and has no recoil. I made it just to do something with all that pesky .38 ammo. Its stats aren't super impressive but it does a nice job.
---
A simple countdown that starts after everyone is fully loaded in. It’s that simple.
---
Haha he is always saying that to me too. Not because he is broken fortunately but because I am not advancing his quests. I am just super taking my time with the game (soon 400 hours in and Enclave has not yet begun). 
---
He is a good NPC, I was really sceptical at first but I love it. 
---
Hopefully he will get unbroken for you soon. On PS4 and I am lucky on the bug side for now.
---
I would like to bed to differ. Personally I have played more fallout 4 than any other game in the franchise and it was also my entry game. In fallout 4 there were several instances where you got some benefit whether it be a a perk or item for making a decision and as a result you missed out on some other benefit. For example if you sided with the railroad you got the very powerful armor linings which were one of the best items in the game. if I remember correctly you didn’t need to do all the quests for them to get the item but it was a significant item for choosing to help same with the deliverer. However an example that shows that your statement is wrong is the helmet you get from siding with the children of atom in far harbor where it has a unique effect and appearance which made the item desirable to people of a specific play style. 
---
The fact that it is an online game also does not mean that decisions can’t affect the world space. There are example like WOW where in vanilla WOW players had to come together and donate x amount of resources to open a end game raid. Also in world of Warcraft they have a faction invasion rotdtion every 2 weeks. They physically change the world space similar to how I suggested and if enough resources are donated the rotation instead flips early. So the excuse that it’s online is just lazy because it’s been done before. I think a better explaination is bethesda is too scared to do something as polarizing as splitting the player base into factions and running similar events
---
Everything will get better I am sure. 👊
---
Camp budget is what annoys me most. You ram a shop full of cosmetics for camps, but you can only place like half. The building part is what I like to do most. 
---
Hoping upcoming interior spaces fixes that.
---
I totally agree. In 4 I’d usually exit to enemies and sometimes I didn’t have enough ammo to live lol... thankful for a recent auto save I suppose.
---
Yeah we all know how to take her down fast if we want but I just feel bad for newer people who show up for the big fight just to get nothing out of it. Yeah though, different bosses would help. I completely agree.
---
They really need to fix that bug. I can 1 shot anything with my shotgun except for Scorched Beasts and Sheepsquatch and frankly its getting kinda boring...
---
Can chems and alcohol stack? If I pop mentats and I drink alcohol or will trying to use both cancel out one or the other? (Sorry if this doesn’t make sense)
---
Not everyone buys FO1st just saying so not everyone has private servers I mrel5 the queen in about a minute so I couldn't care less blame bethsda for not making private server Available to everyone.
---
If you are a PC player there is the text chat mod. It's great for organizing these things. Of course, an official text chat would be more desirable.
---
I've bought three (10k 5k 8k) and done the event countless times with no luck. Still need a few more copies for script mules, already have 1k script on two of them just waiting to burn script when i unlock the plan on them.
---
Yeah I try to be nice to new player use a crappy weapon on legendary enemies so I don’t one shot them I follow people around sometimes as a escort for the hell of it but not gonna lie for how I worked for my legacy arsenal I enjoy melting that queen so many early days of being screwed by scorched beast queen or even regular the next few months will add a lot for new players they are spoiled compared to us beta players
---
I hear you. I pretty much waste anything with my shotgun. I've got some decent weapons now too but I barely use them.
---
Junkies plasma rifle, most OP weapon I own, picked it up for 850 caps, threw a prime reciever and a flamer barrel on it and it is just absolutely insane. Melts enemies faster than any other weapon I have ever had.
---
I’m pretty sure you can murder your own pet. I had a tamed scorched Mirelurk King that was out of control, so I just put it down
---
Thanks man! Im kinda pvp build but not like optimal.. ill need at leest 20 lvls to get to my max pvp strength
---
Yeah we need a new area on the map with much more difficult enemies. When the bog used to be the bog at level 50.
---
Tried it with a flamer barrel yet? I haven't tried slug buster with it, but my junkies plasma rifle is insane with the flamer barrel.
---
If our schedules match I’d be happy to give you a leg up until you find a more stable stable of friends. Once Seasons start I’ll be on more too. 
---
IGN: Stanseas 
---
Feel free to DM me here to figure out times.
---
That’s sounds really cool, wish I could still play the game
---
Lmfao
---
Feel free to add me, you're more than welcome to join me if you see me on, ign is nukejockey or can add me to steam with the same id.
---
I'd be more for Bethesda fixing their combat system so that this isn't ever possible.
---
There are far too many ways (not just bloodied builds) that can get this kind of outcome by absolutely demolishing in seconds what are meant to be some of the most powerful and fearsome enemies in the game.
---
Fix this and your problem goes away.
---
Maybe Bethesda could also fix the rewards system for events so that people can't rush down legendaries and still get rewarded even if the event fails.
---
Doesn't she also point out the player was an unexpected variable and the more humans made results far more uncertain?
---
Check. Your. Stash.
---
Nice job!  
---
This is the only thing I haven't tried soloing in the game, have solo'd the SBQ and a wendigo colossus but the imposter sheepsquatch still scares me. I might have the arsenal to melt him down now though, I guess I should try it at some point. Time to save up some stims.
---
I have a Instigating, 33% hit chance, Dragon. For when it absolutely must be destroyed in 1 hit.
---
Ugh wish I had known that too.. great tip for everyone else though!
---
&gt;nukejockey
---
I've sent a friend request on steam :) thank you
---
What is IGN?
---
Which variation of the rifle is your favorite? I'm trying to run a stealth build, I just need to find the perfect rifle. I'm not sure which one that would be though.
---
In Game Name. :)
---
We got the t60 arm, but if you have UC reactive I can guarantee someone will hook you up with something you need.  What are you missing?
---
Making a New character with optimized quest path to make sure you dont miss a few items, leveling rerolls can be boring but it's always worth it to have 5 levels 50 ( 1400 caps×5 legendary script ×5 daily )
---
The same thing happened to me! I tried to tell people this but I was ignored! Even my girlfriend mocked me and said I was just going crazy from playing too much. And every time I logged in since that encounter the same 4 mannequins would show up every now and again at random locations. It's probably why I prefer to fast travel more, the stress and fear keeps me from walking the wastelands
---
ohhhh okay thank you!
---
I’m all for the soppy story on Appalachia radio, but listening to it 3 times a day is annoying. 
---
Please, we need more songs
---
PC has sets of unyielding ap sent and other godrolls on power armor due to hacks.
---
The base things are the only good stuff. The glow in dark wallpaper and space lamp look good. And sink and ammo converter. After that the armor and weapon skins are lackluster
---
Added!!
---
Or you could use a private server if you want to take 20 minutes to kill it...
---
I’ll get on soon. Send me the name I should look for.
---
That's barely worth 12 caps
---
This whole game is a mess they haven't even fixed the godmode bug and its been around since the beginning of the game its just frustrating they continue to focus on other things like the atoms are their main priority and dont focus on anything else this game was literally just a cash grab and has been lacking in content and making the game more of a grind fest and just want a quick buck out of us i wouldnt complain if somehow the game had minimal bugs and fix any game breaking bugs that they would hotfix immediately like other triple a games but this game is still a mess despite the new wastelanders dlc and still having dupe problems plus the atoms nerf which makes more players less inclined to play the game.. thanks for reading my ted talk

Hi I’m captaincountyroads. I’m on most of the time I will gladly add you. I can help with quests, items, and ammo. I have small group of people we are very accepting of all kinds we tend to just hang out and kill things.  My 76 username is CaptainCountyRoads. My time zone is EST.

I mean, he/she can always put the plasma rifle on a display case and admire it. It will give them something to strive for! A goal if you will! 
---
'One day, I will use that plasma rifle! Mark my words!'

WS Golf Club, lower floor on the right,on one of the shelves but be careful there is always a wendigo lurking in the area.
---
I don't know, i play on steam, i dont have the PTS.
---
I. Already. Did.
---
The patented "Kova's Suitcase-Staircase" is the best part for me! :D
---
It has indeed. Despite its endless list of issues I had a lot of fun with the game, but the oppressive caps and lack of fun activities to do at endgame just killed it for me.
---
It seems like Bethesda has the blinders on currently. Either they're unwilling or unable to listen to their community and it's going to die a (relatively) rapid death. I'm actually just going to boot up fo4 again and mod the hell out of it so I can build some cities again..
---
True.
---
&gt;CaptainCountyRoads
---
Thank you I sent you a friend request!
---
Haha rekt 😂 time to restart that grind, scrub
---
I'm not saying to put them and those hacked sets are op, I'm not saying to give those effects to power armor
---
The stakes are pretty low. Hell in New Vegas when you picked a side that was it. You just made permanent enemies. Here I sided with the settlers but I'm in better shape with the raiders. This shouldn't even be an option. 
---
Even the stats don't mean much. Using your stats to influence the outcome of a conversation doesn't really do much for you one way or the other.
---
makes a really smooth light, thanks again, will use it now :)
---
Damn that sucks. Was hoping this crap wasn't possible anymore. Can bethesda support help in this situation? I'm fairly new to the game myself and have no idea what happens in the event someone gets all their stash swiped.
---
I put a ticket in about this exact issue. Bethesda is blaming Sony for the issue. They gave me a long list of how to fix it using different TCP/UDP ports, reinstalling the game and PS4 OS, creating custom friends lists on PS4.
---
nice
---
I ran over there the last time I saw it was nuked, killed about a dozen Glowing Ones and got 0 hardened mass/fluids. Is there something you need to do to start farming this stuff?
---
Foodbuild
---
it was a mule probably holding on to duped weapons.
---
It goes well with a glass of oval teen chocolate milk.
---
Why do people hoarde that shit? Just find a low level camp, drop it and never think about it again.
---
Same thing happened to me but he helped. Was just me and him. No other players and didnt see chally anywhere
---
Don't give up, I had to roll over 40 times before I got my first Unyielding SS piece. Then they seemed to come thick and fast. Have a complete set now of 3\* with one perfect roll Uny/Ap/Sent.
---
It just takes time and patience.
---
P.S. Don't make the mistake of saving SS pieces to scrap later. Unless you find it hard to max out the 150 daily limit.
---
FFS - this bad information about only being able to steal from budget exploits is so annoying.  If a player can reach your vendor before the full load they can take whatever you own.  EXPLOIT OR NOT.
---
I never had such problem, it's maybe the old +250 while reloading bug ?
---
They made a skin pack for pickaxes...
---
Totaly agree, this whould be great for farming things like asylum uniforms, having to sit through 3 loadings between runs whould make farming them a bit less boring.
---
I also received a huge ammo supply as a starter character and it was the most fun not worrying about bullets.  I had tons of fun thanks to someone’s generosity, so I’m always happy to help low lvl players.   But I also had a low level player help my high level character once...   he was passing by my camp and we chatted for just a minute.  I mentioned I was about to do a scavenge run for wood since I was out, and he promptly dropped a few hundred of wood scrap before going on his way.  Always great to meet helpful people.
---
No, this kind of thing won't introduce any server strain
---
Poor low level. They will take all those mini nukes and missiles and be thankful. They will think that someone is looking out for them and gave them some awesome ammo for the future. It will only be late game that they realize that the ammo is garbage dead-weight and that they had wasted the space on it all this time...
---
Just sucks how much it costs to make 2mm compared to .50 and 5mm. So you have to be so much more careful with the trigger.
---
Especially for the enclave headquarters
---
Thank you so much
---
i was confused when you said melee then i looked at my build planner and saw what you meant that was not what was to be there that was suppose to be the other shotgunner perk
---
but anyway i can see what you mean with the other stuff, i didn't know about the diluted rad-x thanks. so should i max out iron clad or get a different 2 star perk
---
green thumb is a place holder because i realized i didn't have a perk there and didn't know what to put in its place
---
Think I could do it with a shotgun build?
---
It may sit because when people work out a deal it often goes for .5c/ea since so many more are crafted per click.
---
You should be fine as you build it up over time.
---
What’s your method for farming WS on a private server?
---
I never get that much... I launch go do something else for 20 minutes then make a run , go do something , then head back after a while.
---
I’d love a better method as I use ultracite .308
---
I’m curious how he just costs very few ap when doing per shot in vats. I saw him shooting 6 times at half of ap
---
What are you talking about? The badges were easy to complete, All of them reward a badge currency so you can buy plans to mod or build in your camp. I rather enjoyed the grind, but I enjoy grindy games. 
---
The only disappointment I have is people no longer have to earn the backpack in order to add a skin mod from the atom shop. As well all the duplications that were done has flooded the game with scout backpack mods so no one has to earn badges to mod their tadpole backpack. And Bethesda does nothing about it.
---
that is why I only own one physical disk for my PS4. That was the game that came with the console. all my other games are digital, so that I don't have to worry about finding the disk if I want to play.
---
Would it be better to prime them? 
---
Also, which other plans for gauss mini gun should I get?
---
I know and I love that the game is so anti-pvp. And honestly if they brought back survival servers there'd be more for pvpers too. 
---
I love how it is TBH.
---
You can stack them, often using grape mentats (5 charisma ) and beer 3 charisma with party Boy/Girl while trading  ( Barter perk on top of those ) also some mentats can stack with other drugs but i forgot wich one)
---
I use a b/e hunting rifle and lever gun, depending on what I’m in the mood for, to supplement a bloody fixer.  The hunting rifle does a bit more damage, but the lever gun is so much faster.  They’re both really great for long range shooting.
---
i didn't know that thanks
---
Stupid FAT hobbit!
---
I know I get a hardened mass whenever I see it about to be nuked
---
Lmao
---
Beast
---
exactly ✌️
---
You’re good dude, I have a few hundred thousand of the two types I use.
---
It was a lot of work (round about 7 hours) 🤣 Nope, the suitcases didn't used a lot of budget ✌️
---
He's just trying to find a mate.
---
Thanks a lot 🤣 If I find new locations, I'll do 10-50 of them 🤷
---
The flip side is, if choices matter too much, we get into situations where faction rewards become unobtainable. And on an online game, going back to a quick save for a quest do over isn’t a factor. So there’s got to be a balance there between quest choices and the loot pool. Otherwise everybody would be on here moaning about missing the Chinese Stealth Suit or ammo makers.
---
That Handmade skin has me dead set around the Tier 70s.
---
Even primed, the ammo to material ratio is kinda shit for a heavy 'spam' weapon.
---
Normal ammo per 100 rounds?: 105 Steel and 45 lead for 2mm making 15 a time, .50?: 40 steel and 10 lead.
---
Ultracite 2mm per 180 rounds (batches of 60) 3 Ultracite, 66 steel, THREE Crimson flux, 24 lead... 200 rounds of .50? 1 Ultra, 60 steel, 1 Violet flux, 15 lead.
---
Gauss weapons are pretty powerful.. but they're over hyped and overly pricey in ammo; especially Primed.
---
I had it fail a couple times. Usually because only 2 people show up and she never lands or flies close and keeps doing the dive bomb attack for 20 minutes so you never get a good shot in.
---
You love it because the pvp is garbage, they didn’t want to fix Tesla rifles and marsupial so they dropped it altogether
---
How do I find out about / get access to the ammo converter?
---
Thank you 👍 you can place your camp really easy at the roof that building
---
I don't really care tbh. There's plenty of pvp centric and pvp balanced games out there. Go play them.
---
Thank you very much 🤣
---
Are you on Xbox? I could give you like 200
---
Thank you very much  and I'll do my best 🤣
---
Don’t snitch me out! Nah kidding
---
I play frequently and also have a group of friends who really help each other out. Would be more than happy to play if youd like. Ign is Alucardx666
---
 Thank you very much and I'll try to get a patent for it LOL 😁
---
thanks for the help 
---
also thanks for the reasoning for some of the changes
---
one problem though I'm going to still use some of my heavies e.g. my vampiric gat lazer (have 20 cores right now), furious plasma caster and the explosive LMG especially for the scorched queen 
---
or should i just use them without the heavy build in that case
---
Nope, not paying $13 a month for shit service, get better at the game or land shots on her in 40 seconds that’s more than enough time, always fast travel before the event starts to.
---
That is on no world good
---
I can relate to this. I have had some personal problems on top of lockdown and fell into a depression, on top of my already worsening anxiety. It’ll sound silly, but this was the right time to bring human NPCs to Appalachia because a month into lockdown and right after Wastelanders dropped, I moved my camp next to Marigold Pavilion, which often spawns Raiders or Settlers and you can help them defend their camp. Like I said, it sounds silly but I call it “checking on the neighbors.” It helped me during a time that I otherwise felt pretty isolated and can’t connect to other people like I normally would. Same with the obvious social nature of the game. Finding positive people out there has really cheered me up.
---
I have Beckett too and he says it in such a soothing tone that it helps me, too.
---
I am looking for Unstoppables #3 for Collector and Pulse Grenade recipe for Chemist and then I will have all my badges. But I really want to be a Squirrel Scout.
---
Why not give those effects to PA? whats the problem of having PA OP, normal armor is OP and its better then PA in almost ever aspect because of legendary traits and things like backpack.
---
The scavenger is drunk that is why his shirt was off
---
Bethesda just needs to collect all those bugs and turn them into Scout Leader Treadly for some bug repellent
---
I think there were plans to add more to the scouts/badges system bc there are files for Squirrel Scouts. It may be in the cards for the future.
---
I’ve been trying to farm for the plasma grenade plan since a few months after release. I can’t qualify that as easy. Hit the gifts hard from the Christmas scorched and still nada
---
And honestly it is kind of a pain to walk to your objective each time, a good example is the Whitespring bunker...
---
I'm glad it's being added to the game for everyone that uses guns, but I'm exclusively melee, so pretty pointless for me.
---
I always head over there after a “Swarm of Suitors” event. Either get a lot of softshell or regular mirelurk meat and some times a queen shows up.
---
Why would you want to kill the boss holding a low level legendary when you could kill the spawns  ( those guys can respawn with 3 stars and level 66
---
Also the game is grindy enough and you'd "nerf" a powerfull farming method ?
---
the
---
Before scriping it, you should watch Captainoob´s vidéo testing a junkie combat shotgun to see its efficiency 
---
He also did a Queen run with it.
---
Because this will make normal armor almost moot, creating the same problem all over again .
---
There were several atom shop items that were glitches and you could build without purchasing it. I don't know if the dish was one but I know for certain the globe was one. When this happens BGS rectifies it quickly. 
---
So have you ever purchased these items? I believe they both were exclusive to bundles.
---
same here
---
“This is my spot bruh, find your own”
---
World hop harpers ferry each day. in  the building near the teleport zone can spawn marine armor plans. if it's not there or a different plan is, hop server n look again. can spawn in the displays on the ground floor and the upper floors by climbing the train car wedged into the wall
---
Is the magic gun thing even that pervasive though? The last 20 or so SBQ fights I've been to I have only seen one.
---
How is that possible? I have a pretty great Grognak's Axe and most things take two shots or three hits. If they're low level then one hit is all it takes. A Scorched Deathclaw today took me around 8 shots. A Sheepsquatch I killed the other day took over ten shots.
---
I have all 3 levels of Slugger, Expert Slugger and Master Slugger along with all 3 levels of Incisor, Martial Artist and Bloody Mess. I also got 3 pieces of Vanguard Armor. Not saying I want to kill the SBQ in 40 seconds but in this thread I've seen players say they one to two shoot almost anything. I just don't see how that is achievable and yet it obviously is.
---
Flip
---
UP
---
This happens to me if I skip his dialogue, if I just let it run normally, the rep clicks for me.
---
It is a rank 5 item so I kinda get why the conversion rates are low. You won't even have to do a special grind for it. Just play the game and in less than 4 hours you will get that item. It is there so you don't drop those 50 40mm grenades and 200 .38 rounds you never use.
---
Can only find junkies explosive combat shotgun video from cpt noob but I’ll take your word for it.
---
BE Railway Rifle. #2, BE Lever Action.
---
Would be a pleasure! i'm ign: shiraishi.ku and i mostly play all day lol i have no life. I'm usually doing dailies or farming atoms, so i could always hang around or help with stuff, now with the upcoming teams it could be even better. PS: asking for a friend, i also have none
---
did you get the fixer plan?
---
You have to have a certain luck perk set and it will last forever unless you take radx then it doesn’t work for ten minutes but it does work with radaway
---
Turns out you have to actually be in the Chassis to equip it
---
Forever if you have Starched Genes rank 2.
---
It's not the best for damage but I have a quad +25% crit refill +vats accuracy and it is just such a smooth weapon. 2 shots without the perk that keeps your crit at 55% and I'm already shooting off another crit. Very good for clearing things out without having an to reload. Also great for getting headshots on scorchbeasts while flying, which has been great since you can't cripple the queen rn.
---
I haven't found many 3 star Lever Action Rifles, but I use a Two-Shot as my main and an Explosive for when it breaks. The Two-Shot does a lot more damage. I am able to kill most things in 1 shot, difficult things like Yao Guai, Colonel Gutsy, Assaultrons in 2 or 3 shots. However when it breaks and I have to use my explosive it takes 1 or 2 shots for most things and 4 or 5 shots for the tough things. I am stealth sniper using VATS most of the time.
---
Not really you still have the backpack and the "fusion core free" jetpack for normal armor, also making PA legendary sets needing to be 6 matching pieces will still make normal armor more enticing
---
just think soon you will have to do the second loading screen to check how many 38 rounds and mounted #%@\*#\^ plans someone has for sale....
---
that’s under luck stat like srbre said?
---
People want legacy energy weapons maybe just because of the rarity factor. Bloodied fixers and handmades are more satisfying to use and the new gauss shotty and mini deal insane amount of damage. Legacy energy guns aren’t ‘the best’ for anything except for maybe the collection value.
---
The Lever Action with Speed Demon mutation is still decently fast reload speed.
---
Explosive isnt the important part here to be honest. It just shows the effectiveness of the weapon. And what you would loose because yours isnt explosives would be compensated by using VATS. Thats why you need 12 agility and Unyeilding bonuses, for AP and Adrenal Réaction and Nerd Rage bonuses. It also gives you a Huge bonus to perception for the accuracy.
---
Awesome thanks
---
Totally agree. It is a rank 5 item. Apparently people want this machine do to all their work. Having to collect junk to craft ammo every few days is a healthy grind in the game. Or if you buy/sell ammo. 
---
We already have an ammo generator. I don't want my camp to be a huge ammo factory. Then all the ammo would loose a lot of its value
---
I had a quad faster reload lever action, I named it Speedy Pete, after easy Pete from NV
---
plus it has the best sound effects
---
Gonna be real for a second. I really dislike the aesthetic of T-65. It looks.... Fat. Like Peter Griffin fat. 
---
I'll stick with Ultracite and X-01 (once I get some lol)
---
I mean, just test it man, do one Westek run using Vats, youll see what u mean ;)
---
Can’t you just fast travel just like everyone else and get a shot off.
---
Request accepted. Logging in now.
---
ya gets a bit boring after the main story and you've killed the scorch queen 1,000 time.  lvl 143 about burned out myself, started when wastelanders came out.
---
on the other end. I had a faster reload Hunting Rifle and it still took a day and a half to reload.
---
I wholeheartedly agree. Poison resistance should be fairly high (though, in-game, it is also somewhat defined as "acid" damage) and all external diseases should be outright incapable of affecting a power armor user.
---
Not to say that other diseases **shouldn't** be dangerous. Things like parasites and dysentery are (typically) from ingested things, after all.
---
I had some plans around T-45 and what direction it could go in terms of set bonuses. My friend and I came to the conclusion that T-45 would be the go-to VATS power armor with several inherent bonuses to VATS and AP usage.
---
I'd say it's critical with any scorchbeast
---
The queen is a laughable end game.
---
I've been there very few times, she never even remotely tried to kill someone, I just do my little damage running around like an idiot (shotgun ain't got range...), collect a shit legendary and random rubbish and go home check my tato plants. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
This is great- thanks!
---
I've had the game since launch and my hunting rifle still isn't reloaded dude.
---
For marine you can try the Ranger station, C2, NAR, Flooded Trainyard, Forward Station Delta and Taggerdy's office at Fort Defiance.
---
Yeah mate
---
I feel it's gonna suck and just disappoint everyone, Bethesda is super good at this.
---
I would be more excited for bug fixes and performance ones more than anything, my game is unplayable with all the stuttering for example.
---
Easiest way to get more dps is run the adrenal reaction mutation, and lower your health
---
Try getting a tattered field jacket, leather coat, or responders firman pitfit
---
Thing is I run bloodied on my two main characters and no way can I do this crazy damage, as I've said here only if I'm at point blank range I hit around 100 per shot but average 30, there is something else as work here.
---
Try running a normal bloodied build without cheats and you will see, I am however not melee and 3 base strength.
---
Did you play the other Fallout episodes much? There were a bunch of western outfits in the nuka-world expansion on FO4 and more on Nexus
---
You could run a modding service once you know everything
---
Best answer ever I hope the tatos are ok we should get some good oil  and fry them up with some Salisbury steaks and a cold nukashine 👍
---
The satellite dish was absolutely one of the bugged Atomic Shop items you can (could?) build in other players camps.
---
This must be why I see relatively so few nukes now, people must just be doing other things, or at least the majority now only run silos on private with friends.
---
Yea my health is usually at like %25
---
Exploiting a bug in the game doesn't make you good sparky. It makes you an asshole.
---
Adrenal will help a lot then
---
I run a half health junkies build, and with adrenal you really notice the difference at various health levels
---
Serums, bloodied builds, strange in numbers, and food buffs.
---
I don’t use crazy weapons I use a aa limb dmg Gatling plasma and a junkies plasma caster but ammo is hard to get for it
---
fuck it  im going to follow the build
---
Its awesome, frequently get rarer bits at super low levels, like ultracite and ballistic fibre.
---
Or even just a gun, without the plans. I’m a level 24
---
I honestly feel like she needs a buff or rather a rework to the event. It feels kind of boring to just fight her and her being a bullet sponge target with nothing else to offer, she just lands, you shoot her and done. I'm a rather new player but doing the event is no fun if people just kill her almost instantly, it's end game content after all but it doesn't feel like it
---
One may as well allow terminal use on public servers so we can run: 
---
🙄
---
    KillAll
---
    tgm
---
    player.additem [god weapons] [1000]
---
they will still fire at the area you fired from, but that doesn't mean they saw you. just step 5 feet to the right and they will fire and run right past you.
---
You mean... swole.
---
I’m in love with my tse combat rifle it’s not crazy good but I like to mix it up from using heavies
---
Doesn't sound bad at all.
---
This is actually a netcode issue I think based on what I've observed. That is, I can't melt the queen 1 v. 1 on a private server. I've tried a couple times now. What seems to be happening is the way the game is handling the FFR damage is bypassing her DR somehow.
---
Also, she's hella harder 1 v. 1. Whenever you die, she regens.
---
She only agro's on you if you actually do some damage...
---
If I fits I sits.
---
Same here.  I plink away with a Blooded Vats Fixer that does very respectable damage to her (up to 486 / shot at night with Mr. Sandman at close range), but not enough to melt her or seriously threaten the ability of other players to get their loot.  I still get the Blooded FFR LMG out to do the last 1/2 to 1/4 of her health after she's regened to get it over with.
---
Making a bullet sponge even spongier sounds obnoxious to me.
---
That's really clever using the counter pieces around the front of your cafe.
---
This game is a butchered (and maybe you don't like fat) version of another game. This part of crafting is vestigial, even as it stands it is rendered nearly meaningless in the game loop or larger arc.
---
How did it get up there? Why?
---
Holy shot the solution to all the games issues was right there in game all along! Silly Bethesda bugs are for Treadly!
---
5 pieces of unyielding armour bumping your strength up, adrenal reaction serum, nerd rage... It is possible to learn this power
---
Help pls!
---
Maybe the scorched beast queen one that doesn’t come from presents but still quite a common drop
---
It's smooth af. I use it and a bloodied explosive handmade with an AP .50 HR for backup if I run out of ammo, or for SBQ when I crit. Obviously the bloodied handmade is best for dps, but the lever action hits about as hard and is better for sniping.
---
Drop your hp to 20% get nerd rage perk in intelligence and adrenal reaction serum.  I would also recommend getting a bloodied heavy weapon, but the first two things will make your damage go way up
---
But I enjoy killing ghouls.  They're so shootable.
---
MrGame420 I play daily
---
A bit soul destroying, I shall probably run some more silos on public but with this happening and the game doing a CTD and loosing the nuke completely it is hard to want to really.
---
If I saw just the helmet, I’d think the rest of the armor would look way cooler than it actually is. I don’t hate it but they could’ve done so much better with it
---
Of, course. Of course I get down voted. Why can't reddit take a joke? Not mad, but I just find it very funny that some users don't get that I'm making fun of the fact that players will drop a lot of duped items and OP said it was a "seemingly unlimited supply of ammo."
---
Anyways. It's humbling that you're giving him a shout out, but as others have pointed out, it's not really that much of a loss for long-term players and you probably did him a favor in freeing up inventory space and putting the items to good use. I do the same time to time, but even with the gift emote, lots oh newbies don't know that I'm trying to give them stuff.
---
No, there's a specific perk for pipe weapons (Licensed Plumber). You can use Gunsmith and also Weapon Artisan to repair your weapons to 130% of the condition.
---
On the nukes I've run and only a couple of others turn up they tend to sit on the fence or a tent,  I fast travel away and do something else, I don't want to waste all the ammo to be honest.
---
👍
---
Amen to that we are all just having fun in the wastelands
---
Well done! It's something I haven't done myself yet after 1000 hrs but I do need try. Encryptid solo is your next challenge.. I managed to do it solo as bloodied commando last night tanking 3 pylons and taking out the imposter. Preparation is key!
---
I never missed a loot, so I think I hit her. If just a little bit. 😂
---
Sigh, it’s probably the item I want the most but it’s on the second highest level. Oh well, if I can grind the outlaw pass to 100 in RDO I can grind in here too
---
I really just want the pip-boy paint
---
I do this on ps4 if anyone's on. Craft a full set of boiled leather, glow med scope suppressed hunting rifle, serrated machete, a 10mm with a bunch of ammo, dog food, purified water. And dupes of whatever appeal I have laying around. I'm level 23, so I can't exactly win them the lottery, but it helps a little.
---
Playing solo I tend to do a lot of random wandering and scrapping, might as well do something with it. It's a great game, but its tricky to find players to team with when I play at odd late night hours. But with everything there is to do in the game it's still a blast!
---
It'll be just brain dead gameplay,  heck you may as well be in godmode.   You can still die in nazi armor , even with all those special things.
---
If you are on PC and run it on Borderless then that's the problem. Not saying the game is super optimized on other configurations, but having it on Borderless is causing it to run poorly even on a high end system. Try Fullscreen.
---
I noticed this as well, 5.56 is super fast though, they also sell quickly in vendors
---
The blue ridge was added with wastelanders, the chaps was always in the game, just really rare. The pleasant valley tickets made chaps and the non chaps version very common.
---
For me it’s the Ammo Converter and the Ghillie Hunting Rifle Skin. That’s all I really want for my Stealth Sniper which I use to RP as a hunter. Should look perfect with my Ghillie Suit from NW
---
Ah I tried that one solo many times. I was taking so much damage from the pylons I couldn’t shoot and open my pipboy to heal at the same time, imposter Sheepsquach noticed me instantly anyways, after she killed me once I could touch this one pylon without her noticing me because she stood by it. (That one is pricy to try anyways what with the large cap cost for the card.)
---
I have tried everything you can possibly imagine and more for the last 3 months that I am playing the game. It's the game.
---
https://youtu.be/ACWbqUaeAco
---
Yea getting a decent bloodied heavy is hard
---
Not the ones that come from seasonial events and gifts. The ones that come from scout daily keep selling for 500 caps for some reason on my vendor.
---
Omg yes for the t-45 vats that would go perfectly on my stealth character I'd wish they would implement these things than them focusing on skins for PA or new weapon skins it would make the game way more fun and diverse !
---
 do this too. and add some times the game crashes
---
I want to know that too
---
Wait what about aliens?

Does the bash work on any also? I sold my 10mm with 40% bash because I was told the fire rate has to be at 150 to work
---
So do I :)
---
or they use wood foundation over water and you spawn in under there house in a wood cage of watery death!
---
What do people do with all the treasury notes anyway? As the bullion machine is capped anyway.
---
PC will possibly be the same size as the PTS last update. Consoles, anyone's guess.
---
20gb or more
---
Except it’s not a bug I can easily kill queen in less than a minute with my bloodied unarmed build. Also her hp isn’t that high till most players start joining the event. usually starts off at 1/2 people, not waiting for people to join, if I launch a nuke, I can kill her as fast as I want.
---
&gt;Same with the Gold Bullion. You need several months worth of logging in the get everything, yet I'm only able to hold 5,000?
---
Oh shit, you're fucking kidding me.  I'm on 4800, so I'll be forced to decide what to buy tomorrow?  That's incredibly shitty design, there cannot possibly be a single good reason for that.
---
Really wish they would. They gave regular armor the carry weight and jetpack that power armor should only have. It just feels like PA keeps getting left behind.
---
Hopefully the BOS update at the end of the year will bring something nice for PA other than a new skin, which is basically all T-65 was considering that there's diminishing returns on resistances.
---
When I first heard as would be able to display clutter, I thought this was what they meant. Little did I know...
---
What’s your source? Also any idea on when you can start the download?
---
True im on console. What was the size of the PTS update for PC ?
---
Damn. Guess ill not be playing for a few days haha
---
In Fallout 3 Mothership Zeta DLC, you end up aboard an alien mothership thats hovering above earth. As you fight through the aliens you find other people they captured crogenically frozen apperantly they had been around earth for thousands of years, they had a samouri and cowboy from before the war, a soldier that was abducted in Alaska around the battle of Anchorage shortly before the war (a neat detail is he was in the same deployment as nate the FO4 protagonist) a raider abducted post war and other nameless humans. 
---
What I'm referring specifically to is the aliens had a recording of a senator that was being mind controlled to call someone to set off nukes, he resisted the mind control and presumably died. Its not stated wether they succeeded to launch the nukes or humans beat them to it.
---
Never landed? Wow that’s impressive. And seems like a crazy amount of ammo. I can solo her as a melee but I’ve never tried with a gun.
---
Don't have one and nah they don't announce that stuff, they just announce that maintenance is going to happen and that's all anyone gets to know before an update.
---
I wish I had your optimism.
---
I did not know that I barely played fallout 3 but that’s crazy the overall story of fallout is probably one of the best game stories ever in my opinion except for 76 I don’t really get a fallout vibe from the story
---
started leaving them in the tool box in the overseers garage
---
Yes
---
People actually buy your fusion cells?  What system do you play on?
---
I wanted to be that guy too but the economy basically made it so the only real progression in the end is legendaries. So all youd need is the mod plans. Having the usually way more expensive base plan is unneeded if you don't craft the thing itself.
---
It does, its just a draw back of the game engine but there are open houses and buildings to explore without loading screens. Lots actually. The only places with loading screens are instanced interiors or places with large involvement with quests. The loading times are significantly improved since Wastelanders though, and I was playing on a first gen Xbox One so performance would be better on an Xbox one x, ps4 pro, or good PC.
---
I just wish my weight reduction from armor still worked while in PA, I could do without legendary PA if they did that
---
No that was tato salad i think.
---
Junkies is the jack of all trades for damage. If you're not running a bloodied build, you should be running junkies in my opinion. 
---
Source: I've been a junkie for a year now in game and I'm just fine.
---
Psycho and med x reduce your DR? It says it increases it lol
---
Wonder if we’ll get Fallout in another country one day.
---
Are you sure it is actually this? It's easy to make a mistake with 3 different tato recipes.
---
Yeah never shoot from one position. Always move. Gotta lead your enemies.
---
That's the other end of the spectrum. If people are complaining that the queen can be killed in seconds (and I've seen it myself) something has to give.
---
Feels so odd your situation happened to me, but I was the one given out the armour, I was only level 30 or 40 I think though at the time.
---
CARAVAN
---
I do love it. Only thing that keeps me from using it is the fact that your AP regen is so damn slow. I use vats almost permanently because i cant aim for shit xD
---
The music is really great indeed
---
I get why you wanted to do it, and it sounds very cool, although you really should not have done that
---
Tbh I love the idea of vide games giving there own take on how weapons should look like. However I can with realistic skins for weapons like polished or clean with that being said I also in my total opinion agree or disagree with it but I kinda wanna see more dirty, raggedy,junkish looking skins for weapons/armor skins. To me roaming the waste land kinda needs to feel like your roaming the waste. The suburban camps ideas are cool and all but in leave a disappointing site for my eyes(no offense).I know the community is capable of any camp idea which brings me back to weapon skins . We have raider and settlers we needs skins like engraving in our gum,armor,and even walls to bring more life to the idea of the waste having more lore based stuff to get in bundles.
---
Xbox. They usually get up to around about 350 or so then somebody buys them all.
---
Why not? I didn’t dupe. It was the one where you inspected the weapon then fired.
---
I don’t get it? He gets the same rewards right?
---
I'll admit upfront that I am a nerd for all the ultra-rare/hard to get cosmetic items in game, but I am pretty excited about a bunch of the unlockable items coming this season.  Really like the glow in the dark wall papers, the ghillie suit paints (especially looking forward to have something other than the bland gray SS armor default paint), and backpack lining, and weirdly enough, even the lvl100 commemorative mug to add to my display (flex!).    
---
I personally think bethesda did a great job with their content selection for this season.
---
Or instead of it showing green, change the "screen" on the vendor machine to red.
---
Or if you have a vending machine with nothing in it, just put up a sign that says "out of order"
---
Oh. Is didnt really read the whole post. I see what your saying but theyre more of a noob plan anyways. You use them to make a bunch of whatever and then scrap those to learn the mods. Once youve done that their kinda trash
---
Even if they add legendary perk points, passive perks, and gear that levels past 50 whatever the cap ends up being will be the most desired version of said gear. And Sadly without meaningful crafting of legendaries for none expansion weapons itll slowly stagnate the pool. 
---
Its like mods that are useless on some guns, or weapons that dont have as many mods as others. Even with the best legendaries, the highest level why would I settle or give up playability when I could get the best of the meta?
---
Example 10mm smg, no silencer even though had one in past games, no sight options on a gun with no front sight. Vs smg which has a silencer and a reticle vs handmade/combat rifle which have plentiful mods to choose from while taking advantage of commando perk. The only reason I run the 10mm smg on my secondary is its legendaries and if I find something comparable im scriping it because I can't be stealthy vary stealthy if I have to be close up and nothing keeping it silent as exploding rounds lure their attention as is lol.
---
You are good. I have \~250000 (5mm and 50 cal) ammo on me and i'm fine. When i run out, i always craft \~200k at one sitting.
---
You can get headshots so yes you can target seprate limbs. How effective is it on a bb i have no idea
---
Well I’ll definitely keep an eye out for that from now on lol
---
or you get 3 people who is afk or doesn't bother gathering stuff. happened to me a few times.
---
I usually just leave when people just doesn't bother doing anything and expect everyone else to all the work.
---
Two shot MIRV fatman, I basically covered the bots with kaboom during the sloth/animal section to ensure no silly problems.
---
Wait what about targeting separate limbs? I just meant the magic LB effect. Idk if it just works on guns but I figured if it works on any melee it would be the BB lol
---
Just trade for one on r/Market76
---
If someone would leave just because they removed a weapon from them, they weren't gonna be around much longer anyways.
---
It’ll be a fun novelty, but I think it’s important to avoid a Godlike endgame experience. For me part of FO4 was ruined by the fact that I became overpowered towards the end. There needs to be challenge
---
I hate to push it but do you know if there is a way to restore lost save data cause I may have deleted it (as in my character and their story) from the game whilst trying to fix this issue.
---
Only rumors and hearsay. Nothing has been said one way or another. That said i hope they find a way to track and remove all the duped/hacked items.. Especially legacy ones.
---
The ** rifle I've been using had the highest dmg output prior to modding it. I think it was at 181.
---
I regularly sell it at 1 cap each on PC, because not everyone seeks out someone to make a deal with. There are tons of players who have nothing to do with the elaborate economic shenanigans y'all get up to :)
---
Because theres only 2 types of builds in this game. Bloodied or non bloodied. You can eaither melt everything in sight or add a slight challenge to the game and use 3 bullets on enemies instead of one. I personally think bloodied builds are boring as fuck. The value of anything not bloodied or unyielding is shit. It just sucks so much fun out of the game in so many areas that it leaves the entire rest of the game unbalanced by comparison. The game is already pretty simple as is, no need to turn on easy mode with a bloodied build. Either buff all the enemies and other legendary effects or nerf bloodied. Nerfing bloodied seems easier so i definitely think bethesda would go for that.
---
The server I was on is getting taken down for maintenance.
---
We will burn all frogs before harm comes ten feet towards our moth
---
I think an instigating effect would be pretty good
---
If you have the nornal bloodied build have you considered Revenant? It's complete lunacy and OP AF.
---
It doesn't, other effects need to be improved.
---
Wind generally blows east. No the game doesnt have wind the flags just have a basic waving animation in whatever direction theyre set in
---
Would have been nice if the badges you earned actually showed up on the possum uniform
---
I'll let you know which rifle I'm using. It's definitely not the Instigating rifle though.
---
What in game gives the vision of it blowing east?
---
Up until 50 I used a hunting rifle, and combat shotgun in case my stealth failed. If I didn't find it off a body I would craft it at the nearest level. Now that Im lvl 140+ the only thing progressing the game besides the content drip is the grind for better gear. 
---
Once I find the best variant of a hunting rifle on my main though, my grind solely becomes back up gun and gear. Even thought of making a cowboy themed character but besides all 44s being eeeeh getting decent pump shotguns and legendary lever action sucks. Finally found a okay one but because it has faster fire rate as a effect, that makes all faster fire rate mods useless as they don't add to its speed just weight and secondary effect like armor piercing. Be smarter to use superior armor piercing because it does better and is lighter, but if the speed bonus still applied Id have equipped that.
---
I would not pay 500 caps for that.. Sorry but you got scammed big time.
---
If you mean the effect, I think bash damage works. If you mean literally bashing, it's too slow on any weapon to work, with the possible exception of the minigun shredder barrel if that triggers it (but it's hard to test due to multiple reasons, main one being it breaks before being able to truly see it)
---
It could be just that server. Have you tried switching to other servers?
---
While we're at it, how about a 'waypoint' option, so I can fast travel to V76 or my camp, and then from there to where I actually want to go, without two loading screens?
---
For trade value and overall use.. I would say B2525 Fixer.
---
No, it's late where I am at. But yeah, you're probably right.
---
well its more a guide than anything else, you play how you want to.
---
if you're using the backpack mod i see no reason to use something else like bear arms (or max out the shotgun damage perks) given you're not getting in/out of power armour its not like you're losing the backpack buffs. but if you're intending to keep the gat. lazer probably swap out first aid for batteries included
---
should be max of 50% damage like junkies. 
---
Even then, as a junkies, i think that's also too powerful
---
I've always dumped mine at the train stations. That way people can take what they want.
---
There is a whole video detailed on what weapons these  broken Legendary effects work on.
---
At least 5
---
Yeah and I’d watch that if I wasn’t in bed next to my SO who’s trying to watch TV lol so I figured I’d just ask
---
When I go and nuke the queen and somebody comes up and one shots or even a few shots and she is dead and I couldn’t even get a shot off before she gets close enough is a problem I did the work let me have some fun just wait a few seconds and let everyone shoot a bit at her before you destroy her. My problem with bloodied is that almost all the time I deal with them they are for a lack of a better word dicks who one shot everything including legendaries or try and pick fights with people by picklocking your stuff at your camp and then waiting there for you to do something about it. Now there are the few I don’t normally deal with that mind their own business and don’t do what I said before but that happens so little.
---
if that makes you angry i suggest you don't buy the game
---
A lot of great and interesting points BUT I'm sure if Bethesda adds all of your ideas, we'll have an endless amount of bugs on top of bugs they still haven't fixed.
---
VATS is broken :X
---
I think they assumed people would take long enough to finish the badge challenges that we would forget to ask about asking for more better ones. Or asking for the Squirrel Scouts rank.
---
It doesn't need to be nerfed. Your trade off is super low health. I might hit hard but radiation and poison fuck me up big time even with my full unyielding SS armor. 
---
If you could do just as much damage as a bloodied build without the drawbacks that come with it, bloodied weapons and unyielding/bolstering armor would be useless.
---
Explosive builds are underrated. I have one, mixed in with heavy guns and I think it's effective. It's only trash against SBQ because 40mm, missiles and mini nukes do 1 damage to her, so obviously I don't use them then.
---
I can make you something. What would you like?
---
I have an SSD and the load times are still bad.
---
Something similar I wrote a 2 days ago
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hgnlru/junkies\_heavy\_weapons\_build\_solo\_iss\_sbq\_future/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hgnlru/junkies_heavy_weapons_build_solo_iss_sbq_future/)
---
You are confused between bloodied weapons and weapons with bugged "magic" effects. Your normal bloodied weapon can't kill Queen in seconds.
---
Oh lol, didn't mean to come out rude, it is just I see people asking if pipe guns with magic effect has the "magic effect" or other weird stuff.
---
Yeah usually they do maintenance on servers that has been up for a while. Ive gotten that message a few times in the past months. 
---
I wish we were able to start downloading updates earlier. So that people with bad internet ( like me lol ) could get a head start. You would be able to download it for example 24 hours before the update, and if you finish before that, you will have to wait until a set time before you can start playing it.
---
I thought it was
---
I hope it will be small. I mean they arent really adding in too much like they did with wastelanders.
---
You only have glass cannon as S. Vampires are immortal. Up to personal preference but if you are only considering DPS then fair enough.
---
Welcome to Appalachia, how tough are ya?
---
It's strange it's needed to ask for it. For me, this kind of "feature" looks like something that had to be from the very beginning...
---
Me pointing my flag east lol. I was talking about wind in real life
---
S. Vampires?
---
Yeah I can solo her in about 30 seconds with all my chem stacking shenanigans (bloodied unarmed stealth). When I'm in public servers I don't use chems or power attacks that way people have a chance to get shots off lmao
---
I play and enjoy playing bloodied builds in both range and melee and don’t find it boring. The trade off is less DR and in thinks it fair. They need to buff the enemies as they don’t  scale as the player levels up at the moment but if one Appalachia comes out this will (hopefully) remedied. I do agree other build types seem to be less powerful however heavy gunners build seem to be in the rise from my own observations any way. There should be no more nerf only buffs now. Just my opinion.
---
I gotcha. The clouds in the sky drift east, and yeah, I guess IRL the wind goes east more than not, so you may be on to something.
---
BE, BFFR is a thing for an bloodied build.
---
TSE got nerfed to the ground. 
---
JE is pretty good lately.
---
Obviously there are people like that but I’ve seen so many videos of people who use bloodied melee and other things to kill the queen if a few hits when it lands and other things of that nature. It might have been either a glitches weapon or a bloodied build who did it I don’t know but I was mad i love nuking and having the challenge of the queen and it was ruined in seconds after the nuke dropped. This still doesn’t excuse the people who one shot legendaries though.
---
Idk, i know its not a very favorable major on melees but that could just be because its hard to get leg shots in. I hope someone can asnwer that for you
---
Absolutely no reason to nerf it. There is no damage race/competitions in this game that would warrant nerfing it. Meaning, there is no raids people compete on, no damage meters, dungeons etc etc.. Where someone would gain an upper hand over those that don't use bloodied. If someone likes using bloodied weapons and is doing more damage than you it has **ZERO** effect on you. Lots of people think killing the Queen in seconds is done by bloodied weapons and hate them. And they are very wrong. The fast kills are done by using bugged weapon effects and they can be in any weapon type, not just bloodied.
---
You have less DR but 3+ cards that prevent damage. Plus if your careful you just kill everything before it can get near you.
---
Two shot has been worthless for every weapon since they nerfed tse weapons
---
As a scavenger / trader character who lives from selling stuff (needed ammo included) i think the conversion rates seem ok. Looks like i may still run my business selling .45, 5.56, 5mm and .308 mostly. I also sell massed up shotgun shells every few days since you need plastic to craft those, but shells always sit a while in my vendor.
---
I guess us resellers have to wait and see it's impact on the vending economy. 
---
Technically i hope for an impact on servers / dataflows since conversion might clear billions of items from servers.
---
I like 90% reduced weight for the big guns...
---
How exactly does people using bloodied affect you? You want it nerfed because you don't like the playstyle? "Hurrdurrr i don't like, nerf!" People using bloodied weapons have zero effect on you.
---
They don't even need to add anything to break stuff =w=
---
A girl can dream
---
I run a bloodied build and in most situations I never die. I have a friend who after today decided to go bloodied, we did a best out of five fight I have a full unyielding SS armor and he has a full heavy combat junkie or what ever armor, I can't remember the name. Now I got lucky or junkie is bad in pvp (witch is probably why you only mentioned pve) but I wiped the floor with his junkies body 4 to 1. Maybe yes pvp is dead in this game, but if a time arrives where you *need* to defend yourself... If your going up against a bloodied build, it's going to be a deku v.s overhaul fight with the bloodied being deku.
---
I have reread and can't tell if you are posting about fallout or dark souls. 😁
---
I'm on PC and get this but that is a recent problem for me.  Started either with wastelanders or shortly after.
---
Ahh it's sheepsquatch mating season... They have to find the highest point and stay there to become the alpha male and get all the mates
---
I feel nocturnal should go in the same category as berserkers, As I would generally call it the better of the two.
---
Berserkers is only good super early, and super late game, and terrible at all other times on almost all possible weapons. 
---
Nocturnal is the second strongest damage boost for no cost 50% of the time. Now it generally is best on a weightless weapon, but it either needs to move up to C or berserkers down to D.
---
I also wouldn't rate suppressors as being truly bottom tier. It is never useless, and never hurts you. It is also disproportionately more powerful than a flat 20% reduction by reducing the damage incoming before other damage reductions and armor is calculated, causing it to effectively give an increase to your armor values, very useful at most parts of the game, especially early on. 
---
I wouldn't call it C tier, but a respectable D
---
I use punji boards to launch the fasnacht collectron down the mountain so I don't constantly have to listen to it. Works for allies too.
---
Remember hoarding thousands of items in a bathtub and then blowing it up? Thats why it saves so many resources for it to be a static bag. Stability would be horrid.
---
I am a PC gamer that hails mouse and keyboard above all else.  But fallout man, it's built for a controller.  I don't know of you have noticed this.  But everything from building to the menu UI favours controller.
---
The only time I won't use a controller is in NW.
---
From best to last id say bloodied/junkie are top tier. If you dont wanna make a "build" then Anti armor, 2shot,  furious, or vamps are decent all around guns. Then id stick stalkers, an instigating/executioners combo, and nocturnals in the C grade. Anything else is probably shit. Like suppressors could be great for support but i think its broken. All the enemy type specific ones like zealots or ghoul slayers just sucks. Oh and quad weapons usually make a great backup weapon, like you would love a quad explosive or limb dmaage shotgun.
---
I have a vague recollection it was 10gig. About 2 weeks ago I think
---
Hol up
---
Makes sense. Kind of liking restarting your phone huh?
---
Bloody stealth commando with a bloody FFR combat rifle.
---
...you need to change your perks up a bit as I can see the damage I’m doing on her health bar.
---
People who are killing Queen in seconds are doing it with either bugged weapon effects, hacked weapons, or with exploiting glitches like stacking chems etc. Your melee kill example was most likely done with the chem thing.
---
Aslo, it's easier to get addicted if you're hungry and thirsty.
---
Switch to a berserker stealth build. I use a broken Chinese stealth armor 👍🏻 and don‘t have to repair it. But the rad resistance goes down too. So you have to use some radaway from time to time while being in a nuke zone
---
They do that and about 79% of the game community would lash out and begin hating on the game... And I will be one of them
---
Wait is the Dark Matter paint for the fixer too???
---
Hate to break it to you but TSE is one of the worst effect combinations you can get on a weapon. It was good early on when the game launched but it was nerfed. Big time.
---
I'm level 235 and discovered 2 new locations yesterday - sparse sundew grove and lost home. It's a pretty big game.
---
Then don't do it. Or do you enjoy it so much,you cannot put it down?
---
Meh sure though just wait around a high lvls bound to come around and lift you up.
---
I'm sorry but I don't understand your question. If your asking where you can find Morgantown, it's east of Vault 76. The train tracks that are directly to the right of Vault 76 (if looking at your map) is actually where Morgantown starts.
---
Nah. I’d give you like 20 k
---
You serious ?
---
When are you on? You're welcome to grind in my private world but I won't be on for a few hours.
---
Yeah why not
---
Oh okay thats not too bad. Anything around 10gig for the console would be fine by me :)
---
Nobody
---
does a senior discount after the war...
---
Well you on PS4 ?
---
Yessir, add me El-_Elote_-Man
---
They arnt worth as much as they used to be since so many people duped the coins
---
Ok
---
What marine armour plans do you need? And what platform are you on?
---
I have legs, arms, torso, wetsuit and tactical helmet. I find quite a lot of them. They usually sell quite well for about 700-999 caps.
---
I mean they still gotta worth good value
---
You really have to fast travel down there before the nuke lands and get your shots in. Its not hard to show up early and get 1k damage in before she goes down. 
---
Only time I see it being an issue is the queen killers melee builds or someone in god mode stacking bobbleheads. Even a "magic" weapon takes long enough for you to contribute.
---
They're getting creative 🤔🤔🤔
---
here's a video explaining the bug  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vno3BICsakI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vno3BICsakI)  but it also includes wearing an armour piece with 'reduced blocking damage' to trigger the effect, and how it also works with shotguns in vats since all the pellets hit at the same time as a substitute for needing a high fire rate
---
No, having 1,000,000 Ammo Points is literally as resource intensive as having 10 or 0 Ammo Points.
---
The same goes for any stack of items.
---
bloodied gauss shotgun
---
Ps4, but thanks for the offer haha. It’s a good game, hope you level up fast so you can use the armor
---
I'm on just about always, I have my own private though
---
Okay can’t find you add me Priest1503 I won’t be on for a while gotta run errands but when I’m back I’ll be on
---
Yes but instead of it being a useless atomic shop piece of garbage that people can buy to flex how much money the blow on the game, they can instead make it a craftable over armor and for the body you need 40 crocolossus skin, witch you get like 5 per completely completing the event, the plans to make it will also be rare, but tradeable. And like 10 for the head.
---
That would be better.
---
Your the dumbass!
---
"it depends, pve I do just fine, pvp a marsupial ate my kids"
---
Oh yeah sure thing
---
Nah I’m the frog
---
Yes, it should be, shouldn't it.  I just don't trust them not to mess this up somehow.
---
They can't mess this up. That is hardcoded.
---
You left your downed buddy behind!! 
---
I have still only managed to catch this thing once but me and 2 randoms took it down inside the grove where it spawned.  It's annoying trying to fight in there because of all the orange particle effects but recommended if you can keep it inside there. Lots of trees to keep between you and it so you aren't taking melee damage from it on top of the ranged.  Also when you run away scared you tend to get stuck on a tree and not make it very far lol
---
I totally believe you, it's a Bugthesda game after all, the only thing that they make sure always works is the Atomic Shop. Sucks man.
---
Dumb question but you never know, are you making sure that the game is using the GPU instead of the integrated graphics of the CPU? Happened to me once. I had to go to the Nvidia control panel to change that.
---
Don’t worry, I’m like 6 months they are gonna make every enemy scale to you
---
Yup same here
---
Magic weapons, my shotgun can one shot a behemoth
---
Because it is so far above and beyond the second place options that there is no possibility of reconciling without destroying non legendary items as a concept.
---
The only effects that compare to bloodied 80-95% damage bonus were pre nerf two shot and explosive, both of which are now in line with the other perks enough to consider but not crazy.
---
The second closest tier are all capped at 50%, but have huge tradeoffs that are varying degrees of difficult to manage, -10 special, night only, take 2-3 times more damage from everything, they all require something, and can be costly enough that the next tier down at 20-30% bonus with much less severe to non existent tradeoffs can be considered. 
---
But bloodied isn't even completely overbearing because it is to good in  a min max setting, even if you don't do anything to support the effect it still readily provides higher return on investment than other effects, I run a full health tank build for team activities, and guess what, bloodied is best because whenever I take any amount of hits I  gain more damage bonus at 70% health than any other effect that doesn't demand anything be traded off, and quickly end up doing as much damage as the best non bloodied passively. 
---
I think the damage bonus should only start at 75% health, and maxes out at 50% damage at 25% health.
---
The build would still be the best, and still have all of it's strengths, but wouldn't outclass EVERYTHING else at all times.
---
I'm running a stealth build so I wasn't doing enough dmg. After sometime, we both bolted, we stood no chance tbh.
---
Here's part two: https://youtu.be/_Uh4KtdKpGI
---
Hey i'll definitely add you tomorrow!
---
Speaking of QOL, I'd also like the option back to place a marker instead of only fast travelling. Sometimes I want to just walk somewhere but I've gotta place the marker away from the actual location. Can't imagine why they removed this, it was an option in FO4.
---
PC and a set
---
I'm sure excited to play with you soon! I'll add you tomorrow though!
---
Well happy to help either way. I'm lvl 80
---
I've given away probably a dozen of that plan before I was told its a hard to find plan.
---
^(Please just give us proper railings so we don't have to spend hours using power connectors or just defaulting to the wonky looking wooden ones.)
---
Oh, I thought you were serious...
---
Yes, you get them every month of the subscription. They usually show up 2-3 days after I get the payment mail, at least for me (CC, Bethesda launcher)
---
It takes a while. Usually no more than a day. No idea why.
---
Somebody once nuked Monongah after I took the power plant workshop. While the zone was nuked one of those defend the workshop quests started and it spawned an absolute shit load of glowing ghouls. Everybody who was there joined in with defending and we all walked away with a whole bunch of mats.
---
Maybe you missed my edit.  They already messed up crafting water, which is also just a number.  I don't know what you think "hardcoded" means but it's absolutely feasible for this to be a mess.  I hope it won't.  But all I'm saying is assuming it won't is a little optimistic based on... well... the majority of Fallout Bethesda productions.
---
Yeah dude one major compliment I will give 76 over other fallout titles is the deep satisfaction I get every time I fast travel out of the far end of an instanced zone.
---
Yup.
---
All the rest are bundle outtakes. The fireworks are a fucking joke on the player, like the meat week one.
---
Atom, GB, Caps and Scrip rewards are literally insulting.
---
Whats your psn
---
My opinion is it would be like a cellar door that leads to an underground area kinda like the overseers basement. Im having a hard time seeing the appeal of it unless it was a big cave area.
---
E D G E L O R D
---
Ah!
---
Well like someone pointed out the marine stuff has a few fixed spawns. Quickest one is probably forward station delta as when you log in you spawn like 4 foot away.
---
Top 10 strats
---
It will be useless for the Endgame If you can't convert to ultracit ammo. So I guess it will be as useless as the ammocrafter from the raiders.
---
It slows ap regen?
---
I always try to help build something good for a newbies camp. Like a fusion generator or something like that.  If they accept my invite that is. Other players should help players out. Regardless of their ranks. Shooting one in the back when their shopping at your venders isn’t helping.
---
Some did stack long ago (radx + radx diluted I think), but if I remember right it was fixed. It is even mentioned in the loading screen, so I guess it was never intended.
---
No, the lag you introduce from boiling water is from hitching server commands bc you spammed craft.
---
I mean it is something new and interesting. I might use it a bit or keep selling my unwanted ammo, since I can craft a ton of ammo already.
---
Read there's a cap on it ofc. Oh well it's still neat to see something new Rolling out.
---
True, I didn't have my lore head on. Just jumped right in.
---
But then, there's Liberty Prime power armour...
---
Yes aware of the cards but does not always work especially against those sneaky rad roaches and cave crickets that pop up from nowhere and one slap you with their antennae😂😂😂😂. Enemy levels need buffing and I truely welcome that!
---
Yes, I'm glad you agree that they messed up something as simple as a single number going up.
---
Where’s the magic in that?
---
sounds a lot better than just dropping 1000's of rounds outside the wayward
---
"Bugged" still works for me. They're bugged and going to get patched with a bug fix.
---
I haven’t seen any of those glitches or anything thank you for that information. Why can’t people just play the game like it’s supposed to be played and enjoy it?
---
Unlikely though. Did they announce it already?
---
Try it?
---
It doesn't work like that. It runs the whole list of items on you, no matter what you're crafting
---
It's that special Bethesda magic. Game's full of it.
---
T
---
Not slowing down, but its as if you are wearing no armor with any AP effects. I use AP regen armor and it regens my AP pretty quickly from 0. But with the stealth armor,it doesnt have any AP regen effects, so it takes much longer for it to regen.
---
I do have the 45% faster AP regen perk card but its still really slow.
---
Lol it’s funny I just give them a good laugh we both laugh then I go back to my camp alone ....back to my world of silence and solitude
---
(sings old mcdonalds advert song)
---
You smell that?
---
Atoms
---
Ah ha... So it was you 🎆
---
Well, technicly bloodied builds are glass canons so nerfing them wouldnt be fair if we look at their trade off. Bethesda should fix instead quantum stackings and others PVP exploits.
---
if you see one near the pumpkin house, be wary, it very well could launch you into a fissure
---
yes found the tape today, thought hmm they left this in here
---
Fuck off BOS nazis
---
“Bugged” is something I can settle for.
---
If anything.. these effects leave me disenchanted with fo76.. As so many things do.. But i am still enjoying the game. Some nice fixes in Patch 20, but still way to go.
---
Haha Welded sheet metal being a lore.
---
Get out.
---
Without the "broken" effects, shotguns are useless.
---
Just don't bring any junk on you going shopping. And then nuke their camp to smithereens.
---
Uh yeah it does.
---
Save the screech for when they add Gatorclaws. Everything else is 100% benign to your lore.
---
Yes. Not sure of the point cap though.
---
Not much mate. They were duped with last wave. I am seling them for 1/6 prize and almost novody buys them.
---
I usually get the atoms after 2 days of renewal..
---
The Germans
---
They take a couple of days to show usually. I think they wait for the payment to clear first. Blame the banks.
---
Guess your question is answered already, another way to prolong the life of a gun is the perk Luck of the draw if you can spare the points. Works best with fast firing guns, procs quite often.
---
ok thanks
---
Bizarrely, it is the Atomic Shop that has started giving me the latest new issue. Half the time, it doesn't want to allow me to browse, refusing to horizontally switch between the categories at the top of the screen.  
---
As for the Ammo Crafter, I hope it will be cool. But it is the last thing I expect to get before leaving the game, I won't be too put out if it is lame.
---
I thought it was called magic effect because it is literally a magic effect in the engine from past games like Skyrim. Is that not the case?
---
Okay, what an I missing? I'm still new to the game and have a ton of ammo I really hope I'm going to be able to convert to something else: how will I be able to get that converter that has so many players agitated?
---
I agree on this one
---
Wow, not sure if it was you in particular but I was so confused when this happened to me. Just explosions everywhere with no discernible source. Madness.
---
Do you have a fixer for .38 ammo? Anything would be fine except needs for 45 ammo. Thank you
---
Be careful what you wish for. Bethesda might just sell it back to us.
---
Hey,I’m not saying get rid of them. I’m using them, too lol
---
But the term just sounds stupid imo
---
Some do, some don't. Depends on the building and its purpose.
---
There is a new bug with bashing damage that can increase the damage of certain guns drastically, so I don't think they are doing it intentionally.
---
On PC, I take note of I.D./name. Block and server hop. I do not encounter them again.
---
BER15 PILGRIM MUSKET HACKED ITEM
---
yeah lemme just nuke their camp, such a great comeback! I bet they'll be so remorseful and will never ever do this aga- oh... they left the lobby to find a new one. plan ruined :(
---
Sadly the exchange rates are not that good according to datamined tables.
---
There were elevators in FO4 building mode, right? 
---
Can I have an elevator in my camp, please? :(
---
Yes PAM started the war
---
None and if any do, it's bug. 
---
You can get different effects from different items to stack e.g. bobblehead, food, drink, chems etc. but usually same for same will overwrite to the newest one.
---
some sonofagun banged my fem toon while she was asleep n settler forager just stares at us for minutes.... pretty traumatizing....
---
None, only one can be active at a time.
---
Oh yeah yeah im just mentioning it haha! And i agree, the term " magical" doesnt sound the best
---
 I hope they don't fix the bug tho.
---
Is it? That’s the first time I heard of that. What magic effect is it supposed to be then?
---
I can hook you up with .45 ammo as well
---
Awww u mad u don't habe won?
---
Found her in the mountains above Dent and Sons construction
---
can both of you add me
---
sonofarobot
---
I would rather do without 45 ammo bc i have way more .38
---
It makes absolutely no sense to say "it doesnt work like that" when I haven't actually said how I think it works.  Look, you're confident that this system will work well, and I'm not, that's all I'm saying, it's already been way too much of both of our time to spend on this simple difference of opinion.  Have a nice day!
---
I hope it dosent have a cap. I've got just under 200 mini nukes waiting for it.
---
SBQ won’t land if the player she aggro on is not on the land, tried multiple times
---
Limb damage isn’t exactly a rarity, y’know...
---
Got at least 3 of those.
---
Great for fetch/photo quest. If wanting to save on ammo.
---
Some days I call the game "Loading Screens 76"... :/ Escpecially when dailies take you across the map and inside builings (for exemple: fast travel to Sutton* visit Davenport*, get quest, go to Crater* to take picture inside building*, go to Fundation* to sale pictures, go back to Sutton* then Davenport* to complete quest...  stars denote loading screens = 7 )
---
I'll see if i can change it.
---
Now more people know. Good job dumbass
---
Was using vault 76 to fast travel and a new player spawns in just before I open up my map again. Sadly, I didn't have any weapons on me that I could give them at the moment(personally kinda hate the slow start with a knives, short hunting rifles, and pipe pistols) so I decided to make them a "care package" and just load them up with some consumables to start their journey haha
---
Okay, thanks!
---
I feel you. Its not fun at all.
---
Same I think it'd really ruin the idea of it.   
---
I've been thinking of starting to farm 10mm from the Ammunitions workshop (as it's the fastest type of ammo to farm there) and craft .38 or 10mm (as they're the cheapest) and then convert it all to whatever I need. Using the materials to make cheaper stuff to trade in for the high-end stuff that I'll actually use, but, I'm trying to work out whether it'll actually play off in the long run or whether it's a waste of time.
---
Turn off auto renew and renew manually yourself each month then you will get the immediately
---
It hitches on and tries to craft using a previous version of that list that you've already changed from when you crafted the water.
---
They have their fun, why not have yours. And then collect some flux anyway. You can't convince them or teach them a lesson. They're not toddlers. So it's all about ruining their fun and have yours.
---
Until tonight... I thought you were stuck with the two story options. Then I may some random out in the middle of nowhere, got the option to invite her.
---
Haven't done enough with the 'ally line' to say that there's any difference beyond cosmetics.
---
add me if u choose, sent requests to others here
---
i’m active up for grouping questing etc
---
currently lvl 47 sonofarobot
---
But the thing is you can craft railway spikes which are cheap as fuck.
---
That's how I understand it. 
---
I've seen snippets of effects in Fallout 4 (maybe 3 too) where in the code it refers to spells.
---
I think that's how we get all the legendary effects and other similar buffing/stat modifying effects.
---
Also this supports the notion but have a look around yourself.
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/3ug8bf/spoilers\_spells\_in\_fallout/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/3ug8bf/spoilers_spells_in_fallout/)
---
So Fallout 3 was literally Oblivion with guns :)
---
You cannot change receivers to use .38 or if you can i don't have that mod unlocked.
---
That’s okay. What does the handmade take?
---
I prefer Beckett just because the bar. I mainly build settlement/outpost type camps and becketts bar helps add to that vibe more than any of the other ally items.
---
Don't skip dialogue when you're grinding red.
---
Sounds like you picked up an extra "vital equipment" piece somewhere. This subverts the quest and takes you straight to the turn in phase.
---
:) Nice man. That damn 'acid' attack is so annoying.
---
Get that mofo next time!
---
yeah, bit frustrated but im half way there so ill be getting it soon
---
Actually they ruin the fun of the game kid. When i show up to an event and everything drops dead when it spawns then the game gets pretty fucking boring. Its just one loading screen to the next with spoonfed rewards. How is that enjoyable for anyone?
---
They were closer to vault 76 but I will definitely be on the look out near overseers camp and whitesprings :)
---
Its not a bug its a FEATURE
---
This method has been around for a while. Don't visit vendors with junk on your ass or buy expensive junk from other players, and you'll be fine.
---
If you don't ave Starched Gen (available at about level 35 I think) you can cure rads without losing the mutation : drink brahmin milk ;)
---
Once you don't get a Queen's life out just because your weapon has "heavy" and "Limb damage" in it it's going to be safer to assume what need a nerf, sure hope patch 20 fix this for good
---
To be honest the ammo producer from crater is a game changer enough. Energy ammo is slow producing so I have mine constantly on 5.56. Everytime I fast travel back to my camp I have 200 in there.
---
Well, part of the reason for that placement is I've sold Berserker weapons before. I've never sold a Nocturn. I even had an explosive nocturn in the store for almost a month before scrapping it.  Maybe I just never ran into a buyer :shrug:
---
Weightless helps nocturnal more than most weapons, I'll give you that.
---
Thanks, happy to ruin your fun, dickhead.
---
Appreciate it. 👽👍🏽
---
Let’s call ‘em Feature Effects then :P
---
5.56 that one cannot be modded for .38 either. 
---
I could just make you a fully modded pipe rifle.
---
I like the wanderer. I like that she plays the guitar, works well out by my camp fire and water wheel (even though its broken)
---
I don't mean someone else who owns it can build it in a 3rd persons camp. 
---
I never purchased the globe but for a few days before it was released I could build it in my camp. When the future-tec bundle came out I couldn't anymore.
---
Totally agree... at the same time, allow all players to make a build that cannot take any damage, effectively from level 2 when you leave the vault... this way all griefing will be eliminated...
---
Lets call it 'the ultimate wimp build' 
---
PS: I have no punji boards in my camp - sorry to disapoint
---
I’ll just do the fixer, thank you. I was afraid of running out of ammo but i guess i could just craft it since i live on an iron deposit.
---
Sounds like someone needs some magic in there life
---
I love her character! She’s locked in a vault all by herself. I would love it for Bethesda to have a quest where we get to meet her. I highly bet that 
---
 she’s a robot lol like Rose and her brother is also one
---
No scope on the fixer though
---
&gt;  For major effects (2nd star) top ones are 25% faster fire rate and explosive since they are the only ones that add damage/dps.
---
Maybe I don't understand something, but doesn't anti-armor also increase DPS?
---
Don't need such a build. Just make Pacifist mode behave like it says on the tin, where you do NO damage to other players, and everything will be fine.
---
One friend usually places his camp along a road near 76 whenever he sells stuff and then just stays cloaked up in a tree. I decided to join him...then ended up making an upside-down pyramid out of tables in the tree...put a work bench, bed, and made a platform out of punji boards up there lol
---
Furious blocks the magic effect. The bloody FFR one is top level :) Took me like 40 crafts to get one... And even then I think I was lucky.
---
For ammo... I was using regular (from all the crafting actually... Each craft also gives you 500 ammo). Once I ran out, I actually went back to my minigun and gatling laser 😛
---
I can agree with the fact nocturnal is very underrated, and don't sell well at all.
---
But most effects that aren't B tier don't really sell. It took me a month to sell a furious rapid hitmans lmg for 3k, so even good weapons can take a long time to find the right buyer.
---
I'll make a 20 and a 30 and give you what ammo i have. Which is about 600. GT: rammadeus 
---
I'm in flatwoods right meow
---
I mean yeah, Vampire’s is a no-brainer, but I don’t remember a magic effect that just melts enemies if you hit them fast enough 🤔
---
agreed, 
---
my vault 88 has many pressure plates and electric doors, but i wish there were more buttons and switches
---
Okay omw
---
I had a feeling that would be the case. Seemed too good to be true!
---
Haha I was talking about more players learning to grief dumb shit
---
Really got me with the “Uh yeah it does.” Banger of a response, with that logic idk how I ever thought my logic was valid after that.
---
I'd put money on there being a limit you can generate  each day.
---
I'd much prefer a limit on what you could spend (if there has to be one) so at least you could dump your ammo all in 1 go. Then trickle ammo out.
---
It's probably not going to be cost effective.
---
I just wish my backpack mod would work in PA, so I can shuffle perk cards...
---
We're gonna have an Ammo Point limit, which I'd imagine would just be like a cap limit where you can't hold more than 30,000 on one character at a time, but I hope we don't have a daily buy/sell cap.
---
You must not have gotten a bloodied daedric  sword with faster swing speed in your skyrim playthrough
---
Seasons will keep the content fresh.  It has somewhat of a times delay of items.  Sure in other games you have the whales who buy every tier.  But are few and far between.
---
Need any aid or anything?
---
Yeah, I wouldnt be crafting anything extra. Dont think it's going to be generous enough for that.
---
Only one player is needed in an open field with enough space for her to land on. Others are getting away from her radiation shower attacks and damn sneaky roaches amd other critters that bite you to death while you're trying to tag her in the air.
---
Anti armor is an prefix (the 1st star), not a major effect (2nd star).
---
depressed cuz u dont know how to be alone, but ur cheered up by a npc that says the same damn line over and over again
---
u sure u not just an attention seeker right now? dw many people in the world are and its kk
---
Throw on the perk to not set off floor traps and voila!
---
That is in no way or form the cause of people using bloodied weapons. Anyone with good build and semi-decent weapon will and can one shot enemies.
---
I use psychotats and overdrive usually. And was sure they DO stack up, now I am not.
---
I think he may have gotten the idea from one of the nukashine spawn points down south. Johnson's acre I believe it was called. Basically there's some stuff on top of a hill with the punji boards each attached to their own switch but instead of you standing on them(since ragdoll physics don't apply to players unless dead), there are bodies on them for you to launch off the mountain.
---
I did. Thank you so much. You helped me a lot.
---
That's a cool idea I'm going to start putting plans I know some where like this in hopes someone will find them
---
.... no, no they cant. But they could have a food build and pick up a bloodied to one ahot things
---
Dont know what build you are using, also dont have SS armor, but  Bolstering set can give you a "godmode" against most things in game, even my blood/uny made me a little "godmode" but I can see your point. Still think that making legendary effect only work in complete sets is a bad idea, just because I could get a Uny/Vanguard/Bolstering  etc etc quicker (by mixing armor parts) then get for example 6 X-01 of "Y" legendary effect.
---
Did a SBQ fight.
---
Absolutely shredded her heath at close range in VATS and one shotted everything else including normal scorch beasts, scorched mirelurk queens and so on.
---
So yes, magic weapon from close range in VATS...as shotguns SHOULD be
---
Your logic is that the Disciples literally invented sharp, spiky metal armor.
---
It was called "Disciples Armor" for simplicity sake, not lore.
---
Should the Raider armor get removed because that armor was invented by the Commonwealth raiders?
---
ahahaha 12K for a lvl 5 weapon 
---
goddamn, those raiders in appalachia always find a way
---
It’s pitiful...but also tbh NW has to be the worst BG I’ve ever played I just stick to Adventure
---
Not against the idea of improving and evolving PA. However, a lot of people's perspectives are massively skewed by unyielding carry weight bonuses stacking with all the other non-PA effects.
---
Without unyielding, the carry weight of both are somewhat comparable. The best in class of each are about the same, give or take a couple of dozen lbs.
---
Well, the main reason is Bethesda themselves. As they are very bad at fixing bugs and exploits/glitches. Because as long as there is a way to "cheat" there will always people who do it. There are things in this game that have been around since launch, things that most online game companies would have fixed within a day when discovered.
---
my lvl 40 exterminator's lead pipe from the sbq
---
Then buff other effects surely? That’s the issue clearly. There’s always going to be a BIS and that will never change, whether it’s bloodied or not.
---
Stuff like this MIGHT come with the Brotherhood expansion coming later this year. We'll have to wait and see
---
Yeah, just worked out the conversion rate for 10mm to .308 for example.It would cost 120 rounds of 10mm to only get 12 rounds of .308. That's a cost of 10:1. 
---
  
---
Then for the shits and giggles I decided to work out how many .308 you would need to sell to get one batch (12 rounds) of .308 back. Selling .308 gets you 20 AP (Ammo Points), and to buy one batch of .308 you need 150 AP.   
---
So you need to sell 12 rounds 8 times (because 20 / 150 is 7.5 so we round up or we'd be left short, and do 20 x 8 to get 160 AP), which is 96 rounds.
---
So in essence, you would need to sell 96 .308 rounds to get 12 .308 rounds back. Oh lawd. Bethesda gave us what we asked for in the Ammo Converter but didn't really make it worthwhile.
---
Yes they can. You obviously need to play the game more. I have 3 characters that i play. One uses bloodied, one uses junkies and the last uses berserkers. Every single one of them can kill normal non-boss enemies with one shot from stealth. And when you talk about boss enemies like for example some sheepsquatch that has lots of DR, it will take half a second longer to kill them with non-bloodied weapon.
---
Is this update 20?
---
Spread the love!
---
Equip the perk light footed and sneak into the bases, you'll become immune to the punji boards
---
wow I mean the game was released in 2018, it's stupid that the loading screens still exist, The Devs are lazy.
---
This, it's supposed to be ironic
---
i cannot wrap my head around soloing this event,
---
we were more than 4 a few times this weekend. got wrecked every time. hardest event in game. SBQ and PP is way easier.
---
respeckt!!!!
---
That’s their name now, end of!
---
😂
---
Tato soup is a very rare Vegetable Soup spawn.
---
There is no recipe.
---
The Cave Fungus Soup is even rarer.
---
Oh yeah im referring to update 20 that is releasing on June 30th
---
Sell it then...completely rid yerself of it...!
---
I can't understand people wanting to play this game,able to one-shot serious enemies. 
---
I play a s a jack-of-all-trades. Sure I'm not  so powerful, I have to use tactics and think about certain enemies and what they will do if I simply charge in.
---
I tried a bloodied build and it's booooring. The one thing in the game that needs nerfed, yet the target most of the good weapons that make sense to be powerful.
---
You're in an environment with huge, scary dinosaur-like creatures. Mutated bears and big ass scorpions, why would you want to run around killing everything like some demented kid out in the backyard with a magnifying glass and an airgun taking on insects and wee harmless mice...???
---
Awesome
---
clearly u havent played with one, 
---
I have a lagecy flamer, VE50Drwa, its like a sniper that shoots explosions at any range with incredible firerate, it melts bricks, and can onshot myself in melee range in 0.2 sec, only downside it breaks crazy fast (tnx queen for all the repair kits)
---
haven played with a E gatling plasma or laser rifle or anything, but I can imagine they're aqually good, especially if u have a real good roll like TSE or BE, ofcourse u also have crappy ones (like E Tesla would be the worst since it doesnt arc anymore)
---
these guns were not nerfed with the explosive nerf from 100 to 25, 
---
so yeah I can oneshot everything with my B commando with fixers and HM's, but on my FH Heavy char, theres nothing that compares to tickling the trigger and have waves of ghouls exploding and lying burning in the tunnels at RR
---
Bro they should just add frank horrigan that’ll shake things up
---
Wow you got really mad
---
Yeah sadly your not wrong with that that is one thing I’ve been annoyed with since “beta”
---
Brotherhood of Bunker boys will swear they're helping
---
Yea, it sucks to be a Fallout universe lover with this game... You are kinda stuck.
---
Its level 5 ... its not even worth the scrip you get.
---
Loading screens is all I know
---
I love the franchise wish someone who cared more about it owned it though
---
My nerf suggestion would have bloodied still be the BIS weapon, as the whole rest of the build is still insanely strong meaning you would still want to use the effect over all the others.
---
The fact that it can be nerfed by almost half max power, and have it's generic utility outside it's own build nerfed heavily, and still be the top tier weapon says a lot about the power of the effect as it is.
---
And what of new players who don't have legendary effects, are they just supposed to suck it up and get wrecked by buffed up legendary enemies until they grind out and get a god tier weapon that doubles the power they have access to on a whim.
---
I think the rest of the effects are in generally ok places, some are weak and need buffing, but there is only one that stands head and shoulders above the rest. 
---
I see junkies as a good example, it gives a strong damage boost at a not insignificant cost, 10+ special you have to sacrifice to get that bonus. Nocturnal gives the same bonus at no cost half the time, but is bad the other half, berserkers gives the same bonus as those two in exchange for a penalty not dissimilar to bloodied, 
---
Berserkers is the best example, it asks a similar durability loss to bloodied for offense. But is not supported by perks, has a way more severe downside, and gives you way less offense for that huge sacrifice. Bloodied asks nothing and gives huge returns, so strong that you want to sacrifice to get those returns even though you don't actually have to.
---
That's literally the only major that spawns on buzzblades....
---
Gotcha, so then it could be a good thing then for those who have maxed raider rep and have the ammo machine that you could just have that produce the ammo for you, in my case since the 2mm ec is not an available option in the ammo maker. Now i assume you mean “sell” is to the ammo converter?
---
Are seasons included in this update?
---
I mean, I’m fine with most of the armor pieces. The disciples gear for example is mostly just metal scrap but the headwear and apparel is really what gets me about the rest of them.  Again, like the suits from the operators I think is fine too because they just look like pre-war suits imo. There’s just certain distinct markings or designs on either some armor pieces or under armors.
---
They do, but you should be using Quick
---
One reason and one reason only for caps afaik:  
---
Bethesda can't confidently believe that they have fixed duping once and for all, so they are capping it to limit damages.
---
Awesome they finally have the ammo problem soon fixed it will be welcomed very much so lol but truly I will miss fining ammo I use everything in bags or just people giving it away lol I had doing the grinding foe ammo lol but oh well things will always even out sometime lol
---
Haha
---
"Painspike Armor"
---
"Fancy Armor"
---
"Tribal Armor"
---
Well I'm hoping we'll still have our above ground camps because it adds to the game to see lights and buildings people created while you're wandering the map. A lot of people are expecting it'll be an added area, like a basement door to a separate room. That's only speculation, though, we don't know what it'll end up being like. If everyone's entire camp just becomes some doorway to another area with no structures on the map itself, then turrets would be useless- so would every outdoor decoration, many of the building pieces like walls and roofs. These are all things Bethesda makes money selling in the atom shop so I'm pretty sure we'll still have our exterior camps still, just with an added interior zone.
---
Oh well I did that quest tons of times and I've never seen a single box.
---
1000 years
---
Yes they are :)
---
Why do you need to open your pipboy to heal?
---
It's because people on pc always need to use hacks because they are INFERIOR to the console gang who doesn't need to use hacks to win😜
---
If Ward awkwardly replies with 2 lines of dialogue when you initially talk to him when turning in, back out and try again. If you let him do this, he won't award rep.
---
Same here. I'm also new to this build and I usually run around at somewhere between 40 an 60% radiation. What I love so much about unyielding armor and the low-health build is the flexibility it gives me. Overencumbered? Temporarily lose some health so you can FT to the nearest vendor. Not quite stealthy enough? Same remedy. Plus all the other QoL improvements like more XP, more AP and better condition of found loot.
---
The drawback is that you can suddenly die to stuff you normally would just absorb and shrug off like a random scorched or ghoul attacking you from behind.
---
Definitely more fun than launch now that it has npcs
---
Only problems are bugs and how easy it is to ddos it
---
You didn't miss much by not killing it.  The loot is nothing impressive and it probably would have been a one star lead pipe.
---
The real loot is from the adds.  Bunch of walking, growling screw dispensers lol.
---
Can you just use explosive bait to level their camp?
---
Outside of melee/unarmed the PA arm mods are total shite.
---
Why the heck isn't there some ballistic themed mods? Hell, I'd take a measly +5% vats hit mod over rusty knuckles, or shielded plating for even higher protection etc. I get this is what you're saying by backpack mods but it needs a dedicated line.
---
Give some love to PA!
---
Jetpack is dogshit. Always run Protocols.
---
Corret me if I am wrong, but items are duped. Gold bullions dont even exist as item in your inventory, just like caps.
---
At the very fuckin least Bethesda could set up a fucking warning if you are about to send gold bullions into the void because you are reaching the limit.
---
I like rad emitters but i dont know if those work anymore
---
They are “magic effects” since there’s no rational reason for legendary characteristics to be applied to anything; they are almost exclusively unrealistic enchantments, any way you look at it. It isn’t the bugs or even the OP combinations that have been exploited to hell and back - it’s legendary effects, in general, that are magic.
---
I don't see the satisfaction of killing the SBQ in 40 seconds.  I sent two nukes off back to back yesterday, the first one we finished with almost 20 minutes left but the second one we finished with just 15 seconds on the clock and that was great because at the end everyone is sending emojies in disbelief.    At level 312 I still enjoy the fight.
---
Dude. Have you not explored the customization menu or something? You can make your character large AND bald bruh. I've seen tons of people do it
---
Yes! I'm an in game hoarder and I want my base to reflect that.
---
biv has hiv
---
Sorta. Its value will go back up if you wait a bit and hope dupers dont get a new strategy
---
Scrip or display
---
Congrats buddy! That rifle of yours does crazy damage for not being primed lol. Shame it didn’t clear the challenge though. How much ammo did you use?
---
PRESENTS
---
Wat?
---
LOL!   I can appreciate that viewpoint.
---
I think they're interesting, but let's put it this way.   I don't waste time in camps unless they grab me pretty much immediately visually.
---
We do, it's just garbage
---
We're just balancing the playing field since console comes preinstalled with aimbot 😜
---
How did you find a building you could build on top of? Trial and error? Is there something you look for in a building that would allow this to be built?
---
I love terminals in Fallout, so I'm a bit biased. But here's my opinion if I strip away that bias. The Ammo Converter is really just an ammo trashcan for the garbage ammo that other players don't often buy from you. The ammo trashcan a bit like the Fallout 1st Scrapbox. Nobody really wants the Scrapbox. What they really want is an almost bottomless Stashbox. And players don't want an ammo trashcan. What they really want is to be able to sell their ammo to NPC vendors just like in other Fallout games. It's like getting excited for a vaccine. It's better not to have the disease in the first place. We already have a caps limit. We should just be able to sell ammo to the in-game vendors.
---
B25250 is better.
---
Magic effects don't work with Furious, otherwise Bash is better
---
u should remove everything else of ur camp and just have several stacks of firepits everywhere
---
Uh, no. Legendary effects are not magic effects. They are Legendary effects.
---
Also, what is referred to as “magic” effects are certain ones like 50% LD, which deal tremendous damage if your weapon has a very high fire rate (LMG and Minigun for example).
---
You only need one effect! You got something with one of these?
---
1 star vamp flamer and troubleshooter armor is the easy way and maybe 50% health if not max
---
You could maybe with a vamp fixer or handmade but I lose myself on the reloads
---
I feel you. I've unsuccessfully been farming for the Red Asylum outfit for 7 months now, and I've (temporarily?) given up. The grind against 1:10000 odds is just too soul-crushing and mind-numbing.
---
Cause when I use the stimpack button (Right on the Dpad on PS4 I think?) it does the animation for each stimpack I use where I stab it in my chest, making it very hard to spam stims with the little hot key button in intense moments. But if I spam the stimpack button in the stats menu and I can use several at once and only do the stimpack animation once when I exit the pipboy. 
---
Don’t think it mattered though with the imposter Sheepsquach... She kinda just obliterates me regardless of how many stims I spam.
---
That's actually incorrect. There's a very slight aim ASSIST on console but not aimbot. Aimbot is when you autolock to someone's head like pc aimbot is, console aim assist simply slightly guides you towards the person if your reticle is close to them. It does not make you go to their head. You'd know if you actually played Xbox or PS4
---
All events in the Savage Divide have a 0.15% chance to drop it.
---
But I guess pc is clueless how console works. But we know all about your guys bs
---
Then play a game that doesnt suck
---
Toot toot!
---
This
---
Treasury Notes were able to be duplicated, and were in huge amounts. So including Smiley, that would be a stockpile of roughly 17,200 gold bullion in 90 days for a duper, and it would require zero effort.
---
Imagine if a duper took a gamble and did this on three characters for 6 months using duped Treasury Notes and Handmade Presents. That's about 100k gold bullion stockpiles. This ruins any and all possibility of *ever* adding tradeable items of any kind that could be purchased with gold bullion. In-game equivalent of hyper-inflation. They just added Gold Bullion under the premise of "starting a new economy" like the Federal Reserve, and surely this is a long-term idea that will last into future content.
---
Now with a capped limit, they limit the damages.  Now *and* into the future. Do you see where I'm coming from?
---
thanks guys, hopefully i'll get the atoms in a day or two.
---
Honestly I’m not quite sure... I think I had 7000 556 earlier today, I didn’t check it after the fight sadly... I kinda just had to walk away after the fight my blood was pumping so much ha ha 
---
(I’ll check tomorrow morning when I get back on though.)
---
TSE weapons are SHIT, i dont understand why people think they are good
---
I think the amount of scrip from the machine needs to go to at least 300. I save up my modules and roll like 20 at a time. Also it’s stupid that all my hard work and farming leads to a chance for 1-3 star gear. I can handle not getting the effects I want when I roll, but damn man...also we need to be able to put this stuff in the vendor and sell to other players.
---
They do work, but it doesn't show in the damage floaters (which are buggy in various other ways as well).
---
Unyielding gives you 3 points on each special Stat excluding endurance. So no its not even close. You are looking for either vanguard or bolstering with either sentinel or cavalier.
---
Well, no. More a tangential thing. 15 more each special but E is hella handy for sneaking, crits, etc.
---
You are more squishy for sure.
---
Better comparison would be Serendipity.
---
I prefer numbers to "shredding","melting" and whatnot. Do you mean you killed her in 10 shots?100?1000?
---
Spawn points will never come back because of trappers... its a pretty PC wasteland. Anything else that resembles a mechanic we have or introduces a new one will cost you at least 500 atoms but most likely itd be 1200 because what you want is an exclusive in a bundle. So no thankyou to all of your ideas
---
Yea thinking the same thing, would be the perfect opportunity to introduce legendary PA pieces. Brotherhood of steel and all their hoarding of advanced tech.... would make sense right?
---
I was half tempted to acquire a full set of troubleshooters armor specifically for trying to solo Encryptid, which armor would be the best for a troubleshooters set? Heavy Robot?
---
If you ever need help with higher end content with high level mobs let me know. I'm level 300 and will be happy to help. My IGN: vexenonify
---
are you actually so salty about secret service armor being better than PA that you gotta call it nazi armor?
---
This was an issue during Fastnacht for me too, the legendary sloth wasn't insanely good drops but it's at least LS, however due to it being pretty weak people could and often would just demolition it's HP bar before you could get a hit because it's spawn was between a few spots. There should be more analysis on each event, if the legendary monster is losing HP too quickly the requirements for getting the loot should be dropped. One player or two players shouldn't be able to render everyone else ineligible for rewards because they own a ridiculous Gat Plas or Guass Mini that melts HP bars.
---
Guess some folks have co-opted it when I wasn’t looking, since at least a dozen YT channels and roughly a quarter of the players I’ve interacted with since the Beta have been referring to them as such (if not “enchantments”) since before 3* was common. So someone’s using it to refer to some of the particularly broken effects, now? *shrug* 
---
Sorry for my misunderstanding then.
---
You would need 4 Pieces og sentinel armor to get a statistical chance for 45% DR, but that only Works when you are standing Up and not moving. EP on PA is in a league of it's own..
---
What plans did you buy and read?
---
&gt; I can kill her as fast as I want.
---
There are lots of things you can do, some of which are considerate of others and some that clearly are not.   Killing the the SBQ in 40 seconds is the in game equivalent of letting a monstrous fart rip at Thanksgiving dinner while sitting next to Grandma.  Don't be the guy that farts while sitting next to Granny.
---
Don't even notice the negatives from speed demon and i don't use any points in class freak
---
Got it. Seems perfect to have 200 simple hp recipes and no poison resist ones,which is far more useful.
---
I don't remember needing a mod for this in FO4. You could literally place almost anything anywhere. Even pickup and move bodies. I can see why they didn't add this, loading camps would be a nightmare. But I really wish we could move and place found objects.
---
You are still instructing people to not get mad and post on here. You are upset at seeing these posts. So you are being passive/aggressive and asking and telling them not to.
---
Those damn things are pretty scary I’ve been laid low by more than one and respawn and gone.
---
Yes you can have both marsupial and speed demon at the same time, you can run all the mutations at once if you wish. As for the downsides with max class freak I don't notice any at all.
---
Yup, seems dumb we can have a pool table but not the accessories that go with it.
---
Man. Negative Nancy over here. It would be simple enough to make the spawn points only for you and your team. And though I agree with you that they would be inclined to sell it back to us, you don't want anyone to even have the option to have any of these just because you don't want to pay for it?
---
Just nerf the broken builds easy fix
---
Getting the 20 treasury notes is not difficult at all. I mean I see what you are trying to say, but such a dupe would only take the effort of earning the treasury notes away, which is a very small effort. Also there are already, and will be players who will max out their daily allotment of gold bullions on their chars.
---
&gt;Like.. if there are 2 scrip left and I try to trade in a 1-star legendary armor piece for 3 scrip, the game literally will not let me. But with gold, you can
---
This sums up Bethesda. Trying to limit the player in every possible way.
---
Got a free Santa one way back in the day
---
bow explosive and ultracite arrows from ae-ri, they are still listed as not learned
---
Honestly if said person who launched the nuke proceeds to melt her then who is anyone else to complain, They can obviously solo it, you're just tagging along to the free ride. I guess beggars can be choosers.
---
Yes bro, but can't make head big and big stomach. Try and you will see.
---
Yea All those CS noobs with their Mouse and keyboard are No match for the leet powa of your controlla! I hear ya bro...
---
Unfortunately no
---
This was the first paid only item they had added in
---
True, they should give more options. I want body tattoos and body scar. War paint like they had in Skyrim would be cool.
---
you can have like 17 mutations on you, they work seperatly. the hunger and thirst doesnt really matter, i recommend getting carnivore also. with that,  you can eat every raw meat to silence the hunger, get hp and there is no chance for diseases. and raw meat is something, you get at every corner.  
---
angryturtle just made [a video about every single mutation](https://youtu.be/tTsMkWVKB0A) thats up to date and really informative.
---
Ok thank :) nice to know now
---
Plenty of enemies to clear, I'm not sure about the level though? Do they jump up to the typical glowing variants levels or do they remain a relatively low level? assuming the stay pretty low level it will also be extremely fast.
---
You get lots of loading screens in this game, every building with instanced areas, which is lots, every time you fast travel etc. 
---
You need to embrace the loading screens if you're gonna play for any length of time.
---
did you try a server change? perhaps its some kind of laggy. personally, i never had that issue.
---
How about general health boost. To counter poison/fire/AP rounds
---
This will only treat a symptom of a problem, but not the actual problem. Realistically, you can’t expect people to pay for a server so that some *other* people get loot. The real problem is that you can end up without the loot in the first place and that is beyond regular players
---
You do have a few days to grind for atoms to get the scav bot, the themed ones don’t just get junk they can be programmed to get special stuff 
---
Like my faschnat scavenger bot gets drinks :)
---
Supposedly some of the magic weapon stuff is being addressed on the PTS but I have no idea what that means, what effects have been addressed or what the timeline is for it going live in the real servers.
---
Worst case scenario is that you have a god mode weapon....until tomorrow when patch 20 releases.
---
maybe you bought and learned the plans for the compound bow instead of the regular bow?
---
That Orgasm will probably only last until everyone ammo runs out. then I suspect that after that people will be back to occasional scrounging lead or checking for sales, Then people will have space for the plans and the price on some of thoes will creep up since less Caps spent on Ammo.
---
Didn’t even think of using carnivore that’s brilliant
---
Perfect thanks!
---
Have you tried using the face scuplt feature?
---
I find in places a turret would look good, you can use a spotlight turret. It doesn’t take the same budget
---
I don't think class free works on speed demon unfortunately. Though it's down sides are not huge anyway
---
Idk how simple that would be im no coder. But yeah pretty much. It sickens me that they sell us new mechanics without giving us basic free versions of things. The atomic shop was supposed to be for cosmetics and utility items like the little kits. They didnt "make enough" doing that so now they sell us shit like refrigerators and collectrons when theres no way to acces that in the base game. Soon theyll start cranking out the skyscrapper bundle complete with elevators, robotic atendents and a whitesprings texture pack for only 2800 atoms. No thankyou. Thats wrong in my eyes, sorry if you cant see that but thats my opinion.
---
I have already left the game. Its been two months. It's mainly because of the fallout 1st exclusives that should have been in game like the tent and the scrapbox and private worlds.
---
Some quests are impossible to complete without private worlds which forces you to pay if you wanna do all the missions available. And the scrapbox is just something that should have been in the game since the start, it doesn't affect performance, it doesn't affect characters but it does affect how much you can enjoy the game before hitting a limiting wall.
---
Just commenting because I wanna give your props for these ideas. The armor sets you have add a great boost without completely unbalancing it
---
Hell yeah, praise the Lord on that one
---
That's what I was going to say
---
My guess is that more items will be released only purchasable with bullion, if some players have 100k saved up and are able to buy everything straight away it would throw off the balance between those who didn't have any saved.
---
Play the game for at least 5-10 hours once you log in after tuesday over any number of days for the next 10 weeks, , and odds are you will be able to open up the game board that will show up  and pick it up
---
I just want to make cold drinks using cryo cells+drink
---
You could get the reflect or block one
---
Don't assume anything with fo76 .)
---
Take "load bareing" for example, all you need to do is to press the button and then stand right inside the mine for the duration of the "event". You don't need to defend the mines, let alone repair them.
---
Serendipity is the sub for emergency protocols. 50% chance to avoid damage or something like that
---
Hmm you like Free States hey? ;)
---
Took me a while to figure out you can fast travel from indoors. That’s definitely enough for me.
---
I have a One X and Google Fiber, but my friend that lives in a hotel loads in before me everytime. Makes no sense.
---
Everyone would do foundation with the stash buff, even if it’s an odd number like that. An extra 160lbs of stash weight would be incredible
---
Game board? On regular open world, right? Not the arena or whatever?
---
Nope. As I understand it, it's a side effect from Bethesda's previous attempts to fix the Furious effect. There is a script now that tries to bundle up various legendary effects instead of each having its own little control script running, but the new script is bugged and effectively now gives all those legendary effects a buggy, unfettered version of the Furious effect.
---
Its just a year or so too late
---
Im still using a level 25 shotgun to one shot anything thats not legendary and over 55... or a bat.
---
With unyielding nothing will see you in the first place.
---
You obviously need to play the game less. And your missing my point you probably built into those. Most people arent smart enough to do that. They eith copy and paste a bloodied build or fumble around with crap until it it sorta works for them Nd even then those people arent 1shotting anything
---
Haha, thank you! Finally, a way to shut him up, god bless you good man.
---
I dont find it too annoying. There is supposed to be changes coming in the way food works in the game anyway and you will no longer get negative effects from not eating, only the buffs from eating. Once you use Speed Demon you will never want to go back. Its quite jarring how much slower and sluggissh you feel without it
---
Yes, that happens sometimes.
---
I recall that the Death Claw and Cat topiary had the same problem.  They were bugged so that everyone could build them even before they dropped in the Atomic Shop.
---
They have since fixed that.
---
My understanding was that if you had already built them they were not deleted but you lost access to building new ones if you didn’t purchase them in the Atomic Shop.
---
That’s what I figured, the last SBQ I killed must have taken 20 minutes. There were plenty of people there too, but most all of them was on top a tent, just wasting ammo. Is aggro based off whoever is doing the most DPS?  It’s seemed a bit random to me.
---
I don't notice the hunger, but I do notice the additional thirst. Having a CAMP with a bunch of water purifiers, though, means it's just a minor hassle instead of an actual problem.
---
Something like the OCDecorator and Creative Clutter mods for FO4 would be amazing, in my opinion. Take my atoms!
---
I love the smell of Atoms in the morning
---
I’ve never joined an SBQ fight where it’s taken less than 10 minutes to kill her. Am I just lucky? (PC)
---
I found this location in youtube video 🤣
---
So sometime ago a bunch of smaller youtubers did a bunch of shitty exposes on Oxhorn where they talked about an old blog of hia where he talked about some of his political views, some of which were very controversial. I'm not really into cancelling people for their views and Oxhorn made a video adressing the fact later on and claiming he had changed, so I don't see a problem here.
---
What I do see as a problem was that he did not talk about how he went around claiming some of these videos for copyright abuse to silence the criticism before he had to talk about on video, going so far as placing three strikes on a channel at once, causing it to be deleated.
---
Most of those smaller youtubers were Fallout-related and frankly their videos were quite shite, which does not forgive copyright abuse. If you want an in-depth and inpartial look into this topic check out the Right Opinion's video on him, he is a very well-spoken commentary channel and he has never played Fallout, so his sole focus is how Oxhorn handled the situation and not how he handles lore.
---
YES, logic gates please!! my puzzle camps would be soo much better. Running out of ideas
---
I think language is too important to mess with, and content creators should be extra allowed to express themselves creatively...
---
PvP is at a an all time low, this game has the worst PvP I’ve ever played. There are so many exploits/ glitches that make the overall PvP experience dreadful. I hate glitched weapons, I hate jet packs and I hate god mode glitch(dust-pile glitch for all you veterans). I really hope one day they’ll release a patch that would fix all these problems and make the PvP community happy, but I know that won’t happen, it’s like chasing the dragon at this point. This game is so full of bugs that the PvP community is the least of their worries. I’m gonna go drink me some vintage nukashine now and wake up in someone’s basement. Deuces ✌🏼
---
that perk is my favorite after two-shot
---
You can with base FO4, but the mod makes it static so it doesn't get knocked over / bug out when loading and it's easier to place it exactly where you want from the workshop.
---
Been thinking about this for a while because I run a shotgun/explosives build and had always thought about junkies but I didn't realise that addictions are permanent. My shotgun build is already about as nuts as a typical shotgun build with insane damage but if I could get ahold of a junkies Double Barrel with explosive shots that could be insane.
---
Yes to both questions.
---
I wouldn't mind a system like this but based on the example you showed here I would go for neutral.
---
I wholeheartedly agree that it's wrong, but they obviously aren't going to stop doing it. People continue to purchase these things, lest they would have no reason to crank them out. So if they're going to keep up the microtransaction filth, I would rather them spend the time working on an actual mechanic I can buy rather than some new skins for 15 bucks.
---
Or we can continue as we are. No new mechanics. Still abundant microtransactions.
---
If it's going to continue either way, if it comes down to either having to pay for these features or not have them at all, I think it's preferable to at least have the option to pay for them.
---
Wanderer is my favorite.  Sophia is the runner up.
---
Gramps is okay.
---
Radio Punk is an interesting choice but not usually one I choose to have active.
---
Beckett is bugged for me and won’t give me his daily quests after completing his main quest line.
---
Yes, I tried. Have you tried to make larger, bigger head?
---
My BoS under armour gives me +2 strength. My PA gives me +1 strength. So I can carry more and hit harder when I get out of my fusion powered robot suite. Not to even mention the backpack. Why wouldn't BoS under armour which is designed for PA not work with PA? 
---
I can build a fusion generator surely I can add a piece of sting to my backpack and tie it to my PA, weld on a powerfist or even an assaultron blade. Stick the SS jetpack on so I don't use fusion cores.
---
Ah, good to know, that is very helpful. Thanks
---
why is that?
---
If you're still looking for the plans, I'm on PC, and pretty sure I have a few of those sitting about. Let me know if you want one :)
---
Depends on the building. And yes sometimes but it is 100x quicker than FO4. Takes less than 10 seconds usually for me.
---
I think it’s an awesome idea! You’ve clearly put a lot of time and thought into this and possibly with a few minor tweaks suggested by this community Bethesda could make this work! You practically give them a good foundation to work from.... should they listen up and introduce faction affiliations😀😀😀
---
https://youtu.be/k6BpOYO8pjY
---
Great guide on places to find the 3 random allies.
---
I followed the guide a couple of nights back and found 2 of the three (Wanderer and Radio Punk) on my first two stops.
---
How committed are you to a Junkied build? That would be the big difference, don't you think?
---
Thk, let's hope this happens.
---
Junkies. It's a straight 50% boost. Aa also dosent work properly on energy weapons. It goes off the base number. Not the number after perks so you gain a tiny amount of damage
---
Can you craft those items?
---
I’ve noticed there are there are few plans that do not list as (Known) when i revisit the vendor - mainy some of the PA mods.
---
Thanks)
---
Yeah, like immunity to poison and disease with all 6 pieces equipped
---
Pretty sure these people just do it to ruin it for everybody.
---
“I would love to pay real money for ported Fallout 4 items that should’ve been free to begin with”
---
Because people do it on private servers. No point in doing it on public, there is always some rando effing it up. Starting the event too soon, AFK-ing, simply not knowing what to do, ...
---
While I do not like the situation, it is how it is. We have a close to 100% succes rate on private server while on public this is many times lower. So why bother?
---
Radiation rumble and encryptid also have this problem but to a lesser extent. But also for those, we prefer private.  
---
As long as BGS doesn't give the noobs more info on the event IN GAME, I do not see this changing, especially because many of us already have the plans.
---
That looks pretty fun!
---
No 🤣 it is fun to call it that
---
Very nice!
---
Thats very pragmatic and whats guna keep happ3ning. I dont expect it to change. But my perfect world scenario would be to add stuff like that in as a progressive reward like for bullion or new events rewards. Something where i can be rewarded with something new and usefull for just playing the game. I dont want them to try and compel me to spend just to keep new content coming.
---
and soon with the Ammo converter you will probably need less ammo from lead farming.
---
No one, just you. 🙄
---
I kinda wish they'd take a different tack with Power Armor and go more of a science + engineering route of using lots of mods instead of just adding legendary effects.  In FO4 you could add various coatings to reduce either energy damage, or explosive, etc.
---
Make us able to rework the arm(s) into full-on melee weapons, like a huge hammer or blade but at the cost of not being able to wield any other weapons until we swap it out at a power armor station.  There's clearly mods that try to up PA unarmed damage but they're garbage right now compared to real weps.
---
Maybe an arm / torso mod that connects wires from our suit to energy weapons to up their damage by shunting some of our suits fusion core energy into them.
---
They need to change something about the frames
---
Good call, i invested and now im considering doin unyielding armor just to get my special back
---
the reason is because bethesda tried to update the "furious" legendary effect and now any weapon with a high fire rate will start a damage cascade similar to furious in addition to all its other legendary effects. the effect happens on all enemies, not just the sbq.
---
I don't think it shows anything accurately. For one thing we know that there were more than 2 or 3 bombs dropped on the U.S. which is what the globe shows
---
It's not just the builds that are the problem. You can have zero combat perk cards and produce similar results.
---
Hold up. Serendipity dont work while in  PA?
---
So you'd be addicted to everything in the book and vastly irradiated.... You're living the wasteland dream my friend.
---
Breaking that down, though. They say lower levels take an hour, so let’s generously assume levels are low until lvl 50. The next 49 lvls will take ‘around’ two hours, so again let’s be generous and mark a quarter of those down as an hour and a half. You’re still looking at around...143 hours? You’d need a lot of atoms to take the sting out of that grind.
---
Backpacks are untradable, but you can get a small one for free from the overseer's cache in Morgantown airport
---
The quest to make the normal one is started at train stations, read the pioneer scouts poster :)
---
You do the main quest in Morgantown Airport.
---
Honestly,  I think bonus sets are the way to go
---
Me and a friend tested out the so called “exploit” of being able to access someone’s stash as soon as they load in. We tried this but what we discovered is that the vendor will completely clear out as soon as you do this, and the vendor will display as either empty or you will get the error saying the vendor is busy or something like that.. For the owner of the vendor, the things will display as being in the vendor with the “price tag” displayed next to the items ( when looking at the items trough the stash box)  even tho there is nothing in the vendor, and then the owner of the vendor will not be able to access their vendor. The owner of the vendor will have to log out and log back in again to be able to assign items to the vendor again. ( The vendors will  be empty, and all of the items that was in their vendor will be in their stash without the “price tag”).
---
Or well this is what we did to see if that exploit is real or not.
---
Oh sorry. Thanks for that
---
Min constantly acts like shes on speed and like standing in my foundations.
---
I've got a better question. why bother going out and clearing out monsters from the wasteland when all the new rewards are from staying at home with murmurgh and crafting it yourself? I hate the new SS armor, not because of the stats, but because it doesnt feel like im getting a fun reward for my effort. my old armor was hard earned, through hours of farming and trading. but the new SS armor is just a dice roll, so unsatisfying to just make something in my basement and somehow its "legendary". in my head, legendary items only come from legendary monsters. I hate the new system for loot.
---
Is it a long quest lineV
---
Try to mod your bow for the respective plans. The arrow types are configured as bow mods, not ammo that can be made.
---
Low damage, heavy ammo and low durability - Whats underrated about that?
---
That bow merchant is a random settler encounter. I first ran across her at the unmarked campsite near Wayward. Her % must be stupid high because months later and still not ran into her again.
---
Wanderer has given me a quest every 3 days.oddly the others hadent been.
---
Problem is all charactees are the same (no classes like other mmo) and can solo anything.  All events give scrip already and no one groups cause there is no bonus.  Patch 20 will change that I hope.
---
Because of year and a half old YouTube videos from when it actually was top tier stuff.
---
Turn the game off and back on. If it keeps doing it turn the game off again and back on.
---
To be honest,  only the strongest weapons and armor are crafted from the purvayor , I mean I get the frustration but I didn't make this change,  so take it up with Bethesda,  not me.
---
I love that 90rw
---
You are missing the point. You want nerfs on bloodied because you personally don't like to play with one, even when bloodied has nothing to do with the problems you described. GG.
---
Unfortunately it is a pretty long one yeah
---
The Pioneer Scouts quest is also weird compared to most of them
---
You have to complete a bunch of challenges and stuff, like earning badges just like the real scouts
---
So the length of time it takes to do kind of varies
---
You can see your progress on Tadpole and Possum Challenges when you get them in the "world" section of the challenges menu :)
---
I wouldn't be surprised if there was a daily cap on the amount of ammo you can convert.
---
kind of funny that someone who describes themselves as a fallout top-tier dealer needs a backpack plan
---
Look man this is cool and all but you shouldn’t be labeling factions as evil neutral or good, all of that shit is subjective. It’s what pissed me off about fallout 3 the fact that it labeled things as evil that aren’t to some and good as things some people wouldn’t consider. Not everyone thinks the enclave or the crater raiders are evil. Just because the raiders have a harsh way of getting by does not make them evil, also worshipping some moth creature doesn’t make you a bad group of people, all of this seems to cartoony for fallout but it seems that games are going in this direction sadly.
---
He likes to feel tall.
---
Appreciate the help, but I've been doing that since I made the post lmao. I'll just keep trying
---
Don't even have to do the quest, it's in the overseer's cache, you can just run in and get it.
---
I mostly did trading, not playing.
---
It caters for ultracite too
---
you're the one asking for more armor options, all I want is to find it out in the world instead of crafting it.
---
this. 
---
If Bullion is intended to be the end game currency going forward, having a cap prevents people from buying all new releases day 1
---
Thanks a lot!
---
F
---
This not only happens to me with player vendors, but with in game vendors. I’m required to back out of the server and hopefully cross my fingers that it works the next time I try. It’s soooo frustrating man. Yesterday, I had the most annoying experience with the purveyor. She wasn’t giving me the option to purchase anything.
---
F for a fallen mask
---
It's getting good but still not No Man's Sky's level for sure. Fo76 lack several lethal things such as   
---
1.lack of endgame contents,   
---
2.game modes tied to end-game,   
---
3.limitations forcing player to make micro-management every time,   
---
4.Lack of quality of life improvements,   
---
5.Unbalanced and large useless pile of legendary specs,  
---
6.and lastly there are still many exploits and dupes.   
---
for example,  
---
1. There are only SBQ and Colossal Vendigo fights tied to nuke event.  
---
2. There was Vault raids which was pretty popular and fun, but they removed before wasteland update. Such modes are important for diversity and fun. Such as WoW's mythic dungeons, or Divisions survival or underground modes.  
---
3. 150 daily legendary scrap limit, 1500 daily caps, 800lbs storage. Personally i don't have any problem about storage because i'm not looting anything beside ammo and flux mats. But Fallout essentially a hoarder game which you loot, storage and create. This limit just makes it painful. Daily scrap limit is probably worse getting something good is equal to win a grand lottery, 1500 caps are manageable for endgame players which engages player to player trade.   
---
4. Fo76 is lacking severely in that department. Crappy inventory management, painful perk system which forces you to change manually every. single. time. I personally didn't open a single safe or chest like months, because i'm sick of changing my perks every time. And many of us probably forget their craft setup and waste serious ammo at SBQ fights or daily farms. I downloaded an inventory and perk mod before wastelanders and it provided one button perk change, loadout and many improvements. Honestly that was best days of my fo76.   
---
5. There are only bloodied and maybe junkie works well. But honestly bloodied with unyielding-bolstering is best by far. I have all stats ranged 10-30 and have an armor equal to my full modded x-01 power armor. Plus i got jetpack and backpack. 2-3k damage per bullet is pretty op. But downside is when you're farming you can get over 100-200 different type of weapon armor. You have a chance to roll 1-3 star then you need to roll 1-200 for what weapon you need, then you need to roll a good spec which is bloodied or junkie. Chances are so slim that my friend who played around 2000 hours still farming for a good weapon.   
---
6. It's insane, ranged from a simple dupe to stealing all of your equipment, destroying your camp, broke your server and much more. If you're on private it's okay, but on public it's a nightmare.   
---
Overall, they're still updating the game, loadouts are coming so the new contents. Honestly i'm quite bored and didn't login or renew my subs for a while. Keep in mind, i have full spec-modded  SS armor with perfect bloodied handmade, full reputation and literally bored to death for doing same things over and over again.
---
I can't disagree with any of that. I left the game months ago because of one bug too many. And that was long after I had reached the point where I only played about an hour a day to bang out the dailies to get Atoms for CAMP decor. But I came back to it to give Wastelanders a try at the urging of a friend. 
---
Once I have maxed out reputation with both factions, which should happen by the end of the week, I'll have done everything I want to do with Wastelanders. I *would* have fallen back into the routine of doing dailies and weeklies, but the Seasons thing is stripping away the Atom rewards I was getting for those and replacing them with things I don't care about. The ammo converter and the sink are the only things on that entire rewards list that I am interested in, and I expect to unlock them about the time I max reputations.
---
So I'm looking at leaving under the spirit of having "finished" the game.
---
You have to earn 3 badges and do a few other things.  Some of the badges are harder to complete than others.  If you pick 3 of the easier ones (Archer, athlete, swimmer or hunter) you can get them done pretty quick.  I did 3 of those in about 2 and a half hours one afternoon.
---
For most people the hardest challenge is to revive another player.  If you have any friends who can help its really easy otherwise you just need to hang around events like scorched Earth where a couple people almost always end up getting killed.  The other option is to make a Reddit post, and more than likely someone will volunteer to get killed for you.  I've done it for several people in the past.
---
It's where your camp is located for sure, I got a level 20 VATS Unknown at around level 240 and my camp is located in the forest.
---
On one of my alts, I’ve learnt the plan for the cooking stove, but it’s still locked in the build menu, and tells me to learn the plan.  
---
I re-bought the plan, but can’t learn it because I already know it.  
---
Never had that happen before on any of my other plans or alts, but that one can’t build a cooking stove, and can’t learn it either.
---
No problem :) good luck
---
What are you on? I have a reduced weight ffr mutants minigun that I love to use but cant keep ammo for it. I'll take it off your hands
---
I agree that bullion limit is out of line with prices for purchasable plans. It's artificial wall you can't prevail with money ( like in "free to play" games, or mobile games ), but only with long term dedication. With 200 daily limit it's not even enough for 1 helm plan, or pair of armor limbs with mods after whole week collecting it. Expect month(s) of weekly dedication to buy multiple stuff. In this case, warning on loosing any of such dedication should be mandatory, possible impossible to do, and this is oversight on Bethesda's side...
---
Yeah, DR/ER values that beat a full vanguard set, never having to repair and an inherent 42% damage reduction just isn't enough.
---
In fact, the 78% damage reduction with lone wanderer and protocols isn't enough, better reduce that 22% that does get tested vs resistance by another 30%.
---
Something should be done about poison damage though, right now PA just gets destroyed while one PR effect on regular armor makes poison do nothing.
---
So if I own no other collectrons and I was to buy the communist one I can set it to collect junk? Is that right?
---
Agreed, the "medic" build and "assault" builds etc need bonuses like 20% healing and 20% damage, and the same debuffs for balance. This patch will change a lot. People will no longer be scared to be group ganked. And you will receive a few scrip/bullion rewards over time which is a serious improvement!
---
I know you can get a Legendary weapon to scrip if you're lucky enough to get a hit, but my scrip currency count doesn't increase? And I attend every popular event?
---
Ok so that globe isn't new it was in the game a long time ago as a free atomic shop item, a few months ago mine disappears from the camp building system then as I decide that it dosen't matter any ways they release this bundle... And what's included in the bundle... THE ALREADY FREE GLOBE THAT I HAD BEFORE!
---
You should come come check out our discord we have a wonderful community where we do all kinds of events and other fun things! Just give a hello when you stop by the Enclave!

---
With the release of wastelanders team leaders quests don't show to other people anymore
---
I'm pretty sure it's just a big but I haven't seen any word on them fixing it
---
I loved everything until the last part. Im not trying to play the sims but if they make it to where i dont need to shovel dog food down over and over every couple minutes that would be Mazing
---
I had to server hop a couple times to get it to work. I have a video. Just trying to upload!
---
It's not decentivizing it. The incentive is still there, that is the bonuses you get for consuming food. They're merely removing a bit of tedium from the game, and I'm looking forward to it.
---
judging by the roadmap, expect some form of 'companion' in Winter. God only knows what the hell that means, but here's hoping it's actually a pet system where you raise and take care of your critter/robot depending on how high your Charisma and Intelligence are.
---
All they needed to do was make it drain slower.  Also I should not have to eat 5 steaks to to fill it.
---
It's Bethesda ongoing quest to casualise their game more and more to the point that it's now a shade of its former, more involved and more complex self.
---
Don't get me wrong. I don't view the past with rose tinted glasses. A lot has improved since the old days. Also a lot has been dumbed down and simplified in the name of "streamlining" and going for a more "mainstream" audience, rather than just focus on a good product and have that be the draw to your game.
---
I did suggest to get the pieces from the purvayor, but you still need scrip to get all the stuff anyways which comes from killing and looting .
---
Maybe they should make rare components or plans that can obtained from high end game missions so you can't just craft everything with simple materials.  The strangler heart plans was obtained from high end vault raids, sure you had craft it.
---
You're not going to have lost your character and stuff, all that is stored server side
---
It's just some kind of glitch, should be fine if you give it some time, worst case scenario probably reinstall the game
---
I don't like most of the trap houses, but I kind of want to see that one.
---
You gave a guy Excavator PA in front of Riverside Manor?    
---
If this was about a year ago ... maybe I misremembered the level and was just in awe ;)
---
I'm not a diehard fan of everything oldschool either, but Bethesda has a weird habit of not recognizing their strengths and doubling down on things that they've proven to be pretty bad at.
---
So without perks they total 1.2k in weight?
---
If that's the case then they damn well better add some new ways to get gold, or increase the daily cap, cause 4-5 weeks to get a new armor set is an abysmal grind that puts even games like destiny to shame
---
My GT is TODD#6521
---
They will probably just have a Vertibird or two.
---
I bought the kitchen stove once, not realising it wasn't the same thing at the time...
---
Dr er has diminished results and you can get upto 900+ dr with a fully parked bolstering/vanguard set with secret service armor. 
---
Full set of secret service with buttressed , barbarian, iron clad, junk shield , evasive, nerd rage and the back pack mod that gives 90 dr ( don't know the name) 
---
And on top of that , you get a unique Legendary perk which reduces ranged damage by 30% and no damage taken perks like serendipity
---
I think you’re overstating it a bit, but in general I agree. Maybe some other metric besides food and evil would be more appropriate. Regardless, I like the general idea of it all.
---
I love survival games, but following this sub have made me realize that FO76 does not have a large survival liking fanbase. It's playerbase likes looters and don't want eating or drinking to disturb their grind or shooting. Even this way it seems too much for them, and the way it is now doesn't really disturb anything.
---
This is ashame, but I can understan this, because I am a looter fan too and wouldn't want any survival elements to The Division 2 for example. I like those elements in FO76 thou.
---
Based
---
&gt;Foundation Good
---
No. Foundation are exceptionally selfish, nasty colonials. Sneering Imperialists if you will.
---
Probably an option on the main menu screen, above or just below the atom shop. the bard is realy just a way to track what rank you have in the season.
---
This right here. I unlocked the Kitchen Stove and tried building the Cooking Stove. Took me like 3 days to figure out why I couldn't build it.
---
I've took a break because of this. I can hit the daily gold bullion and daily caps in 2 hours at most. I've been going on to do daily but Ive even stopped that now. They should honestly increase all the caps massively. I literally have no reason to play atm.
---
I just want some true end game challenge haha. I'd love something like diabolo 3s rift system. Just waves of hard enemy's and a boss until its so hard you can't complete it anymore
---
Agreed. To me, all they should've done was lower the rate of thirst hunger, allow class freak to affect the negative side effects of speed demon, allowing stacking of perishables in the cooler/fridges, and up the rate on fridges/coolers so they're equal to the perk and allow you to sell items out of the fridge/cooler or add a new vendor that acts as a cooler and can be sold from.
---
100 % disease and poison resistance.
---
cavalier and sentinel. If non PA users can get non-headshots to do 0 damage, this should also be possible with PA.
---
small critters do 0 damage. How can a radrat chew through this thick plating? Makes no sense. At least go with 0 disease chance.
---
I have an Instigating Explosive Lever, superb!
---
They'll arrive via Motherlode.
---
It affects their state of mind while gaming, so I would count it as influence in such a way. But I have no qualm with you seeing that otherwise.
---
My Instigating Explosive Lever is superb!
---
Reinstall bro. That happened to me on PC, I reinstalled it and all back to normal.
---
I thought they had set quests once you do them, there are no more.
---
Beckett was my favorite, he stopped giving quests too. I moved onto another ally for now but when i go to a camp and see him, i stop and interact. Will bring him back tho.
---
The community in this game is amazing, it really did help through quarantine.
---
I generally agree but crater an mothman cultists attack on sight before you start wastelanders. I’d argue that’s a way to define bad guys. Only extreme people would argue that the Enclave isn’t evil. I have a bigger problem with defining vault 76 as good. That implies somehow that Vault-Tec is in some small part actually good. Responders, yes. Vault 76 neutral at best.
---
Even Foundation is questionable as an actually good faction.
---
On drop on public so I can make sales on vendor. 
---
Usually I’ll play nice and let people tag enough, but if they keep staggering it and prevent it from landing, magic weapons comes out and its melt time.
---
I'm relatively new and the three times I did that event I didn't even know there was a sloth until I read it on reddit
---
As an old MMO player, 4-5 weeks is nothing, getting your epic set in EQ could easily take 4-5 months
---
They should alow you to craft PA using a legendary module so you can get legendary effects. I don't use pa because it's better having legendary armour
---
Melee has been bugged since like forever.  So often I'll get a hit marker and see damage numbers pop up but absolutely nothing happens.
---
It's been going on for so long at this point that they either cannot fix it or don't care to.   It's quite shocking when you think about it.
---
Man that would be so wicked! We need enough enemies (ranged/melee) so everybody has a tough time. It's too easy to camp, and take zero damage from the hardest event in the game. A few extra Mirelurk kings here and there would solve that problem :)
---
I get that my post might not give that impression, but I actually don't like true survival games. I don't like micromanaging things and such. I just fear that they're further trying to push FO76 into a market of looter shooters where they're far outmatched by the other games available there. Although I personally would prefer Fallout 76 to be as close to a Fallout 3 or 4 experience as possible, I don't necessarily demand that it should be. I get that it's an attempt to try something else with the franchise. But having that Fallout flavour really is the game's only chance to provide something that competitors can't or won't. I get the impression that Bethesda themselves don't really know what they want FO76 to be.
---
Ay, that's not a bad idea
---
Monster Hunter has an amazing Food system. I demand SuperMutant Cats to make me a cashew butter and blackberry jelly sandwich!

Which legendary perk
---
Your the FROG KING!!!! Count me in
---
In b4 you realize that 99% of this game is tedium.  If you don't tedium I cannot possibly fathom how you can enjoy this game in the absolute slightest.
---
Remove all of the tedium and we will be left with a shell of a game.
---
I don't think AA is worth it on heavy weapons when you've got that AA perk equipped.

I'm pretty sure they will be on foot, the unit coming to Appalachia has been out of contact for three months and should be arriving at ATLAS Observatory soon

I have to imagine it would be much shorter journey if they had vertibirds or other vehicles

Every single MORPG game gets dumbed down eventually and loses some of its flavor over time in order to cater to the lowest possible denomination of gamer.

Yes join me bröthêr Pšñ Priest1503 put in the friend request frog

I contacted Bethesda support as that seemed to get it fixed for someone it happened to last year, apparently it's a rare glitch that was fixed with patch 9.5 but still happens from time.
---
I'm currently reinstalling hopefully it fixes it

I don't even like the gameplay of Monster Hunter, but I considered buying World just because of those cats.

Hope so :) good luck

Fuck! I really feel your pain. I spent more than 6 months doing all those fucken events that are supposed to have a 0.01% drop chance.
---
The problem is that there is no end game progression content for groups like ESO.   Yes this game needs more content for groups.  It's hilarious to me we are getting an LFG tool before we are getting any content that we actually need it for.
---
Yep kinda questioning deleting the game after this shitshow
---
Tbh, that alone would have such a major impact on people's issues with the system that I have absolutely no clue why they don't just do it, especially considering how it would just require a few hours of a single dev's time, at most.
---
God mode is absurd with melee builds. Once you’re in god mode you can have 100 strength which affects your melee damage. Combine that with the fact that you can stack melee bobble heads and chems like fury. That’s how you get people hitting the queen for like 60,000 damage in one hit.
---
I completely agree, and if it seemed like that was a possibility, I'd be putting all my energy into doing whatever I could to make sure they knew that's what we wanted. Unfortunately, it is highly unlikely they will do that. So, you know. You go to war with the army you have, you know?
---
-Drains should be slower
---
-freezer should freeze for at least 80%(it's a money item ffs,the backpack is better!)
---
-the 15 items in the freezer should be stackables.
---
-freezer items should not use budget. I understand magazine and bobbleheads as they are actually displayed(hence using graphic power and some it blabla),but food using budget is only a disadvantage since it is not displayed.
---
yeah but vault 76 is lead by the overseer who is just trying to inoculate people, stop nukes and rebuild stuff.
---
maybe the phrase should have been 'relatively good'
---
B3325 Handmade and Fixer. Nothing else comes even close.
---
I doubt it considering the motherload can't hold people at all
---
I am gonna guess none of you played games in the 80s or 90s. When it could take 30 minutes to load your game. Every time you wanted to play. And then it could crash. or when you'd play a football management sim and after every game it took 3-5 minutes to calculate everything and you just had to like.. sit there. 
---
it's like 3 seconds or something to load an interior.
---
Not to mention that the brotherhood didn't even start building any airships yet until much later
---
What they need to do is let you flag what you intend to eat and drink and then have the character automatically consume it instead of having to manually do it.
---
Plus some caps have massive drawbacks.
---
I don't buy guns from the rusty pick because I can't sell them back fast enough.
---
I don't buy anything from the traders and vending machines because they don't trade back all of what I spent.
---
I don't even bother with gold bullion because why the fuck should I, it's all just a massive waste of resources if I don't get something good, and even then the meta is too important in this damn game to accept anything less than near perfection.
---
We really do, add height, WAY more hair styles, muscle mass, etc. everyone looks the same
---
Same
---
To further respond to your comment, I think it's important to understand what somebody means with "mainstreamlining". In the sense of making the game more accessible, it's a definite plus. I don't know if Fallout 4's increased focus on weapons and shooting was a deliberate attempt to reach FPS audiences, but it's something that the game definitely needed, because going back to Fallout 3's shooting now feels terrible.   
---
If however it boils down to trying to appeal to everyone but not really fully satisfying anyone, you're just setting yourself up for failure, because every audience will have a better alternative to get what they want out of a game.
---
Hmmm.  It can hold one person.  Shhhhhh.  Spoiler
---
You will, don't worry about it.
---
Nope. The start of the very slippery slope to P2W
---
Wait that's gonna be a thing? Ooooooohhhhh yeeessss
---
I do agree with what you are saying, and yeah it has gotten much better over the years, but its still tedious.
---
But this game has a lot of casual players in its fanbase because they're fallout fans, not necessarily hardcore mmo fans, some are both, I like mmo's. I dont mind a grind, but I don't like time gated grinds, I would rather pull several all nighters playing nonstop for a few days and get what I want, I'm not a patient person, and after figuring up how long it will take me to get the secret service armor and the mods i want I'm seriously reconsidering this game. (I just got back into the game btw)
---
I think they weigh 6 without perks.
---
Where in lore anywhere does it say it can hold a person. I've read no terminal entries or notes saying that it can and oxhorn didn't cover it either(and he's extremely thorough). Don't spread false information bruh
---
I mean its not about the devs, its about if your hardware can handle it or not. You are limited by the power of your hardware
---
Ye that's right WOW imagine having 1.2k for miminukes, kudos to you I never have 5hat much storage. I just drop them
---
Love it!!!
---
There's fun tedium and boring tedium. Eating and drinking because you need to eat 5 steaks every 10 minutes is boring. Grinding for rep doing the same 3 dailies is boring. Grinding Radiation Rumble for the rare rewards is fun because the event is fun (IMO).
---
For whatever reason, it is bad game design. To stop dupers? ROFL. I don't believe they have the ability to stop dupers in this game. Coming up on 2 years, can't count the updates,  people still duping. It's so bad, people don't even see it as a cheat or game braking anymore, it's just another feature.
---
Considering the limited options available to buy through gold bullion, we should be able to stockpile, in hopes of better future content.
---
Ahhhh. Sorry, I was referring to the Chinese copy.  Thanks for challenging, because technically you are absolutely correct.
---
I almost never die. Only have 3 END with radicool and 2 ranks of fireproof. Max blocker, dodgy, and serendipity are insane. Can tank 10+ hits from anything.
---
Problem is that you consider it tedium because it doesn't offer you anything worthwhile and only demands your time. People spend all their free time on games like World of Warcraft, and to an outsider, pretty much every part of that game could be considered "tedium". The only real difference between content and tedium is whether you feel like the game is treating you fairly and the amount of time and effort you put in is in balance with the reward or satisfaction you get out of it.
---
It makes tunnels...

&gt;!During the settlers quest line you make tunnels with Motherlode to access the gold vault.!&lt;

Ok so when im attacking it does one of a few things. 1 normal damage. 2 half or quarter damage. 3 no damage at all.
---
You play on a console, right?
---
When she flies off in the distance try and figure out where she will loop back around to and then run over and try to be there before she finishes her loop.  If she sees a target there when she completes her loop she will attempt to land (as long as someone doesn't stagger her in the air before she tries).
---
You get to run around like an idiot but if you want her to land then you will have to take the initiative yourself sometimes, along with getting smacked around by her when she lands on you.
---
No, my gpu is utilised fully, so not it.
---
It's not lazy, it's a function that means you dont have to load an extra 1200% everytime you enter a city.. Imagine how that would Work for loadtimes if you had to load All cells All the time ..
---
can you still reap XP bonuses, other boasts, from the vegetable based items you create? That would be the only reason I know of to avoid bother carnivore and herbivore.
---
No worries lol just figured I'd make the suggestion either way, Xbox is the only one that has a way to find people like that
---
Terry approves!
---
Chaos and order perhaps?
---
How is the hunger and thirst mechanic not anything but tedium? It's not beneficial at all.
---
Well you should've said that instead of via the motherload because that gives off the impression that the motherload can hold people. Otherwise yes it can make tunnels but it's reach is limited to places around APPALACHIA. I doubt it can leave Appalachia all together. The brotherhood would to dig there own tunnels to reach motherloads tunnels
---
I don't think they'd do dual wield pistols because it isn't an animation set they've really dabbled with.
---
Dual wield one handed weapons though, they could probably port over from Skyrim. I'd also think dual wielding two handed weapons in Power Armor would be insanely amusing.
---
Yeah it WAS...
---
EL-7 is gold.....
---
I have to click on that thing every single time.  Guaranteed 1 star lead pipe when you play it!
---
And also yes ik it gets you to vault 79 in the settler part of the quest
---
Yes, please. I go whitespring bunker quite often and it's a nightmare.
---
I purged my stash and everything I wasn't using at the time (got sick of stuff I thought I would need but never used) stuck some weight reduction perks on and just picked them up if I saw them.
---
Yeah, when it's active you'll see the same icon that's in the perk card at the top left. I ran it for a while but I've never seen this in work in power armor. We require emergency protocols instead (chest mod for power armor)
---
I solo'd my first during the beta at around level 10, at the time they were bugged and just sat there and took the beating. I broke tire irons and lead pipes on his face after exhausting all my ammo lol.
---
A lot of them are starting to revert that process now that they're noticing that it isn't a sustainable model though. Even the pretty stubborn Blizzard is starting to step back from casualizing everything and the overreliance on RNG, even using that as major selling points for their next WoW expansion.  
---
I get that Bethesda is new to this and hasn't had years and years to learn from it like Blizzard and others, but they shouldn't even have to. You can learn from your competitors' mistakes too.
---
Overseer knew about the experiments on vault dwellers and did nothing with the information. She is as self serving as any of the other groups. Like others are saying, good is subjective
---
Kind of true. If the player who does most damage is on a fence or on a tent, she will not come down. She will aggro that player but sees that player is not on the ground so she won't land. So it is not a matter of majority, just that one player she aggros against.
---
As to why people do this: these are players that can't take much damage or they'll die. The majority is probably bloodied. I also try to do this when playing with a bloodied character but usually only last five seconds, then I instinctively join the battle below. stealth is just not my thing.
---
The Chinese copy? I'm confused
---
True and I would even say that this game would even benefit if they included more things that would make FO76 different from the rest of the looters. I mean CAMP is already one huge thing and survivalish other, but what if FO76's endgame would not be loot centered, but something completely different(loot of course being one aspect)?
---
Is that the one inside one of the trailers on the wall? I’ve had the same thing happen there.
---
They'll have magically appeared after maintenance.
---
So if we take out all of the parts of the game that people find boring what will we be left with?  Is getting mats for ammo and crafting it "boring"?  Maybe we should just remove the ammo requirements.  Is farming flux "boring"?   Maybe we should just take it out and make nothing require flux anymore!
---
These are extreme examples but the further 'casualization' of MORPG games is a slippery slope.
---
Ok so this is for a quest to make an item. I always loot all the containers when im here because its similar to pharma pharma perk where everyone can see the item and loot it. But for some reason it duplicates for each persons instanced loot. So if you have like 3 people do that quest on the server there will be 3 lots of that stuff in there for anyone who opens it.
---
Last I heard damage cap was 190, I may be out of the loop.
---
Stuff like this freaks me out
---
Hence this suggestion?
---
It’s Bethesda... what else did you expect besides a kick in the teeth?
---
I wish I could have that amount space left lmao
---
Yeah well like you said they've been around for a long time and have made their fair share of stumbles as well.  I do agree that they should look more at other MORPG games to see what features are SORELY lacking from this one that have been in other MORPG games for years.
---
Yep, the one on the nothern most side of the compound.
---
Just sell everything in your vendor for 1 cap each. Most stuff will sell real quick.
---
It wasn’t that big of a deal without class freak. Speed demon and Marsupial are game changers, get on it. Also recommend looking at eagle eyes, bird bones if you’re non melee. And healing factor, and egg head. My stats in effects, both egg head and healing factor have NO negatives with full class freak, only the gains.
---
LOL, yeah right... pay for the private server, problem solved...
---
Classe Freak do not work with speed demon.
---
Ah, this makes a lot of sense. I've never actually done the event so I didn't realize it required crafting something and supplied the materials to do so. I forgot to mention, it also had a bunch of raw copper scraps, all of which were listed individually like everything else - I'm guessing they're also required to make the item in question.
---
Get a better gaming chair.
---
Yeh, I see your point haha. It still would be cool if they made that possible.
---
Yeh, running around with 2 10mm automatic pistols in PA that would be cool
---
I assume they're referring to how at the end of Invisible Ties &gt;!you can go to the basement under The Deep and a motherlode machine pops up, which can fast travel you to a couple of set locations for free.!&lt;
---
Junkies, as it's currently broken on high fire rate weapons. You'll get insane damage with it!
---
You never have to farm flux or ammo if you never want to, you can buy them from other players or run a melee build, but everybody is stricken with that ravenous hunger and thirst.
---
Let’s not forget ceiling wallpaper and my favorite, That would go well together: a placement Grid and Rotation snapping. 
---
I’m tired of having to guess if something is straight. Just let me have the option to rotate something 15 degrees at a time
---
yes i tried that, i don't have any mod available. The plans are still available to buy and learn
---
You would think. Though they do still need to keep FO76 'somewhat' lore friendly.. so I doubt we'll see anything amazing as this happens before every other fallout game
---
I think the upvotes say otherwise
---
Not really pointless but close. This is the fact of diminishing returns: the higher your DR (and ER also), the less it matters if you add more resistance.
---
For example a 200DR person is not double as resistant then a 100DR person, it will be a bit less than double. 
---
For example a 300DR person is not triple as resistant then a 100DR person, it will be less then triple.
---
At 350 DR, adding more resistance barely does anything. If you find a piece of armor with better resistance, you can still use it but you will not really notice this during combat.
---
If you want to survive PVP, you'll need the flat % reductions legendary effects on your armor like cavalier (15% less damage while sprinting); sentinel (15% less damage while standing still), limb damage reduction, and the primary effect assasins (8% less damage from players) because these effects make you a lot stronger than the increase of resistance. Except the assasins effect, this also applies to PVE of course.
---
I used to class freak maxed out but I did away with it for perks for my bloodied build... Now I’m running with like 10 mutations and no class freak lessening the negative effects. I don’t really notice any significant downsides.
---
Get herbivore and carry melons, they give food and water at the same time.
---
Yes why ?
---
How is vats broken? 
---
I only sometimes experience some enemies not dying despite taking more than enough damage to be dead but that happens outside of vats too. 
---
I figured it was just a bug with doing too much damage but also NOT enough damage so the enemy regens health
---
T-51b - Chance to ricochet ballistic shots back to enemies.
---
i'll check that out, although i'm 90% sure that it wasn't compound, but i've done stupider things, so it's possible
---
Explosive meat trap mission for Rose.
---
It's something that impacts the entire game, really. I'm pretty sure that the reason that Bethesda doesn't reduce the influence of RNG in the game, despite a lot of people seeming to ask for it, is because they consider getting your "perfect build" the endgame and that once you get that, they'll lose you as a player. In practice, I think it makes a lot of people feel like getting that perfect build is so close to impossible that they might as well not bother. If they moved away from that idea, it would open up a lot of avenues, but that's an entirely different discussion.
---
Yeah, these sets will be rare... until everyone starts trading for the pieces they want.
---
Are they arriving next week?
---
Possibly in tanks/APC's at bases that'll pop up around the map. There's holotapes n such showing that before we left the vault, brotherhood groups had fixed up and used those APC's and huge double barrel tanks you see.  
---
So, most likely, they'll arrive in those as pre-vertibird BoS
---
Some people have sat there for weeks and weeks trying to get the best build that’s viable for end game. Just for instance it took me a long time to get the perfect elemental projector - seeing that I have to grind for endless hours to get the best gear then others who pick a different build (Moze in this case) don’t need to do this said grind at all to do even more damage than I can from grinding... it’s a little unbalanced. I don’t think IB should be nerfed to the ground like Fl4K once was, I believe it should be tweaked to needing to have certain gear to throw out the damage IB is doing naturally. Otherwise I’m going to run a Moze build and ignore the gear grinds altogether... makes the game 10x faster. IB is in a good place but it just needs to be shifted to needing certain gears to boost IB. Otherwise it’s just too op imo
---
very frustrating as you have no idea what quest they are on
---
Ok.
---
Yo I posted on here with a message for a complete different game. I’m sorry lol
---
Food needs to stay but be relevant. One guy summed up Elder Scrolls Oblivion as 'live another life in another world', which I've kinda applied to my time playing F76.
---
I actually enjoy collecting food and prepping it in my mountain retreat. It's immersion. It just needs some dialling back on thirst and hunger and some extra buffs to make the culinary side beneficial and enjoyable. It's a cool concept and needs to stay.
---
Time and space are sort of weirdly compressed in games like this, in order to simulate a large expanse of territory but still make it fun to play.  True, the hunger and thirst meters are faster than IRL, but IRL *you can't jog from Charleston to Middle Mountain between sunup and sunset.*
---
Exactly, I tried doing the Wayward quest with a friend
---
Ok talk to Duchess shell send you on a quest
---
Ok now we go to your camp and build the sign
---
How do I build it?
---
You need to learn the plan in your notes tab
---
I don't have any plans in my notes tab
---
Alright back to Duchess
---
badges are not to bad, i’m actually stuck on needing to revive a teammate,,   anyone on pc wanna be my friend??  i’m active pretty knowledgeable, have a mic and no life.  bonus i’m a guy..   sonofarobot is my pc name feel free to add
---
I run rank 3 blocker, rank 3 fireproof, rank 3 nerd rage and rank 3 serendipity. 
---
My armor isn’t the best tbh. DR and ER only a bit above 300 each and RR is only at like 50ish
---
All on foot, maybe a working vertibird or 2. That's pretty much it I think unless they gained access to some secret underground militairy arsenal and plundered its weapons and vehicles.
---
The real end goal is fashion76.
---
Too bad they won't go swing their e-peen at Encryptid.
---
But i guess its no fun if the enemy can melt you too
---
Better than my Tesla yesterday! Every time I'd shoot an enemy, it would go down to ~1HP but never 0 so it couldn't die, no matter how much you shot at it. Eventually once you stop shooting, it will heal all of its health back in about 2 seconds. Muy frustrating.
---
As someone who has struggle with a crippling anxiety disorder, who also developed some really bad paranoia about a year after the anxiety started - you can do it man. It took me 2 years to find a combination that works, but the grass is so much greener on the other side. I remember the first med I found that helped with my anxiety, I woke up and bawled my eyes out for an hour because I was so relieved. The paranoia was worse though... It's very sinister. It makes you turn on everyone you love. I became convinced my whole family and girlfriend were working in cahoots to try and control me, tracking my phone, reading my messages somehow.... Of course it wasn't the case. And the absolute hardest part was realizing my own mind was failing me, and even harder was learning to ignore that terrifying feeling of being watched, tracked, etc.. while there is some creedence to government tracking, it is highly highly automated and rarely ever looked at by a human being and generally only in cases of evidence gathering for major crimes - it's not as big of a worry as you may think, and that's so so so fucking hard to understand and believe, but man, as someone who's gone through something similar, it's so worth it to fight the battle. As much as it seems like it isn't the case, you can get better and learn to trust the world again - I promise. You can do it brother, I believe in you.
---
all I notice is that Im still the most interesting thing in this thread...
---
Have rank 3 tank killer, rank 3 bloody mess and rank 3 adrenaline, Stinging mag and suppressor. 
---
Full unyielding set and road leathers makes my agility about 32
---
I completely agree with all 4 points there, I was so disappointed when I paid atoms for the fridge and the items don't stack! How tiny is this fridge on the inside? Also sucking the fridge and leaving it open to random players to either buy from or just raid when they've got the munchies... That would be cool!
---
As it is I spend a bunch of time farming ingredients for specific buffs it would be great if there was a way to share it without it spoiling so quickly in the vendor
---
Explore the Deep.  Very carefully.
---
Thank you. Was hoping otherwise but oh well
---
Why should I have to repair my weapons and armor?  So tedious.. Why do I need to scrap weapons and armor to know mods?  So tedious, shouldn't I just have them all known? 
---
I could go on and on and on and on.  Dumb the game down now and it'll just get worse and worse.  But hey it's already happening so this is pretty much a moot discussion.  They are already catering to the lowest common denominator of player.
---
I didn't mean to imply that it should be changed just because that's not how it is IRL, that'd be a pretty stupid approach to game design. It should be changed because it's an unengaging and tedious system that doesn't accomplish what it envisioned. The RL comparison was mainly to preemptively adress any "it's for the sake of realism/immersion" remarks.
---
not gunna lie it kind of bothers me as well, it makes it sound like a positive thing when its legit just bugged.
---
When Massive wanted to kill The Division 1, because they were releasing 2, they gave players a way to completely max everything. When I had every build maxed I probably played The Division 1 for a week and that was it. I had no reason to play it. 
---
Beth doesn't want to kill 76 yet and RNG is one(lazy) way to keep it alive.
---
I didnt read all that but I enjoy the current food mechanics...
---
Oh you mean the one room where you go through the laser grid and see the motherload? That is pretty strange, I wonder if hornwright has dealings with China?!
---
This. Feels like you are sneaking at the same pace as you used to walk.
---
Also question. How do you get that thing next to your name
---
I like the idea of the food and drink system, nominally. Having to remember to eat and drink every so often is fine. And it’s also fine that there are options for people who want to keep their involvement light (like me) and live off canned dog food and purified water, and other people who want to cook up a storm.
---
To me the issues is that outside that baseline dog food/water combo, it’s too much effort to reward. You can spend literal hours making, say, a Cranberry meatball grinder, then get distracted from the game for a few days, and it’s rotted. Or you make a stack of Radstag steaks, but have to come back to camp to rescue them from the cooler, or...they rot because you carry them with you, and can’t eat them fast enough.
---
That and the benefit to effort ratio of a lot of the recipes doesn’t feel right. It’s so much easier to just drink nuke and water from scavenging, and eat your canned food. The hassle:benefit ratio doesn’t feel right for cooking.
---
Oh god poison, my worst enemy
---
Vampire works well, especially with an automatic weapon.
---
Also works well with melee builds.
---
combined with healing factor mutation, and your stimpack requirement goes way down.
---
i wish the damned thing didn't clip through the roof when you put the wall cabinet up :/
---
My character was guzzling down buckets of water *before* I got the mutation, and it still feels the same *with* the mutation. Honestly, I can't tell the difference.
---
The speed difference is definitely noticeable though.
---
If they got rid of the radio, it would be like driving nails in my coffin
---
Here’s my perk load out:

https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=3e353ee&amp;d=sg2p01pg2ph2pi2eh2c72cu0ir2a72ar1an2ao0a51a02pp2la2l71l12lt2lu2
---
I replied to him later with this, but I spent a while writing it and wanted to share because I think it's a better way to approach folks like him and previously me; we're already on guard and ready for attack from all angles so it's really hard to take simple statements like that seriously. Maybe this could also help someone else who stumbles across it, who knows. But this is my message to anyone dealing with paranoid thoughts or relentless anxiety...
---
I believe it's a copy
---
Here’s my load out:
---
You still get the XP for crafting any food regardless of whether or not you have the Carnivore/Herbivore mutation
---
Not the crafting of it, the bonuses from eating it. That’s my question
---
Unfortunately no, Steel Dawn is coming this autumn and Fractured Steel is coming is coming this winter
---
I think Steel Dawn will be the rogue unit arriving in Appalachia, and Fractured Steel will be a different brotherhood unit showing up wanting to know why they haven't been in contact (all speculation)
---
It sounds to me like you hit a bug where you learned the plan locally but the request to the server that you learned the plan failed, so the game “forgot”.  Only Bethesda can fix this, but you may have better luck buying and learning the plan again.
---
Why am I getting down voted lmfao. I put in a shit ton of time and effort to get my build as strong as it is and I STILL have the courtesy to nerf myself down a bit so other people have a chance to have some fun and burn some ammo. I don't HAVE to do that and I CERTAINLY don't have to do it on a private server. Let people play how they enjoy playing. If you're butthurt people do more damage than you get a better build instead of crying about it. Smfh some of yall wanna do nothing but complain and call everyone that hits hard a cheater or exploit abuser when that's just not the fucking case.
---
You get those too. It shows you this on the item’s inspect screen. So you may see 0% as food but still see 5% XP boost, for example.
---
It's bascially the same missed opportunity as in FO4. They had the Arena in Boston. And the Ghoul Tommy talks about getting the place running again, but they didn't bother to implement it.
---
Evil is a strong word yes but it certainly needs some 'creativity' to say the crater raiders and enclave are in any way good.
---
They promised us "a real faction based PvP" in 2018.
---
Yeah, and the videos about how OP the effects were still ARE up online for people new to the game to find, with no reference to the fact that it ended up being nerfed hard.  
---
New players getting outdated info is how it continues to come up.
---
Sweet, great to know! Just to be clear, if you go herbivore, meat doesn’t satisfy the hunger meter?
---
You got it.
---
Which daily? I can never get "wasted on..." To trigger, only "tipsy taste test"
---
That actually puzzled me a little, I mean it's cool we're getting groups, and the bonuses from them, but I can't see the need for groups while killing Radroaches at the "tea time" etc. Agreed we certainly need some group grind engame, as I've only ever needed groups for Atom challenges/mutation buffs
---
yeah, shotguns are amazing. I use mine and it one-shots most enemies. I don't even use any shotgun damage perks. lol
---
I can’t get either one. Literally nothing. Server hopped. Logged out. Nothing.
---
I think you mean the Flairs, right?
---
Head to the main r/Fo76 page and click the three dots menu at the top (android mobile, may be slightly different otherwise)
---
Then select Change User Flair, there are a fair number of options :)
---
Word seems fine to me.
---
How is my minigun with extra BASH DAMAGE able to disintegrate a SB in 5 seconds flat? Because "magic", that's how.
---
I’ll freely craft you a composite bow with explosive arrows if you’d like. My GT is JCVDylon. Just let me know your GT and what level of bow you’d like, and we can coordinate the drop off.
---
Because on PC you'd favourited the mask ans used betterinventory to keep it. I also could have give you a replacement :/
---
So who is choosing herbivore and why?
---
Ah well shit
---
Hopefully theres an event like fortnite or destiny that shows them all driving to fort defiance in jeeps, apcs and tanks
---
They just need to nerf the op builds and this will not be a problem
---
Just checking but check your quest list. Do you by chance have one from him already but have it toggled as not active?
---
I’ve tried it and it’s nice if you have a food farm in your camp, feels like you’re self-sufficient. Also vegetables are lighter, and some of the basics fulfill both food and water needs.
---
Lol nope. Made that mistake before.
---
Have to eat a lot more to fill up since it’s less dense?
---
subjective: If you are on a team, best I can figure, most critters go after the highest level player on the team.
---
Reasoning: The group I play with has been together for quite some time, currently L206, 193, 192, and 90.  Who was the highest level has leapfrogged, but I've noticed in general, the mob runs right by the 3 lower levels to swarm the high level.
---
I’d say it’s because of a bugged legendary effect, whose messed up script causes a damage overflow. See, that’s why “it’s magic” sounds just so uninformed.
---
Omg thank you! I really appreciate it.
---
I think this is great. 
---
I found that the writers of Fallout 76 were given unfair hand by Bethesda's unwillingness to have human NPC's in a multiplayer game.  This unwillingness leads to the game's story being overlooked and kind of boring as it feels way too convenient that everyone is dead.
---
Let's hope that we have the free States and Enclave to return
---
You can add me and I will do it if you don't get anyone else and we are online at the same time.  IGN is the same as my Reddit.  I am back to work for the week though so won't be on until either tonight or early tomorrow morning.
---
You being a guy seems like the opposite of a bonus to me though lol.
---
A little more than meat, but remember you’re getting double the effect. Again, nice when water and food are handled at the same time.
---
Make them untradeable
---
No problem :) I think they're great lol
---
Ooh I like that, maybe be able to schedule your default meals or just follow flags like you said. Maybe make it "smart" and try to avoid just slamming the same food that you're using for a buff and will look for neutral foods while the buff is still up.
---
The way the food/drink requirement currently is, is just tedious. Needing to click on an item every few minutes to satisfy an arbitrary meter isn’t a fun mechanic, it adds nothing interesting to the gameplay experience. This is especially true when we consider how common food and drinks are. If they were scarce resources, then it could make some sense, requiring you to go hunt for food. As it stands, it’s just a question of clicking on which of 7,000 food items you already have. 
---
As such, they can go two ways; remove that aspect or build a system of robust, immersive, gameplay enhancing hunger/thirst mechanics. I’d prefer to see the latter—which would certainly include some of your suggestions—I just don’t think it’s realistic. 
---
They haven’t been able to keep hunger/thirst consistent from one patch to the next since the game came out. I can only imagine the can of worms additional complications to the system would open. I’d rather have a big, robust, interesting system, but if we can’t have that, then I’m happy to not have to click on items every 15 minutes to fill that otherwise pointless meter.
---
They’d have to have weaker legendary modifiers that regular armor. The only reason regular armor is as viable as it is is because they’re legendary
---
absolutely agree...
---
imagine making fresh pressed orange juice only for it to spoil 1 hour later, 3 hours later if you put it in your fridge.
---
I seriously can’t identify the Crater Raiders as evil.  The Foundation Settlers seem more nasty and selfish in comparison.
---
When people do that most people are thankful. You should’ve been shooting it instead of standing around emoting like half the peoppe
---
You just receive a generator plan, you have not learned yet, at random.
---
I started my heavy gunner a couple weeks ago and the first generator I pulled from that event ended up being the fusion one.
---
Because Fallout wasn't designed for pvp, that's their mistake. They need to completely renovate the entire controls and combat system for pvp if they want to make it work.
---
Their best bet at this point is to make pvp an entirely separate entity to the normal game, basically a different game if they want it to work, otherwise it will never be good
---
Can't edit post titles so: Supply drop not spawning?*
---
I am on mobile and semi mad so sorry for spelling mistakes
---
The "Settler Wanderer" ally has some good words of encouragement as well.
---
It’s a shitty, very cumbersome system that should’ve never been in the game to begin with.
---
It only exists to further atom purchases and it brings gameplay way down.
---
Yea its really silly how it is waterproof and air sealed but poison finds the way through...
---
Now here’s an informed person. This is what I understand it to be, too.
---
Thanks for the detailed explanation.
---
You can server hop for more legendary modules
---
&gt; You just receive a generator plan, you have not learned yet, at random.
---
Thanks for clarifying that for me, it's been nearly 2 years since I did the powerplants and then you'd needed 3 runs for the fusion one.
---
He ended up sleeping on it!
---
Nothing; that sounds trash, and it doesn't describe my experience with it.
---
It all depends on what cards you use and what legendary weapons you have.
---
If you're on PC, I have a spare fusion generator plan you could have if you still need it.
---
Yes! I'm now with the bos!
---
Right, right. That all makes sense. Jw for the sentinel to work you have to actually be standing? Cant be crouched? And damage caps at 110 per shot is what I heard?
---
I agree 100% with you man, that’s exactly what I told all my friends. It’s super obvious too because of how unbalanced everything is...y’all remember the how OP the shotguns were? lol
---
Horse back
---
Didn’t they just find them?
---
Damage resistance is different from damage cap.
---
No. They built them. They had a whole fleet until a storm in the mountains destroyed it
---
If you're so super amazing at this game why don't you let other people get their hits in and then swoop in like the absolute legendary hero that you are in and finish her with one hit. 
---
Ad if you think there's absolutely nothing wrong with doing that much damage with one swing.. well. Well! WELL! There's something wrong with doing that much damage per swing.
---
Yea before they realized most players had zero interest in pvp
---
This game has far too many currencies.  There should only be caps. 
---
 Although, I try to find some humor that a limit on the alternate currencies is a cap.
---
Correct on both.   
---
HOWEVER some weapons have a broken legendary effect that ignores the damage cap, like a railway rifle with +33% VATS hit chance is one shot-one kill from what I've heard (still looking for one to test it out)
---
I would love to just be in the area when he goes sailing by. That would be hilarious!
---
As a bloodied build it does take effort to make and run it. 
---
BUT...i do have the common sense not to go to Uranium fever and other low level events using my SBQ melter. That's just bad form. WE need more 'gonna get pwned' events.
---
They don't have them yet. They will obtain Vertibird plans in Fallout 2, after 200 years from now...
---
I have a full set of Unyielding, bloody weapons etc, it all sits in my stash because being that powerful is boring as hell lmao
---
Yeah I am level 444. The cryolater just breaks too damn fast.
---
Cool!
---
Lol Im kidding dude. Calm down.
---
Managed to make a nice vampire's Gauss mini and it is really nice for sheepsquatch imposter!
---
Easy there mister wendigo
---
If you dropped the nuke to start the event, I feel like you have the right to dispose of it as fast as you choose. But if somebody else spent the half hour doing all that work and launched, as a courtesy to them and their possible teammates, there’s no way that’s ok. Just my opinion.
---
Food shouldn't spoil in vendors at all. I LOVE cooking all the recipes in the game but literally it's fucking pointless because it spoils so quick no one has the time to buy it. If they made it 90% spoil less rate and turned the cooler into a vendor like you mentioned that would be great.
---
Supply drops are overrated anyway.
---
The update isn’t until tomorrow, but excited to see how much of a grind this will actually be. Like, how easy will it actually be to get score points
---
I like the current food &amp; water system as it is right now but I hate cooking system. I understand steaks and soups can spoil over time and it's ok but why our characters can't make food wich didn't spoil over time like some peckled vegetables / fruits or even homemade canned meat? So we can build water purifiers and nuclear reactors at our camps but can't cook canned food? That's BS! That's why I never bother with cooking anymore and eat only dog food.
---
15 min tops it’s just some number changes
---
I show up as soon as possible, land my damage, then by all means, melt away. Same with Encryptid. I mean, I'm level 230, full Bloodied also worked to get my Perks, gear, and weapons. At this point I just want my participant rewards; I even pay for and trigger Encryptid once or twice a twice and don't care about "melters" showing up.
---
I'm hoping the real magic will take place after they have rolled out seasons
---
5 steaks and 3 bottles of purified water. I'd fucking explode if I ate that much IRL. But I eat about that much every hour or so in game. I understand the concept of game time being faster than RL time but this does not compute.
---
I been using a junkies explosive railway rifle and it only works about half the time in vats but when it does it kills them in like 2 secs. Idk if they made the vats only work sometimes or what but it's literally like 50/50 chance vats will work
---
I’m actually dreading the update because they’re taking away our free atoms from daily and weekly challenges... 1500 atoms every 3 months is bullsh*t.
---
If you go to the Whitesprings vendor strip, every so often one or mor of the vendors will sell multiple Power Fists. But them and scrap them, and you'll learn it quick enough. That's what I ended up doing 🤷‍♂️
---
Dual wield melee🤞
---
I've just changed from a bloodied stealth commando to a junkies Hervey gun pa user. Whilst the damage from the bloodied was clearly higher, I MUCH prefer the junkies build I'm running now. Firstly, it's liberating not having to sneak around and worry about a radroach nibbling my toes until I die. But, you're far more versatile as a junky. Also, junkies gear tends to be a bit cheaper / easier to come by than bloodied / unyielding.
---
Yes please! That would actually be of much help to me.
---
My username is WhereIsMyBeret, if you can add me.
---
lol ok but they 'fixed' the ability to trade the backpack plans a long time ago, it's the grind now
---
So here is a question about this event. I have come in to it having Glowing Ghouls all of the floor and they have all been Crippled to the point of just crawling and I go in to kill them and I get the thumbs down from teammates. Is there some sort of way I should be running this particular Event?
---
I see item durability mechanics in games the same way I see hunger and thirst mechanics. Items are either so overwhelmingly easy to break that you can not keep anything for long, or they last for so long that they might as well not even have durability. This is another example of something everybody has to deal with. Not to mention that they added repair kits as a way to monetize a manufactured issue of your stuff breaking (and then there's the coolers, but thankfully those are underwhelming).
---
As for the crafting, you never need to bother with it if you dislike it. Even if you do enjoy learning weapon mods, you can't even do it the same way for the new gold bullion items. It's a shame that's not consistent.
---
2 of my 4 characters have "airships" so the commander fits right in. Raider punk works too. 
---
However one of those airships didn't have room for the nukashine benches so I built a little moonshine cabin. Gramps and Beckett for well there. 
---
My third's camp is a little town. I built a little stage for all the instruments, as you can imagine the wanderer is best suited for there. 
---
My 4th still has a temp camp, no theme. I just have Beckett but for no particular reason.
---
I use purified water for healing. Two birds.
---
I agree, there are many rewards that need to be reworked, like 20 atoms for 7600 hours in game? 2000 or better 7600 atoms are suitable if someone spend so much time with a broken game...
---
Todd can fix that.
---
with the right cards you can live off dog food and pond water just fine
---
Easy? I still miss an unstoppables, even though i have the magazine sound perk equiped, and some times uses an hour to grind for magazines, i still miss that one and 10 others for other achievements.... They seem to be excessively random and rare even after 800 hours in the game.
---
Also the Stimpack diffuser recipie is impossible to get on PS4, as noone hardly ever does Project Paradise, and if they do they only focus on 1 zone (i believe 3 is required for even a chance of the plan to drop), also have never seen anyone selling diffusers :(
---
I do have a plasma grenade plan to spare :)
---
Yeah, increased stash size is extremly hard to beat by anything.
---
Still OP did a pretty good job, this is a great suggestion, albeit the bonuses would need some tweaking.
---
Hey any idea exactly what plans they're missing on xb1? I'd like to help out if possible even though I'm not a real "grindy" person and I'm fairly new to Fallout (only about a month or two in).
---
Blue ridge for the cap buffs, then again I don’t do high end trading so I still rely on the value of the cap.
---
Ridiculous that the Jangles beer stein is a lvl 100 reward. Really the only thing I want.
---
Sure thing! Mine is Phattybluntz
---
I currently have 2400 557 out of the the 7000 I had before this fight... Ouch. ha ha
---
I have junkies 25% fire rate auto grenade launcher. You would think this is really nice roll. If I use full rank Explo expert and Bloody mess I can't still oneshot supermutant. I have also done some testing with various rocker launchers a fatmans. Rockets do abysmal damage and fatman broke after 3 shots on group of ghouls at Golf club... I would love to bring my auto grenade launcher for groups of enemies and rocker launcher with targeting computer for bats, but simple .50 does better job...
---
take it too far and you've got GTA:SA
---
I had CJ running back and forth between the gym and burger shot trying to make two different women happy, wtf I thought the game was about stealing cars
---
I’m in the same boat here. I’ve got them immediately every other month, but this month I’m getting a delay
---
I’m level 180 and have this problem with my mate whose a newish player on Xbox, for some reason it use to show but now it doesn’t.  Would love to know this answer as well. It’s quite difficult remembering missions as he’s not the best at following the location bar at the bottom lol
---
I already done said I don't go all out on public servers lmao. Half the time on public server runs i just BS around and try to hit her in the air with my jetpack. I totally disagree though. The damage I do is legitimate and I suffer several penalties to achieve it. Low health with virtually no damage resistance. Almost everything one shots me unless serendipity goes off lmfao. 
---
I'm gonna do whatever I want regardless of whose nuke it is though regarldess of wether or not some people think I'm a cunt for it. Also, I didn't youtube this build. I tested the fuck out of everything myself until I found perks, weapons and buffs that worked for me. Theory crafting builds is my favorite part of this game right next to camp building. Not everyone who is good had to google it.
---
Dick
---
I have the 'lite' allies at my camps. I like the raider punk best (have him dressed in a civil war suit and bowler hat), but the scavenger and wanderer are as nice to have. I just pick the ally that goes with the character/camp. If you visit camps  regularly/ flip servers more than once during a session you'll find all three pretty quick.
---
I love being super powerful! I find it very fun. More power to you though.
---
I’d actually have a hard time choosing between responders or free states. I’d just keep on using my inventory management degree I have obtained through this game 😂😂
---
That's awesome.
---
Wahhh cry about it.
---
I’m currently running a TS 25% less V.A.T.S. ap cost +33% Vats hit chance Lever action, and while it does not do the best from a distance, it destroys anything that is close.
---
That’s probably one of the nicer descriptions I’ve heard for them. Accurate too.
---
To change each individual food value? What are you on about?
---
That's correct but you're missing a point. Dr has diminishing return if the incoming damage is always the same. 
---
But try getting punched by the queen with 350 dr or 500. You'll see the difference.
---
Looks like your the one crying lmao, look at your post 🤣
---
Its fun from time to time with friends and some ground rules. But I’m not interested in that part of the game with randos. If something like this would be implemented I’d be more interested in that.
---
I like events like Line in the Sand. Waves of mobs coming. Would love to scale this at faction levels where you have an event popup where players are called to arms. 2 to 3 factions Duke it out over an area or resources with a massive number of mobs spawning. I mean massive. Mobs are double HP and can wreck you. One shotties would finally have a challenge. Oh and objectives as well.
---
Yeah but youre the one trying to insult me because I hit harder than you 🤣🤣🤣
---
I do the same with mini-nukes.
---
Fair enough :)
---
Gotta be honest though, if you nuke it go ahead, but if someone else nukes it and you kill it immediately yeah that's not cool, they might have to go back to their camp to repair or something and not even get a hit
---
With my AA Stealth Commando I could solo the queen, but the mechanic where she flies so far away that her health regens screws me, I can get her almost dead 3 times but she always flies away and heals
---
They wont go down its bethesda. But that said I wont miss the daily challenges. I never did them.
---
There's nothing legitimate about bloodied. Needs a huge nerf. Same for junkies. Why do people need a 90% and a 50% damage boost? Game is way too easy as it is.
---
I'm excited for the ammo converter even though my two main weapons both have Prime receivers, but it'll mean I can start using .44 and .38 to start making sellable ammo.
---
Also, just the general progression off the "board game" style thing might make things interesting.
---
Wow great effort OP let’s see if Bethesda will look at this.
---
How long it takes the hunger and thirst bars to drop. But also just poking fun at ops estimate.
---
For 25 caps a pop it can be worth it to take over a couple unwanted workshops for the free fast travel.
---
This creates a secondary problem. You either:
---
* You have to leave the indoor space if where you actually wanted to go was the outdoor one
---
* Need to have 2 fast travel spots - one for exterior, one for interior, which not only adds unnecessary complexity but twice as many icons, making for a cluttered interface
---
* Have to create a new interface to handle which of the two you want - in or out, which is an extra button click
---
Given the cost of implementing it for not that big of a benefit, I'd rather keep things as they are. Maybe add a few here or there like for the whitesprings but not for every place.
---
I find the free states one to be bias as they are the only faction to receive legendaries in an easy fashion. I agree with the rest but I dont think i can get behind that one.
---
Yep! Should be able to!
---
i hope its not that easy as it was in red dead online. they added outlaw passes, basically 100 ranks with stuff but every xp gained counted for it. so, most of the everyday players grinded it in like 3 or 4 days and had to wait months for the next one - at least, there were passes back then. anyways, as i got it, you have to do the daily quests to progress in it and that sounds nice. of course, some people will do all quests every day and complain about the lack of content after some time but thats ok. overall it seems like beth makes it better than rockstar here.  
---
and of course, main goal at first will be the ammo converter. later on, that bloody raider gas mask looks really nice in combination with the bloody handmade skin. we'll see, im really looking forward to it :)
---
um..ok?
---
Your best bet is to get someone that has the right perks to mod the power fist for you.
---
... wow. You don't even need exploits to get your special past 30. Even without unyielding you can get special past 30. Im so done lmfao
---
Why not just walk the last bit? You move faster over the map than you think.
---
Nope :/ that plan will never drop for me for me. Done the event like 10+ times
---
Yeah there are some great mods in Fo4 that do this.
---
Im anxious to see the huge meltdowns when people earn currencies for rewards while they are at the cap for said currencies and do not get them...
---
the only reward I am looking forward to are Perk Card Packs.. so I can spend them on Legendary Perks.. 
---
and to a lesser degree the pittance of Atoms they graced us with leaving in as rewards..
---
Bethesda if you read this Fix the weapons.. Oh and dailies..
---
Alright, thanks!
---
You can still get a few extra caps from selling stuff. Even if it's 1 cap per item it's still worth it in my opinion
---
I'm against people melting the sbq and it's glitched weapons that are allowing players to melt her. 
---
That said, how many scorched earths have you launched OP? 95% of the SE events are from my group, players just don't launch them much.
---
I use a instigating, explosive, +1 Perception Lever Action Rifle.  It’s really a great gun.  I can one-shot level 68 scorched when sneaking.  I’m not really spec’d our for rifles though. Mostly heavy guns but use this when it in PA.
---
Am I the only one who can fast travel from inside of locations? Wtf
---
Its weird cause when I join it with people, it’s harder to do. I’m sure cause more robots spawn. But I agree, SBQ and PP is much easier
---
Yeah soloing her is annoying. I've done it once and don't bother with it anymore because if something happens like her regen or she stays super high up its just annoying lol. I typically bring 1 or 2 heavy gunners or commando builds along with me for the super quick private server runs. Public i just fuck around and try to hit her in midair with my jetpack on for the most part lmfao
---
Sweet add me Im on most days
---
Instigating Hunting rifle because it feels pretty balanced.    
---
   
---
Hits really hard and you're punished if you miss that tasty headshot by its terrible firerate.
---
There is a time lock before you can request another supply drop. 
---
Honestly I wouldn’t bother.  They never have anything decent.  You can get everything just be going to different locations and grabbing all the stuff.
---
Honestly not knowing that is just a testament to how uninformed the community can be on what they play.   Prime example was with old workshop PVP and people crying "Hacker!!!" when they died out in the world with a workshop claimed.
---
Awesome add me we can grind together!!
---
Add a new recipe: anti-venom that removes poisons and grants a very short term immunity, then add an anti-venom auto injector legendary effect or arm mod.
---
5 plans right now: healing salve mire, healing salve bog, ultracite reactive plates, safari croc backpack, lever gun SK receiver. That's it!
---
Ok now this is AWESOME! The game needs soemthing like this!
---
ghillyfying everything i own.
---
No punishment for eating the same food.
---
Don't make the system even more annoying.
---
Water and food should definitely drain slower but also sprinting and ap regeneration should speed up the drain.
---
All the food cards and good with salt should just become the norm for gameplay.
---
Rotting food is at best a cute gameplay mechanic and at worst just a stupid negative to an already unnecessary gameplay element.
---
I'm not gonna go out of my way to get fresh ingredients when half the time they rot before even being useful.
---
Since the BETA, I have almost exclusively eaten canned dog food and utilised the "good doggy" perk. I store bubblegum for the "chew 5 bubblegum" challenges, and have a heap of Halloween candy for the "prewar food" and "candy, cakes and pies" challenge. And there are enough CAMPs around the world with purified water (and I collect every one I see when exploring various locations I go to) that I don't need to worry about that either. I do wish the drain was slower and more realistic, I just eat/drink when it gives me the pop-up.
---
I would love to have a more varied diet, but the food crafting is SO laggy and takes forever, and it's better just to sell the ingredients for caps!
---
I have yet to solo the SBQ. I’ve done the wendigo somewhat solo. I think we’re quite opposite. SBQ scares me. Any pointers taking her solo? I’m a junkie/commando build
---
&gt; it's a money item ffs,the backpack is better!
---
That's exactly why it shouldn't, unless if they put a free freezer in the game that does that too.
---
Yeah if I had one person with a vampire weapon just to keep her attention and basically be immortal I could handle the DPS in no time lol
---
The jetpack is fun but I missed my ap bonus so now I have 2 Vanguard's secret service chests lol, keep them on my favourites and switch between jetpack and ultralight
---
To be fair, this game is lacking a lot of basic features that have existed in other MORPG games for 20+ years so there is going to be a lot of request posts.
---
I feel like there's a pretty fair balance on here except when something happens and there are 100+ repeat posts.
---
She's nothing but an unreliable bullet sponge. I only die to the poison mobs she spawns if I die at all. It's a really blah fight with zero mechanics or sequences to learn.
---
After I got the refrigerator that didn’t preserve much food for very long, I became disenchanted with the fridge. It’s there mostly for show. My character "knows" all these recipes but rarely gets to make them because of the spoilage rate. My character mainly eats mole rats, and mutt chops. All the recipes seem useless as the items are spoiled by time you gather them to prepare. I do have perk cards like Better With Salt and others which reduce thirst, etc. It does help slow down the hunger rate. I drink inert flux instead of purified water because it weighs less. 
---
I thought, with the vending system and the coolers, I’d be able to set up a restaurant/bar. Instead, I vend snack cakes and dog food, those preserved for lifetime products. I can also complain about the game, but playing Survivalist, it is about surviving and if that means radiation poisoning has changed the way a body normally processes food, well so be it. Radiation, in RL is the gift that keeps on giving.
---
That is an AMAZING use of those counters!  I'm impressed.
---
I agree the direction is bad - yes I like an easier to manage system, no I don't like taking out a very in your face immersion aspect that makes you constantly think about survival.
---
No joke on bugged weapons.  I currently have 2, one is a mutant slayers so no bonus damage to the queen.  The one that does the most damage is a berserkers and if I use it I am in power armor so it's doing drastically reduced damage. It hits the queen for 2 damage per bullet with headshots....but can kill her in seconds if you hold the trigger down.
---
Not advocating for killing the queen and screwing other people out of loot.  Basically just have them for the novelty of it and will only use it at scorched Earth if the fight has been going for over 20 minutes now.  If something needs a nerf it's this.
---
&gt;Im anxious to see the huge meltdowns when people earn currencies for rewards while they are at the cap for said currencies and do not get them...
---
Pls Todd no... I cannot take it
---
Crater and foundation are neutral at worst/best
---
Had some dialogue from gale make me laugh the other day. "Human make Gail blush. Now leave before human say something stupid and ruin moment." 😆
---
If your looking for specific things use the search function. This game hasn't had much content wise (yes wastelanders was big but once it's finished the game feels empty again) and all the guides are hidden in the piles of players suggesting stuff because we still can't mod the game yet.
---
Nothing tbh , i only play solo and have over 500k ammo from trading over the years . So nothing i need
---
I'm that guy who loves finding a paper bag on the ground filled with 40mm grenades. I have an Executioners 90% reduced weight auto grenade launcher that I named Earthshaker that I use when ever I find an appropriate chance to do so. Like when I see Distant Thunder pop up on the map, I pull out old Earthshaker, give it a pat and whisper "Its time to shine my friend". I fast travel in and without leaving the spot I phased in on, I rain explosive destruction onto the point of interest like I'm the bastard offspring of all four horsemen of the apocalypse. And as scorched body parts scatter to all corners of the Cranberry Bog, I laugh and laugh and laugh, knowing that the Bog isn't red from the cranberries, but from the fine red mist I blanketed it with. Then I collect my 30 cap reward (which doesn't cover the cost of my fast travel) 7 fusion cells and a plan for cushioned raider legs and I think to myself "Worth it." But with the easy to obtain ammo converter, I worry that people are probably going to be feeding those 40mm grenades into the converter now instead of gift wrapping them in brown paper bags for old Earthshaker to find and force feed down the throats of the Appalachian abominations that roam my world. I was here first after all. This land belongs to me! (Oh boy, somebody sided with the raiders!) 
---
For now I'll hold out hope that my fellow vault dwellers will continue to deem those 40mm grenades far too heavy to carry back to camp and leave them for the guy who wears his five star Demolition Expert perk card like a badge of honor. And remember my friends, "The Torgue corporation appreciates your business."
---
I'm currently building a stealth commando/medic build whose gonna be running a full set of solar armor with full health. Got me a medic fixer and handmade already. It's super fun! Its killing me not having the jetpack though lmfao I love it so much 😭😭😭
---
What you mean we can't mod the game? Yes we can?
---
They should give us survival mode back with a mixture of your suggestions and the system of Fo4 survival mode, harder penalties for drugs and rad away and all meds should be much harder available. They can remove the food / drink system from adventure mode, so that the grunts can do their sbq event without being disturbed...
---
i had this vision of radmonkeys throwing irradiated poop at me
---
Please Bethesda add this post to the game
---
I do have a few, some farmed some bought at max caps in vending machines. Explosive flamer is fun since it’s super quiet and enemies burning is cool (I think they actually enhanced the burn animation in recent patch), but it breaks so fast and fuel isn’t easy to craft, so the only time i use it is for ‘set world on fire’ weekly. Explosive lasers break equally fast, and only do tickle damage to SBQ, far less effective than hm, fixer and heavy weapons. Gat plasma is good if you stand on higher ground and rain explosives on a crowd, other than that if something jumps in front of you you insta melt yourself. Tesla basically function like an explosive shotgun with rifle perks, works great when you use it with lever action etc. It’s fun to play with them occasionally but what’s currently in game is more than enough to handle any situations more effectively when you get a good roll.
---
Yea, the effects really need to be balanced out, but other than that, it's a really good concept.
---
I know that. And i'm saying it should be capped at 30.
---
&gt; As such, they can go two ways; remove that aspect or build a system of robust, immersive, gameplay enhancing hunger/thirst mechanics. I’d prefer to see the latter—which would certainly include some of your suggestions—I just don’t think it’s realistic.
---
Exactly. The concept of "softcore survival" just does not look like a good idea, it is a case of trying to please everyone, and ending up pleasing no one, which seems to be a common issue with the game in general. It might be better to have no survival elements, than pointless survival elements that do not add meaningful challenge or decision making. The suggested solution of making the meters drain slower would not fix the latter, as most players can already easily hoard way more food and water than they can consume, it would just mean *less* of a bad gameplay element. And I suspect rebalancing the game to make the survival actually matter (which would likely involve significantly nerfing the availability of resources and especially the ability to easily farm them infinitely, making death much more punishing, and other changes) would be very unpopular among the existing player base, a lot more than the removal of hunger and thirst.
---
Yeah I've almost got a solar set done lol all I need is a chest and left arm each with chameleon and vanguard
---
Didn't think I'd get much use out of it but hopefully I will with public teams
---
Just roll one decent secret service chest and keep it on favourites, it's like 7 carry weight but if you have ultra light on the solar chest I figure it balances out, my ultralight secret service chest is like 1
---
Why post it on here tho? Changes are Bethesda not going to look at all the suggestion posts even if they did it would be like once a week. Why not just send it to them directly or the game's official forum? Something tell me that gets more attention than reddit even tho it has less userbase.
---
Not officially. And even then, only one platform supports mods, which are all only client-side.
---
If you have 1st and thus unlimited scrap space it's probably a good idea to plunk one down as early as possible.  Mid-game you are going to need a LOT of screws.  You'd have a small jump start if you were collecting these from go with the collectron.
---
Daily quests award scrip.
---
If you scroll all the way to the right, in the "misc" tab there's actually a fast travel mat! This can only be used in workshops, sadly, but it's very handy when popping back to collect your materials.
---
You know what would be way better is having your challenges appear as quests. They fucked that one up pretty bad
---
cool thanks.
---
I have already bought the plans for the fixer
---
i'm having a blast with this combo lol
---
You made this? You're incredibly talented and Bethesda should hire you! You're creative and invested in making the game better in ways they haven't even imagined. Great job!
---
Hey! Don't take away my immersion, man!
---
I never went into nuke zones until CSA came out..
---
I think that’s a good one, not only would it be pretty difficult to get, but the perks are mostly only useful to lore backed reasons! (Maybe dial it back a bit on some of them though, their values are a little high, I think heavy weapons one is fine, but maybe just a 50% reduced weight for all items.
---
Thats actually why I'm making this build! Im ridiculously hyped on public teams. One of my favorite things to do right next to queen and camp building is helping out newer players. I want a build that I can let other people shine while I sit back and support them. But still do enough damage to absolutely melt everything when I need to.
---
Having to sacrifice some of your limited perks to make the game less frustrating isn't great game design.
---
&gt;Most low health builds cant use power armor because the serendipity perk DOES NOT WORK IN POWER ARMOR.
---
I would like to contest this point - between the flat damage reduction of Power Armor combined with Emergency Protocols on your chest armor, a low health build is *extremely* tanky. If you want to make a case against low health builds, I recommend you warn about poison basically being the bane of our existence as users have to react very quickly to counteract it, whereas higher health builds have much more time to use healing items.
---
Otherwise, great guide. Very nice write-up and should be very useful for anyone wanting to try out Junkies. Thanks for this.
---
Yup, I just got into the gold grind and for me it will take over a year to get the base set of SS armor and t-65 and that it without any mods.  I have a full time job and family and only a limited amount of time each week to play.  And now they are talking about the seasons thing, I read somewhere it could take plus/minus 200 hours to do a season.  They are pretty much killing the game for the casual player, which is sad  because I really like 76, bugs and all.  I even bought FO 1st when wastelanders came out but if everything is going  to be behind some reasonable gate from here on out I will probably move on to something else when my FO 1st sub ends...
---
Well thats your opinion and thats okay! I personally hope that never happens and think its a stupid idea.
---
Making a useless complaint post about complaint posts.  I assume you were going for irony here?
---
Every single thing possible in this game has been discussed 900 times over. I'd be shocked if you searched for something and could not find it.
---
Why would you need any kind of metric at all? Just to create a 3 column overview with different colours?!
---
People/factions are what they are, if they are good or bad should be your personal opinion.
---
Yeah how come console players can text chat but we can't on pc? What happened to pc master race. 76 on pc had never text chat for a long time now
---
Bugfixes.
---
I doubt the Over-encumbered Respawn Bug will be fixed, but I really hope the Fast Travel Bug is fixed. If we're *really* lucky, maybe Flamers will even work with Friendly Fire! 😱
---
But yeah I am, and always will be, more excited about Bethesda fixing **old bugs** than over any other content.
---
Are there any photo quests besides those from the overseer?
---
I won't be grouping because there is no way for me to communicate with others still. Randomly grouping with randoms with no communication doesn't sound fun to me.
---
Need a damn server text chat for all systems.
---
Worth noting for gramps and punk. If you dont like the hairstyle...put a wig on them
---
It’s nitpicking, but I see “control vs anarchy” being a more accurate alignment scale than good vs evil. Pretty much every faction is a nice shade of grey. 
---
Ok, maybe not the responders or those cultists... but the rest are grey.
---
Yeah, maybe have options to build a legendary version of any piece, It would suck having to use a raider torso just because I dont have a X01 torso with the same effect.
---
I like magic better,.
---
from my understanding the amount of food and water a meal replenishes is based on it's location in form lists, so they only have to adjust each list, not each food.
---
Coulda sworn that you already receive 90% sales from vending machines already. Overall i think these are some cool ideas especially the Mothman and Foundation bonuses
---
Exactly. I love playing this event solo or with help it’s a hoot. And the ore is a nice bonus in Excavator PA.
---
130 flowers? That’s not wery much
---
" I'm gonna kill her however fast I want."
---
That is the attitude of a dickhead.
---
Looks like the stuff to make explosive bait
---
Yeah a medics build should be a lot more helpful now :) I don't use it much so you might know better than I do, but I find that the effect kind of scales with the damage done 
---
A medics shotgun healed me a lot, but that was a long time ago, maybe they nerfed it, the VATS unknown on the other hand does barely anything so it might be worth testing that out
---
I think I've still got a medics 50% Crit damage shotgun I've been meaning to test out too
---
Ward is eviler than any of the Raiders. every day he asks you to go and retrieve water saw from someone who happened to steal it, not just any water saw that you can find in the waste, the exact one that some random person has. Ward needs it ASAP and that it Foundation would collapse without it. once you make your way to the person who has it, they needed the water saw to save their loved one from gangrene or to help a kid or something. If you kill them and bring it back to Ward, he says that sorry that you had to kill someone for it, but we will keep this water saw with the dozens of other water saws that we have. you never know when we might need 40 of them.
---
It's a small bonimus to your junk stockpiles. It's not going to eliminate the need to farm specific junk, but if you return to your CAMP regularly and empty it out each time, you'll have noticeably more junk and helps with the harder to acquire stuff.
---
No sounds like he could use some gamer shoes to up his game.
---
So you raise an interesting point.  I was active on the official forums long before I came here.  I never liked the style of reddit and it still feels clunky to me.  But, it seems like this place does actually get much more attention from the dev team and community managers than the official forums which people on the official forums are not always happy about.  
---
If you look at the nukacrypt dev tracker there are way more posts of them responding to reddit stuff as opposed to the official forums.
---
Lol having something even worse doesn’t mean this grind isn’t abysmal
---
That thing is so tall it gets blocked by trees and structures easily, so the only threat is its pukes and screams. Get a heavy gun, keep some distance and you can solo it without problems. The scream attack only works when you’re too close to it.
---
I second that. The biggest problem with pc in both destiny 2 and fallout 76 is the hackers
---
#Bethesda should definitely have a gander at this
---
Yeah you take a 10% “tax” to Todd when someone buys something. Idk why OP is talking about.
---
I listened to Rose's station yesterday - the robot is bonkers.
---
Why will it take you that long? It's only going to take me two weeks for base SS armor, two hours a day gets me max daily gold and usually I get more treasury notes so I can just chill the next day
---
This is genius my friend. 
---
I really hope they see this!!!
---
Needs an ultacite arm with a JP for maximum flex
---
Congrats! Also, do you ever run Revenant? Your Mysterious Savior can proc it and you'll be a death machine for the next 2 minutes.
---
Awesome achievement!!
---
This would not be a really good system to implement in the game. Go over to MMO-Champion and look at the World of Warcraft: Shadowlands posts bitching about the system Blizzard is putting into the game. And it is only 4. 
---
They should just add these as faction rewards with certain ones being polar opposites like Raiders/Foundation and such. 
---
And is The Enclave really evil though? I mean the former incarnation of it certainly is but would we, as players do the same thing like releasing Scorchbeasts and such just for power/revenge/etc.?
---
the Fatman and auto grenade launcher are only viable if you have a two-shot legendary version, from my experience everything else feels like wet paper against a wall
---
I remember waiting for the beta to start, we were all wanting to be in a first responder role. We thought the responders was a faction and we'd be in it. Nope. It's every player for themselves! It's you CAN ROLEPLAY as a responder, but that's about it
---
Or the dreaded trade glitch
---
Really like the concept of this idea hopefully BGS can implement if 💚
---
What tips and guides need to be posted? Nothing new has really come out. Just search for the info you need. It's all been discussed hundreds of times
---
They just can't handle your ball'n swag
---
oops, maybe up to 100% from 90% then
---
It does nothing for the game economy if it isn’t tradable, in fact, the market is currently over saturated with Duped Legacies, and the only items of Value other than those legacies are ultra rare outfits. Caps are near useless and there’s no item-item trade system, them adding GB weapons to the pool could stabilize the economy.
---
Isn't that just because you're in "Show Offers Only" from your last trade and need to press "Show All" again? Since I started doing that, I haven't had this problem a single time.
---
200%*
---
That event solo is incredibly easy, it takes 2 minutes max as a stealth commando and you don't have to shoot any robot because they don't see you. Use scorchbeasts stakes or any food from  scorchbeasts instead of stimpacks. Watch angry turtle video if you are interested.
---
Hahahaha i was thinking it must be a big shock to them seeing me
---
I just hope that far fewer are protected by the game than settlers &amp; raiders so I can shoot them in the face to death..
---
The only reason we call them "magic" effects is because a Youtuber named Angry Turtle described and popularized the "feature" in an in-depth video and that's what he called the bugged damage increase. 
---
It's not a term of endearment, it's just the vernacular chosen by the guy who publicized it.
---
If they annoy you, it will definitely seem like that's all there is sometimes.  If you hang here, it's best to learn to scroll past those as breezily as possible.
---
No sir. My source is a video from Angry Turtle. If you ahvnt seen his videos check them out. The guy knows everything about fallout it seems.
---
I'm pretty sure you're right. I've got the fixer and handmade and while they don't heal much PER crit, I crit so often and quickly that it more than makes up for it. Lord only knows how much you'd heal someone with a medics Fatman or something 🤣🤣🤣
---
they should add a food preservation mechanic similar to making stabilized flux so that people will actually make and sell more complicated recipes. noone really cooks because either your ingredients will spoil before you make it back to camp, or you spend 120 caps FTing to get the ingredients quickly enough, then even if you do cook to food, its will just spoil in a vendor in  before anyone buys it in time. 
---
it would add more depth too food without removing spoilage and would give us another thing to do
---
Yeah I think the idea was it would be to tanky in PA with both the 50% damage reduction torso mod AND serendipity.
---
You know, for someone complaining about the lack of tips, guides and content about the game in the sub, your post is oddly devoid of tips, guides and content about the game.
---
Curious.
---
Nicely done mate, I still have some way to go yet until I have a set of SS I'm happy with. 
---
How is the T-65? I've heard conflicting things.
---
it's not like there are tens of thousands of foods in the game....even if you had to go in and adjust numbers for 1000 things, so what... how long would that take? an hour at most?
---
Was it worth the grind for you? Would you do it again with another character?
---
That is a good point :) I just got my Fixer a while ago, Prime Automatic AA 50% Crit 15% Crit Meter, I love it so much
---
I hit 70s with every shot on the queen and about 200 with a crit, 2/3 Crits per ap bar
---
Same with the first several shots in VATS with ranged weapons. Enemies are straight up shrugging off thousands of initial damage, despite the impact sound and damage numbers being displayed.
---
The network code that handles hit detection and damage needs some major attention.
---
I run mostly out of PA because I like to zip around on a jet pack and bash stuff in the face. The PA jet pack seems kinda broke to me. But for nuke zones and those times I want to be iron man I throw on the PA no problem.
---
I'd say yes and no
---
The grind for the rep and gold for each item I'd only do once
---
username checks out
---
I don’t think the gold grind for the secret service gear is really that bad, you do 3 dailies that take about an hour at tops for 9 treasury notes, and you can do some events to get more.  
---
I mean, it’s not like there’s anything else to do in the game. I personally think the rep grind is far worse.  Let’s say they changed it to no cap or a one week grind.  Then what?  You don’t even need the gear, there is no end game content. Nothing challenging was added to the game with wastelanders.  
---
You’re effectively just farming for extra, unnessesary DR/ER at that point.
---
It has the best stats of all PA and when I started using it, its fairly decent I'd say whether or not it outperforms Strangler during a Queen I'll have to test but since it got nerfed pretty heavily I'd say T-65 is better overall
---
As a stealth rifleman, Instigating is where it's at for me. I don't mess around with bloodied or junkies builds as I prefer full health and "clean" builds. Though i do love my mutations.
---
Once a character is deleted it’s deleted. I do not know of a way to restore a character once deleted. 
---
When you uninstall the game your info is still stored for that game- so when you reinstall anywhere on any Xbox you can play with your characters with no problems
---
JP?
---
I think Eybiss is right. This has never been an issue for damage output. However, if you are looking at your weapon damage while you equip and un equip, it may show something lower. Dont fret it tho, the damage is there.
---
Ah I do know of that trick, I put that in my bloodied guide I made awhile back. Sadly though my Endurance is really low so I only have enough room for fireproof. 
---
(Although in my experience the Mysterious Stranger has been less then helpful when reviving me... He’ll revive me every time when I try to kill myself or when I accidentally fall off my brothers cliff camp while building it, but whenever I go down in combat he’s nowhere to be seen... I swear he does it on purpose.)
---
I mean going to the full meal thing they should have it like eat a death claw steak and say a fugi soup with a nuka cola it gives a hidden so boost or sonethin. Therefore people will try to do different combos of items for best effects and stuff like that or have it where if u eat any combo they all give u a do boost
---
Well it is a question post it purpose is to gather answer about a question. Now if it was a discussion post there would be not lacking those things pretty easy to figure out that not supposed to make you curious at all
---
That globe is not canon, lol.
---
Grind isn’t a good substitute for endgame content, hell Wastelanders had like only 3 side quest lines. There could be an actual endgame if Bethesda made true side quests instead of the fetch/kill quests that litter this game,
---
try cannibal perk, works for me :p well with food problem atleast
---
Thats almost the same roll as my Anti armor one! Mine has 25%ap cost instead of the 15% meter though. I've been trying to collect them lol. So far I've got an AA, a TS a Zealots and the Medics one. I put my prime receiver on the Zealots fixer and OH BOY. 
---
I haven't moved all my points into perception yet, still only have rank 1 of each commando perk and ill still do 120-150ish damage a crit on the queen. Its gonna be lethal once its done lol ive been collecting small guns bobs, ballistic bock and different chems to see how high I can get it while still being full health.
---
Great question. Yes they stack. Alcohol being in its own category. I usually run around with my +6 strength whiskey or +3 strength +75 HP Vodka/ Mountain Honey, and if im looking for that extra beast mode damage, I pop a psychobuff (Psycho chem not buffout) and that just puts the power attack damage of my grog axe over the top.
---
Berserker/sneak, it's something very unique and since sneak does scale with your armors weight berseker (no armor) will make sense for such a build. You could also use junkie as an alternative but these weapons are very expensive.
---
pvp could be fine across the board if they’d just remove the broken ass legacy weapons that they removed from loot tables. “oh hey let’s stop giving these out bc they’re broken as shit but if you wanna go spend $300 on ebay for one, go ahead” lmao
---
You can also fast travel for free to the location of people on your friend's list whether or not they are on your current team.  So if you want you can have a team of any size really, coordinating actions through Discord.
---
Someone has killed them earlier and it takes awhile to load them in their proper condition is a big place like that.
---
Great point, another benefit of the party boy perk, boosting charisma while you shop.
---
Lmaooo
---
Love it!! Now add some quests and a vending machine a la Ever Upwards and you got it!!
---
Maybe add Blood Eagles and Unstoppable's as factions too!!
---
Yes! There are hundreds of „To the guy who...“ posts - my personal favorite. /s
---
Especially with the Abandoned Bog town - the natural spawn in point is very far away from the resource generators.
---
And the kicker, you are in PA lol
---
since the current trend seems to be removal of Atoms not directly purchased.. Id say its unlikely..
---
Wow you did more thinking than Bethesda. Too bad they are even too lazy to steal this or even use it if you gave it to them
---
I managed to get one with an on/off switch on it. And I've used it too.....miracle! :D
---
Thank you for all your help
---
yeah I was surprised that the SS armor jetpack works without any kind of power requirement while the PA jetpack can drain your cores really fast.
---
Gotcha, I dunno, there's been areas I've entered and without firing a single shot, they seem to start chasing me down, firing at me immediately
---
This was the purpose of the post, to just get it out there how fun the build is.
---
Nope. Melted her plenty of times with less than 1000 5mm from a minigun on a private server.
---
A guy dud testing with a lvl 95 behemoth and there was a 3 dmg difference in hits taken between the t65 and sh. That was without protocols or lone wanderer or anything. So the difference is very minimal
---
I like the sh better, but solo because I earned mine and have the jet pack arm lol. Without the jet pack arm it really didn't make much difference
---
I’m back friend if you want it
---
I shot her square in the face with an AA missile launcher with full demo expert just to test the numbers  yesterday. It did 1.
---
You're welcome! Happy adventuring dweller!
---
Huh, interesting
---
Really doesn't even matter.  Best would be all Secret service, and then maybe a mix of leather and metal to max DR and ER.  I put together a full set of just whatever pieces I came across which is a mix of combat, scout and leather.  It's more about the percentage reduction than the stats.  Most of my pieces as crap one and 2 stars but Im able to tank the imposter solo anyways.
---
in wow you really need to commit to one of the new factions though, with this system you have a active relationship with each faction and can change your direct affiliation often
---
I believe this works with the Chinese stealth suit if you break it and don’t repair. You’ll still get the rad resistance but the armor being broken allows you to get the berserker bonus.
---
Thats weird. 
---
Stupid question, but do you have all the sneak perks equipped?
---
Surely cosmetics aren't worth 20+ by themselves, I personally think that if they had the chance, they should put around 600 or 700 atoms in each bundle to even put the cost and further justify customers buying the bundles.
---
Neat idea.  All of the factions should get faction quests evenly rather than giving more to the BOS though access to special equipment would be ok.  With respect to faction specific perks they could have faction specific perk cards which - you would get them as well as additional slots as you gain reputation and for completing certain events.
---
Its not about shoting her straight on tho, it has something to do with missing her and the splash damage working or shoting her in a specific part like her belly. I dunno.
---
That's awesome :) that's the roll I was looking for but after weeks of posting and finally getting the offer for this one I just said ok I'll take it lmao
---
I'm saving up to bundle it with some other stuff and hopefully get the 25% less ap version
---
I couldn't believe how long it took, I honestly think I overpaid but whatever you know? I just don't see that many people using AA so it was surprising
---
My offer that finally got one was:
---
[XB1] W: AA50V25LVC The Fixer H: BE15V Legacy Tesla Rifle, AAE90 The Fixer, Plan: Marine Armour Helmet, Plan: Treasure Hunter Outfit, Plan: Insurgent Hat, Deathclaw &amp; Crazy Man Masks
---
Calmex is a wonder lmao I usually forget to use it but when I actually remember it's crazy
---
people are already buying it without atoms.. why would they add them now?
---
If you consider how expensive Power Armor skins can be the prices aren't actually that outrageous.
---
how could you tell
---
Great idea! To bad that Bethesda didn't develop the "Order of Mysteries" as a full fledged faction, because I would rather see that under "Good Factions" than "Vault 76".
---
I was thinking so, but maybe I need to look again... Might be something stupid like I unlocked them but didn't equip em. Who knows
---
Yeah. Now without the ability to place the jet pack on an arm it comes down to which you like the look of better. And about getting the mods, definitely easier to get mods for the 65
---
That's true. I wish they wrote it on the perk card though lol. Would have saved me some perk points.
---
Nope, magical effects are just for fast fire rate weapons (above 200 fire rate) and any shotgun in vats (including harpoon gun with flechettes or tesla shotgun).
---
If your in pc shout at me. I am not a good lvl but I have been blessed by other players when I was low lvl and now I help when ever I can.
---
Yeah when I was lvl 3 -5 I logged in and was immediately attacked and it left a bad taste in my mouth. But I have to say it is rare to see that kind of behavior anymore
---
Another benefit of berserker is that he get God rolls very cheap since Noone really likes berserker
---
You are definitely not wrong, that 20% health bar on a bloodied is way harder to chip away than the 20% of a junkies. However, that \~80% wiggle room is just something I prefer. 
---
The poison is always an issue for sure. Even at full health if you dont watch that health bar, the mierlurks will dissolve you lol.
---
Is there a cap on treasury notes?  Just hold onto the notes?
---
My main has over 800 energy resistance and i can most definitely tell the difference between my other toon that only has 450 energy resistance. I think most people that make up these numbers have no idea what they are talking about
---
I'm not a fan of the "have 6 matching pieces" part of the idea as that would just add another level of hell to grind... (imagine having to grind exact copies of bloodied scout armor including its mask for its effect to work lol). Instead they should just introduce a similar legendary system like we already have for normal armor but with its own or adjusted copied perks like each piece adding +50 carry weight or some damage reduction.
---
True, with all the right defensive perks, low-health builds are a whole lot sturdier than one might otherwise think. But that's not what I meant: The funny/frustrating thing is that they can die to the most random little things when RNG looks askance at you and all those saving rolls fail. The thing to take away here is basically to run around with as little scrap as possible - always a good idea anyway - and just roll with the punches.
---
If you're asking 'why will season take you 200ish hours,' Bethesda said each score reward should take between 1-2 hours to complete depending on if its an earlier or later challenge on the score board, and since there's 100 spots...
---
This is the thing. I'm fine with being able to one shot most enemies with a shotgun up close but you should have to have all the shotgun perk cards plus other damage boosting perks in a bloodied build. Hopefully they don't get completely nerfed and make shotguns useless.
---
I can only imagine the amount of workload that will put on the servers by having interactive options in each camp. Don't get me wrong I'd love to have this feature. **However, if that means the servers will suffer and gameplay will suffer then count me out.**
---
It really is easier, my T-65 is fully modded and I thought I still had the arms and helmet to get
---
My.helmet had like 7 mods already which is odd
---
There are those posts and then there are posts about people complaining about those posts.
---
I agree, grind isn’t a good substitute for end game content, and since there is no end game content, it’s not like it’s time gating you from anything.  It’s not “Oh shit, I can’t do this raid or complete this quest if I don’t have secret service gear”  If the grind feels abysmal, then don’t do it, you don’t need to.  You’ll likely earn enough treasury notes just doing events over time.  
---
Speeding up the grind would make the market even worse. If it was easier for everyone to get to the end game gear, then people wouldn’t need to buy gear from anyone else except to use as scrip.  Making the gear tradable would only exacerbate the situation.
---
But the thing is though then that would basically nullify the system and basically just grant you the powers of each one. You might as well just make them all rep grinds with perks as you level up at that point.
---
The reason there is a punisher mechanic in WoW is because of the two combat abilities you get. They do not want them to become 4 new abilities for each class and an additional 4 new ones for each spec.
---
its a possibility. Given Bethesda's history with updates and whatnot, I'm extremely worried about how the upcoming difficulty overhaul will affect the game.
---
I use whatever. It almost doesn't matter as long as it is 5x Troubleshooter
---
That was a cringy read ngl
---
I mean, they nerfed the shit out of explosives when they "fixed" the explosive legendary effect. Now no one ever uses them for serious fights, and AFAIK there aren't any plans to bring back explosive builds. I'd hate for shotguns to get the same treatment, but it wouldn't surprise me.
---
Yeah the helm comes with all the mods. And I don't think any of the arms are really worth the hassle
---
I still call them "magic" weapons, too. :-P
---
Because the way they melt things is truly magical, and it is a very specific word usage for a very specific problem. "Limb damage bug" makes it sound like limb damage isn't working - which is not the problem here, and it's only one of several effects affected by this. And "broken" is... rather unspecific and can apply to lots of other things, especially in this game. :-(
---
No we also have "ShOuT oUt tO..."
---
Does not even have to be static set bonuses but rather mods that you can put in
---
The bundles went on sale not too long ago, for about $12 USD each and $18 USD together, IIRC. Having Atoms as part of those bundles would make it less likely they’d do discounts like that, I think.
---
Oh no doubt, bloodied is the undisputed damage dealer, and we know highest damage in PVP wins. Especially because it seems no matter how much DR you stack in this game it never counteracts the player damage that much. Im a long time fallout fan, and I love to play the game for the PVE. I think PVP being such a new component of the game has a long way to go.
---
My biggest problem with PvP is I always seem to get players that are damn near unkillable. Like I don’t have bad weapons it’s just some perk loadouts, with some aid buffs, are literally unkillable
---
While duping is indeed a problem, and they seriously need to work on it, I dont think thats why there is a storage limit. I think the storage limit comes down to 2 things:  
---
1. Server stability
---
2. Fallout 1st
---
The game servers need to wipe every few hours when people leave too many goo/ash/scrap piles of dead enemies they didnt finish looting. Those never go away. Eventually the server gets overloaded and goes into "maitenance mode" and kicks everyone out.  
---
I also think they may try and use this as a bargaining chip down the line. They sold unlimited scrap storage for $99/year and they said that other limits would soon be removed for paying players. I think this will be one of those they eventually remove or scale up for paying players.
---
It’s strange that this change renders a bunch of endurance perks completely useless(instead of just kind of useless).
---
Are they going to remove or rebalance perks that reduce hunger and thirst? What about diseases like dysentery and parasites?
---
If they can solo it with bugged weapons, great for them.  They have biggest pew pew and we are all so impressed! /a
---
They can go do that on their own time, though.  When other people spend their caps to show up, they generally expect to have a few minutes to fight her and get to loot her corpse in addition to the event rewards.  Bethesda needs to patch whatever this exploit is.
---
For my PA gunner, Mirelurk queens are the worst. The damage i receive is so huge, that an active Stimpack only slows down the rate of it. Luckily i have a Vampire's LMG that keeps me alive when shit hits the fan. 
---
But in my memory, poison wasn't always that strong, or do i mix up things? Did they change the poison damage in one of the patches? Is the extreme damage the Mirelurk queen does even poison damage?
---
Well, I also tested 2 50 cals, one with explosive, to see if there's a difference and the explosive definitely did more damage per hit. My guess is she has something like the dense armor effect so it does work but does very little.
---
Completely disagree, the Gauss Minigun can’t compete with the B2525 Fixer or BE handmade or even a Medics minigun. It would just diversify the market and hopefully lower the prices on the only valuables on the market.
---
I can’t remember what the event is called but it’s the one at the airport where waves of scorched come in. i did that event and got a lot of pure flux crating mats too
---
It doesn't increase with level.
---
I can make you some if you need but I won't be one for quite a few hours as I am working.
---
Heck, I wish regular power armor had "you can run and even when Overcumbered as long as you have AP, you can sprint but it costs additional power core usage" so yes technically you have "unlimited carry weight" on power armor but it means constant AP use/core consumption
---
aw man i would but i’m on ps4. sorry bro
---
Okay thanks if I don’t sort it by then I’d definitely like the help.
---
BOS all day especially the outcast chapter.
---
Fun fact : The same voice actress does both Rose and Fuzzy Brenda.
---
And this is why I still wear my prototype hazmat suit in nuke zones.  400+ lvls and have never put on a PA suit. I have the Chinese suit but I lose my stealth more often in that suit than even my hazmat suit.
---
 Not sure if the css is broke or what but it does not act very stealthy for me.
---
The other thing they need to do is a group tag for these things so I do not have to hit every single thing in order to get XP/loot if someone I am grouped up with has. The Area Loot mechanic that SWTOR and WoW have would be nice too.
---
Yeah someone else told me they think energy resistance doesn't have a cap so who the hell really knows. I do know my energy guns dont do as much to PA so ig it must be true
---
you can only have the benefits of one faction at a time though
---
A few days ago, I followed a level 3 player around for an hour or so, hiding using the Chinese Stealth Suit. I acted like the mysterious stranger, giving a helping hand when the guy was having trouble with difficult enemies (lvl 5 super mutants in this case). Also dropped about 30 random plans by his feet when he was using the workbench which included ultracite PA plans and fashnacht plans.
---
I don’t think he knew someone was following him until the end when I revealed myself and gave a thumbs up and heart emote.
---
The funniest part about the people who cry "But I cant do less damage, my weapon does x damage and that kills the SBQ in 2 shots"  
---
Well, maybe you dont need a SBQ kill? If you are seriously that OP that you have everything decked out to the most efficient kill machine ever, why are you here? You can be doing 99.999999999% of what the game offers but you go out of your way to kill an enemy meant for everyone to get rewards you wont even pick up. At that point you ARE being a douche and probably should just move to a private world so the people who want to enjoy the game can continue to do so.
---
Lol  i can imagine MODUS as a radio DJ
---
that sounds like bad luck to me. i would try it again. just make sure you are completely in the blast zone because the ones that spawn outside of it don’t drop those mats.
---
How were you getting back to your workshops if you didn’t fast travel to them? Are you one of those purists who runs to every location? Serious question. Trying to figure out how you’re only discovering this now!
---
I used to have two flags flying beside each other at my camp and they were often waving in complete opposite directions
---
I’m not, it’s base damage. Turned on the numbers and cried. Roughly 4-5 damage per shot while in the air, more on the ground and more if I charge it up.
---
If you end up needing some just send me a message on xbox and let me know you're from reddit.  GT is same as name on here.  I rarely check reddit once im off my computer for the day.
---
I was mulling over putting things like factions specific perk cards, how to gain and lose rep and factions specific allies on the chart, but I didn't want to face people with a wall of text haha.
---
now i’m mad he didn’t help me
---
Nice one thanks 😊
---
I'm with you that it isn't great game design, but that part of the argument is more to do with a lack of being able to swap between card builds with ease. There is a mod for this on PC, but that is not the entire player base. Sure the player can swap perk cards anytime, but its cumbersome and isn't anywhere near precise, even with a mouse. I understand that perk layout saving is coming in the future, but we'll be 2 years into the games lifespan and getting a QoL feature that should have been there since launch.
---
Ok, I won't skip the dialog. I hope it works.
---
pvp needs its own server away from everyone who doesn't want pvp. end of story.
---
You are kidding right?, P.A has hidden 42% damage reduction ,immunity to falling damage ,+ 100 carry weight with calibrated shocks (more if you use excavator), emergency protocols, enviromental resistance and many many more,i could write pages for the benefits of P.A, why make something more OP than it is in its current state?.
---
how’s berserker going for you?
---
I agree whole heartedly!    Even with perk slots wasted on food and drink, food takes up weight and stash, ingredients and dishes spoil quickly, and sates small amounts even for fancy dishes.   
---
Therefore I never bother trying to cook anything beyond single ingredients I collect on my quests and travels.
---
I like your specific ideas.
---
I noticed we get fewer but I'm still definitely in a postive ammo flow.
---
Only weird thing I've found is my explosive harpoon will not return any ammo when I sue vats but will in free aim.
---
yes they go to level 62 or whatever max level they are
---
I have a better internet connection than my buddy and I have an Xbox One X, while he does not, and he still loads in 15-20 seconds faster than me every time.
---
Yes, I picked up an Osmose kit, and a multiscope by accident . I thought I broke them down for scrap but not sure. I must have broke the game. lol
---
The reason some people get higher up is so that their ammo isn't wasted on the damned fools who constantly walk in front of your gun.
---
Ha! It’s kind of sad that putting on PA with calibrated shocks makes me encumbered.
---
for cobalt it is :) haha
---
She's not "immune" to explosive damage, just severely resistant to it. Large explosive weapons will do negligible damage to her, you will see a small amount from high ROF explosive weapons...but it's still not enough to make much difference.
---
The Fireflies in a Jar ceiling lamp :) to give my smallish outdoor camp an even more chilled and quiet vibe especially at night with only the sound of wind chimes and the Appalachia radio playing.
---
All this time eating radioactive food and I still haven’t taken one atomic dump.
---
Wow, way to shout over me. Thanks.
---
T-65 PA skin and the nightlight looks pretty good too.
---
Really. I’ll have to look into that. I mainly use VATS and rarely free aim
---
I have a character that’s a full on TANK. High health, defensive perks everywhere, Vanguard armor, Instigating and Vampire weapons. He’s indestructible and it is fun to play that way sometimes.
---
What this game needs is more currencies  please please please, give us platinum and diamond currencies, capped obviously just to render them pointless..
---
Works great for me. Pretty much not got out of it since I got it. Can do whole sbq standing in front of it grounded without being seen. Trying to go to secret service now though, will always go back to CSS for nuke zones/sbq.
---
If you want GOOD pvp with base building and an open world, try Rust. It really is what people are looking for in Fallout, but will never find. 
---
Fallout's system is built for PVE and that's the way it should stay.  PVP is horrible in Fallout even at its best.
---
Free states would sounds really fun in concept. I’d gladly camp in the mire for those hoard events
---
Vats shotgunner with some specific legendary effects are very good aswell. Very effective, cheap and easy to get The weapons and dont take up all of your perk points. But this build is based on a bug witch is a bit cheaty
---
I’m just helping the parent comment out, he was trying to think of a category. Let’s be real here, none of our asks are going into this game
---
I find my moral outrage does the most damage
---
typo it was supposed to say gay
---
Slowing down the drain meters and making it spoil slower would go a huge way towards a better food experience.  I never really got into food because of how much of a hastle it is but really want to get into food.  
---
We should be able to can and dry certain foods which would never spoil unrefrigerated and refrigeration should really extend the life otherwise.   
---
I would love to be a hunter or forager and set up shop.    
---
Incentivizing using different foods would be tricky as it would add a new layer and require some consideratio - but status effects for eating only certain food types would be neat if they increased one stat but decreased another and then add another similar to 'well rested' which gives them a boost if they get all their food groups in.
---
I really want that secret fireplace.   Guess it gives me a reason to to grind the whole thing out.
---
a sneak shotgun build sounds nice actually, what's the bug tho?
---
Which is why it doesn't work in this game.
---
Mothman faction sounds fun. Reminds me of the covenants in dark souls that are summoned in to protect certain areas. Also I just really wanna join the cult in general on my main
---
Mistress of mystery could be another minor faction too
---
expensive how?
---
crafting.. out of a vendor.. from a player vendor?
---
Search don't scroll then.
---
Probably prime 50 cal if that's a thing
---
42% damage reduction and emergency protocols ? Sentinel and Legendary perk have 75% damage reduction and 30% reduction respectively , serendipity and many other perks work on normal but not on power armor
---
+210 carry weight?  Unyielding + deep pocketed mod + high capacity back pack is 275 carry weight and you get wwr 
---
Environmental resistance? Gas masks  but that isn't an issue
---
I here you. The one downside I face is when I try to be a melee heavy gunner build. There just arent enough strength points to get what I want. I usually end up sacrificing my 3 martial artists for the 3 heavy gunner perks rank 1 then taking demolitions expert off and slapping on the armor penetration. Rifle melee complements really well though.
---
Player
---
They already announced that they are softening the survival aspects of the game previously, food in particular.  There will no longer be any negative impacts to not eating (if you dont start to lose HP and AP).  However, consuming food/water will be incentivized by buffs you get for doing as such.
---
Yeah I’m not saying he didn’t do a great job. It’s a great post and well thought out, it’s just that one perk would be insanely hard to pass up.
---
Yeah I'm not debating the validity of your build, just your point about low health builds not being able to use PA because of Serendipity.
---
probably because he has a job or other obligations and can't log in every day. people like him would have a much better time of it if the cap was weekly instead of daily, so you could hand in 140 treasury notes per week and get your 1400 gold all at once, but bethesda wants people to log in each day so they can say to their shareholders "look how many people are logging in each day! everythings fine"
---
Camp items. The cosmos stuff is to silly for my taste. I have a berserker build so the ghilli stuff is useless
---
this same thing is happening to me.  all other keys work, i can bring up pip boy with tab, i can bring up map with m
---
it's just WSAD stop working from time to time, i can even jump when forward or backward stops working so i know i'm not locked up, or wireless keyboard isn't connected.
---
i quickly turned on my xbox controller last time and i can turn but not move forward with controller too.
---
any ideas?
---
It's all good. I was just joking around anyways lol.  Doesn't matter who you are, I'll die in a puddle all the same.  At least I will try...last time I did it, it took a lot of tries.  The line between going down for a revive and just flat out killing yourself is a finer one than you would think.
---
I stopped interacting with the cooking aspect quite awhile ago, I only eat prepackaged food that I find, that way I never have to deal with spoilage
---
Crikey is it patch 20 tomorrow then?
---
I get away with just 1 point in Fireproof, maybe that will be enough for you too.
---
If you use some specific legendary effects on the shotgun it does 3 maybe 4 Times the damage. This only works in vats. There is some videos on Youtube and probably older posts about it here. There is rumours that it Will be patched next update tho. Check angry turtle video about it on Youtube. And as a side tip, shotguns and suppressors dont match.
---
I shot him a ton, but he just kept going ham on the stupid blackberry bushes
---
This.  I can't finish a steak by myself now!  But I need to eat 5 to not be hungry anymore?  and then I'm hungry again in like 15 minutes.  Don't worry, I'll eat the other stuff I cooked earlier, nope its spoiled!
---
I applaud you for your work good sir! You are truly doing the work of the almighty Atom. With a few tweaks this could easily make Fallout 76 one of the best games out there, draw in more players, and make it last for even more years to come. Bethesda needs to take a serious look at this and people need to upvote this so they do!
---
While people may be missing out on choices like you said they could still play their cards right and side with both like you’re able to now then you don’t miss out on those items specifically. Hell rn you can side only with the raiders and get both rewards that you mentioned and say to hell with the settlers. There isn’t the same thing even now when siding with the settlers so that alone shows they need to add something atleast. My problem with this whole system though is it is so unbelievably in immersive as the two factions keep complaining about the other but somehow the only real path Bethesda puts you down is to be friends with both and none of the dialog changes through out all of this. If the raiders were to see you walking around talking to ward I’m sure they would be a bit more pissed about your loyalty than they are at all. These two factions are polarizing or atleast should be and what we got was shit. I wish bethesda just allowed some other 3rd party company that had experience with MMO style games produce fallout 76, because then the game wouldn’t be crippled by devs who don’t have a clear vision on what the game should be and maybe the the game wouldn’t be crippled by one of the shittiest engines I’ve seen.
---
I’ve run it 3 or 4 times this week on public servers.
---
As I understand it, you're not far off. The SBQ doesn't have specific defenses against explosive damage. Instead, this seems to be a hitbox problem for things like missile launchers and other weapons with large explosions.
---
The fact that weapons like the Gauss rifle or rifles with the Explosive legendary effect only deal negligible additional damage also has to do with the way the SBQ's considerable defenses reduce the relatively small damage from the additional hit down to nearly nothing.
---
Also great if you launch nukes at all.  I don't do silos all that often but a full set of troubleshooters makes it a breeze when I do.
---
I just had my first encounter with the Colossus Wendigo in the Cranberry Bog and he was stuck in the trees so it was easy to take him down.
---
actually the gauss minigun *can* compete with the fixer / handmade / minigun. it's a very good weapon, especially if you get a bloodied one, i am doing 450 damage with just bloodied, nerd rage and adrenal reaction, that's not including adrenaline stacks or emergency protocols (because i still need to get them on my t 65). i also herd that the longer you fire it, the more damage it does because it's a gauss weapon, i don't know if that's true but if it is, it is very good for targets like wendigo colossus and SBQ
---
It’s still around. I did it a few times over the weekend. It’s on a timer rotation and can’t be triggered by going there.
---
Personally, I’m excited to find more unlisted weapon balancing changes. Even though a lot of the changes are questionable nerfs that I don’t understand. It keeps me busy at least!
---
Fusion Cores 🙂
---
Should be the same as pooping.  Not in the game.
---
This is the stuff i want to see but we will probaly never get
---
It's on the public event rotation, you can't just activate it.
---
Yeah if your using an explosive one that's it I'm betting. 
---
I have a cute quad 33 vats with flechette (magic shotgun effects kick in) and that beauty is giving me back harpoon whether it's vats or not. Just not getting the near dozen a pop I saw in some videos lol.
---
But with my explosive one, I find if I free aim most the time and mix in a vats shot here and there I'm still getting back more than I'm dishing out. ;)
---
Supply drops can be buggy., especially if the server is somewhat laggy to begin with. Additionally, there can be a problem where they get stuck in the scenery on their way to the drop-off point, although I've only ever reliably seen that behaviour at the monorail elevator.
---
Yep, a little. A few times I've fast traveled down to the fight only to arrive and she's already dead. It doesn't happen all the time though, usually it's just a normal fight.
---
If you pay more than 1c per you are getting ripped off. Unless it's plasma or fusion cores
---
I have a sneaky Berserker rifleman. It’s only like level 54 but with a bunch of sneak perks, it’s really not hard at all. I died a lot in the mid levels but now that I have my proper gear set up, it’s really powerful. It’s also made it very clear to me how goddamn strong sneak builds are in general. The damage output is crazy.
---
Definitely send a request! We’ll get it done!
---
the problem is that you can still only hand in 20 per day so it would still take x amount of days before you could buy anything with those stockpiled notes
---
I know I have a very VERY simple fix for the God mode bug. Re add survival and implement requiring new characters so there are no legacy weapons around allowing for easy access to god mode and disable PVP entirely on adventure. Then people who like PvP would be able to play with others who like it on survival and god mode for the most part is gone. If they remove the seek revenge option on survival and just require time before respawn then no more god mode. Easy as that, but you know bethesda won’t see this comment and this won’t happen but that’s all they really need to do.
---
Good to know. Thank you. What’s the magic shotgun effect?
---
also make sure your weapon has a silencer. a loud gun will give away your position quickly.
---
fuzzy brenda is my spirit animal
---
I want to see bars and restaurants (as camps) and this completely removes the RP element that some people expertly pull off creating such places and selling their goods. Considering all the money they must make off of cosmetics it makes zero sense to make the changes they intend to do as it should cut into their sales. I would hope the almighty dollar would in this case bring them to their senses and have them listen to the masses and their alternative proposed changes instead.
---
I’m excited for it as well. I actually like the majority of the camp items, skins, and other rewards. I’m just curious as to how slow the grind will actually be. But I’m optimistic. If anything, this is just an addition to what I’m already doing so it should be fine
---
I am but have to say if you think the season will entail doing something different I fear you're in for some disappointment.
---
Can’t agree more. I literally sort my aid by spoil and eat whatever is about to go bad without looking at the stats. It’s ruins the point of food in my opinion.
---
Poison damage has always been absolute ridiculous. I'm a bloodied heavy weapon PA build. I can survive pretty much anything but i fear for my life as soon as i see a venomous bug.
---
Sadly its not really controlling any damage as dupers have found ways to dupe the weapons (&amp; plans I would assume) already anyway just like every time whenever Bethesda intents to 'fix' anything dupe related. Limits aren't going to help much there as dupers will find ways around them, the only real fixes would be to either truly fix the netcode to not allow picking up stuff that isn't there or introduce ways to get godrolls without an endless amount of grind which fuels the duping market.
---
Tell me one set of armor that has 15% damage reduction per piece for radiation damage except P.A, the chinese stealth suit has resistance but no reduction,sentinel gets countered easily with staggering  perks like one gun army, i have seen people in assasin sentinel get destroyed by people in P.A.
---
Any idea on what the timer rotation is as we are getting a few other events pop but not this one.
---
I haven't seen a single (!) event on my map in two days now
---
Would you say it's still a viable build without the bug? Or am I better off starting another one until next patch
---
You get increased rewards by doing the complete repairs. What he's saying is, just as he was about to finish the full repairs, the other guy came in and just restarted the reactor. So he definitely got event rewards, but not as much as he could have if the other bozo just stayed AFK
---
Seeing as you get 500 shots out of a fully charged one, which generally costs about 100 caps, I actually consider them pretty cheap.
---
2mm EC is probably the one ammo type (outside of ultracite ammo perhaps) where you can get away with a price of more than 1 cap per bullet and still expect things to sell well.
---
The rotation is completely random
---
Sorry, do you want me to delete it? I just thought Beth should listen to you
---
I mean, I'm excited to have another grind i can set goals for myself with but i wouldnt say its "something else to do".  Seems like we will be ranking it up doing the same stuff we normally do.  Which is fine but it's not exactly new content or anything.
---
The best ally is a silent one! ;)
---
it's going to increase enjoyment for me, as far as i'm aware, only fo4 had a food mechanic and it was part of the survival mode which was supposed to be the hardcore mode or something. food and water drain far too quickly, as well as class freak not working on speed demon for some reason *and* constantly getting dysentery or parasites from a single rat bite or hit from a diseased animal is really getting old, especially if you play in power armour which is somehow watertight and able to purify air in the ash heap but not enough protection against a tiny radrat. 
---
not to mention all the carry weight i will be able to save when i don't have to cart litres of water and mountains of food around, i am very happy that consequences for not eating / drinking are on their way out. i found it a tedious mechanic which just ends up wasting my time, enjoyment and carry weight.
---
you know they try to kill you on sight right?
---
The question was about the price in players vendors
---
It’s a public event so you’ll receive a notification on your screen for it. I’m not sure what the rotation time  is for public events off hand. Go into a public world for a while and then hop back into a private one so it gives you a different server instance.
---
Its all about finding that golden junkies weapon honestly. I farm legendaries starting at capitol biulding (ghouls) --&gt; Whitesprings (ghouls)--&gt; Hunstersville (Super Muts)--&gt; Wes Tek (SUper muts)--&gt; The Burrows(ghouls) rinse and repeat. Takes me maybe 45 min if I dont disconnet from server, and I sually get 1 level and about 6-7 legendaries out of it.
---
The enclave and the raiders are not evil. First, MODUS realized all the leaders of the enclave he was protecting were evil and didn't care about the US, only themselves, so he killed them because they released the scorched. This is why he kind of messed up, he killed his own creators against his own programing.  He is actually trying to help by giving people the means to kill the scorchbeast queen.  
---
The raiders just belive the world revolves around them, they think they have the right to the land and supplies that they left when the scorch was first released. They are assholes yes, but not straight up evil.
---
2mm EC &amp; 2mm Ultracite EC - because of the cost in mats, plus the overall weight of the ammo itself &amp; and the number of rounds you can craft at a time.
---
ahm, afaik the "lightfooted" perk lets you give exactly ZERO f..s about punji boards...
---
I’m a full Vanguard, ironclad, heavy gun tank. Just added the healing serum this week to always be full health before a fight. Anti armor explosive Gatling gun as main weapon and Stalkers double barrel for backup.
---
Do you have the speed demon mutation?
---
No that’s the illiterate glitch
---
Thats up to you. If you want to take lots of chems, throw some of that biomesh in there, otherwise, vanguards is probably your best best. The answer to that question also depends on if you are melee or ranged mostly.
---
The Chinese stealth suit has reduction,  99% actually , more than power armor  and so does the hazmat suit. One gun army works without power armor too and if Sentinel isn't protecting them, serendipity sure is and yes people with power armor can take on other assassin's Sentinel players given they have a good aid supply and quantums  tank damage (for both sides). 
---
Plus I'm not referring to pvp anyways , there are together problems than just taking less damage
---
You have to activate Riding shotgun yourself.
---
It can be activated every hour.
---
Well, now it has this one. Enjoy the diversity.
---
Thanks for taking time to read my work. He is very military but flies solo. All of that will come out in his extended legend. Right now he is a shotgunner, since I am still searching for a stout rifle.
---
Meeee!! I'm super excited. I love the whole concept with playing your way through the board game. And love the space theme. Can't wait to see what other themes they have in the future. 
---
Super excited for the ammo converter. Also #16 100 scrip and #19 glow in the dark stars wallpaper. 
---
There's some other cool rewards I want higher up but I probably won't be able to make it through all 100 levels. I plan to get to at least level 10 or 20 for the rewards
---
While I totally agree with everything in OP, and much in the comments too... Sadly, all of it feels like suggestions I've seen too many times in just the past year or so (as I've not actually been around at launch). If the devs, in all this time, somehow got the message that players just don't want to bother with eating/drinking at all... At this point in time, I don't really have much hope this actual message will reach their ears and have any effect. And if they did get the right message, and just went with neutering this system, because it was easier than some detailed finetuning, well... Whichever the case, I think we might as well find a wall to talk to.
---
Thats what I did, bought 3 from a vendor and popped all three at the vending machine.
---
Challenge done.
---
actually im not so sure now
---
you will still get bonuses from being well fed / hydrated, you just wont suffer consequences like reduced AP from not eating and drinking, the perks will still have a purpose
---
That's another case of a famous Bethesda magic. It's all.over this game, and sometimes even beyond it.
---
I really hope when the Brotherhood of Steel moves in that this comes along with it. It would make a lot of sense even though people will have to wait for it, it would give the dems more than enough time to implement it properly and hopefully not cause any other issues *knock on wood* as well as give people that next big grind you mentioned.
---
Yeah that sentinels is fun when you are going against ghouls and during the queen fight. Stand right under queen and pound away. Also if you want to move around, use VATS and you can like teleport around while "standing still" for the sentinels effect.
---
Bethesda reused the asset from Fallout 4 but forgot to change the reflection. That's my guess, or it could be an Easter egg, but I don't think so. It is a little reminder that Bethesda needs to work harder on their games.
---
Bethesda: because fuck you, that's why!
---
There are a few effects the shotgun can roll or there's the 15% blocking armor effect that will make any shotgun "magic". To put it simply a magic shotgun will basically one shot most things in VATS. I recommend checking out Angry turtle on YouTube for more info. He's the one that coined the term and has a some good videos explaining far more in depth than I can lol.
---
Also for the duplication issues a very simple fix is to do a check to see if someone were to get stackable items that is growing exponentially or by n-1 I’m say a 24 hour period. If they have this then flag the account to be viewed. If someone were to get a legendary items with the same rolls then flag it if it’s 2. If it’s more than 3 then ban because currently if it’s highly unlikely that someone would get several items with the same rolls.
---
It pains me to scrap any of these but weight limits and the fact you can't sell it I have no choice.  Thanks for the feedback, I'll keep the   b/33/250.
---
Wow! I like the presentation. What a cool idea! I'm on board with that.
---
Blimey, that snuck up on me.
---
Quad cryo, and furious plasma gat w/10% aiming damage
---
Well it makes for good experience too then, I can never keep my build completely the same so experience is always good.
---
I got (and used) a two shot fatman during fasnacht.  I enjoyed that.
---
Ultracite gat lasers are..., Yeah. Get a gat plas or minigun or anything else. Been so long since I haven't been bloodied I can't really remember the #s but to start your weapon of choice is not all too grand. Do you bring psycho/overdrive with u when u go down to dropsite?
---
Plus if they've designed their backend system well, they could theoretically do a mass update of these values for all items, multiplying by a modifier (to change them all equally). 
---
But knowing Beth, they'll have a Senior Dev manually trawl through and update each one!
---
That's one of the most useless activities in the game I've spent my time for.
---
Hey mate. I was just reading this post as my new character is junkie. Without a word of a lie I just got dropped a 2 star JHM lol. I have a 3 I'm using. I'd be willing to trade it with you.
---
Junkies builds. Furious for Heavy Guns. Get something non-explosive that works with your Perk Build and just help out.
---
Well it was the regular Blue lunchbox that's in the world, also always in the station where it always is next to the bench.
---
Yeah they made her into a mascot at the amusement park
---
Yea i was thinking the same thing, one of my mules almost died from dehydration while carrying 200 purified water, it was just hilarious. Also the system lags like dogshit (PS4) whenever dehydration hits, such bad coding after two years never gets fixed.
---
But they are doing it on their own time if they launched a nuke for them to kill it. And for the "caps for fast travel" its tops 50 for 4 treasury notes minimum. Id agree you have an argument if YOU launched it and someone else cheesed it, but as far as I'm concerned if the person who launched the nuke also cheeses it then that's their prerogative. Suggesting you get something for their labor is some very commie thinking.
---
it's really an untapped gold mine. character customisation options like hair styles, makeup and other shit like that always sell like hotcakes in other games, i'm very surprised that bethesda only added like 2 or 3 different hairstyles to the atom shop.
---
Have you tried the Tent glitch? Makes them all Spawn in front of the Missile Launcher every time, easy pickings!
---
Best thing to do right here. If your not bloodied and able to put up big boy damage #s, keep her in place for the ppl who can. Support role players are very underrated.
---
That is weird.  What I did see that was strange twice now in 2 weeks is on a private server some of the canisters were missing and I didn’t realize it and triggered the event.  So I couldn’t get the food machine to 5 each and thus the event hangs around for 15 minutes and fails.  Then it resets and is fine.  I assume someone before took some and then when it became a private server I get the issue the first time.  I run around now and check first.
---
I hear you and agree there could have been more faction repercussions for siding with, gold splitting, and some of the more significant story choices. But remember, traditional Fallout games allow you to have multiple save points so you can experiment with choices and consequences. We don’t have that luxury in 76, unless you want to run multiple alts through the story. Seeing how this was the first iteration of NPC faction choices in an online world, it looks to me that the devs were being cautious so as not to make players feel trapped by their decisions and afraid of missing out on the better rewards. We’ll see if they can take choice and consequence deeper with the BoS stuff. Overall, I found Wastelanders to be a promising start.
---
I found 2 Osmosis kits in my inventory, and dropped them. They were under Misc. The Multiscope is under junk.
---
This is so cute.
---
I've been holding off jumping into the game these last few days because if I'm going to turn in quests for xp, I might as well get some SCORE for that xp as well. Don't know if I'll try the public teams yet, I mostly play solo, though there have been times I wished I could get some help with certain quests so it'll be nice to have the option there if need be.
---
As for the SCORE rewards, there's no way I'm making it to 100 I think. But I should get the ammo converter, then I'll see how high I get.
---
I feel like you are the reason I always pick up ammo that I don't use and drop it back down in my bowling ball bag. I mean, I am ALWAYS glad to get cryo ammo from a bag or container
---
I've tried it but it wasn't working
---
The "official forum"? Have you been there?
---
Those that can do something are not there, and those that are there point to useless pages in their "help" section.
---
That is, if the post is left standing...
---
Here on reddit, we actually do have the sometime ears of the managers, believe it or not.
---

Stealth vats rifleman, using a silenced junkies gauss rifle, i hit for about 200-300, crit for 500-1000, depending on range. I also use a junkies plasma rifle with flamer barrel, that hits her head for about 50 (non stealth, first few hits are around 120 from stealth but then i get detected and it drops to50) but hits about 3-4 times per second so the dps is pretty good, but only good for when she lands. If I cbf wasting ammo I use a silenced TSE handmade that hits from stealth for about 50 damage if both shots land, And finally my instigating gauss shotgun, only got this recently but it packs a decent punch, with 30% extra damage from perks pipboy reading is 572 damage, but with the broken VATS effect, I don't know how much it hits for but it takes a small chunk of hp off.   
---
I solo'd the SBQ with a 2 shot gauss rifle, but have since gotten the junkies aswell as my other fun weapons, so im keen to see how fast i can get her down now, took just over 15 minutes last time
---
It is a bug. I guess Bethesda does its best to be even and maintain a rule: bringing in a new feature you have to break two other ones.
---
Nice. Thank you!
---
I was in the SBQ fight and not paying attention when I got killed by an ant and a Mirelurk hatchling while in T-65.  What's the purpose of having PA?  I just don't get why Bethesda made PA so vulnerable to small creatures.
---
It's a good read for those of us who understand it. This game attracts all types, some of us pay attention to the tiniest details
---
My fully perked heavy will do about the same, maybe a point more, with a ultracite gatling. My non perked melee was doing about 12-16 per hit earlier with a gatling plasma. The only real benefit  to using gatling lasers is the amount of shits with power user.
---
No, we can't mod fo76 as we did with the predecessors. 
---
The "builtin api" is just good enough for QOL mods, but only on PC.
---
And people that don’t even run silos are the ones always crying.
---
To summon it up, the only reason regular armor is viable is because P.A isnt, if they introduce legendary P.A everyone will be running around in their unyielding sentinels P.A,besides there is a reason hackers sell assassin sentinels and unyielding sentinels P,A., if bethesda wants they can add strangler heart and t-65 P.A poison resistance.
---
What are the other effects on your gauss minigun?
---
To be fair they already have unique rewards, but I wouldn't mind if they added some more. The issue is people not knowing how to run the events combined with them being slightly more difficult than the run of the mill events.
---
We also have all the cheat-hackers and bots. We're more like PC dystopic race rather than master race.
---
No problem at all :)
---
Bad luck and soooo frustrating
---
I believe the YouTuber's name was juicehead.
---
I love people who freeze her, i can do some pretty good damage when i can get 5 charged gauss rifle headshots in a row, kudos to you my man.
---
Gauss miniguns are always explosive, but mine is a B/33/25
---
I find that without any food perks, just eating dog food (without the dog food perk) I get along just fine. I feel like people are too concerned about one hitting enemies. I have t60, a handful of legendary weapons, and no food buffs. I get along great.
---
Finally i can get rid of 10,000 some .38 rounds
---
I posted a whole Ode to Dailies going away, but Mothman said in the data mining they keep all the same stuff and it shifts from Atoms to Score.  I know Mothman from the forums and he seems very tuned to the facts so I had assumed old dailies gone and new stuff or just a rest from that.  Now I think it might be just a shift and thus far less exciting.  So I am far less excited now and will move back to a “wait and see”.  Not a fun hater by any means, but if that is what the data mining showed it is far less exciting.
---
I’ve server hopped a few times can’t seem to find any vendors with them in.
---
a fleet of ships on the river (west side of map, forest area) because the forest is a "Viable settlement area"
---
and they'll open up that land chunk, on the west side, as a new area, filled with brotherhood camps and other such things.
---
I use them to draw attention to something. Like, I have a funhouse type camp that I guide folks through. At the end, I have them hit a button that launches a rocket that’s on the top of my building. I throw a flare at the rocket so they notice it, then shoot at the switch so they press it. Other than that, they’re pretty useless
---
Medics/Junkies/Instigating minigun can melt the Queen in seconds and 45/556/5mm is a lot cheaper to make and bulk than 2mmec
---
Ain't that the fucking truth lol. Or the ones that take 10 years to run it 🤣
---
I always make sure to show newer plays how to do it the FAST way. Should never take longer than 15-20 minutes from entering the silo to entering the keycard.
---
I sometimes shoot them if I find a legendary, but nobody has ever come running to join in. It'd be cool if they could call in some allied faction people like in 4. 
---
Maybe they'll have some use with public teams.
---
I would consider asking someone with a "please" that passive or aggressive. Its not an instruction, but a request.
---
For the Blue Ridge Caravan, isn't the amount the player gets from player vending already 90%?
---
The Chinese Stealth suit + fireproof basically negates her sonic blast and her dive attack, only need to worry about taking damage when she lands is trying to hit you directly. I used a 2 shot gauss rifle when I did it and I was just letting her pass overhead until i had the best % and charging my shots, didnt do exceptional damage but if I could off a few charged shots in a row as she flew low around me it would take a small chunk off. Other than that it was just being aware of surroundings (marsupial and a good tesla rifle can be awesome for taking on majority of the adds and the gauss rifle can destroy the larger ones like scorched fog crawlers etc.) it wasn't a hard fight, just a long one.
---
I use them when I'm at my CAMP at see there's newer player's nearby. Fire 4-5 off into the air. Grabs attention.
---
Also, for Fasnacht I used them for fireworks. And Meat Week to let people know I was there.
---
Full health with primed automatic Zealot's handmade. Queen damage is anywhere from 25 to something like 125.
---
They simply need to buff rewards for all boss fights. If they can guarantee a three star drop, could still be the usual nocturnal golf club but three star, and directly deposited to the stash like Fasnacht if you’ve dealt enough damage, a lot more people will participate. It’s very easy to give people motivation.
---
The chinese stealth suit doesnt have legendary effects anyway, and it has 1000 damage resistance,not reduction.
---
Reminds me of dark souls, and I like it! It may be easier to implement a new game mode or event based around faction pvp. I suggest this because everyone does not have God roll equipment ready for pvp like others do. Some people spend HUNDREDS of dollars for items in the game just to fight others in pvp. There's no skill at that point. It is just whoever has the largest wallet.
---
Ah fair enough, it seems to work the same on PC, but when you spam H for heals, only the first stim does an animation.
---
I got an AA faster reload GP as one of my first 3* back towards launch. Still use it pretty heavily to this day. 3rd effect is one of the VATS ones, can't remember which, but obviously it's pretty useless
---
Yep I most commonly have to activate all 3 pylons on the Imposter event and deal all the damage since most people doing this are under leveled who just want to complete the side quest.
---
I think what happened moreso than the explosive damage, is that you’ve actually got a “magic” gauss minigun. The 33% cats on it makes it magic, so the damage output in vats is insane.
---
I usually go pick mine up Sunday afternoon
---
Count yourself lucky, I bought 3 scout armour polymer mods while not paying attention, they're about 1300 each IIRC :-)
---
So It’s literally once a week in real time?  Like not in game time?
---
You can put on the stealth armor or a hazmat suit before you get in PA. That way you can hop out for scrapping or fixing a weapon.
---
Once a week. Real time. I believe the official time is sometime Saturday or Sunday, but with my timezone I just wait until Sunday afternoon.
---
They messed it up with Wastelanders. I don't know if Update 20 will fix it or not.
---
Should help spot cloaked players🤞
---
I love the Maria Kondo reference LOL. Its basically the fire power version of my build without the QOL perks. Lots of detail and cool tips and tricks to make life easier. Wes Tek laser rifles with also net you a crap ton of plastic.
---
Yeah no ones just going to give you one pal. They are very rare
---
Imagine if it was 4-5 weeks to get a full armor set - and come the 6th week, they release a new set that's just better than the one you just completed. Numbers may vary, it might be 2+ months for a full set with the new one coming in the third, but... yeah, that's your generic MMO gear treadmill, sadly it's just a way things work these days. The very point of it is exactly to prevent people from getting everything in a few days, to make them play every day for a longer period instead.
---
I get that they're crazy rare, but I don't get it. It's got many variants and not even the better of outfits in my opinion.
---
I just got the one with the reduced AP cost for power attacks as I use melee more in PA - silos especially
---
Definitely me. New player, super excited for ammo conversion!
---
It has both, radiation reduction and  1000 rad resistance. I'll record footage and show you that I take less rad resistance from hazmat/chinese than I do in power armour  later and power armour doesn't have legendary effects either. You can wear backpack with the Chinese suit allowing for 120+ carry weight or more rad protection from lead lined mod plus you will almost never get hit if you sneak because you can turn invisible
---
Same here. I got a big problem with picking up too much ammo I dont use lol.
---
I've seen 60,000 Cap offers be declined.
---
At the gates you'll see a limousine, behind that there is a wooden post. If you position your Tent, on the road, with the stairs alongside the post, it'll work! It's honestly so much fun, love this event now!
---
I'm aware. The question is, is it price per item, then yes, fusion cores win hands down. If it's price per shot, then it's probably 2mm EC or some types of ultracite ammo.
---
Then it is, yes. Cryo too.
---
Because the endgame sucks. 
---
The people who kill her this fast drop 2 or three nukes in a server, then hop and do it again. 
---
There’s no point in wasting time or ammo fighting her for 15 minutes when the majority of the people from the server are barely damaging her. 
---
Unless youre a low level, you should do more than enough damage in 40 seconds to get something from her.
---
I'd love so much to see this implemented as a full game mode alongside Adventure mode. You can play in Adventure mode (which would have pvp removed entirely) when you just wanna hang with your friends and do events or take workshops without dealing with bullshit, then you can hop in this full-fledged pvp survival mode when you're up for a challenge.
---
I'd start with Vault 76 faction up to level 25, join the Responders to start testing the pvp out before most likely meeting up with the Free States...though that could change depending on the character or build :p
---
That's cuz caps are worthless haha
---
Wave if you see me in the xbox watseland!  Gt same as name on here
---
I'm not interested in the grind that comes along with it, nor the reduction in Atoms it's bringing. I'll try it, but my hopes for enjoying it are non-existent.
---
Some great thoughts in here, and obviously a lot of work, but there is nothing that would make me interested in PvP, and if Bethesda starts balancing the game around PvP I won't be playing it.
---
I know its magic, thing is I saw the extra damage numbers that pop up when the explosive effect procs.
---
Every build is boring to the right person.
---
This is a great setup idea! Would love to one day get a fully fledged Chinese Remnant faction too since
---
Bold strategy, let's see if it pays off.
---
Mine as well
---
There’s always the threat of death and yeah pvp is out of the question if your bloodied but it’s really fun to either have to kill it or run
---
Gotcha. Not sure about that
---
Yes. But I have no desire to drag a fight out anyway. Saves both resources and time.
---
You do the same thing you would already be doing but instead of 4 rounds to kill a mutie it takes one, maybe 2.
---
We will know once we can test it some.
---
I switched to Bloodied because I've always felt Sniper Rifles in games should be one-shot, one kill when shot to the head. I was getting it with Instigating, for the most part, but if the enemy had a sliver of health gone, it didn't work.
---
Also, it makes me, a human, less tanky and more vulnerable. And as a level 200+ going up against level 50 enemies, I feel like they shouldn't be bullet sponges.
---
I wonder what the vendor thinks when they see someone has just bought their entire stock of something. Haha sucker!
---
HW: Primed Zealot gatling plasma with all hw perks, does \~36 to the head close/mid and more if adrenaline is running. 
---
Gunslinger crit build (every 2nd or 3rd hit is a crit): with a non primed AA western: normal shots around 25-40, crits 150-350 depending on range and adrenaline status.
---
Both are full health without junkies.
---
I'm a lvl 50ish PC player and would love to play with other people, but find it near impossible to find folks willing to do the same thing as me. Have had trouble with my mic, not sure why, but it works sometimes. Tag is DiscoLando ig. Good luck out there. Hopefully new team mechanic will work out for both of us.
---
No excitement on my part. Dreading the reduction in Atoms it's bringing, and the fact it's just another grind. Also have zero interest in team play.
---
As far as I know, earlier photo quest line. The bucket list if I remember correctly. Not a photo quest but the ones to retrieve three items for raiders.
---
Grats! What did it drop?
---
I don’t think it should be that much of a grind from what I have seen, seems to be a play normally and get more things...I could be wrong, just saying what I think the plan is i did go through the levels and add all the marks up, so you’ll get 1500 atoms just for leveling...plus what ever you get from the challenges. I don’t really play enough to try for the challenges as I play for maybe an hour a night so the dailies never get done or weeklies, I pretty much just aim for the long term challenges lol. I think there will be a good amount of QOL that will be added
---
Congrats!
---
This makes sense, I saw this video of a guy using a BE Gatling Plasma and he dealt much more damage when the Queen landed and he shot the ground directly below her.
---
Back in the day, I had Earthworm Jim for the Genesis.  This game was from a time when every game had a manual, and a well written manual was a special treat.  I spent many a night reading through the Legend of Zelda manual, or others, letting my imagination go wild.
---
Anyways, the Earthworm Jim manual had a quiz in it, to determine how big of a fan of Earthworm Jim you truely were.  One of the questions was roughly: "Do you refer to him as "EWJ" in conversation, even though that is more syllables to pronounce than "Earthworm Jim"?
---
I mention this to point out that "SBQ" is the same syllables, but fewer letters, than the full "Scorchbeast Queen".  However, "Sierra Bravo Queen" is the same number of letters, and more syllables than the full name.
---
Therefore, I can only conclude that you are a most supreme of the supreme fans.
---
what
---
....it's a glitch so it's just as bad.
---
For me, I was tired of events failing because only one or two people would show up who also weren’t bloodied. I think I made the decision while I was farming free range back in the days where it triggered much more frequently. I got tired of the Brahmin dying because the squatch didn’t go down fast enough. Same with project paradise. Now, I don’t need anyone else to show and can take down the Sheepsquatch or a scorchbeast in one swing. I’m just in it for the rare loot, getting it as fast as I can. Don’t care if the fight was a challenge, just care if I can complete the event if no one else shows up or not.
---
Also note that diluted rad-x will not mute your mutation, so you can get rad resistance without losing your mutation's effect.
---
I can be up close with a 95% chance to hit but all my shots are missing. If I back out of VATS and try again, my shots register.
---
With rare gear like this, true. But still.
---
Junkies minigun and junkies .50 cal. full heavy weapon build.
---
minigun does 7-8 at head on ground 3-6 while flying FFR really comes in handy.
---
I can usually get all 500 rounds on her per landing.  
---
.50 cal does higher numbers but doesnt shoot as fast, 50%limb damage doesnt really help anymore either.
---
That sounds awesome, I’m so set in my ways since day one. Steel lead and gun power = 10mm I still craft ammo mostly
---
haha I was thinking about that.
---
I got the plan very early(20k caps. I have no shame). 2 drops from mumbles: medics n suppressors ffr. 1 real world drop from fasnacht a furious ffr. Been trying the whole time.
---
Sorry, I should have said it really
---
But it's the lvl 70+ adds that swarms me.
---
I think I would make room in my stash for that much stable flux but I might just be an outlier.
---
If you play daily you should be doing daily atom challenges. Most are realllllly easy and repetitive
---
Scrip values for legendary PA were datamined back in April 2019, before the purveyor went live. Hackers on PC have already created legendary PA, meaning it has multiple legendary attach points, so it was changed from fo4 where it only had one. The new mole miner underneath the purveyor in the rusty pick has a ton of PA pieces on its shelf. My guess is that's what its role will be, since right now that mole is useless. The only other alternative is that they scrapped the idea, which is starting to look more likely the longer they don't add it, and it's already been over a year
---
haha.... Can't tell you the amount of times I've seen the * vampire lead pipe!
---
1am Sunday UK time
---
Turn to the dark side. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant compared to the power of a bloodied heavy gunner.
---
I couldn't believe it either. Easily the in-game achievement I'm proudest of.
---
Bloodied is only fragile using normal armor. For SBQ you just put on power armor and face tank her, bloodied get access to emergency protocols in power armor which stacks with nerd rage. I spend at most 3 ultracite fusion cores on that fight solo (I don't even have a magic gun, just bloodied), which costs 6 almost empty cores and 1 flux to make them. Why spend more time farming ammo,be less effective and risk not getting rewards in public games?
---
TY
---
Or nuka grape.  Having to stock one or both of these constantly is kind of a PITA though.  Recommend just holding off on mutations until you can get the card/cards and enough luck points designated. Then just turn yourself into a severely mutated freak.
---
I mean I no it's still gonna be the same stuff that I'll be doing but honestly as a fo1st member I have way more atoms than I need so I didn't feel enticed to do any of them but now I'll at least have something to strive for you no that sense of accomplishment you got back when you were still finishing things for the first time
---
Support player here.
---
Got a Q Cryolator for the SBQ. She gets murdered to death in a few minutes with a good team I can support. 
---
Also got a zealots 2525 so I can keep the crispy critters under control.
---
Here's what I've noticed: If I don't go pick mine up on sunday, I can't buy any until next sunday.  At least for me, he is completely bugged and will only sell to me on sunday.  Don't know how or why.  Hope this helps.
---
Definitely agree about the lag. To me that's the only annoying part of the food system but it's very frustrating.
---
seriously awesome write up. wish i saw this two months ago when i started building towards junkies! i was able to find the great majority of this info, but i had to search everywhere and piece together bits of info from different sources/threads.
---
i also started to slink into a pseudo-bloodied build too. Junkies is great, but stacked with some of the benefits of having lower health can really kick it up a notch (BAM). things like radicool, unyielding, and bolstering all work on scaling, meaning you don't have to be at 30% or less health to reap the benefits, and in the chance that you do start getting roughed up, the benefits only increase further as your health drops.
---
Hey, u/Bethesda you want to take care of this active hacker right now doing wall kills?  Richard\_Montana.  He's on right now killing everyone in a radius of him through walls!
---
Ultracite .50 is super easy to make. After 5mm, I’m fairly certain it’s one of the highest craftable ammos.
---
I’m thinking of using my ammo maker in conjunction with the converter to make quick ammo to then exchange for 2mm ec, as I am a heavy gun pa build...and the ammo maker does not make the 2mm ec...right now all i do is make 5.56 to sell, but to be able to get the most expensive ammo in game for doing nothing, but loose a few hundred caps a day....is well worth it. Imo
---
In the past I only did the one pylon 'cause bloodied, but I solo'd the event the other night on my rifleman, just to see if I could. 
---
I've been meaning to try that for a while. It went reasonably well with some quantums and super stims. I died twice as I was running at half health or just under. I think I'll go full health next time and put some troubleshooter armor on. Should make it a cake walk.
---
Still she dropped the imposter hat and fixer plan, so it was well worth it, even if the legendary was crap. 
---
Usually everyone runs around like headless chickens shooting the robots for the XP.
---
Omg thank you so much I had no idea
---
I agree no clue why this wasn't put in ages ago.
---
Love the idea of being able to join/rep a faction!
---
Well bugthesda actually listens to new atx or cosmetic ideas and completely and utterly fucking Ingores all screams begging warning pleading whining and bitching.... So guess what get posted.
---
Rewards are across all characters too, I'd assume like NW rewards.
---
I have looked just to see what they were...but like i said I have only been playing since February, and have just really started getting into the storyline, once I get the main story and sides done I think I can look at the challenges more prominently. To be honest I have the fallout 1st so I get atoms each month from that...plus I buy about 50 a month for atoms if there are things I really want....so doing challenges just for atoms isn’t a needed thing for me
---
That's how I'm viewing it. I like doing the challenges and such for the actual challenge not just the atoms so it'll be nice to have a different angle on doing the same sort of thing. I'm genuinely excited about it.
---
There is a max of 1000 , got to spend it before you hit the cap
---
The people doing this have hundreds of hours in the game. 
---
At some point you too will want to get your build to the point that you can do a lot of damage to bosses, if you stick around long enough. 
---
The endgame would feel infintely worse if level 300+ people had to struggle to kill her.
---
Players can be very interested in pvp if its not a broken mess we have now. Its Beth who has zero interest in fixing and balancing pvp.
---
It is the developers task to fix this somehow. Players are just playing the game.
---
For me the only ammo I don't use is mini nukes , rockets, 40mm,and cannon balls. To exchange those you need to hold on to more than one , according to the exchange rate chart. 3 mini nukes = 100 points. Means that if I get one mini nuke, I have to hold it until I get two more , to exchange them. So for periods of time I'm supposed to have either my stash or character, hold onto 12 extra pounds until I finally get a third mininuke . This does not mesh well with my play style. So for those who love finding bags of useless heavy explosive ammo, I'll still be dropping them.
---
We have one in our crew who refuses to go bloodied. We gave him a q/ffr/drwa cryo and supply with cells. Usually only takes about 2-5 min depending on how much she lands.
---
Considering they’ve said it’s to “help explore the wasteland without the drudgery”, I’m afraid we won’t get anything like this - but that is exactly my problem. 
---
As is stands now, I play a cannibal, for the easy food. And with Wastelanders, for whatever reason, you can **rotten corpses**. You know, the ones of the BOS outside Defiance. *Through Power Armor.*
---
most of the games content needs new aspects to replay-ability. whats the point of doing any of these when running through whitesprings will net you the most of same/more w/ much less effort.
---
I'd personally prefer for each of these endgame bosses to have separate loot pools, or unique 1 time use items that would provide some benefit to continued participation.
---
Maybe we could see rare prefix/primary/secondary modules for each effect dropped from various events/monsters that would allow replacement of a legendary effect
---
Labor? Dude, if you can *solo* the queen then doing silos is even more of a cake walk. Plus, honestly of course you would link to a bloodied stealth vats build video. lol
---
(I mean it's whatever in the end, TBH)
---
Just remember after the first 2 weeks you can use the atoms your earn to buy levs so if your a 1st member that's 11 levs a month and it gonna last 4 months so in theory first members with get 44 free levs (which even as a 1st member I think this is a super unfair advantage) I honestly dont plan on buying levs till I absolutely have to
---
The survival mode numbers were really bad.
---
The only real fix would be to pull all the legacy weapons but they seem to be unwilling to do that.
---
Submit a ticket with Bethesda, nobody here can help you
---
less boring then using vanguards and vamps and never dying ever and taking 3 minutes to kill everything.
---
i ran a high health build for 230 levels, it is more boring then running a non sneak low health build. sure the longer combat can be fun at first, but after run 438 of wes tek it gets old and im just there to farm. if i want challenge, i make it for myself.
---
not everyone who runs bloodied is using sneak and a fixer to cheese everything, if you run a melee build, or go loud instead of sneaking then i find that the somewhat higher risk from being a glass cannon actual makes some of the boring combat more fun not less.
---
I think it's one week from when you first but it. I first bought mine on a Saturday so each Saturday I go to him and he lets me buy again.
---
It's one way to get around rule 10 I suppose.
---
A system like this would work great imo. I played a lot of WoW back in the day, which has a lot of different factions with items unique to those factions. This gives the player alot more diversity in the endgame in both cosmetic and character builds. I feel like Bethesda should look at this and be inspired, because this is a step in the right direction. 
---
Good job on this, definetly got an upvote from here!
---
Interesting, but I fail to see how the Crater Raiders, or the Enclave is evil in this scenario.
---
No worries, really, by now I should *know* what it means considering I'm a PA advocate lol (I own all 9 sets now lol)
---
I would totally join the mothman cult, bro
---
Admitting the only reason you can take on a 4 player team is because you have a glitched / modified weapon is totally BA dude. Im giving all my points to you!
---
\*sigh\* You can't just do 1 click can you

Beckett is easy going, but the Wanderer is nice to have around for the music, but she plays the same tune constantly.  Maybe if I move her guitar to the roof she won't play it as often. If she would sing and play some old 70s tunes, Tom Petty, Black Keys or something, she'd be a keeper.  (And if she would use a bar of soap)
---
"It's for a girl guys it's fine"
---
I would go Free States because I dont betray my Faction for Buffs. Yall WEAK
---
This would be absolutely a strong move if they deployed something even similar. I've only been playing for 6 weeks, but something that's very evident is that once I'm done with all the primary quests, I will struggle to stay engaged in the current end-game. In my short time I've invested heavily in Mothman Atom Shop bundles, which is evidence that I'm already driven to artificially create a RP reason to play beyond main questlines.
---
Pros: No fight is a challenge  
---
Cons: No fight is a challenge
---
Im just terrified what major they will break this patch
---
From the YouTube videos on it it's going to bring in an hour up to two+ to do these each day. Normally I spend about twenty minutes doing the basic dailies for Atoms. I don't even bother with the bullion dailies because there's nothing I want to buy with that currency.  If this is upping that daily grind to 2+ hours a day at the "end" grind (whatever they consider the end section is) of this each day, I'll probably just end up quitting the game and move on to something else. So nope, not excited for this at all.
---
To those who are missing out on the dailies / weeklies for Atoms, I feel you. However, you dont have that much of a leg to stand on when you say the grind is worse.  
---
Literally anything that gives XP gives S.C.O.R.E., including killing a ghoul or doing a public event. Pair that with lunchboxes that will increase XP and thus S.C.O.R.E. and you have a recipe for less grinding at the same 3 activities and more of a reason to go out and do other stuff.  
---
To answer OP, yes, I am excited to finally have a reason to play FO76 again lol
---
I estimated the grind to lvl 100 will be around 143 hours, and that’s with some assumptions such as 2 hours ish to complete a level won’t kick in until lvl50. Also that a quarter of the later levels will be just 1.5 hours. 
---
So, in reality, it could actually be worse than that, lol.
---
Well, legacies are not glitched weapons, nor hacked/modified, you know.
---
But yeah, I defeated them with an overpowered weapon. Nobody forced them to attack me at my CAMP.
---
I'm sure there's a hack you can use to spawn one in.
---
Or is this the only item in the game that is unglitchable? It seems to have retained its value pretty well, which must mean something.
---
I'm excited about tomorrow's inevitable server crashes, log-in queues, and buggy lag times that happen anytime Bethesda does something new and underestimates player interest!
---
Just joking - I'm excited too!
---
ooh, yes, i know the one. my bad.
---
you can walk around 1-4 shotting the entire game, with the exception of the SBQ, wendingo coll, and lvl 100 Squatch in a Chinese suit with a middle of the road legendary shotgun. Feel like cheating sometimes? Sure. But getting your ass handed to you for about 50 lvls prior takes away that guilt. And like bloodied, it sounds, Chinese stealth is great until you get noticed by a stray bullet, then you’re usually hamburger for the mob. To each their own, I guess. The one shot kills of high levels comes after a great many many hours of grind and work, is my guess. Shouldn’t feel guilty about celebrating your hard work.
---
No, they will break something and make the game unplayable
---
But one hit and poof you are gone, anyway as i told you before chinese stealth suit is irrelavent because it doesnt come as legendary either.
---
You're in the minority though, most players don't shell out for 1st. I can't afford to do it either so the free daily Atoms are my Only Atoms.
---
Killing the queen that quickly isn’t from a bloodied build, you know. 
---
And every build can be boring, or annoying, or whatever. I’m a stealth sniper. Just like the 5 other people doing Uranium Fever last night. All of us either had a fixer or lever action out, and only me and one other person weren’t crouched. Me and that one other did almost all of the work, and one of the people that planted their feet in the ground one-shotted one of the legendaries, while I’ve been hitting them with the stock of my gun. That was annoying. But it isn’t alway.
---
Pretty sure it's South Mountain Lookout. I was just at the disposal field.
---
The point still stands. You are coming here boasting like you have skill when you have a weapon that nobody can combat. Thats the same as boasting you have skill when you have a mod menu. Sure, you can kill people at the press of a button but is that really skill?
---
Wallpaper that can go on the inside parts of the wall when I have a window plz.
---
I too am experimenting with this, I think a junkies mid range health build may actually give you the best bang for your buck in terms of damage in the long run. Good luck!
---
Yeah, my ultracite gatling laser shoots 4-6 on the ground close in but it shoots alot.
---
So for the year I have been playing I have played various builds and went to Stealth/Rifleman just before Wastelanders.  It has been fun.  Then I got a really bloody handmade.  So I figured what the heck. Lets try it.  
---
It is stressful.  If your stealth gets blown you need to have a plan b and sometimes a plan c.  It makes the game more exciting IMO.  With my other builds there was no way I was going to die even to a Death Claw.  Now 3 super mutants makes me worry if they know I am near.
---
You forgot the Order of Mystery. That's where the real rp is at.
---
Slow Metabolism and Dromedary
---
Spoilage -50%, bonus +200%. There, fixed it.
---
Use the search function, tons of good info on the sub. Most users also have saved posts from the past, that will get shared if you get more specific with what your after.
---
If your sorting by new your gonna get a ton of random stuff, get used to searching by keywords and you'll have more info than you know what to do with.
---
I'm not a fan of removing the survival system, I personally wish it was increased like having sleeping needs on top of food and drink, but I'd rather it be for a whole new mode than to force everybody to adhere to it.  That being said, if they do intend to basically remove needs from Adventure mode, I think that's a terrible idea that makes a bunch of things obsolete.
---
If they really must tone down things, all they need to do is make cooked food or drinks in more complex dishes spoil much slower, or not spoil at all when placed in coolers, and perhaps just lower the amount of sustenance we need overall throughout the day.  That's far better than removing needs altogether it if that's their intention.
---
Preach!
---
I'm currently storing 
---
Raider, T45, excavator, t51 nuka cola, t51 vault tec, T60 paladin, t60 red rocket, x01 nuka cola, x01 vault tec, ultracite liberty prime, ultracite prototype, t65
---
It’s for the rose quest to craft Explosive bait, which btw is slept on because it helps force scorchbeasts to land, it’s in fact so slept on that I’ve never done it myself. Haha
---
Just that last bit.
---
Season 1 and public teams only, probably plenty of bugs and less atoms as far as I have seen
---
RIP, thank you for sharing your story, will try to learn from it and be more careful in future.
---
In a similar vein though: whoever thought putting SKIP and SAY on the same button in convos, especially when the fourth button (as far as I know) remains completely unused, should be put in a rocket and fired into the sun.
---
I usually do not hit the 20 a day cap on treasury notes, I usually get about 14-16 a day before i get bored of waiting for decent events to pop up (since project paradise just lingers around fir ages)  
---
Given, I play on private servers so events have to be completable for my team (so project paradise, radiation rumble and scorched earth are all out)
---
Legendary perks have been pushed back as no one liked them in the pts so I think they are gonna fix some and maybe make better ones.
---
Yes I completely understand, I’m not trying to sound better then other person because I do that, just giving my background on it
---
Saturday at 8pm EST.
---
I’ve got the red hat if that helps. Ps4.
---
Bought 6k worth on Friday, usually found I can only buy on a Sunday, two days later i went back on Sunday and was able to buy another 6k worth, hadn't bought any for a few weeks. So guessing Saturday is reset day.
---
I don't really think it's good. The conversion for points system it uses , at least the way it looks from what I'm reading, does not mesh well with my play style. I didn't build any of my characters with holding onto heavy ammo in mind. I will still just drop mini nukes and other similar ammo. Unless the explanation on paper is just poorly explained, or I'm just not interpreting it correctly. Hopefully I'm wrong.
---
Oh wow nice!!
---
War Rider Raider, Responder Excavator, Red Rocket T-51, T-45 think it has camo, T-60 BoS Knight I think, X-01 Quantum, Settler Ultracite, Strangler and the T-65
---
So u cant outright by the next updates items
---
The Secret Fireplace Door most of all, weapon skins, and Ammo Convertor of course. Also sheepsquach plushie.
---
Im happy to jump back into the wasteland again, been playing other games while I wait for this patch as I lost all motivation to do events knowing ill be 'having' to do them when this patch is out, so to avoid burning myself out on events I took a few weeks off fallout
---
True
---
That’s not been my experience as someone that hops from camp to camp daily. I find scrap boxes more often than not at random camps.
---
I like the realism I get from being a low health build, it makes running a sneak riflemen semi-realistic as you kill things easily with a headshot, as you should. It also makes you somewhat easier to kill, at least for certain mobs.
---
Having tried the vanguards vampire route, it makes you really tanky but it takes forever to kill stuff in comparison. 
---
I say run what you like as long as you enjoy it. Just because it's meta doesn't mean you have to run it or even try it. Just about any build is viable really.
---
I feel like the mothman cult and the caravan company are far superior compared to the others.
---
Oh really I didnt know we got SCORE points for killing stuff...lol
---
The specifics can be adjusted to make it more fair. But the idea is great. Ive been thinking the same thing for months... factions need a redesign to make them more appealing.
---
Yea I have been sent back to my office job so I will hope i can download the patch before i leave for work....then be able to gt on and play around 9pm lol
---
Find out on the next episode....
---
It's like the settlement functions in FO4, an after thought.
---
I recommend looking at bolstering over vanguard, or even unyielding if you're melee. the reason being, all of these scale, but vanguard scales disproportionately. Vanguard starts at 35 DR at 90-100% health. it then drops by 7 every ten levels. i.e. +28 @ 80-90%, +21 @ 70-80, leaving you with 0 additional DR from 50% health and below. Bolstering, on the other hand, starts at +0 DR at 90-100%, and adds +4 at each 10% drop. i.e. +4 @ 80-90%, +8 a@ 70-80%, with +20DR at Vanguard's +0 mark (50% and below), and goes all the way to +35 @ 0-10%.
---
simply put, with Vanguard, blows from enemies hit harder and harder as your health drops, with zero benefits at 50% and below. Bolstering continues to up the resistance as your health drops, while also giving you additional protection at all levels of health.
---
i mentioned unyielding because it scales too, giving you +1 to all SPECIAL (except END) at 60% health, +2 at 40%, and +3 at 20%. this can be extremely beneficial to melee builds, and can stack with the Barbarian and Evasive perks.
---
Gramps, just found him the most fitting for my log cabin camp. Find him less annoying than others even with constant fart jokes, plus the legend also gave me a bloodied 33 gauss shotgun from a weapon case. I won't ever be changing him.
---
So when you sneak are you noticed with agility in the 40s?
---
Cells are a nightmare to find and they are a pain to craft.
---
Meh
---
I like bloodied melee as my main purely for the fact that it makes it feel like I'm playing a Stealth game a la Splinter Cell, Styx, etc. 
---
In Styx, generally if you're seen you're dead, but you can kill people, and it's generally by a stealthy one shot.
---
I take that outlook into 76. Sure, I don't really need to given the easy nature of the game, but it makes it more fun for me.
---
I'm not a 1st member, but have some atoms saved up. I'll probably only buy my way if I'm one or two levels away from something neat just before the season ends though.
---
I dont know why I found this funny but I get ya, just sdome guys rockin up like a lost group of refugees
---
Yeah you are right!
---
commando non stealth junkie. level 365. 
---
I use either a Junkie Handmade or a Junkie Fixer. none of them are primed. 
---
body shots are ~30 dmg and headshots around 55~
---
Nice! I gotta give it a shot!
---
You can do this with double walls
---
Take the eating and drink elements from kingdom come Deliverance and plop them here and it'd all be good.
---
Do a couple lucky hole mine runs in excavator power armor. So much crystal they will call u swarvoski or however u spell it.
---
I put up marsupial serums gor 300. Some guy went and bought like 10 pf em. My immidiete though was that he mashed the button to buy without looking.
---
Bloodied gets the best defense perks in the game I can guarantee I can take far more hits at 35vhp than you can
---
What outfit is that you are wearing?
---
Maybe theyre carrying the vertibirds with [their leaders in it like a pharaoh](http://www.reformation.org/pharaoh-in-procession.jpg)
---
I'd probably drop barbarian for blocker, as stacking DR has diminishing returns the higher you go. And a flat 45% avoidance for melee is really nice. I'd also probably drop goat legs in favour of adrenaline. You could cushion the SS legs for the same effect.
---
Those are just my personal preferences though to be fair.
---
The cards say "non explosive" heavy guns...its a feature, yet a shitty one from Bugthesda
---
I wish they had a chance of dropping the weapons that you can get the plans for from those events (once you learn the plan)
---
I need to see them doing this now lmao, that's exactly the kind of thing the BoS would do :P
---
I really like the gain a small amount of intellect and perception when you stare at bright lights.
---
Have a search on the sub for diminishing returns on DR numbers. Apparently anything over 350 DR is kinda pointless so you could probably use your puts for Barbarian and Ironclad on something else. Do you also need power core duration on a non power armor build?
---
I don't agree with the meters I believe to a game point its enough and Lore wise you are a Vault dweller you have been living in comfort for the past 20 years. There are perks that slow your drain so from Rp perspective you can use those perks. And also food is not that scarce and for water two small purifying stations is more than enough for one person but I agree with the cooler because from time to time I wanna make some advanced recipes but it's a bitch to find and keep the ingredients.
---
Yeah I forgot to put that, sorry. The SS armor was going to be buttressed, and cushioned leg, JP chest, thanks!
---
This is amazing, but the Raiders are a little lacking considering everything is related to PvP, which is very situational since hardly anyone does casual PvP. I would consider giving a bonus to loot, like extra caps or ammo or something like that, or even a bonus % chance to rarer loot after an event
---
Vending machines, as usual
---
For a Gatling Laser, it boosts each one up to 1k shots, rather than 500.
---
Excellent, one small thing, do you need goats legs with two pieces of fall resistant armour? Those points could go into lone wanderer.
---
If you're in secret service someone told me that after 300 ER/DR you get diminishing returns so refractor and ironclad pretty pointless as vanguards + secret service easily tops upper 300's same with the evasive I'd change it out for dodgy but thats just me. And since you said you're a non PA build the whole power user 3 would be pointless
---
My build is so much fun, non pa bloodied is very versatile. I'm fully perked for heavy guns but having max STR I can use any melee weapon effectively (4x unyielding 1x bolstering)
---
It's still very tanky, I have a good mix of legendary effects for utility marsupial plus 2x -50% fall damage pieces mean I jump off anything! 
---
I also have food weight and ammo weight pieces combined with bear arms rank 3 I carry more chems, more aid and more food along with a Gatling plasma, a 50 cal, a plasma caster and a Minigun. I usually carry a cryolator for Queen fights, a couple of melee weapons (I prefer reduced weight ones) and a auto plasma rifle and a 10mm SMG... All of this is approximately 90lbs of my 355lb carry weight, so I can probably carry more junk than you as well!
---
All in, this means I use whatever weapons I feel like but I have some big guns to sort out real threats. I have done one solo nuke run (no fancy armour swaps) and it was a real challenge! I've also found since going bloodied I can run around and do stuff for much longer before I need to return to my camp.
---
My plasma caster hits for about 1100 usually, crits around 2500 with no perks other than bloody mess and my Gatling plasma hits the Queen for about 50 damage per shot so it's respectable but definately not overpowered!
---
I server hop a lot looking for SBQ events, usually ten to fifteen people per event, but one or two survival tents set up. Seeing scrap boxes really means nothing, your stash box stays put even if you get 1st for just one month then cancel it.
---
I'm not 100% sure, but one of the season rewards is a captain cosmos jetpack and it looks like it would be for the SS armour as opposed to PA, but I haven't actually seen any info on it.
---
Meh I’m rifle build on high rads, low hp..  If I’m not dying I’m not trying
---
The food system is absolutely fine as it is right now, it is the time system that is totally messed up.   
---
There really needs to be an adjustment to the way time passes in this game. It makes no sense that time passes as fast as it does.
---
Yeah I run the JP chest with cushioned legs and don't die from falling damage very often, so goat legs probably isn't needed there. 
---
I also run serendipity though as I run low health, which gets me out of all sorts of trouble when the shit hits the fan. I'd try it with and without and see how you get on.
---
Gonna go out on a limb and say the currently working raiders rep glitch will be broken tomorrow
---
Ah cool, you will definitely not need Dodgy, Ironclad and Barbarian if you are running buttressed secret service though. Everyone has different playstyles so hard to give you good feedback relevant to yourself, but personally I wouldn't use any qol perks like travel agent either.
---
Ive equipped the perk but still have been killed by the boards...it just seemed to take a bit longer, so I’m not sure whats going on there.
---
I appreciate the bloodied builds as they can make a boss fight much easier for the majority of people, but personally, they aren't for me. 
---
I'm running an Instigating shotgun build and I kind of feel this gives me the best of both. I get to one shot a lot of enemies which is loads of fun but when it comes to boss fights I like the feel of a proper fight so I switch to a Furious Gatling Gun as an instigating weapon just won't cut it on a lot of bosses especially the SBQ.
---
But it's all quite subjective, ones persons fun is another persons boring so I say play however you enjoy.
---
100000%
---
If you don’t have AP Regen on your armor you’re going to want Action Boy3.  Also, I like as much Adrenaline as I can get, especially since your primary weapon doesn’t have an inherent damage boost. 
---
Too bad Stabilized won’t work for you.  My heavy/PA guy can feel it when I forget to put it back on. 
---
Most of my experience is with low health build...so the suggestions that come to mind won’t work for you.  At least you won’t be clunking around like me, LoL!!  Hope the build works out like you want.  You should be well set up for Encrypted (I’m sure not)
---
Grind is fine but the atoms going from 5500-6500 to 1500 is just weird, I understand they need to make money but damn.
---
Read the card
---
Didn't think of it that way, no worries.
---
Whats coming then?
---
The armour is the Secret Service the under armour is Brotherhood Officer suit
---
 Early on i equipped Slow Metabolism, Dromedary, and Lead Belly, and never looked back. After adding the Carnivore mutation I have too much food. If I didn't vendor 90% of the food I make, I'd have more fertilizer than I'd know what to do with. I use the cooler to store Scorchbeast food, and even then it has a tendency to go bad before I can go through all of it.
---
What I would rather is being able to make the Prepared Meals more easily. Most of the plant ingredients used in Prepared Meals can only be foraged, never grown. And hoarding salt, pepper, spices, and sugar take up space I'd rather save for my shop and essential supplies. Even then, the stat bonuses for prepared meals are only *slightly* better than basic meals despite requiring *significantly* more ingredients, making it seem like wasted effort.
---
cool thanks
---
I never lose my stealth in the chinese suit lol but I also use the fixer soooo.
---
Another dupe glitch
---
XOP
---
Unfortunately I'm not going to be online for quite a bit but I'd be willing to let you try it on mine when I'm on if you like.
---
The ammo convertor will not actually work as intended. Either giving out way too much or too few.
---
Follow the creek south of Helvatia, lots of cool spots there, especially a neat Bend with a canoe.  Or, up around Death Claw Island, lots of nice spots there, some with extractors or built in personality.
---
Thanks, I'm about to try it in someone's now but if it's good with you then I might try it again later :)
---
They must be used in a certain order. X-cell , overdrive, psycho. The psycho can be any version, tats or buff.
---
I'm ready, bent over and greased. Waiting for the inevitable.
---
There's a small hopeful part of me that's enthusiastic and looking forward to it.
---
I got mine by showing up to public events (easy ones) and just using the Map to send team invite requests to other attendees.
---
Yeah for sure i dont mind.  as long as I get to afk and leech the 4 notes xD.
---
Feel free to shoot me a message on xbox if you ever wana.  My GT is same as name on here just make sure you let me know you're from reddit and stuff so i know who you are!
---
Maybe you should focus on being nice to all
---
I've got over 2k in Crystal at the moment so enough to last me a few rounds. Good thing there is a tinkers bench at Watoga.
---
Use x-cell, then overdrive, then whatever psycho you like. Has to be in that order. XOP
---
Yep!
---
Ya'll are thinking way too hard about this. The caps exists for 1 reason only:
---
1. Artificially extending the content of the game by necessitating you adhere to the timers so as to keep you coming back for longer than the 2 months of actual content
---
why?
---
1. profit
---
Thanks so much :)
---
I can not get it to drop for my main character either...6 months and a tuckfon of events. Lots of white fedoras though. Started a new character, got to level 50quick, did the quest, ran the event....boom. drops the first time. RNG at its best.
---
How exactly do youdo that? I'm so close to the ammo machine?
---
You on Xbox?
---
That sounds like a bug with the enemy themselves, not your weapon.
---
Nah, this is not about skills. I do not have any, but I have a weapon that nobody can combat and I know that.
---
I just do not understand what is good to provoke me to use it. 4vs1 is not fair, so I have to use unfair methods too.
---
And I just do not get what is the point to attack other players at their own camp (so not at a workshop).
---
The ammo converter turns your ammo into pumpkins
---
I'm unsure what you're mean by this. That's already a thing. I can apply wallpaper to all my window pieces.
---
 https://imgur.com/hy6eX2F
---
It is bugged. Right now if you use x-cell then overdrive, then psycho, they will stack. You can do it without x-cell, just use overdrive before whatever psycho you like.
---
Wave to me too! My GT is Fallocaust.
---
xD
---
Spawn mats would be great.  I've lost count on the number of times I've contracted a disease because of a water landing at home base!  :D
---
Exactly.  Do you want to spend your time killing things or gathering resources for ammo?  Can’t skip from event to event if you’re constantly out of ammo.
---
as long as the cost is stupidly expensive Im onboard...
---
I feel like food could become viable if they provided MUCH more beneficial effects in addition to lasting longer than a single hour before spoiling. Nearly all food items as they are simply aren't powerful enough to justify their crafting materials (some of which are obscene) and the ludicrously terrible shelf life.
---
For some reason I couldn't. I'll have to look again
---
Saturday nights at 11 central time he resets for me. I’m lucky enough that if I talk to him in between that he doesn’t make me wait longer.
---
Does xcell really do something? Adding 15 or 20% to damage I can get, adding +1 to all SPECIAL points it's hard for me to calculate into damage or chance.
---
I'm more annoyed that the foundation bullion flares cost 5 plastic to craft just one. They must think plastic grows on trees or something.
---
I think I'll be happy if food was boiled down to a system of buffs and debuffs. Where as food is optional, but if you do partake in the system you are well rewarded with a wide selection of actual benefits. If the benefit/reward is worth the effort, then I can assure you people will opt in more than not. 
---
Of course for something like this to take effect, we will need a few changes done to the current food system.
---
* Longer Food Expiration Timers (The current rate just kills the whole food system)
---
* Ability to Preserve/Sterilize/Freeze Food (at reduced/increased benefits or something)
---
* Add in a Free Version of Coolers/Freezers/Sterilizers/Preservers
---
* Have different levels of "quality" for foods based on the ingredients (Boiled Water Vs Purified, etc)
---
I think it would work well if it was similar to the brewing system. There are a lot of drinks to make with actual worthwhile benefits (ex: Rad Ant Lager). Combined with the fact that most if not all of them do not expire, it's excellent. Let food have even more benefits to make up for the fact that they can expire (unless Preserved/Sterilized/Frozen/etc).
---
Is there a way to get a different daily quest? I only ever got one when it first came out..tick blood tequila I think. I was never able to do it and have gotten none of the recipes.
---
You need to find a similar looking croc to hang out the top now!
---
Oh really?  Because I recall having a conversation with them at first.  Maybe it wasn’t the most pleasant conversation but they certainly didn’t engage in combat at first sight.
---
You need that canned meet stew, 4 birds.
---
I think this is a good idea, but some of these bonuses need tweaking. Extra stash weight, as others have pointed out, is very hard to beat, and a plus 1 to every stat just for being in the mire seems to be a bit much. Meanwhile, the BoS could also include Atlas (for reasons that should become apparent in the next few updates).
---
Maybe give the free states a buff to ballistic weapons and the cultists a buff to melee and bows?
---
That Croc you have has some wicked camo, I can hardly see it. 
---
Love the pack btw.
---
In no way shape or form a bug. Read the card
---
You said to give you a better form radiation protection than power armor and I did , Chinese stealth armor or hazmat suit. So it is relevant and you can still be tanky in anyone zone with the right perks, blocker, serendipity,  barbarian , evasive, dodgy, lone wanderer  and junk shield.
---
I mean the crater raiders around the map, they are hostile until you do the quest
---
Meh, I’d join the brotherhood. I have no idea what you guys keep in your stashes but I’ve never really had storage problems.
---
Good luck with your upcoming barrage of “power armour is easy made already” messages.
---
If they do add legendary pa it should have unique legendary effects that are completely different to normal armour
---
Yeah I have done now, I don't know why you can't change your display name in game seems stupid
---
Something I have deduced is that the 76's are the best in America and they lived before the Great War, they saw the Liberty Prime posters, the comfortable way of life and someone came up with modifying their Power Armor with that design.  I think the Atomic shop sells ideas so that our character can invent these skin and camp objects
---
Well, have they said anything about releasing Legendary power armour?
---
The kitty jetpack backpack combines with it nice as well. Which means the reskinned one with the monkey is going to look good too./
---
I enjoy my blooded builds both melee and ranged.  Don’t want to change. Simples😍😍😍
---
Very cool...I must have missed that when I was reading the inside the vault
---
If you go up north west top of map and follow the road up towards WV Lumber there is a nice flat embankment I had my camp at for a while. There is sometimes settler NPC's there but you can still build there. Negative - it's a bit of a fast travel for anything south of the map, but it's a nice tranquil spot.
---
I would side with the responders, I think they should have anti scorch and healing stuff. Nice though not sold on pvp though
---
It's a bit of a mixed feeling for me.   
---
On one hand I'd love to get rid of the explosive rounds of all types just because my only strength card is Bandolier so i'm Just skipping through the wasteland  with 40,000+ rounds of ballistic rounds but 4 mini nukes and i'm dragging ass.  
---
On the other hand I quite enjoy running around like a demented wasteland lady of the lake but instead of handing out swords (which is NO basis for a system of government) I'm handing over 2,000-3,000 rounds to low level fresh out the vault players.  
---
Warms my irradiated heart to watch them running off murdering everything in their path.

I wouldn't slow down the meters at all. Its completely manageable as it is now. Food lasting longer would be nice, and a freezing option even so we could start farming and selling certain foods. In which case now we have desired consumables that we can store long term, it'll make hunting or farming certain mats part of the end game and more enjoyable.

I haven't played for a month or two really, I've been pretty bored of it and I don't think they are going to add the type of content i'm looking for. Hopefully I'm wrong id like to start playing again but for now i'm kinda done.
---
I can’t wait for the 30+ pasts tomorrow asking why the servers are down anyway.
---
Wow, great idea. I think I like the sound of geting more and more tanky rather than less. I think ill start looking for more Bolstering and maybe a few unyielding.
---
No they aren’t.  Blood Eagle Raiders are but they aren’t associated with the Crater Raiders.
---
i *know* there are advanced recipes, but i dont actively look for ingredients. for what? spend all that time to be hungry again in 20 irl min? even if i could go around and buy exotic meals (i mean, i can technically, just a matter of spoilage), but why? i step out my camp and i got water, tatos, corn, mut mut, etc. i just spam whatever simple meals i can make and move along. i enjoy the idea of a survival aspect, but this is not the most engaging way to do it. its almost inconsequential. hell, a newbie player 30 min into the game can have a vet player drop them so much surplus aid, itd ruin the game for them. as stark as Appalachia is, aint nobody starving (bad gameplay mechanic, but does go to show how supportive players can be, so kudos on that point).
---
Boomer
---
So you know what time the servers will be back up?
---
Damn Poe’s law, damn it to hell!
---
iirc they said the mole miner will be getting a new role over the summer at some point. Nothing specific about legendary PA. It's all speculation on my end based on the info we have
---
Even though becoming an untouchable demi-god with an insane damage output is something I do in every Fallout game, I admit that once you reach that point where you're in no danger, and you kill everything in one hit, the power fantasy aspect of it wanes very quickly when even the biggest threats die like nothing.
---
It's very different from becoming so skilled in a game you have amazing aim and tracking to consistently hit weak points or something, and you're just so powerful you can brute force anything even without really considering the skillful aspect of it.
---
I have most of the components for a fairly successful Bloodied build, maybe not the most meta-worthy components, but still enough to probably trivialize some of the most powerful creatures in the game.  But I'm very hesitant about it because I know once I do, I'll probably start reducing the thrill I have now with my semi-auto style I use now when stealth inevitably fails on some of the harder fights.
---
It's very different with a multiplayer game, because if I choose to be overpowered in a single player game, I'm not really harming anybody but myself.  But if I choose to be overpowered in a multiplayer game with group activities, then it's really possible for me, or others to begin raining on the parades of other people who might want to do something themselves. 
---
I don't even like how powerful some mutations are because they contribute to trivializing certain aspects of the game, but unfortunately, because instancing doesn't seem to be a widespread thing, every player has to kind of encounter scenarios where they can encounter players who are ridiculously powerful to the point where any challenge is trivial.
---
Vending, displays, ammo converter won’t work, another dupe method, Queen only flies and lands outside of playable map area, can’t exit power armor unless all cores are drained, favorited items go missing.
---
I'm not sure if they fixed this in the PTS, but one minor thing I'd like to see them fix since they're adding Public Teams is the strange inconsistency between Quit to Main Menu and Quit to Desktop.
---
If you ever roll in a team and swap characters, you know exactly what I mean.
---
Quit to Desktop preserves the fact that you're in a team, so if you restart the game, Play with Team is an option.  But Quit to Main Menu, unconditionally, forces you out of your team.
---
This makes no sense.  If anything, it should be the other way around.  Ideally, if you quit through normal means, you should get a prompt about whether or nor you want to leave the team.  Otherwise, if you crash or have an unexpected shutdown, the team status should be preserved by default.
---
I just found my first one. Saw 4 people in the cranberry bog woods and thought I’d go check out what they were doing, knowing it was on of the spawns. Helped kill it and got the vocal sack on display next to my 12 frogs
---
Yeah... Not that into pvp.  Already hate it when a bored level 300 one shots me when I try to take over the junkyard in the middle of flatwoods for resources.  Can only imagine the griefing after this kind of switch
---
Trust me everything beats the day1 patch..  content is getting better
---
Usually teams do not play alongside and mostly team up for benefits (shared perks, more travel points and such). You could very well play solo continuously while being grouped.
---
Make sure you're aiming at the physical wall and not the window opening.
---
To be honest, I think the general appeal of bloodied is because in RPGs and MMOs a good portion of people play the game to min max their builds after doing the quests and things. Bloodied is definitely the max to get to.
---
Personally I play junkies. I'm always tempted to give bloodied a go and I'm passively getting unyielding SS pieces while trying to roll vanguard, I may try it at some point if I ever pick up a good bloodied rifle. To me though, junkies is good enough, I already kill most things in one shot so bloodied just seems a little unnecessary and overkill.
---
I no there is a reduced number of atoms but if you think about it it's not that bad cuz you can still earn atoms for free from world challenges and instead of atoms you for daily and weekly challenges you'll get score which gets you rewards that would normally be sold for atoms so the only real down side is we are losing are ability to choose what we get
---
Anyone who's been paying attention to the BGS development cycle knows this is never, ever going to happen.
---
Launching a nuke at Fissure Prime will mess up the spawn points for the SBQ and Wendigo Colossus causing them to spawn next to each other everytime, epic battle ensures!
---
This is what I thought a Fallout Online should’ve been before release. 
---
Players would be the factions. Trade, war declaration, killing leaders, alliances so you can discover new places or get rid of huge threats. 
---
Maybe even persistent servers, so you know everyone and where they are, making for a more realistic world. 
---
Maybe in fallout 77.
---
I have seen it. You can try it easily for yourself with a new character.
---
Build your CAMP to its max and then walk away. Don’t return until you have leveled five times. Don’t touch the STASH.
---
Go back into Edit mode and you will have more budget.
---
I only just got 8 possum badges to get the high capacity mod, working on a few more to get the stash box then I’m done lol I mainly do operation tidy once a day but I did do a few badges. Congrats on grinding them all out! Here’s a trophy 🏆. It’s gold not platinum sorry.
---
Right??
---
No. We never know how long a update takes.
---
Duping comes back and more dupers suggest ‘let me give my buddy this awesome roll i just got’ and ‘let me reroll this effect at 100 modules per’
---
Ok so how then? Please explain the mechanics to me. What perks allow you to not take any damage below 35 health AT ALL so I wouldn’t one shot you? I’m not trying to start something believe me I’m just trying to understand the mechanics. What works best for me might not be for you!
---
Yes same as the wardrum and guitar sword
---
Why would you wear power armor in a nuke zone? Just don your Chinese Stealth Armor and kill everything, this is not a difficult game.
---
Thank you very much, I had a feeling but haven’t had the chance to confirm.
---
Maybe for ALL of them, within some criteria im too stoned to think of right now, have a stash increase at the max reputation with each faction.
---
I would be down for this information👍
---
Yeah, for my Resistances, I'm pushing 362, 332, and 297 for Damage, Energy, and Rads in that order, so I think I'll take off ironclad, Barbarian, Refractor,
---
And evasive, and spec into something else with those points. Thanks for the help!
---
Yeap no problem
---
I'm excited but I'm hoping they make it flexible in score value so you don't have to do every task to get to level 100. I have a bad feeling it will be. Every week/day there are challenges I can't do such as 10 events in a team etc.
---
Your frustration is misdirected. Players shooting stuff as good as they possibly can is to be expected as in any other game aswell. The problem arises, cause the gamedesign in FO76 does not account for that sufficiently. So you should direct your wishes to the developer, not the player.
---
Depends on time but I can open my private server up.  I am on vacation so I am pretty open. GT LastWeeksFreak
---
You could even potentially change out fireproof if you put dense on the chestpiece, but thats totally optional if you want some extra perk points
---
I’m jealous of your second character! Sounds like it’ll have great luck at the purveyor too 😊
---
Problem ist: people don't want PvP apparently. Boni for being in a PvP faction "forces" people to do PvP, which again, people don't want to be forced to do.
---
Todd knows!
---
i think it was the wastelanders update took about 5 hours. Should be less than that.
---
I do this alot. Mainly because other games I play my jump/double jump/long jump button in those games is mapped to getting out of PA button. I forget.
---
Nerd rage, dodgy , serindipty
---
Soooo.... What's magic?
---
I’m gonna have a look at those!
---
The ass the apocalypse was built for!
---
I feel like the main reason they are removing this aspect is because it's something of a beginner's trap.  Early on, managing your food and water is more difficult, which incentivizes new players to over-invest in Endurance (a generally useless stat) and anti-hunger/thirst perks which ultimately become unnecessary once you are able to hunt more efficiently and can build Water Purifiers (which are junk-intensive for new players).
---
Personally, though, I'd like to see food not spoil so quickly (it feels like it's doing it during fast travel again, which is something they had removed at one point) and for individual servings to be more satisfying.  I mean, my toon is basically eating a 9-egg Mirelurk omelette and gallons of Corn Soup to feel full.  That's a bit excessive.
---
Agreed, it's really important that we see team leader quests ... As we used to do before Wastelanders I believe.
---
Only 30 your optimistic
---
I really like this idea tbh
---
I'm getting bored. I'm not someone who likes wandering aimlessly and I'm at "I am become death" for the first time and need to do some work on my strength etc (also tips because I am taking FOREVER with the bots in the silo?) But I'm bored. I'm low on missions. Trying to go peg off every map location etc.
---
These should be options once you're done the main quests and story. Pick which faction you want to build up. We could rebuild BOS.
---
My stash is like 90% vendor items
---
Probably like 6pm like always
---
It’s so you can’t immediately get whatever stuff is added next, not bad game design.
---
The only shotgun thats viable without the bug is The gauss shotgun from wastelanders in my opinion. So yes, IF you want high dps you are better off going in a different direction for now. With that said, IF you play alot with friends you could be a good support character with explosive shotgun and enforcer perk in agility. You Will cripple everyrhing in 1-3 shots and let your team do The damage
---
Not boring at all, full of surprises when I respawn
---
I actually really enjoy the Order of Mysteries part of things. I was sad when I found them laying there holding eachother dead!
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aktp14/budget_costs_of_different_structures/?utm_source=amp&amp;utm_medium=&amp;utm_content=post_body
---
Hope this helps you out. Not sure how up to date it is though.
---
Thanks for the advice, but let's be real, no one can withstand Encryptid.
---
I think it would be logical that stash or even carry weight bonus should also be for the blue ridge caravan faction.
---
I am not participating because the rewards are old, but because those events are simply pita. And I for one can not see any reward making them worthwhile for me again.
---
Just too many standing around w/o a clue.
---
I can help! I still need a couple of those trophies too. I will be online in a couple of hours, add me if you like - Chez206 😊
---
What's special about the Foundation flares? 
---
btw imo plastic isnt that hard to find, i have 4400 just laying around
---
no i mean normal raiders and raider psychos around the map, they are random spawns like settlers and scavengers
---
Sure, will do! I will message you when I'm on later
---
Some people have nothing better to do and think that they’re always right with everything and everyone else is always wrong, even if they have the same views.
---
Problem is there is nothing new to be grinding alongside it. Just the same stuff we have been doing since launch.
---
You're seeing things. Bethesda have stated themselves that it doesn't happen. What you're probably experiencing is when they've changed the budget, on certain items, at a later date.
---
I found it the same way and it allowed me to stay far enough away that I took no damage so I just grinded away at its health with my gatling gun.  Not much to get after as it left me a 1\* something and some junk.
---
Any idea what time the patch is released. And yes I'm excited. Just realized the you can only build 30 display cases. Unless there is a way to get more ?
---
Welcome to reddit.
---
Actually went to two today that had 10=15 players on pc
---
People can be jerks
---
I mean, people who PVP usually use Explosive weapons, so I'll keep on fireproof, so I can still jetpack as well.
---
Who cares?
---
Not a terrible idea (and the graphic is nice), but those faction buffs are ridiculously out of whack and unbalanced between the “alignments”.
---
Not to mention the fact that I find it incredibly debatable that Foundation is “good” and Crater is “evil”. Based on my experience playing through Wastelanders there’s an argument to be made that both are “neutral”. (Lawful Neutral and Chaotic Neutral, if we’re using D&amp;D alignment.)
---
I think a better tweak is to keep the faction buffs, but ditch the “alignment” concept. I’m not sure my character is “evil” because she picks Raiders over Settlers, and I’m not sure that picking Crater means she’s somehow diametrically opposed to the Vault 76 mission. (Even if “alignment” doesn’t lock you out of opposing factions, the very concept means that a player character could go from “good” to “evil” with the click of a button, and that doesn’t seem very sensical to me.)
---
I only mama dolce.
---
Came hear to say this
---
I have only ever seen someone attack a camp like 4 times in my entire time playing Fallout 76. And 3 of those times was provoked by the camp owner. People dont just randomly attack CAMPs, especially when they are carrying junk. They have so much to lose (including the ammo used) and just about nothing to gain. Im not really hearing this "I had no choice"
---
I meant the radiation modifications.
---
So that's what you can do with the vocal sack, I will have to do the same, but with one frog of course,
---
Yea its all down to personal choice :p I dont pvp or use explosive weps so dense works fine for me
---
Took 5 hours. As in to download? Because internet speeds differ.
---
Or 5 hours downtime, whilst they reset servers?
---
Had two high levels jump around to server to fight every one the workshops. They would wait out the defend event then PvP who ever had it, smash everything and leave. This was during a claim a workshop daily....
---
Don't forget any of the big enemies that you'd logically use explosives on have bullshit resistance to JUST explosives just to twist the knife deeper.
---
This would be sweet! Take my upvote OP.
---
Still waiting for Mr pebbles backpack to come back its probably one of the most fitting backpacks for a Jetpack
---
Bloodieds are more survivable than you think.  Well, to a point.  That point being when Mirelurk Kings show up with their translucent poison spit.  Or when the Super Mutant with the Minigun drains your AP through Dodgy.  Or when everything goes wrong in Charleston Capitol and you get swarmed by a dozen Charred Feral Ghouls at once.
---
That's what keeps it interesting, really.
---
Two of my characters also wear rather flimsy and scant armor too, and there's a trade-off for survivability and looks.
---
Disappointment
---
To each his own. Just not getting any xp boost for that.
---
How does one respond to this comment?
---
Welcome to try on mine as well. no need for any payment or anything but if you do want to i'll take some junk you don't want. Got to fill that box up as much as possible before i cancel. 
---
Besides. I'll get some flux out of it.
---
yeah that's probably for the best
---
I can only play on Sundays so the daily limit is crap for players in my situation...
---
Are they making it capable of not having to dashboard to stay on the same team?
---
maybe they should fix their scripts to not have a meltdown from making a basic boolean level decision
---
Pretty sure Reddit does that itself, to counter the auto self-upvote you get from posting and commenting.
---
I could be wrong, but it's a common complaint on a lot of the subs I frequent.
---
that's cool, I'm often alone with some low levels (around level 40 to 60) and try as best carrying them through the event.
---
"look how many people are logging in each day! everythings fine"
---
Yup, they want 76 to have the same model as most mobile games :-(...
---
It all depends on your build tbh. What build are you?
---
Damage negation beats Dr
---
I only sort by new, it’s been happening for weeks. Welcome to reddit 76.
---
Let me introduce you to cola stacking everything is viable then
---
I totally love this. Beth plz consider
---
I heard they are fixing this soon
---
Is it bad that I'm doing the crater raiders solely for the armco machine? Also, can someone explain what is meant by the changing of the factions and how you can only have 1 faction per day?
---
What do you sell? Dozens of heavy weapons?
---
I will say I have been non stop playing these past few days to try and complete all the atoms challenges I have left 😂 it’s been a grind let me tell ya
---
Let's face it, we're all here to "talk to the wall". I swear, I get more enjoyment talking about this kind of stuff knowing it will never get implemented than playing a decent portion of the game. 
---
Really goes to show how inept these devs are. The whole gameplay side of developers on this game are shit. They're total shit.
---
I just need a power armor that is a power armor where I could carry more than with a normal armor + backpack.
---
what are the odds the unused score rewards become atom shop or get added in as bonus score levels if too many people finish it too quickly
---
Vending machines temporarily disabled due to a  glitch allowing players to buy inventory items from the dev room.
---
To fuck us? I really don't get it.
---
Some nice water locations just south of pleasant valley station. If you cross the road you'll see the first. Then there's another to the SE which is quite a big pond/lake. And it comes with 3 free cows.
---
We need this badly!
---
No thank you. we have enough of these
---
Downtime was 5 hours +
---
Any idea on if we can predownload this or not?
---
No. They must stay dead
---
I use a TS FFR Cryo with very little damage and freeze her very fast.
---
I get you
---
Yes when under the effect. But when addicted and not under the drug it is a reduction. Sorry about confusion.
---
Great question. I've not seen any of the YouTubers speak to that. I hope not
---
That’s America’s ass!
---
My only issue is with the free states cause having my camp attacked by large amounts of enemies constantly isn’t exactly appealing and actually why I moved my camp to a more remote location in the first place
---
Bots, Reddit itself, salty people. Take your pick.
---
Some People suck
---
The sink so I can wash my hands after interrogating raiders
---
changes in opposite of QoL needs decrease current players and help reduce loads on servers, eventually resources (servers, workers,etc) be allocated new players.. online game without subs is tough.. now these all make sense right?
---
Tested my magic shotgun on pts, works still the same 👍
---
Alright thanks
---
Search the web, there are route maps out there.
---
K so I recreated this with the advanced conduits? The ones with the junctions and stuff and found 5 of them were 1 percent. Meaning they’re worth 0.2% percent unless my math if off. (Could be) walls are worth a little over 0.15
---
Going with a high health vanguard build on this character.  Thanks for the reply.
---
One of the best part of updates are all the posts asking if they're banned.
---
Junkies gauss shotgun. 
---
long range shots do 1,1,1, ooh 2,1
---
When she lands and i hit the face it's yellows across the board and it's like a dozen 80+ each blast. Which is nice. 
---
My alt was 45 with a HM two shot and was doing 16 a shot and 20 on crits.
---
But then you have to manually apply every armor piece back on. An easy fix, but they won't do it.
---
Encryptid farming is expensive at like 2k caps a try for a 20% chance of getting a fixer plan. Fixer plans got duped to heck so their market value died making the initial 2k investment not worth it to start the event
---
It's not Worth it, Friend. Bloodied, junkie or antiarmor with either 33% crit chance or 50% limb Damage Will one shot everything other than scorchbeasts. So Furious and ffr are really really sub par right now.
---
Thanks 🙏🏻
---
Even just beefing other weapons to be viable against the current top tier 1s. There are so many weapons in the game that are just throw aways because they don't get close in dmg output.
---
Funny you said that!!!....I was all excited after getting the plan on the 1st try and went immediately to the Rusty Pick! Wasted 600+ script on worthless armor, pool cues, rolling pins, etc. RNG Jesus said I gave you one....don't push your luck further tonight.
---
TONS of ammo
---
I'm not kidding, I run on .45 and shells EVERYTHING from mini nukes to arrows gets put in the vendor
---
But you shouldn't have to when camp budget is such an issue. There's literally no reason for this not being in the game already.
---
I wish you luck in your next roll. To be clear - the effects I mentioned are important for VATS use. If you dont use vats, it's less important. I have a quad Gauss that I actually use the most.. good luck.
---
This change is so wrong, I'll just dump all the food and water and not them ever again. All those food &amp; drink related items are useless stuff now. It's a stupid reduction for a game that launched to bank on survival games' popularity.
---
Yes, that's another reason they need new rewards.
---
basically you only have one active faction at a time, where you get the effects of being in that faction
---
maybe, maybe not.  
---
Its a win/win.  You make 300 caps, then your buyer goes to the closest train station, and can make 120 caps per.   35% ROI ain't bad.
---
Ah I see. If you were going bloodied I would’ve been able to help haha. But alright man good luck!!!
---
Not trying to defend them, but I already said it’s the only way to pvp in this game
---
Do many people buy your mininukes?
---
Omg this is an Xbox issue too! Why bother building a vending machine to have nothing in it? At least be near some useful locations for missions!
---
No that makes sense thanks!
---
You didnt, i said armors that have 15% rad reduction per piece,look at my initial post,the suit is irrelevant because its one piece and non legendary, your argument is that the legendary effects sould be applied to P.A, P.A has its own MODs And stabilized perk,if it was like  this  [https://imgur.com/gallery/qa7G9f5](https://imgur.com/gallery/qa7G9f5) it would be OP and people would only use it, anyway im tired of this, let bethesda do what they want i dont care anymore.
---
10:20 AM EDT but every time someone asks it moves further back by 5 minutes.
---
Don’t be a gash.
---
Not sure, switching to other weapons like my Deathclaw gauntlet worked to kill them.
---
nope, we have never been able to predownload patches, only the steam launch was able to be predownloaded, and the original launch
---
Goddamn console gamepad control schemes that has to assign every button multiple functions to make it work.
---
Not me.  I'm not into pvp.  I appreciate those that get it and move on.  The griefers, however, are the antifa of Fallout 76.
---
I started playing two weeks ago and have constantly had players give me stuff. I had a guy come into my rinky dink house I built and put power in it for me, along with a tinker bench and power armor station. I have had others give me guns, armor, aid and everything in between. 
---
After leaving the Red Dead community, it's like a breath of fresh air.
---
Yea that's what I mean too if the season is about to end and I'm close to the end I'm not gonna lie I'll buy, but I got downvoted for some reason
---
My explosive .50 cal still gets boosted. It just doesn't boost the explosive damage.
---
Not often, but I sell them for 5 caps a pop and someone just came and bought 6 yesterday. I try to keep a supply for people who are trying to find ammo - ive been through it enough times
---
Plus it helped with my dealing with the sentry bot in vault 79 haha I got all my missiles and went nuts
---
Tons of people love AP refresh, but my build has lots Agility in my SPECIAL and with 1 piece short of full Unyielding (I use a Chameleon piece) I get loads of AP that for my secondaries I can use other beneficial effects.
---
Free states seems a bit op with the legendaries, flares could summon them with aligned free states.
---
Same could be said for enclave and brotherhood, summon fellow members but could use new items. Distress beacon for brotherhood and beacon for enclave. Maybe have a small chance that player summoned is placed on a turret of a vertibird drone with the option to "rope" down. 
---
Vault 76 should probably be for everyone still, it helps people meet new players and aid them. 
---
The trading company if it doesn't get cap buffs could get a reduction to camp fast travels of other players, train stations and major hubs. Almost free with that one perk?
---
or where did all the free atoms go
---
lol
---
World challenges take forever even if you actively go after them. I don't see them as a reliable way to get Atoms really. Honestly 99% of what they're offering as rewards is stuff I don't want. I don't want a sink, I don't want the power armor skin (I'm more than happy with my atom shop red rocket skin), there's nothing there other than the ammo converter that I can say I WANT. So I'm looking at this just about the decrease in Atoms for more of a grind. So definitely not looking forward to this.
---
That's an amazing hair!
---
I don't think I would for an extra 100 lbs tbh, and it would be cool if the settlers had the majority of players imo, cause most wastelanders would probably fall under that category
---
Talk about judging a book by its cover. Some people aren’t into building. Been that way since Fallout 4 introduced settlements. Or there’s me, who’s using a pre-existing location that’s a rundown cabin because I think it looks neat. Just because the spot doesn’t look good to you doesn’t mean the shop is bad.
---
Yeah for that they might as well charge atoms, it would fall in line with some Eso crown store options.
---
its a hand flare that you throw and lasts like 20 seconds, super expensive to craft for what it does
---
waiting for the costume to come back 😓
---
My argument was to introduce bonus effects, actual Legendary effects will make normal armor useless, making a new problem.
---
Not the best but it's still a gauss shotgun and it's still gonna kick bottom
---
An instigating would be better if you cannot get one of those the other person mentioned.
---
That’s hilarious. Well done.
---
Yeah, definitely a good point. What gets me is the people that just spawn in and rush the the vendors before the rest of the camp loads in, then fast travel the second they’re done shopping. I’ve put in hundreds of hours building my shop, only for some people see like 20% of it. To each is own, but have a look around next time!
---
Appreciate it!
---
Good! I love it!
---
It took some time to adjust to the fact that I‘m playing without any DM resistance but it‘s working really good now. As a stealth build I don‘t intend to get noticed so the enemies are dead even before they see me coming.
---
I also use the adrenal reaction mutation so I can adjust the damage output with my health. And even with full health I do a lot of damage. A scorch beast is down within 5 shots. My lovely behemoth neighbor at twin lakes within 4.
---
I‘m playing with non automatic rifles. A BER E fixer and two BER Handmades. Oh... and my BER rolling pin. But that‘s just for fun 😅
---
I‘m trying to farm some uny and chameleon armor with AP refresh now. One set high level broken. One set with a lvl 2 character at the mole lady. With the right chem addiction that armor can be pushed to 0 DR.
---
Want to check both versions to see if there is any difference.
---
you still offering the help? need to revive someone in water.
---
I'd say it was
---
But now they added mods that give normal armour the same resistance, so normal armour now outclasses power armour
---
I like for it to revert to only needed for a buff. But I would like to see if they plan on changing the food and drink backpack due to this change.
---
It's possible on every wall except the wooden one
---
So you chose a playstyle where you can carry a Lot less while simultanious need to loot and farm a Lot more.. yea, fun All over...
---
Scottish here too! Woop.
---
Woah whats this blue ridge trading caravan?  I havent played in like a month.  New faction or did i not find them before?
---
There will be at least one new dupe glitch
---
This has been happening for well over two months now.
---
My carry weight is 430 without PA. I’m good 👍
---
Great concept, doubt bgs would ever do that though.
---
It's a machine gun, a heavy weapon, the grenade launcher is an explosive gun
---
That's really stupid. I have wooden walls and it works but not for the window piece.
---
I would give it around 5-6hrs until stuff is running again, add 2 if they encounter difficulties.
---
Have you recently run the event on another server? I'm guessing you have, it happens to me too if I run it regularly. Pretty sure they are on a timer, if i haven't run it for over 20 hours they usually spawn for me.
---
Coolio! Now I know to swap it for something useful during PA stints thanks
---
Go back through all your others and find one that is either instigating or junkies, or that has 50% limb damage, 33% vats, or 40% bashing. Any one of those, doesn’t matter the other prefixes or effects. Plan to use it in vats and check out the damage output (ignore the base damage in the menu). Those can one shot a super mutant behemoth in vats
---
I'm going to also add: The Demolition Perk in Intelligence exists just for this. I use Two shot Auto launchers with Demo 5 and they hit up to 1000 damage, usually 700.
---
What you mean with double walls?
---
Try life saving instead of bolstering armor for that single piece.  You might like it
---
It's not location at all. It showing up and seeing a massive albeit empty tower, to get a shop thats selling Mac &amp; cheese and nocturnal gear
---
Basically imagine fallout 4 with a stealth commando build but on permanent psycho, killing a mirelurk queen in 3 hits becomes normal and anything less is an insult
---
Most fights become completely trivial, except for the new boss that completely counters bloodied builds
---
I just want ceiling wallpaper.
---
What's 'pts'?
---
I think it’s more with seeing people having 20+ weapons and armor each listed in their vendors only for you to fast travel there to see the vendor filled with literal shit. 
---
I can understand people filling vendors to get people to see a beautifully built base but if it’s just a vendor, piss off lol.
---
Instigating was one of the “magic” prefixes
---
I was stoked! Then, they took legendary perks out, bummer. But we still have the Wendigo Colossus event, **YAY!!!** 
---
Say whut?... 😮😖😳🤐
---
Unarmed junkies stealth build does 500 damage per punch to the head
---
I'm glad you enjoyed it, bc it definitely has something there. Don't get me wrong, I loved the locations, characters, weapons &amp; armor. Bringing back Petrovita &amp; her lil quest to uncover Bradberton was funny asf. The Hubologists have a great questline w a lil Zetan spice hidden in there. I just think it falls flat outside of Nukatown USA. 
---
There are some cool locations outside the park that I feel don't get utilized to their true potential, even if there were just a few more settlement locations I'd be happy lol
---
The big gripe for me comes from the individual parks... I think they could have done so much more than "go here kill x claim park for x gang" but then again that IS F4's gameplay loop. The individual quests themselves are cute &amp; fun (I loved Kiddie Kingdom's) however I was hoping to see raider gangs themed after each park, and true settlements being raised in the parks after you claim them. They could have been settlements themselves (which would make absolute sense). 
---
TL;DR: Nuka World is a solid experience but was lacking for me in the "Anything Outside Nukatown USA" department.
---
That's literally one of the cheapest
---
They need to increase it to 1000.
---
Nah its not just me its several people seeing it.  Mission starts. you go to pick them up and poof the canister just disappears without any interaction on it yet.  and the timer thing cant apply as this is now 2 days in a row its been happening.
---
I actually jump on this mission any time it appears but for me this is brand new.  Mentioned able its been going on months but TBH its been running fine for me since Fascnatch so I dunno...
---
Are they? Damn I expected them to be quite dear, dunno why
---
A Nula World collectron would be badass btw, especially if it was the Nuka Cola bottle robot. Imagine she could have the option for raider or park voices lol
---
I don’t think you can, which is stupid
---
I know this is a video game, and I know we all have different realities and different points of reference. 
---
That saids, 
---
These are rich people problems you have. 
---
"WTF do I do with all of this stuff?!" 
---
I'm obviously poking fun.
---
Well done! This is an amazing idea!
---
Dunno its been fine for me this just started doing this since yesterday.
---
So you can still get the max effects of all of them? You just cant use them simultaneously. What decides which I'm in for that moment?
---
A unicycle would provide hands-free transportation for weapons useage.
---
6xm
---
Bro. You've gotta buy that flag pole from the Atom. Shop. And merge it so she's got something to grind dem cheeks on.
---
I'm exited for the huge game-breaking bugs that will be introduced with the update! Come On, Stash Loss!
---
Happened to me twice now in 2 weeks but I play on private servers mostly and assumed when I got the world it either didn’t repopulate or others took them in a failed attempt and they didn’t repopulate.  Sucky part is you have to wait the full 15 minutes now for a fail
---
Hey is all the info on this thread still accurate!? Please and thanks!
---
It's sad, that from experience, instead of being excited for a new update, *we're grimacing*, knowing something majorly bad will happen...
---
I disagree, I think that's exactly the point, choices with consequences
---
you would select one in a menu, that can be changed once a day (obviously you could leave the one you were in, but not join another one till the next day.)
---
You only receive the effects of the one you are in.
---
I would say the 76 Enclave is more neutral than evil
---
A bloodied build is like having a difficulty setting in the menu. You can adjust your health and perks and have everything from hard to easy difficulty. You can even heal up fully and swap to vanguard armor and junkies weapons to do things that favor high durability (if you want it easier), and then go back to bloodied afterward with minimal adjustments.
---
It's the most versatile build in the game.
---
If you play with other people a lot you may never see a need to scale your power up to a full bloodied build, but if you play solo it's useful to be able to solo events that are normally team events. Doing SBQ, encryptid, rad rumble, and project paradise solo as a bloodied build is hectic and difficult, and what I would call a good fight.
---
It's one of those things that you don't really get till you've tried it (properly).
---
Same thing happens in Operation Tidy. The yellow toxic waste spawns (you see it from a distance) but disappears as soon as you get close. You have to server hop several times to make them not disappear... It's so annoying...
---
I was under the impression that we already received 90% of vending machine sales - is it really only 75?
---
It's ass backwards logic that you can create 10x the number of .50 cal that you can make .308 but that's just how this game is
---
They seem to always plan the resume time to be 2:00-3:00 pm. Whenever they needed longer down time, they start earlier in the morning.
---
Interesting fire place idea, a lot of good detail, looks like a labor of love
---
The rates really aren't that favourable, and considering the often super generous yields from crafting (especially with Ammosmith and Super Super), I can't imagine lead will see much of a dip in value.
---
What platform? And the trading sub might be better for this :)
---
There is a way to travel faster in real time, but it takes a very particular setup of mutations, perks, legendary armor effects, and a long gold grind to get the SS jetpack. But here it is in action: https://youtu.be/nbYemhMfq3E
---
It’s how I get from a workshop or camp to anywhere I want to go on the map without using caps to FT
---
yep...
---
Sneak.
---
Hmm, aye I've had it happen as well, it was just a thought, I assumed it was maybe the personal respawn timer, the one for 180 items, maybe it really is just bugged.
---
 Xbox
---
What about the Blood Eagles? I think they definitely fall into the "Good" category.
---
All combat rifle mods fit the fixer, so paints will too.
---
Wrong, that's like saying we should direct our concerns about gun crime to the gun manufacturers, the shooters where just doing their best to shoot people which is to be expected. And not work to fix society to not create criminals in the first place.
---
Just because you can do something doesn't mean you have to or should.
---
so 3 seconds to re-apply your armor?
---
I am a casual player, on from day one with a single toon.  Level 175 is all I earned, with less than 900 hours in game, as I don't chase XP.  
---
I REALLY do not have a problem with food/water part of game.  I have a problem with how much time I spend working to stay feed and watered.  My best guess is that I spend about 15 of every 90 minutes of game time doing something about food/water.  
---
JUST reset the timers, don't get rid of it.
---
Every SINGLE time I log in I have to:
---
Hunt/gather 
---
Cook
---
Drop or convert spoiled food
---
Sell food that is close to spoiling that I will not get to eat.
---
At least I don't have to wash the dishes!
---
I had this issue for a little while. Seemed to fix itself in a day. 
---
If that doesn't work than try temporarily changing the window type or turning it into a wall to apply the design then change it back.
---
Where's the mole miners? Us mole rats and mole people can be friendly too. Just don't invade our land. Upvote this comment for mole rights!
---
Yes. I want to roll along in power armor in high-wheel bicycle.
---
And royal jelly
---
I suggested getting rid of fusion cores for PA and with the replies I got you would of thought I wanted to make every piece a 5* legendary including the chassis.  Dosn’t make sense to me why anything I do in PA consumes both the fusion core and AP, whereas being out of PA it only consumes AP.
---
Especially since fusion cores were only introduced as a consistently needed item for PA in fallout 4.
---
I rolled a 2* Q 10%WA on my first try.
---
This game is forcing me to eat like Kim Jong Un. Bethesda should add fucking food factory in this game so you can buy it for 10 000 gold bullions.
---
Fast travel will work properly...
---
Totally understand the idea, but I'd only do the following:
---
good = responders
---
evil = blood eagles
---
everyone else
---
The imposter sheepsquatch sure does have some lucius curls
---
serendipity and dodgy would be a good replacement for PA if you have unyielding gear
---
Bloodied Unarmed here: make it spicy by using the lowest tier weapon not in your spec lol.
---
My side piece is an explosive bloodied Pistol and a Bloodied Bowie knife.  My goal is to clear a silo with every weapon type on my bloodied build, so far my fav 'meme' one is the buzzblade.
---
With glee!
---
When it came out on release it wasnt even a timed item but it got taken out sadly
---
I got 2 charters fully allied with full ss armor. Almost done with my third.
---
C O M M U N I S T   DETECTED ON AMERICAN SOIL.
---
Yes. Like everything else involving navigating the UI, it's needlessly tedious. Switching into a hazmat suit should act just like power armor and re-equip whatever you were wearing before you equipped the hazmat. Hold E on hazmat to remove it.
---
You mean after gutting all the major content? I don't think this counts as making the deadline.
---
[https://fed76.info/a/unlisted-item-mod-effects/](https://fed76.info/a/unlisted-item-mod-effects/)
---
Stinging/piercing 20% armor penetration, perforating 40%. I personally always use swift magazine as stealth vats commando. For me tank killer is enough penetration.
---
Then again power armour had the balance in 3 and NV that you needed training to wear the armor (which made sense) but the armor had excellent defence and stat buffs 
---
It has way more buffs here than in those games at a technical level, but with less investment needed to get said buffs
---
Legendary gear has kinda made things stupid op... Hope we can go back to how things used to be in the game
---
Love these ideas 
---
Maybe 
---
Crop yields double and can be sold from your camp 
---
And maybe a slight increase to camp size to accommodate a larger farm space
---
Yeah... but the non-PA users do this? I fail to see how this is such a burden.
---
*sets out on bike
---
* bikes along a crumbling debris filled road 
---
"Oh whoops drove over the fragments of glass and shrapnel from years of neglect,  time to fix that puncture "!
---
/rinse, repeat
---
Yup, I have a quad with the bugged effect 40% bashing. It’s an absolute beast. Still misses most first shots in vats though so I usually use my magic two shot instead since the second shot seems to hit for bugged damage with one vats use
---
*poison sting wing enters the chat
---
And the event. They gutted all the major content. Delayed again, imagine that.
---
One is accuracy other is Armor penetrating I believe, I’m running low hp high rads with a perforating mag on a   Gause rifle, seems to decapitate quite well, I see limbs, heads go flying all the time
---
They should also add animations for eating and drinking, and make food fill your hunger bars significantly more. You shouldn't have to eat four packs of Salisbury steak to have your full hunger bar. Increase saturation so you don't need to eat as often and then add an animation to eating to add more immersion.
---
Has to hit to kill
---
Yea I saw that...Its kinda what we as players have been saying tho right...we dont want them to push out content just to push it out...id rather be able to use it and do it right then say great we got this but its broken...guess I have to wait 2 weeks for a patch fix...and by the way...player vending is gonna be taken down ......lol ...to soon?
---
If only we could put that on our resumes
---
It's not so much a burden as a quality of life design oversight that adds another layer of tedium to an already tedious user interface. If there's two (three with stealth armor) main clothing items in the game that when equipped remove all your current armor and one of them auto-equips what you were wearing previously, why not have both act that way? 
---
Is it a big deal? Not all all. But it's yet another QoL hurdle that should have been ironed out by now.
---
Brahmin milk or grape nuka will cure rads without removing mutations, regardless of perks.
---
I found out last night I’ve got a mini gun that has one of the effects and fire rate is above 200 with accelerated barrels... is that one also?
---
If you’re playing bloodied stealth commando you’re already doing enough damage to overwhelm the DR curve on all but the very toughest enemies. Stinging gives you more ammo capacity, so that’s likely the most useful.
---
You're right about that, but still, I frigging loved it. Fallout 4 in general had tons or cut/unfished content, it also looked like that they were going to explore some special underwater areas with sea monsters and such, how damn sad we didn't get to sea that. Maybe with 76? That unknow monster surely looks like a baby cthulhu. Hope 76 survives enough for us to see more stuff, but looking at the direction they're going.. I somehow doubt that. Game should have been stable with little bugs by now, yet we still got issues that have been around since day one.
---
Yea I have a bloodied heavy non pa build, and I almost never die. My dr is 497.
---
Not sure the tent thing means much.  I have it and rarely drop one if there are a couple already there.  I very rarely die during SBQ so don't need the spawn and I can use the boxes from the other tents if I need one
---
Omfg...I just wet my panties! PLEASE GO TO THEIR FORUMS AND SUGGEST THAT! LOL
---
That's a hell of an investment
---
Yeah, try it out on something... Big! Lemme know how you get on!
---
I just completed my unyielding sent ss armor last night it is disgusting how much Dr I have
---
I thought he meant interior walls that wallpaper can go on BOTH sides. That’s how I understood it at least
---
They should hire you.
---
This, go with swift if you use vats.
---
If it would be craftable u probably couldnt trade it (this is how it works with all craftable legendarys) so it wouldnt save the economy than there are other wild appalachia weapons that would also need this addon (sheepsquatch stuff u know).
---
Berry mentats stack if you take it first, you lose the intelligence bonus but keep the purple glow
---
Overdrive (crit damage only) stacks with psycho when taken first  
---
X cell stacks with everything but I don’t recommend it 
---
Everything else doesn’t stack whatsoever
---
And that’s a bug and not just you hitting the 5% chance cause I THINK this happens to me sometimes but I have just assumed it was the damage glitch
---
Totally...And imagine what sort of bicycle contraption we could build....
---
Dude, if you play enough, you just don't have the space to store all that shit.
---
They didn’t show on the PTS.
---
Check your inventory and see if you still have them on you before you try it next time. I had that happen to me a few times a while back, and it turned out that I still had a few of those cannisters in my inventory.
---
Since word of the ammo converter came out some people might gladly accept free ammo of any type.
---
I would be totally for that....the fixers are out of control. It's crap
---
Can we get half-vertical walls?
---
Shhhh. Let people keep pricing their .38 ammo at 0 caps.
---
instigating sneak is good.
---
True , its happened so many times already
---
I thought I read the character challenges were staying? I could be wrong.
---
Sure! I’m on right now. Just add me and come on over!
---
I had a full set if vanguard armor on my first character, and was gonna go junkie. Then a BE lever dropped for me. Now I have a bloodied rifleman build, a bloodied heavy build, and a bloodied commando build.
---
I'm curious as to how you think that taking a rare top shelf item you can freely trade and replacing it with an item that is no longer rare or tradable and can be ground out for a perfect version of in a few days is going to "save the economy" as you say cause you also just made every other rifle save maybe the handmade obsolete.
---
This. If ever there was a game where hoarding is a pointless compulsion, this is it. Anything given away today is easily collected again tomorrow.
---
Its part the servers and part bad optimizing on bethesdas side i would suggest geforce experience since it goes for Performance if they are still there than u know its probably bethesda
---
They arrived with wastelanders only hint I will give is go south.
---
That last bonus for the cultist, Starr at bright lights, lols 😆
---
I'm a 405 with no carry weight perks.
---
Yeah I have all points in perception and swap between rifleman and commando. If a BE Lever fell on my lap I'm pretty sure I'd go bloodied too lol.
---
Awesome, cool, thanks!
---
I think he means adding new ones or for every character seperate i am not sure tho
---
I don’t have carry weight perks either 😂
---
2 zillion large handmade presents later
---
I'd take Cavalier over Sentinel. Your only weakness is when you sprint and sentinel doesn't work when you crouch.
---
Nah.  Since switching to Bloodied, I don't use as much ammo as I used to, even as a Commando build.  I'm also at or near max caps on five characters at all times.  I don't need the ammo and I barely need the caps.
---
I'm in the Northwest corner of the map.  If someone makes the effort to visit my place, they're probably going to find free ammo, free acid from my unlocked extractor, and free miscellaneous items from my unlocked communist protectron.  
---
If they leave my front door open, though, I'm nuking their camp.
---
There is also the question if u want to use the jetpack or not since u probably need to consider the legendary effect that decreases fall damage then
---
Yeah, I mean just adding new ones. It would make up for the disappearance a little bit. As a veteran player there aren't many I can do anymore..
---
Yup for me too and i wont spend 7600h for 20 atoms
---
Actually no, its not. I can solo the queen in about a minute without a glitched weapon but the silos tend to take a lot more effort. 
---
The hardest hitting builds are all glass cannons and theres no one else to draw aggro in the silos. So if a turret happens to notice me as i stealth my way through , gotta do it all over again. The room at the end really sucks for this.
---
Ive done it quite a few times with bloodied unarmed too and all it takes is a single assaultron getting behind you. Where as in the queen fight you have space to move and retreat.
---
I didn’t realize that. Gonna spend all day trying to clean out the ones I’m closest to.
---
 Can you meet them in game ?
---
sadly that is the case for a lot of online games these days, they are designed to keep you hooked and fun is one of the least efficient ways of keeping people hooked.
---
No, it really isn’t. A dupe would be very bad because I can profit from it, and destroy what you call an economy even more. A glitch that lets me fire a single round each time I inspect a weapon is hardly game breaking.
---
I just run bandolier and carry enough ballistic ammo to fund a small war...
---
Yea and as it was my first character I had to redo alot of cards, since I didn't know what I was doing then. So my bloodied build isn't even half as strong as it could be, and the BE lever hits for 2500.
---
Yeah there are builds where unyielding sentinel works great but a stealth commando kinda wastes it. That would be better for a heavy gunner, there are almost zero scenarios where a stealth commando is standing still firing.
---
I have a Mr. Fuzzy plush, if I ever see a croc, you know I'm grabbing it!
---
Give me your seditious materials citizen so I may eradicate them.
---
Just for the dailys. The world challenges will still be there
---
I get what you're saying, The Fixer kind of overshadows all the current rifles and renders them nearly worthless in comparison. Lever actions and Railway Rifles are more common, and worth far less despite being really solid guns because the only rifle anyone wants is The Fixer. The obvious negative from making it untradable would be that it could potentially sink the market on rifles, if everyone can craft the gun they want why would they trade for anything else? But thats 50-50, maybe everyone would start trading the other rifles more freely.
---
I'm not exactly complaining....but it would be nice not to have to eat during battle.   Never have a heard of a soldier having to duck and cover, eat a can of soup, then return fire.    Perhaps a pause to hunger and thirst during battle would help make the game more immersive.
---
How are people killing SBQ that fast?  Stacking tons of chems?
---
They're partially submerged in the dirt.
---
My hubby bought Fallout 1st for a month just to try it. As much as I hate that it costs so much, I immediately saw the benefit so I hijacked the credit card &amp; bought a year. Never regretted it because I am a total junk monster. I can not go into a building without picking it clean. That unlimited stash with the survival tent has become essential for me.
---
Well, it'll start at 10am EST &amp; go for at least 2 - 3 hours at minimum.
---
I'll jump in here if I can help out!!
---
On PC I have a spare plan, I'll take whatever you can give, however small. 
---
Also if you have the materials I'll build whatever level you need if the plan does go! 
---
Gamer tag same as here.
---
Just keep trying. It's a good bit of adrenaline when you walk in and see it.
---
I would never server hop continuously just for that, but just make it part of your rounds when on a server.
---
Totally anecdotal, but found both of mine in the shower stall.
---
I'm just getting the conversation started. I said I would be for it not being non tradeable not that it had to be. Just because the items crafted currently with modules aren't tradeable doesn't mean they all have to be...does it?
---
Nobody knows how the converter works yet either. Is it 1 to 1 for the points?  Doubtful.
---
Looks amazing! This would bring so much more character into the game, and would really spice up the monotonous grind. Just hopefully all of this wouldn’t be locked behind excessively difficult grinds.
---
I agree. While this is a video game, a more realistic food and drink system would be beneficial. Sometimes I'll fill my bars, go cook IRL for 15 mins and come back to starvation and dehydration in game.
---
Workshops are automatic PVP if its in the process of being claimed, unless he tried to take it from you.
---
Oh that is annoying!
---
When you go to claim a workshop it can be contested.  If he did that and you are in vicinity you are in PVP and if you are opening “his crates” so to speak you are going to trigger to PVP so he shot you.  When you came back he now own that shop and that workshop is most of the airport.  So it covers a lot is space and you don’t realize you are in his workshop space.  That is the first place I got PVP as a newbie over a year or so ago, as picking a lock triggers stealing his stuff.  Kind of sucked I cleaned out my junk and let someone kill me.
---
Thank ya’ll for the answers!
---
19 seconds is the best time I've seen yet.
---
After pvp is completely dead are they coming for the food builds next? It's almost like they're completely focused on the monetary aspect and everything else is being cut. That's so weird.
---
God, that’s the only bug I’ve hit that really upsets me. It’s the repetition of it that gets to me.
---
Two words Giddy-up Buttercup
---
No you’re good I’m sorry if I came off as rude. Thanks for the heads up bro, I’ll probably have to actually watch the video lol
---
I'm not saying your wrong, but is there an actual number your referencing? Almost every (like 80%) over 50 player has a scrap box at their camp. I know this doesn't mean they are active FO1st members. I would love a reference other than your opion.
---
This decision further makes most of the END perks useless.  I think it’s a stupid idea that you keep all of the positive bonuses from eating and remove all of the negative.  You can 30-60 minutes or real time bonuses.  People won’t like this - but those should be removed as well.   
---
Might as well just remove dieseases next because they do nothing but add tedium to the game.  Disease cures are plentiful.  
---
The game is already catering towards a “softcore” crowd - not sure how this will make it anything but easier
---
And to anyone making the argument of what you eat IRL - every survival game has this functionality.  It’s just an simple way to add “structure” to survival games.  
---
I don’t see anyone arguing that mutations aren’t realistic?  Hypocrisy?
---
Also your player icon doesnt show on the map if you're stealthy AF. As far as not seeing his camp, he probably didnt have vendors or had them turned off. Unless he was just being a bitch and did the "block for this session" thing.
---
Yup, same here, I feel your pain :(
---
Flare guns should start a very brief public event in general like “public event - [region] player support” maybe it can only be visible to people in the same region.
---
When I was complaining about this -- the majority would downvote me into oblivion and praise the decision of the developers, curious that your post did so well. Anyway, it's good, I was foaming when I saw that they're changing this, it added flavor to the game, and that's what we need. However, take a look at legendary perks, they're mostly boring flat % increases of dmg, armor etc.  so that gives you a good idea about the direction the devs are going. What would help is if you gave feedback on the forums and/or using the feedback page, but doing it when the PTS has said changes would be best, maybe.. just maybe they will listen.
---
As for coolers, it's so stupid that they take camp budget &amp; stash space AND only for 50% less spoilage rate. It should be limited space (completely separate from budget and stash) and 95% slower spoilage rate.
---
You get more stars the more you play it
---
You can only squeeze so many tents there. I can't drop mine most of the time. So that's a bad bar to judge.
---
Ive had some run ins like this, they can be frustrating but at the end of the day my build doesnt stack up against the stealthy bloodied guys, so i just gotta take my L and keep it movin.
---
Yeah, unlimited stash for scrap is something I’d love to have, but even with FO1st, a lot of people I know are still maxing their stashes. I’m not one of those people as I’m personally very minimalistic in terms of stuff I keep, but still. You sound like my sister though, she just has to have everything to scrap.
---
thank you so much for the help!!
---
Somehow during the course of the season some ranked items will get unlocked in atom shop by accident. Guaranteed.
---
Reduced AP cost, super fast reload with Ground Pounder and Speed Demon.
---
If you hit hard enough, armor pen isn't necessary
---
I use an instigating lever at the moment in sneak that hits about 1800-2000 with adrenaline. Absolutely love the lever.
---
No problem at all!
---
Congrats!...
---
Since the other person and I couldn't beat the beast, I just concentrated on the adds for scrap, etc...
---
Workshops are PvP areas, you cannot claim them if another player is in the area and full damage is allowed. Once a workshop is claimed, any locked containers become property to the owner, picking them will get you a wanted level.
---
i do full damage, dont have space for ground pounder.
---
Couldn't agree more. And the amount of times I've dreamily eyed up abandoned motorbikes and wished they could be done up with junk... I would take that over bug fixes :D
---
actually I noticed now those canisters that are left over are disappearing from my inventory. before this started I always had a few spares on me.  I wonder if they changed it so they do get removed when its over and this is a side-effect.
---
PSA stands for Public Service Announcement. I see the announcement of personal distaste for how other people enjoy the game. Still looking for the public service angle.
---
Huge positive is that you won't be searching Watoga for ore. It is so fricken annoying trying to use those perks to find magazines and bobbles there.
---
"We haven't constructed a new robot in the last 3.5 seconds, better do that as loudly as possible.  Also these robots need to talk as much as possible at max volume!!  Quick everyone shoot at the scorched across the river for ten minutes straight!!". 
---
Now that I have my farming route down it's not such a problem, but holy crap it was obnoxious trying to figure it out in the first place.
---
Stupid question, what exactly does the vocal sack do? Especially for your frog? Will it just repeat the same two-three lines like our allies?
---
If you're on PC, there is a mod that highlights ore sources with flashy colors.  
---
(at work, so cannot link to nexus)
---
Imo, Ground Pounder 3 is worth running 2/2/2 on commandos
---
I have vats build
---
Yep, nothing new here...
---
Shit, I've been doing it wrong this whole time!! Lol.
---
Okay let's say you can trade it.  It is now the meta, literally the best rifle in game and every single person is mass producing them 2 a day.  Every other rifle is now worth 40 scrip.  There are 20 camps a server with fixers in every machine so fixers are worth a couple of hundred caps at best.  How does this help the economy?
---
While I understand your frustration, I'm guessing you recently found out how much good fixers are worth, we really dont need every single person pumping them out nor do we need to make really good ones easier to acquire.  How lack luster and mediocre to get your god roll fixer and it's the exact same gun every single other person has.
---
I know it happens quite often, to the point where I won't even use VATS. I'm just wasting ammunition if the game isn't registering my hits. I don't experience this bug at all if I do it myself. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
they should have a drop from the purveryor loot pool like fasnacht  did. big team events should always have a guaranteed drop in addition to the boss drop.
---
also maybe a small amount of scrip too, like 2-5 per event.
---
Normal armor can never outperform power armor because of the hidden 42% damage reduction power armor has ...
---
On an old rickety console held together with duct tape and spit.
---
Same. I hit him up every Sunday evening now. I think that’s the safe bet. I hear other people mention bugs if they go a different date that can lock them out for a week or two.
---
Wait food spoils in a vendor???? Are you for real??? Lmaoo thats so fucking stupid jesus why would anyone ever try to sell any then?? Wtf is Bethesda smoking
---
Maybe this is common knowledge, but as a very casual player I don't know all the ins and outs.
---
Why Rifleman and Slugger at 1+1+1 instead of combining? Is it for ease of use when you need to swap in special purpose perk cards?
---
Prior to going bloody I would use a zealots primed explosive gatling gun. it would do pretty decent headshot damage on the queen and one-shot nearly all the adds.  if I went back to full health I'd revert to it.  not that the explosive is my first choice anymore, I'd probably try to find a FFR version.
---
The system is fine the way it is now. Just loot the meat you get from enemies and pick up any boiled/purified water you find. Cook the meat, put the glowing meat steaks in your favorites bar and sell the rest.
---
Ya know, I didn't even really notice.  I think it was a 2* something.
---
i mix it up. I'll server hop a few times until i see a horde event or something like it's a trap or distant thunder as those are quick AF! 
---
on the plus side in the last 20 hours or so i've found about 40k worth of brown, blue and green.
---
Bethesda could learn a thing or too from this!
---
Place two foundations next to each other. Place a door facing in on the interior edge of one and a wall facing in on the other. Change the door to a wall. Now you can put wallpaper on either side. Works with all wall types save for one. Forget which one, sorry. This eats camp budget a bit and op's suggestion would be preferable.
---
Exactly my point. But apparently nobody but you agrees.
---
50%? That’s a nice number... It’s not that high.
---
That doesn't mean it CANT BE.
---
They will be missed. They were my only reason to really play. Otherwise it's collect gold and scrip..
---
If you kit the gun right and it has -25% VATS AP Cost, you can reduce the AP cost down to 1 per shot
---
Sorry to bring doom and gloom into the fold, but I would be more excited for balance, bug &amp; stability fixes more than anything. Besides, I don't really like the new system, I mean, I like the idea, but hate the fact how choice has been taken away from me by awarding us with less atoms and more random crap.  
---
If you're loving the update, good, have fun! I kinda wish I could, but after playing the game for  \~4 months now I have realized how flawed it is on so many different levels.
---
I admit my stash is pretty full, but I have literally hundreds of plans &amp; they take a lot of space. That, with all my shops fully stocked, it adds up. This is why FO1st really saved me. As for being like your sister... maybe I'm your long-lost sister! 😅
---
in seconds? maybe with one of the bugged effects, but the same is true for the gauss minigun if it has the bugged effects. ultracite 2mm is actually more worth it to make than normal 2mm because you get 108 rounds per craft instead of 27. 
---
[this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Tdt4p58p2o&amp;list=PLmVp0DSeGGnAf0WUG9a7bSGoGAcbTljYK&amp;index=3) run he is using the gauss minigun with one of the bugged effects, as you can see, it does a shit ton of damage
---
in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddpSsEnErVc&amp;list=PLmVp0DSeGGnAf0WUG9a7bSGoGAcbTljYK&amp;index=7) run he is using a TS FFR and it's *alright*, but it's a TS and TS are pretty bad, a bloodied one would do a lot better (sadly he doesn't have any vids of a bloodied gauss minigun without the bugged effects)
---
i'm in the middle of looking through the videos, and i just realised that you are talking about bugged effects being great, i didn't realise that medics / junkies / instigating were also bugged, i thought it was only the limb damage and some of the vats effects that were bugged. now i know this, you are talking about bugged weapons being better, which is kinda pointless because they are bugged.. it's like comparing those hacked weapons that 2 shot the queen or shoot mininukes to the gauss minigun and saying the gauss minigun is bad because it doesn't do the same amount of damage
---
[yep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkG9fz0pwR4&amp;list=PLmVp0DSeGGnAf0WUG9a7bSGoGAcbTljYK&amp;index=16) you were right, it does melt the queen, but it's bugged.
---
[another](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKvSoHALwW8&amp;list=PLmVp0DSeGGnAf0WUG9a7bSGoGAcbTljYK&amp;index=18) normal minigun with a bugged effect
---
[this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N8cDWQ0ah8&amp;list=PLmVp0DSeGGnAf0WUG9a7bSGoGAcbTljYK&amp;index=33) is the kind of damage you would see with a non bugged minigun, obviously a bit more if it was bloodied but nowhere near the bugged effects
---
apparently [these](https://prnt.sc/t8ml5r) are all the bugged effects.
---
hasnt that been fixed?
---
Did you not read what I said?
---
They added legendary perks that do the exact same thing
---
But thats only because Bethesda has designed it in that way. It doesn't HAVE to be that way.
---
Looks pretty interesting And would be a major improvement to the game
---
Mirelurk queen enters the chat
---
Log a game ticket, they can resolve the issue.
---
Getting them to might be a crapshoot, but is worth trying.
---
pretty sure that the conversion rates have been revealed/datamined. search around the sub. it's not great, but tbh i don't really care. getting anything in exchange for unused ammo is a win imo, seeing as the great majority of the time it is either left on the corpse or dropped at a train station. 
---
im pretty stoked for the whole seasons system though. hopefully earning SCORE is not ridiculously tedious.
---
doom, gloom and sorrow.
---
 also public teams.
---
Did you see that with the new seasonal ranking system (going live on June 30th) at rank 5 you get an ammo converter, so you can convert unwanted ammo to ammo you need. I'm really excited for it because I also have TONS of ammo that I just vender sell.
---
Sounds interesting but not really interested. Super burned out from this game. More grind isnt gonna make me want to pick it up again.
---
Every update I am literally terrified about things breaking. There's something very wrong with the direction 76 is going. I don't want seasons or even BoS, I want the game to finally be fixed.
---
No it can’t but apparently the damage still increases with demolition expert, like the explosive is already built in
---
I posted about this a few days ago:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hcldfs/we_should_have_bicycles/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf
---
Completely agree, it's a pain to use those perks in Watoga. I've experienced that before looking for books. There's a book on the ground outside of the Medical Center that I nearly never found because of all of the other noise there. 
---
This popped in my mind last night when I was looking for a new location for my camp that was near a few of those ore veins. They're not that hard to find as it is, but something like a perk would make looking for them a whole lot faster.
---
Yup!
---
Nice. So then the best roll would probably be bloodied or junkies less vats cost
---
nah, hes got the wrong RGB colors.
---
Yeah I put all of my plans on my vendor for 1 cap, no matter the plan. I just want them sold and into someone else’s hands (whether to resell or to use doesn’t bother me). I’m always going through my scrap and selling excess stuff and bulking what I can even if it barely helps at all. Though I’d say most of my weight atm is stable fluxes and ammos
---
&gt; Because Fallout wasn't designed for pvp
---
Fallout “wasn’t designed” to be online or multiplayer either...but 76 was, however flawed the implementation. 
---
 Survival mode (r.i.p.)wasn’t perfect and either is Nuclear Winter but both are a blast 99% of the time it proves that PvP in 76 really only needs weapon/armor balancing etc. and pvp factions to bypass the need for slap damage.
---
&gt; They need to completely renovate the entire controls and combat system for pvp if they want to make it work.
---
I can’t say I agree with this at all, but I’m interested in what controls/combat systems you think need a complete rework.
---
FINALLY a supply of shells lol. I hoard caps and drop about 1000 or so on shells often. And now that I know theres a cap and lots of people are at it, well I always hope they haven't reached it because when people drop 1000 caps at my vendor I'm happy hahah I'm usually directly under the bridge too
---
Gotcha
---
and a fucking half wall option!!!
---
The Battle Pass system seems like a cool idea.  I play Fortnite and can see the excitement around a battle pass.  But Bethesda needs to get rid of the Fallout First monthly subscription or make the game free to play to offset costs for players before I see this as anything other than another cash grab attempt by them. 
---
I am curious to see how the battle pass works.  I don't feel this game was designed with a battle pass in mind initially so I am not sure how well it will play out or what changes we are going to see after it is implemented.  This game is being pulled in so many directions right now and I'm not sure what it is trying to be.
---
The only way the game could become truly fixed is to allow modding. Unpaid modders have always done a vastly better job fixing Bethesda games than the paid staff themselves.
---
Nope, he was probably in stealth boy. He can claim the workshop to contest it and then shoot you. Not a hack.
---
Yeah, it just sucks to double do it (Budget is tight enough) to get that effect.
---
It's a Czech backpack I think
---
This has been an issue for me frequently lately i just assumed it was cuz off my inventory causing me to lagg
---
Nice of you to offer this :) Are you on PC?
---
Tip! In every area you get only one daily that will pop. If you don't do the Event, another will pop the next day. If you keep doing this you can have all dailies in an area available. This means that if you do Queen of the Hunt, while all the other dailies are also active, the next day Queen of the Hunt will pop again, and again, and again.
---
He's hoping most people are intelligent and have morals and integrity.
---
I read this title and came here ready to fight. But I agree with what you’re saying here. It’s incredibly frustrating to be chugging water every 15 minutes as I wander around. It’s not a satisfying mechanic, just wastes time.
---
Yessir ign DragonRider1932
---
Oh okay, that’s not as bad
---
No kidding.  I used to have a really good automatic pipe rifle and I would gladly take any free .38 up for grabs, It killed things just fine. Ended up getting rid of it though to consolidate just how many ammo types I was carrying.
---
I'm not waiting around for someone to buy all of this crap .38 and .44 ammo. Shit gets dumped at WS train station.
---
I was excited for the ammo converter.. then i saw the conversion rates. I guess the clean sink will be cool at least. i'm a big fan of secret rooms.. so the fireplace too. Good level 100 reward imo.
---
Indoor fast trav became a non issue once mods were allowed on consoles especially.
---
Workshops are PvP zones. You don’t get wanted just from killing someone. If you try and pick a lock in an owned workshop you become wanted. If you are crouching you don’t show up on the map. 
---
I think I covered everything.
---
My stash box is excited. Holding an extra 500 lbs of ammo I've been saving.
---
Sorry, hadn't had coffee and just felt like the size and bold letters were kind of shouty. Carry on.
---
Gash? British slang?
---
Never will.
---
It only applies to guns that default semi auto, but can be made automatic
---
Make sure you grind your dailies for the fifty or so Atoms before the server maintenance. There's going to be a drought for a while.
---
I have a bloodied, but my “magic” quad or two shot ones do way more damage in vats. Look for one that has any one of these effects: instigating, junkies, 50% limb damage, 33% vats, or 40% bashing. Any one of those is bugged and does way more damage than bloodied, not on the stats screen but test it yourself in VATS to see the bugged numbers
---
The ATOMS always come a few days later.
---
Public test server
---
Edit: Patch 20 is already live there
---
Idk why this reminds me of a missed connections post on craigslist lol
---
Luck doesn't affect crafting. It only affects the Condition of Weapons/Armor you find.
---
Awesome, thanks
---
All Gauss weapons already have the explosive effect.
---
Well shit, that's a downer.
---
Lol. Nah. He was just a low level player and left him some stuff to help out
---
Gotcha, thank you for the info.
---
The thing that was weird about it when this started happening, was that someone else could come along and find the rest of the containers and progress the event. I had one where I initiated the event and got to the point where I couldn't progress, another player showed up and was able to finish collecting them. But, I've been there too where there have been multiple players there scratching their heads about why the event wasn't progressing. Now, I just make sure that I don't have any of them on me if I go to do the event and haven't had the same issue happen since.
---
Except the standard rifle
---
Everyone's working from home, no? Good, hire a few people like Arthmoor (Bethesda god level modder/fixer) which are familiar with this Frankenstein of an engine and let them fix your shit for you, and pay them, of course.
---
if you are (already) wanted, then other players icons do not show on the map.
---
Or, if the player is crouched/hidden, they will not show on the map.
---
Lesson: learn where the workshop zone boundaries are, and stay outside of the zone when you do a defend.  Sniper rifles come in handy for this purpose.
---
I would love to use it if I could turn off all that god damn noise it makes.
---
Id say NOT worth it, with 6lb nuke for 5 caps, bad weight to cost ratio
---
Really don't care if you want a reference other than my opinion. If you'd love a reference you're free to do your own research.
---
I’m on Xbox and not everyone does the base building thing.  I’ve seen level 400+ people with shit bases.  Not me at all,  I love taking a break from the other aspects of the game and building camps for my mules and my friends.  It definitely helps people make a decision as whether they will spend their caps but price and quality of items is important as well. I don’t think I’ve ever not looked in a vendor because of a campus appearance because you just never know.  I just think if your going to have a vendor it would be nice to not frustrate the buyer.  So even if you have no idea how to price stuff at least make it so the vendor is easily accessible for anyone who spawns in at your camp.  I personally appreciate it immensely.  I saw a guy once who had his first vendor literally within reach to access the second you spawned in.  Real mvp there,  camps are cool but sometimes you just want those stims or scrip lol.  No one has to look at your camp but if you put effort in and the shop at least looks nice people like me will definitely poke around.
---
No mirelurk kings are dangerous I do like almost 1.5k a bullet anything I can kill in a few shots before it zee me
---
Just swapped to swift. Joined a SBQ fight. Holy cow what a difference. Got through 3 clips before my AP ran out. Was still doing comparable damage to her. 
---
Thank you.
---
1 cap plans? Are you.... on Xbox? 🤪 That's like telling me you have 300 desk fans, 65 bowling pins, 470 toy aliens! 
---
I bulk a lot of things &amp; so far, after well over a year of playing, I'm the only person I've seen that sells bulk plastic. Plastic is an essential commodity.
---
So is going by scrap boxes.
---
I’m just messing around lol generous people like you are definitely the reason this community is so badass!
---
Just checking it was just your opion. You seemed very sure of yourself. Like it was a fact. Thank you.
---
I dont really do it for that reason, I do it to get rid of them. When someone buys 6 of the 12 I had at once its not about selling them for money lol
---
I make my caps from smaller ammo people seem pretty grateful when they find tons of 5.56 ammo they've probably jumped from shop to shop for. Been there done that. I do it that way to help a person out
---
Most likely due to 1+1+1 giving a 30% bonus (10 + 10 + 10) but combining cards gives 20% total (10 + 5 + 5).
---
Hear that.  Many enemies are so weak that a pipe rifle tears through them.  I just wish the glow sight was improved a bit. Ive got BE and BFFR pipe rifles that actually shred so am happy to help people manage their weight!
---
Very true, because you don't have to be active FO1. I go by how many players I see run to a scrap box after an event.
---
Awesome! Glad I could help! Welcome to the wasteland!!
---
Uh we already receive 90% from player vending.
---
Increasing Stash size for settlers will cause issues
---
I just collect the flares and when I notice I have enough (20 plus) I find a flare gun and just shoot them all off, then scrap the gun.
---
Not sure what happened to my post .. it just disappeared.  
---
Any ideas on the better gun?
---
I could be wrong, but I think demo expert buffs the rifle too.  It has been a bit since I looked into it though.
---
Tbh, I'd chose to max out Vault 76 and Free States. Gain lots of legendaries from the daily event, then switch to Vault 76 and give the new players some legendaries.
---
Leap of Faith room.
---
Ribbit.
---
Honestly? I hate having to repair gear, because it means I have to break off what I'm doing (which is most likely having fun) to return to my camp and mess with my workbenches and if I'm out of any given materials go and collect some, just to get back to having fun. Then again, I'm here for the story/lore and roleplaying, and have always had as little to do with Kill&gt;Loot&gt;Return as I possibly could. If I wanted a survival experience I'd play 7 Days to Die or The Forest. 
---
I'm here for Fallout, and up until FO4 the gameplay 'loop' never felt as intrusive due to how simple crafting was, and even FO4's actual survival mechanics were an optional mode with weapons never breaking. Just my personal take.
---
that would be pretty funny considering how many people made builds around that the last few weeks.. lol
---
This seems likely.
---
She got paid to shut up
---
Thats bs. You shouldnt have to use double budget because you want something that should be in the game already
---
Ah, makes total sense. I haven't really looked that much into alot of those cards since I'm only lvl 35, but it's good to know for the future.
---
the 2 days its going to take me to completely re download the whole game because they cant make there launcher just update the game!
---
It does work on non automatic rifles.
---
Sounds like you do not know what it actually is to run a bloodied build.
---
Maybe you just try it yourself and find out if it is really as boring as you think.
---
This tends to happen to me a lot on my commando build idk if its cuz of the PA glitch or if its due to sneak
---
Fair enough but it's not about wanting a this experience or that experience to me.  Why pigeon-hole it like that?  I don't want to play JUST a survival game.. It's better to me to have an MORPG with survival elements to add flavor.  Don't just give me one type of game, make something different with flavors from different genres.  Give me a NEW experience.
---
My guess would be you crafted something that used the junk and the game took it out of the Display even if u didnt need the one from the display case
---
Power Armor suppresses mutations, hence why certain mutations don’t work while in PA
---
This is quality, but instead of having them fall under good evil just have them all as separate factions and you can only be aligned to 2 at a time
---
Daring to be different: Most days, I prefer my suppressor and vampire lever over the  AA fixer (bought from a player vendor, as I don't have the plan).  
---
Although that might be b/c both levers are also explosive, so ultimately, do a bit more damage than the Fixer.
---
Np :)
---
I kind of expect them to fix these and hope they do. I use one myself but they’ve made every encounter way too easy.
---
Aid is also broken as fuck. Stealth boy and quantum aside, you can get well over 1k healing per second eating select foods
---
The ultracite gating laser is better than the gattling plasma. Higher ammo count, less recoil. Unless the gattling plasma is explosive few people use them
---
It doesn't matter if it's game breaking or not, it's still a glitch and you shouldn't be doing it, whether it's for fun or not
---
literally anything is better than every ammo type that you don't use being actual trash.
---
Not much love for the raiders though, would love to see a dmg bonus vs humans and better rewards for PVP play.
---
Would be legit to get bonus rewards for attacking camps or picking up player loot bags. I know there's a lot of people who would abuse it, just thinking out loud.
---
Would make having more PVP events like monster mash more relevant.
---
Buy a legacy / duped weapon...that's what a lot of those guys did.
---
Riding Shotgun you can start on your own anytime!  Although I think there is an hour cool down in between.
---
*snort
---
The devs run a side hustle selling them on EZNPC
---
Don’t tell me you’ve never used a little glitch here and there for fun, because pretty much everybody has. And 80% of the people here are dupers and 99% of the people here deal in duped weapons.
---
They're fixed on the PTS, so most likely.
---
Someone please tag the Bethesda community manager
---
Power armor in PVP isnt very good.
---
Lol thanks for that man, they should just take the word “automatic” off the perk card...
---
It was not, i can't buy them yet as i'm not an ally.
---
Same here. I'm kinda wondering if this new system will keep my interest.
---
I got doubts.
---
Don't use pa. Stealth boys and quad teslas. Or legacy weapons.
---
Or just don't pvp haha. I stay away from it at all costs. 1k+ hours in I think I've done it once, and it was actually a decent experience. Guy wanted to see what it was like to go against the sh set. We chatted afterwards
---
It's ruining everyone else's fun just to flex.  Get thee to a private server with that.
---
Given the camp system, any bluffs to it would be op. People love the building aspect so stash and camp upgrades would be the faction people flock too. I think a bonus to farming crops and cooking then should be double exp or something. Same with blue ridge, maybe +50 caps for quest competition. The max right now is 150 so a bump to 200 would work. As it stands now with the OP's post, foundation outshines everything and the other faction perks are meager in comparison.
---
And when it goes beyond 4 hours - “OMG why is it taking so long”
---
That's what I figured. Even though my scrap box has plenty of supplies. Was curious if this was an ongoing issue or if it's just me.
---
So Good = Weak
---
Evil = Strong
---
Neutral = Not bad
---
Lever actions are awesome, i picked up a low level quad 15% faster reload lever action on my stealth rifleman and it saw me through from around level 25 to a bit over 50, I've been keeping my eyes peeled for it's predecessor ever since.
---
Depending on what they're planning to do in the pause between seasons its either a drought for a while or forever.
---
If only we could meet Julie and get a second settler daily from her...
---
Nope I tried it after I saw that the new gauss stuff has explosive so unless they changed it recently the rifle still doesnt. Imo it doesn't really need it
---
you need legendary gear and perks that reduce damage by percentage, like dodgey and serendipidy, or sentinal and cavalier armor
---
those damage reductions are far more effective than damage resistance
---
also a big part of pvp is to take advantage of aid items obviously stimpacks, but nuka cola quantum can stack so if you drink 4 or five of them you have a large amount of healing going on for quite some time
---
you need to survive their attacks until they hav to reload and at the right time you then counterattack
---
obviously there are countermeasures to certain tactics and some op stuff like legacy plasmas that are pretty much impossible to counter other than keeping distance
---
pvp in this game is in an odd place, where for those who are well equipped (and were talking 100s of thousand of caps worth of weapons/armor/aid) 
---
pvp is a very complex and intense part of the game,
---
whereas for over 90% of the playerbase they stand no chance to a point where trying isnt worth it and its really hard to get into pvp
---
&gt; workshop
---
Well there's your answer
---
Good video, solid 8/10. Reminded me of how terrified I was of the show as a kid.
---
Rolling pin hands down. 😁😁😁😁😁
---
I believe it's 3 to 1.
---
Lol bladed or spiked?
---
Something something servers something suck
---
pick your poison
---
Yo so a bit of information that's not know so the armor rating has a reducing return with a higher damage resistance for instance. Enemies attack stat is 200 your damage resistance is 200 you would negate 50% damage at 500 damage resistance you would negate 63% of damage and at 2000 damage resistance you would negate 73% mixed set of hunters, zealots, ghoul slayers, exterminators, mutant slayers, and troubleshooters would give u a better armor rating then say a vanguards. Let me know if you need clarification on this cause it can be a little difficult to understand
---
I dont have Fallout 1st so icant rly help u with that one but hopefully someone else can help
---
I highly doubt it will for me. There's no way I can push out 200 hours every 3 months. I've had it for a year and barely have 800... Bethesda sucks. :(
---
Enclave forever!!! Down with the commie Free States!!
---
No need to be sorry thats your opinion. I honestly have not had any problems except the vendor/display case issue a few weeks ago...and lets be honest that was not Beths fault...its was the arsholes who doopy doop
---
Nope, extra damage its just a bonus. With uny gear u have ALOT of special points (minus endurance). Strength - alot of carry weight and melee dmg, alot of agi - action points and sneak, alot of int - faster leveling and better condition of crafted items, alot of perception - vats hit chance, alot of charisma - NPC prices and rewards from group events, alot of luck - mostly for faster crit meter filling. Just can't pass those extra stats, while you can be tanky as hell with right build, and dont forget emergency protocols with PA. 
---
Tl.dr - can't pass carry weight and special stats
---
Omg I missed out on the cutest bag, is it still available?!
---
Got a 3* one the other day from Charleston and scripped it
---
I’d go for AP and weights reduced or special bonuses like agility, and I’d maybe look into thorn armor if your going for stealth just for the extra sneak bonus.
---
To me it IS a fact, just like your opinion IS apparently a fact to you. Just read all the posts on here asking about how to cancel 1st, or what they're able to keep after cancelling. Or how to refund a cancellation. People with active 1st accounts are the minority. Boxes at camps mean nothing.
---
There's sometimes a delay. Usually sorts itself out within a day.
---
Thanks, I get it!
---
I hear it is a nice bar, except for the fact that the dancer constantly complains about headaches. It can be a turn off for some people. So, 4/5 stars
---
Yeah I was disappointed that they were getting rid of it, but hopeful that it meant a total rework might be coming.  
---
The real problem with consumables is that it all rots too fast and the benefits are too low for it to be a part of any build. 
---
No one wants to spend the first hour of their session gathering ingredients for a trivial buff that only lasts a half hour before you have to do it again because the rest of the ingredients spoiled.
---
I'm actually in possession of a pretty decent bloodied fixer...and I still think it's a load of crap. 
---
Now, with that being said...I think you and I both know that would never happen, the fixers being worth a few hundred caps. I think that is a bit exaggerated. 
---
Why would it be so bad that all weapons be driven down a bit? The cap is 30k. The intention was, nothing should have been worth more than that....then come presents and duping...the economy is clearly broken. It is clear to me that you acknowledge that, so why would this be so bad? Just because we all paid more for our fixers (either the grind or trades) and that would drive the price down on them, doesn't mean it shouldn't happen...
---
The whole thing is greedy and fucking boring tbh.
---
I dont know how you can even play without a scrap box.  Going to unsub because at level 60 and solo there is absolutely nothing keeping me playing
---
nope. the only "difficulty" bethesda adds to enemies is making them bullet sponges, bloodied vastly negates bullet sponge enemies and makes the game more fun. it's not fun to use a minigun on a supermutant and wait for what seems like an age for them to die, i like damage systems where you do a lot of damage but also take a lot of damage, like the hardcore mode in CoD bo2 multiplayer. it's even less fun when you realise how much materials crafting ammo costs and then think about how much ammo you use (even on bloodied builds), when crafting materials take up valuable space in your finite stash *unless* you shell out for fo1st in order to get a feature that should be free for everyone.
---
1h combat knife, 2h sheep staff, unarmed power fist
---
damn man
---
i hope you find a fix 
---
wish you luck 👍🏼
---
Hope not. Just started using by B3325 Combat yesterday, and, it is sufficient
---
No they no the exact conversation on all ammo types some guy posted a spreadsheet of the conversation sadly I dont remember the name of the post
---
I have a super sledge called All Rise. I'm pretty sure I got it for completing a quest. It has the heavy rocket mod.
---
I can't find that rad removing shower! I need it for my camp.
---
No claiming, they usually show up 1-3 days after you recieve the mail (at least for me). Guess payment processing/clearance takes some time.
---
I've played the game for 1k+ hours and never needed a turret. Not much comes by. And when it dose it doesn't break much. Also the new allies will defend your camp
---
Staff from protecting cows?
---
That's flawed too. I run to the tents too, to drop in my junk to my storage, so unless you're standing there eyeing each and every person AND asking if each and every person just used the 1st box, then that's just your opinion as well.
---
Haha I like that very much
---
I expect they will be patched out although you won't know for sure until the patch notes are posted and players confirm...and then they'll be a fluffy of posts complaining about 'Needless Nerfs!', 'Haven't they got better things to fix?', Bethesda killed my character...the usual moans - that's how you know they are fixed.
---
If I'm feeling lazy, I use my Junkies FFR 50cal and a Junkies Cryo to freeze her. With stabilized and basic perks I think it does 24 or so per shot to her head. If I want to do real damage, I use a bloodied power attack gauntlet in a stealth suit which can do over 3,000 per hit in the nerd rage and buffs.
---
The plan drops from that. But it's the staff, not the crook
---
Yeah I’ve had that to but the one I have is currently better than that.
---
In Max Brooks "Zombie Survival Guide" a whole chapter is discussing transportion. Conclusion: perfect means of transport is a bike.
---
We could start with a basic frame, unlock bags, have suspension upgrades, unlock challenges for biking 76000 miles....
---
I dunno about the physic aspect when it comes to programming, and looking at all that holes in the roads it's gonna be tough to get it realistic, but i would love bikes and trade in fast travel for this at any time!
---
It is from an in game plan that right now is only obtainable through trading. Be warned it's not cheap
---
It’s personal preference really. If you’re camping in a spot where you frequently get attacked, you may want to use a few. Personally, I scout out my camp locations before building to see how safe they are. I prefer to not use turrets as they eat into the budget so much.
---
What are public teams? A looking for group feature?
---
I keep looking because my character is built on strength and intelligence, so far that and the Hunter's Grognak Axe are my best.
---
All rise is a decent starter weapon. But pretty much any legendary sledge or super edge will be better
---
Also major gutsy have a 100% armor piercing, so not matter how high ur defense is they still will wreck but with a troubleshooters set on you would negate 75% of there damage and be a good at events like encrpytid
---
Well everyone in game I told thanked me for the info and immediately removed the free ammo so it seemed like somthing to share but of course theres always someone like you that wants to take it the wrong way and wants to be a little panty waste about it
---
Is Buttressed the best SS Armor mod?
---
Last few months. The effects have been broken atleast 6 months.
---
Yeah I used to use a grognak axe but I put a custom Stanley skin on it and glitched it forever.
---
Now I use war drums.
---
You rarely die from single hits though. Should have been tested with multiple shots, like he did with the Empath mutation test
---
Using our current per cards and somehow enabling us to make certain ones legendary would be a better avenue to take. From what I've seen from the new legendary perk cards the way they're worded is rather obscure as to their effects.
---
It realy depends on the location of cour Camp and what kind of spawnpoints are close to it. In my case for example I have a high chance of Supermutants rampaging through so I set up two heavy  missile-turrets and even then they mannage to do some noticable damage every now and then.
---
At last I’ll get some stash space back when I scrip my collection of magic heavies!
---
No trying to be a downer, but you are missing the helmet, which has one bright flashlight.
---
Right, I knew I saw this abbreviation before 🙂 Thanks
---
I'll see if I can get my hands on one. I am level 81 for reference, not as far in the game as a lot of people
---
But I need online validation in order to give my empty life meaning :(
---
No problem :)
---
The distant thunder event in the cranberry bog has a lot of scorched you can kill for weapons.
---
they shouldn't be under the good factions, they only took in females while turning away males who had nowhere to go. 
---
spoiler for MoM questline:
---
&gt;!if you paid attention in the MoM story you learn about how one of the raiders was actually turned away as a kid / teenager while his female friends were taken in by the MoM people, he had no friends left and nowhere to go but to the raiders. https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Brody_Torrance i wonder how many people were faced with similar circumstances. MoM got what they deserved !&lt;
---
\*Agrees in ESO\*
---
False.
---
I recently developed a bloody build and I find it really interesting trying to figure out ways of not getting killed or dying than any of my heavy builds. It will increase your reflex actions during the game that is for sure.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf
---
1 hit vs multiple hits wouldn't change the numbers. He did it with the hardest hitting static spawn you can find.
---
If you take 3 extra damage per hit if you took 10 hits that'd be 30 extra damage. So no other testing needed.
---
But if you are against a weaker hitting enemy, like most things in game, and running lone wander and or emergency protocols that damage difference would be less if there was any difference at that point
---
is it now? well i’m sorry for the false info then
---
Honestly, I’d rather not add yet another layer of grind to getting the perfect armor by giving PA legendary effects. Instead, I’d like a set bonus for each set that is strong enough to compete with legendary effects.
---
Radiation rumble. I can farm a good amount of junk items, nuclear materials and glowing blood. The glowing blood fetches a decent price when you have a large stack.
---
You may be getting ahead of yourself there. Yes, XP gives score, but crucially we don’t yet know the XP&gt;Score ratio.
---
You can't find it actually, you have to beat the Scorchbeast Queen to unlock it!
---
Phooey TmT
---
You got all the melee perks already or Andrenaline?
---
you get the "improved repair kit" on events all the time, I manage to get 25 so far it give a second cnd bar, don't spend your atoms at repair kits not worth
---
edit: I'm melee just hit lvl 55 and at least I can't 2 shot some enemies but overall they fall pretty quickly, assaltron/radiated ghoul those I run like a kid lost at supermarket after his mum
---
I've had it since right when BIV and his brewing stuff were introduced.
---
I think I'm at like 1600 but that's a lot of idle time while I just have my shop open.
---
I hope I like these changes. Guess we'll find out tomorrow.
---
Let me know what you think after a day or two of it.
---
Here's hoping.
---
Plan drops from the queen.  Takes a good amount of flux to craft too.
---
This is Bethesda. They change those numbers and suddenly no events spawn, mobs stop dropping legendaries and your camp budget goes down to zero. Every time they "fix" something, something else breaks.
---
I ended up removing my turrets because they would glitch out and disappear and because they take up so much budget. Instead, I placed my ally outside the house so that now she defends off against most things. However, sometimes I do have issues where I spawn into camp and have to fight off some mobs or I return to camp and have to make a couple of repairs.
---
I MUST HAVE MOTHMAN. I. NEED. TO. JOIN.
---
 MY. CULT.
---
Not sure about 'all' to be honest.
---
15*5 is 60. Granted, it’s situational, but add sentinel to that and you’re practically invincible because you’re getting that again. Now, Uny/sent or Van/sent or even better for PvP ass/sent. Now tell me PA is better than legendary armor.
---
I always carry a .38 fixer for low levels , I keep my .45 and 5.56 for top tier enemies
---
I had a similar issue but I think I scrapped it one day I didn’t have my camp setup on login.
---
Started a tank build on day one. It evolved into an unarmed bloody. It's a hybrid build that starts high damage resistance. The more damage I get, the more powerful my attacks are.  It's O.P. to the point not fun. To challenge myself. I created a food build. No combat skills, the opposite. A walking department store.
---
The abomination will reak havok on Appalachia starting tomorrow and im NOT looking forward to it.
---
West tek is where I go to kill and collect for my daily caps
---
Oh wow, that's good to know. Hey one of my dailies is screwed up and won't start, the huntmaster at black bear lodge won't start his daily on my main for weeks now. Do you know how to fix it?
---
Think it’s worse around  5-1
---
no it wouldn't, even in NW the pvp suffers from a buggy engine jerry rigged to run pvp at a barely tolerable level. the legacies are not the problem, the engine is not designed for pvp and it shows. i used to think destiny pvp was bad until i played fo76 lmao
---
It's a shame a lot of the world challenges are broken, never know they might be fixed tomorrow! Fingers crossed!
---
I only get to spend a couple of days a week playing for a decent length of time, the rest I was logging in for 15-20 mins for the dailys
---
It is most definitely an opinion. I want some actual numbers.
---
What is the purpose of waiting until downtime begins to post patch notes?
---
settlements in fo4 function far better than pvp in fo76
---
Anything that involves sales or trades is likely to get removed under rule 10. Anyhoo, gatling plasmas do more damage per hit but suffer from shocking recoil even with stabilized. Gatling lasers do less per hit but are easier to handle and with power user hold 999 shots per reload assuming a full core. Plasmas are easier to craft ammo for but you can farm fusion cores from the power plants but that's best done on a private server.
---
 Pros and cons to both. Personally I use lasers but I've had better luck getting those than plasmas to drop.
---
The TV makes me think of Futurama and the Hypnotoad. Love it! ❤❤❤
---
I just hope I can still enjoy these new features alongside a busy life and last of us 2 😅
---
As a magic weapon user, I’m cool about them fixing them...and I have a lot of said weapons (mainly shotties) it was a fun few weeks for me while it lasted.....now to actually bash some enemies to death and see how that goes. Lol 😂😂😂
---
In my opinion there needs to be more alignments though coz like you put enclave and crater raiders as evil which is subjective, you didn't mention the blood eagles which are full evil raiders, where as I would say crater are more chaotic neutral enclave I feel like maybe would be lawful evil because they are the US government in AI form right ? And aren't BoS like super against them so calling them neutral isnt really right at that point but it would just sort most factions into their own separate category so maybe it wouldn't work so great idk
---
Excited to the point where I purposefully bought out an entire vendors stock of .38 (while the owner thanked me for it).
---
Also: mini nukes and missiles now have an actual purpose!
---
All two handed melee weapons do +amount of damage, there’s like a 3 card set to maximize melee damage
---
Also if you use a one handed melee weapon there is also a set for one sanded melee damage.
---
Andrenaline perk card increases damage per consecutive kill by +10% and has 5 different ranks
---
I tried like over 40 times and still only have a chest piece
---
Yeah
---
It's really fun - the reason I play fo76. I don't wear any armour and my gatling is explosive. I'm really putting the glass in glass cannon.
---
Is the battle pass free
---
Hate to break it to you, but you’re pretty much as far from BoS as you can get.
---
Oh shit this happened to me last night I thought that’s what happened.
---
I don't consider my opinion fact, it's just that an opinion. I was looking for some factual information. You are obviously not a good method of finding a source. Thanks anyways.
---
It's a known issue that for no sane reason the game prioritizes junk items over scrap when it comes to crafting or repairing. No idea if and when it's likely to get changed.
---
&gt;would prefer Fallout 76 to be as close to a Fallout 3 or 4 experience as possible 
---
Me too, which is honestly why I welcome this coming change. Fallout 3 had no hunger/thirst system and weapon wear was easily modded out (or your fav modded to 99999 condition) and nowhere near as punishing as some weapons in 76. Fallout 4 also had no hunger/thirst system unless you opted into it and weapons never broke. Even NV had survival mode be a toggle, likely the inspiration behind the option in 4. Eating and drinking in 76 has, as has been noted often in the thread, a poorly implemented system where you are dissuaded from putting effort into cooking complex recipes because they rot and end up just breaking up your experience to gather and open menus to avoid debuffs.
---
I've definitely done the two handed weapon perks. I don't think I have adrenaline so I'll go work on that next time I'm playing. Thank you!
---
People have been cleaning my machines out like mad for the past two weeks. I have hit max caps 3 or 4 times and I was watching carefully but people have been dumping caps into my machines so quickly that I can't spend them fast enough.
---
Yeah, I'm not bothering with the helmet, I know about it but for 1650 for a bright flashlight that has no benefit is.. ehh plus I prefer sunglasses lol
---
i didn't notice a difference between unmodded ultracite and unmodded T-65
---
Could you please send me a link of the post :)
---
That is unfortunate
---
Yes, please! One of my favorite stories in the game, and it was much too short. I wish it had repeat quests.
---
Upvote for killbeavers!  Fierce little buggers.
---
Yeah it’s really good for clearing out hordes of bitch ghouls
---
I basicly play like this now, I have a pioneer scout/ settler character,
---
And a crater raider/ burglar character, that I use to rob other player junk extractors and ammo machines.
---
I'd love a system that encouraged this sort of gameplay to all players.
---
Ty, but I'm on xbox
---
Lot of torn wrapping paper rolling around WVA.  How hilarious would it be if Bethesda added wrapping paper tumbleweeds into the environment?
---
You're absolutely right. If they wanted to have some sort of competitive mode that was actually balanced, they'd be best off making it two teams competing which each other to complete objectives, but not directly fighting each other. It would also be best if players were given predetermined loadouts, otherwise you end up with the problem of certain builds always winning due to enemies being instantly deleted by them.
---
Before I go any further please note I am a heavy weapons and demo spec.  I dont even own a fixer cause its worthless to me so I dont have a dog in this show.
---
It's not about keeping the value in fixers.  What you are suggesting would collapse the entire economy around rifles.  It would make every other rifle type worthless except for scriping. And the only rifle that still has value would rapidly lose it as there are now thousands of them all circulating until people are throwing them in with trades like we see with certain plans that got duped into valuelessness.
---
Nothing really, i was looking forward to legendary perk to give me a reason to farm, the daily scrip cap is done in 30 minutes, theres very little content for me now.
---
How could it be?
---
Yeah it hasn't dropped for me yet
---
This happens to every friendly robot, even in the whitesprings bunker
---
Thanks.
---
Thank you for the information!
---
:(
---
&gt; Otherwise it's collect gold and scrip..
---
Sadly its only like 30 minutes of content per day.
---
Mole Miners are my favorite.... to murrrrrrderrrr.
---
You’ve got to understand both ‘balance’ and ‘fix’ spell as ‘N, E, R, F’ in Bethesda’s dictionary. Eventually they will come out and fix the Fixer and send our grinds down the drain.
---
If I'm traumatized, everyone getting traumatized as well 0\_o
---
Sometimes it takes a day or two but they always come in eventually.
---
food is staying, the only thing that's going is negative consequences for not eating / drinking. you will still get buffs from being well fed and hydrated
---
Thank you.  Thought that might be the reason.  I may go with the laser.
---
Constantly having to open your inventory is bad as it is with the game giving you missiles, grenade launcher ammo, useless weapons and stuff directly to your inventory without your consent.  I HATE having to open my inventory constantly to eat some random stuff.  
---
Not every player likes this. You can still find your motivation to eat if they disable the debuffs but keep the buffs (and level up well fed challenges) but forcing players who hate doing this to eat/well is for some players the most annoying thing.
---
This is brilliant. I'd fucking love it if there was factions/some sort of clans to join.
---
I'm pretty sure that's been bugged for forever! And Hemlock Holes aswell.
---
But for real, *why* is it taking so long? None of the games I play take this long to apply patches.
---
Just here to put in another vote for Order of Mysteries! One of my favorite story lines in the game.
---
Same here. I'm thinking I need a Schwinn-style Red Rocket model...
---
But, yeah, now that you mention it, it was Brooks that I first heard the idea from. I had almost forgotten about that book.
---
Shoot. It seems I get all the bugs in my main.
---
David Bowie knows. Ch Ch Ch Ch Changes!
---
I totally missed that post, but you hit the points way better than I could have.
---
I am guessing that people will use the God-mode glitch or some other exp gaining glitch first day to get to rank 100 within an hour or so. Bethesda will not do anything about it. The rest of the people (who are honest) will be forced to do things the grindy way.
---
I still see it going for 10k on PC
---
What? I'm responding to the person who thinks you can't put wallpaper on a window wall.
---
There are a few behind station delta, east of, I think.
---
Honestly I love the idea and it would add a lot of ideas and much more versatility and roleplay aspect to the game rather than what we currently have. I’d also like to see the inclusion of faction specific rewards and skins and camp building object to help you better represent the faction you have joined. There should also be a thing where if you join the responders or settler you can’t join the raiders and vice versa. Make it so your decisions have some consequences like in Warframe and how their factions work. In Warframe if you join a faction, the opposing faction will grow increasingly hostile towards you and sometimes on missions you will have enemies set after you en mass and they can do significantly more damage to you than the normal enemies of the level.
---
Fast traveling to the overseers house then zoning into the house is a little annoying
---
Bought it on the market sub for 7k this morning. If you found it for 600 caps I'd snap it up quick.
---
That's what I had figured. I had picked it up for 9k and thought it was a good deal.
---
Bloodied isn't ideal for PvP. Power armor can work but it's not as good as a decent Assassin's Sentinel set. I would try to find a legacy laser or gatling plasma. Teslas can get the job done but they are kind of boring. Are you running Refractor, Dodgy, Lone Wanderer or Suppressor?
---
I think they should add secondary mods to pa.  So on chest you have basic ones (emergency protocols, ap regen, jetpack, they could add mayby some mod that gives flat bonus to health or resistances to poison/elements so we have meaningful choice not just EP).
---
Also there could be secondary mods and here would be all that almost no1 uses: autostim, longer chems, no radiation from food, some stats mayby.
---
It would give us some choice in tweaking PA. I still think they should add something like backpack/storage options to pa. They should work like high capacity backpack-you get storage but they give -dr. Just more choices.
---
Massive issues and bugs that are never fixed. Wastlelanders made it better but there is much to work with for the devs here.
---
Maybe they’re fixing the infinite budget glitch
---
Don’t mind this person I think it looks great !
---
Great idea, and I love being able to sell from your fridge. However you should remember a lot of people use speed demon and it significantly impacts how much you need to eat and drink. I’d also like to add that humans aren’t running all the time, in game you just pushing the thumb stick forward is running and when you press down you are sprinting. So I would argue that you’re burning off a lot more energy than you would in real life. Just wanted to point that out.
---
depends on where you are, how you build, and how much rebuilding you want to do.
---
Build on the west side of the map, you get low level enemies/low damage to your camp.
---
build near the divide (even on the forest side), and you'll get every enemy the game can offer.
---
I build inside a power transmission tower, just to the west of the divide/forest boundary.  while the structure, it contents, and any guests/shoppers are protected from most ground based things, those ground based things still destroy my crops, purifier, and acid extractor.
---
Used to be the worst I got was the occasional L10 supermutant (turrents optional), but that's changing -  over the last several months, the level and type of creature I get has mutated - along with the L1 molerats, I now get things ranging from from L35 vengeful mothmen to L68 legendary radscorpions to 2x L80 legendary SB's (simultaneously).  In those cases, turrets help.
---
I was just saying to me it sounded like they might have been talking about interior walls where the wallpaper can go on both sides of the wall (or window)
---
Who needs fun when you can have tedium?!?
---
where you been for a month or more?
---
Good to know, I rarely use my PA so I won't be in a hurry to grind the T-65 by the sounds of things.
---
Nah, just remove it already, it sucks anyway.
---
I've got some popcorn ready for visiting Reddit tomorrow.
---
What do you mean
---
I know what you mean!
---
That ammo converter is gonna  hangs the game and the amount of ammo out there. Hopefully it makes some of the more expensive ammo more readily available and cheaper.
---
yea i’d probably stay in the vault covenant forever lol
---
Yes, I agree that it requires adding an option. In my mind, I was thinking keeping the map the same as it is now and for locations with an interior, just add an extra option to the already-present confirmation:
---
* Outside (previously OK)
---
* Inside
---
* Cancel
---
nope im picking enclave
---
Thank you. I see the big downside though about the landscape and things around you loading in. I use speed demon and when I sprint I have to stop and wait a bit for the area to load. So I get it. It just sucks. Bikes would be great.
---
I agree everyone should have a lot more storage if not just an unlimited resource container
---
I wouldnt put too much stock on what "everyone" says on a sub reddit - they're notorious echo chambers.
---
According to this sub, noone has 1st and wouldnt dream of giving bethesda money.
---
According to r/fallout noone plays this game anyway and its utter trash. Maybe play it if theres a free weekend to see how bad it is.
---
Meanwhile filthycasuals is full of "check out my cool outfit!"
---
Now I dont have any figures. So I have no idea how many people do/dont have first. But I sure do see a lot of survival tents.
---
I mean the alternative is to play the game and rank up the Season that way.
---
I also forget about my crits, all the bloody time. Your build is similar to mine, and it looks like you've got all the standard boxes ticked. 
---
I run fireproof and gun fu and only have one rank of concentrated fire, but the finer points are all personal preferences really.
---
To each their own and no play style is wrong! Personally, I couldn't care less about the combat in Fallout games. I like the world of Fallout and the lore/ world-building therein. I'm an explorer, scavenger, builder, collector, and only occasionally do I dabble in combat because I *want* to... Usually on DXP weekends.
---
Brutal. It’s funny cause I can roll any other price multiple times in the same session. But unyielding is a different beast altogether.
---
 And another hacker.

Right?!
---
Hey sorry for the late reply, had to go do some personal stuff. If you're on now and willing to open it up that's good with me :)
---
I have a private world, if you need it
---
I like my FSS ghoul slayer switchblade and its little friend, a vampire switchblade.
---
the latter has been my primary for about 140 levels, the former is a got during faschnacht addition, but it's my goto in WS and most nuke zones.
---
(Now if I could just find a FSS vampire switchblade....
---
Morgantown would be the place to nuke if you’re wanting a lot of cobalt.
---
Sorry for the late reply, I had some personal stuff to do, if you are on now and willing to go on a private then I'd be more than happy to join and try :)
---
Whats that? Lol
---
I don't see how you get that, but whatever.
---
If that's okay with you then yes please, are you on now?
---
I'm glad it would cost that much to skip everything, we don't need the wallet warriors gleefully skipping thru.
---
This is a damn Play to Win model, omfg!
---
Edit:  holy shit this is whooshing over people.
---
PLAY to win, meaning you have to play the game to get rewards.  It’s a joke, son.
---
Yasssss perfect!

here comes the low lvl bullet sponges !
---
Also stop Opening doors. My Vendors and crafting stations are outside so why are you entering my building?
---
Rant complete.
---
*post apocalypse* America's Ass!
---
Awesome stuff. But they purposely blur the lines of good and evil. Makes for more interesting gameplay and just like life the lines aren't always clear and there's more than one side to every story.
---
Gatling plasma has higher damage per shot. Gatling laser has a faster fire rate and you can get 1000 shots out of a core with power user. I personally prefer the gatling plasma.
---
What platform are you on? Posts looking for trades get deleted usually.
---
I posted this same question last week because I could not find any either. Some helpful people said nuke white springs or Morgantown. Morgantown had a bunch right as I spawned in.
---
Along with a story about how they "found" 5000 christmas presents and accidently opened them all.
---
Yeah they are a pain, especially the full unyielding thing, but.. I built for stealth rifleman so its that or 40 levels of respeccing, gradually becoming worse and worse.
---
No way, my bffr combat shotgun can take down basically anything in one hit from a medium distance, the gauss shotgun melts everything at 
---
 basically any distance. I think the only really useless weapons are pistols, even the gauss pistol is terrible given the state of vats.
---
Please explain to a noob
---
Yea I agree with this
---
“Go ahead eat that 25 year old canned dog food found in a nuclear dump” “you better eat that damn cranberry relish fast or so help me Todd it will rot and I will kill you if the disease doesn’t”
---
By nature, you move a slower in PA than out of it.  
---
Weight issues may also slow you down a  bit, too.
---
But Speed demon is probably working normally.  Its one of those subtle ones - you will notice it both in and out of PA if you accidentally lose it.
---
Aye. was watching a film but that can wait. I can fix my vendors cos it removed everything. 
---
GT?
---
Yeah, GT is dataDyne087
---
Yeah. I use the machine for creating 5.56 for my sniper who uses a Handmade. They sure go as quickly as they come heh :)
---
This is accurate. And its much more interesting this way.
---
Don't build your camp near a spawn node. I haven't used a turret in a year+
---
I don’t feel the Enclave was evil.  I feel the Enclave is neutral.
---
Okay mine is dankilsbyyyy, I'll add you now
---
Honestly, Its kinda bad game design, from a purely melee perspective you can either:
---
Go Bloodied, Have +20STR(unyieldingx5 and radicool) that deals 40% extra damage from adrenal and nerd rage and +80% damage from bloodied, hitting things for a thousand damage ignoring armor... (remember that strength adds bonus melee damage too) --- and with the right grinding STILL pretty tanky...
---
Or you can go junkies and get +50% damage and be full health, but kill things probably 20% as fast.
---
They haven't designed a whole lot of alternatives into the game either, either you get left in the dust, most legendary prefixes on weapons and armor are just sub-optimal, and kind of terrible.
---
From a ranged perspective its even worse, when you're able to reach out and one shot things, they're not still coming at you, being tanky doesn't matter at all (but again as someone pointed out Emergency protocols in a power armor chest makes you VERY tanky)
---
I would LOVE more options, but really your choices are fairly limited.
---
I tried both, and Unyielding is the thing that did it for me, walking around with a perm +15 to int makes me level faster, and on a melee I hit as hard as snipers once I get there, with my +15 Agility I get to sneak without perks most of the time, and get those melee kills. Heck most of the time I use a vampires melee weapon instead of a bloodied, cause really its not needed to do anymore damage, switching to bloodied only for queens.
---
Haha! Some of those missed connections on craigslist are hilarious. I've always wondered if it's worked out for someone who's posted in that section.
---
Ahhh right that might be it. Hope it comes back I like the doors it came with
---
That's further fetched than some Raiders maybe veering off from their Nuka destiny in order to find treasure in Appalachia...😁
---
The OP wants more Raider gear in-game and likes the designs from FO4. Bastardise it, swap the colours, it's not too hard...
---
sorta.
---
there will be 6 different types of public teams, each with a different stat/xp bonus based off of how many people join.
---
they have a blue icon on the map and a new tab in the social menu
---
This plus a proper interior stair with left, middle and right orientation
---
Having to use a fat middle staircase or a 1x2 square block of stairs with obstructing legs and a forced mesh floor.
---
I don't get why people will pay big caps for plans you can still get by playing the game.  It's much more satisfying to get them after completing an event.
---
Someday that rad barrel plan will be mine...
---
She spawns (wanders) randomly across the map, I found her when I was fighting the SQB. She’s kind rare like the responders bot, lemonade mr handy or graham.
---
Always nice when you realise the FO community not only shares interest in the same games, but reads the same literature
---
Food should just spoil faster in general, and make ice boxes and freezers worth buying apart from decor purposes by making food in the freezers not spoil and drink go ice cold
---
That's the root of the problem. 
---
There's too much imbalance between weapons armor and perk combinations. If you have the highest DPS meta building the moment nearly nothing will prevent you from losing unless you have the absolute perfect combination gear and loadout in response on top of being at least decent and it not being a surprise or trap kill. 
---
The few people who did nothing but focus on PVP would absolutely kill everyone else, which while not unrealistic at all in a real world environment, doesn't make for fun gaming experience. It's like playing as a permanent noob in every single FPS game. It's always going to suck.
---
That's why NW was created, trying to balance that out, but then it looks like they abandoned that effort as well once hackers figured out too many exploits and they haven't seemed to be able to get it back under hand, at least on PC which again makes for an unenjoyable experience. 
---
End of the day, games are supposed to be fun and except for the very elite few, PVP in 76 just isn't that.
---
Yo sorry for the delay, been working away. Just checked my plan mule and he hasn't got reactive sorry! It's protocols he has, I must've mixed the two up.
---
Yes it is free. However you can buy levels for atoms...at 150 each level....but yes the pass is free
---
Where we dropping boys? Oh wait wrong game
---
You'll have to add me back or else Im unable to join
---
I love it when I'm out doing stuff and my I feel my caps increase and my stash lighten.
---
It definitely felt like it should have had some daily quests, what with the terminal quest issuing system and all that.
---
Fixers different imo because people want the plan ASAP so it gets added to the legendary loot pool. I agree with most other plans and stuff in the game, easy enough to grind out yourself except some of the super rare ones.
---
Mutant slayer
---
It was available yesterday. Did you check under floor decorations? It’s at the bottom of that category. The trailer and door share the same item space, just have to hit left or right
---
Not sure why people care so much, but if your (work)shop is outside you always have the option to lock the doors?  
---
Every “problem” knows two sides.
---
I can think of one near station delta, that's about it.
---
How do you make that build???
---
you will definitely not be put out if you don't use it, i have to get the best gear because im a stat whore. you might notice a minor difference if you are really doing a proper test but i think a dude even did one of those and it was like a 1 damage per shot difference or something ridiculous like that. i do however recommend the gauss minigun if you use heavy weapons, very fun to use, only problem is ammo
---
Pvp - junkies switchblade, bloodied mr handy, sacrificial blade
---
Pve - powerfist
---
Well tested over many combinations of perk load outs/gear.
---
Aye, you get shed loads of cobalt there.
---
I’m of the camp that think just removing the survival elements of the game would make it more fun.
---
With care and love
---
I believe what RF is saying is numerous posts about this have already been made over the last 30 days.
---
I used to have Concentrated Fire 1 when I used a rifleman, but ive been thinking about going back to it again. I also used gun fu, but felt like i could live without it. Kind of missing it now lol
---
Dankilsbyyyy, just add me then illl add you back :)
---
The enclave is ok but should be a bit more rewarding considering the process required to become general, but overall very good! And you can already fast travel free to vault 76 btw
---
Anyone who doesn't at least play enough to get a good way through the season without finishing by paying is hardly likley to be wanting to pay+play anyway, especially past the level 4 ammo converter which is the only half decent non+cosmetic reward.
---
Of course someone will pay early but they will be of the 'money &gt;sense' type of player.
---
There’s a Pokémon monster hunter style game maybe look into that
---
Purveyor doesn't drop bloodied faster fire rad barrels though when you know the plan!
---
Personally I wanted to earn the plan myself as well so I get where you are coming from.  Saw it for sale several times at a good price but always held off until I could earn it myself.  
---
Finally got it in the most lame ass way too by getting to the event 5 seconds before it completed.  Received the plan for having done absolutely nothing.  Ended up getting it again 2 days later though when I actually took all 3 pylons so that kind of made up for the dumb way I got it first.
---
I'd play this. I really like the idea of stronger faction alignment and 'flavor' perks that go with it.
---
I like the thought you put into this. Well done.
---
Lol ment the perks.... legendary weapon i know lol
---
-Nuclear winter clears all your quests and keeps you from getting the xp from them
---
-major visual bugs with new cosmetics
---
-clipping issue with fireplace door
---
That is a fair argument.
---
But if you ever have spare bullion, you might as well.
---
-close
---
We will need popcorn for that!
---
What are you shooting for 7 damage per hit?
---
Also there are much better weapons than pipe weapons.  Why not use one of them?
---
I’m one of those that inspects every inch of a players camp. Locked doors don’t stop me. Solid walls don’t stop me. I’m just too curious. If you’ve spent some time fixing up your camp, why wouldn’t you want people to see it!?
---
With jiggling and flaunting
---
My bad, thanks for the help :)
---
Go big or go home.
---
They are going to have to shut down vending again for 2 weeks.
---
you can get lucky at vendors though, bought the plan for 7500 caps at a player vendor.
---
Hardly PTW ehen there's nothing in the rewards that will gain you any sizable and lasting advantage in battle. It's mostly cosmetics together with small boosts to atoms, scrip and gold thrown in.
---
Gave up on power armor builds. Especially when non power armor builds match or exceeds in many areas.  Carry capacity, damage reduction, maintenance and weapon selection. (unarmed) Legendary armor basically makes PA inferior. Even the introduction of stealth suit with a armored backpack makes SBQ nuke zones viable.
---
Yeah the normal minigun chews through ammo faster than my fat ass chews through a burger, my arse puckers at the thought of all that 2mm. Ah well, at least it's easy to make.
---
Lol. Might be storing my vending machine for a few days until I see the coast is clear.
---
It's players with magic-effect guns getting their last fun in before they're patched tomorrow. Not cheaters, just exploiters.
---
The target switching is what I miss if I don't have it, the bonus damage is just gravy.
---
Yeah if others were seeing them then I'd lean to personal lockout like you said. but this is a public event and wasnt just me that it was happening too.  TBH Im seriously not likely going to renew my sub for 76 if they dont start fixing things.  I mean they sell atom shop items that dont even work.... Stanley, Water Wheel just for examples...  then so many camp items that are bugged.  Even that brand new staircase is buggy.Half step too high and half step to far away from the top floor (ie. there a half a step gap and you jump up when walking over that last step.)  Im seriously getting disappointed in these people.   Its like they have zero clue what quality control/quality assurance is.
---
I feel like enclave should be put in neutral, cause as of now they aren’t objectively evil. I feel like the next fallout should show a better side of the enclave, could be an interesting story topic and I think the armor could be cool
---
This is sick, but I think everyone would pick the stash increase. I love the idea otherwise though. Maybe if they all got a stash increase and instead by joining foundation you received more junk from scrapping items or something along those lines. Dope though.
---
Use no perks that help and you need mutant slayer bashing damage handmade and you’re set for life
---
Pipe weapons are easy to repair and benefit from I think the pipe weapon perk and gunsmith perk.
---
250DR resets your character to level 1.
---
That’s because they only fix “unintended” features that benefit the player.
---
I literally just made the same post this morning and got downvoted into oblivion everyone is super butthurt about losing the weekly and daily atoms I guess
---
Unofficial fallout 76 patch PLEASEEE
---
Where did the treasure hunter and insurgent outfits come from? I’ve never seen one in the world only in player vending machines
---
No I haven't actually. Glitching doesnt make the game fun. You're exploiting a glitch for your own gain which should result in a ban, although I doubt Bethesda are hard enough to do that (unfortunately). You can't just assume that everyone here is a duper, because they're not and most people that deal with duped weapons are just people that have recieved them from other unaware people.
---
I made a post about this and got shit on! I want to use pipe weapons just for a role playing purpose but for some reason they don’t want us too! It makes no sense to me
---
Have they added Mods to the Underarmor yet?
---
Use this map.
---

Assuming you don’t get any xp or earn any levels by playing the game over the next 10 weeks, yes... but don’t you plan to play the game? I honestly cannot imagine anyone dropping $120 to skip it all.
---
Temporary events loot pool.
---
Certain legendary effects, when present on a shotgun or a weapon with an effective fire rate of around 200 or more, could cause the weapon to deal obscene amounts of damage, making it possible for a single person to melt even endgame bosses like the imposter sheepsquatch or the scorchbeast queen.
---
If it helps I named all my armour pieces AAA so they stay at the top and are easier to find in my inventory should this happen to me (which it has) :-)
---
Yeah, but if you can easily switch without losing rep in another or something, it's an artificial barrier.
---
Where did the 75% player vending number come from? I get 90% from my vending machines.
---
Yeah I might consider bringing that back lol probably going to drop the concentrated fire 3 to 1 also. Thank you for your help!
---
Oh okay so I better hang on to the one I have. The treasure hunter outfit is my favorite
---
Before worrying about banning anybody fix the game so people are less inclined to exploit the living shit out of it and maybe add some good repeatable endgame content that isn’t just an inane time gated mobile-like grind nobody likes but we do it anyway because we have nothing better to do.
---
I agree with you on all these aspects, which is why I am suggesting that power armor needs either a buff, rework, or at least the addition of increased carrying capacity that exceeds that of deep pocketed armor and allow the backpack to be included in stats while wearing. Wouldn’t you say that in previous installments that power armor was something that would change the game drastically?
---
I will also build you power armor if you meet the minimum level requirements (min level 15)
---
I guess thats the main issue tho right...we are not loseing them...didnt they say the challenges are still going to be there...they just lessoned the amount you get because your now going to be getting more from the new SCORE system i thought it was going to offset what we are "loseing" idk....Im excited...get more stuff for playing the game more. I look at it as they are giving free in game items and currencies just for doing the things we already do day in day out...anyway i am excited...
---
Dang it lol. But that means that you should be closer to getting a good roll!
---
The game isnt all that broken in actuality. There will inevitably be glitches anyway. But seriously, you can't just attempt to justify using a glitch because the game is broken (which it isnt). If you have nothing else to do, instead of exploiting glitches and being a dumbass in general, go play another game instead of shitting on fallout 76 lmao. Bethesda added new content and I know it doesnt last long if you're more than a casual player but seriously, go play something like RDR2 that has a 60+hour storyline and tons more to do outside of the main story.
---
Are you going to address the obnoxious amount of hackers in NW?  Look at this clown below the ground killing people:
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/jXSlDnb](https://imgur.com/a/jXSlDnb)
---
One, they are low tier weapons for early game.  But, two, they benefit from both rifle and pistol perks if you put a stock on them. So if you spec into them, they can get decent damage at the cost of more perk points.
---
No ones going to read that.
---
had the same thing happen to me.
---
was like wtf where is the sheepscatch? looked all over the base of the tower then finally climbed up and was mildly surprised to find it inside the top of the tower.
---
I think it will work almost perfectly.
---
Until a couple of weeks later when a very p'ed off PC Glitching community will produce their most complex and awkward duping and/or God mode yet just to prove they can even if it kills them.
---
And all through this the console users barely blink. 😉
---
Well we can dream...
---
RIP daily and weekly atom challenges, you will be missed.
---
I believe I read a post that the magic weapons are fixed on the test server so that may be going live tomorrow.
---
Adrenal reaction serum scaly skin all unyielding and bolstering secret service full nerd rage full serendipity and full bloody mess boom I one shot scorch beasts with my bloodied faster fire rate gauss shotgun
---
Hey could I shoot you a PM for a marine helmet and insurgent outfit?
---
"Or maybe it’ll even be a more social Challenge like using photomode while you’re partied up." Sucks for us solo players...
---
My Bloodied SS Deathclaw Gauntlet puts out some insane damage.
---
Hopefully just another annoying sound like the frog, or not
---
Any reason you don't switch to a better pistol then? You know, one that looks better and does more damage.
---
And please don't give us that crap about needing it for RP, you don't need damage when you RP.
---
Yeah I saw that. Hope it’s correct. I’m using one now but would love to go back to something less OP
---
&gt; 'Having to think about feeding isn't the problem, **it's having to do it so damn often.** "
---
Yes, ^ This is the major problem I have with feeding and drinking basic food and water in Fallout.
---
XD forgot about that one
---
Someone literally said game breaking
---
For sure haha. They will occasionally do temporary events that have RNG boxes (not for real money though) and they have a chance to drop plans that can only be acquired via these events. From what I understand, a certain set of events will have this same loot pool. So far we've only done one event that has the loot pool (mole miner hunt). The plans were super rare. If I remember they were the following.
---
Radstag Knife, Croc Explorer Backpack, Treasure Hunter Outfit/Hat, Insurgent Outfit/Hat, Circus Trailer CAMP item, Sitting Gorilla CAMP item, Standing Gorilla CAMP item, Marine Armor Helmet. 
---
You could craft the RNG boxes and your odds would go up to about a 1-2.8% chance to get (depending on the item). If you tried to loot it up through the RNG boxes dropped by enemies, the highest % drop rate was a .7%. 
---
I got lucky and got about half the items while playing in the first event. Then through trading and vendor shopping I acquired the others. Only ones I'm missing are the Insurgent hat and standing gorilla. But I give everything out for free cause screw the economy :D.
---
Same.
---
I just can't help but make the argument that we shouldn't have to depend so heavily on workarounds for so many elements of the game. It's a live game with test servers and the intrinsic promise/expectancy that improvements will/should be made over time are the standard in an online-only game like this. They should be doing better by now.
---
that's just the truth about bloodied builds. everyone likes to complain about how "op" they are but without sneak or PA, you're defenseless.
---
bolstering and barbarian are essentially useless considering you're already sitting at around 400 damage resistance. focus on damage reduction instead, like dodgy and ricochet. sentinel or cavalier too, obviously.
---
you're probably already aware of this but silenced shotguns can work almost as well as a sneak commando build.
---
Wait you won’t be able to get atoms from challenges anymore?
---
Fallout 4 was where it started. Gave you PA early in game. Made it feel unrewarding. One solution is to add legendary buffs to PA parts. But then it will make enemies a non factor. OP. Need a balancing in gameplay.
---
Sure! And did you ever play Gw2? I used to know someone with a similar name to yours haha.
---
No problem mate
---
Good lord no I fast travel everywhere, I ain't walking if I can help it.
---
I would always just fast travel to the nearest location and run over.
---
Can someone explain “magic” weapons? I’ve seen that term a few times but I must have missed the boat on what it is
---
MOTHMAN, MOTHMAN, MOTHMAN!
---
I despise that crappy looking mesh floor only stair piece. Why on earth aren't all the potential floor tiles mapped on that piece?! It's so half-assed.
---
I'd say drop egghead as you don't need it, you're armor will buff int pleny and drop scaly skin as you need ap more than extra dr. This should let you drop class freak and put four leaf clover in.
---
I'd definitely like to see items like this added
---
1. I've had this one happen more often than I care to admit. It also resulted in being kicked off the server.
---
2. Have barely played NW. 
---
3. No issue.
---
4. ??
---
5. N/A
---
6. ?? Like don't degrade, 3 start drop for whatever character I want and can use a level 50 weapon just starting out? I WISH.
---
7. I don't group often.
---
8. IDK.
---
9. N/A
---
Try fast traveling to Dyer Chem at night time, they only spawn at night.
---
If you turn from the fast travel point you can look down into the water where the 2 gulpers are, and you'll clearly see if there are any spawned - they're bright yellow, not like the usual orangey glow you see down there.
---
If there aren't any, a few server hops will yield some, I've been farming then recently and they definately spawn on ps4!
---
I remember before wastelanders there was an update where your power armor would disappear - since then i've decided to wait before jumping into the update.
---
Also yes- i know there were multiple instances of power armor disappearing after a patch.
---
Aight, lemme just remember to open my perks, unequip Action Boy, and equip Light Footed, go into sneak, and very carefully approach the vendor while hoping that the perk actually functions correctly in this very buggy game xD
---
I used to use them to expend 38 ammo but the ones i was using seemed to work just fine for trash targets.
---
Whats the matter with garage doors?
---
Either way still better than just dropping the useless ammo on the floor so much that most of the visitors don't even bother to pick it up. Wish I could at least sell it for the time being.
---
You certainly run a melee build, i figure haha
---
Pipe weapons are literally handmade weapons pieced together.  They’re not meant to be pretty.  One of the trade-offs for their lower damage is their low crafting and repair costs.  That said, as another player pointed out, they can benefit from both rifle and pistol perks if built accordingly.
---
They are an entry-level weapon; rarely are they suitable for end-game purposes beyond roleplay.
---
I will end up annoying people by joining a party for a few seconds just for the challenge then leaving but what can you do!
---
Only if you wanna troll the trolls =)
---
Make sure to get sweetwater special blend it will suppress the alcohol addiction for an hour when u drink it
---
Yeah I'm on 0 billion again lol
---
Because literally everything in this game is capped due to the developers' lack of confidence / ability to make the game fun, so they resort to having daily caps and maximum ceilings on everything in a lame attempt to have player retention.
---
Camp budget is specifically to control rendering load on the system, since CAMPs are dynamic objects and not pre-baked like most of the rest of the world. If it renders a model, it costs budget; it's as simple as that.
---
I got mine. Literally took 11 minutes to complete
---
Good to know they spawn at night thanks
---
You know which ones they are, Harry.
---
Weapons with a fast rate of fire that have certain legendary effects end up bugging out the game and do way more damage than it shows in the stats screen. The effects to look for are instigating, junkies, 50% limb damage, 33% vats, or 40% bashing. If your weapon has any one of these, and it’s a certain type (gauss minigun, gauss shotgun, etc), itll do insane amounts of damage especially in vats
---
Nothing’s stopping you from using one for roleplaying purposes besides your desire to do more damage.
---
While very immersive breaking, I do like the slightly off the ground levitating T-pose Epic Scorched. I also like when high level enemies are frozen and I'm free to snipe up close in their domes without retaliation. It helps a solo player earn more XP easier.
---
I'm hoping that i can finally discover Bog town...I've tried after every patch so far!!!
---
Oh yeah and the ammo converter
---
I'm a junkies build ..I'm interested in ur chem use
---
So I don't think they need to go *that* far, but good PvP needs careful thought put into it's balancing. Unfortunately, Bethesda doesn't seem to have enough awareness of their own systems to even begin any sort of decent balancing pass.
---
But power armor wasn’t meant to be a game balancing thing. I mean in New Vegas and in 3 you had to wait and earn that sweet sweet power armor. I grant you 4 ruined that experience and was more of a “hey look at my collection of 50 power armor sets.” But power armor should be stronger than non-PA but what should happen is to help balance and add some realism, make it slow, make the run slower, it’s help make it realistic and possibly even help to balance combat for PvP.
---
That must be what happened.   I just happened to be there when he hit the button.    What sucks is that i had been looting that area for an hour (ok..maybe less) and had quite a good amount of screws to take back to Camp...but he killed me, took everything.    Which is fine, i get it.   Lesson learned.   But for a level 200 player....i wasn't any match for him and he knew it.   I'm sure i didn't have anything he needed.   He didn't set up any excavators...didn't even bother to defend his workshop.   Just robbed me and left.   
---
Oh well.   This hardly ever happens in this game.   Most everyone is really cool and it's one of the main reasons i love this game.
---
Nah fam, Mothman is the way
---
Cut the budget bullshit. The only people that ever had this problem were the ones with maxed out budgets. If anyone else put shit in the fridge the bar wouldn't budge an inch. It was a bug and it's already been fixed on the pts and documented for patch 20.
---
Fine. Let’s totally ignore the fact people can *still* take stuff out of your stash (lost my BE assault rifle to yet another glitch, I don’t even know which one and no I didn’t do the CAMP budget glitch, that one doesn’t interest me) let’s totally ignore the constant server crashes, let’s ignore the fast travel bugs where it either doesn’t happen or you turn up somewhere totally different, let’s ignore that my guns won’t fire a full clip before reloading (particularly noticeable with weapons that use fusion/plasma cores), let’s just ignore how VATS either doesn’t even target something right in front of me or how I can consistently miss 27 rounds with a BE laser rifle despite a 95% hit chance, let’s ignore how half my perks don’t work, let’s ignore the fact that I can crouch, invisible, with 38 agility, not moving, not firing, Sneak 3, Escape Artist, in the dark, with 70lbs on my person, yet I can be spotted by a tweaked out drug addict from 100 yards, then they can shoot me in the head. I’m not even going into all the bullshit myself and many others suffer with on a daily basis.
---
But eventually you won’t be, especially with the season rewarding some. And don’t forget that the under armor is getting a lining soon, with + 4 to str and end, and + 2 per.
---
dunno how many trap houses you snuck into homie, but more often than not, you still die. albeit with a slightly longer delay. I assume it's a bug to do with the game not being able to tell it's a player's boards.
---
Maybe hold T instead of E on PC  
---
(accidental rhymes)
---
Aren’t they supposed to be introducing team matchmaking for regular play? So us solo players can join teams of randos?
---
I think I like this, the only question I have is if the grid of Good-Neutral-Evil takes the criticism of capitalism and who the "good guys" are in account as well as the irony present in lore. 
---
Like, within lore, really who are the good guys and bad guys?
---
great. Now I feel guilty
---
As someone with about 4 copies available I'd have to disagree. People should buy them.
---
Luckily, I never had that happen. But I am angry right now over my secret service power armor. After all the grinding and saving, the first time I wore it, I found out the AP refresh is broken. So, while wearing it, my AP is non existent...
---
What this guy said. Unless it gets extended this is  a pretty common time.
---
I've seen houses that use the Mothman Smoke machine to hide a wall of boards, those ones are funny because it's clearly just a troll. But to hide in stealth while waiting for people to use your vendor so you can kill them is pretty scummy imho.
---
Buying ranks comes available after 2 weeks at least, so we wont see max rank ppl at first day...
---
sometimes i walk into camps and turn off all the lights
---
Thanks for the info I’m still fairly new. So I’m assuming it was the treasure hunter event in the ash heap with those mole miner boxes, I got a couple of those boxes but it had a bunch of garbage in it lol
---
Hopefully forced social interaction eugghhhh ;)
---
I'm focusing on my main character a Shotgun/Sniper. I just want good gear. This one armor piece does allow me to go invisible which I LOVE. I'm still using it and a modded 2 Star Anti-armor Marksman Rifle with a supressor. Char is level 38 and would love something current.    
---
Got the ability to mod the Lining of some outfits but unable to get the mats yet.    
---
I'm not big on skins unless it fits that char and I'm not big on making this huge awesome, mega CAMP.    
---
I really need some magic ammo box that weighs nothing and has an unlimited amount of all kinds of ammo preferably .308 and Shotgun shells for this char.
---
If its on display it'll cost rendering time and data load for server transfers as every players camp design will be different. In comparison items in the stash don't require graphics, or at least will be locally rendered as everyone will have the same exact item, and will be stackable as they are simply a name+number.
---
Technically yes. There's one berry bush next to forward station delta lol.
---
600 caps is fucking cheap!!!
---
Thats not a bad idea! If only there was a way to drop specific mutations. 😅 lol
---
IMO, for 2hd the All Rise. I don't have a melee char but when that char had enemies get too close it would 1-3 shot almost every high level enemy around 75 give or take.
---
Yes, I run all of those. Kicking out the damage is not my problem, it's being able to tank better while in Nerd Rage territory.
---
The abomination?
---
That's a good point and I like the sound of that, my current underarmour gives a 2 to strength and 3 to end I think
---
I like the look of the T-65, but man, that regular SS armour looks way too bulky for my tastes.
---
Not that I'm trying to be a party pooper, of course. Massive respect for going through that grind. I myself only had the energy to grab the plasma caster and its mods.
---
Dumb question but can you explain what you mean by tank
---
Exit PA is bound to long-press of Interact on PC too. It's just Bethesda's lousy UI design in general. There's really no excuse for hard-coded keybinds in modern gaming.
---
It's ironic that their sister company ZOS has remappable bindings for damn near *everything* in ESO. Even stuff that shares keys by default can be independently bound, if you want.
---
Take out gunsmith (which you might want leveled to 5 for crafting purposes) and get nerd rage.
---
I love gun fu for vats, it's relaxing...when vats work... 😂
---
I run bloodied heavy guns, so no sneaking for me! As mentioned nerd rage, serendipity, blocker are great. I'm running 4 uny 1 bol with 3 sentinel pieces and scaly skin, adrenal reaction, healing factor, marsupial and speed demon and I basically have to kite tougher enemies. Also I think I have 1 tank of the perk that auto stims you at 20% health and I try to keep my health around 30% so I have some breathing space. Mirelutk Kings and groups of gutsies will kill you so fast! Also the stuns from the yogi bears are deadly! Once I got the hang of it I rarely die now...
---
got it 👍🏻 still sucks tho :p ty for the answer fellas
---
Not all these effect everyone, but they are all annoyances. Have to have NW icons to notice #2. 3 happens to me almost every time I use a crafting station. 4 is related to the atomic shop water wheel. It used to spin, now it doesn’t. 5 is about the red rocket garage door not being able to be removed or placed currently. 6 magic weapons are certain legendaries with certain effects that do bugged damage. People are able to kill the SBQ in seconds with those weapons. 7 effects area chat (I think), so you can’t hear what those around you say unless you adjust your audio. Every. Single. Time. The smiley thing hasn’t happened to me but I’ve seen tons of posts to know it’s a thing. And the American flag thing is trivial and not abused, but it can lead to abuse and I’ve been trying to let bethesda know for a year now.
---
Funny how all of this stuff only affects you and a minority of the FO76 players. I've only encountered one glitch which was when some oxygen canisters were floating, and that was about 2 months ago now and nothing ever since. Honestly, if this is such a big problem then just simply stop playing the game. And for the record, you exploiting any glitches makes you as bad as the people who took stuff from your stash. I'm honestly done with this conversation but seriously. Play a new game if you don't like it. Don't continuously shit on the game and ruin the experience for others just because you want revenge on a hacker or whatever they are because you wont get it. Have a good night sir.
---
I'm not giving it away either.    
---
I have tons of ammo types on my main who only uses .308, Shotgun, and the .44 for the Voice of Set and taking out robots easier.
---
Just you wait until the first griever finds out that beth forgot to disable camp building/scrapping for teamsters.
---
Explosives expert? 5 points in Int.
---
Uhh I don't think there would be any that help with the explosive bullets perk, you know Bethesda removed that perk off of energy weapons because energy weapons don't fire bullets right?
---
Oof. Yeah it's a bit of a bugger if you already have them. Scaly is the only real problem one as even with unyielding you really notice the ap debuff without class freak and four leaf is really  a far more useful perk for vats builds. You can crit off crits with it.
---
How do I put things on shelves and in display cases? It doesn't seem to give me any options
---
Everybody is waiting on the S.C.O.R.E rewards but I'm most looking forward to how much more social Appalachia is going to be with public teams being added. It'll be great being able to start a team whenever. Also more xp which means faster levelling. I'm starting a CHR toon to take advantage of this.
---
Do you recommend anything for those extra two points in intelligence if I have it at 5? Thank you!
---
My ingame OCD wouldn't ever allow me to leave somebodys camp any different to how I found it lol.
---
Are there any additional quests coming with the new patch? Or events/dailies? I haven’t read anything about it in any patch notes but I’m sure somebody here knows, I am lookin for more of that sweet sweet content
---
The red rocket garage doors were bugged with wastelanders, so if you’re using one you can’t remove it. And you can’t place them because bethesda mixed those up with the ones for the unreleased prefab red rocket station garage door.
---
Oh, that's neat
---
They did a bad job, it still adds to the damage numbers even though damage in pipboy stays the same.
---
Stealing from other people is a hell of a lot worse than making fireworks, I couldn’t care less what you say. And it’s not a minority either. You might be lucky and you could be telling the truth or you could be completely blinded by your love for the Fallout franchise. Either way its not even close to your rose tinted paradise for everyone else.
---
haha...put a bell on it...streamers, finally have a purpose for all those notes by attaching them so they make the "bbbbbbb..." sound.
---
You may have to wait a day or two.  If they don't show up by then, open a support ticket ASAP.
---
Very excited for the step forward, scared what the two steps back will be
---
Wow, they are getting patched, I must have missed that, so it is a swan song and I'm just unfortunate to have started running silos this week, maybe not so bad then.
---
&gt;Not cheaters, just exploiters.
---
I personally see a fine line between these, as they are stealing from other players who are *actual people* trying to play a game they paid for.
---
They know then what they are doing and making hay while the sun shines but choose to be blind to how it affects others. I hope these are kids or hormonal teens, but also hope don't carry this behavior into adulthood.
---
Got tired of Beckett and random npc vendors leaving my shit open. Now all of my doorways have curtains rather than doors.
---
I wear the Treasure hunter outfit over it the armour looks way too weird lol 
---
That's fair lol it's been since Wastelanders dropped
---
I also got the Turbo-fert and the ammo gen as well so yeah big grind
---
The only time it really matters is during the SBQ.  Its not like outside of that the magic weapons are ruining the game for other players.
---
Well, I think it's possible to VATS them out of the air if you're lucky.  They probably think of that as an easier (and more Fallout-y) solution.
---
There's a new atom shop item for the camp every week it seems, but not once has Bethesda added anything from a architecture standpoint. Half walls, half foundation, half-vertical walls, etc.
---
Also stairs that snap to the sides of foundation. What blows my mind is that a lot of what they add to the atom shop is pulled from the game world, you can literally see the same assets re-used. So i don't think it'd be that difficult to just give us more stair options.
---
I have a Free States Camp sign outside, with letters covering States Camp with ammo here. I deposit a bag of ammo I don't use there as I have the ammo machine making .45. I have enough ammo, so it'll make a little difference to me, but very little.
---
Why do people treat shit like this as if it's something Bethesda invented just to fuck with people? Caps like this in any game, and a lot of games have these caps, exist to deter hoarding that could be used to buy out shops of later additions. If when they add  new factions like the upcoming possibility of the BoS they could likely continue using bullion as a currency out of convenience and if you could hoard unlimited bullion you could buy out the entire shop as soon as you unlocked access to each rank instead of it taking months.
---
As someone who just redesigned their young build around being a white trash mad scientist...the inability to effectively use pipe guns on anything bigger than a whisper has already made me make peace with the fact I’ll never really down a SBQ without getting carried by people that understand the depth of the games mechanics better than I do.
---
True. Or with the imposter sheepsquatch, or project paradise boss, or wendigo colossus. Also shouldn’t use them when others are trying to tag legendaries. But outside of that, I don’t really care if they stay or go
---
No, you can't blame players for wanting to be as efficient as possible. Sorry, it doesn't work like that.
---
You blame incompetent devs and spaghetti code.
---
Almost definitely player vending will encounter some stash glitch.
---
The ammo converter will glitch so that there's a way to get infinite ammo, for syryngers.
---
Ward still won't have his rep problem fixed.
---
Try the Powered Armor set and the Regen set. You become the Wolverine. Never tired, always healthy.
---
Daily and weekly challenges will be replaced by seasons starting tomorrow's update.
---
Oh I meant like energy weapons can no longer drop with that perk, ones that have it are considered legacy weapons
---
Autocompletion of atom challenges has been fixed, since atom challenges are going away!
---
However, will autocomplete of season challenges take its place?
---
I'm ready to finally be able to get my SS jetpack. But I'll be bored again after jumping with it 9 times and realize there's still no challenge/reason to play the game.
---
That's correct. It's only for the faction armors and weapons (i.e. Gauss pistol, solar armor, secret service, etc. ) you can get legendary modules from the proveyor at the Rusty Pic for like 50 scrip. When you craft one of those items it rolls random legendary perks for said item.
---
So it’s like a battle pass? Do you have to pay for it
---
that's a deal, I paid 18000 for the circus cage and thought it was an OK trade
---
I prefer solo play as well.    
---
I know one friend who likes Fallout a lot like we do but has no interest in an online game in the series. I have yet to get the Backpack and any mods in the Tadpole questline b/c of the group requirements.
---
You sound like the type of person to call stealth, bloodied, and junky builds cheaters for one-shotting legendaries during events.
---
The positions that the robots spawn from are always the same. This makes sneaking / killing them way easier, and not to forget that there is way less robots if you're doing the silo solo. 
---
The last room is even easier than the other rooms because you can just wait for the robots to funnel in and attack the chiefs; then you just one /two shot them (with a sneak build in this case).
---
In regards of time taken up, then yes, it is longer. But not by much, if you have all the procerdures &amp; robot positions down to a T.
---
yeah seen a few posts recently on the trade sub asking for 25-30k caps for the backpack plan. 
---
I want the circus cage but my camp is maxed already.
---
Other than the foundation stash increase but, I could see this as an interesting way to do a reworked survival mode with the open PvP brought back giving a chance for those of the raider faction to attack others and have the responders come to the rescue could definitely have some potential for a more engaging PvP experience.
---
You can't use them in regular weapons it's just not a thing you can do if you want a legendary shotgun rank up with settlers buy the gauss shotgun plan and make a gauss shotgun that's the on!y way you'll get to use them on a shotgun
---
This guy def has the right idea.used a bloodied pipe gun added a stock and rifleman perks the thing definitely melted
---
Why wait for tomorrow?
---
Hey!!!! Why are the servers down!!!
---
So what you are saying is... #MoleMinorsLivesMatter
---
They're supposed to look like crap.    
---
They're finangled together from whatever parts could resemble what's needed for a gun.    
---
I'm sure making a char that only uses such weapons, wears raider or similar type armor, and all would make for a very interesting time.
---
Two weeks? Those are rookie numbers. We gotta punk it up to four!
---
What if they don't have a private? Are you gonna tell them to just not drop nukes because you or others don't have good enough gear to do enough damage in time to get loot? Why should people bend to you? If someone drops their nuke they can kill the queen quick or slow as they want (or can). Hence why I keep saying its only a dick move to cheese her when its someone elses nuke.
---
Try putting a frog in a display case. Just a frog. 
---
I think you’ll enjoy it, and it’d fit in here nicely.
---
Since I dont have voice that will be fun without text chat then :P
---
Shut up and take my thumbs up
---
heavy gunner perk’s “non explosive” doesn’t apply to heavies with an explosive effect such as gat plasma or laser, just missile launchers, fatmans, etc
---
It will be like a battle pass, each season will last 10 weeks, and you must rank up to unlock rewards, suits, skins, CAMP furniture, best of all it will be free
---
I'm on PC and launch about 4-5 nukes a day, including other peoples nukes I've seen the queen destroyed in 3 seconds just once (still got loot luckily) and her destroyed in 30 seconds probably 5 times tops. I ran a bloodied automatic railway shot from stealth for a long time, I'd recommend getting one or a junkies/furious. With sneak attack you'll do 200-250 damage a shot when she's in the air, one clip even with bugged vats and you've got your loot. You'll spend a bit vendor hopping to get one and then buying the receiver but you'll have almost 100% success in the event.
---
Also please knock before entering the crapper..
---
I'd spoiler tag the ending, I know the game has been out a bit now but there are most likely people who have not completed the quest that will now due to the above poster.
---
Bro I did not even think of that, yikes.
---
They are also fighting against capitalism that harms nature but they did attack the overseer so.. **PURGE THEM ALL**
---
I know I always appreciate it when someone does this!
---
Aw man. I have an apparently magic shotgun that makes me god in VATS. :-(
---
I just didn’t want to believe it
---
Every person who dons an unstopables costume tends to either be grossly misguided or corrupted by their sense of superiority.
---
To be able to take a good amount of damage
---
Then don’t be a bloodied build lol ur supposed to kill it before it hits u man
---
adventure mode pvp i think is never going to be viable without major changes  - many of which would probably make the base game better/more challenging anyway.  I'd personally like to see some faction based pvp, even if it were limited to event participation, but whats there is just not enjoyable.
---
I think like nuke winter is about as good as its going to get, and maybe any other modes that are ever introduced.
---
If we need atoms to rank, then how will we have any to actually purchase stuff in the shop?  I mean, are seasons supposed to replace that content entirely?  Seems like people will come up way short - especially if you’re already a high level and grinding a level a day minimum will be required to stay on top of things
---
The difficulty of the silo doesn't matter. Its the fact that the person used THEIR TIME (usually 15minutes as a norm) to launch a nuke. If they want to murder it instantly then its on them. They sunk the time to launch the nuke and kill her.
---
Edit: and the keycard
---
I've never built defenses for the purposes of killing anything, just a waste of budget. Maybe in the future theyll let us do camp based horde events or something that might actually need something like this but probably not.
---
Should run the game fine. 
---
Try this: go to documents/my games/Fallout 76 and open the file Fallout76Prefs.ini with notepad (maybe make a backup first). Look for the line with 'iPresentInterval=1' and change it to 'iPresentInterval=0', this unlocks fps. 
---
IF you experience movement problems indoors (usually in PA), limit the max framerate for FO76 via nvidia control panel to a little bit under your actual monitor frequency.
---
Have seen a Settler or two let out a yell and then fall over dead at Foundation. It's like they had a heart attack or something. The Settlers just let them lay there...fixing signs and complaining about Sunny's prices.   Nobody has the guts to move/bury their dead.
---
Personally speaking, I'm indifferent to how I earn atoms. I tend not to care much for most of the Atomic Shop items, so I've never really gone out of my way to earn atoms in the first place. Now, though, knowing that challenges can eventually reward me with items and skins, I'll be much more inclined to complete dailies. The atoms will just be a bonus.
---
Give it a try in Vats. I’ve had one for a few weeks too but used a bloodied 1* instead cause the damage looked way higher. Then I tried the quad bashing one and it’s insane how much more powerful it is
---
Wait are you saying heavy gunner doesn't work if a heavy has an explosive effect.
---
Ah yes that's right. I thought you meant about the demo expert perk no longer working on legacy weapons. It's not supposed to but it does.
---
May want to wait until the patch tomorrow before making any decisions. It sounds as if some weapon effects may be adjusted.
---
When an enemy spawns in the floor and I cant finish an event
---
Spelling
---
There's a lot more then just three tho?
---
Huh I had no idea they tried to disable it I thought they just stopped making more lol
---
There's not a lot of options as you noticed, I use rank 2 Demolition Expert, but I have an explosive weapon.
---
Pay for in game advantages, and penalise those that don't pay?
---
no i’m saying it does work, it doesn’t work for missile launchers
---
 Thanks.  I'm on Xbox
---
Tesla rifle bug where it prevents you from doing damage with anything but melee!
---
No problem totally got confused with the way it was worded
---
What do you mean how?
---
Cash money. 
---
It's pretty straightforward
---
The idea was to do both. They patched demo expert shortly after they removed explosive energy weapons from the loot tables. As I say, badly.
---
Mine is the one (hundred) where I shave my head to keep from ripping my hair out.😁
---
No need to sorry!  I think it's cool that people find somethings new in the game !
---
Riding Shotgun is a guaranteed legendary
---
Fast travel bug. Hands down.
---
Most likely so that once the next chunk of "new stuff" comes out that requires gold bullion to buy, you won't be able to get all of it on Day 1.
---
To shit on your floor
---
Didn’t know about this bug but you just reminded me of another. Gauss shotgun has a bug too where after shooting it a few times, it locks up, not letting you run, use stimpacks, or change weapons until you holster the weapon
---
It’s like an actual perk. Maybe stats could improve or get lower with choices? Maybe at most double so it isn’t too OP
---
Well, that's Bethesda quality for ya, I'm just glad they didn't remove my two shot increased rate of fire gatling laser
---
&gt; It only exists to further atom purchases and it brings gameplay way down.
---
Did the hunger mechanic in FO4's survival mode also only exist to further atom purchases? Because if not your point seems like total bullshit.
---
yeah, wanted to reload in midst of the action and hit E instead of R... 
---
\*animationstarts\*
---
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!! \*adrenaline\*
---
:D
---
read somewhere that its useful to change armor with a hazmat or the stealth suit before jumping into PA. this way you will have radiation protection if you accidentially step out of "your car"...
---
Fast travel bug hands down. It impairs a basic function of the game, is completely inconsistent, and has been around for about a year or so now with no signs it's going to be fixed.
---
Wait, we can suggest things?? 
---
Ik they're in the subreddit &amp; read stuff here
---
Stingwings!
---
Oh, not that type of bug....legendaries not dropping legendary items is annoying but at least you can walk away. Fast Travel bugs however leave you grounded. Hit me badly a few days ago and I tested how many times it took to work with 3 jumps - 10, 13, 15...and then I got bored (and a little angry) and logged off.
---
It seemed like GeForce Experience helped a bunch (even tho it literally didn't change anything bc I'm already playing in their optimal setup) but the lag spikes were gone for a good while, only now having some instable and slow framerate but that was way better to deal with and not that big of a problem
---
until I went to the museum of mothman, where I almost died several times bc the lag was so bad, but this definitely seemed to have helped a bit so far, thanks!
---
Fuzzy Brenda can be met at the front gate of the Camdem park during daylight. Julie cannot be met.
---
They don't even have to add anything for their servers to take a crap. I'm sure that with any new addition there'll be issues. I'd rather deal with some issues for a while and have nee stuff
---
*takes your thumbs
---
"You never have to farm food or drink if you don't want to,
---
you can buy them from other players or run a cannibal rad-sponge build, but everyone is stricken with a ravenous need for bullets and healing items."
---
Your perk maxes out at 15. So your S (strength) can have a ton of cards, but you can only have a multiple of up to 15 points used at one time. 
---
You also cannot have 15 on each perk. So choose wisely.
---
You monster!!
---
All my work benches are outside and I use a keypad door
---
Yes the only one, you can search for mappalachia on Reddit and you can verify it
---
Agreed, and some cake too!
---
No I don't, different scenario entirely.
---
much more efficient to make the ultracite 2mm if you are thinking of getting one, 108 rounds per craft vs 20 something
---
Must be difficult to take a piss at your camp.
---
Its only prevalent when the camps near 100% budget or glitched over. Happened to me with my 800 stimpacks stolen off my body. I just disabled the machines until they patch it.
---
Private servers not letting friends in because it says "not friends with host"
---
The details needs some changes but the idea of various factions is VERY GOOD
---
The junkies effect gives you bonuses based on how many addictions you have, when I had a junkies build you could have up to 5 it may have changed by now
---
I was considering going for the ammo producer, but I'm a plasma man, and I learned it maxes out at about 30 rounds, so it's not really worth it for me. I can craft more than that easily-scavenged junk. I guess it would be nice to have it keep chugging in the background, but it's not worth the grind.
---
 Update: [https://imgur.com/a/kU1ikoJ](https://imgur.com/a/kU1ikoJ)
---
Why would I do that when I already know where it is?
---
If u use vats a lot first if not second imo
---
they're asking for that much but its not worth taht much anymore lol i got one out of a vendor for 15 k and no one wanted to even offer anything for it, that was a loss
---
All xmas presents dont give caps and are 5 pounds each.....wait I dont think I'm playing this game right.
---
Nice! Yeah the scenery doesn’t get appreciated enough. Walking from point A to B instead of fast traveling really let’s you take it all in. My favorite pastime recently has been taking a nice relaxing jetpack flight across the map to see everything from up above. Very peaceful and it’s cool to see where everything is in relation to everything else.
---
You do realize that I'm no Bethesda CM?
---
This is brilliant!!!!!   Why can you think of this, but Bethesda can’t? Or doesn’t want to.  Right now there is no point to being in a Settler or Raider. There needs to be god damn consequences (good &amp; bad) for who you side with!
---
Yeah but trap bases would become more popular spawning you into traps...
---
I use vats for just about everything. So yea. That’s what I was thinking.
---
Other games have more than 1 dev
---
That would be pretty cool ngl
---
I wonder why they don't do it during the off hours.
---
The rubberbanding health bug.
---
Thank you
---
yeah ive seen a few of the circus cages for around 10k the last few days vendor hopping. 
---
one person still had it at 25k.
---
Thanks for the advice!
---
I realize now I need at least one weapon with greater or faster damage to hit the SBQ. I thought my 1\* bloodied handmade would do the job, contribute a bit to the fight but it is too slow, it is auto but still 🤷‍♂️
---
I have this thing but never used it,

How can i help?

The level 1 radroach at every scorched earth event.
---
Would like to know also.
---
Maybe roll more  SS armor if its your last part since scout armor isnt that good and if u dont use the jetpack the second isnt rly worth it for you
---
 I do this on a regular basis, I am one of the people youre describing. I know where every single turret is, where each robot spawns, and could walk someone through the steps in my sleep. But im also not a machine, meaning the slightest mistake and its over. If you forget a turret and shoot one too many times from the same position, its over. If you dont get far enough away from a legendary bot and serendipity doesnt proc, its over. 
---
A silo run is bare minimum 15-20 minutes. Going faster than that risks breaking stealth, which elongates the process even more. Not to mention the process of getting the keycard as well.
---
Where as a solo queen fight lasts for about a minute after she first lands. 
---
Im nearly level 500 account wide with no exploits, I have all the gear i need for a full blown bloodied vats sneak commando build, and i run a b2525 fixer. It literally doesnt get stronger than the build i run, and im telling you, the silo is still a pain in the ass. At one point i ran a full set of uny/cav heavy armor with a bss deathclaw gauntlet and my strength nesr 40. Listed damage was 1753, it still sucked. It doesnt matter how good you are when a single forgotten bot can end it for you.
---
The only way to make it go faster is with more people so the risk of having to reset a step or dying to a mistake is much lower. With a 4 man crew id bet it could be done in 10 minutes as that would nearly eliminate the mainframe core and vent repair steps.
---
are you chosing under the right category?
---
they 100% do not and i currently have a deathclaw i tamed at max budget
---
Lucky
---
I'm also Xbox bert102176 sometimes my son plays along with me he's 9
---
That's a distinct possibility.
---
I just blew through all my modules trying to get an UNY SS piece and that’s all I got out of it. I do use the jetpack but I think vats is more important here

I use a bloodied ultracite Gatling laser as my backup for my .50 cal and gauss mini, that thing actually shreds
---
It's not the same thing because the issue is that you HAVE hunger and thirst. Doing what you suggest just shifts the burden from food to perks, which honestly is a waste for anything other than roleplaying (maybe unless if you switch them out every time you need to eat, adding another layer of tedium). You still get hungry and thirsty, and therein lies the boring gameplay.
---
No, food and drink disincentives people to idle about and hang out with their bros. its just more chores unless youre going for buffs which we still can get. almost nobody enjoys having to worry about food and drink
---
you are like the kid in school who reminds the teacher to collect homework
---
Yes, I bought the perk three times and it didn't increase a single special point.
---
It was a stupid but fun glitch, but I miss the camera emote launch glitch, I'd love for that to make a return 😂
---
strange, relog is your best option to fix that, close the entire game and reopen. let us know if worked
---
There are always mole miners in and around Blackwater Mine, even with UF isn’t happening. It’s the most convenient location for quick looting and selling because it’s right next to a train station. If the event isn’t happening and you don’t get enough to burn through your daily caps, just server hop and you’ll be able to do it again.
---
Got some help already but thanks!
---
Ya I can still jump 10 feet high in my power armor lol
---
Off hours?
---
Im also very excited I'm not arguing with you there.
---
Well from what I read is you can still earn atoms from world challenges and character challenges but now instead of atoms the daily's and weekly challenges will reward SCORE only and no atoms. Which if you think about it the only thing they are doing is taking away our choice of what rewards you get.
---
The system now you earn atoms and choose what to skins or camp items you really want, but the new system you'll still end up get about the same amount of stuff your just have no choice on what your getting.  I know why people are mad but honestly I always have more atoms than I need cuz theres never really that much cool stuff in atom store anyway
---
Maybe test a little since its kinda personal preference and stick with the one u like most until u get a better one
---
*You take a sip from your trusty Vault 76 canteen...*
---
STOP. HAMMERTIME.
---
Your best bet is to server hop at Dyer Chemicals until you get a server where they've spawned. Night or day doesn't matter, although they're much easier to see at night due to their glow.
---
Equip Green Thumb before gathering and craft Radshield with the Chemist and Super Duper perks equipped to make the most out of any Strangler Blooms you find.
---
After you finish their quest line they're supposed to give you a daily that gives a guaranteed legendary. It's mostly good for scrip but still. I think the fix for Beckett is coming tomorrow though!
---
The Vats bug
---
Must be the brotherhood one. Also, suggestion - you can get Enclave shielded lining for free in Tanagra town.
---
Nothing it's just spoiled flux
---
The other reason I've disengaged from the food system (and just use a stack dogfood) is the inventory system is so terrible.
---
You can see Outer Worlds tried to improve the consumables system with it's inhaler system where you could throw a bunch of different consumables into the slots and use them on one button, but even that fell into the issue where you'd need a stack of specific items, otherwise you're still juggling stuff when you run out of it.
---
The majority of the time my use of the food system in fo76 is 'i just need to eat something, anything to fill this damn bar', even beyond, as you say, the absurd frequency and amounts of food required to do that, the process itself is a in the ass.
---
The eat-from world function was a good step, but this needs to be expanded to:
---
eat from container.
---
eat what you just cooked.
---
and maybe add eat raw plants too.
---
All those would skip having to use the horrible pipboy inventory system.
---
Fast travel bug. Nothing infuriates me more than opening the map, clicking to travel and nothing happening—over and over and over and over again.
---
...and diseases...
---
Ok thanks
---
Oh thanks I'll see if I can get it and compare stats
---
In a public event that someone else instigated by launching a nuke being efficient should include sharing for maximum community involvement, public events are not PVP group fights.
---
I do also blame the game developers for causing this, but maybe they to hoped for better from the 'community'.
---
But but, you're a mutant!
---
I bought the perk that "decreases the AP points while sprinting" two days ago then again yesterday and it still only giving me the perk.
---
actually a hell of an amazing job with the sheet, I would absolutely love that
---
and when it goes beyond 16 hours - "OMG guys perfection takes time".
---
I’ve noticed a significant different from having the AP refresh so that’s what I’m gonna go with. Now the question is: custom fitted or cushioned on the legs? I already have speed demon so I don’t need sleek
---
You can drink it. After a few nuke zones you'll survive on a diet Inert Flux, Ionized Meat and Glowing Mass for awhile.
---
As far as I know there was plans for adding more stars, but it got scrapped.
---
Drinking. It's the only thing it's good for - it quenches thirst as well as purified water does, but weighs less, at least without weight-reducing perks.
---
These posts seem like fairytales to me. Been playing 2 days and its griefers galore. But good to know there's some do gooders in the wasteland however rare
---
Yeah I just saw a video. I'm fricking blind.
---
Also (industrial) gauntlet for unarmed. I think it's en par with the power fist but probably easier to "farm" as you can craft it with legendary modules.
---
This happens to everyone, pretty sure.
---
I think it's just the game refreshing the spawns, for some technical reason.
---
Edit: Nevermind I was mistaken.
---
I generally don’t ahave a problem with food in game, but actually I do. I start a session, putter around my camp fixing crap, emptying containers, making food, printing ammo, running crap to the nearest station, shredding any stray legendary junk I have left over, play the mole minor game to get another explosive ghoulslayer pipe pistol.(seriously that was today’s) Then shower slam down seemingly random food and drinks for the buffs and head out. Seriously i think over a session I eat more food than the Texans defensive line at thanksgiving. Combined. And even then it’s still a pain in the arse.
---
Drink of the gods! 🍺
---
I use 5.56 mainly that maxes at 200 but yeah for 30? Thats not worth it but it's good to have to sell or trade other ammo types for Plasma, just a thought as well as that with the ammo converter, you could mix and match them both so you can get more free Plasma saves on resources, long term of course 
---
I do use a Gatling plasma but that ammo is cheap to mass produce had like 50, I have the perk dw lol and I'm down to around 20, this is from a good few months, before Fasnacht just for the queens, still after a better one though 
---
I blame games like TLOU or 7 Days where you need to be efficient with your resources or find yourself short later, you know?
---
Most of the time if I drop it in blast zone it’s after queens been killed and I’m deep into blast. Cba to find a free spot when, you guessed it, I don’t need it lol. Memberships are not new to any game, was playing to scape back in 2006.
---
they did say they fixed it actually, i read the patch notes and many you tubers covered it
---
Can't wait to see what glitches pop up
---
Yes, if you are a lazy git, you could conceivably pay-to-win the whole thing.  And it will cost a lot.   As it should, really.
---
But if one isn't going to be playing to get the rewards, why bother paying for the rewards?
---
It weighs less than purified water and gives you a disease protection buff
---
I was trying to give a level 2 player a bunch of supplies yesterday but he kept running away from me lol 😂 i plugged my mic in and was like get over here so I can give you some free shit.
---
It's great as a purified water substitute. I usually farm nuked areas and just get a lot of flux just to help keep my thirst down.
---
I dont think the world challenges are that bad but some i agree are asinine (7600 hrs for 20 atoms really?) But again they give you something to work towards.  I see a mixed bag some people cant keep atoms cuz they think everything is cool I rarely see stuff I like so I have atoms stacked to the roof. But the sink I want so bad. I love making realistic homes and camps so I've been wait for this to finish my kitchen and bathroom
---
The outer worlds inhaler automatically used a similar item from your inventory if you ran out of the one you had in an inhaler slot
---
The other description made it sound more complicated IMO, but if you put a doorway down you can then attach another doorway on the other side of it, double facing doorways. Do this for any double walls you want, then just go into build mode and instead of scrapping hit replace, you can then turn them into regular walls and go nuts with wallpaper. RIP the camp budget though.
---
Ah, someone else had this problem and that's what was said.  Guess you can just add it to the list of "fixed" but not really issues, smh.
---
Nice of him to give it back though, had to know something was up when it was posted for 30 caps, lol.
---
Awhile ago, you could have a 4* legendary. Examples would be having a 3* machete and adding the sacrificial blade to it, then giving it 4*. Of course that can’t happen anymore. If I had to guess, when the game starts slowing down, or they stop adding new content, then maybe they will allow for 4-5* legendaries. Just a guess.
---
If ur on Xbox I could give u some spare stuff
---
Are you ranking up the cards?
---
Yeah, like they're going to see this post, nobody scrolls/searches to see if somethings been asked before...29 times already
---
That and the average person is lugging a lot more than was given to some GIs for DDay.
---
I go for buttressed normally for the extra damage resitance tbh
---
Friends list bugging out when you’re trying to team up with someone.
---
yeah yesterday was the first time as well for me.  then again today.  Wish Bethesda had some kind of public JIRA so we can post official PUBLIC viewable bug reports.  I got at least 10 reports I could file of different bugs.  I just wish they would fix stuff instead of keep pushing new (and even broken content)
---
Honestly? Nothing. Some of the season rewards are fine, the ammo converter appears to be the only actual feature, but there's no new new content, nothing new to explore or do.
---
Not particularly against the season pass ( I never worried about atoms or cosmetics in the first place), but I'm not convinced it's a good thing either and I doubt I'll play the game any more often than normal because of it. Here's looking forward to the actual content updates later in the year.
---
yeah he was lvl 400+ and messaged me first about it thankfully. i’m glad there are still some good people on the game at least
---
Already have buttressed. Cushioned and custom fitted are the secondary mods.
---
The season starts tomorrow 
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/seasons
---
No I didn't rank the cards yet
---
51 is just chilling in the woods a little northwest of Aaronholt homestead.  Not a marked location.  Doesn't really make for a great photo either since they placed a large rock over the vault door because people were glitching through the door to get inside.
---
Random flinch/stagger bug fixit already!
---
Rubberbanding. Jesus christ.
---
God I want that Mr. Pebbles backpack so bad. My luck it'll probably come back exclusively in a bundle full of the Mr. Pebbles stuff I already own.
---
Re-read their comment. Play to win, not pay.
---
If you want to change it up try a Berserkers build..  it's the most fun I've had in the game for a long time.  At 0 damage resistance it is the same base damage output as junkies (50% dmg boost).   With no damage
---
 resistance you have to rely on damage reduction perks/armor,  and stealth is practically a must.  Knowing you can be practically one tapped by some creatures lets you appreciate life I guess.
---
I'm not 100% sure of the mechanics, but it's possible it works like the settlements in FO4.
---
In FO4, the game would decide how many enemies would attack - and how tough those enemies are - based on how elaborate the settlement was.  
---
And the way the game judged how 'elaborate' a settlement is, was based on how much of the settlement budget was used up. Put simply, more budget used = more enemies spawn.
---
For this reason, turrets end up being self-defeating. Because the more turrets you put down, the more budget gets used up, and the more and more enemies the game throws at you.
---
I think it’s a another one of this game’s bugs. lol. I’m on PS4, but I’ve been in a friend’s private server and then get kicked to the main screen with an error message along the lines of you are not friends ya-da, ya-da, ya-da...And then all of the sudden, said friend is no longer on my list...but he could see me. Weird. 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
It’s chad water
---
I might be mistaken but didn't very early on the Scorched receiver add a legendary star? That was before Fixers and such that had innate undocumented legendary effects. So I guess if you had a 3\* Fixer with a scorched modifier it would technically count as a 5\*?
---
Yep a great deal of players often forget this after a while of grinding, myself included. 
---
I wish the game would encourage this type of play.
---
I hope they fix the Mire daily bug where it rewards me a mini nuke instead of a tattered field jacket.
---
Wow.  
---
I still have some gripes with 76 but I'm still ill with BGS for many reasons I won't get into. They are known for the bugs that never get fixed.
---
I mean no one said they were evil. It's just a way to scale them. Enclave and Raiders are less empathetic on average and willing to kill other humans on sight.
---
Coming soon, in the atom shop. For the low price of 1499!
---
With some tweaking this would be awesome you need to make the actually da top. More important than the bonuse make jointing the faction more important than the actual buffs.
---
It is no different then telling people they can get out ammo &amp; healthkit crafting or weapon repairs by just using perks. You still have to do damage and heal, and it is a waste of perks to lessen the tedium associated with it, and may be forcing people into a playstyle they don't even enjoy.
---
[This](https://imgur.com/a/ZZDYm3T) is my adapted from original bloodied heavy setup. I swap and change a lot of stuff in depending what I'm doing, but that's the gyst of it. 
---
I don't have to worry about any enemies really, doing damage-wise, besides when I'm doing encyptid/queen so I don't need to swap damage cards about (the rifleman is for the bloodied explosive lever action I use as an everyday weapon to one shot stuff).
---
The only stuff that really kills me or comes close besides assaultrons  is poison/acid stuff. I've been killed more by cave cricket farming than anything else. Other than that the only time I unexpectedly die is when I have been crafting and forget to reequip serendipity. 
---
I do a lot of kiting enemies, I have the SS jetpack, as well as marsupial, speed demon, grounded, scaly skin, bird bones, adremal reaction and healing factor. My armor is all unyielding BoS combat armor or secret service buttressed with various secondary effects. In an ideal world I'd love to roll some unyielding poison resist/AP regen but that will probably take forever and I'm ok mostly anyway, but it would finish off the build. 
---
Bolstering is kinda a waste, as there are diminishing returns on DR after like 370ish so you're better bulking up your SPECIAL whilst you're low. If I['m in a team I also add strange in numbers and tenderizer or something.
---
It's by no means a standard build but it's the one that has been tailored to my playstyle and needs and works well. Any questions feel free.
---
Well, if you've been doing your Davenport dailies, you should have dozens of pics of the Colonel Kelly Monument and Black Bear Lodge...what more do you need?
---
Seriously though, I would suggest following the Bucket List from the Camera Mission. There were quite a few things on there that are very photo-worthy.
---
It *was* a survival game. I carried corn soup, or if I was lazy, corn and water.
---
If picking up food/water is too much, you should try the paint drying simulator.
---
pfft
---
Any of the audio bugs, but specifically the ones that cause a sound effect to suddenly very loud out of nowhere.
---
Would happily pay that. Any staircase that takes up ONLY one floor tile would be beautiful
---
I appreciate that but I'm ps4. I dont mind being the underdog in the beginning. I've just ran into a few who've gone out of their way to ruin my start. Its all good though, you win some you lose some. Thanks again though
---
Then cushioned i guess since custom fitted just reduces ap cost for sprinting
---
if u use the jetpack a lot
---
Goodbye Atoms.
---
And there will be another dupe glitch
---
Most of the time I just sort by spoilage and eat from the top of the list.
---
Cooked items should last basically forever, particularly the teas that are in sealed jars. If you seal the jar while it's hot it vacuum seals itself is it cools etc. When I say forever I just mean a really long time.
---
There should be a perk for auto eating or auto drinking that automatically feeds you whatever's about to go bad as soon as there's enough room for it on your meter.
---
By making it a perk it's optional for the people who want it, and when you finally run out of food if you haven't been just maintaining your supplies it could be a sudden inconvenience. I consider that sudden inconvenience to be a plus not a minus. because in real survival circumstances it's the things you're not paying attention to that end up getting you.
---
I think things like refrigerators and coolers should sort of work like workshop resource producers, where you have to lock them to keep them private and your defenses can intervene if someone tries to pick the locks.
---
So you could put down a cold storage stash, which would be a regular stash box but if you've got one of them anywhere it's preserving your stored food.
---
But you could also put down containers that aren't part of your stash that other people could use or raid that could pursue your food and stuff.
---
The difference between your stash and those sorts of containers is that those preservative containers aren't part of your stash, aren't secured unless you secure them, but do a much better job of preserving your foods.
---
Try ranking them up (combining cards).  May help.
---
Damn, really? That sucks, I wanted to get all the Vault doors.
---
I just tried logging in and is it just me?????? I don't have time to look at other postings.
---
Check their profile, if you show as a follower and not a friend, it means they unfriended you.
---
Seems to happen with NW bro's, so they can see you in the lobby, and you can't see them.
---
and they recently made it so you can eat and drink without picking it up.. still too much work.. lol
---
I hate that they gimp this game so much..
---
Oh look.. Another carbon copy review. If you can't even make a title that's not a meme than why would I expect anything else you write to be original? What's funny is we're a day away from update number 20, and this is after multiple dlc's and previews of up and coming dlcs yet you and other "reviewers" are still writing your shit like it's an epitaph. The game isn't popular, but it's not dead and shows to sign of dying any time soon. Deal with it.
---
Thanks for the tip, going to try that when I log back on
---
Power armor and bloodied are both sub-optimal even for the best players. Get assassin sentinel armor and run junkies, AA, or vampire.
---
I actually haven't been doing those dailies. I didn't get a camera until bizarrely late into the game. I'd launched a nuke and done at least half of the Wastelanders storyline before I ever found one. It did occur to me that the Bucket List quest could be useful though, so thanks for the tip.
---
Once you find it, I'd suggest server hopping. I've found a few well designed Camps that make note of the fact its Vault 51. I know they're not really landmarks, but some are quite well done.
---
Great work in this post &amp; idea. I'll just speak my mind on how it's a bit hard to label some factions with being good or evil. Still this template is good, it doesn't hurt to keep it simple.
---
Upon loading, you find yourself in the back of a wagon on the way to be executed.
---
I’m not sure. I’ve had the game since the first week but stopped playing until wastelanders after finishing the year one content. Never came across or even knew you could do that. Very interesting though
---
Yeah, they seem to be lowering game standards to the lowest common denominator, not to some kind of a balance.
---
I have moments like that where I get close to a burnout but periodically ill turn around while farming and be greeted by this fantastic view of the surrounding areas, the way watoga is occasionally the only thing visible in the cranberry bog when you look off a cliff is actually kinda neat
---
Why is there a commotion about them only now? Is it because some youtuber made a video on them or something?
---
aren't you with an (-) beside the number? or you looked at the card perk screen already
---
Want More spoilers? Even if Johnny gets past that part, he’ll try to kill you in the vault room and take off with your own share. So I but that bullet between his eyes myself.
---
Taming a rad stag or Yao guay as a mount wold be cool too
---
Yeah I usually don't bother buying things if the camp is closed, and I sometimes buy stuff if the camp is cool, even if it's expensive.
---
I think Cult of the Mothman and Blue Ridge Caravan would be close behind, honestly. The free fast travel network the former gives and the cap increase the latter gives are pretty enticing.
---
I’m sorry. But NOTHING would interest me in PvP. I don’t like it. I never have, and I never will. People tend to be toxic and there’s nothing worse than toxic people. I already tell myself I’m a worthless piece of crap, I don’t need strangers doing it, too.
---
But these are pretty great ideas nonetheless. Great job! 👍
---
I have such one (Zealot) Fixer with Scorched Killer receiver. Its has 5 effects, though only three stars are shown.
---
I would always be Brotherhood I dont care what buffs other factions get. Ad Victorium!!!
---
Do you know if the cushioned mods stack if I put them on both legs?
---
Guys I made this post just to inform people of the price it’ll cost that’s it.
---
lol 'minors'
---
He can still live through speech checks though.
---
BGS said it was still a possible issue if you were over 100% camp budget, and your vending was located close the the spawn point.
---
You're not going to get much sympathy, if the bug was caused by your own actions.
---
The one where you can't respawn after dying or you're just paralyzed if you do manage to respawn
---
You can be up to 1000 over encumbered before you can't move around quickly, so lose weight reduction perks for the fight. Even just a few ranks of heavy gunner will help. Preferably prime it and get power armor with emergency protocols. You can server hop mod spawns till you find the mod since it can be expensive, that should give a fighting chance.
---
1. Sometimes VATS or fast travel will cause a black screen but able to still move and see the hud.
---
2. Menu lag
---
3. Unable to preview items from bot and player vendors
---
4. Enemies spawning underground making it impossible to complete the event
---
5. Sometimes doors say close when they're already closed causing them to quickly open and closed in your face
---
6. Static ghouls unable to be killed
---
7. Melee power attacks don't do any damage half the time
---
8. Character will randomly stagger and take 1 or 2 HP of damage for no reason
---
9. On a rare occasion you can get stuck on a loop doing and emote
---
10. Spawning under some player camps
---
11. Using the Friendly Fire level 3 perk and Shishkebab to heal NPC's during some events sometimes does not work or stops working after a few hits
---
12. Sometimes in VATS with melee even when face to face with an enemy is unresponsive
---
Yeah, but I ain’t letting anyone live that tried stabbing me in the back if I get any say in it.
---
Hey you’re like 10 feet in the air, let me still hit you with melee
---
I agree. As a relatively new player, the *constant* food spoiling &amp; hunger are a pain in the was but for a game otherwise noted as being so lite on even traditional role-playing elements especially when it first started, the fact that it had hunger/thirst built into the base game rather than just in a hardcore mode was surprising and kinda neat. The implementation just wasn't anywhere near as good as it should be.
---
Another thing that would be cool is a water canteen that works similarly to NV so that you don't have  to constantly open up the favorite menu or pipboy. Thst in conjunction with slower thirst/hunger accumulation would be so much nicer while still feeling important to manage and maintain.
---
I think so but it doesnt stack with acrobats if i remember it right
---
Mothman giving free travel all over the map would be insane now that I think about it, if you add the mine with the sleeper, lucky hole mine I think? I forget it’s name. Then you’d have a free fast travel to all areas of the map, you could travel there then fast travel to where you really wanted to go for like no caps.
---
haha.. little kids playing minecraft can handle having to eat.. but its too much for the 76 playerbase..
---
fucking clownshows.. lol
---
I'd be willing to suspect most players killed Johnny, deliberately or not.
---
That is moleist! How dare you!

i understand that but my camp isn’t over budget??

the budget is about 75% of the max so i’m not sure why or how this happened still

As others have suggested, I want a quest where you can bring her a Nuka cola!
---
If you wouldve quit the game world, it would have reset the instance. When Johny shot me over the gold, I simply quit, and choose the proper speech again.
---
I hear you.  Aside from the converter nothing really interests me all that much.  Nothing I see would i even buy from the atom shop with the exception of the clean sink.
---
Running the same events over and over for the last 18 months has gotten pretty boring.
---
Weapon wheel freezing the game
---
Arguments for PA buffs always come back to the stabilized  perk and how good it is. (Rightfully so)
---
I think if the Stabilized and Emergency Protocols bonus is reduced by at least a third, that opens the doors for tank style perks to come in. I personally don’t wear PA for weapon damage, though I know some do. I think with power armor damage output nerfed, you can buff defense and QoL perks like carry weight/rad defense without PA becoming the only option.
---
I agree with everything you've said.
---
Particularly annoying after spending bullion on a grocer's backpack!
---
Edit to add: If I have a cram burger, Tato and nuka cola, I want a free toy to appear in my inventory! 😁
---
I found them there! You’re a rockstar. Thanks again.
---
I played it for like a week when it first released but no I'd never really played it!
---
No, all of them are positive
---
lol toxic?  No.  You made a really shitty joke.  Live with it chump.
---
I was forced to kill him in the beginning multiple times due to story line glitch where if he lives, the other members of party despawn from the vault.
---
It would be insane, and a game changer. Back during the spawn hack I messed around with 5 star weapons and armor, and some really overpowered and interesting combos could be made.
---
Exactly. "Cultist location" is pretty vague, but if we were to take it at face value that would be "every location controlled by cultists", and there's one at most a 4 cap distance from every player frequented location except maybe the Prime Fissure Site.
---
You can always pick up "Where Theres a Will, There's an A"
---
I agree with you there 100%, however for me sadly this isn’t the first game I’ve played that has the “one step forward two steps back” development cycle :-(
---
No problem. Just helping fellow vault dwellers out.
---
Yeah, the food/water system was just very poorly implemented.
---
Compared to survival games like Ark for example, food in this game drains quicker and doesn't last nearly as long.
---
What they should've done, IMO:
---
- Significantly slower drain on food and water (maybe 1/4)
---
- Most cooked food should last a very long time, or not spoil at all
---
- Many recipes, especially ones for good or unique buffs should be a lot more complicated or harder to make
---
I think the reason some don’t return isn’t Bethesda’s choice... for example dion doesn’t allow them to use his songs. Thus why you don’t hear the wanderer anymore
---
A new way to dupe. Who wants 500 lunchboxes?
---
I'd like a 90degree stair, preferably with optional left/right/both/none bannisters, that i can fit in the corner of a small bijoux residence.
---
Reconfigure the weapon into a commando weapon. Then, get a solid legendary effect. My AAE/LVC pipe rifle cleans house and is great for general grinding. 
---
The weapon is great in the hands of a stealth vats commando, but I would advise against using it in pistol or semi auto configuration.
---
CSS seems to be bugged with the Escape Artist perk.
---
Speed Demon for the win
---
I posted this a few times and I think it would be pretty fun. Make the bikes paint-able and travel just a tad faster than a sprint.
---
I can't wait to see "Where's my Red Rocket Garage Prefab??!" posts after update goes live.
---
Great ideas! Personally, I would stay away from 'good/neutral/evil' alignments for the factions. As we've seen from the current Crater/Foundation storylines and NPCs, it's much more gray than that. I, like many others, actually like the Raiders more than the Settlers, despite my desire to play as a 'good guy' on my main character.
---
Lock your door

Radants!!

Ah interesting... I’ll try it out then.

I'm prepared for a lot of things.  People complaining about how much of a grind the season is going to be, out of touch people complaining that all of their daily and weekly atom challenges suddenly disappeared, people complaining that bethesda didn't fix a certain bug they hate, people complaining that Bethesda did fix a certain bug they liked, and as always the guarantee of someone complaining that legendary spawns/drops are messed up or that their hunger/thirst is depleting faster.
---
Gladly! Same name as here, logging in now.
---
Fuck just dropped 50k of the damn useless one's the 44 i think idk it's the one that don't way anything
---
This proposal is intriguing and very well done.
---
My two cents: I would move Crater (Meg's) Raiders to Neutral and slot in the Blood Eagles (or perhaps Cutthroats Reborn) instead for the 3rd Evil faction.
---
IMO, Crater Raiders are not a "traditional" Raider group--and the majority strike me more as opportunistic than evil. They can be friendly and cooperative--esp when properly motivated--anyone that can be reasoned and negotiated with at least has a shot at being Neutral.
---
Second this mate! Events like this, are what’s really complementary with the Fallout experience and their audience imo. It would make it even better. This and perhaps combined with some building stuff :) as extra. Would love to test my house against some hordes 😁
---
It seems to trigger after you hop to a world where your camp can't place?
---
I also moved all of my stash boxes entirely away from my vending, and my vending is on the opposite side of the common spawn points.
---
Came here to say this.  Everytime I see one in a house while exploring I just sigh and think of the possibilities.
---
What flux are you needing?
---
What good is any of that when they can't be dropped or traded?
---
Ahhhh shit!
---
I like the idea and was thinking something similar. My idea was to be able to craft a legendary effect onto an existing piece of armor, using a legendary module, but the effect would be bound to the piece once crafted (you couldn't reroll without crafting or finding an armor piece that didn't have a legendary).
---
I like the idea of making the legendary effects for PA different than the standard armor effects. Some of my ideas follow.
---
**Mirror Shine:** Reflects up to 8% of energy damage (per piece with this effect). Damage reflected is reduced as the armor is damaged (0% at 50% condition or less).
---
**Impenetrable:** 20 DR per piece, and resist armor penetration (-10% AP per piece).
---
**Energy Star:** All cores last 20% longer per armor piece (stacks with power user).
---
**Atlas:** \+20 carry weight per piece.
---
As far as general PA changes/fixes. I agree that all PA should add +50 carry weight by default, as well as give immunity to stagger, and immunity to catching a disease from enemy attacks... and yeah, useful arm mods would be great.
---
Could be sure to the new patch and server stability issues.
---
Later its 150 so...
---
They need to come up with a new way to make them fun though.  I ran Vault 94 a few times and it was just a buggy mess that used all my radaway and ammo.  I know many enjoyed them but they can do better  from a mechanics perspective.  I just don't think timers and switches are a good design choice when almost everyone experiences lag.
---
I do think that they will come back though eventually, especially now with the team function.
---
There not cheaters, just dicks
---
Que?? How do you get agility in the 40’s? My base agility is 10 out of 15 and with my full unyielding armor it’s at still only at 25. 
---
(But yeah at 25 agility I still get noticed often. It seems like some enemies just have absurd amounts of perception.)
---
A cautious maybe? I don’t know if legendary effects are needed, but here is my personal take for some life quality improvements. Feel free to disagree. 
---
1. PA feels like they are about 50 pounds shy of what the mech suit should have for base carry weight. I’d be OK if they upped base carry, then continued to allow calibrated shocks to max out carry weight. Alternatively, leave carry weight alone but liberate PA users from having to rely on passive weight reduction perks because they are built into every suit of armor.
---
2. Disease resistance. Insects and ferals should not be getting me sick in a sealed suit of armor. I’d bolster disease resistance on PA.
---
3. Basic motor skills. I can pick a lock in PA, but I can’t turn a BBQ spit? That ain’t right.
---
I think a few small improvements can help PA stay relevant in the game.
---
I hope they add 4th and 5th stars.. but you have to eat in order for them to register their effects..
---
For a daily???
---
Are you doing enough damage to it? It has a minimum damage requirement to get loot off of her.
---
Solo? If not you must do a minimum amount of damage to get a share of loot, which is becoming harder as more bugged heavy weapons are found.
---
I want to be tactful but this was just not well written, nor informative. 
---
Also you liked all the new creatures in far harbor but don’t like the 15ish new creatures in 76?
---
Atoms are purely for cosmetics
---
The spread on that display frog is impressive.
---
Can't you remap the controller keys to suit your own personal play style?
---
Not a bad idea, but PA would need to be able to have 2-3 mods per piece to really balance out legendary effects compared to non PA armors.
---
Yay, i can bring him back. He gave the best rewards so far. At least for me.
---
I’ve had it travel me to a totally different part of the map before. It’s rare to happen but fast travel can be goofy sometimes.
---
Yeah or maybe some other drawback like they degrade faster like the new cursed weapons will or perhaps they even jam. Guns used to do that in the older fallouts
---
only once a day though
---
If XP gained is significant enough to add a lot to your season leveling, you won’t need to pay $150 to level up when you can place a blueprint to gain 30k XP
---
I’m excited for public group hopefully we’ll be able to grind some treasury notes
---
O u talking about the daily ok and for Locations there are 2 maps and they spawn kinda random Morgantown: Go to the Highschool and flatwoods maybe vault tec agriculture or whatever its called
---
I really like that first suggestion a lot! Much better! Also yeah I think you shouldn’t get any diseases, what is with that? And yeah they should increase basic skill functions as far as interacting with things goes.
---
I just wish the complicated recipes made food that was actually worth it. Stuff that requires mirelurk eggs, royal jelly, or rarer plants like thistle (looking at you tato surprise salad) should give bigger buffs since they're all more work to find.
---
Yeah definitely give it another shot. Wastelanders brought in NPC’s so the world doesn’t feel as lonely. And there’s so much other stuff added that it’s hard to know what all to mention. Best just to get on and try it out.
---
You need a new build, gear, and weapons. If you’re interested enough I will gladly show you my build as well as guide you in the right direction for what gear you need.
---
If on PC do beware that it is full of exploits and cheats, especially Nuclear Winter mode which is a cheat fest. But if you ignore that then it is still fun and you are getting Wastlanders content to run through also. You will not be at a disadvantage, it's not how this game works, unless you are PVP oriented then you need to get the current meta weapons and armor.
---
You may as well try if you already own the game, have fun!
---
I think I read they decided not to put that in this patch
---
id love for them to bring 94 back, sadly it appears it will not return since server stability is the biggest issue they had at the end.  id also love to see them finish 96 and release it, since last i saw it was nearing completion. 
---
at this point my largest hope for a 94 rework is that they take the G.E.C.K. room and turn it into an endless defence mission, with scaling rewards (think old warframe endless missions). then allow the rest of the vault to be "reclaimed" by new npc's who work (special shops) to support the people who protect the geck from going critical.
---
You would not be at a disadvantage. What didn’t you like before when you played?
---
You could put perk cards in the spokes. :D
---
Where are the vending machines? Ok, next!
---
They’re probably at home during off hours
---
This is brilliant.
---
I'm not sure, I'll have to check and see what it needs to craft one
---
I was pointing this shit out back when people were thinking we had to oay for seasons.
---
I like it...except for the PvP aspects...because fuck that.
---
I fast traveled to tent and my Ally came with me...Sofia getting a little clingy.
---
It's part of the exterior fortifications set, and not theoretically for use in the structure proper. It's one of the few things you can put the big exterior walls against.
---
So I've got a floating house sort of. On the left and right are pairs of these stairs and then there's a mesh floor two by twos in a row, and then going back to blank the house and then the house is built with regular floors and walls inside the gap made by the mesh.
---
So I've got a low wall, big square of mesh, and then my door / wall. The same thing with shutter balls to the left and right of the door. Then a full file of mesh floor going back the length of the house. And then outside of that are the two stairways. and those stairways are resting on concrete foundations.
---
It works pretty nice. 
---
The purpose of the mesh is that you can shoot through it, so it's good for the exterior fortifications if you're going to build a wall around your farm for instance.
---
It's not supposed to be part of the enclosed house proper.
---
I'll be back on shortly so if you add my psn (same as my handle) I'll give you what you need
---
Another reason could be they will be bringing out other stuff that can be bought with bullion, but want you to spend it on stuff that's out now instead of grabbing new stuff day 1.
---
If that person lives you get 250 bullion at the end instead of 500/1k, and they don't do anything afterwards. Something to keep in mind.
---
This is no longer up to date. Just search flamingo unit and you'll find a current cost list.
---
Hey bud, sorry to hear about that :( if you’re talking about the one from the treasure hunter event, I gotchu. No charge. Although I won’t be on until about 2 hours from now so if you still need one by then just lmk :)
---
Headed up there now
---
They won’t do it because all the Bubble Wrap Babies spend shitloads of money on the game and if they did, they would probably quit playing the game (not that they would be missed by the rest of us). If you notice, all the PvP griefers have 1st and own everything in the atom shop. If Bethesda pulls all their legacies, they’ll split and take all that money with them. 
---
Basically, Bethesda cares more about lining their pockets than they do about making a playable game.
---
Awesome! Thanks so much!
---
Ah, neat, I guess I wasn't paying enough attention.
---
I mean mod, there is plenty of them (fallout games always was modded). Since fo76 based on fo4 engine it have plenty of mods on nexus. Like must have inventory addon (makes navigating and sorting items 100 time better), and others good qol addons
---
Edit: for PC ofc
---
So I just got home from work, the damage output does change when I equip demo expert with my gauss rifle.
---
You are very generous with this help, I really appreciate it and have made notes. I do have rank 1 in the three heavy gunner cards and bullet shield and stabilized in INT, no room for others.
---
I'll mod my PA for emergency protocols and give that try.
---
Ok but you're also not jogging, sprinting, climbing jumping, shooting, crouch walking, etc all over mountainous terran for miles and miles while carrying ~300lbs on your back all day and night. Not to mention all that construction work which is also done all day and night. 
---
Give your man his 5 steaks. He earned it.
---
IMO its an AMAZING IDEA, the first fast travell buff is balanced for all factions exept mothman, and the other buffs have to be regulated bc everyone would go with foundation, I also thinf BRC shluld give +50 to carry wheigth or a +20% buff
---
Kid needs me hang on a few
---
Sorry, bad math. I’ve read some comments from bloodied unyielding talking about their having sneak at 40 or so, so why would they bother with a stealth build, is what they’ve said. Guessing they got individual AGI bonuses from their armor on top of the +3, possibly mutating, bird bones gives +4. Herd immunity mute gives +2 to all specials when teamed up. Yeah, but still a stretch to get out of the 30s without all of those things being in place.
---
Yeah that’s the one and thank you very much I appreciate the kind offer! :D I could still pay you just for being so nice but I’ll definitely let you know, my gt is Sensei Miachi
---
If your trying to revive downed players. Head to encrypted. I took a pylon and just supported others who were better equipped to deal with it all. Heal anyone who gets downed and usually people go down.
---
and that 1 dev only has a casio calculator watch to work with
---
No need for caps, seriously. These really don’t cost much to make haha. I can even give you 2 extra just in case this accidentally happens again :)
---
I like the general idea, a lot, actually. 
---
But the BoS, as we can tell by the decoded messages from the upcoming quests, are Lawful Evil at best. Authoritarian techno-hoarders that expect us to feed and shelter them at gunpoint like a bunch of serfs.
---
Neutral? Not hardly. The Enclave is more neutral than the BoS at this point.
---
I havent done one lately because im leveling a new toon who will die with a quickness if I go
---
I’m surprised they haven’t just upgraded it to 1000lbs. It’s a nice round number.
---
Huh they've must have changed it then good to know. I'm curious though try shooting it at your feet.
---
This. I’m a solo player and whenever I saw the “Complete events in a group” challenges I would just have to tell myself, yeah, that’s not happening.
---
I am become death
---
Yeah OP, why are the servers down? The heck
---
I would say give it a shot tomorrow. We're getting the first big content update since Wastelanders, so when you get on there will be a ton of stuff to do. If you haven't played since release you'll probably be pleasantly surprised with all the new NPCs and quests to do, may feel a lot more like a Fallout experience you didn't get initially.
---
A lot of people will likely be doing the same, so it should be a good time.
---
ROFL!
---
The weapon durability is the same thing (I hate durability too), but your other points aren't. Hunger, thirst, and item durability affects absolutely everybody, ammo doesn't. Ammo is a means to an end that does not affect all builds equally, therefore it has a use. Item durability, hunger, and thirst do not provide any sort of challenge or benefit at all (which isn't to say that food doesn't). Acquiring ammunition does have a benefit (you get to shoot things). Player health does provide a challenge, the challenge to stay alive, so getting stimpaks isn't a waste.
---
As long as the ones remaining don't turn hostile
---
Yeah those also.  But as long as you let folks get hits in and don't be a dork fish then everything is fine.
---
Wait for real? I was wondering why I haven't heard that in a while, guess that explains it lol
---
I think the Brotherhood is taking over the Observatory when they launch. 
---
This is such a good idea.
---
Interesting! I love the functionality of that piece given it's special properties.
---
I recently built the camp I've been envisioning for a while. It's called ["The Wedge"](https://i.imgur.com/Q3ffCjr.png) and the initial idea was to have it be only one block wide. It was a real struggle taking advantage of all the space and those mesh stair pieces were mandatory, as the vault stairs took up an entire block width. I eventually settled on a two column width and it's exactly what I intended and comfortably fits full vault stairs. I have a mesh stair in the locked off power room where people won't see it.
---
Jusus christ your acting like i just burned down a church. This is my opinion. No need to cry about it because you dont like it.
---
Rest in Todd howards chess club...
---
This may be a dumb question, however, is this like an auto patch they take care of and when we log in it'll be there? Or do I need to physically press an update button in my Xbox's queue? I understand it's tomorrow, but I'll be at work and just want to know if my wife needs to update it for me haha
---
its free for everyone, this season and every future season
---
Mind blown, been playing since launch and have just sold mine, which isn't a complete waste but had I known
---
It’s free for everybody
---
Looks really nice, with the exception of PvP. Uninstanced PVP should stay away from the game...
---
Free for everyone
---
Oh, this usually helps me. Then ill go to a a full system shut down then turn that back on and it usually fixes it
---
Yeah for sure, likely to be what I do if I go that route.
---
No worries. I’m ready when you are!
---
So true...
---
I must not be, thanks!
---
Free for all players
---
Hmm. If you already have the game play the quests for the story. Other than that if you did not like it before you probably wont now. Its still grindy and buggy.
---
They've already adjusted that, public teams won't allow people to build at your camp (not that they could scrap anything they didn't build themselves) nor even initiate PvP with another person to anyone but themselves.
---
...Provided that functions correctly.
---
Same here. I've never do less than 1000 damage (sometimes much more than that), which isn't much compared to meta builds but historically has been more than enough to qualify for the the drop, lately I get loot about 25% of the time...
---
Well as a Responder I get locked into endless PvP/escort apparently (cheers to dying all the time) while you get a home field advantage and legendaries (multiple) to your door hahaha But in all seriousness the 'flavour' you've gone with for each I really, really like and the graphics/chart you made looks incredible.
---
if you're on now i can sort you out for free
---
Very interesting but let’s be real. Wish you’d put this much thought into the legendary perks feedback which they’re still adjusting. Like 95% of the feedback is “scrap this! This sucks!” Which is not an option.
---
Anytime, let me know if you have any specific questions, yab is the man, his guide is great.
---
Thanks for the link.
---
Bright side I've heard you can create a public team of just yourself
---
Yeah but what about the premium part of the pass
---
Never spent a single atom since I got the game in Dec 2018. I’m rich in atoms lol
---
Ladders would be dope
---
Swap to unyielding with vampiric melee weapons if you want to tank. I only die when I get 1shot, which is fairly uncommon.
---
Or in other words
---
Thank you daily and weekly challenges for being the complete opposite of ash heap treasure hunt.
---
Nope, using a vehicle should double the cost of fast travel, gotta fuel that baby up after all.
---
Hahah yeah. Guess they'll probably give some other debuff to it
---
Your build is actually not bad.  IMO you need to make room for Lifegiver 3 or 4, even at the expense of lowering sneak, class freak if you don't run mutations with large negative effects, or maybe tone down lone wanderer. You already have Action Boy, Lone wanderer and Grim Reaper's sprint, and there is a cap on AP refresh that I think you might be beyond with so many AP perks.  You could also move points from Agility since Mister sandman only works at night and they recently reduced the night cycle significantly.  Food for thought anyway.  The positive effects of lifegiver will keep you alive much more.  1 rank of radicool would also improve your quality of life quite a bit.

---
Watch Angry Turtle's videos.  He will teach you all that you need to know.
---
Edit: I just re-read the OP, and I should mention that with Rad Resistance of only 50, you really need to carry and use a lot of radshield and probably run the lead lined backpack.  That will fix the rad problem.
---
If you want to know how craft tons of radshield, browse my recent replies in other threads, It is explained in detail.
---
Are you playing a bloodied build?
---
Totally. 15 minutes of walking around gathering ingredientes (or more if you don't have an SSD for your loading screens) are just not worth it,
---
Shhhh dont tell Todd
---
If a heavy weapon has the exploding effect on it, it classifies it still as a heavy weapon
---
Yes but it's shared with the USE feature which you need frequently.
---
I've been crazy about lofts in my builds. I don't need a whole second story for a bedroom. Plus it would be a huge space saver.
---
If they introduced this I would so redesign my camp around it--and I've only ever really changed my core camp design once for the contemporary bundle.
---
So, it would benefit from the perk cards for heavy gunners?
---
why is it safe to say construction vehicles were functioning?
---
Honestly, I hate challenges on the lines of "kill 100 mole rats with a boxing glove".
---
It's as bad as forcing solo players (which I am) to group up. 
---
Just give fun challenges. Don't force us to go out of our way to change our play styles.
---
Players can get usually interested in PVP, if the implementation of PVP allows them roflstomping newbies into dust. Basically, once the PVP system incentivises fair fights and disallows griefing, most of the so-called "PVPers" lose interest...
---
quadruple + 50 scrip
---
I have capped out several times on the glowing blood alone.
---
Yes I believe, I use a bloodied explosive laser Gatling and it benefits from them.
---
the premium "part" does not exist.  bethesda actually already released all the rewards for this season, which can be found here:
---

---
edit: formatting
---
Plans change. Players didn't end up using PVP, so investing more into it would be wasted resources...
---
Awesome, I’m in the process of leveling up and moving points to S and I to build a heavy gunner and power armor user. So I wanted to make sure. Thanks!
---
I run a junkies heavy PA build and I'd like to see a buff. Even if it's just more carry weight or no fusion cores anymore
---
fucking minecraft yo.. fucking minecraft
---
Don't let these people nitpick your idea man. It doesn't have to be rock solid to prove your point. It's an awesome idea and I fully support it. I definitely think more agency and consequence in choosing factions would be interesting.
---
If its getting killed fast than your not doing enough damage. If its a normal fight then i have no idea
---
No probs
---
I’ve liked the idea someone had of bikes or even scooters lol 
---
Maybe a Brahmin pulled cart
---
I'm crying about it? Read your first comment on this thread. You are the one acting like an entitled little twat that thinks that everyone else should be playing the game just like you. Play the game how you like but don't come here telling people how they should play the game and how something you personally don't like should be taken away from the rest of us. As people using bloodied/unyielding has ZERO effect on you.
---
Alright, to try to be objective...
---
It reads more like a review of Bethesda than Fallout 76. You've scored the game very low, but haven't really given many reasons for this apart from the copied assets from Fallout 4 thing (which as others have said ignores all the new creatures in this game). You mention that more player testing &amp; debugging is something they need to do, but haven't in the review described the game's bugginess (which would absolutely be a fair thing to tell potential players about). You say almost nothing about the actual gameplay, including the areas it does differ to F4 (VATS, skills, mandatory survival, how CAMPS differ to settlements, etc.), or some of the questlines you go through (such as commenting on how it feels doing quests for dead people and robots, in many cases). Basically, your review doesn't say very much about the actual game.
---
I haven't downvoted this because you've scored a game I personally enjoy quite low. I've downvoted because I fundamentally don't think this is a very good review.
---
I can buy MODUS as not evil. But the Raiders definitely are. They are all about stealing from the Settlers and other wastelanders and don't even shy away from murder when their target doesn't cooperate. That's basically post-apocalyptic mafia and mafias were evil to the bone...
---
Did it in this sub version of the game... yeah, when you have to add a subversion to even try to argue, you’ve already failed.
---
At least that would make that one daily easier.
---
Nope
---
Settlements in Fo4 function actually really well. They are a core feature of the game...
---
There's not much I can give you. Maybe craft you a sniper rifle for your level, but it wont be legendary.
---
lag, poor performance on ps4 during fights, hits not registering, overall if they fix the desync I will be the most happy person on the world
---
Fast travelling to a players base and spawning under there base
---
Is there a perk I need to reduce rads in Nuke zones?
---
I got FO76 on release - played about 3 months until my PS4 shot craps.  Bought a new one and started playing again in April.  I missed all the vault experiences.  Sad days...
---
I hear so much about how ugly this game is all the time.
---
Maybe it's just from being a mostly-RPG-player my whole life, but when I see big, open-ended games like this I don't expect to be blown away by the graphics every moment of play.
---
The textures, pop-in, wonky animations, and glitches all hurt a bit, but god damn it, the landscapes and views in this game *are* gorgeous and the view off my camp's porch is so picturesque it's my favorite loading screen. I love traveling to Vault 76 and looking out over that vista at the distant weather systems and going "I want to explore *that* place," then being able to do so.
---
Awfully optimistic of you to expect fixes with a new update. I only expect more bugs.
---
Not everyone, I’d do enclave or the brotherhood
---
There is a perk called “Rad Resistant” which gives +40 rad resistance at lvl 5, but I suggest using PA, hazmat suit, or getting the Chinese stealth suit.
---
I wouldn't count on ladders ever making it into the game, apparently it's too much trouble to get AI to pathfind up them.

 My beverage  of choice (inert flux), boil water for cooking. Purified water for selling.
---
So basically what I’m doing and also keeping Radaway and Rad X handy. Cool thanks again.
---
I think the hunger and thirst should stay but be scaled back. Two bottles of water in a day would be more than sufficient to keep someone alive. Same with one decent meal. I think we can handle that and it keeps the survival element around without making it compulsory to eat any festering crap you find in an old box just to keep going every five minutes.
---
I fully support being able to PLAY instead of cook every two seconds, but why even have purifiers and crops now? I dunno I think Beth needs to pick a direction and stay with it. We are a survivalist game and that was definitely the intent.
---
Wish Bethesda did the same thing sea of thieves did with the instruments. Edit: Maybe let us choose what our avatars sound like so they can sing along with the instruments.
---
Based on the fact that they just showed up after the raiders took over Crater, these vehicles just appeared there. I highly doubt the raiders dragged them there if they were useless, and while we are never told they are active, I feel it is safe to assume they are. In addition, there is a holotape at the free radicals camp that implies vehicles can still run, especially since they are trying to put a minigun on a limo.

I've always, always wanted a motorcycle or vehicle in Fallout, but it really won't work any other way than how you suggested, a fast travel discount.
---
I hate that. Unfortunately the engine just can't handle you moving too quickly, and even boosting your movement speed too much in FO4 would break the game.

---
2. Burn the door down with a flame thrower trap.  
---
3. Put a pressure plate switch where the powered door was.  
---
4. Repair the powered door, hook the pressure plate up to your door.
---
Presto! You now have self-closing doors operated from both sides with a single pressure plate.
---
I'll canceled now my first, leave this shit Bug Game
---
Got my herd mentality and empath serum ready for solo public team =)
---
I am on right now, do you want me to join you? And could I maybe trouble you to craft 2 extras so I’ll have a backup if I accidentally do it again lol?
---
Shotgun, pistol, unarmed, melee, rifle/bow, explosive, and heavy are builds. Bloody and Junkie are play styles. I can switch between the two depending on the situation on five builds. People who are just focusing on a bloody play style are in for a rude awakening when new vault raids come out.

Neutral and a pissed off Brahmin.  With most trucks having tow hook points on them it would be a very decent way too tow something if you needed vs. building a wagon specifically for it.

You could hook up a team to the vehicle and have the vehicle towing a trailer loaded with supplies behind it.

Aye no bother

Bullet shield will be a waste since PA is already almost at the cap for DR, better to use Blocker since that'll help with her melee attacks when you're up in her face. Other than that those perks are all I use too.
---
But what amount would be reasonable? $40 would only represent about a thirds progress. Even if 1st members were to sink their monthly into it, that'd only be 33 levels. 
---
Still I think I prefer this way, as opposed to buying it and working to earn the items, with a chance of not getting what you paid for. (My only experience with a "season pass" was with Red Dead and that's how it worked) I just have a problem with Bethesda's evaluation of its worth.
---
Got mine with no problems, but think I had zoom lenses.  Have you tried taking pics of dead ones?  Those count too.

Nope you won't get downvoted anyways and still couldn't they rebuild? like the minutemen

Sent you a friend request.  The stupid social system doesn't work right 95 percent of the time though so you will probably need to do the same and it will add me as a friend automatically.

If you already got your revive though no worries.

I’d personally do the Brotherhood. I’ve had my T-60 PA decked out for a while now, been using the BoS Elder paint from turning in Tech Data since I got it. It’s just my go everywhere, do everything set of PA.
---
I love closing doors because it’s makes the base more fortified and safe feeling.
---
Free for everyone but if you don’t want to grind out the Score then you can purchase the ranks. That’s the money part. It does not sound hard to earn ranks but it does sound like another grind.
---
I have no doors. Problem solved
---
I don’t know if it still works but if you craft a Gatling laser it should give you a free fusion core. Doesn’t require flux if you do it this way.
---
Calm down nerds. Casuals pay the bills. Beta elitists just hangout on reddit and tell each other how hardcore they are.

Not really.

There's a lamp of him holding up a moon that serves as the bulb. It's cute but not as cute as the plush. Still, my Mr. Pebbles shrine wouldn't be complete without it.

Thank you sir, I really appreciate it! 🙏
---
Ok. Ha. I do, too. I went back especially for that cat one but it didn't spawn yet
---
That would fit if only trucks and buses were used, but there is also a construction digging vehicle there, one with a bucket for digging up dirt (I’d give the proper name if I knew it). That wouldn’t work out very well for moving supplies.
---
From what I remember, there is also a farming vehicle of some sort (one that rolls the ground for sowing seeds, I believe) at the crop fields, which definitely wouldn’t be there if it wasn’t being useful.
---
Hide yo kids, hide yo wife.

They could get rid of the food system completely as far as I care...
---
To me it adds nothing to the game.  I just chug some corn soup every now and then to make some bars go up. 
---
It's a game, not real life.  It should be *fun*.
---
I love how the armor and power armor share a style, thanks for the photo, there are so few pictures of the two armors beside each other. (Any other screen shots will be appreciated).
---
It totally gives me vibes of Iron Man getting into the Hulk-buster armor.
---
Congratulations, it takes a lot of work to complete those sets, I'm only halfway there and I'm burning out.
---
Yeah that happens every so often.
---
Same here, gat lasers would replace cores when there’s still more than a hundred shots left, end up with bunch of near empty cores, very annoying.

&gt;icals until you get a server where they've spawned. Night or day doesn't matter, although they'
---
I'd like to add something that I have discovered.  First, as others have said, make sure to equip Green Thumb first.  If you find a server that has the blooms and then pick the ones that are blooming, a server hop can yield blooms on only the ones that you have not yet harvested. But, I hop about 3-5 more times and usually end up harvesting all of them by the time I am finished.  By doing this, and crafting the radshields with Super Duper and Chemist active, I usually net around 60 radshields for no more than 30 minutes of grinding.  That many will last me for at least a week.
---
If you can't find any Blooms (Which for me is very rare), a workaround is to VPN to another region and try again.
---
I use the same method when crafting formula P, which greatly increases accuracy.   Making 30 or 40 is really easy in 30 minutes time by visiting the river between Flatwoods and the Overseer's Camp for the Bloodleaf, Arktos for the Kaleidopore, and Lewisburg Rooftops/Welch for the Ash Rose.  You can use this same method every day if you like.  Both of these Chems sell quite well in your vendor if you have too many.
---
only if I get to shoot them in the face to death

That definitely sucks I know it doesn’t feel good, but isn’t meat week supposedly coming back soon? I didn’t play last meat week but I do want that tenderizer for my melee build lol.

Awesome! I thought they had to be alive.. difficult to take pictures mid combat lol, I don't know why it won't register the ones I already took, my photomode gallery is full of them

Bethesda should hire OP.  Very comprehensive suggestion.  This would enrich the game greatly and allow any number of player driven end game activities.
---
I'm good on fusion cores, I just wanted to craft a jetpack
---
minecraft is pretty fucking casual yo..
---
It also needs to say their name in the corner, I've found moving around stops that sometimes so try taking them standing still.
---
Your example is a fairly common mob, and would still be awful in a weekly setting. There are uncommon or rare mobs and would be much worse.
---
Not only is that a good idea, it means we'd see the GECK room more often and that had a really interesting layout.  
---
That said, I'd be happy even if they brought it back in the old ways so I could introduce the Heart to my matte, new Gauss Minigun.  
---
Though if they did, I'd love if something was included that would either let you upgrade Strangler to around T-65, or simply a Strangler design comparable to T-65 in stats.  
---
That dot was actually handy once you got used to it and the plant growth was pretty cool.

I have this absolute love/hate thing with Fallout graphics. It's like 2/3 of the game looks stunning. The other third looks ...broken. When it's gorgeous, it's gorgeous, but those other times, phew. Things i love: the sun, the night sky, landscapes and trees and ruined towns in the distance, the fog and diffused light... all the weather, really. (The clouds visually disintegrating into rain is such a nice detail in the game.) Things that make me want to throw the screen in the trash: FACES... all the janky ugly faces that look like they're made out of a mix of burlap and rubber, the lighting that seems to be great everywhere BUT those faces, so. much, clipping., and critters. OH MY GOD the critters horrify me. Not because they're irradiated and half jerky, but the way they movie like they're tin toys on rails and stare into space... I just got a icky shiver thinking about them.  
---
P.S. It's not just 76. I got 4 on pc a few weeks ago, and modded the crap out of it, and it's so beautiful i can't top playing it, just to look around while i'm shooting things.
---
That's my luck everyday
---
Dont give them ideas 0_o I can see it now kill 10 mystical aliens with the alien blaster
---
I’m more along the lines of mirv minigun guns and the laser 50 cals shotguns
---
How do you give away NW camp items?
---
The pipe gun is really not that great, but pipe revolver and pipe bolt-action are amazing. They double dip into rifle and pistol perks if you install a rifle stock. So just stack rifleman perks and gunslinger perks and your damage goes through the roof.
---
My current character is using pipe weapons straight from level 1 to level 300 without switching to other weapon types. I currently run a Bloodied Pipe Revolver Rifle and do 3.5k damage with a sneak headshot or up to 5.5k when I fully buff it. Both is enough to oneshot almost everything.
---
For the love of fuck, yes. Please let me paint that awful ceiling. Ghetto as fuck.
---
Any kind of way to go to another floor that only takes up one single floor tile would be amazing
---
Yeah this one I’ve got I can 2-hit a deathclaw and assaultrons. I absolutely melt things in VATS and it’s got the 33% reduced cost one. I don’t want my god gun to go away. &lt;/3

Ohh so PC

There's the black roofing in one of the bundles, I want to say it was the Springtime bundle or something titled like that, but I'm not sure if it changes the look of the interior ceilings. Probably doesn't.

I've always hated that my ceilings look so drab in comparison to the fancy atom shop stuff, but I barely notice anymore since it's always been this way.

It's always like this.

Man I love this subreddit.  I gave you an upvote but for some reason we both got downvotes because THEY PUT A SLAB OF ROCK IN FRONT OF THE DOOR.

It was even in the patch notes when it happened.  Could not care less about my internet points but what the hell?? There is a rock there, deal with it lol.

also the playground and one of the bathrooms at camden park are sometimes bloatfly spawns..

---
Well you get tank killer perk under perception and the anti armor perks for the bows under perception and there are some very powerful bows out there. Stabilized is the reason why any heavy gunner even uses PA. Take it away or nerf it and you've effectively killed one of the most effective perks heavy gunners get to use.
---
Huntersville....definitely glands in those meat bags
---
I would love to. Possible dumb question, But how would I know besides looking at the numbers on the pip boy? I guess I could craft another one that isn’t ffr and see if there is a difference?
---
To be fair, I'm not paying caps to fast travel to look at someone's atom shop items,  mounted heads and the same allies I can have.
---
Ah ok I was confused due to the come on by part.
---
I mean no disrespect, but pipe weapons are supposed to be the lowest tier ranged weapons. Otherwise they'd just be a re-skin of the handmade.
---
Lol, wait until she lands and make sure there are no mobs hiding that screw up sneak criticals.  Sneak and aim for the head.  10 is about normal if she is aggro'ed on some radroach hiding in the bushes. You'll probably hit 50-60 if you do this.
---
this is where I would go.. but I suggest lower lvl areas because not everyone is prepared to go there.. lol
---
you can pretty much get all of stings and things there if youre lucky.. tons of bags
---
What, and spoil a good challenge?
---
Not true when you factor in legendary effects like bolstering and vanguards and not to mention unyielding with increased special stats. You can have a three effects for each piece max plus a mod slot and there are some really good mods out there. So don't give me it's already too powerful because PA can get outclassed against those armors.
---
I hadn't realised that their name had to be there, thanks for the tip I will try that.
---
20% weight reduction for ammo/junk/weapons/food,drinks,chems would be nice.
---
Happened to enough times that I now equip my stealth suit before getting into PA for nuke zones.
---
Still occasionally get rad-killed when I log into nuke zones tho.

---
I'm waiting to see what will break and how long until it's fixed before I look forward to any new features, especially when the new feature is a battle pass and a group feature that's entirely unnecessary.
---
I'd rather have mechanical and balance changes before any of this new fluff.
---
There's only a few? Damn, I'll take some more screenshots with a more look into the armour tomorrow and post here 
---
Yeah now that you mention it, it does give an Iron Man feel 
---
It does but it's worth it, I'm used to long term grinds and my advice is don't look at the entire goal, break it down, like say you need the Torso and limbs, focus on the limbs like 300 more gold to go then just take a day or 2 and grind out the 200 gold then look at the next one, it surprisingly makes the grind feel less grindy
---
Commenting just incase someone answers
---
200 x 4 = 800. So if you've got close to 800 for a year you'd be almost getting to completing all seasons. And it's not like everyone will fully complete every season anyway, same as you probably didn't complete every single daily/weekly challenge. Unless you're a completionist there'll be some atoms/levels still on the table
---
something around the lines of, get the fire place. place it dead center of your camp. open and close it 5 times. Open it 1 more time, run through 16 total times, in exactly 17.3 seconds and let a rad roach kill you, then you will have 1 extra spoiled meat.
---
And also would save camp budget space- possibly lightening the load on the server!
---
 Rather it's true or not it's a little late to even bother with it at this point.
---
Me too, seems way worse on my ultracide. I’ll end a fight with 10 cells all 13/500

No need my good sir! Looks like it is in  the “powered gates” plan. Seemingly Graham sells it, and occasionally the vendor in Harper’s Ferry does. But I appreciate your willingness to check.
---
no idea if true, but i hope so
---
it would be nice of them to force stuff like presents/pails to auto open on next login after the event ends to combat the problem
---
Yeah, my friends and I have been playing for about a month, and it's struck us how different and largely friendly the community is in *Fallout 76* versus, say, *Grand Theft Auto: Online*. In *GTA* you're kind of incentivized toward PvP, and thus always on edge when a random player shows up nearby—and often shocked when they're friendly. *Fallout*, on the other hand, incentivizes you to be friendly and work together, trade, and help out, because you're all collectively trying to survive in post-apocaplytia, and it's created a much more enjoyable experience as a result of this element, at least for me. My friends and I have played *GTA: Online* fairly regularly over the past few years, but for the past month we've just been hopping on long enough to spin the wheel at the Casino, grab the visitor bonus chips, and then go hop into *Fallout 76*.
---
We all came into *76* on the defense, expecting people to be assholes the way they are in *GTA* (one of us even going so far as to sign up for a month of Fallout 1st so we could all play on a private server while we were all low-level), but it hasn't really been the case very often, and once we incidentally discovered how friendly and generous most higher level players are, rather than being hostile, and how much more enriching interacting with other players can be, we abandoned the private server method pretty quickly. It's made me love this game in a way I haven't felt about *GTA* in years. It'd end up being such a disappointment if Bethesda changed that. I don't want to have to constantly be rebuilding my C.A.M.P. after someone attacks it because they perceive me as being part of a rival faction, or (in usual *GTA* style), just wants to be a dick for their own amusement.
---
Dude you don't even need hacked weps there's in game non exploit weps that do exactly the Same thing, legit in game drops. 
---
Go look up angry turtle on Yt and watch his magic weps video, medics was steath changed but the rest worked as of 2 days ago.  Magic + bloodied = queen vaporized solo
---
to keep people from doing the dupe, I didn't mention how long you have to wait and where you have to respawn at.
---
Oh god not this again. I'm having bloatfly gland flashbacks. took me 4 bloody hours to find one months ago. And then someone was all 'Check meatbags in huntersville' and i found 7 in 2 minutes. i could have cried.
---
I have no idea what is reasonable. We don’t have details yet. All I know is I can’t imagine anyone paying the full $120. But if they do... thanks for supporting while the rest of us get free content. 
---
And I totally agree. The idea of paying for the privilege to earn rewards doesn’t sit well with me at all.
---
Lt. Dan?
---
you drink it.
---
I like finding a way into locked buildings. Today I got through a 3rd floor window by climbing their power connectors.
---
Cool camps are nice to look at. Locked door for generator rooms is fine - stops allies leaving it open for hordes.
---
Pointlessly locked rooms simply because? That then is simply a challenge to get in.
---
Free for all, also not called a battle pass.
---
But it wouldn’t be useful to actually move anything unless it could be turned back on.
---
I can't decide which armor I want it on. It's between T-60 or T-51
---
LOL, good one but no. The homeless fella rolling through the subway cars on a skateboard in K.I.D.S.
---
Try a dead one - even exploded pieces will count (I use Bloody Mess Perk so that happens a lot to me).  And you need to make sure that the name of the creature/site/person etc. shows up in the top right corner of the screen before you snap the pic.  Otherwise it won't register as complete.
---
Hopes this helps
---
I found needing to eat and drink one of the lesser annoyances myself. If they want things to be less annoying they can just reduce weights or increase carry weight/storage limits. 
---
Another suggestion would be to eliminate (or greatly reduce) ammo weight, this would have the added benefit of making weapons that no one uses because of ammo weight actually usable.
---
All season passes will be free. Basically a while back Bethesda promised that all DLC, updates and additions will be free and they won't make the game a pay to win. That's why you don't see anything game breaking in the Atom Shop (Fridges don't count to me because you still have a refrigeration backpack and good with salt), so if you're that "food conscious" and don't wanna spend atoms, there is a way.
---
Cherish it whilst it lasts my friend once they hit their normal ammo count limit it goes away. 
---
I had it with my bloodied lever action. Had over 500 ammo before it ever needed reloading, was a weird but excellent bug. 
---
It appears it’s something to do with weapon swapping/loading in when you have a gun with over 500 ammo capacity. It happened to me using the Gatling laser and the lever action was only other gun I had on me sadly.
---
You play Dayz too eh?
---
Anytime you happen to see campfire tales pop up go to it.  Spawns everything you need to finish stings and things.  You can stock up on everything except the radroach meat that spoils and store it in a vending machine for a ludicrous price so it doesn't get bought (also just don't power it up so it doesn't show on the map unless you run vending anyways). If someone buys one of them for 25,000 caps then "okay?"
---
Tag everything you can there and loot the piles after the event.  Can usually stock up on a weeks worth of stuff.  You'll probably see that event pop up more than one time a week lol.
---
I have to thank you though bc you did remind me of the fun and wonder I had when I first took that trolley to the gauntlet...maybe I was looking back with shit tinted glasses. But yeah I do think F4 suffered from cut content, bc there was so much potential. I really wanted to see that underwater stuff, and if you haven't heard about the OG Salem quest, you should read into it. It perfectly sums up the game going from RPG questing to FPSing
---
On the topic of F76...I think Bethesda is taking steps in the right direction &amp; I do think there is a love for this game from the team. A lot of Wastelanders dialogue (especially Julie's) can feel like the developers directly speaking to us. This game, despite its problems, is crafted w a lot of love and care. Noclip's documentary really opened my eyes to that. I HOPE we will get to stick with it for longer bc there is limitless potential for this game.
---
Pipe weapons are easy to repair. With Licensed Plumber the condition goes down quite slowly. However, Gunsmith acts on weapons with the keyword "[ranged](https://nukacrypt.com/database/json/004987FD)" and LP acts on "[pipe](https://nukacrypt.com/database/json/0033843B)." The only weapon in the [pipe](https://nukacrypt.com/database/json/00338439) category that is also [ranged](https://nukacrypt.com/database/json/0033A7C8) is the syringer. You can put those Gunsmith perks to other uses if you are going for a full time pipe weapon build.
---
I gave you a shout out on Twitter. Now all 9 of my 500 some odd followers who give a shit that I'm covering Fallout content on YouTube will know of your hard work and big ideas!

---
I have been craving a solid faction system since NV please please pleaaaaaaaaaaaase give us something like this
---
I had this happen with my pipe revolver, like 200 round clip, eventually fixed itself
---
I dunno where people are getting the "1000 damage" from, because it feels incorrect. (Is there some source on that, by the by?)
---
Personally, it feels like it's actually percentage-based damage, not a flat 1000. Specifically, it's percentage-based damage *in comparison to the other players present*.
---
To give an example; A few queen fights we've manage to whittle her down to half health, which she regens as expected, but then some overpowered (or possibly hacking) asshole turns up and 1-shots her from full health. Nobody got any loot, except them.  
---
I suspect it's because all the damage done by the rest of us, individually, was so small in comparison to that one player percentage-wise, that the game gives the loot to that one player and not to the rest of us. Even though plenty of us did over 1000 damage to her.  
---
In contrast, when everyone seems to be doing comparable damage to each other, everyone gets loot. Probably because everyone present has similar percentage-based damage.
---
Coming from someone who has played since the beginning of BETA and only took a two month break to try out Anthem (which sucked) I would say you should. Don't go into the game thinking it's a solo game because it is built for teamplay and it's a multiplayer game, not a solo one. But I would absolutely try to come back and experience all you have missed out on. 
---
Updates since release:
---
Wild Appalachia
---
Nuclear Winter
---
Wastelanders
---
all the quality of life improvements and game improvements. 
---
The number of side quests has increased.
---
NOTE: Don't fast travel everywhere. Experience the newness that the game offers after Wastelanders and see all that the little stories out there has to offer. Sure the beginning story is slow and hard to follow, but all the side stories are totally worth it if you can keep up. If you are on PS4 feel free to DM me and I'd be happy to give you a crash course back into the game!

I still have a couple wrapping paper and a few presents I saved just for the hell of it, I guess we'll see tomorrow...
---
Honestly, that was a really wholesome reply.
---
That’s actually very good. All I’m getting lately is one star wood armor pieces even from bosses.
---
See, I’ve gotten them down to their original clip size before and then the next time I load the game it’s back up again
---
Hope so.
---
Even more bizarre than what I experienced then, lucky you. Soon as my lever action hit 4 shots I could reload and it stayed at 5. Took me days to get there, was good fun.
---
I craft heaps of ammunition then it takes like a  minute or two to show up in my inventory
---
I've been surviving on spoiled meat/veg and inert flux for a long time, I'd be happy with a standalone key for eating that just consumed a random unspoiled food.
---
Why exactly would I be reading patch notes for a game I hadn't even started playing yet? I only started four weeks ago. There hasn't even been a big update since I started playing.
---
Edit: Ah, were you talking about whoever downvoted you? I think that just happens here. I've stopped concerning myself with it.  I've heard it's bots, so I don't think it's someone not believing you.
---
Currently it’s one of the least affected weapons by the  vats bug. 
---
Throw it on auto and it’s great in pvp. Especially if it’s faster fire.
---
So what are we speculating the bugs with seasons will be? 
---
 - Everything is already completed and claimed when you log in and you get nothing of the rewards. It will take weeks for this to be resolved, because support will be slammed with tickets about this. 
---
 - Some sort of exploit where people are able to claim, unlimited; Scrip, Caps, Bullion, Atoms and Lunchboxes..
---
 - Things just not triggering as being completed, like the picking up silo codes weekly.. This will halt some people from moving forward into the season. And will not be fastly fixed. 
---
 - Some sort of wipe of Atoms, Caps, Bullion or Scrip. Or all.. 
---
This is all just speculation, but what do you think is most likely?

---
Thats what I would suggest as a starting point????
---
Then you have to mod your weapons for VATS critical and AP usage.
---
VATS perks add considerably more to your damage output than weapon perks do, so I normally run night eyes, glow sight, and level 1&amp;2 commando perks. I utilize a wide range of VATS legendary weapons (Shotguns and Pistols) and regularly do more damage with a 10MM pistol than all but the sweatiest meta-builds.
---
Im totally down for it, limiting the faction choices to three (if you include the eventual arrival of the brotherhood as Bethesda announced) is a total waste of the others. I literally play as a Free States character and I'd love to see more people do so with the rest of the factions. If I was able to make an Enclave outpost I totally would, regardless of the rewards. The Responders (Fire-Breathers) and the Free States are both badass groups that could have fought very hard against the Raiders and the Brotherhood. Honestly, it doesn't sound that hard to program and it would make the in-game world definitively more interesting.
---
lol. 
---
such a scenic trip
---
Nice one mate, I've got a qffr one so I was interested to see if they were decent
---
lol... I literally just got one from Free Range.
---
Believe it or not everyone, the stash limit and building budget are actually there to help the server run smoothly. All that unique player data actually adds up, and is stored somewhere.      
---
         
---
If say there was no limits, a camp with 10,000 nuka cola animated lamps placed, could crash players that walk past, or even the host server.
---
Thx so Much! I had no idea !
---
expensive but worth it !
---
Youre the Best

---
Well only 94 was opened...the rest are still a mystery and I'm happy they are taking their time with them again. Their first attempt was ok...but not what traditionally how they execute vaults in their games. 
---
Remember vaults tell stories about what happened, what experiments went on, what was its purpose, etc. 94...never really did that and you had wave after wave of creatures attacking you if you even tried to read any info you could find, which made it very unpleasant to learn more about the vault. I'm hoping they execute the vaults as more massive dungeons with plenty of story or even a server wide public event where you all get to explore the vault. I know they are taking another look at how they will take a look and execute how they will work because the "raid" style of play wasn't that popular.
---
Isn't VATS technically an aimbot?
---
A bloodied commando will kill spawn faster then gun fu can change targets...the only hope other ppl have of killing spawn at the queen is while they reload, or breaking line of sight so they have to re-vats. No hacking, no magic weapons, just an issue of builds being stronger then mobs.
---
Gotcha. I heard about that, but when just said garage doors I wondered what else was wrong. I made a makeshift 2x2 building that uses a garage door until the prefab comes out.
---
Is that canvas? 👀
---
Man i wish the treasure hunter hat wasnt glitching
---
That’s a pvp monster from personal experience!
---
Thanks! I watched the video Oxhorn did addressing those claims a while ago, but didn't realize he did those strikes. I'll definitely check out the one by Right Opinion. Thank you again!
---
I’m talking about the two shot mirv minigun sand the laser explosive shotgun 50 cal machine guns
---
Naw, The highwayman took 100 microfusion cells and it was full
---
I wish to thank you all
---
I was quite discouraged when I saw the mess...
---
then I followed your advice, Repaired it all on 1 button
---
Expensive, but worth it
---
Thx again, bets community everywhere
---
and Yes, it was a Nuke... Next time, I logoff !
---
Dosent have to be bloodied either, junkies and instigating will do the same thing with a bit of adrenaline
---
No I’m talking about the mirv minigun and the laser explosive shotgun 50 cals
---
Thanks! I'll definitely be sure to download it back on my Xbox when I get home from work. It was just so buggy and it felt so empty compared to some of the other "modern" Fallout titles.
---
Nice try silly rabbit, Ticks are for kids
---
I would almost prefer them doing something like this manually. I mean, they would still probably screw it up but...
---
I can just see them copy/pasting an updated template over the old one and being off by a cell and  the entire system goes bellyup.
---
I mean ffxiv has the decency to do it late at night and it is ready usually around 2 to 3 am in the morning
---
Haha agreed. Both the new hats look really silly lol.
---
You don't get many? Lol I thought I'd share my way of grinding, see if it helps, I'm on the game daily just doing my 20 notes
---
Idk what you’re talking about....never heard of either
---
Yeah why???
---
They bring public teams the are joinable in like two clicks they can’t start pvp or build in your camp or loot your locked things.. join one, use photomode and leave.
---
what kind of useful stuff do people get out of the gifts?
---
I've kept a bunch for memorabilia and hand then out occasionally.
---
We're talking like 20 tops.
---
So your jacket ripped a bit? It's the apocalypse, that's bound to happen aha
---
According to the wiki, tank killer and stabilized stack with AA, just at half value. I confirmed it once I found out. As an AA commando I use both to great effect.
---
What are they doing exactly? I think I missed something!
---
I feel this. I get a little sad inside when I see bicycles/motorcycles laying to the side. Pls let me fix you
---
Firstly, great work, I can see you've put in a lot of effort! I feel like this is where the game needs to go, but Bethesda would have to plan it really carefully if it was ever implemented.
---
The problem you have with increasing stash size for just one faction does cause the potential for a lot of bugs, as if players filled their stash then changed factions, you would either lose all stashed items over the limit, or result in some kind of inventory bug where you end up with people exploiting it by changing factions and being able to keep the higher stash size.
---
Great thoughts though on faction based gameplay, as even these could have mini daily quests or a "main questline" like in FO4 where you rise through the ranks of the faction.
---
I’m on pc and you’ll see people with a minigun with a broadsider barrel that fires mirv mininukes or a 50 cal that has a laser barrel that splits the shot with explosive rounds that does 50k dmg per round
---
If they had any sense they would make presents “spoil” 14 days after the event.  Use it or lose it mindset.  The damage is way too far gone now but at least they can stop the bleeding.
---
My comp cant run on anything past low. So it looks like shit all over to me. I see screen shots from other players and get sad that I have bills and cant build a new comp, mine is 11+ years old.
---
Wow...that sux
---
Got the full 94 set just missing a matching hat
---
Saw a gun with a broadsider that had a minigun barrel and the default dmg on it was 950k per shot
---
oh my bad I pass it the part you sayed legendary there, I thought you was saying just moded ones couse pa is way better than any non legendary.
---
tthe  I agree legendary pa it would be nice, but they are still ugly and bulk with bad animations
---
Did not know that, ty
---
Related new fact I learned recently is that killing the end guy with an unarmed weapon still gets you the extra 1*legendary knife.
---
I was doing it with my fists.
---
That’s true. From a realism standpoint it’s silly to make that perk apply out of power armor, since it makes no sense for heavy guns to be used effectively without PA. 
---
What about a straight buff to heavy weapons in return? Heavy weapons become more viable for non-PA users, and by reducing the advantage of stabilized, PA users can more easily branch out to different weapon trees without being at an inherent disadvantage.
---
I put a lock on my front door for some reason. I really don't mind having players wander in and take look around, use benches, bed etc. As a result I just leave my front door standing open. That also means that asshat Dr. Emerson wanders in sometime. Screw that guy.
---
Don’t worry Inkspots, somebody already beat you to it
---
Nothing wrong with that, man. I can't afford to spend a ton on a PC either. I play on Xbox so my graphics probably aren't as good as they could be on a good PC.
---
I’m on ultracite too
---
I swear by the chainsaw with flamer and longbar. You can supposedly amplify it more with the weapon duration increase perk. Shame it doesn't come in a legendary though. Bzzzzrrt! I use that sucker on cryptids, SBQ, etc.
---
I completely agree, and would like to recommend a 50 lb account-wide stash box, with a 12/24 hour timer before items get deleted
---
Fasnacht donuts
---
It sounds like this may not be the game for you. This kind of resource management has been part of these games since Fo3, and resource management is a key part of the post-apocalyptic genre in general.
---
All the lookout points have great shots. Also if you haven't done the quest to take pics of landmarks for the dead grandpa is recommend it. It's neat and you get great shots from it. I found him in the tea pot parking lot.
---
yep you hoard all, like me, I just realized that I had 100lbs of MODs stashed on my camp, and arround 200lb on meds, it feels wrong not take them when I find them don't judge me!
---
edit: remember stash junk only after your destroy all of it or you gonna run out of space pretty fast
---
Yes they are. Non explosive rails at this moment are good in PvP, and Explosive Railways have always been pretty solid weapons.
---
See that’s why I made this post, I was reading up about the vaults and heard about the G.E.C.K and vault 101 so was excited when I heard it was in Fallout 76 and what created the mire :-( then I read it got closed but I wasn’t aware it was because of server performance! Do you think with how Wastelanders went and the state of the game now that the server could handle it now if they reopened it? I mean aren’t they putting A colossal problem inside a mine or something? So surely a vault shouldn’t be a problem post Wastelanders  :)
---
I neeeed to see the G.E.C.K Roooooom :-(
---
Sorry returning player...what is this? Can I get it? And how?
---
Yeah...i didn't know that but then Johnny tried to backstab me at the end so...
---
Johnny was never gonna survive that heist anyway.
---
That was pretty much the same for me, except I noped away from f76 when that bug came out that let players take anything off your inventory
---
Yup they exist and your mom can buy em on eBay, but you can vaporize the queen in secs with in game drops as well.
---
There was a mask but hasn’t been in the shop for awhile
---
Gold
---
I spent 6hrs yesterday going up and down on road 81 with no luck. I wonder if u need to be friendly with the settler for her to spawn.
---
I never saw it sadly :(
---
That’s what I’m hoping for with the Public teaming that it will encourage them to bring them back :-) I shudder to imagine what the raid was like with no text chat, randoms in a team... yikes
---
Hopefully it’ll be back soon
---
If you're going to search Huntersville and stuff make a Bloatfly syringer if you can get enough, or I can give you one if you want, that way any enemy you shoot with it will spawn a bloat fly
---
Edit: post was older than I realized lol but lmk if you want the syringer
---
Here’s hoping!
---
You can spawn your own bloatflies with a syringer modded with a bloatfly barrel...
---
You can turn on auto update for your Xbox games
---
while stability did improve, i still dont think its quite up high enough to release vault 94 back,  a good comparison would be nuke silos.   while you can get some great and smoothe runs, there is still plenty of lag related issues with it. (slow 15 mainframe core room, terminals taking years to load, pipes having like a 30 second repair delay)
---
said problems were much more noticeable in the raids, since almost every room had a similar mechanic to the above.  those server lag delays would kill runs fast as the timer ticks away.
---
if they got the silo's to run smoother than greased lightning like 90% of the time, i think most of the raid "problems" would be solved
---
Is officers not dropping a code piece a bug if yes then that is my answer
---
Dude, should’ve sold them. I’ve gotten 1000 caps for a thousand rounds of .44 and .38. Then I spend it all on 12 gauge rounds.
---
Just remember pa has a 42% damage reduction
---
Meeeeee!!
---
Damn, I still have one on display.
---
I locked back in after like 6 or 7 months away this weekend and it frankly all I can think about again. The wastelanders update seems to have made a world of difference from everything I’ve surmised and experienced in the last 96 hours.
---
No, the lifetime challenges are unchanged. It's only weekly and daily challenges that are being changed.
---
That's great news. I guess there's some misinformation spreading around.
---
Well not entirely great since dailies are already pretty low
---
Are you actually having an existential crisis over an irradiated appalachia? 
---
I think you may be overthinking things a tad.
---
I've started the Encrypted event just to stimpack people.
---
I've also paid players caps to let me stimpack them. 😂🤣
---
its a new system for 76 so they can give us (mostly) cosmetic items.  
---
it comes out in tomorrow's update, and all the rewards can be unlocked with playtime (estimated like 170 hrs iirc).    after 2 weeks you can pay atoms to advance faster if your into that
---
Not since the mod by my house is filled my old military gear and other assorted crap
---
Make one whole friend in game.
---
Not sure where it comes from.
---
Yeah, wasn't talking about you at all, my bad.   I'm not concerned about points at all either but this is the first time I have ever been down voted for something as simple as "rock in front of door" and you for saying "that sucks" basically.  Either there are some bots down voting everything or someone is really fricken bored lately lol.
---
How much do you sell it for?
---
Im also dubious of the stated time.
---
So they stated that the levels will be 1-2hrs to achieve. They stated that in addition to the daily/weekly challenges you can level up by doing events, earning xp, playing NW.
---
What we dont know is what weighting these hold - is it 1-2 hrs if you focus getting every challenge done? Or is it play for 1-2 hrs and you'll probably do some challenges by accident, and earn some xp, and that will level you up?
---
Because there's a vast difference between a lv 10 who wanders around  and a lv100 who's in a group with inspirational on, well rested and xp food boosts thats server hopping west tek. The XP difference is massive.
---
Same with people who hit up every public event, and the same with people who do every daily, not just the ones that happen to unlock.
---
Caps mostly because you can get like 1k caps from one present if you get the chance. but otherwise you get plans, food, booze and junk. all of which can be sold and most plans are considered rare since the presents can give you any plan already existing within the game files.
---
I know your pain.

---
No its free. Confirmed in a FAQ. Subsequent seasons will be free too
---
What even is RL ?
---
The point? Waste time, it's the Wasteland after all.
---
Obviously I'd join the enclave but isn't 5% a little low? I get that energy weapons are common but maybe something more effective like 25% would be better. Also besides vault 76, but they're a joke, they are the only faction to have two buffs. Maybe something like you can place an anti nuke cannon or something at your base that prevents it from getting nuked. Other than that 10/10.
---
Sure if you only have 1 character. It got so repetitive on my 4 guys, I just took a break
---
Don't forget the horribly sheltered kid in Foundation. He's a total bitch.
---
With the crafting station bug, just release the movement controls once you hit the exit button (basically don’t try to turn or move straight away) and you shouldn’t re-enter it
---
I'd be ok with such a thing, but again there is now no real point in wearing PA. I'd like to see if no buffs for PA, at least some decent perks that don't just affect fusion core strength and the durability. And then you have the knockdown one in strength, but it's pretty much worthless except for attacking low level enemies. So honestly I'd be fine with nothing else but getting some useful perks for PA rather than the trash ones that are currently offered.
---
Minecraft has hunger though. You also drop your shit when you die. Minecraft is more hardcore
---
That’s all i get lol
---
Thank you so very much! It's working like a charm now! It's still a little bit instable here and there but it's very playable now! :)
---
I was even able to up the graphics a little bit!
---
I like to believe my 3* deathclaw gauntlet @ 164 DMG is decent.

The micro management brought me into player vending which then encouraged me to build a better camp. My character, playstyle and hoarding changed completely this way.
---
If you aren't running your vending machines already you should start asap. It took some days of trial &amp; error and some research to get my prices right. But it helped me clear my stash, refine my build and then allowed me to buy some nice weapons from other players. I could dump my old weapons, clear quite some stash space &amp; reduce my carried weight. 
---
I'm kind of a hoarder too, and being able to sell the stuff you pick up was a game changer for me. 
---
Ofc setting up vendors again is a game of micro magement itself, though a rewarding one. Other than that you would have to change your habits completely, start being picky with your loot and leave quite a lot of good junk behind...
---
Yep, there's several active bugs with the vendors still. I took mine down and finally made my first mule just so I can keep playing until they fix them...
---
lol at those moral groupings, almost all of the factions are fucked up (in all fallout games) and grouping them like this, just whitewashes so much of the story telling done about each faction.
---
i really feel that karmatic designations have no purpose in stories as nuanced as fallout and have been a mistake every time they have been featured.
---
buffing stash will make everyone side with foundation
---
PvP elements are pointless as PvP is dead and broken.
---
despite what alot of people here are saying, the more i look at these bonuses the more i see how they dont really balance well, or end up just being moot or irreverent. some cool ideas, but also alot of ideas that would be just as out of touch if bethesda came up with them, and there are things to work out in every single aspect of this chart.
---
vault 76 doesnt really make sense as a faction, literally every player would be a member, and that to me defeats the purpose, and i think any noob focused mechanics should be handled by the responders, its kind of their thing anyway
---
foundation adding camp hit points is a pretty irrelevant benefit noone will care about, people would only join for the stash buff, which is way too much of a core mechanic to be buffed like that, and would also create issues with losing rep with the faction (and losing stash weight?) they need a buff that unlocked unique camp items, and have daily quests focused around fixing and rebuilding core infrastructure around Appalachia.  
---
i dont see how responders have anything to do with bounty hunting, the flare idea is ok but people would just farm that mechanic for the rewards and not actually do anything. 
---
the camp defense in the mire sounds ok, but only if its an event that can be ignored or only manually trigger-able, otherwise it will just be a chore that might fuck up my beautiful camp.
---
BoS should get a much higher damage buff, but only with laser guns rather than a buff against ghouls/muties
---
we already revive 90% of player vendor caps so OP is just confused about that part, and raising the daily vendor limit wont really be that appealing if the over all caps limit stays where it is. a better benefit would be to have access to a special importer NPC vendor that offers items from outside Appalachia 
---
enclave should get a plasma buff instead of all energy weapons seeing as plasma is sorta the enclaves thing. maybe also access to a daily orbital drop with unique loot
---
rose has different interests than any of the other raiders and shouldn't so top of the world should not be included. noone really wants to PvP so instead they should get free unique chems since they are all on drugs anyway.
---
mothman cult, again PvP is busted and making a whole mechanic around it isnt a good idea. instead you do a daily trial to earn the mothmans favor, (failure results in a sort of debuff, success results in access to the chest)
---
i also think that making you ally with only one faction lock you out of too much even though you can switch. i think that the factions need to be paired against the faction most apposed to them. we need shit to do, and i think having access too 4 of the 8 daily benefits is a good balance between choice and accessibility.
---
BoS V Enclave (as usual)
---
Resonders V Freestates (freestates being very isolationist and trusting, would be suscisious of the open nature of the responders)
---
Settler V Raiders
---
Blue Ridge Caravan V Mothman cult. (lunatics are not good for business, and the failure of the company to import lamps enrages his holy mothman)
---
very cool post OP, but i really think it needs a ton of work.
---
I just can't understand why they won't let 3\* enemies drop 3\* stuff.  Pretty defeating when you dump thousands of rounds in SBQ for a 1\* drop.  They should drop whatever level star they are, every time!  The rng is already insane in this game.
---
Rebel Scum
---
Well remember, they approached the game all wrong and had their "B Team" work on it who had a lot less experience making a Fallout title. I'd also like to point out that this is Bethesda's second attempt at an online game throughout their history. Not to mention Zenimax, the company that bought out Bethesda, only owns and operate game companies that have made solo player games. So you have to give them credit where credit is properly due. They used a game engine that is 15+ years old and the wrong server type that makes it hard to support large maps, but they were forced to choose this type of server because of the CAMP system, which lets players designate areas as their own, which I kinda like and hope this system makes it into other Fallout games.
---
That stupid board game thingy they call Seasons.
---
Agreed. 2.2k hours with the vast majority of that solo, and I've been annoyed each week they have group challenges. Those missed atoms!
---
Every single time I've tried playing with others they are either squeaker-streamer-want-to-be's, cheaters/exploiters, or just straight out annoying. I've put in way too much time and money into this game to be forced to group with people that are going to make it not fun. 
---
Or use exploits on my private server after my power went out. ❌❌❌😒
---
Gotcha, I’ll give that a try. I knew I was repeatedly doing something I probably shouldn’t.
---
What about the second hand smoke!? Raiders smoke like chimneys! Don’t even get me started on the asbestos, it’s in my camp my armor...
---
Vault 96 is still getting some work done on it
---
I have locks on all my doors, for when I need to shut down vending when I'm at max. Always lovely when I come home and all my doors are shut, leaving vending inaccessible to buyers🤦‍♂️need a different strategy I guess
---
Very well said
---
You still repair the pipes? Weird. I just pick the lock on the door.
---
That's a neat idea too. Have a designated area like a workshop. Teams can build defenses and barriers and resource extractors. Whatever survives the onslaught is the factions to keep for say a week and they get those materials / resources deposited daily. Imagine radioactive greenhouses to grow nuked flora as one of the resources. You know. Endgame stuff...
---
This could be something they do with the Legendary Perks system that was suppossed to be coming out for patch 20, but has been pushed back (because of pretty much universal condemnation about how crap they were)
---
i still run the whole thing, the longer i take the more robots spawn for those damn "kill robot with X" challenges
---
The lag when going through my stash/vendors/crafting chems etc is maddening not sure if this is a bug really; but it’s what makes me the most upset.
---
You can always report the ones that are broken for you and they'll add atoms for these challenges to your account. Done that several times, they always replied the same way: they are aware about the challenges' issues and while they don't have fix for said challenges atm I can just have the atoms instead.
---
I'd be happy if class freak worked on speed demon.
---
How would it handle the stash  weight when you switch?
---
yeah If bethesda were actually going to look at this I might have spent more time on balance and ignored the good/evil alignments haha.
---
It happens to be too. I figured after a day of getting covered in ghoul blood and deathclaw goo the ripe smell of your character is just sensory overload for those poor bots !
---
It would be hard to do without mass-nerf what’s currently in game first, since a good roll three star can already kill everything fast in the wasteland. Or they need to introduce a bunch of new creatures that put ‘god roll’ three stars to the test, naturally there will be demand for more power. Without changing what’s currently in game, there’s not so much need for more powerful gears.
---
I would have done that but earphones weren’t charged
---
Honestly I hate those things. They creep me the fuck out. Their shuffling and heavy breathing and the obnoxious sounds they make when attacking.
---
Take vending down for now. Its not worth it imo
---
I love this idea. Also got a good chuckle out of the bright lights buff
---
Considering they went from being really expensive to now being $5 a pop and so many people having them, it’s no surprise the average Joe has one. It’s sad, really. The hacked .50 used to go for $500 and now everyone and their mother has one
---
Wait the geck created the mire?
---
It's a survival game, but people complained enough about eating/drinking that they've decided to remove it. Maybe complaining about low stash space will get similar results.
---
I got a Bloodied 10mm smg with faster fire rate but level 40. Still a good weapon I imagine.
---
So why comment lol
---
Apocalypse or not, I wanna look best caps could buy it, damn it ! :D
---
Yep. I have the mask. Looks good with the black Prospector's hat and the long, black scavenger coat. Very medieval! I'm going to wear until COVID is over!
---
Ya but that’s not what I’m talking about
---
Lol f'n rights
---
But that necktie on Silver Shroud is sexy tho
---
Agree, I price stuff to move quickly.  1c all ammo, legendary various but rarely more than 999
---
Stumbled across a plan (PC) for sale tonight, never seen one in a vendor before. Was 12k. I might have bought it if it was 9k max, since selling them will repay in some days.
---
Fixer itself is quite affordable this days, bought a 30 for 500 and a 50 for 650.
---
....? You're hysterical man!
---
This^

I was about to write something close to this myself.

 [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Vault\_94\_G.E.C.K.\_recording](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Vault_94_G.E.C.K._recording)   
---
Basically a group of Free Staters shot the damn GECK with a minigun. This breached it, flooding 94 with radiation and reacting particularly poorly with the seed banks and other things in the Vault.  
---
Bad scene, great story.
---
I think I’ve gone insane from god Howard’s blessings
---
And why is this?please do explain furture
---
I always close them and they're vendor areas become locked
---
Thank you!
---
Humans are clever, devious little bastards with a huge amount of will to live, as a species.
---
It'll be hard, yes, but they have made it this far.
---
I imagine eventually they wont just trudge around in the rain hammering walls, but will actually start to build bigger, better vaults, where the earth will shield them more from the radiation.
---
Bethesda really should just remove the minimum damage on the queen. It needs to be tag and get loot like every other creature. Not do a minimum number of damage and hope the queen don’t glitch out. Its not like she gives out anything good half time.
---
The d u p e r s have duped them and I’m preparing for the rages of the people who brought one at full price
---
Ya, I have a habit of closing doors. That’s how I get locked in people’s camps.
---
Good legendary effects can turn them into beasts. My raider uses a bolt pipe, antiarmor explosive. 
---
With all perks on, he is unstoppable. 
---
A bloodied 38 turned auto can shred through anything. And ammo is free.
---
yeah, and based off they way they did the story for wastelanders, they definitely are going to go with the more accessible, non lockout approach too future content so i dont think we really would get a system like this.
---
I like these ideas but honestly I fear it's just too late. They are going to shift into full casual mode, the last bastion of a game desperate to grow no matter how much we suggest better alternatives.
---
I usually take advantage of people using the single window brick windows cuz you can waltz right through them. I dont know if that's a common fact or not..
---
Man lol you are 100% right...I am not going to lie every now and again I’ll be like OMG I can’t believe I have to go get some water...but seriously I probably grill a stack of steak once per 6 hrs of gameplay
---
Typical lames. But across all platforms?
---
But it won't cost you that. That's what we're trying to explain. You play the game and progress. If you play enough it costs nothing. Even if you don't play enough, you don't \*have to\* buy anything.
---
Mostly PC but Xbox and PS4 have also been hit by it just not as bad
---
Your neck will fall apart soon! Hah.
---
Haha haha lol I love that🤣🤣
---
Say what? Please explain how to get 30k XP from placing a blueprint #curious
---
It was pretty neat.  
---
One of the exterior halls surrounding the GECK chamber had collapsed completely, exposing ground water, roots and soil that probably would put it near the Red Rocket Mega-Stop.  
---
It's likely how the bugs and mirelurks got in there in the first place.
---
That would make more sense because they can shoot their beam until I'm dead or at least pretty damn crispy.
---
Which is why I would join the Responders.  I prefer defense and support.
---
Didn't like him personally
---
You know some small group is enraged somewhere as they are trying to figure out who leaked the means to do this, and have ruined their $$$ (and I mean $, not cap) making scheme.
---
How can it be ‘just not as bad’? It’s either yes or no, it’s not like dupers would go ‘yea it’s on console so let’s dupe fewer’.
---
Completely false! 😂
---
The continuous sound bug from machine guns will still be here.
---
Okay yes then is that better ?
---
Console?   I remember having that issues on PS4.
---
People have been asking for that type of feature for the excavator since the armor came out, still nothing. Definitely a bummer.
---
Probably lucky that the new patch will be out soon so that maybe this will stop idk
---
strictly for the downvotes..
---
Nuclear Winter lag.
---
When can we buy them dirt cheap like crashed santa plans?
---
I have a problem with my gauss rifle where I can’t reload until I use all 5 shots
---
Yea I need more mule storage *coughs* I mean character slots so I can enjoy rping another build besides bloodied low health also
---
I’m on PS4, I’d love to make a deal and dump it all, I’ve had a few buyers lined up over the last few months but no one actually came by to buy it.    If you’re also looking for a new weapon I have a 3* vampire/ffr mini gun that im looking to trade. I can’t remember the third perk though.
---
Depends if they keep going with the duping or not
---
It might work better if rather than raising the cap, it reduced the budget cost of specific items, like plants and the planter floors.
---
That way, other factions could have similar benefits for specific items. BoS or Enclave could have reduced stash weight for energy/heavy weapons and ammo. Responders could have reduced weights aid items (so players could build a stockpile of stims/radshields/etc). Raiders could have reduced costs for the ammo machine and any stored ballistic ammo.
---
Haha lol🤣
---
When both Fallout and Warzone update the same day
---
This game is wildly unpopular everywhere outside of this subreddit. I like this game for what it is, but it’s not a good fallout game. If you disagree with me, whatever, but I don’t have a death wish for fallout 76 just because I can see that Bethesda has a terrible history with player feedback and micro-transactions, and an even worse history with bugs. The team behind fallout 76 works hard, that’s undeniable, but this game isn’t... like, fantastic.
---
Apparently they don’t know when to stop lol
---
Litty. Thanks my man. I’ve been trying to play catch up the last 96 hours but it’s like I’m playing a totally different game.
---
I love my pipe revolvers and bolt actions. A focused build is a lot of fun, and cheap! Getting loot at Scorched Earth is not a problem. However, in the interest of DPS and the desire to help more I added some railway rifles (automatic, of course) to the build. High AP from all those Agility points and the low VATS cost of the RR makes for good times, and I think it still fits in with the "low tech" idea for the build.
---
They will never stop until bugthesda says fuck it and doesn’t bother stopping them anymore
---
cant wait for an enclave update
---
Licensing probably would make it impossible (they've had to remove radio songs already) but there's plenty of royalty-free music they could probably get. Even if it's not individual songs, some variation would be nice. At least give us Biv's jukebox!
---
That might not make too much sense, cause theres not really a way for it to drain the fusion cells u have. The assaultron is a Robot who is connected to a power source, hence why it can fire continuous. I think they should just increase the mag size of the head and based on your charge it will effect how long it fires
---
I would have thought something totally to unique to F76 would be looked after. It totally doesn't affect game balance at all either. Meanwhile I'll keep running a random perception mod....
---
This would be funny asf tbh
---
Course I’m getting downvoted for spreading the news jeez
---
That’s fair. After looking at the other replies, I’m probably going to rewrite it to include more specifics of the game mechanics. Probably should’ve kept this one in the drafts until I’d asked someone else’s opinion
---
Does anyone know if they’ll be patching the Vault 79 glitch tomorrow?
---
You know that’s utter bs. They dupe for their own gains, especially financially, it has nothing to do what company.
---
I don't get it
---
Yea. PS4.
---
Yep
---
I would never price ammo at anything higher then 1 cap, I wish I could bulk it for sale and put it cheaper. It’s my ocd that makes me pick it all up, if it were only a few hundred rounds I would just drop it at a train station but I can’t bring myself to drop that much just knowing that I can possible sell it all.
---
What I should do is go on the market and try to trade my 3* vampire/FFR/can’t remember the last perk mini gun and my 25k rounds of 5mm for a decent fixer.
---
Trophies are fine, I have platinum.
---
true
---
Yes I know I was making a joke jeezus
---
You still on?
---
You're welcome.  
---
Vault 94 was actually really intriguing, and tragic, lorewise.  
---
A Vault-Tec experiment to see how long it would take a group of religious pacifists to turn to violence once the Vault was opened. They were unarmed, didn't even realize they had an Overseer, and sadly didn't last long enough to really test the experiment because of how manic those Free Staters had become.  
---
Whenever you encounter a Vault 94 Ambassador in the wild (usually just a dead Vault Dweller, though some you can actually see the 94 on) take a moment to consider just how woefully unprepared they were for all this.
---
What I want to know is why do I keep seeing Junkies short gatlings everywhere. I have one, I go to a vendor and they have one, go to a different vendor and they have one. I know the crap weapons get scripted, but the variety of some things seems odd.
---
Pretty accurate depiction.
---
From my testing the Railway has a bug where you ignore 100% if not most of your target's armor
---
Yup! Pretty crazy ! Just when you think everyone was made by the bombs ;-)
---
There’s definitely ways to incorporate things beyond pipe guns and still be able to call myself a white trash genius or whatever but I just like the look of the pipe guns and the rustic feel of being in Appalachia and using ratty materials most frequently just appeals to me.
---
Oh yeah, people always make mistakes with copy/pasting!
---
Hopefully the could do it via code e.g. set spoil_rate = spoil_rate*0.8 but who knows...
---
I'd just be happy for you all, if they change it any way.
---
The recipe for Tick Blood Tequila should have unlocked for you when it was given. Depending on which type he gave you, sometimes you dont actually have to craft it to count. You can just give him one already crafted. Do you still have the quest active/actionable?
---
Better get out of sight
---
Nice one bro have u done it recently
---
Been thinking it would be pretty awesome if the brotherhood was there all along and never really left Appalachia :D
---
First off, this sounds amazing.   2nd i think I'd struggle with doing this for way too long and give up.  I'm going to try it
---
So the geck produced the exact same creatures we see 200 years after the bombs dropped with no changes
---
As a lot of people was complaining about it when it first dropped so I shelfed it but fancy picking it up soon and doing it
---
I know this thread is a few days old, but about that magic health regen of having lifegiver 3 at 20% and speed demon, how does the health gen proc? I'm trying and it's not regenerating for me. Thanks!
---
For the love of all that is Atom I would love to even just be able to explore them every once in awhile.. Even though I'd much prefer some substance to them, something is better than nothing, especially since they're already there to begin with.
---
It's just a rumor, as far as I know people are just hoping it gets removed.
---
It is with leather shoulder straps
---
right on, hope to see ya out in the wasteland soon!
---
Chems and food and alcohol, that's how you put out the real big numbers. 
---
But, make sure you have a piece of armour with AP refresh and ditch AP boy. AP armour combined with lone wanderer at 4 and grim reaper at 3 will give you plenty of AP, oh and eat some honey.
---
Humans are like roaches but unlike roaches we have a lot of skills in destroying. We are a physical virus, a plague on this planet. Bugs help the environment by removing garbage. Humans don't have a place in the natural order in the world. We just manipulate the environment for our own needs by mostly destroying and consume whatever we create from manipulating the environment.
---
I’ve gotten platinum I received mine last year in December.
---
Nuke whitesprings and put green thumb on and go nuts... farm the ghouls first for the high rad fluids glowing mass and hardened mass
---
I believe 15% blocking on an armour piece also causes the 'magic' effect.
---
The way I understand it, it isn't directly related to your budget, but rather it can only happen while your CAMP is still in the process of loading in on that player's screen. Higher budget CAMPs obviously take longer to load, ergo the higher your budget is, the more vulnerable you are. Your best defense (besides removing your vendor altogether) is making sure your fast travel spawn point is as far as possible from your vendor. Note that other players have a different spawn point from yourself; they will spawn wherever you spawn when first loading into the server at your CAMP, not where you spawn when fast traveling to your CAMP from other locations.
---
hydraulics can be run off a motor other than the vehicles drivetrain...
---
Play skyrim
---
I love my IE automatic Pipe Pistol. It will take out any enemy that's not a bullet sponge.
---
Seriously, it really is. If you start feeling burned out, take some time and play the sightseeing game! Walk around Appalachia and take pictures of all the cool stuff you come across 👍🏾
---
I actually find myself stopping randomly to take in the scenery and sometimes snap a screenshot for a loading screen
---
Your guns just up and fly away !
---
Now I know some of the challenges are still bugged.  I thought they fixed them but nope. The ones I have still don’t work.  But it is what it is with them.  Lol.
---
By the time you find the ingredients for the recipes, the first ones have usually spoiled, too.
---
I think this happens when someone kills mobs with laser/plasma weapons and they turn in to ash/goo. It's really annoying.
---
So, no.
---
As long as I can get platinum on it I'll be happy hate putting hours into a game to not get it breaks me
---
WhAt'S tHe DeAl WiTh BrEaDWrApPeRs???
---
?
---
You don't need atoms to rank, you earn SCORE through various means while playing the game, including just gaining XP, public events, and challenges. 
---
The ability to pay for SCORE levels begins 2 weeks into the season and is completely optional.
---
I did find a normal Marksman Sniper that I'm using that does 10 points more of damage. haven't used it long enough to know if it's better than that one.  
---
I could craft one as well but I don't have the mats. I made a mistake and didn't get Starched Genes and max it asap. I was lucky in getting Marsupial and had half my HP bar lost to rads. Leveling twice while avoiding Rads was not easy. I'm good now. I do appreciate the offer. I hope you helped a few people as best you can.
---
I made a ghetto cabin out of wood just because what was the point with that uglyass ceiling.
---
As has already been stated, always... ***ALWAYS*** put on a HAZMAT suit or CSA under your power armor. It's a habit for me at this point.
---
I believe they were bugged for people with carry over BETA characters. If you start over fresh you should be fine. I shelved my BETA character and started over new. Got the platinum last December.
---
I dont get it please explain it to me
---
Do you happen to know the stats on them?
---
yeah
---
I hate the giant gap with regular floors. I just put down a bunch of rugs.
---
They can’t hear you unless they have the area mic setting on. He probably thought I was messing with him
---
You could say that they tie the room together...
---
Working with a semi-RP faction was what got me into PvP
---
Remember when plasma grenade plans were worth something?
---
Now I see 20 plans or more in vendors for like 100 caps.
---
I will pay to skip that one
---
that’s a good idea... how do you mule your stuff? do u have a friend who helps you or something?
---
I usually just sell meds periodically to keep the count down. For mods I never usually knew which ones were good so I just scrap them.
---
The answer to every "Can we get X?" question is always the same as "Can Bethesda make profit of X?"...
---
Yeah I wore this for a long time until I got my Mr. Fuzzy Outfit.
---
Yeah, started playing at release..finally got round to getting platinum (not wastelanders though) about 4 weeks ago.
---
They should just change it to 
---
"Complete events"
---
I believe it's still active and I need to craft it...
---
I'm level 107 now so I'm sure I can do it now. The mats seemed confusing or hard to find because I don't know much about flux but I guess if I want more booze it's time to stop being a noob.
---
They could do that, but then they would have to make three stars that much more rare. At the end of the day, does it really matter?
---
no stash limits
---
no hunger
---
no thirst
---
no currency limits
---
no weight limits

no weapon damage

anything I miss?
---
On my first run through I killed him cause I didn't think there was an alternative. The next time did the speech check just to see if he can survive - which he can but he's a db.
---
oh they found a way to trade them, that's why they're duping them after all. Reason why I said dupers will find a way.
---
The only door I ever close at my camp is the bedroom door when I'm sleeping.
---
Once I saw some guy pop in on my screen while I was laying there, and I listened and he just...never closed the door on the way out. I want him arrested.
---
It’s not a “pass”. And it’s free for everyone. So yes, seasons are free for 1st and non-first members.
---
yup, they stack Psychobuff constantly (in the Godmode, you can stack bobbleheads, chems, alcohol, and even armor continuously by clicking the armor over and over). This means they waltz on over with a LMG, PLasma gatling, or any other rapid fire weapon that does over 10,000 damage, some folks go nuts and shove it to 30,000 and just instantly pop the queen.
---
Or heck, just the stair floor piece that was in FO4... with the stair in the middle but the floor around it more.   Make a foundation one and a upper floor one.
---
What premium part?
---
That and nice interior walls is on the list of things people have been after forever. It's a long list.
---
High lvls have no use for normal ammo. And having that slow ammo factory only gives annoying defence quests.
---
It has been happening to the plasma cores in my Gatling Plasmas since Wastelanders downloaded.  sometimes it won't even get a shot off before it yanks a full core and puts another in.
---
I’m tagging Bethesda community managers in this. This is honestly too well put together for them to not appreciate it, even if it doesn’t get implemented 
---
u/BethesdaGameStudios_
---
u/LadyDevann
---
sadly I dont think ladders are part of the engine
---
Pretty much any game with a battle pass works this way. It’ll cost a lot of money to buy your way to the top if you want to do so, or you can just play a lot and level up for free
---
They migrated.
---
Isn’t it just great those game assets just casually sitting there on your Hard drive, all downloaded and not even being able to access them 🙃
---
PA has extra hidden res and you can stms without animation and stabilized perk.
---
Too much? Too soon? Sorry...
---
I'm ready, my expectations are non existent, so I shouldn't be disappointed.
---
Yeah, I wish. I’m at that point where basically all I do is events. I have one friend who plays with me occasionally, he’s only a level 7, so when I can get him to play with me while this challenge is open I drag him to things like Line in the Sand lol. 
---
Definitely curious to see how Seasons is going to work for us solo players, and the Public team finder.
---
That makes sense thank you
---
Anything adding pvp wont really work, with the bugs of hit detection or dysycn, plus the thousand damage per hit builds. It would have to be a whole diffrent server, like survival.
---
I imagine its because things are hot until the servers actually come down to be updated. If they release the notes early theres always a chance something doesnt make it in and then they have 50 posts asking why x in the patch notes is a lie!!!!!!!!!
---
It might work for unique named weapons or armors from specific quests or world bosses. Could get ugly quick if they where randomized.
---
You see THIS is what I need! Story! Lore! Things that connect the dots! Not another yellow icon on my map I can’t access :-(
---
I'm mostly still using it until I can get the ammo printer thing from the raiders.
---
Legendary perks were delayed. Lots of info about them in the forums but they are being reworked. 
---
I don’t think there is any indication when future patches will come specifically. The roadmap is an outline. There is zero chance everything will happen exactly as it’s mapped out.
---
Good questions... that makes sense I think.
---
As for me personally, I have the damage display option turned on in the setting. I am using a Handmade TSE and I hit on average 8 damage each hit with my build (depends on distance, body part etc) - I can see the damage number appear on the target with each hit.
---
Lately, I've expended at little as 250 rounds per fight - 10 full clips within at least two "landings" (some fights I've expended 6,000 - but let's leave those aside), so assuming I hit with 50% of my bullets overall... 1000 damage.
---
I get that all this "math" is very imperfect, just an educated guess.
---
I have been under the impression that there was/has been a "hard minimum" you had to hit to qualify for loot. But what you say makes sense, perhaps the trigger depends on how the damage is distributed, so whenever there is a god/magic weapon meta build does 80% of the overall damage... he/she is screwing all of us... that has been going on for most of my fight in the past 2 months or so.
---
Scrap everything
---
Sell stuff 
---
Play the game
---
? Reloading is 1 tap. Just get better
---
Sounds good
---
And we could meet the protectron she owns and that has no concept of personal boundaries.
---
I hear you on the daily/weekly atom thing going away. And while I'm not promising anything, and while I don't think it's going to be enough to make everyone happy, I think there's still going to be opportunities to get atoms on top of the 1500 or so in the SCORE rewards including several new Character/Social/World/Etc challenges that run the gamut from easy to hard to quick to time consuming (Cure 7 Addictions/Kill 76 Glowing Creatures/Nuke 10 Cities, et cetera). Like I said, it probably won't be enough to make up for differences introduced in the new system, and again I'm not promising anything, but I think there's still going to be opportunities to get more atoms than just what you see in the SCORE rewards.
---
I rename in brachets to get them at the bottom to prevent selling. Scripting or scrapping
---
Hey guys, let’s downvote the shit outta this so we get as many “servers down” posts as possible tomorrow. We could easily break whatever the record is
---
Ha wait till you find out the story behind squirrel bits and how far back in the fallout games the story started and then goes all the way to post Vault 111 
---
Oxhorn has some amazing lore videos that really make you appreciate the lore masters in the fallout Universe !
---
Thank you guys
---
2H= Instigating Grognak's Axe with FSS.  1H=Vampires Bowie Knife with FSS.
---
I think the comic is trying to say that the only people who dislike the state of the game are the PVP players? I don’t agree with the message if that’s the case though.
---
Join in on a scorchbeast queen event. The event itself awards Flux of a few different types regardless of if you do enough damage on the queen to be able to loot her. Take plenty of stims and the best weapon and armor you have and you should do alright anyway if theres a bunch of players. Most times now the fight takes place outside of the nuke zone so no need to worry too much about rad protection. Theyre pretty exhilarating. Hopefully you get the type of flux you need that way. Otherwise its a lengthier process of killing enemies in nuke zones to obtain the 3 different ingredients needed as well as collecting the nuked flora of whatever type is required. The other way si to buy it from a player vendor but not often youll find it and it will be expensive.
---
I've heard shielded has DR/ER/RR of 15/15/15 and 4 Strength, 2 Perception, 4 Endurance. I hope that's right!
---
Im pretty sure it  can be bought at a vendor bot
---
Generally speaking, Anti-Armor is only worth it against specific set of enemies in this game. Take a ghoul for example. They have 10 DR, which means with your legendary that becomes 5 DR. So it really depends on what kind of weapon you're using. If you're sniper does 50 points of damage against this ghoul. So if you were using this same rifle without the legendary affix, then you would deal 47 damage. With the affix, you deal 49 damage. If you were to just use your 10 more damage rifle, then your final damage would be 54.
---
So yeah anti armor is heavily dependent on what you're fighting. It can be decent against a high armor enemy. But a lot of times the extra 10 damage is more beneficial. Like against a super mutant warlord. Using anti armor would only give you about a 11% damage in crease if the weapon does a base of 50 damage. So you deal 5 more damage.
---
I have I think all of the mods unlocked for the rifle, so let me know if you want me to mod it out. 50. cal hardened receiver, scopes, suppressor, etc.
---
If you reallllly want to min/max ( I wouldn't recommend it. This game isn't that hard to really justify it, but you do you), then the following affixes are the best. Bloodied, Junkies, Furious (depends on weapon), Instigating (depends on weapon/enemy), and I think Berserker is decent. But right now bloodied/junkies is meta
---
Its fine how it is. Get an SSD.
---
Just pay to pass the team one's I know many people don't like paying but if it benefits you in the end go for it. I know that they could just make it to where there are no social challenges, that's a double edged sword for people that like to be social... If they get no benefit for teaming up. Then the team system will fail. It's being put in the game for a reason... To get you and people like you out of your shell. Not everyone's a squeaker-streamer-wannabe, not everyone's a scammer, and not everyone is out to hurt your play session. Continuing to believe this will only destroy the game for you... And others that fallow in your path.
---
Just team up for like 30 mins do the thing and leave the team, but don't go flooding the reddit with post like this. You can mute team members, you don't have to join a chat or a party with them, you can be completely anti social while still doing the social tasks.
---
This would be great. The use the same mods, but the fixer doesn't have a mod slot for paint. I think that is the problem actually.
---
Definite no that second part. I can only see the bugs and connection errors that would come with it.
---
Ouch a lvl 7 doing line in the sand how dose that go?
---
But they can at least cap it higher.
---
Oh I know about squirrel bits thats fucked
---
Okay, thanks.
---
Back in January I found 200 Xmas Presents in a suitcase outside The Whitespring next to a cigarette machine full of junk-tier legendaries and taxidermy plans. I rolled the dice and opened 175 of them and I'm still here.
---
IGN?
---
Nothing it's a regional joke that 1/10000000 people will get
---
It's not really hard to manage weight in the game but Fallout 3 forward just introduced unlimited storage at your base so that you could save things and play with them later.
---
The original games (edit: can't include the weird ass console one hardly anyone has played...idk there) made you choose if you wanted to carry Jimmy Hats or not.
---
I'm at lvl 300 and still haven't gotten my damn achievement for reaching lvl 100 lmao
---
The data mining guys have noticed that some of the code in 96 have been played around and worked on so here is hoping it opens soon.
---
My team and I ran 94 on private servers all the time with no problem. If you take the time to do the research and practice then vault 94 was pretty easy. The only thing I would like changed from vault 94 is when the chick would talk, the timer would also be running so we would be stuck at doors, waiting for her to finish talking so we could open the door but the whole time the timer would also be counting down.
---
A raid for a whole *four* players and the servers can't handle it.  
---
In a way, that's almost impressive.
---
No, that's Bethesda's fault. You don't leave a hole and expect a Fallout player to not crawl into it.
---
What ammo do you need? And on PC?
---
Yeah it's the only one that's slightly slutty love seeing people wearing it
---
I'm interested - I bought the game in May, and just finished all the quests besides Beckett and launching my own nuke. It was starting to feel like nothing else to do, but these nasty PVP encounters make me think there's farther to go.
---
No worries I apparently had my notifications off.  Add me and I will bounce to my private server as soon as I finish this dumb quest checkpoint
---
Today is the last day I try to do challenges
---
This would be assuming stuff like that was worked out in pts, but if there was no limit people would just use it as an extra 50 (or however many) stash space, there needs to be a reason not to, but I'm absolutely open to anything that accomplishes that
---
SBQ should never fly..
---
It is a good bundle, but personally I'd wait until tomorrow for the new update, all the new bundles will be in the atomic store and if you don't like any of the new ones your still able to buy the mothman one
---
Right now, no I think it’s fine 
---
If legendary perks get added, like the flat 30% damage reduction for non Pa armor sets, then Pa will absolutey need a buff or I will never wear power armor again on my heavy guy
---
I was stocking up on 5.56 ammo, but now I'm printing .308 for the light machine gun build I'm working towards.
---
Also, yes, PC.
---
Jeeps get such bad gas mileage it would be more like double fast travel cost 😂
---
Your own....
---
I don't and not sure why you'd assume that.
---
Do those mole miners even exist? I spent an hour running circles around that stupid heap.
---
Griefer! Now that's living life on the edge! 🤙
---
They are usually a reward from Scorched Earth too
---
Its probably the last item on my list of previously released things Im waiting on returning. Hopefully it comes back soon
---
What I’m doing right now. My Fallout1st just renewed so I have so atoms to spend tomorrow
---
If you have fo1st, you can use the private server to transfer stuff to your mule pretty reliably.
---
I believe in you
---
Well, you could argue that the role of humans is to destroy the life on earth (including that of humans) so that everything can reset. Nothing humans can do will permanently damage the planet. The planet will ultimately recover and new life will form.
---
So, humans do have a place - we are the 'reset button'.
---
Same here, mine renewed this morning. I was going to buy the raider bundle with the gold handmade skin but then I realized if a new bundle comes out tomorrow to go with update 20 (brotherhood bundle maybe) I would be short a lot of atoms
---
I am really liking seeing all the creative ways people are using the counter/bar pieces from the Red Rocket set in their camps. I love it when people use imagination. Makes up for my lack of it
---
Xbox also, and I normally sell them between 1500-2000.
---
It's the same with me.
---
Trust me, I loved Vault 94 for this shit.
---
Hell, the better I got at it the more I loved it because the hidden things became clearer and more tragic.
---
I mean, some of the things are really clear when you get in there; the bones in lab coats, twisted by roots, or the one guy hanging from the ceiling with a weed trimmer.

But when you consider that we have to protect the bots in the Engineering Wing because Vault-Tec made sure they wouldn't be produced with weapons, as that might queer the experiment, it gets interesting.
---
The named ghouls in the GECK chamber being the Free Staters who shot the blasted thing, the Council recordings, the door guard really looking forward to using his "Weapons Check" for once, and how genuinely these people wanted to open their doors to the outside world and aid survivors; Vault 94 was a hell of a trip and I really hope someday they open it back up.

I know what you mean. I feel like there's a lot of inconsitency in quality across the board. Some of the sound design is far overdone(the chittering bugs in the forest), to the point of being irritating, while some of it is so underdone it's irritating(the lack of variety in dialog/music from NPCs). I'm constantly asking myself while I'm playing the game if Bethesda even plays their own game to test it.

I use my 1st private world, if you'd rather use caps than real money 500-1000 should buy you the services of a reputable courier/trader.
---
Excess scrap can be ‘bulked’ at a tinkers bench and sold to vendors. Ymmv but not scrapping everything and selling the junk might net some more caps at a cost of weight while adventuring. There are some scrap items that can be sold directly such as gold, silver, asbestos. If it cant be bulked, it can be sold. 
---
Also be aware of picked up/earned mods - they get dumped in your stash when you deposit all junk and take up a ton of room if you forget them. Most of them are trash and should be sold.
---
Hmm. I never paid attention to all the challenges until today. Mainly because I heard some misinformation spreading. I took care of it though, but never realized this until now lol.

She lands much more frequently when people arent blasting her with quad heavy weapons for 5 min at a time

Bethesda:*Hippity hoppity your ideas are now my licensed property*
---
Thanks!  I wanted one but don't have the ATOM shop one so I started playing around.
---
I was wondering how all this was happening when I heard about it. So pretty much the solution (if there can even be one) is to fix the god mode glitch, which enables all of this and the duping etc.
---
Hah! Thanks
---
It's been glitched since the game released
---
Sofia's only gonna open it again at mine so don't bother. 
---
Or Athena.... 'The amount of dirt is endless.... Endless....'
---
Or a trader....

I have a locked inner apartment to escape these clowns. My workshop needs to be accessible for my customer base though! They need to be able to scrap, stash and repair.
---
That’s the problem. This is barely an RPG as it is, and definitely not MO with its tiny server-player capacity. I think what the misconception is that difficulty does not always have to correlate to grindiness. The faction rep was a good example of Bethesda being desperate to increase the grind of the game, forcing players to log in daily, rather than increasing difficulty by adding more, end-game challenges and enemies. Vault 94 was a step in the right direction, if poorly implemented. If you have a challenge that requires a massive amount of ammunition and supplies to overcome, suddenly the tedium of farming rep doesn’t feel as bad, because the rewards for doing so are given a direction and purpose.
---
It's been bugged since launch for me. You can solo kill the queen and it won't count.
---
It’s glitched for everyone. I heard tell of the theory that the only way to get it is to be the last lucky sob to put a bullet in her. Others disagree.
---
Looking forawrd to public teams for faster leveling
---
Would love to play https://youtu.be/rE7S4nLrThs at C.A.M.P don't know how to rename it sorry
---
Wait what? I've never had anything drop from a legendary and not match up with the stars. 3 starred enemies ALWAYS drop 3 star gear in my case, same with 1 and 2 stars. Weird.
---
I’ve been trying to find articles and post from the Datamining community but I’ve had no luck :/ but that’s great to hear! It has so much potential from what I’ve read with good intentions too, but I think a bit of community feedback like with the Colossus on PTS and they should be right to bring it back :-)
---
I'm fully expecting vending machines being disabled within hours of the update tomorrow, because you **know** something will be borked.
---
When I found out I just... 🤢🤢🤢
---
I love the basic notions behind this, absolutely.
---
Lmfao, so you think they got what they deserved because they don't let in men, that is pretty pathetic. Kinda makes you ponder WHY they don't let in men, men like yourself... hahaha. Maybe they wanted to avoid the pettiness and entitlement that you're portraying here.
---
That... actually makes a lot more sense lol! I have them all favourited since I don’t use the quick function wheel but I might try the brackets idea! Thanks man!
---
My purveyor drops have all been trashé for the past week. All mutant tire irons and assassins laser pistols. So yeah.
---
I climb in through you windows and glitch into your home to admire all the awesome work you put in! I bet your place looks amazing! I like to leave donuts on the floor of locked camps, hopefully I find yours one day ❤️
---
Wow man, that sounds exactly what the game needs for the new players that came from wasterlanders once they finish the main stories! Thankyou for sharing that !
