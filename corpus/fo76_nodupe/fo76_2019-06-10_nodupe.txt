I am so lost as to where this is...Cant even find the shack.
---
---
---
very sad indeed
---
If the leaks are true, we are going to have NPCs in F76! Oh, and BR.
---
Nice I'm a Xbox player so I've yet to use mods but those two would definitely be at the top
---
Please... we need perk decks.
---
Boooooo
---
Jug really dose a lot of creative house stuff for 76
---
That would be pretty awesome. Not to be a Debbie Downer, but doesn‚Äôt the storyline of NV take place years after 76? (been awhile, so I don‚Äôt really remember) But if so, that may be why we don‚Äôt have it :(
---
I usually test every location before I start building and people still fast travel inside walls. I think Bethesda need to think of a system that calculates the loading time and shows longer loading screens accordingly. That way people will appear after the location is loaded fully.
---
The behemoth lake thats south of The Vantage/Solomon Pond?
---
I'm not sure, I believe I saw you at WS Trainstation while I was selling some stuff to the vendor. I just remember telling my wife how appropriately named you were and she laughed and rolled her eyes lol.
---

---
Nice to see you having fun your way!
---
I also do that! People really appreciate the message and most of the times explain me how long it took them to build it.
---
I agree that there should be other priorities, but I am sure they will be working on a lot of stuff simultaneously. Man, I have a good feeling about all this.
---
I wish bugs and balance were higher priorities...
---
The Truth Is Out There
---
I‚Äôm on PSN, so we‚Äôll never meet. But any vocal fan of MST3K is just a friend of mine I haven‚Äôt met yet. Now push the button, Frank.
---
Yeah, curiously, the last time this happened to me, dying also cured the frozen visual effect too, but maybe it's totally random.
---
Right, AP is precious.  You need it for Dodgy to proc.
---
Player vendors are a better source for things like this than anywhere else.  Look for a reasonably high-level player with a fair bit of Armor in their shop.
---
It probably won't come cheap.
---
In all honesty after the hard push for "You ARE the NPCs" I don't see them pursuing the idea. We have story driven, merchant based, and random encounter NPCs in the form of non human characters. Bethesda has specifically went out of their way to not break the "everyone's dead or schorched/ you alone must reclaim the earth" idea and they're very unlikely to go back on that. Especially when they're still focusing on trying to help level and ease player interactions and community/faction building within the area. To be completely honest I'd be pretty upset if I had to deal with some rando human vault dweller NPCs a year in because they abandoned the HUGE basis that there wouldn't be any human NPCs. They just need to give us more NPC abilities and role playing tools. 
---
That being said, there's definitely "soft maybe" precedence set for introducing humans later on through notes, and holo tapes. The first example is of course that outside of Vault 76 there is a note from scavengers who are scouting saying they'll come back soon.
---
All I want from E3 is a map of the world that glows in the fucking dark.
---
I would too but just watched Bedknobs and Broomstick with my kids so the Portabello Road earworm is lodged in there pretty well.
---

---
There's a tiny glitch that works with black powder guns, as soon as you fire them, switch to your alt weapon, then straight back, and they should be reloaded. Doesn't really save a hell of a lot of time for pistols, but the rifles, Dragons, and Blunderbuss all get loaded slightly quicker.
---
Yeah they don‚Äôt have the switch on the outside, for some weird reason. I bought these way before player vending came out, hoping they would help me de-grief my CAMP. Since they don‚Äôt have the switch on the outside, what I did was add a keypad on my garage door, and a pressure plate on the inside in front of the powered door so I could easily get outside. (I suppose you could use a keypad inside, too, but then that‚Äôs just another key code you have to remember). Hope that helps. Happy CAMPing!
---
I‚Äôve left a sort of compliment tip in beds before, like a 6 pack of cherry cola, or bourbon, ribeye and a cigar. I try to match the tone of the player name and base.
---
This is very, very rare. Most people‚Äôs homes are thoughtless trash garbage. I count myself lucky if I don‚Äôt materialize inside the single foundation block of a floating mess.
---
Whatever it is I‚Äôm not all too bothered 
---
Was Slightly disappointed in this game at first and it definitely should have had a longer beta but it‚Äôs such a fun community and it pretty much now has a fully fledged economy. I mean I buy to sell, I loot to sell and I make to sell. I even trade from a counter at my camp.
---
The other day I literally sat in a game chair and talked to a stranger about random shit as if it was my front lawn. 
---
This game is hilarious because of the good people who play it and I won‚Äôt let the small minority‚Äôs that log into reddit just to rip on a game that isn‚Äôt for them or that they haven‚Äôt played since beta/launch ruin that for me. 
---
Hopefully in 25 minutes I‚Äôm still as hopeful üòÇ

Thanks for saying something, I haven't checked it in a while and was waiting for a price drop so I could have a mule account.
---
personally i just hope thas whatever happen dosent hurt the game
---
Yes, true on both counts.  A Bloodied melee can't do either alone.  I mean, I'm sure someone with a killer build can, but it's very difficult to manage bringing the SBQ down to the ground and keeping her there, as well as running the pylons when you have a tiny bit of HP.  Run-of-the-mill enemies are no sweat, though.
---
My Bloodied build is variable.  I'm usually running around with about 30% HP so I have a cushion to react.  The Bloodied Power Fist still does a little more than 700 damage, so that's still quite a bit, but it's not the 1,500+ you can reach if you're low health and running Unyielding everything.  And I sacrificed some of that power to make a more aesthetically pleasing character who is scantily armored, and yet can hang with the guys in Power Armor and still wreck things. üòÇ
---
I'll buy 76 again if the E3 showing looks impressive. If they show anything.
---
What else is Bethesda showing though? TESO, Eternal and the Wolfenstein spin off?
---
Hoping for big 76 news, Evil Within 3 and Prey 2 personally :/
---
Here's to hoping they recognize the need and popularity of the text chat mod as well.
---
Yeah, other popular mod stuff is text chat, mods that show what parts items contain as strings in the name and other useful things like hard number for hitpoints and building budget instead of just bars.
---
I'll have to try  that.
---
Hey I ended up picking up the game on PC yesterday due to it being on sale so I can add you if you still want
---
I haven't bought it yet because every time I go to look for it on their website and I select Canada/PC it tells me there are no available sellers.
---
I wouldn't do unyielding/ bloodied unless you plan on doing pvp. You will die constantly in pve. Ask me how I know lol. That said if you do plan to play survival you will want at least 12 in perception. 9 for rifleman and I like 3 for tank killer. Demolition all 5. Oh and a big boom stick aka be dragon,be hunting rifle or be lever
---
The nuke alarm siren is my ringtone...
---
Sometimes i sh*t my pants a little when im chilling at my camp and my phone goes off... or when driving lol
---
Yeah, real supported text chat would be awesome.
---
Thanks for the information. I'll take a look at some of those modifications for upcoming armor and weapons when I save up a bit. I snagged of those double-shot explosives that were all the rage back before I quit, they must have got nerfed because it was only a couple hundred caps at some dude's vendor-bot and I don't feel very powerful with it compared to my previous gun. I'll keep farming, questing and looking for upgrades. Thanks for getting me on the right track.
---
I use the scout uniform and the normal vault girl head.
---
Was she constantly asking you how she looked in a new outfit? Did she just have her septum pierced?
---
I don't disagree with you. I meant in terms of bonuses for watching Bethesda's E3 coverage.
---
I'd love for them to announce moddable private servers. Been lurking the game waiting for them to come in
---
I bought Comrade Chubs and it didn‚Äôt count. I found him at Camden Park and it checked off then. I have two more magazines to find, buying one of those didn‚Äôt count either! üòê
---
Just by Dyer Chemical. Thing is, they don‚Äôt always spawn, which is a pain. But they only spawn at night
---
Yea, I've been crafting them, but I seem to always be out of lead, and really it's not such much bullets, which do suck having always be low, but it's keeping my armor repaired that is killing me. Even with the perk-cards, I'm constantly having to repair and it's annoying to keep stocked of ballistic fiber and screws.  I guess it's part of the phone of the game, it is a survival simulator afterall!
---
Check out my post at the bottom of the thread at the link below.  It details how to find lead, steel, etc.  Using workshops is fine if you are completely out of ammo.  Once you have enough ammo, start farming and you'll have tons of ammo.  The only workshops that I use now are Hemlock Holes for Acid and Power plants for Fusion Cores.

WEVE GOT MOVIE SIGN!!!
---
I'm managing to get &gt; 500 DR and ER with no power armor. Using heavy combat hour, perks and the armored backpack. Rad resistance can still be a reason for me to use PA if I'm going to farm a nuke zone, otherwise I can manage it well enough with RadX and RadAway.
---
Fallout 3 remastered one day maybe :(
---
Probs you on PC?
---
I got the perk that plays directional audio when you‚Äôre near a magazine and have kept that on, so far haven‚Äôt found the last two Unstoppables I need but I found several others I would have normally missed. I think I found 4 last night alone!
---
The night thing isn't true since I found one a few hours ago when the sun was up high. But still, it seems to be the only spot in the mire where they are which is annoying.
---
I have a special phrase for folks like you. It goes: No.
---
Sounds like hdd access lag. What‚Äôs your storage? If it‚Äôs HDD then LOL but if it‚Äôs a decent SSD is it over-provisioned properly?
---
Yes I‚Äôm using same perk. It‚Äôs really just rng. That Unstoppable 3 I need has been hiding somewhere lol
---
That‚Äôs me! I usually run a pretty well stocked store by Whitespring Station but currently I have some mini games set up.
---
My zeal feeds off of wonder more than expectation, but suffice to say I am hoping to get a lot of information about nuclear winter.  I saw Todd Howard say in an interview that if it were up to him he would have the shortest time possible between announcement and release, which I think fosters an opportunity, (at least), for surprise announcements about systems or updates that may drop sooner rather than later.  Translation: I‚Äôm like giddy child 13 minutes out here.
---
I wish anything could be worked on in the game without someone making a comment like this.
---
It would be cool if we could have a second character from another vault with different skill priorities. Like how WoW did the death knights. (Although the games are unrelated) I think it‚Äôd be cool to have a second quest line showing Appalachia from a experimental vault view point.
---
Good news is I was doing a quest and I found a power armor anyways lol can‚Äôt equip anything on it but it‚Äôs a start
---
Great idea! I drop mine all the time, but an agreed upon suitcase would be golden!
---
You cant farm for a specific legendary item. Its all completely random.
---
This
---
Can the broken camera found in toolboxes be repaired and used? I thought it was only the Tourist one that worked.
---
TODD HOWARD
---
I'm guessing you are either in Survival, and in survival-mode there should not be safe-zones, or you are in adventure mode and are provoked to attack them. Just turn on pacifist and stay safe. In survival mode anyone can kill you, in advanture mode nobody can kill you unless you have pacifist off and fight back.
---
It is already as safe as it should be.
---
I‚Äôve recently switched from power armor to regular armor and I know what you mean. A level 112 player like me even runs out of ballistic fiber. If I were you, I‚Äôd stick to power armor until you can find good legendaries. 
---
If you‚Äôre running out of lead, pick up cans. Cans are a great source of lead AND steel which are what you use for ammo. A great place to get cans are at the top of the world ski resort (the place where you find the raider robot). In the entrance to the building you‚Äôll find three can chimes which you disarm and get cans. And then in the fort looking place, where the flame thrower traps are you‚Äôll find three more can chimes which means more lead. You just gotta jump up to disarm them. And just don‚Äôt forget to pick up cans whenever you see them for the lead. 
---
When you know you‚Äôll be playing for a long session, take the converted munitions factory to produce some ammo for yourself and build a lead extractor there as well. 
---
Check the mods on your armor too. Some mods like pocketed, or strengthened can lower durability substantially so you may wanna consider ditching deep pocketed for added durability of necessary. 
---
I‚Äôm sorry my response was all over the place but I hope this helps!
---
Yeah, I've got the chef mod, but I can't seem to unlock the bladed mod.
---
"My Stash is full." and "My machines are full." are very common phrases in the "wasteland." I hear "I have a ton more on me if you want to look." often.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
You sell ammo? That's a full machine right there.
---
You have all serums? 19 slots gone. Toss in a few chems and 2nd machine full no problem.
---
No bobbleheads or magazines? Fine, you have 2 machines left for weapons and armors and 0 for junk.
---
Oh wait, we have a vast maximum of 120 slots in our machines, yet the game has well over 1000 plans and mods. Less than 10% of the notes will fit in any player's vendors. Some friends went treasure hunting yesterday. I bought a load of plans out of one of their machines then switched to an alt to buy more around the time he said "I have a bunch more on me that wouldn't fit." He had probably 200 plans and recipes on his person in addition to 4 full machines. Most of it cheap mods that I bought up 20-30 of as soon as he'd set the prices on everything.
---
So yeah, lots of people have lots of stuff they're forced to have on them that they'd be willing so sell. If that's not you, ignore their trade requests and move on. They shoot at you? You have pacifist on right? Ignore that too. They're a douche bag moron but get over it.
---
The machines have no where near the capacity of things I want to sell sometimes. In fact, I'd need twice as many just to be organized like I'd like, with 30 slots or more each. On my vendor character I'd make good if not full use of 8 machines with 50 slots each. Actually, yeah, full, as I just dumped 73lbs of plans on that guy yesterday to get the weight off the ones I actually play.
---
I'm hoping that if Nuclear Winter does turn out to be a battle royale, they put a fun spin on it, that's why Fortnite got so popular in the first place
---
 No point as I use perks and thus has high dr
---
I'll see you in the wasteland: IGN iGhostfire92
---
You can't farm them specifically, but you can sell other things you farm and buy/trade them for a gauss rifle.  Try posting a request on one of the market subs and see what pops up.
---
This idea flares up some true social potential. Quite a lit idea.
---
You on pc? I have a quad something something gauss
---
If im not mistaken, i heard that they actually are at some point. I think juicehead mentioned something about it in one of his videos.
---
Oh really?? Dang, I‚Äôve been going at night this whole time lol. Thanks for the tip! :)
---
They got double-nerfed. Two shot now fires a second shot that only deals +%25 damage, and that's if it hits, and explosive is less broken that it used to be due to a bug. The big whoop now is god roll bloody weapons, but plenty of folks go for other weapons.
---
Include your platform.
---
I would have to agree. I got very lucky and found it on the second place I checked when I went looking. I‚Äôve then run into them multiple times since while going about my normal business at the teapot, Point Pleasant, and Landview Lighthouse. Server hopping works eventually, but it‚Äôs not very fun!
---
Might help if you post your GT and the system you play on. Also, even though it says "ally", you don't actually have to team up with someone. Just revive a non-hostile player and it should count.
---
Mine does 1000+damage without my power swing

I can‚Äôt wait to see Godd Howard crawl out of his cave and bless us with his presence.

Totally forgot it sorry, pc

does it sound like a bloody frog?

Forgot to add System, i play on Pc
---

---
Really hoping for faction CAMP items!
---
I had a weird issue where I thought I'd lost a nice 3* Lever Action.  A couple of days later I found it in my inventory but the game had put  the custom name that I had put on one of my suits of power armor - "PA EX 45" - on the lever action. It didn't show up when I viewed my inventory, only when I went to the repair bench.  Chose to clear the name and bam, it was back in my inventory like normal.  My power armor had reverted back to the default name.
---
I sometimes see a Chinese player (name is Chinese) really late at night take over an entire server's workshops.  Not sure if they are the 'gold-farmers' you hear about or simply a clan that likes to take over a server for themselves.  They are not alone, but it looks like 1 guy takes over the workshops while the others farm for legendaries and help defend the workshops.  I somehow think this might be the [www.u4gm.com](https://www.u4gm.com) guys restocking and duping stuff.
---
Dang there‚Äôs No Pop Corn either :(
---
Must‚Äôve been to that one place that you can launch skeletons lol
---
Blue suitcase at any train station. Alternatively, Vault 76
---
Most of these people don‚Äôt want to trade. They just want to check out your gear.
---
They cant lmao.... leave survival bro
---
If you don‚Äôt like it go to adventure
---
I'm in survival mode, I have no issue being killed or killing outside of my camp. I do have issues with people being able to spawn inside of my camp and kill me at any given moment because they're trolls. At this point I have to turn my vending machines on and off for safety, which is of course a solution but frankly nothing would change for anyone if camps were safe zones. You can't loot a camp anyways.
---
Pls no major pvp mode like BR
---
This is Bethesda's time to save themselves in front of the gaming world. This is more important for them than we think.
---
You wanna set something up for next weekend?
---
It will be a feature, but not the whole thing.
---
There‚Äôs an awful lot of people requesting MY gear while their just checking it out. Lol
---
Heh, was playing with some friends and one had gone to Watoga and had worked their way to the flooded pit where the Murelurk Queen shows up, they go 'Um, there are some Scorchbeasts here, little help?' So I fast travel there and there turned out to be Mirelurk Queen, Mirelurk King, 3 scorchbeasts. Dealt to these and then there was a 4th scorchbeast having a scrap with supermutants so  we headed over and did the ol' hack &amp; slash. Had a lot if meat to cook after all these. üçóü•£ü•£
---
Good deal
---
Ouch. Poor Bessie. Hope the milk won't get sour.
---
If you wait long enough it will come to steam. Or just go to wally world (or whatever you frozen ppl have and pick it up.).
---
Found it for 30 freedom dollars there or wait for Amazon for around 20. I opted to go pick it up.
---
Cool what's your time zone and what's a good time for you?
---
They need to add new content soon
---
I held four simultaneously a month or so ago. It was a lot of running around for Defend events, and I had no PvP interactions and no one contested. I did get majorly stocked up on fusion cores and lead so it was worth it. At least the FT was free between them! I ended up teaming up with someone on the server to pass them on after a few hours because I was tired :)
---
No, I have not yet. I'll take a look at it later, thanks.
---
Same here! Great opportunity to do so, perk cards are a choice. All these people making it sound like DR perk cards are not optional lol.
---
Let‚Äôs go!
---
Too bad! Great opp to go with berserker. No one seems to use them :(
---
Honestly, considering how they have commented on being prepared for this to not be a stellar success, I suspect the game will run until whenever Fallout 5 launches, and 5 will just have a multiplayer mode or something. Hell, they stuck with TESO.
---
Pete Hines is alive? Been awhile since we have seen him.

Hey there, about to throw my controller at the TV because I can‚Äôt get the visit bridge task to complete! Were you able to finish metalworks? Thanks in advance!!

Was that a Filthy casuals shirt ? Represent !

Strange! I‚Äôm going to check the repair bench then

If you are on PC, I have a few Gauss Rifles I won't use...

The survivors in the Wasteland are a small but dedicated canvases.

Good cheers tho lol

TODDDDDDD

Yeah, I really can't see them making camps safe in survival mode. That could be exploited in any number of ways.
---
GODDDDDD

Yeah, pretty loud
---
This happens to me on almost every engagement. So frustrating.

Why does he go first this year ?
---
Me too, Todd.

Love the honesty Todd. Fix it! We love the game. I can‚Äôt wait to hear what‚Äôs added!!!
---
We are the best community!
---
What level are you? I‚Äôm 115 right now and it takes me ~50 shots with my Gatling gun to take it out. I think the other comment is right; if you‚Äôre high level and wasting a ton of ammo, you‚Äôre doing something wrong
---
He needs to. With the amount of time Fallout 76 was in the headlines for negative reasons, getting it out of the way is the best possible PR move.
---
I‚Äôm so proud of this community!
---
I love it. He realizes how nice we are lol
---
He must've been hibernating till the next E3
---
Lol I was totally joking...no disrespect to pin players.
---
Yeah. It sounded like 20 really enthusiastic people.
---
Yeah, it is coming to steam later this year. Perhaps a date for this will be part of the announcements.
---
So u just need to create a new xbox live account or whatever platform your on?
---
Get yourself a bloodied weapon, bloodied explosive if you can, that'll save you a hell of alot of ammo!

Oft i feel your pain.

TOD HOWARD!!
---
I wish i had even an ounce of the charisma of Todd Howard
---
Its a little funky but it should settle hopefully
---
Increase carry weight and strength for melee attacks, there is benefits with just the chassis, so good going but yeah if you want armor pieces, its too early. 
---
Also the ability to jump off anything and not take fall damage is the reason why I always carry one. 
---
So there is benefits to power armor for even early players but you won'tfully get use out of it until later.
---
I don‚Äôt think you understand how they work.

Fallout 76 on live now.

Next friday night?
---
Not trying to upset you but what your asking from survival mode is basically the opposite of what survival mode is and is intended by Bethesda.
---
I play survival mode knowing that at any moment, by anybody in anyway I could get killied.
---
If your hanging out in your camp their is a high probability you will be killied. I keep stealthed when in my camp with chameleon if people come I dont trust I stealth and assisnate or wait for them to leave. If your trading with a vendor In Survival you are a brace person.
---
My point Adventure mode is friendly, Survival is supposed to be high risk zone that always keeps me tense.
---
Sweet man thankyou! I was a little dumbstruck so im not afraid to admit i gave up for a little while
---
Do you happen to have any of the 1x2 stairs pieces in your building? I've noticed if I put one of those down it won't let me put walls or roofs above it and I usually have to scoot it somewhere else.

I've talked trash about this game ever since release and now that the updates are coming, I'm honestly thinking that this is starting to become an amazing game. I came from ESO which also had a horrible launch but it came a long way since then. If Bethesda keeps updating this game, FO76 will definitely be a top notch game soon.
---
Fuck yes
---
YES!!! YES!!! YES!!! NPCs. YES! YES! Fuck this is what I wanted from the beginning. Thank you! Thank you. Thank you!
---
This kinda feels like what the game was supposed to be in the first place.

OK, full dialogue interface, human NPC's. Yearly stories. My god, I'm glad I bought this game. So much to look forward to!

Well like i tell all my friends, i‚Äôm really good at getting hit.
---
FALLOUT 76 FIGHT CLUB
---
WAS THAT THE HELLFIRE POWER ARMOR?
---
I have zero interest in a Fallout 76 BR, but this looks cool as hell.
---
HELLFIRE POWER ARMOR
---
A fucking battle Royale mode LUL
---
And crossbows!
---
FalloutNite dances !
---
Players could survive but not NPCs?
---
Anyone else spot the anti material rifle and the hellfire armor?
---
Exclusive perks?
---
Same here. I had a 3 point skill I ditched for lockpicking a while ago. I recently replaced those with the ones with the audio for cap stashes, magazines, and bobbleheads.  I can't believe how many of them I've walked by dozens of times without knowing they were there.
---
52 player! Holy shit it looks great
---
BOWS! :D
---
Hmm, I mean it‚Äôs extra content for people that like BRs
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
Here's hoping for a centaur
---
I wish that was the case but unfortunately I can play any other game without any problem whatsoever.  This game is simply put "a train wreck".  It should have never been released let alone had another season of content without first fixing the problem.  
---
   I'm not sure how, but it's actually worse since the last patch.
---
For everyone saying, beth would not put in battle royal. There you go, battle royal.. smh
---
npcs
---
how inovative
---
FUCK
---
#HELL YEAH
---
Who are you overseeing? You killed everyone.
---
But no private servers or mod support :(
---
I love how the lead designer for Fo76 pronounces it "Nucular"
---
So...
---
Bows, gold sifting, NPCs, dialog trees, time progression, BR mode, new FEV mutants, rebuilt areas (space station)... did I miss anything?
---
You were right
---
 lolololololol
---
booo BR
---
Not with a meta only pvp system
---
Well hey, there are NPCs so that should reduce some of the hate. Has the oldschool style dialogue too I think
---
Nuclear winter and free trial tomorrow
---
No, fix the fucking game first. Then add content. Not a fucking br.
---
it honestly doesn't seem that bad
---
Battle Royale? Yawn. Seems like 76 is just playing catch-up with the gaming industry. First it was a rust clone, now is going for a PUBG route. Why can't it just embrace being a great RPG?
---
All I really want to know is benefits of prestiging...
---
Battle Royale is actually happening?  What revolting timeline is this?
---
Jfc this crowd is ridiculous lol
---
Really? A battle royal? Must be getting desperate over there.
---
Originally I would be mad but that looked cool so I‚Äôm actually suprised
---
"what do you guys want?"
---
well just don't put a battle royale in there under any circumstances
---
"we listened to the fans and they said they want battle royale"
---
ugh
---
hey! I'm actually having the same issue.. terminal never works. I will have the message displayed that I need to take it there at VTU but after that nothing. Sucks cause isn't this a trophy?
---
Sucks for all us solo players
---
If this game had Rage 2's engine and gunplay it would have been a colossal success. Such a missed opportunity.
---
You watch the rest?
---
I‚Äôm on the floor.
---
Vault tec was never known for thinking too far ahead
---
I was not looking forward to a possible BR but the presentation was actually enticing. They may change my mind.
---
I just men's out loud. Really loudly. And then I had to explain to my non-gaming wife. She just lost all respect for me. Thanks a lot, Todd.
---
God save Toff Howard!
---
IM LOSING MY SHIT RN
---
Who cares? Who complains about an entirely free new game mode. Come on guys, grow up
---
Can‚Äôt wait for the glitches.
---
I call him daddy long legs, he runs away from you if you try and get close, just like my dad
---
This looks so good
---
Can't wait to try this out tomorrow!
---
It seems BR fans are here oof
---
Its walking over empty bottles
---
IKR it looks so amazing
---
Funny, the crowd sounds like it's bringing down the house with cheering, but if you look only the people in the front are cheering, like 90% of the crown is not moving or anything.
---
But it sounds thunderous.
---
Also, the npc's will either be unkillable, or copy pasted generic unimportant ones with randomly generated kill or fetch quests.
---
Battle royale is also so uninteresting.
---
I refunded my copy, this wont bring me back.
---
That Nuclear Winter trailer was sick
---
I got the tent and stores, no coins
---
The br looks imesnley fun, and the npcs and other stuff is a great addition
---
Same! I was legit clapping for this stuff
---
"thats right we put a battle royale in fallout 76"
---
I bet he thought it was so cool when he said that, fuck this guy seriously.
---
Who cares. NPCs are coming!
---
ikr, what a shitshow lol.
---
Lame as fuck
---
I'm disappointed at how bad the outside communities' perceptions about this game are. Even a community that's usually fantastic was an absolutely toxic shitshow during the stream. I never realized until now just how bad yongyea and all the other clickbait cunts have ruined the public image of the game
---
Yeah a free entire new mode, what dicks eh?
---
Yikes. That does not look great. We never asked for a Battle Royale
---
It was a three headed abomination that walked on its long ass arms, and had spindly little feet hands. I hate it and love it. 
---
That‚Äôs the kind of mutants that we need in Fallout. 
---
Still miss centaurs though.
---
hYPE
---
More content, heck yeah
---
Zero intersting in playing and unnecessary
---
I think so!
---
Sometimes I try to invite them to my team then I write with the lettering and leave a secret note for them to find somewhere in their base.
---
Everything else looks fully fledged though!
---
Looks fun. Did they say tomorrow is open for a sneak peak?
---
It legit never said free to play lmao
---
ANOTHER GAME MODE I DONT HAVE TO PLAY? REEEEEEEEEEEEEE &gt;:(
---
That's the name
---
I'm fine with it.  It's another game mode. Its optional for players who like that kind of game
---
Windigo/ deathclaws hybrids!?
---
It‚Äôs real.  Oh it‚Äôs real.
---
ring of fire sums up the entire game completely
---
Knew this was coming. Didn‚Äôt think it was something to be a dick about,  but that‚Äôs cool. You had the time to come up with it and hats off to you. Still had a discussion about it that I enjoyed. Looks like something that will be fun!
---
Cool, cool. Kinda expected it at this point. I have had fun with it in other games, even though I royaly suck in PvP, but I will give it a shot here too.
---
Yes
---
It fits perfectly
---
Free content all the way
---
About the same as any other developer. Even if you have an amazing brand you want to make sure that one guy who hates you isn‚Äôt in the background booing. Ask any politician at a pep rally.
---
I'm not that into the BR game mode, but this looks like a lot of fun. I'll give it a good go.
---
A way for me to get better at PvP, hopefully without losing caps? I'm for it.
---
Yes it did.  Free trial for this week for ANYONE.
---
"WE" DUUUR THE REDDIT REPRESENTS THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUR
---
It's an additional game mode. I wont play it but if people enjoy it who cares.
---
I should‚Äôve never left Vault 76. Should‚Äôve just stayed there forever, even if I‚Äôd die.
---
I can‚Äôt wait for Wastelanders, but I hope it‚Äôs more than a handful of NPCs and a new main quest that can be finished in an hour.
---
NPCS AND ROYALE! LET'S FUCKING GO, THE ENCLAVE PA FROM 3!! GONNA GET MY FUCKING HANDS ON THAT SHIT
---
Zero interest in playing it
---
It did.
---
Both of them look amazing
---
So the battle royale was real
---
wew lad
---
Free trial, that's basically the same as free to play, just for a time limited period
---
They listen!! They really do!! How awesome!
---
I'm hyped
---
Dumb. The world doesn't need more Battle Royale modes.
---
Think of all the low level fodder for the 52 player BR. Can‚Äôt wait
---
Itll be cool to try out once or twice I suppose. But there's so much other content to be excited for.
---
I honestly don't mind it. I'll play it.
---
here you go man https://i.imgur.com/HY1EHZS.png
---
10th-17th I believe
---
Make sure to be nice to the free trial players.
---
[Beast from Trailer ](https://imgur.com/a/PZXEdy6)
---
Engrish?
---
I love watching the mods deleting these threads in real time
---
I made a new Bethesda account. It should work for console. But I haven't touched one since mass effect 2 came out.
---
Not really much of a Battle Royale person, but I'll probably give it a shot. who knows, maybe I'll actually enjoy it?
---
&gt; Why would they nerf builds in the core game because of BR meta?
---
Because it's Bethesda and ass backward decision isn't exactly out of their wheel house...
---
A couple of hundred people on this reddit isn't the entire community.
---
Oh I thought it meant that time progresses as we play
---
I bet you think you are a funny person, you aren't.
---
Something is off about the crowd. All the noise and motion is coming from the front, and they are definitely overreacting to a lot of things.
---
I always assumed that with Starfield and ES6 in development, they'd have to take some 'time off'. In the mean while we got a shitty online FO game that helps them bring in revenue in the mean time &amp; a shitty ES mobile game. At least we didn't get absolutely nothing for years.
---
To be fair, that actually did feature a lot if Reddit back before Survival came along and the PvP folks meh'ed it up.
---
Dead faster than BFV br
---
A fucking battle royale. Lovely.
---
And your only takeaway was battle royal?
---
I fucking love the hype guy always going ‚ÄúYEAAAAA‚Äù
---
 I‚Äôm both not at all shocked and absolutely giddy that NPCs are coming. And actual stats used in conversation too!
---
Oh shit, unkillable?  More like UNPLAYABLE, am I right?
---
If you need it to be that immersive, go hunting or something.
---
Loads fine for me. Biggest news: VATS only works on AI.
---
Show us on the doll where I touched you...
---
Oh damn you're right
---
If it was the entire game, I‚Äôd be annoyed. As a separate game mode within 76 though, I‚Äôm looking forward to trying it. Can always just stick to adventure mode if I don‚Äôt like it
---
You do realize that PVP is completely broken, right? NW will literally be full of either people who will one-shot you or people who you physically cannot kill. They will have to ban Bloodied, Caviler, and Sentinel  for it to be even remotely fair for people who actually play a rpg game as it was intended.
---
I used BB too. One day last week I fast traveled back to my camp outside white springs right in the middle of it being attacked by 3 scorch beasts. Killed them and got 3 different organs, no meat. Then I remembered BB. Checked all 3 bodies and got 1 meat, nothing, 2 meat. Ditched my PA, ran to my cooking station, scrolled down to the recipe and couldn't make it because of the cranberries. Mad rush to get them as fast as possible because I'm expecting the meat to spoil. I've never been so happy to cook something.
---
I think the PvE aspects it looks to have will definitely help it out. A standard PvP BR game would have likely been horrible in Fallout. It‚Äôs just not designed for heavy, hardcore PvP like that. But adding in tough AI challenges as well will give it its own unique touch as well as keeping it very Fallout-esque
---
Thats 110% a centaur, and holy fuck its terrifying
---
I don‚Äôt like that type of play style, but I think I‚Äôll give it a try. It‚Äôs definitely not gonna stop me from playing a game I already enjoy. But extreme of your friend, no?
---
I can't watch the video, I just keep getting an error. What's up with the bows and space station?
---
I can‚Äôt wait to shoot it
---
Weren't you listening? They listen to feedback! They love it! lol
---
You.get.to.shoot.raiders
---
I've been here a long time and the one constant from even before it was launched was "please god no fucking battle royale"
---
Harvesting junk piles without resource extractor.  Just getting the raw materials. Found three this way.
---
It felt really sad but I was literally shouting 'YES' over and over lol the rest of the year looks like it's gunna blow Wild Appalachia out of the water
---
like an entire new questline with voiced NPCs along with hundreds of fixes and upgrades?
---
No but that's what that were discussing when I posted that comment.   That's how a live chat works. 
---
How did you possibly not get that?
---
What are they gonna do? Not in the loop lol
---
Yeah let‚Äôs ignore the wasteland trailer right before that‚Äôs adding npcs, dialogue, choice and consequences
---
Very much looking forward to this! I am quite happy about it!
---
Human NPCs  and  the good old "talking" ..we will be playing lotsa fo76
---
It‚Äôs not based on your clothing, it‚Äôs based on your total DR, and if you have more than 60 DR it ends up breaking even and doing the same damage as a regular weapon. With the combination of perks I‚Äôm using, I have over 200 DR even fully naked. So, there is literally no point and I end up hurting myself by using them.
---
That's totally understandable and hopefully they find a way to separate their balances per mode. But overall as a strictly pve player, I think it's great that all different types of fallout fans are getting a way to explore a wasteland that suits their gameplay styles. Its extra  free content for other playerbased. The more players, the more money for them to add content for everyone. Seems like a win to me.
---
FEV reject? Seems like aside from battle royale there‚Äôs going to be a small sidequest for the roleplayers? Somehow involving mutants trying to populate
---
Why don‚Äôt you check the same topic posted below!
---
Dropping it. Lol
---
Frankly I don‚Äôt care one way or the other for BR. I‚Äôm not that kind of player, I suck at Multiplayer shooters. But if some people like it, why not let them have that mode? It‚Äôs optional right? I‚Äôll be in the normal mode, walking through the towns, doing stories, trading, and rebuilding.
---
How is splitting the player base 3 ways a bad thing? And who cares if no-one will play it after 2-3 weeks? 
---
**It's free. It's optional.**
---
'Nobody' played the damn building mode/quests in FO4 either - yet I didn't see people getting outraged that they included that feature in.
---
Can‚Äôt wait to take on dragons as Sans and Garfield
---
I hate it, Im to much of a goody two-shoes and since its online everytime i do something accidentally bad,I cant reverse it  and i'll feel bad :(
---
I have no interest in it at all.
---
I really don't like how this sounds so far... I never wanted NPCs in this game, not having them in the first place is why I love FO76 so much. 
---
Also, Battle Royale? Seriously? This is disappointing to me.
---
Everyone is like hey cool side activity! I am like hey, they probably spent significant dev resources on implementing that "cool" side activity instead of something the game could use more than trend chasing.
---
Yup. I keep telling him, "it's not like they are removing all the parts you like." He just keeps saying "Why don't they add what we want?" Which his only complaint with F76 aside from bugs was no human npcs but now I don't know why he thinks they aren't doing what we want.
---
Don't worry, we will just launch four nukes and crash it to get champion
---
Fallout 3 takes place in 2277 and Hellfire is there
---
I agree, the game properly begins at that point.
---
Did someone say tightly whitey?
---
I don‚Äôt know why everyone hates BR so much? It‚Äôs like adding a Team Death-match mode. I love it add a BR to every game ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
True.
---
My bad, 2281 is Fallout 4.
---
76 doesn't need it unless they fix PVP. No real need to say what's broken, since everyone knows. Remove the one-shot and unkillable builds in the mode and then in 10 years I might consider thinking about thinking about playing.
---
Don't play it then.
---
Todd Howard you sick evil beautiful son of a bitch
---
Yeah...it would allow us to make offers on things in their vending machines too...
---
So for Australian servers, 90% of the time you hop back to the same server. Imagine looking for your camera then...
---
Truth is... the game was rigged from the start.
---
\[It looks like everyone will be on an even playing field\]( [https://bethesda.net/en/article/4f9q90xXpnRJ8vlIWVJxVK/fallout-76-nuclear-winter-is-coming?\_ga=2.87805976.1053286306.1560128438-1572240870.1560128438](https://bethesda.net/en/article/4f9q90xXpnRJ8vlIWVJxVK/fallout-76-nuclear-winter-is-coming?_ga=2.87805976.1053286306.1560128438-1572240870.1560128438) )
---
Feels like this is a great setup for a joke. FIGHT OFF MONSTERS, DEFEAT EVERYONE, BECOME THE OVERSEER....
---
...of no one. WOMP WOMP.  
---
Definitely fits with some of the sense of humor in Fallout.
---
Wait how is Hellfire Power Armor in Appalachia? Does this perhaps point towards a time-jump of a couple hundred years?
---
Yay
---
Just dont
---
The toxic circle jerk is getting really stale man. You dont like it, move on. You look like a child right now.
---
Yup! I di bot like battleroyal and the idea if it in a fallout game I thought was laughable. But I'm really excited to play it this week.
---
I wont be playing it but ima lol at all the bugs that ppl will whine about, I mean they cant even fix the ones in the normal game its going to be even more of a clusterfuck lmao
---
I guess you both are missing my point. Naked is the best way to go for Beserkers. Your post gave me hope that you had tried it. You hadn‚Äôt, no big deal. I know how it works, the cards you chose prevent beserkers from being an option for you, that‚Äôs fine. You would have had to have had beserkers in mind when you chose your perks from the start.
---
lol Bethesda is not going bankrupt.
---
None of your perks or weapons carry over to the BR mode.
---
Absolutely no way that‚Äôs happening
---
Has no effect on adventure mode so i don‚Äôt see why it matters.
---
I too look forward to the nuke apocalypse
---
real question is, does it lead to anything real or just getting a few caps like in fallout 4
---
you can buy all the xo1 plans now at the production vendor in the whitesprings bunker.  buy the plan and make them yourself
---
The crowd seems overly-reactive, a bit too-reactive.
---
Did you seriously save this comment for a month?
---
*Both the Settlers and the Raiders will present you with unique companions, stories and plenty of new weapons and armor to earn.*
---
COMPANIONS. Oh shit.
---
AND ANTI-MATERIEL RIFLE
---
Centaurs older brother.
---
Did it look like to anyone else that the space station could be a persistent player-driven thing... build up the station together as a community?
---
I still like the game. I don‚Äôt need to like BR to like the game.
---
Just as immersive as any other of their previous titles. 
---
Any less should be unacceptable to actual fans.
---
I've started nuking workshops for the enemy wave spawning to get the High Radiation Fluids and Glowing/Hardened Masses, and I found nuking inbetween Wade Airport and Lakeside Cabins maximised the output whilst being pretty solid for flux. Having a nukezone in the forest really made for a nice change of scenery too.
---
Where is that?
---
Not my thing but I'm hype about that fall update.
---
/s means sarcasm, friends. I'm excited for it.
---
Will you say that when the second to last player leaves and it's just you?
---
so does this mean that when new players take up the game it will start differently than it did for all of us who have played from the start?
---
It's a cheap shot. Bethesda is not what it used to be some years ago, the new way forward is strictly $$$ and only $$$
---
Oh for sure. Liked the preview for Wastelanders.
---
yeeeeeeeeessssssssss
---
I have plenty of games I actively play and enjoy.
---
I'm allowed to have my opinion.
---
I was caught off guard completely with this update and I am absolutely ecstatic. Fallout is back, Baby! And I dont like battle royal in general. Yet I am excited to try it.
---
One concept: "opportunity cost". Yeah a BR mode is cool but imagine all the other things they could've done but they used resources (time) on that. Also, pretty sure community's opinion would be even worse because of this so I highly doubt they'll find rentable to keep maintenance for the BR servers...
---
this didn't age well
---
I surprised he wasn't teamed up with those high levels and just playing bait
---
Also me lol.
---
Looks good, now give me an offline mode and I'll be very happy
---
Considering how... Rough the 76 launch was I give Bethesda an insane amount of credit for really listening to player feedback
---
I agree
---
I don't care about human NPCs because an NPC is an NPC no matter what it looks like. Robots are NPCs. But the REAL story here is a dialogue system and better/in-depth quests and stuff.
---
I've been on the FO76 train since day one but I'm very excited for this too, and I hope more people give the game a chance in the future!
---
Have we gotten that new gramophone as a camp item yet? That is mostly likely the answer to this question.
---
I understand why your confused, they didn't explain it we
---
I really can‚Äôt believe they‚Äôre forcing people to enter Battle Royale 76 times before being able to access other play modes.
---
I don‚Äôt play Battle Royale games, so I will contentedly just.... not play it.  I think it‚Äôs great that they‚Äôre trying to expand their player base and make some money to keep developing/adding content.     The same game I‚Äôve been enjoying is still going to be there, with some cool new shit.  Fans of things that I‚Äôm a fan of embarrass the hell out of me.
---
I mean, if the game would have been better from the start their vision would have been really great.
---
Like starting out with no NPCs, it's your turn to clear the wasteland.
---
Then after a while NPCs come back.
---
But they screwed it, that's really sad. And how is the main campaign going to work with the NPCs around? If I start playing it then and there are NPCs around, does it make any sense anymore?
---
You‚Äôre what‚Äôs wrong with gaming
---
huh?
---
Did you watch this trailer?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2XdwS4lcZM
---
I just hope it hasn't taken too many resources away from the concept we bought in on.
---
Fortnite Save the World pretty much died to BR. Regular 76 better not go the same way.
---
Wow a voiced questline featuring NPCs, it's almost as if they planned to continue the story through content drops like most popular online games. If only they'd hinted that at launch by saying future content would be free or something.
---
This sounds like the proper way to balance a battle royale mode. I dont know how people can be mad at this.
---
It sounds like Nuclear Winter has its own completely separate progression. The trailer mentioned new exclusive perks. And it is BR, so you‚Äôll have to find new items every game. 
---
Honestly, the second anything is announced for this game it is immediately followed by ‚ÄúmY BuiLd Is GoInG tO gEt nErFed‚Äù and other such drivel. 
---
Can someone explain that people can express their hesitation without baseless speculation?
---
Ooh, let's hopenmy dude
---
2 hours without stashing your junk? Bad idea, now you know better?
---
10-17 is FTP week, sneak peek starts in 10th and idk when it ends
---
Starting tomorrow. June 10-17th
---
I‚Äôm watching live
---
Adding battle royal?
---
Sir, are you having a stroke?
---
well it's nothing we haven't said here for months
---
Wow yet ANOTHER mobile game lol
---
Drink each time a post is deleted.

2198
---
The Enclave resumes work on various pre-War technologies, including power armor variations. None of these are much of an improvement over the conventional old power armor, and some are actually worse.
---
2215
---
Under Presidential Order, Enclave scientists begin to work on an upgraded version of power armor. Many prototypes are developed and tested.
---
2220
---
October: Enclave scientists develop a reliable version of the Mark II power armor. The prototype results (and accidents... and explosions... and deaths) are classified by order of the new President Richardson for the sake of morale.
---
Hmm... One hell of a retcon. A minimum of 118 years ahead of schedule. Hmm.
---
This is what i wonder.   
---
"But they're adding a mode i don't want to play."  
---
Then don't play.  
---
"But it takes away from making other content."  
---
No, it doesn't. Multiple employees can work on multiple things. At worst is just pushes other content down the line, which extends the life of the game.  
---
I hate BR. I will most likely not even try it. But i don't see what the problem is.
---
Maybe add a guest book for us to sign
---
Yes and you're a paid commenter.
---
Dude, even if you disagree you don't have to be mean. You're putting yourself on the same level as the person you're making fun of.
---
You ever see a scorchbeast?
---
Yeah.  My best drop from the vendor is a \*\*\* instigating crossbow with VATs perks.  Great sniper/stealth weapon, but NO MODS for the crossbow! and I'm a heavy gunner... I'll hand it down to my alt who is a stealth/rifle build (still too low level to use cool stuff yet...)
---
So according to the article on their website, there will be new items in the BR that can carry over to Adventure like CAMP plans. So looks like I will be trying it for those.
---
Would've helped if they released a finished game first.
---
I wish man
---
I don't even notice any more. I was so tired of hearing the same whining complaints over and over that I was already referring to them all as Marcy before the game even came out. Like her they also eventually faded into easily ignored background noise.
---
I don't like BR's but I'll give this a shot, it looks interesting.
---
Oh right, for a second I thought you meant dragons as well as scorchbeasts
---
Finished it, yeah. I think I just crisscrossed it multiple times. The camera one for it was annoying, i had to go to a pretty specific spot underneath the east end of the bridge to get it ID‚Äôd in the viewfinder. Another redditor clued me in to that.
---
Because it will attract new players.
---
It‚Äôs a lighted sign, isn‚Äôt it?
---
And I would really love to see what new weapons they introduce.
---
Do not like*. I appreciate your concern, I'm just hyped over the news.
---
100% this.
---
shitpost
---
I don't know but if I see one I'm running. You'll be able to find me via the trail of pee.
---
They released full details here https://bethesda.net/en/article/4f9q90xXpnRJ8vlIWVJxVK/fallout-76-nuclear-winter-is-coming?_ga=2.75713680.446335520.1560127839-2059746069.1556484906
---
I think they are handling it perfectly.
---
A bunch of lowbies. What are they gonna do
---
So i havn't played since a few months after launch. Is power armor still nearly required for rad protection in nuke zones, or is it actually possible to be a non power armor build?
---
Or, you know, literally everything else they talked about, in addition to BR?
---
and you got the impression from that that it's a small sidequest?
---
Okay thank you gandhi
---
It's just junk, it's literally everywhere. Go get more and remember to stash it next time.
---
Sick. Color me intrigued
---
Nah. Servers will just crash
---
On the psn store the discount is available from 6/7-6-17
---
Probably tuesday

I had that happen with an animal. Tried Animal Perk to tame a Radstag Doe to test it. Got back to CAMP, and no Doe. Until! I open the door, and she's stuck in my closed in stairwell, on the stairs blocking access to everything. Had to pull half my house down to get it out, and then was left with the mess of trying to rebuild with the usual "Can't Place Object here",despite the fact it was there in the first place.
---
Toxic doesnt really matter, everyone starts off balanced and you cant use mics, so you dont have to worry
---
Not sure your level other than low and starting today but why aren't you following the quest line? IF your trying to go up against a  lvl 50+ Mirelurk Queen in the first few hours you are WAY off course! FYI - levels 50-100+ get beat by the  Mirelurk Queen  quite a bit as well... low level armor and weapons isn't going to do anything to her...  
---
Stick with the Overseers journey first and do the quests surrounding that and you'll also find nicer people that could help you out.   
---
Stash box is your new BFF... learn the places that have them and scrap everything! Bulk if you can to save weight.
---
All that I've learned from this is to avoid other players
---
When fo3 came out i was scared of the mole rats.
---
So yeah
---
Sounds great to me. Actually very excited for Nuclear Winter.
---
How are they forcing you to play it?
---
No problem kid. Just the internet has to teach you this instead of your failed parents. Have a nice evening.
---
Oh im with you! Just take out the whole Team word and you nailed it. More for y'all.
---
I am glad i kept faith. It stemmed from how eso turned out and has continued being one of if not the most populated mmo at the moment. Things are looking bright for sure my dude!
---
Still can't find the terminal  ü§î do you happen to know the specific location?
---
Tomorrow. June 10
---
I‚Äôm just confused by what they mean by ‚Äúsneak peak?‚Äù  Does it actually release tomorrow?
---
Sorry to hear that man. Raiders aren't just NPCs, and you gotta watch your back. Trust me, one day you will get to the point that you wish someone would take your resources. 
---
If you need any specific items that are a bitch to get, I recommend hitting a player vending machine with plenty of Junk. Stuff is usually pretty reasonably priced. Avoid vendorbots if possible.
---
I really like the way they set this up.
---
Probably normal update time?
---
Indeed. That don't make that opinion worthless, though. You know, like flat earthers and anti-vaxxers. They're allowed their opinions too. And just like them, I'm just going to point, laugh, and move on. Cheers buddy.
---
And what if the benefits of introducing the mode (i.e. revenues from new players) outweigh the additional development/running costs (which may be relatively small)?
---
HIt the lower level SB areas like by White Springs OR when the SBQ gets nuked there should be at least 2-4 SB around.
---
Sure, if you casually ignore everything they've added since launch, bringing in NPC's, and skill checks. But there's always gotta be people to find the negative
---
That's a given. 
---
I'm sorry for your loss.
---
Damn that's a tough one. Simply can't decide if i like it what they showed or not... But fall will getting interesting. Thats for sure!
---
Vault 79 is shown in the cover art of the wastelander dlc along with tons of new and returning weapons
---
It's basically TDM or FFA but starting from nothing and with an ever-reducing-in-sizw map. I don't see the issue. I sucked at CoD and I'll suck at this too so, yay! But I'll have fun doing it lmao
---
It's the nail in the coffin for me. Hope Bethesda crashes and burn.
---
It's been 50 minutes and all we've seen is an apology, a plea for players to trust them again, a plethora of mobile games.  This better get good soon this shit is wack so far.
---
"Factions of Raiders and Settlers aim to make the world their own and claim a rumored fortune. Who you side with is up to you, and your choices will determine their fates. Both the Settlers and the Raiders will present you with unique companions, stories and plenty of new weapons and armor to earn. Wastelanders will fundamentally change the way you experience Fallout 76, and it‚Äôs set to arrive in fall of 2019."
---
Companions too!
---
No problem kid, just sad that the internet has to teach you how to be a human instead of your parents. Have a nice evening.
---
IRK!!! i am a single stya ant hpome mom, my boy is 9 now, and we cant waite to do some of thsi new content togehter! we hope boxses come soon
---
LMAO. Yep. You nailed it!
---
If it‚Äôs just Battle Royale I don‚Äôt see much reason to add new cryptids, armour and weapons sure but something like that would need a backstory, ergo I theorise there will be some PvE content to explain that, even if it‚Äôs a 10 minute quest
---
Totally random I‚Äôm afraid
---
As useless as it is there is something fun about using one with the mirv mod to carpet bomb a small area.
---
Human NPS &gt; Yes please.    Battle Royal &gt;  Am fine if it's a separate game mode and won't force me into it.
---
It is just 1 plain lonely terminal. In the 2 story tall hangers I believe. Production, not science wing, etc.
---
Its optional? Yes. But if there will be unique loot attached to it then its not optional as getting loot is a major point of the game.
---
99% chance you only played fo76 up to level 20 anyways
---
Isnt it June 10th already? At which time? :D I Imagine the download will be huge, want to start right away.
---
Definitely a laser musket. Would be awesome to see some more older game weapons arrive
---
I'm not even trying to burn you boy, I'm  trying to make you reconsider your life decisions since you sound like the type of guy who thinks he's cool because he insults people on the internet and that's just pathetic. And btw, I'm nice over here. No hate in my life unlike you :)
---
Rule 34 is already at work
---
I got mine from watoga next to the vertibird on the roof of the??? Sports center?
---
Do I see a Plasma Caster?
---
Ah then that‚Äôs my bad
---
you ever play any other fallout game?
---
If you like it, fuck em
---
It wouldnt even seem like fallout at the point. Might as well play battle royal or something. I got bored with that game pretty quick
---
I've been here since Beta, and for a long time it was nonstop "Add a real PvP mode." Hate to point this out, but that's what a genuine PvP mode looks like in this day and age, if it's not a tactical or team based shooter (and built to be such). Any real PvP mode was going to be either the watered down PvP of survival, which hasn't exactly taken off, or a BR slugfest.
---
Personally, I hate BR modes, but then, I'm also nto a PVPer.
---
Just bought the game. Any advice?
---
No I don‚Äôt.  I restarted the ps4 and can now attach roof pieces but not a second floor
---
This is how it should be. Wipe mostly clean and get new gear. Then do your best. Mostly level field.
---
Okay gurlfriend  *snap snap*
---
Oh god no.
---
We get to hear our characters voice for the first time unless it‚Äôs like fallout 3 and nv
---
Yeah, just play the game and explore. Don‚Äôt focus too much on having the best of the best stuff, or specializing in a certain build. Do some quests and just have fun with it
---
do not worry about fast leveling just enjoy yourself, do not take over workshops unless you are ready for potential PVP encounters. Stay out of survival mode until you are comfortable with the game.
---
Idk what you‚Äôre even talking about now man. Your post didn‚Äôt say anything about two shot. I just simply though it would be cool if you had tried beserkers....jfc
---
I would lump in people who are still giving fallout 76 their money and think the game is a complete worth while experience with idiots who think the world is flat.
---
if you don't join the event after a while the game will say your workshop was over run by whatever and give you a mission to take it back. As long as it wasn't a player that took it, you'll still be able to fast travel there and still get the reward once you clear it. When I do this, I just go defend them whenever I get ready to. Unless it says "stop the intruders from taking your workshop" that's the warning for another player. You'll lose it if you don't go immediately.
---
Honestly it all LOOKS good.  But if all this comes at the cost of 30 fps gameplay, constant disconnects, and prone sliding ghouls, evaporating legendary enemies and loot, and broken quests I'd rather they hold off and fix the fundamentals.  THEN give us Nuke Winter goodness buttery smooth with lots of \*\*\* legendaries.
---
The fallout sub circle jerk came here for the night thats why, itll go away in a week like at launch lol
---
Its possible.
---
Conan exiles has it, works great and is insane for RP.
---
Am I going blind or does that vault door say 79
---
I'm not a BR fan in general but I'm extremely excited for Nuclear Winter.
---
I seek ammo for like one cap per bullet. That and plans.
---
Isn't it great how much I get downvoted for just stating my honest opinion? I loved the game so far and I appreciate the work Bethesda continues to put into it, but this is just not for me.
---
go away.
---
Yo! Bethesda is not fucking around and Fallout 76 is here to stay and to get even better with time!
---
????
---
Yeh your right. I'll just keep my eyes out for other players until I learn where the stash boxes are. Thanks for the helpful advice.
---
Because they want to hate.
---
Nothing more, logic goes out the window when you just want to shit on something
---
But that's only physical right?
---
Screw 'em. They probably think Anthem is going somewhere.
---
Also someone just posted about an article on Bethesda‚Äôs site that says only your appearance and special points carry over. So you‚Äôre description survival does not apply.
---
Exactly, I mentioned this in a similar post, theyre introducing some unique elements to the BR
---
Perfect, that gives plenty of time to test it first! Thanks!
---
How far in the future is Wastelanders
---
I like to bring that up whenever youtubers come up a new upcoming P2W thing that is 100% going to be added in any day now that everybody should immediately lose their minds over right now before its too late.
---
Yea. 3 4 and new Vegas.
---
Nah it's my friends, they're really beating a dead horse going on about how I'm a dumbass for purchasing a game that went from worse to 'even more worse' because they announced BR, and think this game is now a BR game.
---
My thoughts exactly
---
By that logic, every game in the past decade is a steal. Doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôll actually live up to expectations. Although, I just saw the e3 trailers. I‚Äôm sure that 76 will be very much worth what I paid for it when wastelanders comes out
---
Ill see you there fern &gt;:D
---
And tnt on the right
---
My gt is LordOfApalachia I‚Äôm on Xbox I‚Äôll be in a pvp server in a little bit come join
---
Ty
---
Great news! You actually arent required to play, you can just.. wait for it.. not click the fucking game mode in the menu
---
Itll get a bit worse when all the youtubers put ‚Äúfallout goes free to play‚Äù as the headline this week, stay strong bro
---
This is the most r/gamingcirclejerk comment I think I‚Äôve ever seen
---
Really wish survival was like this
---
I'm guessing it'll be like a beta type deal? Maybe only available to try out this week so they can get some early feedback and stuff.
---
Bro, you just posted cringe. You are going to lose karma.
---
Nope, it‚Äôs 79. New vault probably near toxic valley as we don‚Äôt have a vault near that region. Also, their was lore that a kids parents from the quest in the water park left to a nearby vault. Maybe we‚Äôll get to see them exit the vault if it‚Äôs full of NPCs
---
I have to say,I'm beyond impressed at this,alone just with npcs in the game,and my ever changing outlook on PVP,the storm looks minty af! Get ur builds up boys and girls,it's gonna get wilds in the wastelands after,what will be a massive update.
---
Don‚Äôt feel bad, I wanted to toss the controller at first when I realized there was no keypad or anything on the outside lmao. Wasn‚Äôt until I saw someone else do it that I was like, oh snap! :P
---
Did you get up and walk away for the fo76 reveals or something?
---
I‚Äôve suspected for a long time that they would add NPCs to the game, but I honestly didn‚Äôt know how they would pull it off. While I‚Äôm still curious about the specifics, I do think it‚Äôs brilliant from a story telling perspective how they are bringing the NPCs in. It also gives me a lot of hope that they could significantly change areas of the game over time due to this new aspect of the story, eventually creating a player hub location officially aside from the Whitesprings. I would LOVE to see a city forming full of NPCs where we can go to get quests, trigger events and encounter the type of ‚Äúunique‚Äù characters Fallout does so well. Fingers crossed
---
I‚Äôve actually gotten 2 Gauss Rifles (both one star) from Flooded Train Yard but the times were very, very far from one another.
---
It doesn't matter what they say. I learned back in December, if someone wants to call you a shill, they're gonna no matter how much you try to have a dialogue. "Bethesdrone" is the ad hom of choice and if enjoying a few of their games makes me one, so be it.
---
Playstation, lol. So you wanna show me your bloodied/invisible camper build? Nice skill dude, well rather skill cards than real skill but still a nice one
---
There are counters I told you what they where. Get a better build or don‚Äôt do pvp it‚Äôs very easy to avoid it in this game
---
They put a video of how itll work, I think its on their youtube now
---
Who cares what they think? If you enjoy the game then awesome. If not, play something else.
---
Pretty cheesy if you ask me
---
man, am gonna.miss oit on this one
---
Looks like the plasma caster is back too! Check out the guy at the end in the fall trailer
---
I think it‚Äôs pretty cool but now there‚Äôs 2 modes people that don‚Äôt PvP won‚Äôt play so I‚Äôm sure more limits will be put in place for Adventure mode.
---
51 is gonna be battle Royale. 2 of the other vaults are gonna be raids during nuclear winter. That leaves 1 more vault in the game. Wonder what they are gonna do with that one that they has to make another.
---
Who cares? Tell em to suck it, lol. You aren't a sheep; you make your own decisions and you like what you like. It's a freaking great game.
---
why would we just now get dwellers from our vault? makes sense to have them come from a distant vault.
---
Well, I hope this works as intended. I'll give it a try at least.
---
Without a doubt its related to the Plasma caster
---
I though i needed 5 so i killed 5. and Lvl 3 Butcher's Bounty was 5/5 for me.
---
Gee I can't wait for people to wait and see instead of shitting their pants right now regarding the new game mode.
---
Yeah I would venture over there if it was. I really feel like survival is strictly to reduce griefing  in adventure. If you just want to get OP gear and kill noobs go there. Adventure is for regular players.
---
&gt;[I don't know what the hell that thing was.](https://i.imgur.com/VNFiYIh.png)
---
Oh sweet Jesus fuck someone burn it. 
---
Really though. Looks like some terrifying new Centaur.
---
I guess I‚Äôll try it just to say I did. But I‚Äôm not looking forward to it. Unfortunately they looked beyond stoked to introduce this. I hope they can change my mind about this.
---
I like it all except the royale...
---
Yep, wonder if it'll use microfusion cells, or plasma cores.
---
Yeah, so you agree - neither of us know for certain what the finances are like/what the potential extra revenue will be for them. So why are you obsessed with shooting it down? 
---
I didn't say that people would buy the game **just** for BR mode, but having a BR mode on top of the core game will 
---
A. Get the attention of players who aren't familiar with FO series, but are into BR games
---
B. Serve players who are already playing FO76 and would like to see a BR mode (yes, they exist)
---
Man I almost screamed like a little girl when they announced Human NPC's
---
lol wtf is this
---
This something happened to me but I lowkey feel like they were stashing them because they were out of the way and not on any direct path but hey, they were there and I took them. *shrug*
---
It‚Äôs vault 79
---
I do not think I could care less if I become the most downvoted comment on /r/fo76.
---
This game is becoming worse with every passing quarter. I have lost faith Bethesda will ever create another worthy game. Starfield will probably be a complete joke and a creator's club points cash cow with disabled mods etc.
---
Fuck this studio to be honest.
---
They‚Äôll name it ‚ÄúPrototype Hellfire‚Äù
---
Wait... everybody's favourite Winchester P94??? ***YES***
---
ITS 50% OFF ON PSN AND FREE FROM TOMORROW TO THE 17TH
---
They better bring papa centaur back üò©üôè
---
Thats a me
---
BETHESDA BAD
---
CPDR GOOD
---
SAME I JUST KEPT SQUEALING
---
The fuck are you going on about?  The terrible pvp meta is entirely dependant on people grinding for god rolled legendary gear to reach ridiculous amounts of special bonuses and/or damage mitigation, did you seriously think they would either let people carry that shit over into a battle royale or that even IF there were legendary gear in the mode people would be able to farm for shit in the first place?
---
Google ‚ÄúDuffy Fallout 76 guide‚Äù it has quite a few great walkthroughs.
---
You clearly don't get the point of pvp overall. Balance is needed to allow players to choose different playstyles, not to make them avoid it, that's lost content, for players and bethesda. When argumenting someone please try to be neutral rather than only defending what YOU like. It's a game for all kinds of players, and most of them don't like crouching on rocks waiting for enemies to come by. Fallout has an excellent gun gameplay, way too good to only sit still and autoaim your weapon
---
Ty!
---
Oh still I am super excited this game will be the best RPG around at the end of 2019
---
Wastelanders is about what I expected and was hoping for, nice. Wonder how much time has passed.
---
Very cool. Look forward to getting to level 500 with all this content coming.
---
Flat space is hard to come by, you found yourself the peaceful jackpot of land.  Pretty helpful if you decide to send a nuke out, just head on down to nuke-launchy town.
---
Is that what we're getting? Another PVP mode.
---
real friends wouldnt call you a dumbass for liking a game might want to rethink your cricle
---
I am super psyched
---
Most I've done at once was 5 or 6. I didn't intend to but I was roaming around and kept getting over loaded so when I'd get to one I'd take it just so I could build a workbench and stashbox to lighten my load. I haven't even gotten around taking all 20 of them separately yet.
---
yeah
---
Thats gonna be a brave cosplay.
---
I think it‚Äôs gonna be bad ass. I really don‚Äôt enjoy BR anymore; they are just boring now. But Bethesda‚Äôs take on a BR really interest me. Maybe it was just the trailer though. It looks like it‚Äôs gonna be really good.
---
Agreed!
---
I want the recharger pistol it could for when you just started a new character
---
The BR mode will likely be like any other battle Royale and you'll start from nothing.
---
Just realized probably, welp I hate how slow my internt is, Hate living in the middle of nowhere
---
I agree NW looks like an interesting take on BR modes. But honestly, unless they have somerhing good for the main mode I will probably take a bit of a break for part of NW. Wastelanders looks interesting. Sadly I havent been able to watch the main event, going to wait till its up later tonight on youtube.
---
Agreed, this community really is awesome at its core.
---
I was under the impression they aren‚Äôt from a vault.
---
i play every few weeks and I haven't really noticed any considerable changes. It's still painfully boring. Who knows, maybe the NPCs will add a little life, but BR is just utter bottom level of desperation from Bethesda's absolutely failed product.
---
Yup, was revealed at Bethesda's E3, 52 player battle royale.
---
I don't understand the question.
---
Yeah it seems like theyre properly fallout-ing the mode with a vault tie in and an insane AI. Could be interesting if they do co op stuff as well. But ultimately i have no interest in PVP.
---
Imagine coming to a subreddit about a game you don't like just to shit on it.
---
God how pathetic.
---
Just play the game. Spend your early days in the forest gathering resources (exp, guns, ammo, armor, plans, supplies, locations). There's a lot to explore there. You're ready to venture out into new territory when the main quest takes you there, and once there, spend time and explore it. A primary objective would be to choose what weapon(s) you want to use and if you want to utilize power armor--this will help you with your build/perk card allotment. And of course, a little homework can go a long way!
---
Wow what a read. I guess at least you get exactly what you deserve.
---
What is actually coming out tomorrow?
---
It's the 9th. Assume they are going by Bethesda time.
---
I was going to lay that out in my previous comment, but thought it was a bit harsh how I originally typed it. 
---
But, yeah; that‚Äôs it. People are just driven to hate the game at any cost. Literally crying about a game mode they don‚Äôt need to play, while shrugging off all the content they have been bitching about being absent at launch.
---
I think the concern that is being voiced by some has more to do with the perception that new potentially toxic players will be drawn to this mode, than the actual inclusion of a new game type.
---
While I do not fully agree, having played since Beta, I did notice once PVP survival mode was launched that the number of asshats* in PVE was reduced dramatically, so in my experience there is a correlation.
---
*asshats= players that intentionally ruin the enjoyment of other players games by griefing, message spamming, base destroying (no long an issue), or engage in unwarranted harassing behavior.
---
same principals from those games. enjoy the scenery, story and opportunities to interact with other real people. 
---
  don't sell your junk and make sure to scrap it before placing it in your camp inventory (all stash containers have a shared inventory and max weight of 800)
---
  always have plenty of water, food and meds. check all the weight of everything you carry. make sure all your weapons and gear are in good condition and you have plenty of ammo before heading out of a safe area. be creative when building your camp and  above all else HAVE FUN!! see you in the wastes fresh meat
---
I'm not a big PVPer, but I'm kinda excited about the BR mode. Wastelanders looks amazing too.
---
I definitely would have preferred just PvE content, but considering that we're seeing some PvE inside the mode, whatever. Looks different enough.
---
Only weapons and ammo, and I have heavy weapon and ammo/explosives cards equipped.
---
I played 76 since launch and still playing it. I prob going to stay away from the BR mode
---
Ty vry much fern
---
I love helping all the new people out of the vault lol that‚Äôs why I sell all of my stuff from regardless of price for dirty cheap right outside of Flatwoods
---
I would fully expect 76 to go offline tomorrow morning for maintenance to introduce the nuclear winter stuff.
---
"VATS only works on AI"
---
Exactly how it should be! Now put that in survival mode.
---
Don't play it like an MMO, play it as if it were another Fallout game sans NPCs. Also, logs on the ground can be used to get wood scraps.
---
Ring a ding ring baby.
---
Exactly.  The addition of the mutant hounds attacking in the trailer immediately made me perk up.  Being forced to team up to survive some bigger shit, only to have to turn around after and kill each other looks really fucking cool.  I hope it pans out like that.
---
Yeah man. You right.
---
This is verified, as with the cross post.
---
Dude, don't you get it? It's BR. Even being remotely connected to a BR mean that you have a connection to Fortnite. And as we all know, Fortnite is the spawn of the devil itself, Epic Games, who killed our families and stole all of out money! ^^/s
---
Make sure you enable / turn on PACIFIST mode, so you dont accidently flag yourself for PVP.
---
Once i heard about the battle royale possibly coming to fallout 76 i was wishing it wouldn‚Äôt be off track of fallout genre
---
[This is it](https://youtu.be/Ir7cRRiVGjw?t=96)
---
The same ones downvoting here are probably the ones cheering loudest.
---
If they add a Team Rumble and let the person with highest score as overseer I'd be ok with that.
---
Free trial access and I believe the nuclear winter stuff starts
---
I'm so glad I came here after watching with a twitch channel. Fuck it was depressing to see everyone just shitting on the game and well Bethesda in general. It's like people hate them with all their gut. It's crazy. Nice to come here and be excited with others who are equally excited. Can't stand the constant shitting on Bethesda and fo76.
---
Yeah, I mean part of Nuclear Winter will have Vault Raids with Vault 94 and 96 according to their road map so I guess they might do Vaults 51, 94 and 96 opening in the same update.
---
Makes me wonder about 63 though.
---
Wonder what the excuses will be now for hating on Fallout 76 since "it's not the same without human NPCs" will be lost.
---
I imagine it will just be trolls that are angry about battle royale.
---
It‚Äôs barely the right place but NPC‚Äôs ARE COOL.
---
Oh wow, a game released that wasn't finished? Duh, every video game does it now.
---
Can we get that doom axe in fallout?! That looks doooope
---
This would be great, and could be integrated into some sort of guest book feature at our personal terminals. I‚Äôd love to get feedback on my vending prices, and thoughts on my camp design
---
I saw the new trailer. Wow npc‚Äôs!!!!
---
Didn‚Äôt think it would happen. Like the decision factor. Just like real life. Looks like fun!!!
---
I think the NW stuff is essentially a beta, don't think it's perma-launching. But not certain.
---
Oh on ps4
---
I posted a few times before that I wanted battle royale in fo76 and everybody acted like assholes and treated me like shit. I knew it would be cool and it does look cool in the trailer. You fucking guys lack imagination. I don't. I think battle royale will be great in FO76 and I think it'll bring a lot of life and new players. Now FO76 is finally worth buying for me.
---
I am still a bit conflicted but I may give it a try.  Maybe.  Based on that trailer, it seems like the only usable gear is stuff you pick up in that game mode which I like.  I was initially worried that it would be like Survival where everyone just uses TSE weapons.  I just really hope they fine tune the PvP and make it an even playing field otherwise Nuclear Winter is a no-go for me.
---
What really sucks about all of the good news about Wastelanders... is that Bethesda is likely going to get zero credit for any of it with the media.  Eventually introducing human npc's could have been their plan from day one but when the youtubers eventually sink their teeth into this it's more likely to be something to the tune of "those dumb fucks at Bethesda finally caved in and realized having no npcs was stupid"
---
I live in Dallas and Am stoked they work here. great post thank you!
---
Uh, no. Bethesda will be king of gaming again once ES6 releases.
---
Damn right on all counts by me!
---
sorry, i meant is that all we‚Äôre getting for nuclear winter
---
I doubt they would open them all at once. Most likely they will stagger it with each one being harder than the last.
---
lol wat?
---
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT THING
---
I think its around 50.
---
I mean besides the obvious ADDING OF NPCS, Wastelanders is going to sweet.
---
It's an ingredient to what nightmares are made of
---
Fall 2019
---
The fact that the NPCs are..."returning" is an odd selling point but I'm not one to hate! This is worth getting excited for.
---
Wastelanders is exactly how I was hoping they'd implement human NPCs, I'm so glad. And the BR mode looks pretty good too!
---
Nope. Just a waste of time and resources.
---
Shut up
---
I'm not a BR fan at all really, but this looks like a fun enough spin on the concept to be something I'll at the very least try. Plus, I doubt all Nuclear Winter will be is this one game mode.
---
Clever bird, all part of a large ongoing story line, have faith
---
Sell it at your camp super cheap eventually someone will buy it.
---
leave it for some noobs at the overseers camp...
---
A troll on his burner trying to be funny lol
---
No I meant in Fallout 76 time line. Is it a week,a month or a year after Vault 76 opens up?
---
"We had a lot of difficulties at launch and got some well-deserved criticism" 
---
"But the team kept working on it and you kept playing it."
---
"We made a post apocalyptic Survival game where you could do whatever you want and everybody's nice to each other. They don't go on killing sprees they leave food and water for the newbies and wave to each other. I don't know about you but this should give us all hope for humanity when the apocalypse does come."
---
*last one kills me
---
Meh twitter
---
Ok, sure. I'll believe any of this.
---
More paid astroturfing of this subreddit, fucking awesome.
---
I know. That was noticeable though. Also does it have a hot rod paint on it?
---
It looked like it. That was the plane parked out front. I wonder how this will effect where we can place our CAMPs.
---
1000%
---
&gt;  And who cares if no-one will play it after 2-3 weeks?
---
Because they spent time developing it, time that could have been spent making something that **will** be played for longer than 2-3 weeks.
---
That said, maybe it won't be a flop, the trailer for it looked pretty slick so maybe the gameplay will be good enough to keep people coming back to the mode.
---
PRAISE GERALDO AMIRITE MY FELLOW /r/GAMING USERS
---
Oh would you look at that?? NPC's and dialogue options!!! Guess they're adding singler player style quests too. Cool shit
---
Why not? I already have a slave collar with its flashing red light in the front. I might as well have a backpack with a flashing red light on my back.
---
I mean, I would consider the Encryptid questline pretty cool, and Player Vending made this game feel 1000 times more alive. While yes, adding a BR mode is just following a big trend, it's not like you have ever played it yet. You just seem to blindly hate on anything that has to with a BR, dude.
---
Lol people love circlejerking CDPR
---
Some sweet rewards though, perks and cosmetics. I‚Äôll save judgment for when it comes out
---
I don‚Äôt know that I will play it often, but I‚Äôll give it a try and thankfully it‚Äôs available for people that are into that. Whatever keeps the game alive is fine with me. And who knows, given the differences it will have with mainstream br maybe us players that are turned off to br might actually enjoy it. Just keeping my mind open.
---
Like some of the others have said: Fuck 'em. BF and I play 76 a lot and we're pretty excited from what we saw tonight. We also know that, as players, we've experienced this game's growth and improvement first hand.
---
One of our friends is like your friends. He tries to slide in little remarks, and tries to make it *sound* like he's not being a little fucker, but he is. You can see it, y'know?  He briefly reads clickbait headlines on Youtube and other journalists, and thinks that's it. They must be right. Clearly they are, because it's everywhere!  He's riding the hate train because that's basically the in thing to do still. The people still making fun of it now are the people who were making fun of it at launch, too, and haven't even remotely looked into it's improvements, and don't plan to. Because being hateful is more fun/"cool" to do.
---
OMG FUCKING FINALLY
---
I hope the game doesn't feel as empty now. 
---
This is turning into the game I've always wanted.
---
Besides the fact that it's so glitchy and crash happy?  There's nothing to hate.
---
I expect that. Yeah
---
Anyone know when we can play this exactly?
---
How is the most demanded feature in the game an odd selling point?
---
thanks, on xbox. 
---
I think I can build them, haven't checked yet but pretty sure I can
---
. I guess I just wrongly assumed the plans were out there for the various mods for them and was surprised to not find a single thing after much searching.
---
I‚Äôve never played a br and don‚Äôt even know why it‚Äôs own thing, isn‚Äôt it just some kinda PVP arena match?
---
Interesting! Have you tried it around Berkeley Springs West or Dolly Sod's? looks like you can get a decent amount of all 5 types of flux around there.
---
https://i.imgur.com/RHVAeS3.png
---
https://i.imgur.com/HWboyPi.png
---
I will try it out.
---
This is the first time these have ever been in a game I think? Praise Todd!!!
---
I love playing different weapons and I use alot of ammo, so it's good to use different types of ammo so I never run out of it and I can still do a sbq and shoot 30mins without a break without it hurting my reserves. I also only have gunsmith 3 so I need more for the case that one breaks, queen eats them, especially when combined with balistic bock
---
I agree, and glad im not the only one that thought this same thing.
---
‚ÄúI think we‚Äôll get something the size of a regular Fallout DLC‚Äôs worth of NPCs and a few quests, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to satisfy for very long. I think everyone wanted 76 to be Fallout 5 with multiplayer, and it‚Äôll never be that.‚Äù
---
West Tek has outdone themselves
---
Does this mean that Wastelanders is going to be a traditional fallout-style campaign or are the NPCs going to be more like the ones from MMORPGs?
---
Oh damn I didn't see that!!
---
I'm going to play it but he actually does have to to get the skins so your wrong and maybe don't be suck an ass
---
It's tied to your levels earned through the BR, and you [get some XP just for time survived](https://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/4bOeNrmeVFlwIxhzByKIgk/02b072c0f88ab7ad7e4ef229795343ad/F76_NW_Match_Summary_in-body_960x540.jpg). So while not optimal, I'm sure you can get every reward just by playing the mode a lot even if you're not a big PvPer.
---
I‚Äôm asking for someone to get on my ps4 account and level me up on fallout 76 while I‚Äôm gone
---
Im with the Settlers all the way i cannot wait!
---
I'm not obsessed with shooting it down. I just don't care about it, and I'm pretty sure most people who play BR games care even less. So I'm not saying it should be shot down, I'm just betting that it will either be down by itself by BGS because of lack of rentability or substantially reduce the amount of dedicated servers in maybe 9 months. I'm even going to say that more people will be playing more daily Skyrim than this BR mode by August of this year.  Also, people nowadays really hate on BRs so I don't know...
---
But dude, I'm just worried by the future but heck yeah I'm gonna spam the fuck out of this game mode when it releases and I bet you'll have lots of fun too. I'm just saying that it isn't adding basically nothing to the longevity of the game and that I'm pretty sure that focusing on other things (like Wastelanders) would've help this game in every possible way. Have a nice evening :)
---
Worse thing ever to do would be giving access to your PS4 account to someone you don't know...
---
That said, I‚Äôm hopeful it‚Äôs a decent amount of content that‚Äôll keep us all happy for a hundred hours and beyond. I root for the game, but I know the reality of the resources it would take to make it as big as people really want it to be.
---
I think it‚Äôs suppose to me more humans are returning. Everyone died out from the scorched plague. Now that there is a cure people can come back. That or year two says we defeated the scorched and the plague so no need to pass out the cure.
---
Haaaaaa
---
I think the problem would be having the server handle 52 player's stashes and camps, and keeping track of all of the mobs and stuff that they're killing.  The battle royale will most certainly have less server strain because they don't have to track so much.
---
Yea but you were right about wastelanders! NPCs and it looked like some sort of faction based decisions or something!
---
Okay. That hud is fucking sick.
---
It‚Äôs my 3rd account
---
Oh yeah I‚Äôve found this. It‚Äôs funny.
---
look at me i dont like this game, im cool and edgy
---
Picture the scene, your in your camp reaping I. The spoils of war as you have completely obliterated an enemy team and then in the distance, faint music what you can almost make out as ring of fire, you pay no notice to it and continue to loot but it grows ever closer and you begin to suspect its a bad omen, and that's when it happens. The deafening chorus can be heard all around you as you look up to see the towering wall of flames edging towards you at breakneck speeds, you try to run yet your efforts are met with face melting heat and all you hard work gone "in the ring of fire"
---
I‚Äôm level 256 on my main
---
What are the chances that this game goes back up to $45\~60?  With all the NPC hype, it wouldn't be a bad idea.
---
Made of canvas.
---
There are no builds that are anywhere close to being difficult to kill.  Standing up in Sentinel is a death sentence in PvP and the fact that you used these as evidence that pvp is broken tells me how little you understand about it.  I mean no offence but I see this written here all the time and it is very inaccurate.  Then other people here read it and believe it to be true.   You can remove sentinel, cavalier, bloodied, all explosive effects, anti armor, the list goes on and it won‚Äôt make any difference because the TTK is extremely short with nearly any weapon if it fits the build.  Every player has access to the exact same perk cards.  Sacrificing QOL cards for damage, damage mitigation is key here.  You are responsible for your own survival.  Choose your cards accordingly. 
---
As an aside:
---
The real broken items are explosive lasers and Gatling plasmas.  They‚Äôre fun but too powerful and take the fun out of pvp.  
---
Automatic tesla rifles take no skill as they can shoot around corners and automatically arc to targets - but they probably work as intended and range is limited so I‚Äôm not sure much if anything needs to be done about them.  Currently very OP though.
---
Wastelanders? Very good
---
Nuclear Winter? Bad, very very bad
---
So you get Perk Cards when you play it? Or am I misunderstanding you?
---
Cough Hellfire cough cough
---
Well, I'm a lot more intrigued by a battle royale mode in Fallout 76 than I thought I'd be.  If I don't like it, I'm free to pretend it never exists.
---
#FO1/2 PLASMA RIFLE
---
#***LET'S GO***
---
The dude in the middle also appears to have some new kind of gun. Maybe a Wattz laser gun? And the guy with the plasma career looks like he has some raider-fied X-01.
---
The definition is basically a fight to the death. However many players start the fight eventually it comes down to a 1v1 (or 4v4 if it‚Äôs a team mode) for the winner. It‚Äôs not my preferred game mode but I will say on the rare occasion I‚Äôve played br it‚Äôs so satisfying to win. :)
---
You're a cynical one, aren't you?
---
Looked a bit like the dead monster in lucky hole mine
---
One question, what is wrong with the battle royale? 
---
It‚Äôs not forced and it‚Äôs free. Who cares?
---
I can't speak for everyone, but the reason I'm against BR is I absolutely hate the gameplay of that kind of game, it's not fun whatsoever to me. Also it's wasted devlopment time tacking on a gamemode that is not fun rather than adding actually fun content to the main game.
---
To simplify it, it wasted development time and resources to make something boring rather than something fun.
---
Sorry man im on ps4 but yeah you get mods from scrapping them
---
Fuck yes. Wastelanders will be brilliant!
---
Sounded like the same dude that covered Country Roads
---
What a time to reroll out of 15 INT. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
Lol. you're pathetic.
---
oh yeah that's fine. I'm not hating on them adding a BR it's just I'm tired if the whole thing entirely. To each their own my friends don't let the hate keep you from playing whatever you want to play
---
[Fall-ish](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019). Although with how they've been dropping stuff so far, wouldn't be surprised if they start leading into it sooner than that.
---
It will work the same way robots work, they‚Äôre NPCs, just not flesh and bones.
---
I hope the battlecoat can also be bought with existing atoms, cause $15AUD is a lot when you're already stocked up on atoms and don't use repair kits.
---
Imagine a King Radscorpion, an Alpha Sheepsquach, and the Queen Scorchbeast fighting for dominance.
---
I'd watch that fight.
---
Free trial tomorrow sometime
---
It doesn‚Äôt have any personal info on it or money or credit cards
---
I sell ammo at 1c, it sells from time to time,
---
Do we know if Wastelanders will still have online players, or will it become a more transitional game? I'd be fine with either tbh
---
A preview for a week
---
Free trial week was clearly published as June 10th to June 17th.
---
well, from what i have seen the new human NPC's will be from outside west virginia.. so maybe some of them came from other vaults, but their land was even more lousy?
---
I look forward to kicking it‚Äôs ass. 
---
If it had one. 
---
If not, I‚Äôm chopping those legs off!!!ü§†
---
Seems like it'll be riddled with bugs and probably unbalanced at first. But it certainly looks fun. I think a huge part of why they are improving combat was this game mode
---
Human npcs and an organic progression to the main story?! YES!!!
---
I‚Äôm also excited for battle royale but I hate pvp. My hope is it will open up survival mode for those of us who like the way it‚Äôs set up but avoid it bc of the disappointing way pvp was implemented. If most of the pvp enthusiasts head to nuclear winter then I‚Äôll be very happy.
---
I wish they would just quit the stupid PvP aspect for good and focus on fixing all the bugs in the game people do care about. No one except a few ass hat griefers and trolls asked for this or wanted this.
---
I predict this gameplay mode will be totally unplayed a few months after release. I HOPE it fails too. This does not bode well for fo5.
---
I honestly don't care about Battle Royale and it disappoints me they focused so much on it as a concept.
---
HUMAN FUCKING NPC'S YESSSSSüòç ALL THEY NEED NOW IS A RADIO HOST AND WE SETTT
---
WAS THAT A SWAMP APE?!?!?
---
Some of them just want to give you something for having a nice stocked vending machine. Other might want to see what you personally have which is usually better than what you have in the vending machine.
---
So like early access?
---
I hadn't considered that. Good point.
---
I mean, would Fallout really be Fallout if it weren't glitchy though? Would Skyrim still be Skyrim if Trolls didn't launch you into the upper stratosphere?
---
Not a pro, just someone that can read files and see skyrim bits in fallout 76
---
&gt; The only thing that sort of makes me want to play it is the perk cards,  and some of them transferring over (I believe that only 10 don‚Äôt carry  to Adventure). 
---
I'm a bit confused by this since they also state in the same article that:
---
&gt; You will also earn Perk cards by increasing your Overseer rank, but any  Perks unlocked in Nuclear Winter are exclusive to that mode and do not  carry over. 
---
Like what's going on? Will the new perks just be selectable on level up in Adventure mode?
---
what about the hellfire pa tho
---
Yea that's the new power armor skins for the DLC. They look like raider af they just released the nuclear winter trailer and shows off the new skin
---
Hopeful, excited!
---
The sun is going to shine and. Im Still going to play fallout no matter what people say or how much they hate.
---
I drink my own kool-aid, they can have theirs
---
Not to be an ass, but they saw how the community reacted to Hello Games with No Man's Sky and how it generated sales and changed perception. 
---
Still i have been a fan of this game and series from the start and love all of the games. This game is in my top 5 easily with the likes of NMS, Elite Dangerous, Conan Exiles, and Monster Hunter World. I will need to change it to top 10 with Cyberpunk 2077 coming and i can then add that with the witcher series.
---
Anyway im rambling. I love this game and will keep with it for as long as i am able to keep playing it.
---
No I meant in fallout timeline lmao,like a month or a year after Vault 76 opens
---
I didn‚Äôt realize that. That‚Äôs what a lot of people have been saying, that it was bad at he beginning which is when I played and then after a lot of fixes and improvements it‚Äôs a lot better. I stopped playing and following the game before that point so I didn‚Äôt know
---
do you have a moment to talk about that juicy hellfire PA?
---
Mario?
---
Coming in a few weeks I guess
---
You were the one in Hell that needed Their help to be redeemed.
---
Hoping that the weapons and power armor are just added in and aren't walled behind the gamemide
---
Yes.
---
I am so thrilled for wastelanders, not so much for nuclear winter. Does being overseer mean anything? Will there be post-play after the battle royale? Will it be like a seperate game mode like survival? 
---
Will their be a level cap? Will we be bringing in our own gear or will it drop gear in that game mode?
---
Who caaaaaaaares.
---
I could be mistaken but something I heard recently was if youre not doing at minimum 2% overall damage to her, you get nothing.
---
:D
---
Im under a bridge outside Morgantown. Its cramped but i like it. I may move but honestly not sure.
---
I dont want to know what it is and I hope I never encounter it
---
Your comment didn‚Äôt age well...
---
Same has been happening to me and my friend.
---
Looks like the crashed space station is getting an update.
---
https://gfycat.com/selfishinfantilecuscus
---
Glad about that because I was bummed that there isn't a lot there currently.
---
 Butchers bounty and the better with salt perk help a lot.  But your right. All that work and spent ammo and you get jack üò®
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019  still summer 2019 like the roadmap says... so; soon.
---
Same here, really glad they went this route.
---
Still don't care what anyone says. The other day at a insurance firm I was helping a woman and she had a bunch of fallout stuff at her desk. All I said was "76?" And she hesitated. Then I said, "I have it, still play it and love it." Then we had a good conversation about how we hate it when people shit on it.
---
I don't care for it. All I hope, is that it's not a server wide event, where players that don't want to participate would have to find new servers.
---
Said no one else. Ever. 
---
Battle Royale is the most stupid and idiotic thing I've ever heard of.
---
If anything this new mode will bring the kind of trash to the game that was filtered out when adventure mode made player bases invincible. Good luck finding 51 other 12 year old to play with you.
---
I certainly hope so man, honestly aside from content, I probably want that more
---
They literally address all that in the articles linked in the post
---
Check my post history, FFS I list a couple of them so it's not like it's hard.
---
Yes and no.
---
Previously you didnt have to worry about being disconnected from a server while you were knee deep in a questline etc.
---
Reminds me of a centaur for pure "Oh, fuck no"ness
---
As long as they stuff is specific to the game mode and doesn't force people to play it to unlock something in adventure mode, I'm okay. I'd rather they not waste dev time on a seperate mode, but I'm okay.
---
Bringing up eldritch horror is interesting! Maybe it has something to do with the interloper?
---
Dead? That things **moves** if you look at it carefully!
---
People are stuck in an outrage cycle..
---
Yeah that piece of shit is ungodly
---
Didn't really want human NPCs to return but the trailer made it look so bad ass that I'm kinda hyped for it.
---
Kinda makes sense with the story. Radio from Rose maybe getting news out? To me it makes sense. Maybe some people came to see if it was better. Pretty cool imo too.
---
It almost felt like we couldn't say that at launch without been shat on for thinking that there was still NPCs aplenty. Rose and Biv are some of my favourites from all of the Fallout games because they have personalities.
---
It's not always about quantity.
---
Well, your going to be forced to play that gamemode even if you hate it just to get the cosmetic you like. (And possibly even unique perk cards only obtainable from it. (The artical both said you CAN bring perk cards back earned in the mode, and you can't in the same page. So I assume an idiot wrote it, question is which of that idiot's multiple personalities is correct.
---
without butcher's bount don't even try guys.
---
Wish I found reddit when I was level 9 lol
---
&gt;The real broken items are explosive lasers and Gatling plasma
---
I have 2 legacy explosive lasers so I know they're broken
---
Now as to why I made the claims I did, I will tell you about the last time I PVP'd. 2 players, both in their 70's while I'm 160+( I have my build done) I spent 2 full fusions cores of my TSE Gatling lasers on them, non stop shooting except the reload and I physically couldn't damage them. They both had hit me first so it was legit PVP. Their health would not drop at all for most of the time I shot and when it did it just went right back up. They had unyielding Sentinel armor on with bloodied weapons( I talked to them after) so explain that.
---
Well, I for one do it so that I can negotiate if I want a high priced item, or think something is overpriced.
---
Every time I‚Äôve said ‚Äúhey man, can I make an offer on X item?‚Äù It‚Äôs been verbally accepted, and a trade happens.
---
Your stuff isn‚Äôt selling because it‚Äôs overpriced.
---
Nuclear Winter probably won't have stashes.
---
Though I saw a standard stash box in the video...
---
I reaaaaaallly hope Wastelanders is single player
---
No. 
---
It's just promotional music for a trailer.
---
It's 2 water every 2 minute. So yeah, 60.
---
this kind of thing is the reason i purposely put my camp in the middle of the map and in in the middle of the wilderness so that i could minimize the chance of new content pushing me off my land.
---
If I read it correctly it said there were 73 new perk cards and 10 of them didn‚Äôt carry over.  If I read it incorrectly I‚Äôm sorry.  Let me find the exact quote.
---
Yeah this E3 thing didn't really cover a single damn thing of importance details-wise did it? It was just announcing what we already knew + showing a few guns and npcs comming down the line.
---
I finally bought 76 this weekend and am hooked! So psyched for this announcement!
---
Got one from a ghoul in white springs once
---
Not a fan of BRs but looks legit and it unlocks new gear? I‚Äôm game.
---
Lol
---
I had the same problem as well.
---
Undeleted
---
Last time I came to this post and asked how things were going and if it got better I got massively downvoted and decided not to try the game again. Literally all I did last time was asked if the server crashes got better becuz when I played it in opening couple weeks it was horrible (the bugs never bothered me much). 
---
Now im tempted again with this new E3 news. So, Hopefully I just had a one off experience and the community is nicer and has open arms to the new players coming in!
---
https://bethesda.net/en/article/4f9q90xXpnRJ8vlIWVJxVK/fallout-76-nuclear-winter-is-coming
---
Theres basically BR specific perks that are attached to that mode only, one is for jumping higher, another is weapon weight reduction etc
---
His mom probably caught him watching Fortnite porn and banned him from playing the game. So now he has a hate boner for BR that rivals Cell's hate boner for Tien.
---
Ultimately, he doesn't realize that cashing in on a game style that is still pretty popular is a good idea from a business perspective, and nothing is forcing those who dislike battle Royale modes to play it. Don't like it? Don't play it. No need to shit on things just because other people like it. Right?
---
I for one hate BR, but shit. I'll give this one a fair chance and if I don't like it? I'll just not play it again. Or I'll get dragged into it by friends who love it and then hate myself for not having enough of a back bone to say no. Haha.
---
No - lucky hole's knees bend differently, different head, and tentacles.
---
Really looks like a more cryptid-like variant of something like the cerberus to me. Similar to a snallygaster in some ways too, so I'm expecting an FEV-related monster.
---
I REALLY should‚Äôve mentioned in my post that I don‚Äôt have a microphone. This would all be a non-issue if I had one.
---
I prefer downloads, but thanks anyway :)
---
What about camp decorating? 
---
100 day road map -"use items from your stash to decorate your camp"
---
Also will we be getting a build space increase with this?
---
holy shit i would be ecstatic if the scorched were taken out of the game and replaced with actual human raiders when this launches.
---
hi, that would be me!
---
or rather, I went to look to see if I could start the download now for the trial, saw it was on sale, and said "screw it" and just bought it. finally.
---
I've been going back and forth since launch. not so much a fallout 76 problem, but more of a "i've never played an online game where there's other people in my world" issue. i hesitantly started WoW two weeks ago, and everyone I've met there has surprisingly been so nice. so i'm really hoping I run into nice people like you guys!
---
Nice charlie's, give em a shake for the Ben-man.
---
"Unique Companions" :o
---
Nice. The AR is my favorite gun aesthetically so I'm trying to get as top tier of one I can get. What I really want is like a quad explosive or faster fire rate so it can be a pseudo lmg for me. I just love the old school look of it with the drum mag
---
This what kind of makes me wonder what the canon story be now for why no one goes to Appalachia anymore during the events of FO3 and FO4. Before it was thought because the scorched. But with humans returning? There has to be another reason now
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning)
---
Remember wastelander is coming this fall, that's not the game now. No npcs. 
---
The perk system can be confusing. You're told to pick a perk then a perk card. Even though the card selection defaults to the special you just picked you don't have to, use the triggers to flip between categories. 
---
You also get perk card packs, for the 1st 10 levels it's every 2 levels, afterwards every 5. 
---
Use that build site to familiarize yourself with cards, make note of what level the cards you want unlock.
---
Even then, I don't get those production values. Same with food or anything with a given production value, it's never the given value. It's always way off.
---
I'm asking if you will have to play the BR mode to unlock the perks for use in Adventure/Survival or if you can just pick them on level up in Adventure/Survival.
---
 Sure, but if it adds retains players it keeps the DLC coming for all modes.
---
Thats most likely where you find weapons/armor instead of it being dropped on the floor. Kinda like cheats in fortnite
---
Please don‚Äôt give them ideas
---
fo76 stuff caught me off guard, it all looks good, still upset at no mod support or single player mode
---
So basically perks that replace armor perks and mutations.
---
Yes I actually start awake at night extremely concerned about the down votes I received on this comment.
---
Then I think it comes down to difference in opinion
---
I've been a long term fan of the FO series, and I also happen to enjoy BR (well, one of the BR games out there that's also free to play)
---
I might be speaking out of terms here, but I don't see how introducing a BR mode would require that much more development: just the same PvP, same looting system, add in a ring of fire that deals damage to players, add in some HUD elements (player count) annnnnndddddd that's kinda it now you have a BR mode.
---
Which is why it doesn't bother me at all. If they could  introduce a popular game mode (I get it, it seems like an EA move) for free, with minimal development required - why not?
---
No
---
You can bring your base apparently? How does that work
---
For once we'll be the OG survivors :o
---
(well, the people before us... they don't count)
---
NPC'S!!!
---
the skill checks made me so happy now maybe charisma can be used for more than just the four points i need for lone wanderer.
---
Fully agree.
---
Absolutely, it‚Äôs in a great state right now. Get your character up and ready for the new content coming
---
Yea, because in the BR mode you go in with no mutations and or previous weapons/armor
---
Yes, more to nuclear winter than the be mode
---
That tripod sound is chilling.
---
This nibba likes naked dudes
---
Oh sorry.  I‚Äôm not sure it doesn‚Äôt specify but I‚Äôm going to assume you can‚Äôt pick them up in Adventure.  It‚Äôs an incredibly smart move on their part to get people to play the mode.
---
Maybe
---
Plasma caster in the image for wastelanders!
---
Maybe so
---
I think most of the people who were really mad at the game found something else to complain about üòõ
---
And yes, the servers are stable now üôÇ
---
Honestly I just hope they add ring of fire to the radio now with the update
---
Yeah everything we are getting looks pretty darn good to me. Now lets see implementation and hope its a smooth process.
---
There is no way in hell that fallout 76 can be the best battle royals ever, there are dedicated games to br, and this would require a complete fundamental change to achieve that.
---
Might have something to do with them launching the game in an absolutely trash state
---
Want all 3. Like yesterday.
---
I was referring to the fact they‚Äôre adding BR now dipshit.
---
And tbh, they made their version of BR look pretty badass
---
It's obviously not going to be dude
---
Yeah it's near there. South of the behemoth. Maybe easier to go to the vantage and head south. I just fast travelled to the bed and breakfast... Went into parking lot, yellow BB building on my right.run past it and look for some white stairs. Go up the first set (is actually four sets with landings in between). There are more steps that lead further up, but that's not the spot! Hug the cliff wall to the right and follow it, other stairs should be above you and also to the right when you begin. You'll be facing firmly east at this point. May take a minute or so of running. When you reach the firecracker berries look up. There will be a sharp, almost 90 degree cliff jutting out on the left side (btw it was a tent not a shack under this cliff) and another cliff on the right. Continue up the middle and it looks around to the top.

Dev Diary for Nuclear Winter :: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ir7cRRiVGjw
---
I don't know how I feel about content for Adventure mode being locked behind a BR mode that I have zero interest in. You'll be missing skins, perks, maybe more? I dunno about that as a thing - seems a bit not good.
---
Nothing about post play when you become the overseer in the article
---
Optional is fine, but if they start putting story stuff behind it, that's where I tap out. And personally, I don't do competitive multiplayer anymore. I had too many years of playing CS 1.6 and CSS semi-competitively, and just too much COD4 when it came out. I know what it does to me, and I don't like that.
---
From the linked article: 
---
&gt; Higher tier enemies like the Scorchbeasts drop the best gear in the game.
---
Well not the best but a example of how to do a BR mode right.
---
Nothing about Nuclear Winter apart from BR- I‚Äôd be surprised if that was all that was included. I‚Äôm happy to not have everything spoiled, although I‚Äôm basically just holding out till NPCs at this point. :)
---
Ask them to substantiate what they're saying. 
---
 "It just sucks lol" isn't a valid reason. If they can't offer anything besides recycled hate they read in the first weeks of the games launch, then they're probably not worth debating with.
---
I apologize that your request cannot be fulfilled before we must use our resources to provide for Battle Royale screw you
---
because there isn't any, you just gain Overseer ranks for doing beating it over and over
---
Looking forward to completely ignoring this like survival mode.
---
I'd take Ring of Fire added to the radio though.
---
That Certainly wasn't johnny Cash on the stream.
---
Yeah especially when they are selling ammo for 5 caps each
---
Oh yeah and it looked like that was in a new area too. Hopefully the bow is stronger than the crossbow
---
I can't help but feel that will happen once it leaves beta.
---
Idk I think it‚Äôll be fun :-/ everyone‚Äôs welcome to their opinion though
---
I actually went inside a nuke zone for the first time. Watching it go off at Whitesprings, right next to my CAMP, was amazeballs.
---
I get the feeling that the 52 player count will dwindle pretty quick after the match starts.
---
I think I speak for a number of people who bought 76 because it wasn‚Äôt a BR like everything else coming out at the time. That said I‚Äôll still try it out and maybe I will end up getting in to it.
---
Agreed. At first I hated the idea, but now that some information is coming out, I'm actually excited to try it.
---
Where‚Äôs Bobby B when we need him?!
---
I‚Äôm totally gonna annoy everyone around me by talking back to the NPCs through my mic.
---
^^^well, ^^^^maybe...
---
I guess I didn‚Äôt check the date on the video so you may be right. Was just scrolling through vids. Actually makes sense since i thought why mine doesn‚Äôt do that much damage now that you say that.
---
Ugh,  fucking battle royal bullshit.
---
That's super cool
---
How much?
---
Yes, there alway people on server if that what you mean. Game far from dead
---
Offering people gameplay advantages across all gamemodes in the form of super strong perks only obtainable by playing a mode they might not even enjoy is NOT a "smart move", in my opinion.
---
Dude I remember you, you came at sat down at my bar üòÜ
---
No and it never will.
---
Yeah you could see a female companion running along with the player in that video, shooting enemies and such
---
I still have the 0/5 motors crafted bug from launch, but that's beside the point.
---
Because it should‚Äôve been in the game to begin with
---
Time to mass produce vintage nukashine and store them at overseer's camp.
---
Excited for Wastelanders...no so much about Nuclear Winter...like PVP, that game mode can go jump off a cliff.
---
- Main story continuation: Being how I haven't launched a nuke yet/gone into the Enclave bunker...I don't really know what to think on this...guess it's good?
---
- Bows: That was interesting to see. I'm actually excited for this, I always thought it odd we didn't have bows and arrows given how much easier it would be to craft them vs actual guns and ammo.
---
- Panning for gold: Why? Gold is pretty common in game and selling scrap gold to vendors doesn't net you much caps.
---
- NPCs: About damn time. Happy to see these.
---
- Dialog trees: Happy to see this too! And mostly happy about no crappy FO4 dialog wheel. Man that thing sucked.
---
- Space station: Awesome! I'm glad to see they're actually doing something with this place.
---
- Monster: Another big monster to hunt most likely...for high levels...eh.
---
- New gear: Meh.
---
- Choices &amp; consequences: I'm interested to see how that plays out...so my thoughts are...if you help the NPCs...you'll see the world change for the better? Maybe less monsters...more NPCs come in...they start rebuilding. If you don't help them...less NPCs and more monsters/chaos. However...how would they do that for everyone to see?
---
It's not available yet, so hold onto your old world money until it's officially announced.
---
I haven't seen everything, but from what I understand the Nuclear Winter starts tomorrow, along with  making the game free to play for a week. And Wastelanders comes some time in the future?
---
Is there anything being added to the game tomorrow for people who don't want to play NW? Other than a ton of people who didn't have to pay to play the game like I did? I'm feeling a bit testy, I have to admit.
---
Youtube videos about the e3 revel on gamespot are already full of salt.  People don't care they just want to hate this game for all eternity.
---
Yeah BR is cringe but overall the game is pretty good
---
They're adding PvE vault raids to so theres something for everyone
---
Not sure if I can trust Jeff Kaplan's evil twin brother
---
Actually, that would be a great mechanic but I don't think that's the problem here because I managed to get loot on a sbq just now, with a much lower damage weapon.
---
I think I'll play something else until Wastelanders.  
---
I'm just not a BR kind of player.  PvP just bores me.  No story.  No real goal beyond kill, repeat.
---
It was the same group who sang the FO76 cover of Country Roads!
---
To everyone saying saying 76 doesn‚Äôt need NPCs. Shut up this is amazing.
---
Im hyped for wastelanders. I want to see if they change how factions work, so you cant be in every faction in the game. 
---
Nuclear Winter looks pretty good, not big on battle royales but who knows. I might give it a go.
---
Looks pretty interesting to say the least, having to fight off both people and creatures while worrying about nuke drops at the same time. The ring of literal fire also looks pretty neat compared to other BR games where its something like gas or just an orange screen saying get out. Probably won't try this immediately however since there's always the issue of what bugs or technical issues such a thing could produce initially, but i'm hoping it goes well.
---
I'm hoping they can come up with a good way to explain it being here. I'd be content with it being a prototype I suppose...
---
Are there really adding NPCs?
---
Well what got you interested in it again?
---
Wastelanders is in the fall. 
---
Nuclear winter is coming shortly. 
---
Those 2 updates couldn't be more different.
---
 If you're into pvp go ahead and jump in. If you want a nore story driven pve experience maybe hold off.
---
Rude! That was Fleshman Longlegs, and he is a (somewhat) human-esque being just like you!
---
Don't shoot the possums. Poor little guys are just trying to get by.
---
I liked that it seemed to interact with more than itself. Like the fact that there seems to be a point in taking first (trying to become overseer.)
---
I'm guessing all the broken PvP elements will be gone. Probably don't get to enter with your inventory of legendaries and have to rely on drops within the world.
---
I hope there‚Äôs also a lot of customization for it
---
Are you actually expecting fallout 5 to be ruined because of updates to 76? That's like not wanting to play Elder Scrolls 6 because Elder Scrolls Online released a boss you didn't like.
---
Check r/Fallout.
---
At this point, I'm convinced the majority of these people were never going to give it a chance in the first place, even before the mainstream hate bandwagon began. They've made up their minds, and it's a shame because this game is great... and it's only going to get better.
---
I think there's something diferent in the crossbow you can see in the trailer, like a diferent version of the weapon or regular crossbow with mods maybe?
---
I'm surprisingly excited.
---
What in the fuck are you on about? The building mode was and is used by plenty of people who play fallout 4. That‚Äôs the stupidest thing I‚Äôve ever heard. 
---
Splitting this player base up even more and trying to attract an audience with a gimmick game mode is stupid as fuck, this game needs real story content and not gimmicks.
---
Also a set of flame red hellfire armor appeared in a scene.
---
Yeah man, already got a crew ready to try it out!
---
I'm hoping otherwise this will never be a game mode a lot of people will play
---
All of your negative points are because you have avoided those facets of the game.
---
i got it from greenmangaming since beta
---
It prevents nothing.. All players will spawn exactly where you first set down camp. Trap bases are already possible &amp; yet we hardly hear about them at best mats would have a minor impact on traps, yet a massive improvement on not spawning inside of floors.
---
Yes, the two factions will be the generic survival good guys, and the raiders, you have to pick a side it seems.
---
But other than skins there‚Äôs not a huge incentive. If you don‚Äôt like the mode you don‚Äôt like the mode, there‚Äôs going to be vault raids coming in the weeks after the BR mode so there‚Äôs that
---
Hmm that‚Äôs a good question.  I have no idea.
---
I‚Äôd believe that it took developer time but really I imagine 60% of nuclear winter was probably ready before the game was shipped. Even if it did take developer time, since 76 was a pretty big part of Beth‚Äôs E3. I can say with confidence that they don‚Äôt have a skeleton crew of devs just trying to right the ship. 
---
They keep showing it off and talking about how they fucked up. They want this to be the cash cow they hoped it would be and are working toward that. It‚Äôs not anthem which packed up it‚Äôs best devs to work on another game after a month.
---
I considered it then on my next try, used a lower damage weapon and did get loot. I'll check the weapon I was previously using again to see if the problem is the weapon itself or otherwise located.
---
Scrip
---
Because gameplay &gt; lore
---
Not saying I agree, just pointing out what happens, it‚Äôs the same for movies.
---
*Loads his lever action rifle* Bring it on...
---
Is this game ever gonna come to steam? Saw some articles a while ago, say it was, but still no info.  Disappointing nothing was said during the show.
---
The only horrible part is all the clickbait articles and videos saying ‚Äúbethesda finally goes free to play‚Äù even though its one week
---
76 content aside that was the worst E3 presentation I've ever seen. Boredom start to finish.
---
&gt; If you wait long enough it will come to steam. 
---
I really hope Bethesda allows some sort of account linking with Steam. I'd hate to have to do everything all over again on Steam.
---
Some chatacters have weapons on their back, does this mean we could do the same like in FO3 and New Vegas?
---
you guys are cucks this is top tier shillary
---
Oh wow, this makes me grateful for my crappy 5 Mbps internet! The first patch took three days for me to download but at least I could leave my PS4 to do it while I did other things. I almost cried a few months ago when something got corrupted and everything g had to be downloaded again. You have my sympathies.
---
I used to back when it released.
---
damn it‚Äôs not bethesda‚Äôs fault, just bad luck dude
---
You've been very helpful.
---
Anyone else notice under wastelanders the new features looks something pretty close to a Security Bot or bot of the sort and the vault boy having some sort of beacon in his hand???
---
That is my concern. Vested time into the pvp aspect which seems to be a low blow to the current players. We took our own poll and 6% wanted pvp. Hell even todd said we decided to be nice. I get that they want some fortnite cash.  But if they keep tossing all their chips that way it just slows down pve progress for the user base that never left.  Let's say they do come, that also brings the toxicity with it.  The trolling and workshop hell has been culled quit a bit id hate for it to flair back up.
---
Probably. That would be about 9 am EST I believe.
---
armor penetration perks are quite useful for those glowing bois. also some crippling is also nice, they are almost cute as they lay on the ground unable to move
---
You'd think this community above all others would have learned to not judge something before its released, but apparently some still haven't learned.
---
What would you suggest?
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say taken out, but they wouldn‚Äôt be the end game anymore. It‚Äôs be the faction fight between raiders and settlers.
---
whats the difference?
---
One example. I doubt it‚Äôs all the same.
---
At least it'll get rid of the squekers that like to grief. Feel like the whole mode will just be traps.
---
You get outta here with such blasphemy !
---
They are the boot leg version of raccoons so they need to be protected
---
Way too little, way too late. Waste of dev time on a already dead game.
---
Raiders would be nice, or gunners, I hope they add settlers too that defend your camp like in FO4
---
I love that we‚Äôre finally getting NPCs, but overall I think that Bethesda almost certainly didn‚Äôt need a press conference at all this year.
---
Well that didn‚Äôt take long. From ‚Äòwe want NPCs‚Äô to  ‚Äòthese dialogue trees better not suck‚Äô in 90 minutes.
---
As long as there's no broken elements like the game has now yea.
---
I mean I get it they might want to sell something
---
Ok. That video....changes my mind. I was anti-BR but that looks legit!!!!
---
Give back buzzblade damage!!
---
Negative points are about the new game mode...that's about it. Nothing else was negative...only...apathetic.
---
Yep. This might tempt me to finally buy some atoms, though.
---
Trust me everyone in the fallout 76 community are the nicest people ever.We always help others out around here üëç
---
What are depreciating resources, what is finite resources, what is money and time management 
---
See I can be a snark too
---
Awesome! Logical direction to take the game in, so it seems like good times ahead!
---
Then I gotta stick with what I've seen. They could've been bugged or not, just doesn't change my opinion that people can deal way more damage with bloodied and sponge more damage with Cav/Sen.
---
That hasn't stopped people from complaining about it before they even know if it's bad.
---
Lmfao, the Bethesda player base is so toxic.
---
Not playing this dogshit scam of a game. How many times will you rebuild your DLC house in Sims:Fallout before getting bored?
---
Speaking as someone who was one of the first to beat the final boss
---
Its still gonna be the same online game, basically like ESO
---
Checked in the ESM. They'll all work for the moment. Most of these perks wouldn't work for weapons that are both a rifle and a shotgun, or a rifle and a heavy gun, but nothing tests for rifle + pistol. Probably because it's not supposed to happen.
---
They likely have different teams working on different aspects of the games. That how you can get different types of content worked on at the same time. Your just salty that pvp players are getting acknowledged at all. Wastelanders will not have been made better by dedicating resources from NW and vice versa.
---
Possibly!
---
It should still be online.
---
geez, we got NPCs. Who cares about the rest. Join us in the annex for refreshments and celebration!
---
I‚Äôm actually happy, I‚Äôll definitely come back to the Wasteland for this update. Closer to what I expected.
---
&gt;I was one of those Fallout 4 style role-players
---
Oh, you poor sole. I'm being completely genuine in saying that I'm happy what they are releasing elates you, but please don't refer to fallout 4 as an rpg
---
Be patient bro, this is a placeholder for the next installments so I'm pretty sure they're gonna keep releasing stuff over the years. &lt;3
---
This will be my first atom purchase. It's not that I refused to buy them, but I got everything I wanted with those I earned by playing.
---
I hope they add VR support someday.
---
I said I liked it and and now people absolutely hate me on YT. It looks good to me though
---
Could you maybe be happy for those of us that love pvp
---
Yeah I use my bloody DCG most of the time. I didn‚Äôt even need the latest survival one but wish it woulda been available for me early on. What a great freebee
---
It gets downvoted by the corporate shills this sub is dominated by.
---
It's coming to steam by the end of the year
---
Honestly yeah, I hope they make factions more than just "I'm a prerecorded message, welcome aboard to all of the factions" and actually have more player engagement and actually having it feel like you're in a faction instead of just there.
---
Oh agreed!
---
I mean they wouldn't be wrong...
---
It‚Äôs not legitimate criticism because there isn‚Äôt anything to criticize. It‚Äôs a thinly veiled complaint.
---
I was being sarcastic/a dick.  As in like, the people who are so vehemently against it are acting as if that were the case.
---
Ya know, the more I see and hear about it the more fun it appears it will be. Color me curious.
---
That's a good anti-assaultron weapon
---
Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if you had to reach a certain level to join a time jumped world. It would make much more sense is you had people used to the world and well off instead of newcomers roaming years after the vault opens canonically.
---
It would still be online, perhaps instanced.
---
They‚Äôre also having a free week starting June 10th
---
The new perks do not carry over to the other modes so no one is being forced to do anything :)
---
The vaults and more content are still coming, the BR is basically 1/3 of it. Itll be revealed more once we get the roadmap, just like how wild appalachia only showed survival mode and ‚Äúnew quests‚Äù
---
I'll have to rewatch, if they are adding mods to it that'll be wicked. Definitely something people have been asking for for a while.
---
I think he doesn't want to have to deal with another launcher on his pc and I don't blame him
---
But can we all agree they took the whole ring of fire thing from bfv lol üòÇ like straight outta firestorm bro
---
is this a real thing that happens? that's really cool actually
---
What's the "forcing" part? Forcing would be making you play PvP to get the cards.
---
What an ungrateful fucking twat
---
I didn't give a damn about Survival mode, only used it for the special weapons, but NW looks nice, at least before launch.
---
Even though I hate PVP in RPGs, I may play this new mode quite frequently.....
---
at least until Wastelanders arrive :P
---
Them adding NPCs after talking about how it's a lIvInG wOrLd where the people will fill those roles can now be looked at as another lie told simply because the game was rushed and they didn't have the time to put in the npcs like they wanted to.
---
And I don't think people really need anymore excuses to hate F76. Even EA, who are complete scumfucks, don't outright scam people like Bethesda did with everything surrounding the product. 
---
It's not like I hate it, either, I'm probably going to pick it back up again. But I'm not at the stage where the massive Bethesda dick inside my ass has taken control and I've lost all capacity for critical thought.
---
Bingo
---
You really can't grasp the concept that introducing a BR mode might entice gamers who haven't played the Fallout series before? In your own words, BR games are very popular. This is one way to tap that market.
---
lol y'all piss and moan about pvp and people being mean in a nuclear wasteland but are excited about a battle royal
---
Looking forward to getting a few people coming back and realising it's nothing like what they remember/were told
---
I'm also wondering: what would be the motivation of an individual to become an overseer for a vault when they just got out of one?
---
HA HAA! Come fall and I can finally kill all you raiders
---
Of all of 76's flaws, this isn't one that I'm worried about. If you worked in a company like Bethesda that had so many assets just lying around, wouldn't you use them? If it works then why the hell not.
---
Getting ready to be called a "Bethesda paid employee" by reddit
---
If you thought the launch state of Fallout 76 was acceptable, then that's on you. There's unfinished and then there's 'here's an alpha for $60.'
---
Battle Royale in a Fallout game is like putting high heels on an elephant. Its a ridiculous idea. 
---
Its basically taking a popular gamemode and shoehorning into a game that does not need it just for the sake of jumping on the BR bandwagon.
---
Well.  Now we know. \*sigh\*
---
day one ride or die player here. I'm just hoping for operator swag suits and raider faction glory. All the PvP in Pve punks with bloody builds better grab their akaks. Time to put up or shut up. Tune into Rose and do the dang. Give me raider quests!!
---
I wonder if it's the same asset as the Creation Club content, as if do that opens up the possibility of other stuff from there being ported over like the OG 10mm.
---
They give you a CD case with a digital code inside it stupid
---
Pretty sure you already proved you could be a snark with your first comment there, bud. Tone back the edgy high schooler a tad. Don't like the game? Don't play it. No need to shit on things you don't enjoy the idea of and ruin it for everyone else.
---
Last night I fought a glowing gulper that had all the sound effects and the cool down period of a sentry bot. Had steam coming out of his back and everything.
---
You have PVP mode...how about a game mode that isn't PVP driven for people who HATE PVP? Ya know...keep it balanced and all.
---
It's not a single player game and never will be.
---
We don't go on killing sprees because we cant lol
---
Not really, the people who are dead in the quests are certain factions/people, completely separate from the NPCs who are coming from another region
---
I have been under the opinion there couldn‚Äôt be anything worse then battle royal in 76 but that clip has definitely got me keen if they‚Äôve done it right I think it could be a lot of fun.
---
&gt; With online only games, battle royales, mobile games, etc, it just seems like they‚Äôve decided to move in a different direction. 
---
I hope that you do realize that these are *in addition* to the core games. Elder Scrolls 6 is going to be exactly what you'd expect of it. A pure fantasy RPG. Fallout 5 will come whenever it will come and it will be the successor for Fallout 4.
---
Releasing mobile games, online games, battle royale modes and whatnot does NOTHING to their main line of games. They don't slow down development as they have completely separate teams working on them and if Fo76 wasn't developed at all, then they'd just have a different side project going on or they'd have less employees.
---
Bow and arrow confirmed?
---
  
---
PLEASE!
---
I know right? Probably the best one so far.
---
Oh that is a big dead game
---
My big thing is, you get to take the caps and XP back to normal mode, can set up defensive camp turrets ahead of time minus the turrets, can earn perks that some may or may not transfer back over... and lose nothing. Also, unlocking stuff through the mode like camp goodies and cosmetics. I see no reason not to play. I'll \**never*\* win, I'm not good at PvP and never will be, but I can at least join in, have some fun, earn some goods, and possibly infuriate the \**FUUUUUUUCK*\* out of someone trying to get me (I can't hit for jack, but I am fairly good at evasion).
---
Was hoping that meant midnight lol
---
Not a battle royale guy, but it seems like an interesting twist. Will definitely give it a try
---
It could just be the specific branch they chose to demonstrate that makes it look this way. There are some parts of Fallout 3 and New Vegas that you could probably do this same thing. However, I do see your point. If this remains indicative of the rest of the dialogue, then it wouldn‚Äôt really be that much different from the 4-choice ‚ÄúYes‚Äù options from Fallout 4, these are just listed out. Time will tell, but honestly even with a basic Fallout 4 system the game will be improved dramatically.
---
" Nuclear Winter has a grand total of 73 Perk cards for you to unlock and equip; ten of these cards are for this mode only and cannot be carried over to Adventure or Survival Mode. These include Walking Arsenal (combines all the weight reduction benefits for ranged weapons into one card); Frog Legs (increases jump height); and Briefcase Bloodhound (helps you track down nuke briefcases). Each of these Nuclear Winter-exclusive cards is built to better suit the faster pace of this new mode. "
---
It looks like the cards won't mess with PvE too much. And if they would have made them more powerful, they're exclusive to NW.
---
The PC version comes with a digital download code. No disc included, it says on the amazon page
---
Well there's the culture at the PVP Battle Royale asshats but I think many people's concerns including mine or limited resources being diverted to PVP content instead of PVE content that we want
---
It looked amazing! I can‚Äôt wait to get in there and see everything
---
My badüòÇ
---
gonna take apart a trailer... come on man.. Just cool it you sound like a millennial. you got NPCs , if this ain't your gig go to wow
---
I'm up for trying it. I don't really see it working in the Fallout engine, but no harm in giving it a shot.
---
Bethesda website said it went live July 8th.
---
Get in here!!
---
Same here
---
All we need now is dog companions!
---
Start out in Adventure mode - don't get intimidated by the higher level players (in Adventure mode) - they are high level because they love the game.
---
 [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/4f9q90xXpnRJ8vlIWVJxVK/fallout-76-nuclear-winter-is-coming](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/4f9q90xXpnRJ8vlIWVJxVK/fallout-76-nuclear-winter-is-coming) 
---
Perks are exclusive to battle royale. There are skins and camp plans though to be unlocked.
---
Thanks jaj, that's actually very good intel you've provided.
---
As I've told other people, it doesn't seem like the problem was low damage (I actually tried a lower damage shotgun afterwards and got loot) so the search continues.
---
Awww yisssss time to profit!!
---
They did a great job tricking us for a year, but everything good is worth the wait. NPCs, NPCs...... NPCs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
It looked like it‚Äôs gonna be a freakin blast
---
Sadly you are correct, people are overly negative towards this game and its disheartening.
---
Theres a lot of notes and stuff indicating people have also moved on to escape the scorched plague as well. It would also make sense that people from other areas like  DC may wander our way to escape the destruction there.
---
"If you don't like the same things I do then something's wrong with you."
---
I‚Äôm not sure why they would. Adventure mode was ‚Äúclassic‚Äù mode when the survival mode went live and that only brought good changes like no more camp destruction. If you‚Äôre talking more limits to PvP in adventure mode I pretty sure the majority of the community would be ok with that.
---
Mostly the drop camp plans so I just farmed them all the time until I had just about everything unlocked.
---
Nice
---
EXTRA HYPE
---
It's interesting. I'm not a big BR person but I'm very curious to see the rewards/penalties in this mode.
---
Also, call be bias but I run a shop that almost exclusively sells ammo so daddy can't wait to stack those sweet sweet caps.
---
Bugs are harder and ingrained deeper, than exploits.
---
New meat
---
From the way they announced the game I assumed it was more about creating a multiplayer fallout world that they could expand on as people played/become invested in it. The main problem is their piss poor communication about what they're doing with it or what their plan is (I'm assuming because they're too busy actually working on the bloody game) has led to all these mad theories about Bethesda secretly using 76 to insult fallout fans or shit like that.
---
unfortunately i'm on pc, but thank you for the offer
---
Sell it. I don't even collect .38 rounds anymore, but from time to time I end up with it. I place it in my vending machines at 0 caps and someone usually collects it.
---
It's fairly easy to sell the popular types of ammo: .45, 5.56, 2mm EC, and especially shotgun shells. I can't keep shotgun shells in stock for good reason--they take quite a lot of resources to craft.  At one cap each, they fly off my shelves. Plastic, while readily available for casual use, is hard to come by when you need large quantities.
---
Bulking and scrapping, imo, isn't really necessary. While some would disagree, it's really, really easy to get lead, steel, and gunpowder if you know where to look. Crafting/smelting is also a good source of XP when you're doing it in huge quantities. You should check out how much exp you get after smelting ore and crafting 20,000 rounds of 5mm after sleeping and consuming cranberry relish.

Reminds me of the centaurs of older games
---
rivet*
---
Fallout 5 will be single player how will NW ruin it?
---
Smart choice.
---
Yeah I think at this point the br fad is dying. I think it would have been cooler if nuclear winter was about actual winter coming to Appalachia, like the lore said there was massive storm some years after the bombs. But whatever. Hope people enjoy it but I never had the intention of trying it
---
The hive mind will come up with something.
---
My expectations were high because I assumed they were going to try to "fix" their current reputation due to 76. I was expecting something big not just expansions of current games and two new games that... just don't exactly look exciting.
---
Fortnite 76
---
yeah that's why i am disappointed, full circle bud
---
It is for the new BR mode. They need to put it in survival too imo.
---
&gt;ten of these cards are for this mode only and cannot be carried over to Adventure or Survival Mode.
---
oh ok, my problem was that i read it as "only this 10 cards wont be able to be carried over" but its more like "perk cards wont be able to be carried over", silly me.
---
It‚Äôs smart in the sense that people will curiously do it to see what they get.  The whole game is a black hole.  Every time you think you‚Äôre bored you find 84 more things to chase after.  The curiosity alone will bring people in, and hopefully they‚Äôll quickly realize Fallout is not supposed to be a BR series.  Chances are those perks will eventually become attainable in Adventure soon enough.  It‚Äôs a business at the end of the day.  They‚Äôre trying things to get people to try those things.
---
Oh, it's ok, I'll go look it up, shame on me for being lazy in the first place. ; )
---
There are only public servers right now. And there is a survival server, but you might want to get your feet wet in adventure mode first.
---
Have fun out there. And good luck.
---
Do you live in a country where 50 dollars is a month's salary or something?

https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/2wU959pkgw2VOsCMPZSpCg/celebrate-be3-2019-with-the-e3-atom-bonus-bundle
---
The Bethesda E3 2019 Showcase has wrapped, but we‚Äôre still celebrating! From now through July 8, you can pick up a one-time limited bundle when you purchase Atoms directly from the Atom Shop in-game. During this window, when you buy 1000 Atoms for $9.99, you‚Äôll get a bonus 500 Atoms,¬†plus¬†six repair kits and Elder‚Äôs Battlecoat to take with you into Wild Appalachia.¬†
---
That's true. I just wish they would fix it. It's no fun when there's no reaction time at all. I can one shot people and I can be one shot. Neither scenario is fun.
---
Rookie question, but how do we nukezone?
---
Tbh I'm yet to see them getting flak that they didn't 100% deserve.
---
Honestly just say it is canon, if people were just fine with that it opens the day for plenty of other interesting ideas imo
---
You‚Äôre getting downvoted for being a dick to the other guy, not for your opinion, FYI.
---
&gt;Cash grab
---
Its free.
---
Ah, you're right, they do show it in the trailer. I didn't notice it the during the show.
---
stop trying so hard. imagine someone actually saying those words out loud, try not to cringe.
---
Very possible my friend
---
From the sarcastic funny guys on Twitter it‚Äôs shit like ‚ÄúImagine NPCs being an innovative feature for an RPG‚Äù
---
When does the Battle Royale come out?
---
Oh yeah, I see it on their site. That's huge! Sadly, they say "Unlike Survival Mode". Can't imagine how leaving this in survival would make any sense.
---
Personally I'm a pvp but that one comment was pretty mean
---
This is... so sad but also, I'm glad he served you well. Hmm, now I'm craving crispy awesome possum bacon.
---
All I can say is that I'm a little disappointed that it wasn't inside a vault. A tight enclosed corridor battle royale as things explode, destroying sections of the vault and flames rapidly engulfing inside sounded really interesting.
---
Fortnite streamers see dollar signs because of the free weekend, and their cults of 7 year olds flock to their blue haired gods. Fortnite kiddies flood 76 and eventually find out about "adventure mode." They invade our generally pleasant community, grief, troll, pic rape, et cetera. People stop being nice, community dies, game dies. All before wastelanders has a chance.
---
Nah servers don‚Äôt really work like that. You get put where there is an opening more or less. Only way to choose is if you are friends with someone and you join their world. There‚Äôs adventure mode and survival mode. Now there is a soon to be BR mode too. You pick when you first log in with your character.
---
I just had that. 
---
I'm in a large chat group on ps4 and went in there to tell a friend that was interested in 76 about the free week. 
---
First reply was from someone else. "I heard that game is going free to play"
---
I suspect they didn't want to over promise and under deliver, but swung to far the other way. But that's me.
---
&gt; it'll be riddled with bugs and probably unbalanced
---
The space station was the place I was most excited about before launch, I even avoided going therevon my own at first because I was sure it would be a big part of the main questlines. Needless to say I as real disappointed by the time I finally got there. Excited to see what they've done with the place, seems like an NPC settlement.
---
Down voting and posting the same link does not change the fact that it says June 10th 2019 under the Facebook and Twitter info. That is the date it is set to be posted, and the reason that it says do not publish in the title. It has not yet been officially posted
---
That's very sad :'c
---
And Old Man Mose is dead!!!
---
No one has bought any of my ammo that was set at 1 cap this past month.
---
I think I remember that too! I bought an imitation seafood and some water from you, I think.
---
Tonight or tomorrow.
---
Maybe you are privileged enough to not be in the same position as I am, but my salary's beside the point. I can like and not like things despite, as OP suggests, "issues".
---
Nice!  This looks like some PvP that I can finally get behind.
---
I don't like PvP in the main game because I'm usually doing other things and don't want to watch my back the entire time.  With Nuclear Winter, there's no quests to distract, it's pure.  Plus with XP and caps carrying over with no chance to drop your current inventory, there's no stress.
---
Some people might like the risky aspect of PvP, but not me.  Death is enough risk, I don't want to lose my shit too.  Can't wait to try this out!
---
*sobbing*. Pass the butter.
---
I remember being too afraid to leave Megaton for the first few days of playing so I made sure to get my karma really low and save up enough caps to get Jericho as a follower. Once we finally left Megaton, he got killed almost immediately by the super mutants on the way to GNR.
---
I had about 1000 atoms and said fuck it and bought a $10 card üòÇüòÇ
---
Ive got a plague doctors mask and preist vestiments because
---
I am the cure
---
A few weeks ago someone complained about how the frames were locked to 60. I had to explain that hasn't been the case since a few weeks after launch when they fixed the physics bugs by linking them to the server rather than the players pc. 
---
People don't realise that many issues they read about have been fixed already or are non issues to many players (No NPCs)
---
The only real gripe I have with this is
---
they still need more balancing with the weapons/legendary effects/ perks etc 
---
As a separate mode I totally dig it. I just don‚Äôt want to see one particular item ruining it for everyone.
---
Then, because they‚Äôre kids they get bored and quit playing. It‚Äôs a wave. Gotta ride it dude.
---
Props, it's good to know a overt but relatively fair critic got some access and to air their opinions aloud. By any chance, and assuming you can discuss it, did they mention future bug fixes on things you had mentioned?
---
it'll just work!
---
Trying hard? Speak for yourself lmao.
---
Ugh, they fixed this about 6 weeks ago where you would no longer take fall damage when standing up from trick chairs or being thrown by spike traps at players' camps. Did they really break it and bring that back?
---
I actually clapped too!  I'm so excited!
---
I'm not "hating on the game." I'm mocking *you* for stating that not liking a video game mechanic means that there's something wrong with you as a person. Neither of us mentioned the game itself; no idea how you jumped to that.
---
I walked into a Gamestop the other day (my first mistake, I know). He asked me what I was playing and I said FO76. The look on his face and his scoff were just so off-putting. Like dude, let people enjoy things. It‚Äôs not without its criticisms but not like any game is perfect. Just let people enjoy what they enjoy.
---
I am seriously considering setting up a friendly goodie booth outside the vault. Only problem is, I need more screws and metal and whatnit to do it proper, and not enough time to farm it.
---
Game's dead and damage is done by that point, and you would be surprised how much asshole middleschoolers enjoy being assholes.
---
Rookie question but I keep seeing people nukezone areas and have yet to figure out how to do so. Do you have any tips?
---
Those legs go aaallllll the way up!
---
Godspeed.
---
Wasn‚Äôt a dick at all. He answered for you and made an assumption. Also dgaf
---
‚ÄúAll criticism for this game I like is invalid‚Äù
---
Bow?
---
Bow!
---
BOWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!
---
**faint**
---
watching a stream of the reveal and the streamer kept trashing it I thought it was funny cause if you go to their youtube they have a playlist of 200 episodes of 76 when it first launched, and when they finished the main story they never went back or if they did they never streamed it they only complain idk sometimes....how about going back and checking out the updates to the game before you complain if you haven't played since launch imo. I think the wild appalachia update has made the game better in some ways and I am enjoying the game and I don't care what so and so streamer says.
---
That's what I'm thinking, yeah. I'm interested to hear them talk about new Vaults. Always love me some Vault lore.
---
Adios amigo
---
Might have something to do with the space station maybe? It featured heavily in the trailer and they sent chimps into space didn't they maybe they/it was in there all along and managed to bust out.
---
:-)
---
They'll probably have reskinned Appalachias as different game modes
---
Commenting for later use! I‚Äôm getting that mfing coat
---
I love it.  We need more disturbing FEV nightmares in this franchise.
---
Just launching a nuke, I was referring to the big red circle on the map you get after the detonation.
---
I don't think it will, I mean it's just holotapes and notes. Don't see why they can't keep the original quest line available even for new players years from now.
---
To be fair, this is Reddit, not the actual community, just a feisty sub-portion. And the downvotes were because of how often that question comes up (not that I participated in the downvoting, but that's largely the reason).
---
I was feeling this when the game launched with all the firestorm. People dropping out for lack of anything to do. Bethesda will have to course correct by adding back npc‚Äùs was my hope. Even full on MMO‚Äùs have npc‚Äùs to give quests after all. To totally remove them was an iffy decision. Glad they‚Äôre here.
---
It's the 9th here.
---
Current meta is based around Bloodied weps id say. So Bloodied Explosive Rifleman Sneak builds, Bloodied Melee build and then a lot of people are using unyielding armour with sentinel perks along with the Bloodied weps
---
When you put thousands of rounds in one...  
---
Had one of those rare days when everyone showed up for SBQ and she goes full sponge.  
---
It got really odd that all of us 100+ stayed knowing better.  
---
15 people standing there when she fell.  
---
I gotta admit it was fun.
---
I can see your point as I'm not much of BR person myself and likely won't spend too much time there however; there could be some benefits to general community. 
---
More opportunities to get these turkey griefers out of the "civilized" world. Secondly, increased traffic to the player owned shops in other modes for things like ammo and other resources.
---
Yeah both we're me üòÑ I got some great pictures
---
Well then I guess you should throw out or delete the game. Idk what to tell you. I don‚Äôt see that happening. Also, I love them game and some douchy kids running around (that I can mute and block) is r going to stop me.
---
Didn't we kill the scorched queen at the conclusion of the main quest, wiping out the scorched plague?
---
Exactly
---
I have a base XBOX 1 and it‚Äôs been fine for me!  Few rough patches at the beginning but it wasn‚Äôt the console and more the servers.
---
It says as you rank up you get access to more parts of Vault 51, icons, schematics, skins and more
---
Well then youll  be relieved that Yong Yea was extremely positive about Wastelanders and praised multiple things about it. He didnt even have anything bad to say about Battle Royale and said it could be interesting. So calm yourself
---
I'm really excited to give this a try for a whole week, but I've got a couple of questions. How many gigabytes is the game? My internet sucks so I may have to literally install this for a full 24 hours. Also, when will it be made available for download? Have they said anything about that? Should I stay up until midnight to download it?
---
It became an essential item equipped with high performance of the backpack. But I don't like the look of the backpack. Please add Bethesda, Hide backpack as an option.
---
Hello, fellow PC'er, and welcome to Vault 76. My IGN is MrBright01. If you add me to your friends list and catch me online tomorrow, I'd be glad to get you some starting gear and/or answer questions (I have that kind of time, lately have just been running my in-game game and slacking anyhow).
---
Lmao fuck those joyless losers
---
Meme checks out. Good times ahead!
---
To be honest we have to wait and see what they actually deliver.  Their recent history doesn't give us much reason to trust their PR statements take, for just one example, the lack of updates on the promised mod support and dedicated servers.
---
Sweet I think I'll take a few of those perks then hopefully they won't patch it but even if they do it's still hitting pretty hard
---
Looks like you're on your way to Watoga to start some shit with the robots that call it home.
---
Youve seen what? One dialogue box and you already have to assume the rest will be the same? There is no pleasing some of you people.
---
Yes they do.  Only 10 of them will not.  There are 73.
---
Motown? What game was that in?
---
Mine works just fine. Sometimes my internet is laggy but it still works 99 pct of the time.
---
Hope it gives good loot like the Wendigo.
---
I mean I guess you guys can downvote but "Deal with it" is the exact answer you guys hate when it's applied to features you don't like. It's not constructive at all. I really respect that yes, it could be exploited but not to hurt anyone, and frankly not in too many ways because of the limited hostile areas you can actually place a camp.
---
 I love survival for the high tense air, and knowing I could die at any second but nobody really addressed why it would be a bad idea for your personal camp to be non Pvp other than "It's not for noobs" "just leave bro" and "ur supposed to die a lot".  It doesn't change anything about the playing at all if you don't stay in your camp anyways. 
---
People are already exploiting player vendor fast travel and spawn killing people, and hunting down high level marked players which is almost a unique issue to camps. They're doing it because you can maximize loot if you kill someone while they're unpacking rather than out on the road, it's the exact thing Bethesda has actually tried to help stop which is why you only get junk and some aid items anyways. 
---
I'll take the criticism but changing a single aspect to prevent spawn killing isn't against everything survival is about or destroying what the game is for, it's actually what Bethesda has been working to prevent on both survival and adventure.
---
Of course you can deal way more damage with bloodied weapons at low health!   That‚Äôs the whole idea behind it!  The thing is that you just don‚Äôt need to deal very much damage to kill another player so banning, removing, nerfing, or whatever your suggesting will have little effect on balance.  Besides, you can still dish out insane dps with a NON legendary weapon using adrenal reaction, nerd rage, alcohol and chems.   You can completely avoid a lot of damage with Serendipity, Dodgy, Lone Wanderer, Emergency Protocols, Psychotats and 1* Assassins armor.  No bloodied, Sentinel, or Cavalier needed to beat 95% of people out there.   You‚Äôll never win every fight you get into; bugs alone will ensure that.
---
Really is a sick paint job man, congrats
---
I was NOT pumped to see Battle Royal making its way into FO76, but after watching the dev video and reading your post I'm willing to try it. If for no other reason because I want those cool new things that carry over to adventure mode. There was some sweet looking PA paint they showed off that looked like it had nuclear fuel rids sticking out of it. Willing to bet its a rewards.  Who knows, I may even like it.
---
Fo5 is gonna be a long fking ass time. Maybe 10 years. Remember they have Starfield right now and ES6 isn't not even in sight.
---
I'm wondering this as well. I recently started playing again after a long break, but I'll just wait until Year 2 if it completely replaces the main questline.
---
My only hope is that nothing will be exclusive to the BR. I saw that hellfire armor and it looks awesome, I NEED it for my everyday playing needs. If there are special perks or whatever that only apply to BR that's fine, but I want all the gear from it in adventure mode too. Hell, it looks interesting enough that I might actually try it, but I'm not a big PvP player and don't expect to like it much
---
Yes but I figured there would just be another queen. Like the next female in line becomes the queen but that is where year two could take it.
---
52 players is still more than twice the amount of players in any given server.
---
Less dancing. More Caeser Flickerman.
---
Damn I shouldn‚Äôt have roasted those fags lol
---
Nah
---
Hell yes raider time
---
Nope, human npcs are coming in the Wastelanders update
---
You bet I will
---
Has no place in this kind of game imo. Would have much more preferred a PVE centric mode like a more intense survival mode where there is more rad damage and food and water do less.
---
No way!! Dude I thought it was so cool I actually got to sit down at a bar and order something from a player vendor! I‚Äôd love to see the pics and send me your GT so I can add you!
---
Low level Fixers and BoS Recon Rifles for our lowbie Horde coming. Time to start crafting.
---
Can't read can you? Human NPCs coming out of the Vault was deconfirmed, these new people are from out of state
---
Dumbass
---
i bet if you try it out for free from bethesda you will be forced to upgrade full price from them for $60 because that is still what a digital code costs from amazon directly and bethesda. they don't let you change emails so if anyone wants to try it for free for a week and not pay $60 full price to upgrade to a full copy; they are best to use a throw away email or something for the trial. unless they don't care about paying the full asking price after a week. this is just speculation on my part; i have no idea at all what price they will have it after the free week or at all in the future (off to look at more info on the free week).
---
I am sure it‚Äôs all coming. They are giving us stuff now they didn‚Äôt tease in the trailer. So all in due time.
---
If you look closely at the I Am Become Death quest, the part about nuking fissure prime and killing the Scorchbeast Queen has (optional) next to it. 
---
Now, I haven't actually completed this quest. So... could be nothing.
---
Definitely pretty amped to see that. Such a cool area that has so much unused potential.
---
Edgy is now talking about resources and time n money management...man the 2016 memes are becoming RL.
---
Your a knob.
---
there is some griefing and raiding and murdering..
---
food, water and waving is far more common...
---
trailer was nice though! I just wonder about gunplay and multiplayer connectivity
---
If it worked, you are right I would use them. If it worked.
---
Get a mic if you don't have one. So much more fun communicating with people.
---
Take your time in adventure mode and explore!!
---
I never get trade requests and am a huge trader. What platform are you on? I assume a console?
---
Never said they came from the vault,
---
Fucko
---
I'm hoping that in the future they'll have FO battle royale with a better engine and it'll be on the next gen consoles and there'll be 100 players. I'm also hoping we'll get to modify weapons and armor during the battle royale matches. And I want driveable cars and motorcycles, the ones we've been seeing for years in fallout but were never able to drive. I'm not a good PVP player but I still enjoy battle royale. I love PUBG. It feels so good to kill people in PUBG. I like battle royale much better than classic multiplayer games because there's more elements to it and it's more dramatic. You can search for loot, sneak around, hide, run away, and move to better locations in addition to shooting someone. It looks like in nuclear winter you'll have to decide whether to help someone kill a monster or not. It also be fun to attract a monster to another player by throwing a rock or something. Hopefully FO76 battle royale will be a big success and lead to better versions on the next gen consoles.
---
Yeah, because you know for a fact that the negative coverage over that isn't what pushed it off.
---
PlayStation
---
I'm highly disappointed. I was expected a Hardcore PvE experience with exaggerated weather effects. Or something similar to Fallout NV's Frost Survival Sim.
---
So does the vault act like a hub for players?
---
Where do you see 79?
---
Grind Forest-Horde events, get Lv10 Legendaries, Profit
---
They said in the E3 conference that it's a separate mode.
---
Aaaaaaaaaaand I'm homeless
---
No I'm not just salty that pvpers are getting acknowledged at all, I'm salty that instead of thinking of some way to make pvp more engaging....like I don't know instead of using a BR to get money instead put that money towards factions and a karma system? Just spit balling ideas here but more spit balling that "LETS MAKE A BR!" that was a meme around pubg time.
---
Haven't watched it yet, got the link?
---
I think you're onto something with the chimp thing, I can definitely see that in the long arms/hand-like feet as well as the facial structure. However, my guess would be FEV testing on chimps, rather than some sort of space-mutation.
---
Already started, which include but not limited to:
---
-should have had from beginning
---
-trying to save dead game
---
-imagine thinking this is a new feature
---
-etc.
---
I say that in the context of it sounding odd and kinda vapid from the outside-looking-in. Not that it's not relevant or anything, I totally get it but seeing it as some big new thing - which in this case, it is - if you had no idea what was going on, just made me laugh.
---
Damn missed out on that 10 buck bundle coming tomorrow. Unless you drop another 10 for it.
---
&gt; hating on the idea of br‚Ä¶
---
"What do you most enjoy in 76?"
---
* PVE: 65%
---
* PVP: 6%
---
( results from  https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bya94s/the_results_are_in_for_fallout_76_wild_appalachia/ )
---
ok, everything being launched now is technically "for free", we can't complain so much, but most of us would like the company uses their LIMITED resources (devs mostly) to improve the game in other areas, not in PVP or BR.
---
I am excited about all the news and the things to come to the game, except for the BR thing.
---
OH YES I AM COMING BACK!
---
What if I won 500 million and could make my own MMO?   What if it does bring any new revenue in and its a double down failure.  What happens to  Fo76 pve we all bought?  Will they triple down and do what they should have on the first past?  What if they do not?
---
The Hellfire suit looks like it's ready to take on the gundam
---
They said having no living humans was a part of the story, so it makes sense they planned this.
---
I've seen it on the fallout wiki but haven't seen any mentions other than youtube videos. Maybe this vault doesn't even exist. So they must have messed up.
---
Thanks for letting me know! I‚Äôm buying it right now as I type, watched the E3 trailers, I really can‚Äôt wait for it to finish downloading!
---
They do exist yes, but they are the extreme minority and the mechanics of the game make it harder and harder for them to grief and murder- pushing them into a steadily shrinking little corner where they'll be until they get bored.
---
Okay liberal
---
So with the free trial, people get to play 76 and nuclear winter for free for 1 week. After that one week, do people who own the game still to get to play nuclear winter?
---
I loved that too.
---
Then i saw the trailer for a battle royale mode. Something that I've never heard a single player talk about, amongst the hundreds I've met in my 185 levels.
---
High level vault raids, more boss fights and harder areas. More group activities like the parade. More crafting options and new weapons. Legendary power armor. Lots of suggestions. 
---
But here we are with a new Fortnite. The winner will be determined by who can stay connected long enough.
---
Shotgun to the legs. then move to other limbs.
---
You think there are players out there who would purchase Fallout 76 which is now famous for being a janky mess to play battle royale mode? When there are several extremely polished and free Battle Royale games out there already? Doubtful. Only people that   
---
 a **Fallout** BR game would appeal to is **existing** fallout fans and if those fans havent found anything to entice them enough to buy this game yet, BR sure as hell wont do it
---
fo76 is not an mmo
---
It will have lots of different dlc drops for nuclear winter. Vault raids were listed as content as well. Don't lose your head. Lol
---
59.77Gb Redownloading it atm. Nobody knows the exact time when the update is coming probably not even Bethesda.
---
oh. then idk, i keep hearing like frog noises even tho i'm no in that area where frogs or toads spawn
---
6/10-6/17 ITS HUNTING SEASON. THE QUARRY? *SNIFFS* FRESH NOOBS...
---
Burn the raiders to the ground, Ad Victoriam!!!
---
I'm OG xbox1 user. There are sections where it stutters, but that's to be expected in a nuke zone, with 16 players with TSE weapons all shooting at the Scorchbeast Queen. The first loading of the day is always interesting, as your character spawns into the world then all other aspects come in after, so, for instance, if you left at the Golf Course clubhouse, you appear there and if you go in it appears empty, but you may notice your health dropping. Then, maybe a minute later the ghouls appear, swarming you.
---
You get used to it, and generally start in a safe area, where you can sort out your scrap and junk before you venture out. With the new dlc announced it's probably good to slide on 8n now
---
I'm just here to say I was a 76 hater, and was very critical of FO4 ( even tho i eventually put over 1k hours into it LOL ) FO76's release broke my heart and made me think Bethesda was doubling down on making Fallout a generic shooter. This update with dialogue choices and NPC's has officially brought me back. I just purchased the game on Bethesda's store directly. I want to show Bethesda this is what I want from Fallout and reward them I'm so excited to start playing with you guys!
---
Was this said somewhere I didnt watch the whole conference? That sounds amazing the rp is coming and the npcs!
---
I've played it, I to say I dislike battle royal games is putting it mildly, but I have to say it was fucking awesome.    
---
[Bethesda hears us, I know because being an ‚Äúproductive pest‚Äù got me some screen time with Nuclear Winter.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/byrgfc/bethesda_hears_us_i_know_because_being_an/)
---
Unless you want to PvP (in which case there are other better games) there's very little competition that would hinder you for a "late start". If anything, the pioneers smoothed out the bugs and posted hints, if and when you need them.
---
I want a dog companion so much!  Traveling with a dog is essential Fallout to me.
---
oh no !
---
I knew someone was going to say that. "Mmo lite"
---
I found it,it's the fallout fanon wiki just a site for fan stuff like orginal OC do not steal stuff.
---
Oh man, they goofed up then. I didn't even do anything weird to find it, it was just at the bottom of the [Nuclear Winter Is Coming page](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/4f9q90xXpnRJ8vlIWVJxVK/fallout-76-nuclear-winter-is-coming) in [the news section.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/461221526629384192/587469718575775775/Weight2.png)
---
or they might get more creative...
---
Would have been mad if thats all they announced but they added npcs then this and I am extremely hype.
---
BR is played out.  Was popular.
---
Not really. I was being too optimistic about what I expected them to do. My opinion of JH hasn't changed, and not quite as dumb as going back a month for a "told ya so".
---
So, here's your cookie: üç™
---
Same, on PC I'm Meidara, add me and join me if you see me.
---
I definitely like the PvE elements being incorporated, that's a really original take. Pair that with Animal Friend/Wasteland Whisperer and you could potentially be real dangerous to other players...
---
just use unyielding
---
Same. I‚Äôm next to the Sutton Station away from the house that‚Äôs nearby, just in case.
---
I'm not talking about the update, I'm talking about the free week.
---
Don‚Äôt rush the campaign
---
Are we sure this isn't just a glitched ghoul?
---
I was really mixed on the game up until Wild Appalachia. The quality, design, and writing for the free DLC has been pretty good overall, the way they're able to quietly release updates makes the game feel a bit more dynamic and interesting. The game's improved quite a bit. Still has a ways to go, but it's on an incredibly positive path.
---
Also, there is a regular bow and arrow shown in the trailer.
---
Yeah! this community is small but very friendly.
---
That's exactly what I did. Traded it in for scrip, went to Berkeley Springs and got something better.
---
I have the one x and it runs just fine. Not sure about the base model though.
---
It‚Äôs just like anything in life; we all have our opinions. I talk about playing the game all the time and if anyone comments negatively I explain why I like it and usually end it with ‚Äúto each their own.‚Äù But bottom line is I really don‚Äôt give a crap, I have been having fun so that‚Äôs all that really matters.
---
mods would have worked better and released more by now
---
Holy shit son!
---
Yep
---
Todd Howard IS an NPC.  Fixed it.
---
I've played it, check my posts.    
---
Generally I've avoided Battle Royal games and I love the F*{^} out of it
---
Hopefully the servers don‚Äôt disconnect!!!!!
---
Actually, I think the Inferno might be a totally different thing! If you watch the Dev Diary video they mention unlocking additional skins for your power armor- and if you look at them, they show three different styles, or possibly 'marks'. I think the Inferno itself is just a skin for existing armor, the Hellfire is likely an entirely new set.
---
Guess I'm going to have to move the Pistols and Pianos Dueling Piano Bar over towards Vault 76
---
Yes!!!
---
Meh.
---
My only interest in the battle royale would be to get whatever is unique about it that I can take back to the regular game, plans or recipes or whatever.  
---
But I have really no interest in PVP.
---
Hype !!
---
ok i need to be real, 60 is not that much, some even go to 100 damn gigs, and they are regular everyday AAA games.  Also, that would be ur pc and internet for the week thang but yeah they have the stock to make everyone come back again
---
Not my special stats? So like my cards and perks that make my character unique and custom. So basically appearing cosmetically?
---
Really? Ive seen plenty of people asking for a game mode that sets everyone at base level and just battle it out. People set up fight clubs on their own xD
---
inb4 someone tells you to go play fallout 4 after some sarcastic comment.
---
Pshhh. Dont listen to him. Grab ALL your junk and follow me... into this dark alleyway...
---
you truly are the dumbest player of this game.
---
Maybe. This thing is quite red though, like a fire; an "Inferno", if you will, hehe.
---
I've played it, trust me it will make sense once you can as well
---
It's horrible lore wise and all, but as long as we get to use it I don't think a single person is going to care
---
its tradition. and more marketing branches to swing from;
---
I mean I could think of a reason or two üòÇ It wasn‚Äôt best recurved and they‚Äôd want to keep new players in
---
*sniffs* it smell like bitch in here!
---
Hey! I love joining someone to do some trading and seeing 5+ friends online on 1 server. Its great
---
[Sarcastic] Cowabunga it is
---
Lmao how long have you been working at Bethesda
---
Oh yeah, I had to turn off chat in the stream I was watching the E3 reveal on
---
So many game devs in this sub, it's insane
---
Thanks for your diligence with the bug reports. My main question is why haven't they fixed so many of the easy ones?
---
I completely agree! ‚ÄúAcquire‚Äù shouldn‚Äôt matter how you get it.
---
The Mann ain‚Äôt lying. I don‚Äôt want to play fallout with a bunch of 12 year olds because they implemented BR. It‚Äôs going to bring them to what was a super helpful, relatively mature community. What‚Äôs next? Gay-ass dancing. We gonna get the dab pose now for the camera? Fuck.
---
It's a better value than previously, that's for sure. $10 USD for a PA skin and a cool coat ain't bad.
---
I doubt it.
---
They can't damage people with pacifist on. They can't damage camps. Npcs are immortal. Quest items are instanced. 
---
Unless you willingly enter a pvp area, they cant touch you now.
---
I know everyone's gonna be mad about the retcon, but I personally am not bothered. Y'all had the same reaction to the Brotherhood of Steel being in the game and their inclusion Actually Made Sense. I'm sure there's gonna be some kind of explanation for why it's there (I dunno, maybe the Enclave got their hands on the schematics for the Appalachian version and started working on an improved version that became the Enclave Hellfire armor)
---
To see if a game we own is worth playing yet, or to get a rough idea of when it might be....
---
The fact you can‚Äôt imagine someone not being here for a circlejerk says a lot about how fan/fuckboi this whole sub has gotten.
---
NPC Settlements. Probably gonna be the new hub zone
---
You have a little over an hour to go, based on Eastern Standard Time. 10:42 pm right now.
---
&gt;These are rhetorical questions as I can see you are not asking yours to learn but to try and direct a point.
---
Uhh, yeah they **were** rhetorical. And?....
---
oh fuck no, that's exactly what's going to happen: "FALLOUT 76 NEW BATTLE ROYALE MODE, GOES FREE TO PLAY" with a thumbnail of the vault boy with the upside down smile and thumbs down
---
Why the hate?
---
Hunting? Pfft I'm joining
---
Can't wait for the inevitable "happily minding my own business when I suddenly get swarmed by a herd of horror monsters and scream like a little girl"
---
&gt;If so i wonder why the station? Or maybe there will be multiple locations and they figured space station woukd be cool
---
Thinking as a survivor in this world, it's a safe bet that the station has a nuclear power source, so if you can harness it you can provide power to your town. Also, it was presumably built to protect the astronauts from space radiation, so if you can get into the thing it shuttle protect you from the residual nuke radiation. 
---
All in all, it seems like a decent place to set up a home.
---
Eh... best to leave that until I hit level 30.
---
Mind linking it. I'm hoping that I just missed it.
---
And they are..every patch...if you play the game and enjoy the game like I do all news is good news. We could be in anthem players shoes. Fine br doesn‚Äôt excite you. They gave us pve content to look forward to. NPCs! Can you imagine what it will take for them to code their typically single player engine in a way that works for NPCs? But they are making it happen bc we asked for it.
---
So, they're ignoring the other half of the announcement, the part where you're getting a normal fallout game as well?
---
During the reveal, the twitch chat was a giant spam of "FORTNITE 76 OMEGALUL"
---
Of course!! I love it!!
---
They all go hand in hand. You see low health you know they have adrenal reaction/nerd rage/any dodge perk, you know they also have a bloodied weapon cause it fits the build.  You see sent/cav armor, its probably unyielding/assassin/lower bolstering. It's all broken without bugs. The thing is Huge difference when I have to shoot you twice and you have to shoot me once. That's not a fight, that's just suicide by other person.
---
I am pumped. I stopped playing a long time ago. Never got to level 15. I‚Äôm returning for this patch no doubt. So happy about human NPCs
---
I'm happy that they're adding NPCs  I fell off fo76 a while back though. Even with this new content the outer worlds is something I'll be dedicating my spare time with
---
you dont think your jumping into it a bit to fast? who knows, this could be an all news campaign ish type mode, same open world, combat etc but single player, maybe up to 4 players, friends ofc and its offline basically. did you hear how they described it at the e3 conference? doesnt sound like them describing a new update. sounds like them describing the other half of the game we all wanted.
---
I don‚Äôt want to know and Beth can keep it! üôàüôàüôà
---
The owner of that PA will return in a few months, and he's going to kick your ass.  Sleep with one eye open.
---
I'm hoping the NPCs recognize whether or not the player as discovered radshield or the cure, and some of them respond accordingly. It'd offer a lot more reasons that now the humans have a fighting chance. Before, just fighting the Scorched risked you becoming one, but now...
---
It'll be curious to see how they handle it.
---
Perhaps you misspelled "hug." Would you like one? ü§ó
---
I'm a bot, and I like to give hugs. [source](https://github.com/as-com/reddit-hug-bot) | [contact](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=as-com)
---
It will probably start in about 11 hours, that's their regular "update time"
---
The overseer better show up
---
"Makes 76 basically what fans wanted" 
---
you "nothing"
---
your a blank minded robot.
---
I'm on mobile so I don't really know how.  It was on one of the inside the vaults.
---
But this game is classified M. Fortnite and Apex are T. I know that's not a law, but I think the lore is disturbing (even disgusting) for immature unsupervised minds. COD appeal a lot of young edgie people, but it seems is not the case for FO76. I think on PC the playerbase's age is adequate. Maybe is not on consoles.
---
 Did i make a typo that triggered you?  Sorry.   There is a website that provides that service www.dictionary.com/.
---
Honestly I have. But the thing is I enjoy it, the friends I've met and played with online like it, and I like playing it by myself as well. So fuck them, have fun with the game you like. The community that does play is great, so I'd just keep going along and having the best time I can.

### NUCLEAR WINTER
---
#### RELEASE: SUMMER 2019
---
Summer will bring another series of major updates to Fallout 76, including **Nuclear Winter** \- an entirely new way to play that changes the rules of the wasteland.
---
* **New Game Mode: Nuclear Winter** ‚Äì An entirely new way to play Fallout 76, completely changing the rules of the Wasteland.
---
* **New Vault Raids: Vaults 96 and 94 Opening** ‚Äì For our most seasoned players, test your strength in all new high-level group Vault Raids.
---
* **New Feature: Legendary Players** ‚Äì An all-new prestige system will allow players above level 50 to become Legendary, resetting their characters with all new more powerful abilities.
---
Straight from the roadmap.
---
It's a 3\* ranged weapon. I imagine there are many players who would have loved to have received this as a reward... perhaps instead of a 1\* Nocturnal Board or a 1\* Nocturnal Rolling Pin... or, god forbid, a Drill...
---
Edgy isn't about what is being said, but how it is being said. And in this case, also about douchey behaviour towards people simply trying to enjoy what they love. Is it that hard to let bygones be bygones and simply not be "snarky" and negative towards a topic and chain of comments that had the purpose of enjoying something? If you don't like it, go talk about how you don't like it elsewhere. In a post meant to be overtly negative, instead of trying to drag everyone else down with you. It's not a difficult concept to grasp.
---
At the end of the day, you like your things and dislike your things. Everyone else is the same way, and so just let them like their things. Find people with a shared dislike or like and convey this to them. Ya know?
---
That said, management of those things weren't affected. People who are good at working on a BR mode wouldn't be put on a team meant for non-pvp stuff anyways. And money? They're managing money quite well if they're putting some focus into a team for this. Appealing to the perceived desires of the PvP as well as the PvE audience. I might not be a big shot video game designer, but I have dabbled in programming with small teams of friends on personal projects and delegating tasks to the people best suited for them is what any group would do. As such, a professional team is most definitely doing that. You simply just don't know what you're talking about and wish to bring everyone down with you because you dislike what you see. There is no need for it, and honestly? You should just find something to be happy about and stick to that because otherwise you'll just keep being miserable with the direction things go when it doesn't go your way.
---
((A side note, the people working on the BR mode are already on salary anyways, likely as the PvP designers. So, better to put them to work on something than keep them being paid but doing nothing. Right? Afterall, time and money management is important. Wouldn't you agree?))
---
Just remember folks smile and wave and then go about rebuilding your weird house with 6 braham in the basement
---
10:30 CST
---
&gt;I didn't say that people would buy the game just for BR mode, but having a BR mode on top of the core game will
---
So youre saying the thing that will finally push players that arent interested in the Fallout series to finally buy Fallout 76 is the BR mode? That is so silly to think that nothing was able to entice them to buy the game yet but BR will be the thing that does it. No ones going to stop playing Fortnite or Apex and leave all their friends and a hugely popular community to go and play some BR mode set in a game series they dont give a damn about. Unless theyre ALREADY a fan off Fallout. Thats like saying people are finally going to give Anthem a try once they come out wth a BR mode.
---
Is there a BR game that has AI creatures/monsters that can kill you and /or drop loot? That alone seems like a fun differentiation from most BR games.
---
COUNTRY ROADS TAKE ME HOME!!!!
---
You'd think you would have learned to not project your opinion onto everybody else. I loved everything that was released so far, no reason to hate that.
---
Man, I wish we could buy atoms here in Japan. No way for us to access this content.
---
30 years, they wont feed me! Halp skynet!!
---
Watch carefully for the differences between this and past fallout games. There are massive changes to certain weapons and mods (i.e drum mags for combat shotgun and pipe rifle add like 4 bullets instead of 30), perks, even the junk that items have (tin cans now have lead and steel, which are btw far more useful now). Take nothing for granted, and if something seems off, search for a thread about it here
---
oof
---
I have mixed feelings about the lore-breaking presence of the Hellfire armor.
---
^^Honestly, ^^that ^^was ^^my ^^biggest ^^takeaway ^^from ^^this, ^^so ^^do ^^with ^^that ^^what ^^you ^^will.
---
Yup.  This and No Man's Sky were mediocre to total disasters at launch but it looks like both games after some time will end up being really good.
---
Half price on regular game and Bicentennial Edition at PS Store right now as well.
---
Yeah. I picked up the game at launch and while I didn't full-on hate it, it was definitely my least favorite Fallout and by Christmas I felt pretty done with it. Haven't played a ton but picked it back up again since Wild Appalachia and it feels like it's mostly moving in the right direction, but still has some problems. 
---
NPCs, proper factions, dialogue? This is 100% a massive step in the right direction. Nail the story and I'm sold.
---
Hahaha! At first I died a lot. Like, a TON. But Morgantown is a godsend, there is PLENTY of junk around for you to use to build a nice CAMP, build some nice weapons, and build up a stockpile of chems and stims that you can use en masses in harder areas. None of the enemies ever really get above level 9 feral ghouls, so even very squishy players like me could survive using melee weapons and hoarding ammo and chems. I was content to stay in or very close to Morgantown until I hit level 30 or so and had my perks tuned well enough that even butt makes it was like I was in power armor. Now I stay over by Whitespring Station or Hemlock Holes, depending on if I‚Äôm farming or selling.
---
Not a lie, they also said they would add them if people wanted. They were going to hear community feedback and go from there.
---
Its easy.  Go slow and enjoy the game.
---
It looked exactly like the thing from lucky hole mine
---
Npcs are coming back... wondering if the pickpocket skill and npc becoming hostile for stealing their stuff are coming too ü§î
---
They improved energy and heavy a few patches ago.
---
Ye, it's mode for steals snipers i think
---
You have a terrible personality.
---
That creature looked exactly like the one in the boyo of lucky hole mine. I wonder if we will get more interloper development?
---
That is my only problem with this new mode I am not a fan of Battle Royale. I don't want to be forced to do it to get better Perks or to open up new playstyles
---
At least you admit you‚Äôre an employee.
---
Who would win a level 5 Vault Dweller or a level 200 Bloodied Stealth Commando ??
---
Ebay probably
---
And how does it work in other mmo?
---
Lucky you, you've got a free week to decide...
---
How the fuck does this toxic, exclusionary shit get upvoted?
---
I agree! The Fallout Twist. So wait till someone gets tangled up with an AI and backstab him? I cant wait. Gonna be a whole new level of meatballing
---
I killed a 3 Star albino sheepquatch only for my internet to crash before I could loot it
---
That would work perfectly!
---
It's a slap in the face. I paid top caps for some of these.
---
You see 100+ players??? I log in and see about 8. everyday, Theres almost no one playing
---
Thank you for sharing!
---
It saddens me that corporations are restricted from valuable feedback because of the 'crazies.' I know, I work for such an entity. One that really, really wants to hear from our consumers, but we have to protect ourselves. It sounds simple, and it is, but it would blow your mind if you only knew how many crazies we have reporting back to us and how insane their feedback is. 
---
You are very lucky,
---
Most people that work for a popular company are happy to be there and really want the best for the company. They have and take pride in their work. I respect that. The thing is. catering to your consumers is far more difficult than you think. I think a corporation must listen intently to their consumers and have the ability to make changes very quickly. 
---
Easier said than done. 
---
So many 'rules' are put into place to protect themselves that, because of the 'crazies,' it becomes extremely difficult to operate as efficiently as they would desire. So I applaud the FO76 fans that have the patience to either wait it out or pursue serious issues.
---
I tucked myself by the mistress of mysteries mansion. I figure it's a little less likely for them to add something big in a large row of houses.
---
Chalkboard would work pretty dang good!
---
Yeah this would be a great way to add a bit more player interaction.
---
That‚Äôs what made me think it but I couldn‚Äôt be sure if it was just a regular enemy or a player in raider gear.
---
Imma nab me a two shot explosion bow then!
---
Stealthy boomboom
---
I have a question. I bought it months ago for me and my girlfriend because I trusted the opinions in this reddit that the game was better than before.
---
10 minutes in we recognized that the questsystem is awkwardly unoptimized. We were in one team. Both of us had the same quest activated so we thought it was like in borderlands were we shared quest objectives... but it wasnt. We both had to find the quest objectives for ourselves, like a panel, a note ect. It was even worse with 4 people. It is hardly possible to do the same quest with 4 people. Everything must be found fourth times, its stupid asf.
---
Is this still an issue? I watched the E3 trailer and wanted to jump in again but not with unbearable quest-system.
---
I may have to move my CAMP to Vault 76 and roll out the welcome wagon. And by welcome wagon, I mean free Nukashine.
---
when is the trail going live at what time?
---
PC? Xbox? PS4?
---
Even better idea! I like that.
---
Ps4
---
 60 is an absolute fuckton when you've only got about 10 or 11 gigs free across your whole system and nothing's really deletable. Also a massive fucking problem when the best internet you can get at your address is 7 down 1 up ADSL.
---
It‚Äôs definitely not bad for the game as a whole regardless of whether you pvp or not.
---
The one with the bot I think is teasing to automatron. I think the game has been teasing it for a while now with the sheepsquatch and the protection with the robobrain treads
---
Lol!!
---
Already working on my camp beside the overseers camp :)
---
What part of "THIS MODE ONLY" is so fucking hard to understand?
---
Lmao! Yah!
---
I do not want to turn a corner in a dark remote part of the map and have that come around a tree.
---
Give me more fallout eldritch pls
---
So what do you do if you die? Start another match?
---
Youre 100% right, no one that isnt already a fan of Fallout is going to give a damn about this BR mode. Imagine players leaving their friends and their popular, well polished and free to play BR game to go and play some game in a game series they dont care about which  on top of that, is the laughing stock of the gaming community.
---
?
---
*juicehead intensifies*
---
Told ya so?
---
And that‚Äôs a valid concern. I‚Äôm still upset with how Epic all but dropped Save the World in favor of the money press that was BR.
---
We‚Äôll see how it pans out with BGS Dallas
---
I'm sure you would read some funny shit.
---
Not even joking. I've sat around and adventured with many. On Reddit, yes, but nobody in game.
---
I've heard people say Survival should have required a fresh start and i agree there. But a battle royale? Never.
---
You are an exception to the rule!;).   
---
The project leads flew in, but the office in Dallas seemed to be primarily focused on '76 at that point, we met with some of the QA team, content people etc, who were primarily in the Austin or Dallas area.
---
Because the more time and money they spend on a BR mode means the less they spend on fixing the game they underdelivered at launch and still continue to do so
---
Speak in absolute now, but if it ends up bringing extra revenue for the studio that you all claim to support - what's the harm? Again, I don't understand the fury that comes with a free, optional  &amp; low effort game mode that's tossed into an already full fledged game. What's the actual harm? If they end up profiting from this and thus can put more money into R&amp;D and game dev, wouldn't everyone be happier? I swear everyone's so obsessed/elitist with everything that Bethesda does nowadays. God forbid your game studio wants to put out some preliminary content while your wait for their next AAA titles to drop.
---
could this be the interloper?
---
I think I'm making a joke ;)
---
I'd really encourage you to give it another go now, especially if you stopped after the rocky launch. The last few patches have been very positive steps forward for the game. Wild Appalachia was a great boost and got several of my friends back into the game. Either way, welcome home!
---
My kid did that to me. She put "I shit the bed" where you lay down.
---
Best bot is best!
---
I have no idea what your talking about. Maybe quit being so vague. If it's about the FREE update we get tomorrow why not just try it before you give it failing grade. It's free after all.
---
That will depend upon how Bethesda sets this up. Usually if you die, yes. Start another match.
---
Why would people pay for a BR game by a developer who has had so much trouble providing a decent multiplayer experience?
---
First of, they're not "betting on BR", it's an extra free game mode for people who want it.
---
Second, name a single fucking studio that "has gone bankrupt chasing Fortnite." you can't, because you're full of shit.
---
Your post is bad and you should feel bad.
---
It looks like those are its arms its walking with, its legs are tucked underneath
---
The factions coming in Wastelanders are settlers vs raiders
---
It‚Äôs definitely a raider and imma hunt me down some raiders for... unsightly reasons...
---
Also dafuq was that stiltwalker ghoul thing!
---
What will be the motivation to kill lots of Vault-dwellers if your goal is to be an overseer and lead Vault-dwellers. I don't think story will be the strong suit for the battle royale mode.
---
Yep, which means combat is a lot more likely and the current max is 32 by the way, but getting that is near impossible.
---
You'll be completely fine. Just take it slow and enjoy looking at everything, there is no rush and do whatever you want. More than likely you will get handouts from higher levels.
---
Yeah. I played PUBG. Then returned to fallout 4. Then I played apex. Then returned to fallout 76. Now? Well fuck.
---
Again I maintain that this title should not have been made a canon entry.
---
Being an online game we WANT all the cool shit, ALL OF IT, but no one wants constant retcons just to have it.
---
Jesus fucking Christ. You seriously think those are all new perk cards? The only new ones are the ones that only apply to that mode, the remainder are just a selection of perks from the main game.
---
my husband accidentally kicked me off the team twice today. I then declined his invite twice cause I‚Äôm petty.
---
That would be a good idea!
---
Thought i was the only one who did this, though its usually any player that has a bounty less than 20
---
It looks fun, I'll play it. At the very least it forced Bethesda to prioritize balancing and PVP issues.
---
Fallout Yelp! Lmao! Exactly!
---
Well maybe you shouldn't buy video games.
---
Listen if a business gets shammed into fixing a false advertising on something I paid 200 dollars for, I get to be as snarky as I want about an ad on a stage people paid money to see. 
---
As for the "Don't like it don't talk about it" I swear reddit has gotten so weak lately, its a fallout 76 reddit not a 'only positive news' site ran by bethesda.  If a company puts resources into a BR (That I don't even think fallout 76 can support with as smooth of a gameplay as they showed on the trailer; not like E3 has lied before or anything) those resources and programmers' time is tied up instead of either fixing things or better ideas. I am sad that a franchise I've loved since the 90s is turning in an old "Lets make a BR game" meme from 2017 instead of doing something interesting like a faction system and karma for PVP. You know that RP that was in the G? 
---
"As such, a professional team is most definitely doing that." I doubt you are a professional with unlimited resources because even the government doesn't have that and they have an army. Even they have to pick and choose what resources to put where and seeing an RPG getting a battleroyal makes me sad instead of a nuclear winter...that I don't know is a winter map with a cold factor and an ashy sky?
---
"A side note, the people working on the BR mode are already on salary anyways, likely as the PvP designers. So, better to put them to work on something than keep them being paid but doing nothing. Right?" 
---
You act as if people can't be paid to work on something else, like I fell through the map last time I played; pay them to help fix with that or if they are game play designers tell them to think of some faction gameplay...or put them in a studio to read lines for NPC dialog. See I can think of many other ways than a BR to sell skins to chase the fortnite market.
---
I think Todd addressed this pretty well though: the people in this game will mostly just give you water and wave at you. The people who get their kicks out of ruining other people's fun don't have much to do here. They could have moved on to survival, but I feel like a majority just got bored and left. The f2p week will surely bring some back, but afterwards it should be clear
---
Lol fake ass poster. Check the subreddits history, just because the good news bears came out today doesn‚Äôt mean my statement doesn‚Äôt match a vast majority of the player bases opinion and feelings. 
---
‚ÄúGive a shit about how fast I beat the boss‚Äù
---
I 100%ed the game with a group of friends a long ass time ago. I came to this thread to see if they were actually releasing anything- when all I see is that they still don‚Äôt know what direction to go. Nobody wants PvP, yet they drop a fuckin BR lol. I‚Äôll stop here, enjoy fallout 4 online EA edition
---
correct my friend, true and  you are real and factual
---
love to bethesda
---
Clearly people think it's a bad thing I want a totally offline game so itt'l probably happen sooner rather than later. And I'll tell them I have been and that it doesn't change my thoughts on 76. My biggest problems with the game are the lack of NPCs/quests/dialog(which they're fixing), the multiplayer aspect(I play Fallout to escape multiplayer), mods(Love my mods), devconsole(Because Gamebryo)...
---
Oh sweet! Didn‚Äôt know that was confirm or hadn‚Äôt really seen it detailed. Thanks!
---
Amazon, physical copy is $17.99, you won't find it cheaper. 
---
You'll need to add something to qualify for free shipping though. 
---
I needed honey mustard, so grabbed a pack of that to make the shipping free, heh. (bought myself a second copy for a mule account)
---
No I don‚Äôt think that there are 73 NeW pErK CArdS i aM noT StUPiD.
---
Sexxxyyyy
---
I know can't believe I'm being forced to play üò≠üò≠üò≠
---
No kidding. Wtf!?!
---
Or take a workshop.  Or run into savvy folks with bounties
---
[](/crazypie)That comes out tomorrow.
---
That they would. But I'd ignore that crap. Lol.
---
Use the launcher to submit a ticket. They were super quick with my 500 atoms.
---
Right at the very bottom, June 10, 2019. That is the date that that article is ment to be published. The big " do not publish" right at the start of the article should have told you not to buy it yet
---
The cringe is real.
---
All I want to know is are there any rewards/benefits to completing it and becoming the Overseer that carry over to the Adventure mode.  If there are none, I won't bother with it.
---
Where was the anti material rifle?
---
Tomorrow I believe. I'm still curious to see what all this new patch will entail. Also I want to know about the other vault that suppose to open as well that is a Pve 4 player raid. Hopefully tomorrow we will know more.
---
It would be very nice!
---
I've Alpha'd and Beta'd my share of games as well, and think of how often leaks occur....  
---
 
---
It can and hopefully will get better, but it's a step in the right direction if nothing else.  
---
Before agreeing to go I made it clear if this was a focus group or a PR event to count me out.  
---
I honestly don't think this was about PR, the rest of us discussed the idea of posting and I was the only one at this time willing to step forward, and since most of the NDA expired tonight the timing seemed sound.  
---
Your not going to see Bethesda posting pictures,'and I don't think other than confirming it happened they will discuss it.
---
How much **exactly** will that extra time and money be? For all we know it it made perfect financial sense to them, or it could be such a low effort change (the core game is already a PvP game, bringing in BR is merely a superficial change to the game mode) that they thought to might as well throw it in there to serve FO76 players who **would** like a BR mode.
---
Everyone speaks in absolute terms with zero insights into Bethesda's financials/analysis of the player base. I'm not even claiming that it's the right move for them - I'm just saying that they must have had good reasons to introduce it in the game. And they are not even forcing it on anyone - it is **free and optional.**
---
 How are "good news" that they are wasting their resources in an unwanted feature by me and apparently +95% of the real Fallout fans in the place of producing healthy content?
---
 All the rest of the news are great. I will wait for everything else to show up.
---
Thanks for the info!!
---
No, it says it is now available
---
Bought on sight! Also bonus repair kits, nice!
---
The Scorchbeast Nests in Watoga (the ones at the top of several buildings, they're very similar looking to Deathclaw nests) frequently have Scorchbeast parts in them, good way to get those one or two last bits you need!
---
How do I do that?
---
Then why isnt there a multiplayer survival for fallout 4 that has NPCs and everything everyone ever wanted?  Also why don't any of the mods that make maps a quarter the size of 76 ever get released?
---
Cool. I will probably be on until noonish EST, then hop off for a bit till late evening EST.
---
Mixed opinions on this. I don't like BR, but this genuinely looks interesting. The new gear looks cool, and it seems pretty well balanced based on what they described. My only issue with the balance is they said you unlock perks for playing, and they made it sound like you will permanently unlock perks that give you an advantage once you've played a lot of the mode. Also, walking arsenal sounds like the best thing ever. Also a bit disappointing is that you will have to play this mode (probably a lot of it) to fully unlock vault 51, but hopefully it doesn't require wins, maybe just getting enough kills or surviving long enough.
---
Oh, and vats will not work against players! That's such a relief.
---
I‚Äôm not gonna lie. I didn‚Äôt like the way that fallout 76 looked as far as story goes. But I just watched the premier for year 2 and I‚Äôm quite impressed and really want to get it now. I‚Äôm not a battle royale fan but this sounds super fun in a fallout standpoint. Also I‚Äôm pretty excited that humans are going to be present. So I may have to actually get it. It all around looked great so now I gotta find a team when I get it.
---
I actually think your close to the core issue.
---
What is happening?
---
Via the launcher. Support i think it is.
---
&gt;So i havn't played since a few months after launch. Is power armor still nearly required for rad protection in nuke zones, or is it actually possible to be a non power armor build?
---
Is possible, but it's incredibly hard to do without attacking all the rad resists, having read reduction in your armor, and having a teammate to skate level 3 rad sponge.
---
I am concerned how camps will work between modes. They said you can use blueprinted camps from Adventure, but what if I make a new turret camp in BR and go back. My main camp is max-budget decorated. With it being a beta as well, I am guessing people will have to rebuild their adventure camps. I think I may do it regardless though to unlock all the new camp plans.
---
My first thought was that this beast is Centaur member of the Harlem Globe Trotters.
---
I will be shocked if we don‚Äôt DC 48 times a day or have ‚Äúworld full‚Äù every time we try and join a friend‚Äôs server lol.
---
1. Since everything was holotapes and bots they could just change the world and a new player does the old quests in the new map. The problem with that being new players don't get the original experience and that version of the game is essentially gone.
---
2. Alternatively new players could be in the current map until they complete a certain main story quest and then upon the next login they go to the new one with npcs. There could even be an option upon logging in after you've reached that point which version you want to join. The problem there being an increase in server requirements on Bethesda's end having to run both maps. Also more division in the playerbase if you get to pick which map and if you don't get to pick there would be even more empty and barren maps for new people if everyone who completed a certain quest could never go back.
---
Simplest one is option 1 and is what my money is on. MMOs with instancing could do option 2 with less troubles, but Fo76 doesn't have that choice.
---
Maybe because they could‚Äôve spent their time creating a different game mode instead of trying to follow the mass trend of battle royale. This whole game exists as a rejection of everything we‚Äôve grown to love about fallout. Let‚Äôs abandon single player story driven narrative to create an MMO with Battle Royale. How is that not harmful for the quality of the fallout franchise (I‚Äôm not talking about money) im talking about quality. Let me ask you one thing. If this was the first Fallout game that you ever played what would you think of the fallout series? Or better yet, if this was the first Fallout game ever made.
---
Yes NPC's, soon ;)
---
Yup, heres part of the description from the YouTube trailer. 
---
One year after the opening of Vault 76, other humans have returned to Appalachia. Factions of Settlers and Raiders aim to make the world their own and claim a rumored fortune...
---
What prevents someone from just hiding in a corner until the other guy gives up and you win after everyone else shoots each other?
---
Sounds fun though, I‚Äôm interested
---
It's still buggy, but improved a lot.
---
Thanks man! Ill look into it.
---
It's not like the game has been lacking in content post-launch either so it's not like the BR mode was a huge undertaking.
---
When in the video does it say 79?
---
Yes. Exactly! That's why I thought of it. Because of that very reason.
---
get ready to spam the wave emote!
---
I don‚Äôt wanna run into that alone... and if it‚Äôs like other enemies it comes in different flavors...
---
Oops thought it was 24.
---
I despise the Futnut community, but that dosn't mean the premise of the game is inherantly flawed.
---
Participation award for BGS!
---
How many caps would you be willing to just give away?
---
Ah! Yup that lines it out pretty clear! Thanks!
---
I was so in the same boat, it's why I put up the post that started all of this (my involvement), hell the reach out about the NDA I was considering walking away because I still hadn't heard anything back, but there has been progress.  
---
You know those revisions to the release notes on the patches?   
---
That's us calling them out on things they forgot to mention, unadvertised changes etc...
---
No human NPCs is the #1 reason I didn't buy FO76 but I've been waiting for it to get better. This might be enough but I'm going to wait for reviews.
---
Yikes. I guess the best part about this update is I won't have to run into people like you while I'm playing it.
---
Will add! Super down!
---
Just sit back and enjoy the game. I think a free week starts tm if you want your friends to join you... aswell as a battle royal mode coming tm as well.
---
Ok, this is epic
---
LOL - I should have waited until AFTER the E3 announcement...
---
Yeah, I was wondering how we do that
---
You‚Äôre 100% counting them right now aren‚Äôt you....
---
600-1000
---
Look at the publish date on the right, E3 2019 | Fallout 76
---
**June 10**, 2019
---
By Bethesda Game Studios  
---
It's the 9th
---
Festering glowing stiltwalker!
---
The article title? "DO NOT PUBLISH CELEBRATE BE3 2019 WITH THE E3 ATOM BONUS BUNDLE"
---
Don't get turned off by the main quest. It is pretty boring. However there are so many other amazing parts of the game like side quests and events. Exploring Unique locations and finding awesome loot. It's a really epic world what that mean quest he's a bit of a dud.
---
As long as they're done well I won't hate. I didn't buy this game because there weren't human NPCs and that was important to me. Obviously there were other reasons as well but that was the big one. If this ends up being good I might finally buy the game. But I'm going to wait for reviews first and see how it does.
---
Common sense? What does that even mean? You could just as easily done a beserkers build.
---
It‚Äôs weird. Maybe it depends on your level or what progress you‚Äôve made in the quest lines that pit you with people? I say this because my main in level 101ish and each time I spawn in regardless of time or day it‚Äôs a full server or near full with players most of which being higher levels (50+) but once a day I‚Äôll jump in with a new character (trying to different build set without waiting on my main to level out perks I don‚Äôt have) and there will be almost no one on. It‚Äôs weird ü§î
---
Yeah, I've heard. The BR looks eh, but I am excited for the NPCs.
---
Then that is their fault for posting it early and not informing the public.
---
Yep they‚Äôre pretty good but they tend to break quicker. A lot of people run Bloodied Explosive. I have a 3* BE Laser Rifle , only pull it out for fun because I‚Äôm a BE Rifleman Vat Crit Sneak Build üòé
---
61.6gb here, might be a bit bigger after the update though. Usually we have updates on Tuesday mornings but they made it sound like nuclear winter will be available as soon as the free week starts
---
Now I actually have to upgrade my charisma lol
---
Anyone else notice the thermal lance???? Super hyped!
---
Who are we to judge whether or not they are wasting their resources? Also, as a studio Bethesda has given us games with mechanics we didn‚Äôt ask for or know we would like. That  then turned out to be huge AAA titles. Maybe have some trust. If they weren‚Äôt making games so well this sub wouldn‚Äôt exist. Just bc we didn‚Äôt ask for it doesn‚Äôt mean we won‚Äôt like it.
---
Patch 10 is addressing some of that clunky feeling. I'm excited to see how combat feels afterwards.
---
In all honesty it's pve and already pretty bad so who cares.
---
I'll definitely check it out. Thanks!
---
i'm also EST, so that works out well. i have nothing else to do tomorrow since the fiance is out of town for work, so it all depends on how the game is panning out for me. it's only 11, so i very well may start it up when it's done downloading. thanks again, i'm looking forward to it!
---
No harming in playing it, you know
---
I think it will be fun
---
Ah, rip. I know the Atoms Shop has a Mothman statue and its description is something like ‚Äúmaybe it has its own secrets‚Äù or something so I thought there might be something important.
---
I'm unfortunately on Xbox. I really appreciate the offer!
---
Had a few beers tonight and this gave me chills! Probably gonna be dissapointed though.
---
*waves*
---
For adding NPCs, a thing literally every other games already had and a BR mode ? Fucking lol.
---
They can‚Äôt kill you unless your on a team or shoot back
---
It looks amazing. I'm excited as hell for it. Plus itll be nice kind of having something to do other than grinding and events all day.
---
Never played the game ans have mostly been put off by it, I'm somewhat excited to play it free tomorrow to give it a try
---
Thanks for the heads up. Thought I was just missing something huge.
---
I'm on Xbox. I really appreciate the offer!
---
They actually changed the title, and posted it publicly about 20 mins ago...
---
Please go back to fallout 2 style.  These empty FPSs are ruining the franchise
---
Since im a raider, the responders will be considered an enemy. This would be the same with other factions. But, this would mean im neutral to the raiders. Hell, there could be a events that are specific for the raiders, like the enclave has their specific events.
---
I mean, I agree with at least the first and third of those points, and the cynical part of me believes the middle. They should have been there from the beginning, NPCs in the game shouldn't be a novelty, and they're adding them because people demanded them and there was criticism. It's the reason I haven't yet bought the game, but if this fixes things I will.
---
this sub is **nowhere near** the majority of the playerbase lol
---
There is, look up skyrim together. There literally has been a multiplayer mod support since before fo76 even came out for the Creation engine.
---
I think this advice might be the best so far. Thanks.
---
[I don't think that shows up for everyone](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/461221526629384192/587476910729330689/hellfire.png).
---
I think it‚Äôll be like a beta for it idk tho
---
Every BR has a ‚Äústorm‚Äù closing in that forces all the players to the same spot in the map, so you can only hide so long. :) they mentioned this would be the case for fallout.
---
Fixing the perks is a superficial change.  They haven't done that.  
---
Fixing the look drops is a superficial change, still waiting.
---
The game was advertised as a big open world and PVE, as in a traditional fallout game but you can play with your friends and team up together.
---
Survival mode and now BR mode are modes that are clearly different from what I paid full price for on a game that is still utterly flawed.
---
Thanks man, finding a balance between being sounding like a shill and being overly critical is hard, especially because I'm a rabid fan that also is pissed as hell it takes so long to get things fixed!  
---
   
---
Yes, at the time we talk they had a few hundred fixes in queue, the problem they have is the same any major company has, a loss of mobility due to "established processes and workflow".  
---
I'm under the impression they are working hard to find a way to be more agile.  
---
For the 8 of us, we have a slightly shorter path to get attention to issues, no direct paths, but a way to make sure what we report isn't lost in the white noise of 1,000 other reports that day.
---
Well hellfire armor has been on my wish list for a long while, now here's to hoping the heavy incinerator is brought back cause that was my all time favorite gun in fo3 and a legendary version would just make me wetter.
---
i will, thank you! downloads take forever when you keep switching back to see what you're at. like watching water boil.
---
# Dumbass, this is the title!
---
# CELEBRATE BE3 2019 WITH THE E3 ATOM BONUS BUNDLE
---
The bombs drop in a week, hope you fare well dude!
---
Pubg is what 100 ppl... Down to 50 in less then 90seconds and down to 25 in 10 mins.
---
I dont think anything has to change. As far as I'm aware nothing ingame specifically says "every single soul" is confirmed dead. So they would play the current quests as normal, everyone in those questlines would be dead and they would learn why.
---
How are they using BR to get monet when the update is fucking FREE. no one is going to buy 76 for the BR and the first week is also FREE. you comment makes no sense at all
---
I was okay with the game having no Human NPCs but Bethesda just had to make the game more awesome.
---
Yeah but I'd rather not have high hopes going in. If the overseer position comes with some actual power though, I'd definitely get into it.
---
Yup got my camp by overseers will make sure I have plenty of crops and purifiers ready for this week and the coming weeks hopefully see some more new faces. I believe we are the best community right now :)
---
I may know a guy who knows a guy if you got the caps...
---
Oh shut up.
---
It‚Äôs development time that could have been used to address the issues that have been present since launch,  instead they‚Äôre shoehorning in another mode to try to appeal to the PUBG style game crowd.
---
It‚Äôs pandering and it‚Äôs bullshit.
---
Looks like I‚Äôm finally getting the game. Good job devs. Maybe start with this next time
---
Thank you! People acting like I'm the crazy one out here.
---
WHAT. game changing. Thank you.
---
Translation: Fo76 will be the test bed for our new ideas / future development. To compensate for buggy, half baked mechanics, it will be f2p. Thanks in advance for the downvotes.
---
Yeah, People should think the same thing about every '''bad''' game that exists. Its completely optional for you to buy or get, so you should ignore it if you don't like it .
---
Why ignore it other than to be a contrarian dick about it?
---
There were PLENTY of reasons to ignore survival, from the lack of any real reward compared to just playing Adventure to the increased chances of actually losing your caps and aid items in the process.
---
But none of that shit applies to nuclear winter, hell it's likely going to be the most balanced pvp experience this game is ever going to see and at the very least will provide a nice distraction when you have nothing better to do.
---
I really like the thought of NPCs being involved in the game. Can definitely feel a bit flat and dead at times only having the robots to chat to.
---
Micro transactions. If you think this is meant to be for the players and not to get more payers I fear for your naive soul
---
They‚Äôre much better nowadays. Gotta give them credit because they have improved in a lot of areas.
---
It is.
---
If you're curious about the game still, there is a free week starting tomorrow. Would give you a chance to test the game and decide for yourself instead of reading secondhand opinions about it. Althiugh the update coming in Fall really seems enticing to me, and we wont get to try it this free week unfortunately.
---
Thank you for sharing, and willing to do so much to make the game better. I hope it did go beyond just that one meeting and there was continuing dialogue. The reveal today looks very promising and interesting and seems to address a lot of the issues with the game feeling "dead".
---
Being in the corporate world, this story blows my mind. Can you imagine EA doing this? I hope someone else comes forward or at least Bethesda confirms it actually happened. Not trying to call you a liar or anything but hey I'm some anonymous Internet asshole reading a post from some other anonymous Internet asshole :). Honestly it would be a good look from them to say " hey, we heard, we're sorry, we're trying." 
---
Though I wonder if some higher ups threatened to shut the whole studio down if they didn't fix it and they were frantic for help and willing to do something like this.
---
Let‚Äôs embrace the new faces that come! Hopefully they‚Äôll stick around.
---
Zenimax Online did not develop Fallout 76...
---
I said "for me and for most of us"
---
What part of these numbers aren't you capable to understand?
---
I wonder if you will be able to nuke the NPC settlements?  Or will they have new protection zones?
---
Thanks everyone for your feedback :)
---
How you're not banned from this subreddit already is beyond me. The metrics the mods have for banning makes no sense, you're an out and out homophobe  for christ's sake
---
I know the numbers and I am 100% pve personally except for when I have to jump over to survival for the weekly challenge gun. I don‚Äôt understand why it‚Äôs wrong to be optimistic about them trying something new. I might not want to play it. But it‚Äôs not bad that they are trying to expand the player base.
---
Suddenly the 76 is a VR program we are stuck in feels more likely.
---
We will learn all that when we play it
---
I might.....what bundle is it, I havent heard about any atom shop updates
---
You watched them own up to their mistakes and you dismiss it as a plea for forgiveness? The free, optional, BR mode is a cash grab? The new PVE content is kinda groundbreaking. We're getting a continuing storyline (possibly annual?) rather than being stuck in a stagnated world where nothing changes like all prior FO games.   
---
You just kinda sound like someone who likes bitching.
---
Did you get the BOS sniper rifle plan for free yet?
---
Well, I'm getting annoyed because I am being repeatedly told that I am wrong, when the title is showing exactly what I posted and nothing is explained in the article itself that it starts tomorrow...
---
Exactly!
---
It already does. The Brahmin you encounter in free range are safe until the mission completes. Chally is also safe, but not the Responder Vendor's brahmin. NPCs are safe...
---
I think we'll see more videos of people crying about ES6 not being shown.
---
Don't be like that. People once said that about Fallout 76.
---
The folk I know who rag on F076 get it from youtube streamers ::shrug::
---
When you played it did it have a full 50+ players? Because I doubt the servers would be able to handle that many players at the same time as the servers already struggle with 24 players. So more than double than that I have a feeling the lag will be seriously bad.
---
I'm really excited for Cyberpunk.
---
On the Bethesda site it said that companions will be added with wastelanders. There will most certainly be a dog.
---
Maybe you should care enough about it to read up on it even the slightest, because whining that a game mode you join the same way as Adventure and Survival is going to be a server wide event that forces you to drop what you're doing and fight the 52 people that were suddenly dumped on your server is pretty fucking stupid.
---
Scrap your stuff and immediately stash it.
---
Bumper Swords please üó° ‚öîÔ∏è
---
Troll account pretending to be a paid shill.
---
I figured I wouldn't do that, been with Fallout since 3, but thanks for the tip anyways. :)
---
hey, at least there‚Äôs no radspiders yet. right? *......right???*
---
No one is forcing you to play :D
---
Yeah, I really didn't like how the game was just like "you're part of all of the factions now" yeah that's cool but why can't we have more fleshed out factions with other players to fight with and against?
---
That's it in a nutshell and what my first phone call with them was about.   
---
A way to set those with actually helpful feedback and bug reports apart from the white noise. 
---
It's not about elitism (it's come up before), it's about streamlining.  
---
'76 has its faults, more than a few, but the core is so much fun, and has so much potential I'm here to stay.
---
they always have excellent presentations..
---
their execution has sometimes been lacking.. we will soon see how they do this time...
---
keep your fingers crossed
---
No shit, that's the point of trailers.
---
Then their bad :\\ 
---
I didn't know about those issues since FO76 looked like ass to me. But credits to them, because with the introduction of NPCs, dialogue trees and this free BR mode, it piqued my interest enough to consider buying it later this year.
---
At the end of the crackpipe because there was actually no Anti Material Rifle unfortunately.  
---
People who are less "gun savy" probably confused the modified long combat rifles shown in the trailer (specially with the muzzle break) with the Anti Material Rifle i bet
---
There is a person, maybe a small group, that for whatever reason absolutely hate the game, and run a squad of downvote bots here. For reasons.
---
Every post gets a slew of them at first, and sadly it means some fall off out of new and never make it to those who view by default.
---
Adventure is pve, survival is pvp, nuclear winter is battle royale. 
---
In adventure there is very few ways to be griefed BUT it is still possible. 
---
Your inventory is limited. You don't need resources that bad so be discretionary BUT to learn mods about weapons and armor you need to scrap those particular weapons and armor. Collect those. 
---
Everything can be broken down at work benches (except legendaries) and they are all around. Broken down items take up less weight in your inventory. All benches access your stash, you do not need resources on you at the time to craft or cook. 
---
At train stations and red rockets are stash boxes that link to your stash. Stash all ypur junk regularly
---
More like I think they'll reduce it happening even more by adding NPC's and possibly removing PvP from adventure mode altogether. 
---
I hope they do fix survival mode for all those that like that!
---
That's understandable. But when its showing different people different things, and you call someone a dumbass because of it, It just makes you seem like a selfish jackass
---
F
---
Sweet! I didn‚Äôt see that
---
Anyone who is upset about fo76 e3 presentation ;
---
I encourage you to look at the current state of anthem and how their e3 went. If you care about this game and community, you‚Äôd be a fool to not see the love and funding that Bethesda is pouring into this game.
---
Anthem fans (or any other fans of ((insert said game or gaming studio here)), Would be so thankful for the care and attention that we just received as fans and fallout players from that E3 presentation. 
---
But as per the usual, people will complain to no end, but as for myself, I am excited and thankful.
---
Keep it up Bethesda, I am proud of you. Looking forward to the future
---
The main quest serves as a sort of tour of the area and points you to the good spots(enclave and BoS). You definitely want to join the enclave as it is the route to unlock current endgame.
---
No it doesn‚Äôt. The lucky hole thing looked much less human
---
Most exciting thing?

---
Hmm, the time zone is a killer. I usually play some  between 9 and 1am seldom during the daytime. 
---
What kind of things are you looking for most in a new camp? What‚Äôs your level? Does that factor into location?
---
Change their... so you think they'll wait a week or two and announce "Hey folks, some people aren't digging this game mode we spent all our time on so we're just gonna junk it!  Thanks for playing!"
---
Yay! Another slow re-spec to adjust for another update!
---
Just give us the ability to respec at will already!
---
I think most players would build nicer houses if the restrictions weren't so tight, I've read alot of posts of players not even being able to place their floating 1 foundation houses.

---
We already have snallygasters, which we know are just regionally-named centaurs
---
Same boat, NONE of us thrilled when they told us the BR mode was next up to preview..  
---
That said, even the most opposed enjoyed it quite a bit.  
---
No clue how close to the alpha we played it will be, and I hope they included some of our feedback, but it was fun
---
DorkJedi is my handle. if you see me on tomorrow evening, gimme a holler.
---
I don't think you realize the type of people the BR will bring in. With the lack of antihack software on the servers, this will fill the game with even more hackers.
---
Not to mention how do they expect the servers to handle 52 players when the servers struggle now with 24 players.
---
I can hardly wait! :D
---
I havent played since a month or probably less after release. I'll definitely be coming back soon. I'm pretty neutral on the battle royal thing but i'll try it. The Wastelander update is what i'm especially excited for
---
When is it coming out?
---
Easy explanation. Nuclear Winter is entirely non-canon. Think about it. How on earth can we have multiple overseers for the same vault that kill each other over and over in a nuclear hellscape every few hours? I think that NW is just cool but not really taking place in lore.
---
Which are both intended mechanics for pvp, not griefing. 
---
Hard to grief someone who's happy you took their bounty off for them.
---
Hard to get a bounty these days too- if you even happen to find someone who doesnt have pacifist on- they're probably pretty happy to fight you.
---
The free week is coming with the update. At least from what I unsterstand.
---
That was what I immediately thought with that ring of fire but even more after reading how it works. It is 100% Hunger Games. Specifically the second movie/book
---
Hmm, guess I was wrong. I had Plague walker but when I ran up to a cat to go pretend to pet it, as normal ppl do, I started hurting it. A black mark on my "no cats ever injured" record.
---
I saw that! Hopefully it will be better than the crossbow!
---
Again I can't say how close the launched NW will be to the alpha we played, but it was fun, and most importantly it's an option, another, different way to play the same game!
---
Makes sense and sounds good to me! Both sides of the player base would be happy.
---
It is completely different from Adventure mode CAMP based on the article they put up on Bethesda.net. Your Adventure CAMP will be blueprinted and can still be placed in Nuclear Winter, but doing so will not affect how it is in Adventure mode, so you will be able to go back and forth.
---
I assume either tomorrow or Tuesday.
---
Cool. Solid effort man!
---
Damn, thanks for the warning. I am kinda at a roadblock though. I have to get the radio working for the chick at the top of the world, but I get completely sqrewed over the moment I walk near that area. Am I supposed to be a higher level or am I just that unlucky?
---
Woah Skyrkm Together supports 20+ people, player vending, a map larger than skyrim, and building anywhere on the map now all without stealing code?  I mean, the guy said modders could do what Bethesda is planning for this year in two months, so I assume they've managed to at least make 76 given all the time since Skyrim has been modable.
---
Once you meet Rose the main quest gets alot harder. Especially since she's in an area popular with high level players.
---
Lmao maybw they could fix and polish the main game and servers before they do more shit
---
I‚Äôm there now, the canyon is a little wide but it is there. There is a creek between Grafton town and Grafton dam. It is North of the prison. 
---
The canyon is closer to the dam and the creek lets out into the lake between the pioneer camp and the dam.
---
The game they will be releasing at the end of the year, is the game they made us pay to beta test.
---
You dont bring your camp into NW. Only blueprints. And you can build and save blueprints in Workshops. No need to dismantle your camp friend
---
It's a cool statue. You come up to it, and it has an activate prompt. Push whatever your system calls for and it disappears, in a swarm of moths. Then they all return to form the statue proper.
---
Yep!
---
Only hunt players who's bounty outweigh what I would loose for dying!
---
Might just cop it because of Keanu. üòÑ
---
Thanks, already been doing that since Fallout 4.
---
What do you mean by not needing resources the craft things or cook?
---
Yeah, I agree, and it makes 1 sandwich.  I'll never make it again now that I completed it for the cooking badge.
---
I've been waiting for something to lure me back to 76. NPCs returning as if the world is genuinely evolving as a live service was the dream we all hoped for. 
---
I think Bethesda needs to give BioWare a shout out for lowering the standards with Anthem and attracting the circle jerk so that 76 gets some room to breathe and actually come together with ongoing support.
---
Thank you for sharing with us know that you're able to.  I'm glad that you ride them as you put and help make sure they fix the problems that we find.  I'm also glad that they are looking into ways to be more agile about bugs and communicating with us.  Keep up the good work.
---
Yea there was one with lights all over it too. So i think your right, looks like a skin. Either way it‚Äôs going to be interesting to check out!
---
Eh.  "Should have had from the beginning" wouldn't have made sense and also wouldn't have made the eventual return of civilization as impactful.  The other two are just bad troll memes.
---
The top of the world girl, right? Yeah I noticed cause I can barely walk two feet before getting killed my something that's level 30.
---
They are? Since when? I've seen at least 3 server wide crashes in the last week that I am 100% sure were server wide. Many more if I include the ones I suspect were server wide, but didn't have other friends on the same server at the time to double check.
---
Start in the "old" world and when you reach a certain point you can choose to move forward into the new one
---
They probably ran out of stash space?
---
I'm one of the haters, I was pretty gleefully watching the game burn.
---
All I and a lot of the critics wanted was a proper Fallout game I could play with my friends.
---
We'll see how this turns out but if it makes up the distance then this is probably what will convert me. I'm not going to get my hopes up, but I'm optimistic.
---
Do you know if there's anything to take from that, plans/recipes/etc, that you can use in Adventure but only get it BR?
---
Figured I'd help the settlers, but if theres companions involved Ima have to sus them all out!
---
they are needed for Brain Bombs recipe
---
My brain hurts. üß†
---
What kind of bundle is coming tomorrow ?
---
Some like cash/swap, otherwise you pay the vendor tax and no one likes paying tax on the more expensive items. Everyone likes a bargain and you can both win if you split the tax.
---
If you see something in a vendor machine, and your charisma is high enough, try asking for a reasonably discount, you never know. Shooting and being a dick will only get you fertiliser and toilet paper in a bag.
---
Non legendary weapons are easy to find. You'll run into another one. This weapon so early is wasted stash space.
---
Well Storm, I‚Äôm once again blown away by your devotion to this franchise. Good on you for being so hellbound on doing your part to help 76 be the masterpiece we all know it can be. It‚Äôs great to know that YOU like Nuclear Winter because I honestly value your opinion when it comes to 76. 
---
Anyway, I hope you enjoy the rest of E3. Thanks for sharing, and have fun!
---
Good to see I‚Äôm not alone :)
---
You haven't been paying attention to how it's being used these days then
---
Im really not looking forward to battle royal and dislike the idea that will be somenof the only way to gst specific items for those who dont want or dislike pvp.
---
You are making up a conspiracy that isn't true. I post here quite often and I don't get downvotes as soon as I post something.
---
Anthem players on suicide watch
---
I just hope it‚Äôs added to the radio soon even if it‚Äôs not the Johnny Cash version.
---
Do you know if i'll be able to level up/earn caps in BR to use in the open world/PvE later on?
---
From what I inferred from that trailer, I think you'll get to choose what side you are on. Calling it now, this will be the beginning of the raiders.
---
Grab them all and make omelettes out of them. You can make a decent amount of caps selling them to vendors.
---
Agree. PVP sucks.
---
If someone is negative about everything, they‚Äôre going to be right sometimes.
---
there's already special weapons you can only get playing survival though...
---
This might be the year of Bethesda fixing their mistakes. This is goooood
---
I actually like the game. Been playing since beta. But I think we should be honest with each other. We are testers in a Software as a Service model.
---
Its cause he is right outside vault 51.
---
I have a whole armful of baseball bats, outfits and canned meat stew to hand out!!! I am excited~
---
I‚Äôm going to just wait patiently until it‚Äôs actually out and see what happens.  That‚Äôs how you find out about things.
---
I‚Äôm American... Is that some other region‚Äôs version of GameStop?
---
Totally stoked about this, now let's get permanent skills back and we'll be good.
---
With this being said, what location has the highest amount Legendary enemies?
---
I want to not waste time on locations that aren't worth it.
---
You can try server hopping. Enemy levels are based on the highest level player in the area when they spawn, so if a high level has come through before you you're SoL.
---
Fucking love The Onion.
---
I would like to know how much improved it is since release? I had it preordered but refunded it and I am kinda keen to get involved for the week.
---
High levels are 9 time out of 10 always looking out for the lower levels :) obviously there will be that small minority that aren‚Äôt as nice but 76 generally has a good player base.
---
That's beside the point. I'm not complaining because of the prize, in fact I'm not complaining at all. All I'm saying is, since I own the product, I have the right to be happy or not about it.
---
This week, you meant last week right. Had like 50 blu-screen still counting.
---
Hahah good point.
---
Yes but Bethesda didn't move 80% of the staff from 76
---
Yeah, you may want to either grind it out in the forest/Toxic Valley/ash heap, as seen [here](https://www.falloutbuilds.com/t/fallout-76-zone-map-with-recommended-level-range/), or just keep an eye on the map to make sure no high lvl‚Äôs are in that area
---
They're just normal legendaries with guaranteed effects. I can get one (or a better one) by just playing the game. I can't get hellfire armor by just playing the game
---
See: Anthem. 
---
Honestly the launch of Fallout 76 looks like a fucking Michaelangelo painting compared to the shitstorm Anthem has been
---
Getting a preview of nuclear winter tomorrow along with the free play week
---
Oooh. Completely missed that. Sucks bro. F
---
Thank you for sharing your adventure with us.  It's nice to hear that work is being actively done and concerns are being listened to, even they can't fix things as fast as we'd like.  I'm glad they're still invested in the game and making it the best it can be.  I've had to stop for now because those little things just got too frustrating, but hopefully they'll get them fixed before the next big things drop, because I am definitely interested in some of the stuff coming down the pipe.
---
Or sneak. As far as I'm aware you dont have to actually fight anything in that part of the quest. Try just sneaking or rushing past the enemies and focus on the objective
---
It's a toss up lol you dont carry over perksor gear from adventure, your SPECIAL stats do nothing, and you can't VATS other players~
---
*soul
---
Agreed.  I remember that happening to me when I was lvl1.  Honestly it freaked me out since I didn't understand or even know that gifting was a thing. I really thought that I  had some sort of stalker in my camp... "Why does this massive PA guy keep squating up and down and shooting at my feet??"  I was literally a little scared, so I just ignored him and hoped he'd leave.  But after 10 minutes of this I finally had my ahh-haa moment when I found the brown bag he was trying to give me.  I give my high level guy/ girl huge  credit for being so patient.
---
I sat through E3 today just to see 76 and im stoked,could care less what other people think.I installed launch day and went in blind,its been one of my favorite releases in a long while.
---
Do you have a link for that image? I m genuinely curious
---
I get thw argument I will get, don't like it don't play it. That also would mean id lose out on a portion of the yame story or items and thats not right
---
Great! Now I have to start playing again.
---
Lots of interesting stuff from the trailer. Seems like the crashed space station is turning into a town or a raider base or something.
---
That is adorable *lol*
---
I'm so glad they brought out the Gift emote haha
---
I assume it's coming tomorrow, since they said the free week that starts tomorrow lets you try out nuclear winter. It would be really weird saying that and then making people wait a day before they can try it...the free week should have started on Tuesday if that's when the update would have been
---
They are mostly just nutritious, nothing else
---
You can use any blueprint pre-made in adventure mode or you can build freehand in nuclear winter, neither effects your adventure mode camp though
---
Doesnt mean its cheating or something lol, sentinel plus perks can do that
---
I, for one, am ready to kill it with fire.  And bullets.  Mostly bullets.
---
Agreed. I have mixed feelings about the E3 info, because it follows the same old pattern: Bethesda including something new that should have already been in the game since launch. Sure NPC's sounds interesting. But it does seem to be a pretty basic "settlers vs. raiders" type story line.   Basically you can side with the minute men or the Raiders. I was hoping to eventually see a resurgent Brotherhood of Steel.
---
game is way to janky for serious competitive pvp...
---
Literally what I do all the time. Someone will find use for it!
---
Your point is immaterial since its anecdotal AND wrong
---
Mothman‚Äôs Secret, the new lingerie store
---
Treat them with kindness, let's get some more players to join us.
---
COMPANIONS!!!
---
So is this skin or set something that we will have to win? I am not the greatest at PVP and I LOVE the look of that new suit. If I have to win a round of the battle royale, I‚Äôll be a bit upset.
---
Hunting season starts tomorrow. No need for being sporting...*loads TSE Minigun*...
---
Ash heeap? Where?
---
&gt; for just one example, the lack of updates on the promised mod support and dedicated servers.
---
They said that wouldn't be a thing until November 2019 or later so of course they haven't talked about that yet since it's not in their near/immediate future plans.
---
The point of the main game was to make it inhabitable for humans.
---
Let the young ones huff and puff and tantrum over BR ‚Äúruining‚Äù the game more so than our actual children do when we deny them candy. Can you believe these cry babies?
---
I'm sorry I've had 99% positive experiences and you haven't. Thanks for your opinion.
---
Wanting to be able to build better homes doesn't mean one should only have to play Minecraft. If a game is going to have a base building option, they need to make it less buggy and restrictive.
---
I miss this game. I haven‚Äôt got to play it since I had to get rid of my PS4.
---
The fact that Bethesda keeps releasing shit unfinished, and I'm just supposed to accept them fixing it close to a year after release. They don't really deserve another chance imo.
---
lol you know what's miserable ? Buying and playing Fallout 76.
---
But I've heard that just the day one patch was 50 gb.
---
I love you u/hug-bot
---
Yea, but I clearly gave you a idea on what I was seeing on my end. All I kept getting from you was basically, did you not read the article.
---
Gee it's almost like the setting made sense to not have NPCs initially.
---
Trust me, I agree with you completely
---
It will get me to give it a try special cause wild life is there too
---
&gt; to expand the player base.
---
That is the problem.
---
This ob$e$$ion for PvP/BR of the company is not EXPANDING the player base, it's dividing it and shrinking it.
---
Imagine Lakers fans that go every match day to watch a basketball match. One day, surprisingly, there is not a basket game, and they are running a tennis game. 
---
Sure some will stay "tennis is cool too", but +90% of the auduence will pass. 
---
Not that basket is better than tennis (or vice).
---
Me (and apparently most of us) came here to play a Fallout game, with quests, crafting, PVE... and cooperative stuff added: building, commerce, co-op...
---
If I wanted to play PvP or BR I would play any of the real top PVP or BR games instead.
---
Are we getting Preston Garvey back too?
---
And the bow and arrow at the beginning of the trailer!
---
I know. That's why I like 76 so much, but the trailer for npc's looks really fucking bad ass but it'll probably be a shit show
---
Can confirm, been getting grief over liking it since the Beta. Only finally have been getting some slack after winning a bet that the game would feature human NPCs making a return in Wastelanders. Even then they are skeptical (which is fair), but I'll take every victory I can get.
---
Imagine blindly believing Mr. "Fallout 3 will have 200 endings" Todd Howard
---
I saw the E3 conference and after seeing what is coming to 76, I'm thinking of picking it up tbh, for $30 can't go wrong. I remember at launch and for a while the game wasn't in a good state but seeing the E3 coverage, looks like Bethesda is moving in the right direction. Can I join you all in the wasteland?
---
Yeah I‚Äôm gonna try it too it seemed pretty interesting
---
I'm more interested in the crashed space thingy in the background.
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
Play through the quests , do the events but most importantly have fun. There is a lot to take in especially as you start looking into what builds you‚Äôd like to do etc üëçüèº
---
There a "Tales From The West Virginia Hills" Holo tape I think you need to listen to...just don't take it from my hand, let me set it down first.
---
*sets down paper bag and steps back a few feet*
---
There you go
---
Which update are you talking about? Free week starts tommorow, which update comes out tommorow?
---
I‚Äôll even server hop multiple times and get the same error. Really weird.
---
Thats why i wanna post the vid...
---
Then why make it available on PS4? It‚Äôs not my fault the product isn‚Äôt optimized, shut up.
---
All of which have NOTHING to do with BR
---
No witch hunting. If you don't want your post removed, remove the name. Rule 4.
---
I beg to differ, but I'm partial to r/rwby Pennybot.
---
Heavy combat has the highest overall defence
---
That seems like a fun thing to add to Grahms inventory
---
Just submit a nice ticket and I am sure they will fix it for you since this was clearly just a miscommunication.
---
Is the bundle out yet? Cause I still don't see it...it is still +100 atoms but not + 500 atoms
---
Ya, no. You quoted most of the article, I mentioned and quoted the article title, and you precede to DUMBASS YOU WRONG rather than simply say that it says otherwise or question what I mean. I'm over it. Regard you didnt read the date, so I dont feel bad you missed out anymore.
---
Oh, so you‚Äôre from LA. That explains it. Do you it get that it‚Äôs an OPTIONAL side mode they are adding? We all want a full on fo5 but in the meantime we have this. Or nothing. And more waiting. Jeez dude. Relax. If it‚Äôs so frustrating to you then stop playing 76 and commenting. You‚Äôre enraged points are falling on deaf ears. Have a good night if you‚Äôre capable.
---
Didn‚Äôt look too bad tbh, like I was annoyed at first with the idea of it a few weeks ago.
---
Well, personally I haven't had any trouble I guess.
---
I'm playing on PC if that matters?
---
"An in depth knowledge of electronics" ? Wtf?
---
Late in the year last i heard.
---
Hoping it will stand pure amount battle royals modes 
---
But Human NPCs
---
All that matters is if the pip boy date is updated to be in sync with when the game first launched....
---
No, you don‚Äôt know that.  Every weapon fits the build because that‚Äôs how you increase the damage of non bloodied weapons.  And I‚Äôve already told you that sentinel armor is garbage for pvp.  The Sentinel effect DOES NOT work when you are crouched and you should always be crouched in PVP so you can‚Äôt be VATS‚Äôd!   If you are standing you are DEAD.   End of story.  This is not news dude.  I‚Äôm trying to help you understand and you‚Äôd rather remain ignorant than try to understand.  Are you on Xbox?
---
Is this crusade on xbox? I wanna get some nice kills
---
yes accurate
---
game executes exceptional with all applications do not hesitate
---
today bethesda 76 is top upon games across the world! purchase now with great success with victory and success always
---
Pretty fuckin rad i agree
---
So am I, maybe you play at less peak hours?
---
Sorry, first arrivals, I screwed the format up
---
Why are you here?
---
Watoga vendor has meat sometimes
---
Yeah I agree. I think they went down the "look! New fallout!" route too much when they'd probably have better better off marketing it as "let's see what online shit works with fallout".
---
Citizen Cane Frog Legs?
---
How would we know?
---
I think the whole game is free to play til the 17th
---
Why are you on its subreddit?
---
Coule be thicker, but hot, nonetheless.
---
Your entire existence is just you shitting on things  that people like lol but whatever helps you sleep at night
---
I think the meta is go for 2* and have more chances.. unless one of those third attributes is crucial to you
---
Already farming mats to give away hundreds of stimpacks
---
Yea man. I just bought the game and Im hype for it. Battle royal can be fun. Look at red dead online. Gun rush teams is the best game mode.
---
Not what I meant
---
IDGAF if people trash talk it. if I enjoy, I play. period. no discussion.
---
Following. 
---
Im confused on their wording also. They make it seem like it's a week preview of nuclear winter, but there are no proper release dates of nuclear winter. And if it's ready to release, why put it for free for a week, getting new people interested, but then taking it away meaning people might not buy the game because they loose interest before the mode drops for real.
---
Platform?
---
People hate battle royal because its a sign of unoriginality and greed. This one looks pretty good, but I can understand the hate for games such as realm royale for example.
---
Skyrim stealth archer intensifies
---
Hello satan
---
Take my money. I‚Äôm in
---
It is sad. Sometimes the players can be such an udder disappointment.
---
"I am salty that this game is improving"
---
I sleep well thinking about the fact i didn't gave my money to a company that wanted to screw me.
---
Hmm, if you find any answers let me know
---
On top of that with the lag problems on xbox how am I reliably gonna pvp in battle royal.
---
You clearly got told you were wrong from me and two other people... Also the bolded word of "now" shouldn't have been so easily missed on your part. I won't be missed out because someone did in this article what you failed to do, which was point to the support page of where I needed to go and submit a ticket. Instead of trying to be that guy that goes in people's post and try tell them they are wrong, you should do what the purpose of this forum is for. Which is simply help them with a solution.
---
Those aren't coming any time soon. It said at the earliest fall 2019, yet we are still waiting on lots of stuff they promised a long time ago, such as display cases, and placing junk as decoration in your CAMP.
---
Are you able to talk about why you liked this battle royale mode? It looks unique, but from your comments in this thread you made it sound like there‚Äôs something different or at least something that makes it work better than other BR
---
The old Wastelanders dlc poster showed vaultboy and girl exiting a vault with gold falling out of a bag. That must be the "fortune"?
---
I get it if people don't like the concept of it but at the end of the day it's free DLC, and if it bothers them so much, they just don't need to play it.
---
Plays Division LOL.
---
Yeah I never had faith that would be a good game.  To be fair I can't remember the last time any multiplayer game was a good game.
---
this day on top of all days friend we have accomplished success
---
all buy game fallout 76 now for fun and become win!
---
Wow the r/games thread is pure garbage
---
Free does not always equal good. 
---
I tried to play again and the game crashed on my first try, and on the next launch it was incredibly laggy. Weird how it's the only game I own that does that.
---
But I'm supposed to be happy that my 6 month old game is finally getting NPC's
---
Exactly. As long as its free, I can't see a point in complaining about it.
---
Probably best to get it online
---
Divorce rate goes up due to Fo76 year2
---
I think it‚Äôs just one year, I believe they are going for a real-time game meant to mirror the reality of the game in a really meta way that I think personally is cool as hell. 
---
Year 1: FO76 and the world within are both experiencing the first plunge into a dangerous new world (one literally one metaphorically into the new world of an online Fallout RPG), some people don‚Äôt ‚Äúsurvive‚Äù (quit), and some thrive with experience and time in the wasteland.
---
Year 2: People have grown comfortable, made their homes, set up their pitiful shacks, but the world was also growing around them. I think Bethesda is hoping that this massive new content will bring a new breath of life to the game, much like the nova will. 
---
And with the inclusion of both this dlc and the global phenomena that is Battle Royales, they are probably right.
---
I think it is VERY meta, 
---
well
---
either that or I‚Äôm really high
---
I think the 3rd has a few vats related ones or direct special buffs.
---
So if your a vats sniper or gunslinger...maybe.
---
Heavy weapons tho prob 2* 
---
Thats what i did anyway. Also i only had 3 rolls if i went for 3* so i took my chances on another chance. Paid off 2 great rolls 2 weird rolls.
---
Gamblers amrite?
---
I've no need or interest for it. But I have fun doing what I do , I'm sure others may enjoy it. Anyone have a robot dense mod , I been searching for weeks , cant find it at any vendors , player or robot.
---
Anthem didn't come up in the EA conference lol. No once that I recall. IMO, Fallout 76 should be happy that they at least got some stage time at E3 instead of getting the Andromeda treatment that EA gives to less than successful games.
---
So true it hurts. I'm one of those schmucks who is still hanging on to a sliver of hope that Bioware might No Man's Sky the shit out of Anthem. But it looks more and more bleak with every update. Such a shame. The IP had absolutely insane potential, and to fumble it like that is just criminal.
---
You really think the servers will be able to handle 52 players? Look at how they handle 24 players now. Half the time they can't even handle that, so they will not be able to handle more than double that many players.
---
I fast traveled between fissure sites spawning them one at a time in order to get the meat for badges. alas... every one did not give the right meat for every kill. it was a ridiculous reminder of why I live on dog food and don't bother with stat food at all.
---
I was like hell yeah! Then I saw this [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOClc6Svg4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOClc6Svg4)
---
Geez whoever put that one together needs to do the 76 trailer.. One was drinking soy and the other was eating onions
---
Nvm from what I read online nuclear winter starts in the fall but this week is basically a beta to try it out til the 17th
---
If 2 will do, then choose that. It's the perfect 3rd that might be your Moby Dick. 
---
Still, it would've been nice to have the Mystery Pick that was on the original postings, 65 scrip for a 3* lucky dip. Was not on the choice when purveyor came live.
---
Or you will call elitist police?
---
Launch a nuke. It's the last quest of the story.  Nuke launches can be repeated
---
More customers for my moderately overpriced goods.
---
What qualifies this as a hard truth? Is a soft truth a kind of a lie?
---
Emminent Domain!!!
---
They've always been available for workshops, just not camps.
---
Mine doez this too. I just go into sneak and peruse the map or my pipboy. Lol. Works fine after that.
---
eBay
---
&gt;Thanks for your diligence with the bug reports. My main question is why haven't they fixed so many of the easy ones?
---
Probably because they're not easy. When systems (in this case the program) very big enough, you start running into unexpected consequences trying to fix something because of so many interconnected links. 
---
Example: melee VATS doesn't work in flying creatures. Seems like an easy fix, but what if they tried to fix it and didn't properly dial in the proximity? Suddenly you have people teleporting through the air to VATS strike a bug, they fly too high, and suffer damage on impact. You've just created a whole new problem. 
---
Modders make it look easy because they can just test it on their own machine, release it, and if it breaks on your system "oh well, it was a free mod. Disable it until it's fixed." BGS can't do that. Anything they release has to work on xbox, ps4, and thousands of different PC configs.
---
My comment is a general view (not directed at you) that it does not hurt to ask, and buyers get nowhere annoying player vendors.
---
I'd love for them to do a similar charity campaign to the County Roads release.  You get the song &amp; throw some money at a charity while you're at it.    Bethesda, please get on it!
---
Fo76 community: we want humans! Once we get humans: I hate this
---
brah BRAH why do you think BRs are free
---
You say crouching doesn't activate sentinel, but guess what the 2 I couldn't kill were doing? So I'll say again I trust what I've seen. If you can't prove it, I can't change my opinion.
---
I don't know, it's just how I worded it.
---
Done then. Im just sending the video to bethesda
---
Your on a console? I am on pc and that place gives me weird fps around the reactor. Idk why.
---
I wonder how they'll do unique companions. All I can imagine is every person having the same Bob Raider companion following them around, so I'm interested to see what they do to avoid this.
---
Raider armor and Plans for raider armor for the human npc vendors? Or atleast put them in the raider bot vendors. Also a new mutant enemy and a Plasma caster shown in the trailer.
---
Pc
---
That guy is the Ted Bundy of the fallout community.
---
Change my mind!
---
Haven't had this issue for weeks. But yeah better late than never.
---
Them dick enlargement pills are doin work
---
Keep on trucking!!!
---
eh, battle royals are a dime a dozen. A joke these days, sorta sad to see thats the route they went and Im even less excited to see how badly 52 person battle royal runs on this highly unoptimized engine.
---
The only saving grace from what they showed was the wastelanders expansion
---
Never advocated for humans. I DO NOT speak for the community in anyway.
---
I go for 2*. Every 3* I have gotten has been trash, bit the 2*s seem to be pretty good. Also as said previously you get more chances with 2*s. 3* armor might be worth it, since weapon weight is pretty useful, but it's still a pretty big gamble for not alot of reward
---
I asked for it?
---
No mans sky is already a great game now. It just keeps getting better. 
---
76 is catching up if all holds well
---
i been dreading this day.   my CAMP is nestled just north of that area.    i think i need to look for a new place to move to by tomorrow afternoon lol.
---
* Setting begins as an apocalyptic wasteland where you've emerged from a vault after hell broke loose.  Everyone is dead.  
---
"wHy ArE tHeRe No HuMaN nPcS"
---
* You explore the ruins and figure out not only what happened, but why it happened.
---
"bUt It'S nOt FaLlOuT wItHoUt HuMaN nPcS"
---
*You're given tools and explanations on how to fix this so that the land stops being inhospitable.
---
"dEaD gAmE nO nPcS"
---
*NPCs now come into the world after spending months of clearing out the shit that would make restructuring/repopulation attempts impossible.
---
"lOl LiViNg StOrY yEaH rIgHt"
---
To piggyback on this, have there been any news on the "legendary players" new post-lvl 50 progression thingy they mentioned?
---
No, I don't like battle royale games because all you do is wait. You wait to find a match, you wait to fight enemies. You get shot by someone you didn't even see, then repeat the process all over.
---
That being said, there's always exceptions to the rule. I liked the BR mode in Rec Room more than the other games. Maybe I'll absolutely love the one in F76.
---
&gt; Oh, so you‚Äôre from LA. 
---
hmmm, almost‚Ä¶ I am from Europe! I just use to show examples here that Americans are familiar with. ;)
---
Anyway, it's all good. I am sure, that like Fallout fans we agree in most of the other things about the game. Nite.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/byrpmx/wastelanders_offical_art/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app
---
&gt;Yes, using other mods you can include all oblivion and morrowind into skyrimtogether, and ST supports more than 24 players on a single instance yes.
---
Lol skyblivion and skywind aren't even fully released yet and they're only remaking games Bethesda already made.  Such fast work.  Also I'd love a source that Skyrim Together can play 24 players considering last time I played *earlier this year* it was capped at 8 players.
---
&gt;EDIT: if you just want people to "remake" fo76, they have there is literally a mod for FO4 that is the Appalachian wasteland at the time of FO4, so like 200 years after fo76.
---
As cool as these mods are for people, the roadmap is *new* content, not content that has already been developed and released by Bethesda that is being repurposed.  Please point me to an original mod for *any* Bethesda game that is of the scale of 76 that is made within the same or less timeframe.  Till then, good luck praying for modders that can program AAA updates in two months.
---
Nuclear Winter starts in June (check the roadmap) and Wastelanders starts in Fall 2019
---
They've been supporting this game with regular patches/updates/content/etc since day one, not just a year later.
---
Ya got it
---
I thought it was because you kill 51 players and become the overseer
---
Or maybe it was just a studio joke, since they knew dataminers would find this early and we had some speculation about aliens in the past, they knew it would throw us off the scent
---
I hope they do add it to the radio or just release it similarly to how they put out Country Roads.  This cover sounds ***way*** too good to not release!
---
This excites me.
---
Why is everyone forgetting that this is Battle Royale-in Fallout 76.
---
Trailers obviously make it look like it works, at launch this shit is going to be so busted and glitchy as always, and then be completely killed off by cheaters. Nobody is going to go "I want to play a BR game, better boot up FO76!"
---
The crashed space thing is currently in game.
---
Free week is like Black Friday. We all gonna be swimming in caps.  Level 5 legendary armor for sale 200 caps, special price for you today only my friend.
---
Perhaps 24 unique companions, and they all have their own homes on the map. When you log in, you have to go ask them to come with you. If they aren't home, ask someone else. Really excited for this, however it works!
---
Watoga is my favorite place to be.
---
Are you on Xbox
---
I didn't even read a third of what you said so sorry if you mentioned this but can you mod Ultracite Calibrated Shocks? I've got the flux.
---
Haters gunna hate man. Don't stop having fun, and have it at their expense.
---
Just feel like the game is incredibly unbalanced and favors unarmed t3 legends, etc. not sure how this will work out well, but hoping for the best.
---
Bunch of ppl gathered near the vault right now.
---
Some nice camps up here!
---
We already have plenty of NPCs in the game, the only new change here is a dialogue tree system and apparently more permanent consequences. I'm curious as to how that works because as of right now even nukes are temporary and server-exclusive.
---
There weren't any initially because the setting/story made sense for it. Now the story makes sense for people to come into the area and rebuild.  
---
It's almost like the player characters were supposed to reclaim an inhospitable wasteland or something.
---
Theres always the dynamite and laser pistol from previous fallout
---
I had my moment when my other coworkers picked up Anthem because it was going to be "THE" game.
---
I make sure to ask about how the game's going regularly, especially right after mentioning the latest or upcoming patch to FO76.
---
Oh yeah that could work really well. I didn't even think of that!
---
yes buy https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/buy-now buy now please
---
BR mode winning all games tomorrow and all future
---
The trailer shows the before and after, whats in game now and what will be for Wastelanders
---
I blame EA more than BioWare for not ‚ÄúNo Man Sky-ing‚Äù it
---
I adore Mosstown.  I‚Äôd live there if not for that fissure site.
---
Yeah, I usually don‚Äôt get excited over games
---
If I see a good camp I'll buy something from their vending machines to show my appreciation even if it doesn't interest me
---
No AMR. No that I can see after scrubbing the videos 5 times over
---
It's definitely available tomorrow, but I don't know if it's permanent or if it will go away after this week. This is all that Bethesda has said:
---
&gt;From June 10 through June 17, all of Fallout 76 is free to play across all platforms, including an exclusive sneak peek of Nuclear Winter.
---
2* is best if you want good enough. 3* is more for flexing rights if you want a true god-tier. Something like a junkie's explosive weightless. If you want something "good enough", then two chances at a junkie's explosive instead is a better option
---
It will likely be around 10am EST like usual updates. Expect two hours of maintenance on the servers too. Not sure why you'd think this time things would be any different.
---
ROFL, a BR isn't "new" content, it is trying to ride fortenite and PubG's coattails. They even literally use the "ring" pushing them to the middle exactly like the others. So if anything Bethesda is just remaking other games. Just like skyblivion and skywind are.
---
Also, yeah you obviously haven't been keeping up with skyrim together if you think they can only have 8 players, it was obvious when you tried to claim "stolen code" which turned out to be completely false, as when people actually looked at the code from SWF wasn't anywhere to be found. So you obviously don't know what you are talking about.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs what I was thinking. Ive always gone with 3* and only got a decent berserkers short hunting rifle that I was initially happy with, now I don‚Äôt use and I‚Äôm going to sell. Everything else has been trash.
---
I feel with the price of the 3* Armor that is always worth the gamble, I‚Äôve managed to get a couple of decent Armor pieces, although 8/10 are wood lol
---
Haha yeah I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if any of those were accurate. It could even have been a mix.
---
Which wall mounts? The non-bugs mounts?
---
Tbh idrc about lore. Lore be damned as long as the game is fun. Its a spin off game lmao
---
As someone who doesn‚Äôt really like any PVP in these types of games, I didn‚Äôt like the idea of content for Adventure Mode being locked behind Survival...
---
But, I just finished the Survival Weekly to get my Deathclaw, and it was kind of fun to go into a mode I‚Äôm not comfortable with for a very short, specific purpose, and then get out and continue with my main game.
---
Nuclear Winter will be the same way for me.
---
That little tidbit might not have reached a lot of people yet so spread that info.
---
so does NW preview start at midnight EST?
---
Fool me once...
---
I started clapping after everything else and my son came into the room to see what was happening.  Nice to be a fanboy again.
---

Ball clamps
---
I spat my coffee out at this comment, take my upvote!
---
Bethesda farmed out the shilling to the lowest bidder. This current batch can't even form complete sentences.
---
I‚Äôll be traveling for work all next week so I‚Äôll be on every evening from 5-10pm ET
---
gt: diealegend
---
still buggy as shit man
---
With the new unique camp objects that can be carried over they are kind of forcing me to play.
---
I'm not saying the guys at r/fallout are doing stupid shit.
---
Yeah, my first thought was a Centaur variant
---
My guess is people will be split among based on a certain choice in the new questline to be on a server with the new settlers or raiders.
---
that could be one issue, but half the time no one can hear me since they are in a group party or otherwise have area chat off
---
and I hear ya on the requests- like no, I am not gonna sell you my one star vampire handmade, I am trying to get rid of the damn 3 star minigun, cryolator and fatboy (and all that 3 star urban armor)
---
I stg the Purveyor seems more a curse to those of us who don't heavy gun...
---
I‚Äôll add you!
---
I use a double-barrel shotgun with the Enforcer perk.  Shoot their knees and they just hobble around.  Shoot both and they are crippled and can't get up.
---
A couple of weeks ago I was helping a low level who didn't have power armor yet so they couldn't go into the Nuke zone.  I lead about 20 Glowing ones from the golf club at White Springs out of the radiation zone and had them all crippled without killing them.  The low level that I was helping then took pot shots at all of them and then I finished them off.  It was the most fun that I've had in a while because of the challenge.
---
Ugh... This hasn't happened to me in months. I used to farm cap runs there and it would crash 50/50. 
---
Now I farm fusion cores there, so I really hope that shitty bug isn't back.
---
There's only a few really useful weapon legendaries, whereas most of the armor ones are either pretty useful or at least slightly beneficial. Weight reductions, rad reduction, AP Regen and the like.
---
I'd just like a place to build them For free or cheap to blue print them. Doing it at the airport is a great way to get killed.
---
Basically build servers.
---
All of the riot sets are, I'm pretty sure.
---
From my understanding,  only the loot rewards
---
Yeah. There's been some from the Sheepsquatch side quests, and pioneer bug daily. But there are ALOT still missing.
---
I'm just waiting for those amazing 1s like deathclaw, Mothman, scorchbeasts. Ohhhh yeahhh.
---
I mean I have multiple full sets of assassins sentinel that I don‚Äôt use anymore so you could just take my word for it.  I have no reason to make this shit up.  
---
Anyways, I‚Äôm prepared to prove it so you don‚Äôt have to take my word for it.
---
I guess I forgot to write it down, I don't have any power armor mods
---
If it helps stuff has been added continuously and Wastelanders update will cause a big shift in things here.
---
From what I've seen. It's like a week long beta
---
&gt; unoriginality
---
With perks? And nukes? And a strong PVE aspect? I'm not into battle royale games much so correct me if I'm wrong, but afaik the only thing close to any of these that other BR games do is apex's class system. We might even get mutations here, but since you come in clean it might not be the case. Maybe you find mutation serums as loot along the way
---
&gt; greed
---
Maybe? Can't prove or disprove it. Them wanting to make their game good will inherently bring them more money, so you can't separate them. This applies to any company - if it makes tons of money, it's doing something right. You're making people happy enough to give you money they otherwise wouldn't. It's irrelevant whether or not everybody else is doing it too if that's what people want, and the money clearly shows what people want
---
Lol same. I only have 4 charisma. Lone wanderer 3 and travel agent
---
If you like fallout you will get a copy... Welcome to the darkside!
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=5FjWe31S_0g
---
&gt;Boss Key Productions.  Radical Heights.  Ring a bell?
---
Honestly? No, but I Googled it and remembered it was that studio that Cliffy B started when he left Epic, and his big idea was to basically rip off his former company and create a derivative example of their work.
---
You have any examples of actual, legitimate, established companies going under after chasing the BR genre?
---
Don't bother answering, you'll just embarrass yourself further, and I'm done with your stupid bullshit.
---
During the press conference today I was watching the fan tributes and was thinking to myself "what a load of crap these are to make the fans feel like the most important thing to bethesda". I get that they care, but after reading this post I can begin to truly grasp how important the fan base is to these devs. I've respected bethesda for not giving up on 76, but I respect them even more now that I know that this happened. Thank you bethesda for truly caring to provide the community with quality games.
---
I seen this too and was wondering.     Man i can't wait for wastelanders.
---
We will see. I think the free to play will help tremendously and I also think Microsoft should put this on the gamepass as well. The youtube videos posted today are a bit sketchy as the dislike ratio was far outdoing the like ratio so we will see if this pays off in the long run.
---
I thought it was [this](https://imgur.com/a/wSbFYpF), but on closer inspection it seems to be a combat rifle.
---
&gt;total disasters at launch
---
uh, excuse me, but NMS actually **worked** at launch
---
Booooo.
---
...
---
But seriously, good luck on your endeavours!
---
I see people everywhere lol. Had 4 at my camp within 20 seconds of joining today. It was lit
---
I feel your concern, but part of the fallout experience to me at least was falling in love with the world I am in. Bethesda games might be full of bugs but when you walk into the fallout world you know you will come across some really cool interactions or random events. Take for example that random ghoul kid in the fridge in Fallout 4, you can choose to sell him to a slaver or reunite him with his family it was a neat little encounter that just having a void empty world does not fill. The reason I stopped playing was fallout 76 started feeling like an empty version of  Preston Garvey's fetch quest thing. No, I don't want to go save your damn settlement nothing ever changes or happens because of it haha
---
Same here I‚Äôve got so much hype!
---
It really depends, I have loved all of the previous games, but online games sorta burn me out.
---
Thanks, and also for being a good sport
---
No. PS4 
---
Thing is Sent. won't be used cause we'll be dealing with the storm, I only say Sent cause it's caused me problems. Things that'll be problems is the moving perks/armor and bloodied one shot builds that don't die.
---
Lolololol
---
I thought nuclear winter was launching tomorrow, but this would actually make sense if it will just be a beta. Todd Howard said in his IGN review that the one thing he would do if he could turn back time would be to give F76 a longer beta test with a more inclusive audience. A nuclear winter beta would be a perfect way of following up on that
---
Agreed. Id rather buy the battle coat separately, I don't need six repair kits nor 1500 atoms.
---
Where do I find the BR trailer?
---
Amount of players isn't the issue, amount of items and assets are. I can totally see being able to strip those things out to be able to run that amount of people.
---
Could be.  Maybe they were dropping legendaries into their box and took out the junk.  The weird thing is that it was bulked.  Usually most people do this to sell as it doesn't save any space except for lead and aluminum.  All you are doing is using up your plastic.
---
I agree. It's nice that the story is progressing naturally. Let's try not to kill them all.
---
They probably moved a comparable number; it went from all hands on deck to only one studio supporting it.
---
If you haven't yet, should pick up the BoS Recon rifle plans at Ft Defiance. Makes the perfect weapon to make and sell on the cheap to newbies. 
---
If looking at the entrance to the Fort, directly to the right is a terminal requiring a military ID. Plans learned from accessing said terminal.
---
&gt;ROFL, a BR isn't "new" content, it is trying to ride fortenite and PubG's coattails. They even literally use the "ring" pushing them to the middle exactly like the others. So if anything Bethesda is just remaking other games. Just like skyblivion and skywind are.
---
Right the whole game is already more than those modders have done since Skyrim has been released.  But aside from the BR mode there was the entire Wastelanders update which will undoubtedly be done faster by the team that can actually finish a game
---
&gt;Also, yeah you obviously haven't been keeping up with skyrim together if you think they can only have 8 players, it was obvious when you tried to claim "stolen code" which turned out to be completely false, as when people actually looked at the code from SWF wasn't anywhere to be found. So you obviously don't know what you are talking about.
---
Yeah that code theft was a total hoax.  That's why they [apologised for it](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.pcgamer.com/amp/skyrim-script-extender-devs-accuse-skyrim-together-modders-of-stealing-code/).  So you know, plagiarism is still plagiarism even if its unintentional.  Still would love to see the proof that it can support more than 8 people.
---
oh shit oh fuck

---
IS HE HOLDING AN ALIEN BLASTER OR A GAUSS PISTOL OR WHAT
---
My favorite part of fallout has always been helping or hurting settlements. There is a big difference from an RP perspective of helping humans rather than robots. Ths is a big thing for me. The lack of people to help is one of the reasons I returned FO76 at launch. If they do a good job of tuning this game around, I'll probably come back.
---
For what its worth I totally agree with ya. I really dont think they should be dedicating resources to a separate BR mode that is likely going to have exclusive rewards to take back to adventure that will force the rest of us to participate if we want the new content this game is constantly starving for. I'm super happy about the Wastelanders update but a bit salty that BR got priority when Fallout has never even been a pvp game until 76. Most fans of fallout like it for what it's been up until 76 and while there is of course crossover between that and people who like pvp content, I really dislike that there seems to be so much resources dedicated to pvp content when the game is still seriously lacking PvE content. Not to mention stability and such still need a lot of work and attention.
---
Crikey! It's really pissed off now!
---
Thank you, that's extremely helpful
---
Just want to thank you for the risks and efforts you've taken. Truly. I'm glad you got the chance to help bring us to see the game we have today. 
---
And if any devs see this, thank you for your passion and willingness to listen. I love this game, and I can see from what we've already gotten, that you love it too.
---
I've been saying this for months. I want to thank people that put crafting spots out for people to use.
---
It's nothing. The nuke has no set zone to launch it at. So you can launch it anywhere but near vault 76.
---
Part of me thinks part of unlocking the Vault has to do with the crashed ship.
---
Na.. Its all the good parts of 4 without the horrid story or voice acting. You'll love it!
---
But it was always just one studio supporting it
---
Aaand he deleted his account. Wonder why.
---
How would that work with friends though? Can you no longer play with your friends? Or will you be in a raider-controlled server with your friend while you automatically match into settler-controlled servers?
---
As the ‚ÄúPVP Bubblegum Bear girl‚Äù, just wanted to say glad you joined in and had fun with us! üòÇ We do events every other Sunday like this. :)
---
Uh, I know. But as of now there's no quests or events there.
---
I personally would love a BSS +1 STR Tire Iron
---
It is in the opening intro video too when you start a new character, probably my favorite part!
---
I don't like watching trailers cause I don't really want to watch spoilers.
---
Prices too much for your budget, eh?
---
I‚Äôm on right now if you want to run a little, get: chrispystan
---
And you will get them. CAN YOU DIG IT
---
&gt; There weren't any initially because the setting/story made sense for it. Now the story makes sense for people to come into the area and rebuild.
---
&gt; 
---
That's a great excuse for "Oh shit our plans didn't work out!".
---
Not playing it may result in not getting access to certain content or rewards that will frustrate a lot of people.
---
It was a content stream that is now over, yes. Everything from it is still in the game though. The only limited time event was faschnacht, but any masks/plans/camp decorations obtained from them still exist in the game as limited items
---
[Bethesda was 23 years early](https://www.reddit.com/r/PewdiepieSubmissions/comments/byt5hf/bethesda_was_23_years_early/)
---
Who the hell is downvoting this lmao ?
---
i guess im coming back home boys
---
Prior to release? It was their multiple studios in different states.
---
You sound like you buy apple products simply because it's apple
---
What long-term hazards have been "cleared" that have stopped large groups of settlers and raiders?
---
You should write a comprehensive pricing list of what everything is worth. I see a lot of people asking what stuff is worth. I try to help out as much as I can but don't usually have the time.
---
Been helping Newbs since I got to level 40. Decking them out in lvl  appropriate armor and a weapon plus some stimpaks and rad away
---
Hey...maybe unrelated, but I found a dead vault dweller in an outhouse at Prickett‚Äôs Fort...
---
ikr ikr ! ! can't wait for that update  ! !
---
What‚Äôs getting added? A little out of the loop
---
I've tried a few times to get back into the game.  When the silo bug crashed me 3 straight times and prevented me from launching nukes I quit. I came back once fixed specifically to launch a nuke - which I did - but I couldnt get back into it. This sounds more like the fallout I like and love so I am hoping it is enough to get me back into it. But its going to be hard. I'll try it though!
---
I Feel like YouTube is a little to negative and clickbaity and this sub is a little to positive and neglecting of legitimate criticism.
---
I was a bit skeptical at first of the Battle Royale, but the trailer has me intrigued.
---
xavier: reneRAD angel?
---
You act like there aren't millions of consumers out there who are casual gamers, and have never heard of Fallout. They've heard of Fortnite though. Having a Battle Royale mode might make thousands of people look into what Fallout 76 is, yes. And some of those people might like what they see.
---
I‚Äôm going to honest I‚Äôm a little salty that it‚Äôs not a Area 51 type deal full off aliens. But who knows maybe it is and the overseer gets alien weapons and I‚Äôm jumping the gun.
---
Yup. Didn‚Äôt heard much but what I did hear sounds awesome. I actually prefer the FO76 cover of country roads to the original.
---
I'm not certain how expecting a fully functional game at launch is a bad thing... I mean it's like walking to subway paying for a meatball marinara and getting the bread at full price, then getting the meatballs a few hours later for a little more money, and vegetables for more.
---
Might have to start playing again... Been a while.
---
No better time, you can try the free week starting tomorrow and then buy it if you decide you like it
---
Your grammar is all that I hate, quite honestly.
---
No it was always just one stuido prior to release
---
True true but I'm gonna be running around all week, I'm heading to E3 this week. won't have time to really sit down and play it, you know?
---
Looks like a chimpanzee if you look at the hand-like feet, long arms and facial structure
---
I don't have the game, I am just largely uninterested in battle royal.
---
on their website
---
Robot armor plans can also be a random plan drop reward for treasure maps... (be sure to pray to the RNG gods before you start)
---
Wondering the same thing!
---
It‚Äôs worth buying. If you like other fallout games you‚Äôll like this one. Plus, it just keeps getting better. *knocks on wood*
---
bringing back npcs, finally the wasteland wont feel so dead
---
Let's not push it.
---
I personally don't care, I just know romance was a big thing in FO4 and I could see them try to carry that over.
---
It's well worth $30.
---
Can you explain what you mean by over provisioning your ssd properly? I gave it a quick google and found that it basically means leaving some free space in your ssd to give it an easier time writing to it. How do i know if there's enough free space? 
---
I got this game yesterday and have noticed some slight freezing and stuttering every so often, though not as bad as OP, and I've got a pretty good system, so hopefully there's an easy fix for it.
---
I'm the girl trying to sell my body. We enjoyed having you! Cone back next Sunday!
---
I get off to Todd lying to my face
---
If so, I foresee a lot of harlots and jezebel's in the near future being visited by multiple people at the same time.
---
Shudders...
---
I bet its going to be a new vault added. Same way vault 51 was put in during wild Appalachia.
---
Great now Preston Garvey's great grandfather is coming to mark settlements on my map to go and protect...
---
Are you allowed to discuss who you went with?
---
Well, looks like it‚Äôs time to buy FO76 lol
---
Probably same as usual 9am est.
---
Can you tell us if they had a foreseeable plan for the future or was the team working more in response to the community with creating new content? I totally understand that you can‚Äôt go into detail I‚Äôm just curious about how they plan on moving forward and how they have been responding to player recommended content. Thanks and that was a super awesome read!
---
NP. Good luck with your search...
---
Looks like I need to get leveled up! Can't wait for this to come out!
---
Hopefully we can have raider settlers for our camps, or something similar
---
Oh man I didn‚Äôt even think about that! That would‚Äôve been rad!
---
I can‚Äôt wait to be Boone‚Äôs sidekick while he headshots everyone.
---
West tek, whitespring golf club, robco research center, the burrows. Just to name a few. Also look out for horde events. Guaranteed legendary.  (Well once in a blue moon its a regular boss type)
---
Eat his eyes eat his sweet little eyes
---
Sounds crap. The people who like those games probably don't like Fallout, and vice versa.
---
Plant corn and make soup
---
I hope they achieve the next step in more flexible development so we can hopefully one day get better hotfixes for some pressing issues instead of everything piling up for the "next" patch
---
Can't say with great certainty but I almost wonder if isn't like the old fan theory regarding Lucas's horrible Star Wars 1-3 and JarJar Binks (spelling?).   
---
In short JarJar was going to be a Sith Lord, so all of those bungles, mistakes and improbable or impossible situations were the work of a force master, but Lucus cowed to the masses and aborted the idea, resulting in the abominations we got.  
---
But in this case Bethesda stuck to their guns, weathered the hate, and kept to the timeline..  
---
Supporting evidence?   
---
From the beginning we found data pointing to "normal" NPCs, it's one of the things that fueled the rage in the beginning regarding no living NPC's...    
---
It also explains why some of these locations were so awesome but at the same time strangle underdeveloped (crashed space station for example).  
---
But that's my theory after getting to see a little bit of what's behind the curtain
---
Well, the unceasing positivity of this sub is generally good for my opinion of the game.
---
Crashed ship? Do you mean the space station? This could definitely expand on the raiders vs settlers arc.
---
I sell all my ammo for 1 cap. No matter what it is.
---
Thar's true - cause you will be disappointed more often than not.
---
We‚Äôre got a group of about 10-12 people total that are usually in. I‚Äôll send a message I vite next time I get on.
---
Don‚Äôt forget Sea of Thieves!
---
Same here! It would be fun that's for sure!
---
Same - GT QuasarSilva
---
I believe in the complete opposite of this. The newbies who are coming are most likely the people who ridicule others for having played the game for so long. Once BR starts even though I'm not much of a PvP fan I'm going to play it and make those players quit the game. I won't be showing any kindness even if they're 12.
---
Yeah he may have been a moody bastard, but he was a hell of a marksman.
---
Same. Hate going to a persons camp and see they are selling .50 ammo 5 caps a pop.
---
Haters going to hate... Even games they dont play! Also your now banned from fallout sub... Fyi üòÖ
---
I pick up every food thing i can and cook it up whenever i can
---
BR Needs to die
---
Thank you!
---
Sexy new npc- "If we had a blacklight, my camp would look like a Jackson Pollock painting".
---
I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll give us an updated roadmap of when they kind of expect things to happen and to be coming out
---
Oof
---
Dog food
---
Get can do and good doggy perks and pick up alll the canned dog food
---
I was thinking about that beast of a gun today! Hope it makes a come back!
---
I typically cook everything and save found preservable food for when I‚Äôm running into fewer mobs.
---
NO V.A.T.S.
---
Praise Atom
---
Agree.
---
It's there on the website though.
---
I mean there are tons of people to interact with and they are not just pre programmed responses
---
Even at full price,  the game time you can get out of 76 compared to others makes it worth it
---
Everyone was dead. They died, became scorched, or left. The trailer says THEY CAME BACK. This was the plan all along. It‚Äôs in the story most people just don‚Äôt pay attention.
---
Me too! Was a really fun part of the game - couldn‚Äôt go it alone without Hancock or Dogmeat
---
Herbavore perk + green thumb = very hard to go hungry
---
The last bit wasn't true for me. Just level 3 Animal Friend and I got a Deathclaw as a guardian for my camp.
---
Yeah.. Especially since their last Inside the Vault only details their E3 presentation and the combat update for patch 10.
---
I‚Äôm not on fallout right now but I‚Äôll add you if you want to play later
---
No, and this is where I again call out Bethesda.  
---
Hundreds of them are dead easy, I'm talking if I had a week with CK and XEdit I could have them all fixed.   
---
Missing MA keywords, missing attach points, broken MODCOL's (leveled lists for upgraded) and missing constructables are easy as heck to fix.    
---
And I do know what I'm talking about here, glance at some of my bug round ups and you'll see I've been giving them literally the exact fix, down to the formID, for countless things
---
Wait for gamescom
---
If you take sunshine meadows industrial farm, the machine there makes packaged food that doesn't spoil, keep about 20 Salisbury steak in your stash for emergencies, and carry a few on you
---
Mostly eat the random stuff you pick up and cook but this way you'll always have food if you run out :)
---
Hope that helps :)
---
I mean, the story they wrote for 76 totally makes sense this way. They said the story of 76 will evolve. That's what we did. We emerged, we prepared the land by fighting off the plague and now, we must rebuild.
---
Sounds good üëç
---
Casual gamers paying money to play Fallout 76 BR when they can play one of the massively popular and well known BRs that are out there for free. Sorry but a casual gamer is 100% going to download Fortnite or Apex to try BR over paying money for a game with terrible reviews. When it comes to a well received and free game whose focus is on BR  and a poorly made critically panned game where BR costs money and is just a side mode. There is only one choice that makes any sense
---
I was going to say this. Easy to get!!
---
I‚Äôll add you in a bit üëç
---
It‚Äôll be fun to pop into a few times a day with friends, just like I do with Firestorm in BFV. I‚Äôm not usually a fan of BR, but the way they‚Äôve taken it looks really interesting.
---
Prediction: it‚Äôll be buggy at launch but have a lot of cool mechanics.
---
Ding ding ding. I don‚Äôt understand how people don‚Äôt get this.
---
I think it‚Äôll be tricky enough having supposed choice/consequences involved with npc‚Äôs in an online game. I wouldn‚Äôt push for anything more.
---
Tomorrow for a week GT : Shearluck I‚Äôll help youll
---
It's easier complaining about "bad" parts if you ignore the good parts
---
I'm at 400 hours. It's worth 30 bucks.
---
And in the Q and A section of the last inside the vault, a dev said they're very open to having faschnacht more then just once a year ingame since the robots are allowed to have it whenever and that they'd like to do more holiday events like that.
---
This^
---
Thank you I feel like I'm explaining that to people constantly, I've been saying npcs were coming since I found that responder bot ordering people to evacuate
---
Quit playing dumb, please. You made a post titled "If you're not excited by the E3 announcement for FO76 then you have issues." I called you out for saying exactly that. Neither of us were "vague."
---
And who cares if it's free? Free doesn't change the fact that some people don't like a thing. Be that the game itself, battle royales or whatever. It being free isn't going to magically make somebody suddenly like it. 
---
And nobody has "issues" for not liking it.
---
I just pick up dog food from time to time and ah e good doggy and food has been a non issue for a long time
---
I just thought it's a new breed of Centaurs.
---
Fuck. Yeah.
---
If a bi female thing isn't one of them a lot of guys will be starting new characters &amp; ditching their female ones
---
Sure thing
---
They said many lvl 100+ players
---
thats great to hear!!
---
People can get so wrapped up in hating something that they view anyone enjoying it as an existential threat to their hatred.
---
yesss!
---
Did you see BE3?
---
So the dr from perk cards goes against berserker weapons? In hind sight I guess it makes sense but I always assumed it just meant from armor!! I learned something new today.
---
I will give it shot (ha ha)
---
Surprisingly no. I streamed for about 10 hours over the weekend, and aside from my regulars, who obviously like the content, the new people that showed up asked what had changed since launch and asked if it was worth picking up. I had a lot of that, gave my honest opinion on the game - both the pros and cons, described what I liked about it, why I'm still playing it after 600 hours, and tried to guide them in their choice of playing it or not. 1 person out of probably 50 new people that showed up came in to bash the game, and I just flat out told him "if you're only here to bash the game or spread hate, I'm just going to ban you". Scolded him pretty hard, because seriously, do you stand outside of movies you dislike yelling from the top of your lungs that you didn't like it? No. No one does that. It's rude behavior. Do you go to a concert and yell at people in the parking lot for enjoying the music enough to attend? No, of course not. So why is it OK to come to my stream and bash the game that we're all enjoying. I didn't have to ban him, and he didn't say a word afterwards.
---
Interesting,   
---
There‚Äôs a similar tentacled looks almost like a critter thing in Lucky Hole, too
---
Were you able to use camera mode to see the vault number on the back? Interesting find considering the space shuttle is gonna be a town
---
It warms my heart to know that someone on their staff is just as disappointed as some of us.
---
Same!  Sounded like the same singer so that and the instrumental had me sold.  I too prefer the cover over the original Country Roads, so here's hoping they don't disappoint!
---
This person is trying desperately hard to pretend that people are just hating on poor FO76 and are sooo dumb for doing so.
---
Was it always the intention to add dialogue later as part of the story progression? Or did feedback tell them that not having it was an issue and they responded by adding it? Either way a needed addition to the game.
---
After not playing since November I think I'll give it another go. See how much it's improved.
---
Yah. The balls on them. I'll just go bust my ass to make it then pay those prices.
---
I could not look at the comments during the showcase because it was mostly hate and saying they should just pull the plug. I can deal with the former but I cannot stand people saying this game should be shut down, who does that benefit? Their egos I guess. Good thing no one in their right mind would listen to those kind of people
---
 I really want a doggo companion, but I don't want to share my Dog food with it.  That shit is life.
---
Well Im happy that I was wrong, thought for sure it was going to be nothing but BR but now that theres NPCS I actually want to play again.
---
The whole game is whats free for a week. If you own the game, all dlc is always free including the BR
---
So far just the one meeting.   
---
Well and the slightly better path to report issues.   
---
I think, to be honest, they were waiting until after E3 to see if any of us breached our NDA's, because it's perfectly fine to give some trust, but we still have to prove ourselves worth it.
---
Totally understand, hell I've got that disclaimer in the post because I'm just another random dude on the Internet (assuming I'm being honest about that!).  
---
This post was reported on both the FO76 Sub and the Fallout sub dozens and dozens of times in the first 30 minutes, and it's been verified.  
---
I'd still love Bethesda to comment and back me up, as I am out on a limb..  
---
I doubt shutdown was an option, from the outside think of how much they had invested in '76 before launch, the storm they dealt with post launch (a good chunk, but not all deserved).  
---
Throwing up their hands and walking away would cost them so much, both monetarily and reputation wise, it would/could be unthinkable.  
---
But again, that's the opinion of a random anonymous internet stranger
---
I totally agree with this, and as a rule of thumb  most products should much cheaper than the recommended values, with legendaries being the exception. I mean, you‚Äôre selling stuff that you presumably have excess of otherwise, and it‚Äôs stuff we all find anyway.
---
hunt showdown has taken that approach
---
Hopefully soon its the 10th and its not live yet smh
---
Atomic shop. Lots of players have them because they were glitched and you could place them without actually purchasing them. The cat and deathclaw topiary. This has been patched and they must be purchased with atoms.
---
Now I‚Äôm super hyped
---
That's not the problem.  The problem is ppl charging more than 2 caps a bullet or more than 500 a serum.
---
Still 11pm here for me so well seen soon.
---
I'm actually very excited to try it out, and I was staunchly against a BR mode being added. For me, it's the fact that:
---
1. Everyone starts out even. No gear / level advantage. Only your game knowledge, skill, and luck will help.
---
2. 52 is pretty big! That's a lot of players on the map.
---
3. My game knowledge - knowing where power armor spawns, where high level enemies spawn, etc., will actually have a use.
---
4. No VATS - no OP one shot kill VATS builds. Skill only.
---
My only issue is that 20 minutes is not very long at all.
---
Fuck that, I‚Äôm calling the SCP foundation.
---
Never expected it to be lol. They said its so early development that they didnt even want to show what they did.
---
It's not broken. You probably have mod conflicts or an incompatible ini file that needs updating.
---
I always hoped they would for sure and figured this would be the story they used. Still very curious what it will look like and how companions will go down. Super stoked though!!
---
That and the deathclaw hedge were a "free" atom shop item that was accidentally available for a limited time from the crafting menu. Anybody who built it gets to keep theirs, but it was since removed and is no longer possible to craft because it was a bug to begin with
---
Juice head literally doesn't do that tho lol. Talk to yong yea about that shit. Juicey boy has been hella fair about fo76
---
Prob this week, no one here knows this
---
Thanks!
---
I'm not to into the whole Battle Royale part. But very interested to see how they implement the human npcs or maybe new gameplay mechanics into 76.
---
Nah ea sucks but BioWare dropped the ball on this one chief, loot system sucks, loot also didn‚Äôt really adjust properly in the beginning so a common and rare stats didn‚Äôt matter much.
---
The one thing ea did do eas make them make skins barebones so they could probably sell them  later
---
But updates happen on Tuesdays right?
---
Probably when the atom shop resets, so the new stuff will come out too. Maybe 8-10am est?
---
This may come as a shock to you.. 
---
Devs make battle royales... Because people enjoy and play them.
---
:0
---
Its gonna be a huge update. I bet that includes balancing
---
Kinda hard to imagine that there are people who don't speak perfect English.
---
I can't imagine how Bethesda work but from my experience in games development once the design was finished it was pretty much stuck to unless there major reasons it couldn't be implemented, I reckon you're spot on.
---
Trickle down content in multiplayer games like this can be great, but Bethesda would really have benefited from clarifying that the content they're looking to add is less like mothership zeta and more like time skipping forward in the game.
---
I get they probably wanted to surprise people but they'd have been as well addressing things like the space station by saying yeah there's nothing there YET.
---
I am one of those new people. As soon as I can I'll be getting the trial. The trial will probably be make or break on whether or not I get the full game. Hope to have fun with you all!
---
Get carnivore mutation and eat everyone and everything!
---
 Meat is 2x more beneficial and you don't have to cook it anymore as you won't get disease from it. You can pair that with cannibal perk and feast on your enemies corpses.
---
Yeah, it seems like every sub for a popular game has at least one person that does nothing but complain about the game while adding nothing positive to the community. I don't understand why they don't just leave the sub.
---
Its def gonna have its own rewards, if not itd have no incentive to keep playing the br
---
I think it would have been boring to just run through vault corridors though. Part of the staple of BR is a big open map. I am now suddenly interested in a fallout experience where you just run through corridors and there could be a deathclaw or player around any corner - sounds like an interesting horror game
---
Great pull, your like the second person to get the reference!   
---
    
---
I will neither confirm nor deny being close to that number and your damned right it has issue...    
---
But it's still a fun game.   
---
I learned, painfully, a long time ago I only have the right to gripe if I've got skin in the game.  
---
It's legit to say buying the game give you that investment, but for me if I don't try and make something better I have no right to criticize.    
---
And thanks, it's a uphill and brutal slog, but it's easier when people are grateful for the invest.
---
There's a mod for that. I'm not joking, it turns scorched into Todd Howard, which is very disturbing.  [https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/309?tab=posts](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/309?tab=posts)
---
Very smart move Bethesda
---
Anyone else who submitted the form for the replacement bag and had a ticket on Bethesda.net recently notice there were no open tickets? I checked back a month or 2 ago and the ticket that was approved and awaiting update no longer shows. I'm wondering if others have the same issue and if I should be worried it was deleted.
---
Your friends sound like small brain mouth breathers. If you enjoy the game who cares tell them to go play whatever dumb game they like. If they don‚Äôt respect the fact you enjoy things they aren‚Äôt your real friends.
---
Too funny. What do you have against armor?
---
At some point there should be a revamp update, so we can actually have that 16x the detail
---
Settlers probably gonna come from the locked door next to the crashed space station
---
The game has NPCs? The fact that they're human now changes nothing. The only change is that we will now have dialogue trees with them. If Biv or the scout leaders had a dialogue tree, wastelanders would not be any different from them
---
I was watching this at work and when my friend and I saw nods we literally freaked out on hype lol
---
Glad they made sure to not let players bring their gear and SPECIAL to the new mode, might actually try it just to get the stuff from it but omg the NPCs are coming back and that was what this game was missing!
---
Thanks I hope they bring them back I want to buy it. I'm the crazy cat lady ( no joke). lol
---
I‚Äôll try it. If I like it I‚Äôll keep doing it. If I don‚Äôt like it I‚Äôll stick to adventure. Not the end of the game just another mode.
---
I am guessing 8-10am est most likely
---
Kind of new? And it‚Äôs a note.
---
A paper saying you were insulted added to your inventory.
---
tbh battleroyal will be pretty fun. only people it will be on a level playing feild and i bet you gotta run around scavenging for ammo supplies and such. its much more balanced and does create a skill-based envoirment. now will it be better then rust or other BR's.. probably not. However theres fallout NPC's thrown into the mix. it might be good.
---
Wastelanders yes. Nuclear winter will go the way of survival and I'll never touch it.
---
1500 atoms 6 repair kits and an elder coat I believe.
---
Yeah, the ad revenue from shitting on the game is irresistable. And the clickbait possibilities with a free week and battle royale mode are almost endless. I'm hoping this changes things for the better though, if you check r/fallout they actually seem to be mostly happy with this
---
It spooks me something good
---
Haha that's pretty funny
---
Sigh guess we will end up all being a stealth archer
---
It‚Äôs been around for a while
---
When does the trial go live? I'm excited to try this game!
---
Just started playing 76 again recently since not playing it after launch. The community made me fall in love with it. As they said at the conference it truly is the best community out there. This makes me only more excited to play it!
---
Because it's "battle royale". And in a fallout game. That's literally why. The videos are already popping up. "Bethesd has completely lost it". "Did Bethesda just have the worst E3?". I honestly don't fucking get it. I thought the show was fine and the nuclear winter mode looks interesting. People need to calm the fuck down. God there is just no fighting it it seems. Bethesdas reputation is 100 percent in the gutter. They are the new company everyone hates now like EA
---
1. Play on adventure mode. No one can harm you unless you turn pacifist mode off and fire back at them.
---
2. It does take a long time to get well geared and be able to easily solo some of the harder content like Scorchbeast Queen, but MOST of it is very easy. If you're willing to follow a build you'll do fine.
---
3. Most players are very happy to help you. People stand outside of Vault 76 and give away ammo, weapons, plans, etc. Even the people that like to PvP on survival mode do this kind of stuff usually.
---
Bethesda please please bring it back I need to buy it.
---
I mean I‚Äôll give it a try to see how it is, but holy crap I‚Äôm so excited for the wastelanders update
---
You're too focused on the BR aspect dude. You need to get out more.
---
Thanks, we all got to do our part of it want it to be the game of our dreams right?
---
Right? I didn't even consider companions but now that you mention it the video did say something like "we'll fight too. Right beside you"
---
So exciting lmao can't wait til we get more info
---
YESSSS
---
If you're on ps4? I can try to help defend
---
Hopefully they‚Äôve realized one of the biggest issues is the lack of good loot drops and that the Vaults should be really well thought out and have some great incentives to keep players going.
---
No they are not at all. ESO was completely made by Zenimax. The parent company. Bethesda is the child company. ESO did utilise the same engine but it's pretty much completely reengineered and barely resemblance the old format.
---
opposite actually, mrs. negative nancy. mr.s Oh free content better cry mrs. look I paid just to whine and mope the entire duration of the games development mrs. I paid for this game just so I could feel like my opinion is validated!
---
Wait how are they different? I don‚Äôt see it
---
One of the articles related to this states that sadly, you will have to. It mentioned that you will have to progress through the nuclear winter mode to unlock more parts of vault 51. The "leaked" stuff from foreign translations also talked about reaching certain overseer levels, so that backs it up. Hopefully the stuff will be tradeable though
---
Ehhh. let's not. The server already craps itself with 10+ people farming nuked whitesprings or fighting queen.
---
it has a "way cheaper than licensing Cash" vibe
---
edgy
---
What
---
I wish I had problems like these
---
Omg it's a real fallout game!
---
And it's not always the default option either. Sometimes fast travel is, sometimes it's kick. So just when you get used to tapping E twice to fast travel, BOOM, you kick them.
---
True reddit is terrible.  I was on keto subreddit and I kept asking questions about keto *gasp* I know insane isnt it? And I got downvoted and locked out of my own posts because i guess my questiond qeremt orthodox enough for them.  Fuck reddit lol or maybe it's just the keto one
---
You really are not competing with players, unless you want to.
---
I'm curious too, I don't pvp but want to know the effects of giving out a god-tier weapon for pretty much free with how easy the challenges were. The meta is constantly evolving, so I'd assume people are catching on to this and going ranged to beat the bloodied melee, and then the bloodied melee is changing to counter that, and it keeps going. Where are we at now in this cycle?
---
Yep.  Keep up the good work.  See you in Appilatchia.
---
Short answer: do not miss out on this opportunity, you will do great and have so much fun.  
---
In-depth: Actually if you started now from scratch having never played it you will get the best possible experience with regards to your concern  I say that because the concept of players being NPCs when everyone is the same level in the beginning can be hit or miss.  However, at this point you will meet some really great player NPCs that will do more for you than any game NPC would.  People will help you, show you things, and have the resources to put toward you.  In some ways I‚Äôm actually envious.  It‚Äôs like a movie you wish you could unsee so you could see it all again for the first time!
---
I'm excited for the NPCs. In my opinion, the NPC's should have been in the game from Day 1, because just having human players populate the world and only holotapes, dead bodies and monsters was and is never enough to make an entertaining and interesting world or story. How that creative decision got approved is beyond me.
---
I personally think the Battle Royale thing is a massive joke. The game can barely handle 24 players let alone 52 and all the moving parts that a Battle Royale mode entails. The engine is ancient, clunky and very buggy at the best of times, do you really think that it will come in at the same quality as other Battle Royale modes?
---
Even IF, and it's a BIG if, the battle royale mode by some miracle works perfectly... who really will care? The market for the mode is beyond saturated between Fortnite, PUBG, Apex, Battlefield, Black Ops 4 and countless other iterations on the formula. Who in their right mind thought that Fallout 76, a game they knew from the jump was going to be a bit of a mess thought "hey, you know what this needs? a BR mode!"?
---
tl;dr: I'm hyped for NPC's. I think the BR mode is a waste of time and resources, I don't think it will do well because the market is way over saturated and frankly I don't think the engine Fallout 76 runs on can handle that many players and mechanics in one mode properly.
---
The story isn't done yet, there's still 2 content drops after this. You're just not anticipating the final retcon where we blow up West Virginia.
---
You‚Äôre straight up killing me dude.  
---
I‚Äôll just tell you how to kill somebody that‚Äôs not damaged bug then and I‚Äôll be outta here:
---
1.   Don‚Äôt initiate PvP if you don‚Äôt want to die at least once.  If you initiate pvp in adventure mode you‚Äôre dead.  The person who returns fire has a huge advantage.  Let them initiate then return fire and don‚Äôt stop shooting until they‚Äôre dead. 
---
2.  Don‚Äôt get shot, period.   PvP is not standing in front of one another and trading shots.  Most people do this for some reason.  Then they seek revenge and run straight back into the fight only to get killed again.   Use cover and stealth.  PvP in this game is very much about skill and strategy whether people believe it or not.  End of story. 
---
Pick your battles!  If you can‚Äôt invite someone to a team, they‚Äôre already on a team and you might get ambushed!  PvP is not one on one.  
---
3.  Concentrated fire for every single build and target the head if they are standing and vatsable.  Vats critical is instant kill so high luck and vats luck cards are king and allow you to build crits much faster. 
---
4.  Since you said Gatling laser I assume you‚Äôre a heavy build so the card One Gun Army is mandatory.  For rifles it‚Äôs tank killer and shotguns it‚Äôs enforcer. It induces stagger which cancels the sentinel effect.  Also, get yourself an LMG if you don‚Äôt have one.  Any will do to start.  
---
None of that is new and since the assassins sentinel cavalier nerf it‚Äôs much less necessary than it once was but the theory stands.   
---
Otherwise, just keep fighting.  Practice with your friends.  Win or lose, the important thing is you learn.  Don‚Äôt take getting killed personally.  All pvpers die often. 
---
I‚Äôll repeat it one more time. There are no hard to kill builds out there.  None.  If you‚Äôre struggling to kill they‚Äôre bugged or you have to change your strategy.
---
Do you mind me asking what your stream is? I'd love to check you out sometime.
---
I... think I'm gonna go head back over to where that Mirelurk queen was.
---
What else are we talking about here? We are just talking about the BR mode of Fallout 76. And what does how much I go outside have to do with a conversation about BR? No need to get salty just because I refuted your silly argument. People like you always turn to insults after they run out of counter arguments. When you start insulting the other person it‚Äôs like a big flashing sign telling everyone you‚Äôve lost the argument.
---
Nothing really. I had never really set up my account as FO76 was my first Xbox game (been playing all the other fallout games on pc though. I think the first time I went nude was shortly after the BETA when I accidentally sold the clothes off my back and then ran around for like 2 hours butt naked and only noticed when some other players were cracking up. So I figured to myself, how funny would it be to figure it all out and find a way to be that one guy happy as a clam running around in his boxers where everyone else was under three layers of armor. The GT TighteyWhiteyMan was available and the rest is history.
---
I did,i actually watched E3 just to see FO76.I was honestly expecting much less,although i don't NPCs are gonna be what people are expected when they launch.most likely 2 factions with quest,dialogue and possibly vendors. As far as BR goes,it might be fun to play sometimes,im happy with what they showed overall. im excited to see what year 2 brings!
---
I fail to see how a dev company actively improving and updating their game is screwing people
---
I think they had all this roadmapped out well before release. They're Bethesda, they don't really wing it.
---
One tiny teeny problem...theyre gonna be broke noobs. Whatcha gonna sell them for? 5 caps?
---
It‚Äôs really not that good, there are way better weapons in the game.
---
Melee is broken right now anyway, most swings don‚Äôt even work and you can‚Äôt vats players who jump.
---
If someone is going to try and melee me, I jump
---
honestly, if you like the game thats all that matters man. Everyone has an opinion and will not always agree with your preference in games but hey that's what makes us different from everyone. Just drown out your friends' opinions, screw em! just keep playing the game!
---
Scrap your junk before you stash it
---
No. Fucking no.
---
I love the Hellfire armour it's a great set but this blatant disregard for lore has got to bloody stop! I was upset when they made X-01 prewar in Fallout 4 but I could manage, the BoS in the east coast so early on was a sensible enough reasoning but them being fully formed logo and all by then was a bit of a stretch, but this? This is just flat out dumb, use whatever "prototype" nonsense you want this is DUMB. Wasting limited resources on the T-60 when a superior X-01 suit existed at the same time was bad enough but if this shit gets released then we'll be told to believe that a USA starving for resources decided to green light three different suits of armour at once while one was clearly superior to the other two.
---
So if you know what that is, I'm assuming you know that it doesn't make too much sense for that suit to exist at this point in time. You don't have a problem with that? I can't decide myself yet but we still don't know if they'll write it in or if its just cosmetic or what the deal is.
---
Yep, can confirm have perks that grant DR totally negate berserker weapons.
---
Really? I've never even heard about this until like 10 minutes ago and I'm happy I did this is the best random encounter in the game
---
Bro, you do realize you're not viewing this objectively at all. You're way too over passionate about this video game and can't see why they would want to market a BR. Even Bethesda disagrees with you, otherwise they wouldn't have built a BR in the first place. Take a chill pill
---
I‚Äôm German, so I guess I‚Äôll try.
---
This br isn't just a br, needs a new term.
---
I just want a dog companion, not a human lol
---
I promise you I‚Äôm completely chill dude. Don‚Äôt project your emotions onto me. Just because you‚Äôre getting upset doesn‚Äôt mean I am too.
---
Kind of upsetting though. Looks like something from silent hill. I would've been happier with just a messed up looking bigfoot if this is the case.
---
Atleast the snallygaster resembles somewhat of a animal/creature. That just looks like an un-imaginative abomination of parts, like from a horror game.
---
It's $9.99.
---
Confused is this going to be paid DLC or is this free stuff?
---
Definitely easy and quick way to get food, but by no means perfect. 
---
My only concern would be that your crops are the first to go when enemies spawn near your camp. So you're constantly repairing them unless you can figure out a way to keep them well protected. 
---
Some of the camps I've seen, they build their camps around the crops. So all crops are in the center and protected by walls all around.
---
Maybe others here have some suggestions on farming tactics.
---
Oooof..... All game studios are about money. It‚Äôs how they succeed.
---
no he was added in a few patches ago and it should be a note saying you were insulted in your inventory
---
They told us from the start that every human we saw in the game would be a real player. I knew what I was buying when I got the game. People complained about it, but they told us this from the start. Now they are bringing an update that will add human NPCs. It will be interesting to see how this works out. I for one think it should only be available after you've completed the bulk of the main game and able to launch a Nuke. Going to be odd to come out of Vault 76 as a brand new character with human NPCs running around the World. We'll have to wait an see how they handle this.
---
Oof my canon
---
Yeah, time to clean out my CAMP, move it to the new player zone, and start stocking a bunch of cheap goods (and free stuff!) for the new guys. Help get 'em going right.
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt know I like how they‚Äôre making their creatures. It seems original. The only other guess I have is that the thing has something to do with the Interloper
---

---
Probably going to become available with an update in about 9-10 hours. That's when they usually do maintenance and updates.
---
Just got back to my AirBnB...    
---
Let me start by saying I can't talk about everything yet, but I will cover what I feel is safe.   
---
-I've not played allot of recent BR style games, since the early days of Halo and Goldeneye to more recent examples the "twitch gaming" style that was often easy to exploit was unattractive to me.    
---
-The system was light weight and although it involves your character directly, and your character benefits from the BR encounters, everything is streamlined in a very clean way.    
---
-The BR has freaking story content, SERIOUSLY!  
---
-Equipment is balanced in a way that completely resolves the problem(s) PVP sufferers from in Adventure/Survival mode currently.  
---
-See above with other aspects of the BR.  
---
-There is allot of freedom in the BR mode, again I don't want to detail an experience in the Alpha that is drastically different to Launch, but some of the "teammate range" issues other similar games suffer from isn't there.  
---
-It has Power Armor, need I say more!
---
Hey. Some of us are stealth mages.
---
I might install again. 
---
As a returning player should I remake a toon or try to use my level 30 that had 5000 frag grenades?
---
So does everyone else, once you land someone dies lol.
---
Kill mole rats and build water purifiers.  I have 5 small water purifiers and one industrial running.
---
Seriously. mole rats are everywhere.  Just cook them up and eat them.  I get so much food just from killing creatures that I sell canned dog food in my store instead of eating it.
---
Agreeed
---
On Bethesda‚Äôs website they mention companions and raiders. They also mention new factions or something like that.
---
The poletists
---
There will be companions, I don‚Äôt know about the rest. I can find you a source a bit later if you want.
---
Again I played an Alpha, but in theory there were rewards that carried over.
---
I think this make difference from any battle royale. According to the trailer, there are mobs around the maps, too. Which make it difference from other battle royale game.
---
Let's just wait then.
---
I think it would be pretty funny if there were an NPC with the Garvey last name who's hinted to be one of Preston's ancestors, who's especially *enthusiastic* about helping out the new settlers in the region.
---
bow. a bow.
---
Its a bloodied dcg lol. Been in the game since thr start üòÇ
---
You do realize that this is an Onion article, right?
---
There‚Äôs a bit more detail here. Doesn‚Äôt say anything about romance, but it looks like there will be a Raiders vs settlers faction choice. 
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/5AMlSKCHTSbAZkycWDhq0z/fallout-76-wastelanders-and-nuclear-winter-revealed
---
I'm in so hard you can call me Preston Garvey!
---
Good point, the vault would need to be extravagant, large open atriums and etc. Not exactly sure what it what it would be like but the experience you‚Äôre describing is along the lines of what I had I mind.
---
I think it's definitely a step in the right direction. I wish it was something more than raiders vs. minute men though (yeah the name "minute men" isn't used but that's pretty much what it is).  I wish there was an option to maybe side with BOS or Enclave remnants.
---
I think 2* while you need weapons and 3* when you want to min max.
---
Yeah, one of the more distinctive weapons from New Vegas that we've been wanting to see again for some time. It's definitely a nice addition to look forward to!
---
I think a huge, hulking, behemoth sized big foot with mutated features (like sheepsquatch), would've been really cool.
---
What about cyberdog that's been roaming the wasteland since the bombs fell?
---
I pve more than pvp. So if the battle royale game mode data separate with current pve data. I'm in.
---
If this rolls out well and delivers on what it promises, I will happily come back to this game.

---
I just started streaming Fallout 76 consistently again this weekend. I streamed a bunch at launch but was really fed up with people bashing it constantly. I think MOST of that is done now... hopefully. 
---
I streamed leveling a new character (in my own way - running two accounts at once to power level) for the new survival mode reward Unstoppable Monster, a sweet bloodied deathclaw gauntlet. Playlist link for the two live streams:

---
Live streamed the BE3 tonight as well over some Path of Exile. I do lots of different games - Diablo 3, PoE, Fallout 76, but my channel is most well known for Fallout 4 and other single player RPGs.
---
!@#$ it's not God tier by any means. People have had plenty of time to find instigating powerfists, etc.
---
Grape Mentats and Formula P could be useful for more than bartering now.
---
Who is the group? I really wanna put them on my Spotify.
---
Basically the Insult Bot is a college group's experiment, and it walks around showing up randomly. It finds you, and asks you to wait while it comes up with an appropriate insult, to which it reads to you then hands you your insult ticket.
---
https://open.spotify.com/track/71VE8cfurebqCy7tXqfrWj?si=oaeQq1JmTlaW0fOJNXkbvw
---
The unstoppable monster is a bloodied deathclaw gauntlet?  I had no idea!  Seriously though how did you acquire it previously?
---
Is it dying or just evolving? This mode they are proposing seems a bit different. Could be a good move. Bringing more people to Fallout76 is a good thing. This could do that. Especially if it seems a bit different.
---
Thanks, just trying to do my part to be unbiased and Balanced.   
---
And of course to get broken s*{^ fixed.  
---
I won't claim the BR mode will be for everyone, and it's not going to be my primary focus even as enjoyable as it was.  
---
That said, IMHO it's going to be fantastic for when you have 20 minutes to kill, or you need a change of pace after a brutal grind or disappointing dungeon crawl.  
---
It was refreshingly different, while still clearly Fallout
---
No idea what that removed post said, but I just wanted to say I'm thrilled that your effort paid off, u/Atem_ra . Ever since I was "introduced" to you through your bug report posts, I've had immense respect for your dedication in pushing for bugs to get noticed and fixed, and being empathetic towards other players experiencing bugs. You n
---
Also, despite some members of the sub resorting to uncivil measures because they felt you were "attacking" the game, you always remained composed and civil, which is admirable. Your pasion for getting things fixed made me, a person initially agressively apathetic about FO76, actually care because I wanted to see people like you succeed and enjoy this games even more once it reached its full potential.
---
Anyways, I just wanted to congratulate you and thank you for everything you've done. The community is lucky to have you!
---
Keep up the good work.
---
Cant tell if sarcasm
---
Yeah, I think that would be a pretty cool and thrilling idea, but not sure how it would actually play out. Being inside a vault would remove a lot of the flexibility of a BR game, like choosing where to drop and being able to explore anywhere for loot. It would have to be very linear, even with open atriums and what not, and I'm not sure how well that would work with a BR
---
The first sentence is, second is not.
---
LMFAO I love that your character has a frowny sad face as he salutes.
---
Not my proudest fap
---
They are satire but often speak the truth
---
I don't know but I really hope it comes out of the crashed space station.
---
It looks like a twin experiment fine wrong.
---
Extremely excited for Wastelanders. NW looks like it could be a fun diversion, but if it ends up full of toxic little kids I‚Äôll avoid it completely.
---
All those stretchy bois at Whitesprings mutated into something truly terrifying, and that's what we got.
---
I'm sceptical. How much of the stuff will be in the atom shop? Will they make Pay2win companions?
---
Companion + Excavator w/ 2 Cal Shocks.
---
Really hope this is allowed.
---
His videos tend to the positive when it comes to Fallout 76.
---
Given that depending on the time of day I play it appears I'm put on servers that aren't even based in the same hemisphere I'm in, I'm not that confident on playing a mode that will throw latency and hit registration issues to the fore.
---
It MIGHT be rewarding, we don't really know yet. I have doubts it'll even function very well given the engine it's on. Hell, the engine barely functions properly on it's base mode with 24 players or so, let alone 52 plus all the mechanics that goes into a BR mode.
---
I'm in agreement with the "contrarian dick" - I'm probably going to ignore it because I'm not interested in BR's anymore, the markets so over saturated that it makes my brain hurt and I don't think it'll work that well with this game.
---
People seem to be forgetting that people bought Fallout 76 because they were fans of Fallout, and what we got was a pretty broken base game, in which they are fixing, but it's baffling that they're allocating time and resources to a... battle royale mode... that no one really asked for...
---
Hopefully it‚Äôs not a tse shitshow lol
---
Free
---
Where IS that farm anyway? I swear in 600 hours I haven't seen that place yet.
---
Uhh, bloodied power attack damage and resistance isn't god-tier? A proper bloodied build with adrenal reaction and nerd rage will be doing exponentially more damage than an instigating one without the low health setup. With the low health setup, the instigating is at a massive disadvantage because it does something like 5% more damage on the first hit and then 50% less for every following hit
---
Pretty sure the scorch beasts fkd them up
---
"Copilot Music + Sound, Spank" on Spotify! They're the geniuses behind the Nuka World theme as well. Sadly, their Country Roads cover is exclusive (for now) to Apple Music.
---
YAHAHOOOO! HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY JOY JOY JOY!!!
---
I refuse to set foot in fallout royale.   I‚Äôll help out in the actual game,  I won‚Äôt give that thing any play time.  Let it die.
---
Just did it last week it was a fun challenge
---
Wow, thank you! I love to see YouTubers who know how to lay things out well, definitely earned a sub!
---
Please don‚Äôt
---
Uuhm random drop or buy it from someone . Just seen a lot of ppl acting like those other survival weapons was rare , they had a name sure but nothing else special
---
Guess I chose a good time to open up my shop, what with the influx of new players soon to come
---
Not going to lie. Talking to my friends and other players was cool. This community pretty much is the best. The one thing though that has always irked me is that it was ME playing the game. Not me playing my character. Now I get to do that and I hope to god it's full assed. Also, Raider scum. Your ass is mine.
---
well there is for sure a downvote bot for this sub so I wouldn't doubt it
---
Yeah you're not forced to play it but the original game could be better than it is now if they hadn't wasted time on this so we OG players are still losing a little
---
so now all those people who said "bAh  It'S sTuPiD no nPC's!" Can come play right?
---
Real question, why is there only one quest in the ever upwards content.
---
I dont think it will ever get to that with 76.
---
I bought save the world just a few weeks before they went full BR. I'm still fucking salty.
---
That's what I'm saying. They could have spent time making better shit for base game but they made this
---
They've been in workshops but were removed from CAMP.
---
The workshop one is still broken - place one, log out, log back in. You'll log back in at the mat location...... Meaning you can teleport into the Munitions Depot, etc, without owning it.
---
I think it was Charleston that still has the glitch where if you place the mat on the southeast..... You'll catch players trying to fast travel to the buildings nearby.
---
TL;DR not new, still broken since BETA
---
Don‚Äôt forget battle Royale will be added but other stuff like pve content will be added just like wild Appalachia
---
I like that there are no negative consequences for your Adventure Mode character and that everybody starts each session on a level playing field. With those things in mind it‚Äôll at least be worth a try as a fun diversion.
---
We all have to step away from time to time, hell its healthy.  
---
I personally had to take an extended break from Modding for Fallout4 and I have some fairly angry people waiting for me to come back, but the break and change to '76 was required for mental and physical health reasons.  
---
Enjoy a chance of pace, and when your ready give it another go.  
---
Personally all id ask (and it's hubris of me to do so, I admit it) if you still see issues that grind your gears make sure to take the time to report them.   
---
You'd be shocked how many small things I talked to the Dev's about they had no clue was an issue.  
---
**Things I hadn't reported because I assumed they knew already!**
---
It's not about them ignoring us or doing a bad job, it's about the magnitude of the game and the fact we all take for granted that someone else will report the problem.
---
*Appalachia radio stops*
---
Poor legendaries, like the one listed, I trade in for script.  I only put up the good ones.  To be considered good, they must have at least two good modifiers.
---
I sell legendaries at about 100 per star \[PS4\].  I'd rather see them get a good new home and I have plenty of caps.  Plus, if you come all of the way out to the Mire to my store, you deserve a bit of a break on nice weapons.  You might even find some plans that you don't have.
---
Who gives a crap about a bunch of whiney gamers. If you enjoy it they can suck the llamas ass üëå
---
Pretty sure this particular weapon was just introduced.  I know bloodied deathclaw gauntlet exists but now everyone can get the unstoppable monster by a small set of challenges.
---
To me... it feels like they've added a bit more to Survival mode is all an made it a map that will shrink due to the Storms and Nukes. Sounds like a cool FREE option to me and if I don't want to play that mode, then I don't have to play that mode.
---
Okay so... I bought FO76 at launch. I actually got the version with the helmet because I love Fallout.
---
I played the beta and it was... Eh. It was fine, but not quite the Fallout I know.
---
So I actually never played the game. It's been on my shelf since launch.
---
So... Should I wait until this comes out to start? I'm not in any hurry. Is there a reason to get some playtime in before they add NPCs and stuff? I believe they've recently made it so nobody can kill you online if you don't want, right? That's a great step forward for me, and I almost started it when I heard that.
---
I sure as fuck hope so. It would be awesome parts "I told you so" and "See the game wasn't that bad in the first place."
---
A lot of people do lmao, just read some of the other comments.
---
*shrug*.   
---
Won't be for everyone, but I found it an enjoyable change of pace that still felt like Fallout.   
---
That said, I'm excited as hell for Wastelanders, but freaking want the hundreds and hundreds of outstanding issues resolved before then FFS
---
Yea but I really hope there are some rewards you know like let‚Äôs say I get in the top 3 I should get a random legendary like if your in 3rd place you get a 1 star,if your in 2nd a 2 start and 1st a 3 star.You know what I mean I want some reward that makes me strive to win
---
Lol you had your head in the sand since day one lil fella?
---
I think you guys are thinking of the election event that was either cut or will be released later
---
They can‚Äôt afford the Johnny Cash version.
---
There‚Äôs the ‚Äúlmao‚Äù I predicted. Once the ‚Äúlmao‚Äù start you know the person is heated and salty
---
Neither of those games explicitly stated that no one ever goes to Appalachia. There's nothing to retcon - it just wasn't mentioned in those games.
---
Pretty sure they exist with those same effects
---
where can we get that?
---
Run AWOL and you'll find something that's the equivalent. Calling it god tier somehow suggests it is inaccessible and/or outperforms gear people can earn. That's how we get posts with people claiming PVP is now "ruined".
---
It doesn't. It's a _good_ legendary on par with other good legendary weapons. DPS and only counting one single melee power attack isn't even a decent way to weight meta in the face of Blocker, etc.
---
Schlong
---
ur character build is actually me
---
It is ‚Äúcool‚Äù to hate Fallout 76 and Nuclear Winter. It doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with the reality of the gameplay. I‚Äôll bet most people who hate it haven‚Äôt even tried it or would be biased if they did!
---
Yeah, I have a welcome mat outside my door. Sure seems like a logical spot to drop a player that comes to C.A.M.P if you ask me, not stuck in a floor I've placed.
---
I think we probably will. They‚Äôll just have no human settlements near fissure sights. Or they‚Äôll remove the nuking feature, though I think that‚Äôs very unlikely.
---
I dunno my over priced crap is selling fast than I'm able to squirrel caps in my Cayman accounts.
---
I'm talking only about the unstoppable monster and how it effects PvP, not any other weapon.  Finding another gauntlet with the same shit is hard, finishing the survival challenge will make it possible for everyone to melee it up
---
This hits me right in the jimmies in a good way. 10/10 can't wait to run the fuck away from this thing.
---
You do realize critters and dumbass super mutants visit and kill our dear Bessie right?!
---
Aaah ok , now i get your point üëç
---
I think it means a continuation of the "main quest" that involved the overseer. The current ending is a bit of a cliffhanger.
---
I just want my sentry bot companion back from fallout 4
---
No human NPCs was probably an experimental thing they wanted to try, but weren't married to if the fan feedback wasn't hot. It really does contribute to an atmosphere that's unique from the other Fallouts, but I won't complain they didn't stick to it.
---
I hope that we're not forced to play the new Nuclear Winter Battle Royale mode, e.g. if gameplay-altering gear that carries over to adventure mode is locked behind it (like crafting plans for more powerful power armor, or CAMP buff items).
---
I live in New Zealand, and, aside from Fortnite, there are literally not enough players for the matchmaker in battle royale games - Black Ops 4, Battlefield V battle royale game modes are all dead in my region. It's going to be super annoying if the Nuclear Winter mode gives out, e.g. a repair field buildable or renewable adhesive generator for the CAMP, and know that I'll never be able to get it.
---
Well it proves Todd lied about the "vision"  of the game being that thered be no human NPCs. 
---
Or the idea that the game launched was the game intended.
---
I've got 853 hours lol. Lots of exploring, playing with randos, playing with my brother, building CAMPs.
---
It looks sort of like a ghoul to me....
---
Maybe a ghoul-gaster?
---
I'm pretty sure Freddy went to vault76(?)
---
I mean, it certainly is a possibility.
---
I found a bloodied powerfist the day before and thought I was the shit in the melee world.  The next day I found about the unstoppable monster and now I feel less op.
---
Isn't Vault 79 down in the Ash Heap or whatever that place is called? Also: I feel certain that the Crashed Space Station will lead directly to Vault 79, or at the least have a massive part of the quest. I think it'd be cool to have Miss Nanny come back and she comes up to you, saying she got a radio signal from somewhere that was similar to Freddy's when he was taken, or whatever (Bethesda could make it work).
---
So god-tier has to be inaccessible? How does that make any sense? I consider god-tier to be the absolute best within its category. The fact that everybody can get this doesn't change the fact that it's among the best possible legendary combinations, and for most people is probably the best melee weapon they will ever get their hands on. That was the whole point of OP's post and my comment
---
If Bethesda put that on a shirt in their store I'd buy the shit out of it lol.
---
Not really. We begged for it repeatedly since release, and the game had a poor start, so they‚Äôre probably doing everything they can to keep it going. Adding NPCs despite not wanting them is just part of appealing to what little player base they have.
---
Did they announce the actual time when it goes free? In Europe it's been June 10th for awhile already, so it's kinda hard to predict.
---
I just hope that vaultsuit is something we can have in the base game. I was born to wear that number lol.
---
Oh dear OP. So many people think they are the whole community and its only their ideas that will help this game. And here we have you, just being honest about own impressions and feelings, without claiming that they are the only valid ones. Have my respect.
---
Buffout and psycho reduce strength by 1 each. Alcohol is -1 charisma and I think -1 endurance or perception or something. I can't remember the rest sadly, I recently took an addictol for the possum challenge
---
Unless Centaurs are returning
---
They announced a bunch of new games and gave more info, including release dates, on the ones already announced... they can't drop a new Fallout or Elder Scrolls on us every E3, but it doesn't mean they shouldn't skip it completely.
---
What's this about a fake clip lol
---
It‚Äôs just a game mode. Don‚Äôt play it. The game isn‚Äôt going to suddenly become exclusively BR.
---
No the overseer died in watoga as the mayor next to the robot
---
Why wait? You're going to probably want to be leveled for any new content drop. And yes, in Adventure mode nobody can damage or your camp if you don't flag yourself for PvP.
---
Serendipity doesn‚Äôt work in PA, I‚Äôd recommend getting gun smith over portable power and power user, cores last forever if you don‚Äôt vats and you shouldn‚Äôt vats with a heavy gun.  Get blocker instead of the sprint perk in strength.  Split up tenderize and suppressor up 1/2 or vice versa. I personally don‚Äôt like ricochet, if you‚Äôre not going Mutation build I‚Äôd recommend the repair gun perk in luck instead.
---
&gt;I'd still love Bethesda to comment and back me up, as I am out on a limb..
---
They did :) Maybe it doesn't show on your mobile app? If that's the case:

---
I haven't ran any mods or anything and this was the only time I've ever seen this, it's weird but I don't care enough to look into getting it fixed.
---
A player with a Bounty is FREE game, I don't take the junk, but I don't think twice about that type of action. It's not like I'm going out and picking on a player that doesn't have a bounty on them.
---
more like bore ragnarok
---
It looks like a new type of centaur. Centaurs were like a jumbled mixture of human and animal parts in FO3. They worked with Super Mutants. Their weakness was that they were slow. These new ones look fast.
---
This is not correct.
---
You read the whole post, right? Or was it one sentence? Was that one sentence god tier? :(
---
If you're playing fo76 and above level 50 _and_ the best melee weapon you can get for any scenario that you can obtain is Unstoppable Beast .......
---
..... leave the Forest Zone.
---
I did the same thing, it was hidden in a little clearing in the trees. But then a scorchbeast spawned there and kept killing me and destroying my camp. I tried logging out but it kept coming back, haha.
---
I think he should be the voice of one of our new characters in the NPC.
---
The conversation with the robot was definately the overseers voice
---
Yknow what? Screw the Mothman and the Interloper, I'm worshipping this guy.
---
Well said and hopefully someone from Bethesda will stop in and read this.  
---
I mentioned it above, and it's not smoke and mirrors, the Dev's were nervous in a way I don't think could be faked, it's was too spontaneous, I can't describe it any other way.   
---
Just a guess, but in part because we had been respectful but **brutal** the whole time leading up to the PlayTest.
---
Seeing that really forced me to adjust me perspective.   
---
I'm not going to let up on the bugs, and I'm not going to let them snow me, but I am a little more understanding of the frustration involved with getting even small things fixed.  
---
That said, I've personally "bet my job" more than once by shortcutting the red tape and just fracking implementing the fix.   
---
I'd really like to see someone do that ;)
---
I agree! I play games to get away from the real world. I feel like most people would prefer to leave politics out of it.... Bethesda can't afford to lose any more popularity in FO76 for sure.
---
Responder here. I am going to be giving out Stimpacks like candy on Halloween. Ammo? I got you fam. Upgrade your armor? No worries. Need a bro to show the ropes? I'll try not to get you killed.
---
nice! :D
---
The fact that the other commenters are defending them. Sorry dawg. The companies should find a balance between pleasing the true fans and making money. Not what they are doing, which is making shit decisions and expecting us to buy it anyway. They think it can't be different and we should just blindly accept it and use a subpar product that doesn't line up with what we want for entertainment.
---
Fallout 3 made me love this franchise. New Vegas is still the best of them all. 4 was enchanting and bewildering while it had its own problems. And this game was supposed to be as great as any other fallout game but you can play with friends. Instead we get a buggy beta quality game with the same glitches copied and pasted from 4 and survival mechanics that are more of a chore and a headache than a fun feature. Mtx makes every dlc free but the stuff you can buy is wacky costume stuff. It's like they lost their humanity and became moneybots. Maybe this will change in the Fall update, but I don't know if I trust them to make good decisions anymore
---
No?? She was attacked by Mole Miners and almost killed but survived that.
---
Possibly the same voice actor...? You know the voice actor for Nick Valentine was also in Skyrim. Think that means Nick was in Skyrim too? Or they use the same actors sometimes?
---
Of course it looks fuckin' rad, it's a trailer. That's what it's supposed to do.
---
Shit oh dear, I would have thought this fanbase would have learned to not get hyped pre-release by now.
---
I really don‚Äôt think Bethesda would stoop to the level to just rename these things ‚Äúcentaurs‚Äù
---
I apologize your right Elizabeth waters or something
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/ColorfulTriumphantNightingaleCorgiDerp
---
the voice is fake, it comes from the beginning of [this trailer](https://youtu.be/NhfYB0xaJvE)
---
In that case it's un unfortunately damaged file. Just do a quick Scan and Repair and it'll likely be fixed.
---
Man, I actually love The Overseer (is it weird since so far it's just a voice?) and hearing that cliff hanger, seeing... man. I'm super excited to see where this goes.
---
It does work... it just looks stupid being on the inside.  But maybe it was intended to be a dual keypad entry
---
Remember these servers won't have to deal with as much player inventory and player stashes and stuff like that
---
I wonder if the human NPCs will be billable or invincible and if they are billable if they respawn or someone else takes their place. I can just imagine some people running around shooting all the human NPCs.
---
It‚Äôs on par with battlefield firestorm. It‚Äôs the grown up version of fortnite and it looks fun as FUCK
---
Here come the lore-obsessives comeplain-posts. 
---
I for one welcome nice things
---
You're telling me I can open a bar in the middle of the battlefield?
---
Night Crawlers!!
---
True!!!ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
yes
---
I wish it replaced some of their lines too.
---
For instance:
---
Scorched: "Not...us!"
---
Todded: "Not...Skyrim!"
---
Battle royal is also coming, so that will be an additional update
---
Thank you.  
---
Won't claim responsibility for much beyond being a thorn in Bethesda's paw, and a very very minor one at that, but I'm trying to do my part. 
---
 Time will tell, but I know the Dev's, Community Managers and others do read this and the other subs, but I think due to how toxic we can sometimes be, it's not something done by everyone every day
---
Huh?
---
Definitely a new variant of Centaur if you ask me, I wonder if they came from the Capitol Wastes?
---
Thank you
---
Would be awesome,'especially if it was dynamic, reporting X was taken and Y is now up for grabs!
---
Good
---
Yes they‚Äôre cool but living dogs are just the best. Go dogmeat!
---
Badass. Thanks homie
---
I have a ton of charisma since I mainly play with my BF and it has a ton of perks for teams. Like healing people with alcohol
---
I think the 10th but it‚Äôll most likely be free for a limited time. (Correct if I‚Äôm wrong)
---
There's no such thing as best for any scenario...are you replying to the right person? None of that really makes sense in the context of my comment
---
Steam version will probably just launch the Bethesda Launcher, like Ubisoft games launching UPlay
---
Still a better love story than Twilight.
---
I wonder if we'll see buildings actually being rebuilt by settlers, what kind of permanent consequences our choices will have and if it's game/server wide changes or just for your character.
---
Looks like they accidentally posted it early, it either starts tomorrow or Wednesday after the E3 showroom closes.
---
They refer to it as a pre-beta in the article on the website. I‚Äôm guessing it goes for a week during the free trial window, then becomes an official beta after that.
---
There's a sneak peek tomorrow, looks like it might be fully released later on in the month.
---
What are you talking about? This is obviously a feral ghoul, he's just wearing robot armor.
---
Very interesting. I run an unyielding set up so I use a couple of the same cards as you and I felt like the berserkers weapons didn‚Äôt really do much difference when I was in a hazmat suit. Now I know why!
---
The current lore is she is still alive, because she leaves a holotape berating you for launching a nuke after you leave a silo.
---
Thanks, and apologies for the dumb question, but can I make a decent base without spending too much in the atomic shop?
---
That is always the best way to report cheaters or exploit abusers.
---
Uh I think you're in the wrong community
---
Well the first time they actually fix thing. So why not?
---
A while back someone on this sub made a Junkie guide with all that info and then some. Really informative if you want to learn more about Junkie builds. I think it was something like Yeb's Junkie Guide.
---
And shitty plans that everyone already has
---
Yeah i missed that one....thats what you get for running through the story.
---
I really am replying to the right person.
---
God tier suggests it is entirely unbeatable. This weapon is not. You are using the wrong terminology and have found yourself wildly confused because of it.
---
This is a _good_ legendary. Unbeatable in the majority of competent matchups _**it is not**_.
---
It'll start tomorrow since they said the promo will be all this week. It'd be weird if they started it in the middle of the week lol
---
I'd love to see a clearer picture of it later on. Looks like it could be an excavator prototype
---
Oh god, that looks like a heavily modified ultracite armor. I thought it was ultracite until I saw the helmet. Yeah I'm definitely excited for more power armor now!
---
A "Pride Month" isn't inclusion, it's pure pandering. Corporations use it to try increasing profits for the month. None of it is genuine, and none of it really matters. All that SHOULD matter is that just about everyone is fine with LGBT people and tend to treat them with the same respect as anyone else. Everyone has the same rights, we are all equal in the U.S.
---
I‚Äôd be happy with a rebar club.
---
It's definitely not just you. I've turned off the radio in 76 in large part because there's no "soul" to it now, with DJ... However, I also dislike all the missing songs, too. I think FO4 had the perfect play list (though I didn't like the new stuff they recorded, but that's just me), and there were a number of great tracks that we lost from it. I also disliked The Beach Boys being added as I fee it's just too new.
---
That being said... my vote is for Grahm as DJ :D  
---
Actually, I had someone else in mind a couple weeks ago, but I can't remember who it was now...
---
Like a playable sneak peak, or a trailer pt2
---
I really thought this fanbase would have learned by now not to get overly excited about announcements and trailers.
---
But npcs already exist.  Branching dialogue, consequences, and companions are a plus though
---
I main a heavy gunner and power patcher isn‚Äôt needed. I repair my pa once a month if that.  Grab one gun army in luck.  Power user is also not needed as cores drain very slowly unless your using vats.  The point return on anything beyond one point in tenderizer isn‚Äôt worth it.
---
It's the massive amounts of simpletons shaped by trash the likes of yongnah &amp; co.
---
Hilariously enough, those are all empty words since pretty much all of them have no idea what the fuck they're on about, it's just parroting.
---
This has happened to me a few times now. just got stiffed by a 3 star MLQ.
---
*Congratulations, you played yourself*.
---
I loved the perforator from the pitt
---
You may be high but you're still spot on. I'm curious to see if the settlers cause any,permanent changes to the destruction around them, like actually rebuilding towns, getting factories/mines/train stations/etc running again.
---
Really appreciate this. I'll be using this as a good guide on my farming runs.
---
Pretty sure it was about 70gb when I deleted it the other day.    I don't play it on my ps4 anymore, just my PC and wanted the room for Borderlands 2
---
This looks like the dialogue system from new Vegas and fallout 3. Which is good. I prefer it FAR more than the fallout 4 system or the  complete omission in 76. This whole DLC looks like the start of the back to form fallout in some ways.
---
I've had my camp up by there since the beginning, knew it would pay off eventually
---
right!? so many people wrote this game off as a 1/10 and threw so much hate. When at worst it was like a 5/10 not terrible, but not fallout 5.
---
I honestly think the gaming community just still had their pitch forks handy after diablo: mobile and threw their hate at the next time to even remotely screw up.
---
undoubtedly
---
No one forces you to do survival, I have not done it at all as have many. Rewards are in the eye if the beholder grasshopper. üòÑ
---
I‚Äôm against whatever is not thematic to a post apocalyptic world, the Christmas decorations, fruit hats, childish skins for weapons and all that bullshit
---
Stealth Archer 76
---
Really? That's upsetting, they are actually gating content by forced play of a PvP game mode? 
---
The stuff I saw mentioned these kind of rewards were strictly for the battle royal mode so hopefully it won't impact the core playerbase too much.
---
Trying joining on the main menu.  They you can load in together
---
I'm not confused by terminology, I'm confused to you referring to things that don't exist. 
---
&gt; You read the whole post, right? Or was it one sentence? Was that one sentence god tier? :(
---
this doesn't even look like it's addressed to me
---
then bringing up "best melee weapon for any scenario" out of nowhere, which is not a possibility in this game. Nothing is perfect, nothing is best for any scenarios, nothing is "entirely unbeatable". But this is among the best.
---
The crossbow deserves so much more ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Tip: If it's invisible it's impossible to kill. I usually sacrifice myself as a 3x conduit running around like a chicken with my head cut off so everyone can get their bullets in.
---
Idiots*
---
anyone who knows how the games industry works was fully aware that anthem was going to be a hilarious failure, ranging from a complete lack of basic information about gameplay and rewards structure for YEARS into development (already a big red flag), to simple facts like bioware having utterly no idea how to make a shooter, and especially not a looter shooter.
---
That backed with the ignorants at EA who gobbled up biowares lies like morons was a perfect recipe for disaster.
---
F76 is made by people who know what it is, what it can be, and how to get it there.
---
Not even close to comparable.
---
Holy shit man! Super proud of ya haha Way to go! Also, equal pride and congrats to those 7 other unsung heroes!  
---
Thank **all** of you for being our voice!
---
But also thank you to Bethesda for taking such a massive risk in these folks, but just as well, for hearing them out.
---
Only settlers and raiders as factions? So I‚Äôm basically forced to either be a junkie or a peasant.
---
Big oof mate :(
---
I think now is a good time to start an alt character and blend in with em to show them the ropes.
---
Tin can man wanna burn? Naaawh, we gonna cook you, like can of popcorn. Prepare for war, just few months!
---
Ppl are dicks, ignore them.
---
GTA...?!?
---
Bloodied is really not a good idea for an event where there's tons of max level gutsies, exploding eyebots, and an invisible boss robot that can take out 60% of your hp in one swipe
---
If you use an existing character, do you keep all your special points? I haven't seen this question answered.
---
Isn't that only the atom shop item at camps?
---
It seems you are the last to die. Try not to bleed too much on our new overseer.
---
[Yo what up.](https://media.giphy.com/media/xT1XGInOPaulnkdlD2/giphy.gif)
---
Not sure.  I was supposed to get some free original Fallout games because I survived the first couple days.  They never made it easy to find out how to claim the prize though.  So I never got the "free" apology handout.  Like waiting for that perfect roll/drop in RNG.  Promises, promises.
---
That‚Äôs what I thought at first, but it sort of looks like heavily modified combat armor
---
I watched the Game Spot stream and all the talking heads did was shit on this game and what they announced for it. I can't believe how disconnected they were from the game and still allowed to report on it. Obvious they hadn't played from launch. I am so excited for everything that was announced! Would never play a BR otherwise so looking forward to that but also so excited to see what the NPCs and new main quests bring.
---
Love how every YouTube comment is people saying Bethesda bought the audience and praising Cyber punk
---
They should only reference the bar special stat. Not multiply of each other
---
Then how can multiple Scorchbeast Queens be spawned in one server if the first and only one was canon? How can we renuke after using all 3 nukes? Its a game mode for the sake of fun just like how some things have to be done for fun.
---
Ffs
---
You are confused by terminology and you are confused by a very important sentence in the first reply.
---
If Unstoppable Beast is unbeatable (aka god tier) by similar weapons in every roll then you need to leave the Forest.
---
This implies that the "any scenario" point you are trying to make was already made..... and also implies that if you aren't getting some legendary rolls that can beat Unstoppable Beast then you are farming low level legendary equipment.
---
I'm sorry but you are confused.
---
I didn‚Äôt think of it being a form of ultracite that‚Äôs an interesting idea. To me it looked like heavily modified combat or marine armor. Or maybe a new kind of raider set.
---
I might spend most of my day giving purified water and corn soup to noobs.
---
 Also, i declare we have a 50% off plans sale!  Give em some good loot
---
I'm not sure. It says you can play this with a level 1 character and not be at a disadvantage to a higher level.
---
Nothing is bad in this game, you can play to the current end game with any build if it's done right. A few niche weapons like the crossbow are useless in most situations, but entire weapon classes as a whole each have some outstanding picks. Legendary effects have been adjusted (mostly nerfed) to be more on par with each other, the current meta is bloodied melee with unyielding armor to reach four-digit damage per hit.
---
The flat face and legs seem excavator, but the arms, light, and face hoses all seem ultracite. Chest I have no idea
---
Yeah and it gets pretty old hearing the same three "reasons" it sucks repeated ad nauseum. I don't know how people find the energy to devote time in their lives to interact with the communities of games they hate. Why not spend that time doing something fun or constructive?
---
Not the point.
---
The hero dont deserve but the hero we have.
---
Brilliant job by the 8 of you that were asked to go out there. It is very rare, CCP Games and Paradox being the only other two, maybe also Cd Project Red too. Obviously was a great trip.
---
Queue being obviously jealous but they chose the right people to do this.
---
I had a SBQ fight bug out yesterday, and got the sight change over to the companion command sight from the FO3 / 4. I you know, inspect, attack etc.
---
Didn't do anything though.
---
Add Blocker (STR perk) and Auto stim (or get better at judging health loss from pylons).
---
I used to get mad at this event because no one seemed to be helping but the above two tactics shifted to a lot less fails when playing with randoms.
---
You're applying a definition that does not exist. Nothing is unbeatable in any scenario. An item like that does not exist. So your personal classification of god-tier just means that the game has no god-tier items. I never brought that up, you just pulled it out of your ass. Downvoting every comment and trying (?) to form some insult about playing in the forest doesn't make you less wrong here
---
They said in the newsletter that when you join the mode you automatically get spawned in with the 51 Jumpsuit on, so I don‚Äôt know if we‚Äôll be able to get it in adventure mode
---
Thank ya, and if they wake up to check the thread expect downvotes haha
---
When does the trial start exactly? I told my friend about it and he said he cant find the option in the playstation store. Told him it might just be added later today.
---
Popcorn comes in cans?
---
did you get a canvas bag or a plastic one
---
Simulation Theory, just go wild with it.
---
Let's go! I have my for it too. PSN: Trinity1
---
Guy with a cowboy hat has a laser musket on his back (he‚Äôs in the right side of the photo)
---
Unless they are the early centaurs. I would rather it be a different creature too though.
---
thats why i have one as a pet he's a mean SOB
---
alright cool ima use sniper then I love using snipers thanks pal!
---
I do appreciate the bug roundups that you do and apologize if i come off a little harsh with some of my comments about what does and doesnt work anymore. this is an amazing story and i'm definitely jealous! oh if you need an updated version of xedit i can shoot something over to you. been working on building it out with as much information as i can get and hopefully itll be merged in soon
---
Alright im adding you
---
79 isnt in the game yet
---
Very cool! What an awesome opportunity. 
---
In the blog post, they say, "With the reduced map size...", are you able to say what area of the map this mode takes place in?
---
Ok and sorry i didnt know about the name thing. Its just he then went on to grief my one friend (somehow reinitiated pvp afterwords) and really messed up his base. I just wanted people to be in the know and who to look out for
---
I saw it on gamesradar saying itll start June 10th, hopefully midnight tonight
---
Welcome to the greasy, sweaty fold, brother.
---
But if you keep all your Specials, then it won't be an even field except maybe for high level players. My level 12 would have an advantage over a level 1 and a level 25 would have the advantage on me.
---
You're still confused. I'm not saying _that there is something is unbeatable in any scenario_.
---
Unstoppable Beast is very good but not unbeatable.
---
_God tier_ is a pretty specific term.
---
I'm not doing whatever you're accusing me of, so you can take your insecurity and deflection of Reddit mechanics elsewhere. I cannot, by myself, put your posts at -2..... That's not a thing and I would be quickly banned if I tried.
---
It‚Äôs gonna be out tomorrow in ‚Äúpre-beta‚Äù as they posted on twitter. I think it‚Äôs gonna be here for the duration of the free week, then it‚Äôll be removed until the official beta version launches
---
I think it's awful. I was seriously thinking about reinstalling FO76 when they talked about Wastelanders, and then they come out and say they added battle royale. What a joke. Who is their target audience at this point? Like who are they trying to win over to Fallout 76 with this? 
---
I don't think they are going to win over the battle royale crowd with this game, and there is absolutely no appeal to grand RPG players in a game mode like that. If somehow they do manage to attract the battle royale crowd it also means they take over and people who don't like that sort of thing get pushed out. 
---
This is just not a good move IMO. It just screams "We don't actually know who we're making this game for", when Bethesda had a very specific and very loyal audience for all of their titles who are getting thrown under the bus here like they are Diablo fans without phones.
---
RIP Bethesda zendesk tickets tomorrow morning
---
Probably came from Kentucky, Tennessee, or Ohio (I wouldn‚Äôt say any of the east coast like the Carolinas or Virginia, cause those are probably nuked to shit)
---
Bruh that's sick
---
All rifles can be a good choice
---
At a lower level semi auto may be a better choice as bullets are harder to come by.
---
I use a lever action for 95% of the time
---
I use an auto handmade against scorchbeasts
---
&amp; I use a gatlin gun against the queen.
---
But I am level 225 so all of those perks are maxed, I just swap depending on situation.
---
If you wanted to use only one gun, I would recommend a handmade in auto or semi auto as it can be used against any enemy , welcome back :)
---
I have only played 4, and will jump even during all the backlash this game got, only because i want to see whats its really like.
---
do mechanic/repair builds work in this game? I would love to open my own shop to repair peoples gear
---
I‚Äôve gotten word about a settlement that needs your help, I‚Äôve marked it on your map.
---
That‚Äôs how I see it as well. It‚Äôs basically a way to do PVP without getting frustrated and losing your stuff
---
this is what happens when he finally finds what he is looking for.
---
I give 0 fucks about karma lol.
---
If you want the reward then, yes you are forced to do survival. Nobody trades the survival items at a fair price.
---
What weapon would you consider to be God tier?
---
Same here. I don't care about Battle Royale, I didn't get Fallout 76 to play a fucking battle royale mode. There's already tons of other games out there for that, I don't need Fallout's take on the genre.
---
But I guess Bethesda really wants to stop Fallout from being Fallout ever since 4.
---
I've played with people who have done this when another random player was nearby and they wanted to invite them to join an event and/or a team.   
---
I think people who want to mess with you generally wouldn't invite you to a party. Possibly invite to a team, I suppose, but I haven't had that happen yet either
---
yes, your caps and levels go with your character to adventure mode
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/4f9q90xXpnRJ8vlIWVJxVK/fallout-76-nuclear-winter-is-coming
---
Makes sense, not sure why they posted it today though.
---
its currently past 1 am where I live so it will probably start sometime earlier in the morning today.
---
Same for me and my 19 team mates. We never get griefed and havent had a problem since release. His experience may be anecdotal but it is the far more common experience. Sorry someone hurt you.
---
You're going to get downvoted regardless because people are tired of this question.
---
Just play it. Especially now that it's free this week, there's no reason not to. No one knows but you if you're going to like it.
---
It absolutely does.
---
Plus I feel like it's actually smart to release games-as-a-service bare bones and vanilla. It's so much easier for the devs to balance things out and receive feedback from the community to figure out what people like/don't like in the game and slowly add in and balance that stuff. It's much better than releasing the game full of different modes and gameplay aspects only to have to remove some of those things when they learn the majority of people don't enjoy them. Then you have the other people pissed because they actually did enjoy whatever was removed and they quit playing.
---
TL;DR It's better to continually add to a bare bones game than remove things from a chaotic mess of a game.
---
Remember the old mirelurk kings? Very different.
---
Please do tell. I‚Äôd love to have a companion.
---
pc
---
If not, that jacket will be the first straight up paywalled content the game has released
---
Like a human Cerberus. 
---
Absolutely terrifying.
---
Thanks! I'll slide the PP points over to One Gun Army. Any suggestions on what to take with the 3 PU and 2 Tenderizer poitns?
---
Insanely excited. If it runs smooth awesome. If i win a game because 51 people dc, even better ;)
---
There isn't a named one that fits that description.
---
A Gauss rifle with instigating and VATS bonus _can_ out DPS Unstoppable Beast. An AA Minigun with FFR _can_ out DPS Unstoppable Beast. A Furious PowerFist with bonus power attack _can_ beat Unstoppable Beast. Those would be _peers_.
---
"Get Unstoppable Beast and win the game" is not true. Players should not be wary of a completely uneven matchup because they don't have Unstoppable Beast.
---
This isn't god tier. It's just good.
---
NPCs and real quests ? About fucking time !!
---
I might give FO76 another shot !!
---
People aren‚Äôt going to like it for the soul reason it reminds them of fortnite
---
you will need the bethesda launcher to play fallout 76, currently it is not on steam. &gt;!unless it did and i never knew!&lt;
---
&gt;Seems like it'll be riddled with bugs
---
It's bethesda.
---
I'll be really surprised the day they release something that isn't buggy as fuck
---
Snipers would just fall under the rifleman category, so you can end up using any non-automatic rifle. Definitely some great choices there
---
I am interested in playing, does anyone know what time the free trial starts tommorow. I downloaded the bethesda launcher and my only option to play at the moment is to buy the game. Does it start at midnight? or sometime tommorow during the day. Thanks.
---
Wastelanders hell yeah nuclear winter nope. Never really enjoyed these br games. But I do hope others try n enjoy it.
---
I personally feel it‚Äôs better than good because it‚Äôs not as rare as those, and I have a legitimate question for you, do you have to make your argument in a dickish way?  You just explained your POV very well and politely, but you were being an asshole to the guy earlier.
---
Im super mad I didn't come to reddit before spending 10 bucks. I read the article then went oh it says now so cool.
---
Ya I know, they said it was coming to steam in the future so I‚Äôm just waiting for that day it comes out 
---
Do you know where I can go to start playing the trial? On Bethesda.net it just says buy 50% off
---
Came here to say that. Jesus Beth
---
it may go on after the next update that will be later, monday morning
---
You need it but not in excess. It's too easy to end up carrying way too much. The only time I ever needed that much was to build my permanent camp. 
---
There'll still be times you'll run out of resources but those are situational, need to build a suit of power arnor. Need to build up your stock of specific ammo. Need to repair an item for a quest. But those are situational, in general always collect the rare stuff but you'll always be able to find steel. Wood too unless you're in the bog.
---
Thanks.  I went and looked it up for more clarification.  Seems they do not return any money but charge less as games get sold.  But they always charge.

"Normally, Valve takes around 30 percent of all game sales on Steam, with some exceptions for games from smaller developers in its Steam Direct program. That will remain the case for the first $10 million in sales a game maker or publisher earns. For all sales between $10 million and $50 million, the split goes to 25 percent. And for every sale after the initial $50 million, Steam will take just a 20 percent cut."

---
Eh, as long as theres still rewards for 2nd place idc. Im used to chokin at the end in most BRs anyway.
---
No I just bought the 10 dollar atom pack and only got 1100 atoms......feels bad should have waited but the article said now through the 8th.
---
Download the bethesda launcher... Then you can browse the games and im assuming on 76 it will give you the info you need.
---
Ok thank you! Right now is Monday morning for me lol so I guess I have to wait for the rest of the world to catch up
---
You are putting words in my mouth and then saying you never brought it up? I never said anything about unbeatable in any scenario. Those are ENTIRELY YOUR WORDS that I later addressed. I don't know if you're just a troll, but we clearly are not on the same wavelength. Have a good one mate
---
It's really good, sure. But this game is heavily RNG. We really can't say what is rare...... I have Gauntlets and Powerfists that are bloodied with SS and power attack. What makes this one unmatched?
---
I mean, did you read the other side? That person implied I wasn't competent enough to understand what conversation I was having.....
---
The thing about The Forest was meant to be a joke and not any form of insult.
---
20fps with abysmal aiming mechanics on consoles...  sounds pretty fucking rad lul
---
Ya I have the Bethesda launcher it just says if I want to buy it, I probably have to wait until the rest of the world gets to Monday which would be in about 3 hours
---
the game normally updates between 10 AM EST to 2PM EST
---
Yeah, popcorn comes in T-60 cans.
---
&gt;do you have a moment to talk about that juicy hellfire PA?
---
Well, I sir have a moment to! It did look very, very cool and different.  It's a completely new type correct, not just a skin? Do we have any clues to it's stats? It certainly looked cool as hell...very sleek
---
So say we all!
---
Oh ok thank you!
---
o god can the creator engine even handle the mode it can't even play there other shit games like skyrim and fall out right what makes you guys think it will hold 52 people
---
That's, again, where you are confused. The only mention of "unbeatable in any scenario" was in a purposely sarcastic comment about farming the Forest. You've latched to it literally. :(
---
Reread this when you are able. It will make more sense.
---
I‚Äôm honestly very excited for the future of this game.
---
I just love fallout so much, really cool to see it truly explored as an IP the way it has.
---
I‚Äôm indifferent. My husband looks interested. He can just play with my character. I‚Äôll try it out but I‚Äôm not bothered by it existing at all. If it gets my husband interested then that‚Äôs cool. I love the adventure mode. Maybe my husband can earn me some nice camp items or something.
---
There's the problem then...but that argument still doesn't make sense to me. A bloodied power fist can out-DPS a furious power fist, and a furious power fist can NOT out-DPS a bloodied deathclaw gauntlet. The gauss rifle makes no sense because it's a different weapon category. I want whatever this person's smoking to understand their idea of god-tier
---
It‚Äôs not that it‚Äôs unmatched, but the fact that you can get it with literally zero to no effort makes it miles better than the others. You can just sell them.  Or never buy them, because chances are you won‚Äôt get them out of the RNG.  It‚Äôs nice that you have those, but I‚Äôve played this game a decent amount and never pulled bloodied swing speed.  Pulled one bloodied power attack on a bad weapon.
---
I am so thrilled, I think I can finally actually love this game now, I had fun but with human NPCs man this is gonna be good.
---
It may not be till around 10 am East coast. Just a guess but that's about the time servers go down for anything update or maintenance it seems.
---
Try it out free for a week
---
This plus a live service game is always going to be released unfinished. Just look a both Destiny games at their release compared to where they end up: so many things are changed/added/balanced. You can't finish it until fans give you feedback on what works, what doesn't, what they want to see added to the game and the fans don't know any of that until they play it.
---
I imagine not many people will even bother with the free period.
---
I might be wrong but there was so much shit going on around this game that it's still a joke to many.
---
You‚Äôre right, iirc the free trial is 7 days.
---
Atoms
---
If the Amazon page you found it on says it has a disc then yea it'll come with a disk. And you should buy FO76 because it's a really fun game! Yea it has it's fair share of bugs, but you can work past them. Plus with the wastelanders doc that's coming soon NPC characters with dialogue choices are coming back and with it, a ton of new content! So yea $17 is a steal for FO76 at this point!
---
Yeah it‚Äôs kinda annoying about the challenges. It would be better if each mode had their own set of challenges separate from the other modes.
---
Oh alright thank you!
---
They already said players will launch nukes
---
How is that comment even remotely humorous
---
I have my share of Bloodied Rolling Pins and Gold Clubs......
---
RNG sucks. It probably takes less effort to finish AWOL. That quest (at least for me, says RNG) generally drops better quality items than wandering Whitespring.
---
But RNG - you're just as likely to get one walking the Flooded Train Yard.
---
Not really into battle royal games, but this might be a nice outlet for when I have an itch to do PVP but don't want to get too invested in it.
---
Kind of like the deathmatch rust servers, it was a fun break for 10 minutes every once in awhile after something frustrating happened in the main game.
---
8-10am est most likely
---
I want the human npc's to fall in love with me like in fo4
---
Is the BR mode going to continue to be free for people who own the game after the FTP week? Their wording on that makes me worry a little. I hope it's just that I have a cold and it's almost 2 AM and I'm reading too much into that.
---
&gt;Now lets see implementation and hope its a smooth process.
---
I'm going to be fairly realistic about that, I'm guessing there will be some growing pains, but damn, not only did nuclear winter look like something I might actually enjoy I was blown away by the teaser for wastelander. I thought at best we were going to get robot and/or animal companions...I didn't think they'd ever do full human NPCs, with dialog trees no less, within FO76. Wowza
---
Yeah I really like this idea, I fully expect this sort of thing to happen to be honest. Letting players play what they want is a good idea !
---
8-10am est probably
---
I seen boxing in a rink too lolol wondering how that week be implemented! Looks cool!
---
It looks seriously "beefy" compared to even Excavator, which itself is quite "husky" for PA...
---
Which given the fact we have "Light", "Sturdy" and "Heavy" armor classes... I can't help but wonder if we might get a "Heavy" class of PA?
---
I mean I admit how much of a long shot that is, but it's what comes to mind.  
---
That, or BoS got their hands of Excavator and gave it the "Ultracite" treatment.
---
Aren't they the same
---
Worth a look tho if your still up haha. The day i got it was maintenance day. The servers came back up not 10 mins before i finished download.
---
Oh and its 60ish GB. So... Be ready for that lol.
---
Yes its worth it.I spent $60 for the game and have gotten 200 hours out of it so far.
---
Eventually all those nukes gotta have some effect on the land.
---
And about the argument you constantly moved the goal post and called him confused repeatedly (Which if he was confused that‚Äôs totally understandable because of your argument). You came in with a completely locked mindset and said you‚Äôre wrong because of a standard I‚Äôm going to continuously change so I‚Äôm right. At least that‚Äôs how I saw it.
---
Well damn
---
it's doable, but you need to be the one in charge, take all those pylons and hide on top of the cabin, shoot her once and keep healing yourself, ppl can kill her, they just can't be organized enough to be the pylons
---
Big Boi
---
You can totally make a nice base without spending anything in the Atomic shop. And if there is something in there you like, it doesn't take long at all to save up Atomic points from doing in game challenges anyways!
---
I'm the opposite love pvp hate br but we are all different people who like different things
---
But did you hear New Vegas good?
---
No StArFeIlD aNd SkYrIm2
---
Or the chance to customize your companion.
---
I love this game but, Yeah, i wish they would focus more on stability first. So i don't get tamed animals spawning inside my house and can't get out. So i can actually build (or rebuild my house after pulling it apart to get animals out) without getting error messages telling me i can't build there despite it turning green saying i can. To spend good caps claiming a workshop, putting up resource extractors, generators to run them, turrets to protect them and losing the lot 20 minutes later after getting disconnected from the server. If this is happening now in straight adventure mode, i hope this battle royale mode has its own servers or we'll all be getting kicked off more often no matter which mode as the servers try to keep up.
---
Ya I‚Äôll check every hour or so
---
To bad they don‚Äôt let you download it before hand and just lock it until 10 because it will take me about an hour to download 60 GB lol
---
No problem man!
---
Small details. Commonwealth variant has visible shoulder padding, Appalachian does not. Commonwealth variant also has visible collar that is partially unzipped at all times.
---
Any tips for starting the game tomorrow?  I'm hoping my progress carries over to when I eventually buy the game.
---
Thank you for pushing on Bethesda to either open up or atleast have someone from the Community itself try and 'help' with making things easier for them. I don't like seeing Bethesda suffer for their incompetence nor do I want any  game to fail. But they simply needed someone to stand up and ask the hard questions about where this game is going and how the community can make things easier. Its clear that corporate BS sometimes gets in the way of things, but I'm glad to hear they're aware of it. Now, when they start showing some serious progress I'll have my faith restored in them but for now I'm still a little skeptical about the future of the game itself. NPC's coming in is great and I expected that, the BR mode I'm not happy about but for the sake of letting other people have some fun I'll keep my mouth shut on it.
---
My big guess is that we're going to get a 4th of July event. Heck maybe even the Presidents stuff that was datamined awhile back could show up around that time too. Also hyped to see the Plasma Caster is getting added in (end of the Wastelanders trailer) along with TNT (same trailer end). Maybe more Fallout 1 / 2 / New Vegas weapons being added will help.
---
Vault 76s population was preselected and the guards had orders to turn away anyone who was not in the list by force if needed. Whatever Vault her in isn't 76.
---
The closest Vault to his home is actually 51
---
Does the level 5 vault dweller have a gamma gun?
---
While I am looking forward to more players, I *really* hope they sort out some of the stability issues. Game rendering, invisible enemies, taking an age to open the pip-boy/map. 
---
I can't see any of these and many issues getting better with *more* stress on their servers. That is unless they are planning to address it. I've seen a lot from E3 about new stuff, not really a lot about plans to fix the problems and playing as much as I do, I see a *LOT* of bugs and such.
---
I really want to feel positive about all this but at the back of my mind I am being reminded that all of this new content is just going to add more bugs, more issues and far more strain on the already fragile servers.
---
Who knows, maybe beforehand they will bring in a magic patch that fixes everything.
---
We should have had npcs that you could actually interact with from the start with full dialogue options. It really does come off as pure laziness that they couldn't even make the robots like normal fallout 4 npcs and it would have made the game so much better. I am definitely excited they are finally making it a reality though, better late than never. Maybe someday we will even get text chat.
---
Me too! It is one of the coolest locales and things in the game, so it was such a big letdown that so little is there when you go explore it. And that it is so small in a lot of ways with nothing really lore heavy to dive into learning about. I hope it will get a lot of future use.
---
I‚Äôve done awol dude.  This was a billion times less effort. 1. I fast travelled to the Fair while I was starving and had two pieces of raw meat. 2. I load up survival.  3.  Kill ghouls with melee.  4.  Claim Dirt Track.  5.  Kill critter while I‚Äôm already starving. 6.  Eat raw meat. 7.   Drink beer and cook.  
---
It took me all of five minutes once I got on survival.
---
Unfortunate you saw it that way. I didn't feel I was moving goal posts.
---
A god tier weapon is something that will nearly always beat any other matchup and often is not accessible (think Bloodied Explosive Lasers after last patch).
---
Goal post set. As others in the same thread have said, not only is not unbeatable but it can be acquired without (an equivalent, that is) acquiring Unstoppable Beast.
---
I have no idea what this person's agenda is in trying to fault a challenge for making a _good_ legendary accessible by calling it "god tier" is.... As that is FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt).
---
I think if it was exclusive to this game mode it‚Äôs fine. This game mode isn‚Äôt supposed to be lore-friendly.
---
So am I, it really captures the post apocalyptic feeling by being so close to the Great War. Also, I mentioned it somewhere else in here, I think,it's actually better to release live service games fairly bare bones. It's easier for the devs to balance and add/change things as they receive player feedback. Imagine Destiny/Destiny 2 releasing with as much content as they have by the end of their life cycles but without any player feedback; it would be a nightmare trying to get everything changed and running optimally for player enjoyment. I can't wait to see what other stuff they add over the years.
---
It is some extra thicc power armor
---
do you have mechanic jumpsuit? the green one, I wanna roleplay as one this week
---
I feel like their HP total is a bug. Surely they weren't really supposed to be tankier than a Deathclaw. Either that or they were supposed to be a lot larger.
---
The only way you can permanently get rid of those bases is to delete everyone's base. Those bases are called "legacy" bases because you cant build them anymore and bethesda cant do anything about it sadly
---
Thats great news! I can grind the new mode then go through old content leveled a bit and with some caps! :)
---
It's odd how much he's lied about this game...seriously the fuck dude?
---
It's just that, I know the PC version is just a code. No disc
---
5 minutes x a billion is not the effort to finish AWOL. It's like 5 robots (with luck.... RNG).
---
There is nothing that beats everything!  God Tier is the best of its class or for a build. If something is mandatory for you to have for the build you run to be as good as it could possibly be, I‚Äôd classify it as one of several God Tier weapons.
---
Out of curiosity, how does the fact that they're human change anything? The novelty here is that we get dialogue trees and what seems to be a dynamic faction system. If all of the settlers and raiders were robots, the game would function identically. If Rose and Biv and all the other NPCs in the game were human, the game would function identically. Why is it the human part that people latch on to, then?
---
Looks like everyone will have base weapons you'll probably be OK! Your right though no reason not to play.
---
Ultracite excavator sounds badass. Looks badass too, if that's what it is
---
Settlers forever! Rebuild together.
---
It really doesn‚Äôt matter to me either way, but I see a lot of people excited about it.
---
Yes I believe I do
---
Pick up all the weapons and armor you can so you can scrap them to learn new mods
---
I think as long as it isn‚Äôt in any of the normal game modes it should be allowed. I‚Äôm sure at no point in the fallout canon there was a rectum of fire closing in on West Virginia, so therefore hellfire should be fine.
---
They said in the trailer "Year 2" so meaning a year after Vault 76 open.
---
I loled.
---
Almost certainly will be $15 Australian Dollars on the Aussie store. As the user above meant by 'AUD'.
---
That's one aspect about it that I like
---
Sorry, I gave you the incorrect number. Its just under 65GB. Something odd cause people to redownload the whole game in the day one patch. It didn't actually add to the original size.
---
As long as the armor is only in that game mode and not normal mode I‚Äôm fine with it.
---
There's a settings option which I believe is bugged. It turns off chat audio every time and I have to manually enable it again
---
At this rate they are going to add just about whatever the community wants to the game (assuming there are enough people asking).
---
I honestly respect it. They realized they messed up and are now trying to make things up to the community and fix the problems. Say what you want about Bethesda but when they really fuck up they listen and at least try to fix it.
---
I personally loathe Battle Royale, but I appreciate them listening to those who love it and will just avoid that particular mode.
---
Also Pete cant predict the future and cant even speak for the company as a whole(theres a lot he isnt told), so getting mad at him is silly.
---
If you wanna be mad, be mad that those who asked for it (though that would be a pretty waste of time if you ask me)
---
Plot Twist: The Forest is a spin off of Fallout
---
The title of the product should say something like code or digital if it isnt a disk, if not maybe look at the description of the product that should tell you. If there isnt any mention if a code or it being digital then its probably a physical copy
---
&gt;Edit: Oh and free trial this week?  Get ready for sever issues soon.
---
A server can have max 24 players. Doesn't matter if there is more or less players on other servers. No reason to believe it will affect server performances.
---
There isn't a requirement or guarantee to _beat everything_.
---
I can run the same build without Unstoppable Beast - even with the goal post moved the definition is the same. The base item can be different, the effects can be slightly different, and inevitably even the weapon type can be different.
---
To the point in the OP this doesn't ruin PVP in any way. It just guarantees people who use this are squishier because of bloodied.......
---
I really don‚Äôt care about it, I honestly wish they didn‚Äôt add them. The game doesn‚Äôt need them or a dialogue system, it was more about interacting with other people for me
---
&gt;I can already smell the hackers, this game has no anti cheat, this mode is going to be utter fucking hell.
---
The fact is we have no idea of what mechanics and failsafes have been built in. Keep in mind this has been in the works since before the launch of FO76. It sounds like they've done some interesting things, under the hood, with the engine. 
---
Do I think it's going to be spot on at release? Ummmm, no. It is still Bethesda! On the other hand they've gotten to be much better at doing hot fixes for critical fails and getting other major bugs fixed in the next half-patch. I am hopeful
---
Obvious exaggeration, but my apologies.  Getting Unstoppable Monster requires zero luck.  Zero RNG.  Zero effort.  Only one thing for you to actually fight is a handful of level 3 ghouls or something along those lines. Critters cannot Attack you back though.   
---
I‚Äôm finished arguing with you, you are not willing to rationally converse because you are unwilling to compromise a single bit.  
---
In closing:  God Tier (IMO) is best of its class.  Not the bs about unbeatable in every situation.  
---
Unstoppable monster a rung below God Tier but above very good due to the fact it is guaranteed, great collection of effects, on a popular weapon, and better than most unarmed weapons in its class. Oh and it‚Äôs free.
---
What id like to know is how/where I get this free week, I know its quite a download and would like to start it before I sleep if I can.
---
all of it, literally basically just the flag is post war
---
You have to be completely clueless to think that Bethesda didn't have most of this planned.  Obviously, the immediate blowback surprised a lot of us including them.  There were web articles and you tube videos being made about the negativity towards this game for months after release.  Not that they weren't deserved, but we are all still reading and commenting on a subreddit about this game.  We all still cared enough to stay that interested.  It has improved 10 fold since launch. "Roadmaps" for games take years of planning, and this wasn't a spur of the moment fix.  They knew there would be issues and they rolled with the punches.  I've been here since beta and I will be here till the end.  Happy scrapping fellow wastelanders.
---
On the fallout site it says you cannot use VATS on other players in BR. I do see your point though. SBQ gets laggy...
---
It's quite simple to me: if it turns out to be fun and playable, then I will play it.
---
I don't care if it's battle royale and many battle royale games have existed these kinda things or if this is or not "Fallout".
---
I‚Äôm not likely the line ‚Äúincrease your overseer tank to gain rewards‚Äù I don‚Äôt want to speculate, but it‚Äôs possible Bethesda implements a buyable  XP multiple similar to Fortnite to get access to the ‚ÄúOverseer Rewards‚Äù faster. This wouldn‚Äôt be all that bad for skins or other cosmetic items; however the ‚Äúsemantics‚Äù  are worrisome. Hopefully there is no items or exclusive rewards that are usable only by playing this BR mode, in which paying to level up faster allows advantage.
---
Absolutly not!
---
This wiki seems to have a fairly complete list:
---
 [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Addiction](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Addiction)
---
Look.
---
There are only 4 options shown that is the same as 4, given though two of them ARE stat based. However this is only one example we‚Äôve seen so I‚Äôm not jumping to conclusions but I‚Äôm also super cautious and don‚Äôt want to get my hopes up.
---
What DOES get my hopes up is the changes to the game world and where this could possibly go.
---
Will they do Year 3 based on how many people side with raiders or settlers?
---
Will we have options to do truly evil things like attack both sides? Will we have the option to try and broker peace between the two?
---
It makes me optimistic. But I‚Äôve been heartbroken before so I must temper my hopes.
---
Definitely not in it's base form.  God no.  GTA online is awful.  Modded gta rp servers look good but regular online is a goddamn mess of screeching 12 year olds.
---
For quite a while I was wearing the enclave uniform and skull mask looks super creepy with the pip boy light in photo mode
---
you! you came to my camp in survival mode this week and killed me!! and then the mothman showed up! and you bought one of my plans in the middle of our fight!!! and then i think i killed you everything was happening so fast...
---
No, I get it.
---
You both were very fixed on making clear that this was "god tier" and inventing a requirement that it had to be superior in every scenario without compromise.
---
gg hf
---
They could have multiple companions with different stories and possibly allow randomized appearances for every different instance.
---
So you get a base of say, 10 companions with a pre determined set of stories like Piper, Valentine, or MacCready in FO4, only their faces are a mixed bag so every player's 'Piper' looks different, but has the same story.
---
Hm. I wonder if it depends on your camp location. I'd guess .38 might be more popular with lower to mid levels
---
Op wasn‚Äôt saying it would ruin PVP because it was sooo overpowered.  It‚Äôs a very good weapon in the right build, but it could ruin it because now anyone can very easily, very quickly, and very guaranteed can get a one shot weapon. It‚Äôs not only about how great it is, but how easy it is to get.
---
Oh shit. Time to get on itunes
---
No, thank everyone here for being a paid beta tester!
---
Dog collar is in the game, and it looks like FO4's dog armor, all raider-like.  It's classified as a helmet but you get an error if you try to wear it something like it isn't for you.  
---
So anyway, you're not far off.
---
Guys it‚Äôs a plasma caster
---
How is the Hellfire in the game?!
---
Also it‚Äôs the CC version :(
---
They'll likely add more in future DLC, plus raiders and settlers could be an umbrella term for multiple factions *of* raiders and settlers.
---
Where the fuck did I say it was God Tier?  I said it wasn‚Äôt but was damn close. Where did I create that scenario?  You did.  Foh dude.
---
Also depends on if they are stealthy.
---
I seen boxing and other activity's too BR might just be one of a few new activitys! The other dlcs added items to the atom shop so hopefully hellfire armor land there. lol also looks like you can launch a nuke and whipe out a piece of the map!
---
A one shot weapon at melee range on a bloodied build when VATS teleport falcon punches are a thing of the past......
---
Shift that goal post to toe-to-toe with a non-legendary tire iron.........
---
I can't help with your problem, but your character's fashion is outstanding
---
Awesome, really appreciate the help, thanks.
---
you can't possibly believe that item spawns and what not aren't going to be random.
---
Buddy, are you coherent?
---
If you swap out "god tier" with "very, very good" the terminology is changed but your intent is the same.
---
Bye, troll.
---
Its a stupid idea.  Maybe we should have a Kwanza Event too?  Fuck no
---
They said the nuke radius will be heavily reduced though
---
There I a super smal chance that the people who reas your post will ever see that person. However, there is a super huge chance that innocent players (not necessarily in this instance) can be suffering from a game bug and arent aware of it. They then get hate mail and ridicule for something they were not aware of. So its safest to have an all encompasing no identifiers on forum sites like this.
---
Thanks, that ... helped.
---
Preach!
---
NPCs, settlements, dialogue trees and skill/stat checks, factions to join and help, god yes.  This is what I wanted from the beginning!
---
Lol gotta launch it on the turret camps and sniper nests
---
Upvoted for visibility.
---
I‚Äôd rather they just publicly stated that the only PA that were present were the ones we‚Äôve seen, and that they are going to add more only to keep the game interesting and for players to get cool shit.
---
Otherwise where do the retcons end?
---
I don't know about that; it makes no sense to me to have crafting, repairing and harvesting cards equipped when you're not doing those things.
---
I'm probably in the very small minority, but I actually enjoyed fo76 at launch. I didn't really encounter too many bugs and ran into zero griefers. I enjoyed it because I got what I expected - a survival exploration game. One of the main reasons so many people hated 76 was because of expectations vs reality. Bethesda marketed this in a way that appealed to RPG lovers, but Fallout 76 is not for RPG fans. 
---
While I'm excited for the mode, I'm also fully prepared for a shitshow.
---
DLC what are you talking about DLC?
---
So they are bringing back both old dialogue and speech check beyond just Chrisma? Heck we could see a return of skills in Fallout 5.
---
I think it‚Äôs xo2 or 3
---
Bout to stack up on caps boy
---
Can you get incendiary gun in this game?
---
Probably won't know for sure for a few more months.
---
Almost looks like a proto-centaur.
---
Yes, but it will probably be blown up.
---
Depends what your PC is. I have had no issues from beta to now with performance.
---
3 levels of "can do" and spend 10 minutes searching trash cans will give you more non perishable food than you can carry.  I suggest white springs vendor area.
---
Yes for sure! I hardly run into server crashes anymore
---
It is cool though that it's not purely based on charisma. I like that there's a perception route also.
---
Finally, NPC's! I will reinstall when the update is released.
---
Came here to say this  
---
and I think this will work like the royal jelly spawn and so can be respawned with a friend- two hops and you have enough, 5 and you both do
---
The info they released said it'll be tied to V51 access so it could be depending on whats inside.
---
I remember a time when we each measured our games by how it made us feel not by someone else's preformed inflexible opinion, and we certainly didn't rely on aggregates scores of said opinions as the be all end all definitive word on a game. 
---
I can't tell you how to feel, just how I feel. I preordered and have been playing since day one of the B.E.T.A.. ZERO regrets! I've had and continue to have an engaging blast playing 76. I follow the hate on the YouTubes, Twitter and reddit but it in no way prevents me from enjoying myself or retroactively turns my past fun into misery.
---
I say if you enjoy playing the game listen respectfully to others opinions but your opinion is  infinitely more valuable in what you like to play.
---
So SMILE and head out into Appalachia and let the negative people miss out because they are too nit picky to just enjoy something.
---
Take it from an old lone wanderer
---
This still works.

They worded it confusingly. You keep specials but they don't *activate* in BR. No passive effects.
---
I'm sure my Gatling laser and I will have something to say before we're "popped".
---
You could always just try it out within the free trial week and if you enjoy it, buy it.
---
i don't care if robots die, I don't care if supermutants die. But hey, if Sally NPC needs something I'm gonna do it. It makes me feel more part of the story. It's hard to explain in text, but this 180 BGS is doing is fixing the game and bringing it to where it should have been by launch. I wish my friends would still play, all of them said skip it for a year and it'll be good, and they were right about the pvp and npcs .... but this BR shit makes me ill.
---
I took so much shit when I said there was definitely a battle royale coming..... I thought it was so obvious.
---
Pfft mods confirmed shillsü§îü§îüòí/s
---
OH GOD NO NO MORE SETTLEMENTS
---
The real questions you should be asking is whether they have added necessary quality of life improvements and patched game breaking bugs. Sadly the answer is no

As was said, the Scorchbeast Nests in Watoga have organs- the ones on top of Watoga Civic Center have always had meat for me.  
---
I have yet to test it, but think these nests will respawn for a player on entering the area like the royal jelly does. and with a friend you can sever hop to get 3 of them. At least I am hoping it does.
---
For real? I'm a PS4 player, so my biggest issue was the framerate, it constantly made me feel sick. What game breaking bugs are still affecting the game?
---
Sad
---
It's sad that people get misinformed like this but just check the game out. Repair kits are buried at the bottom of the atomic shop, stuff doesn't break any fast nor have food/drink requirements been increased.
---
Games super enjoyable and alot of stuff has change. Also starting tomorrow for a week it's free so you'll be joined by tons of new players.
---
I am more interested in eating corpses, than speaking. Not sure if i would listen to you and your pew pew gun.
---
I forgot one
---
Snappy McSnapface - Pro-Snap cam w/ 105mm
---
I figured it might have been typical misinformation, I'm thinking about giving this game another try. Free week looks like a good chance to jump back in.
---
I think we can expect options for each of the special stats depending on the goal of the conversation.
---
Agree, the biggest take away (IMHO) Bethesda needs learn from all of this is they need MUCH better community communications.  
---
Horrid analogy but...
---
Surprise parties are great, but if your spouse carries a gun maybe a bunch of people jumping out of hiding places and shouting is a bad idea..
---
By the time I'm through the only thing you'll taste is ash.
---
All that stuff would be really cool, and it feels like that's where things are heading.
---
I see that this example only has 4 options, but there's room in the UI for more than 4 options. If they were going to only have 4 options for each response, the box wouldn't be that big. It's possible that the extra room is for options that are longer than one line, but those types of responses aren't very common, and there's a lot of extra room here.
---
Was good while it lasted in guessing though you have had to have seen it coming I mean come on there's supposed to be vault raids in the future right?
---
we didn‚Äôt get one tonight but I expect we will get one sometime this week or next.
---
They did and if the NW camps are separate, it is not an issue.
---
That is good, so the online aspect is smoother now. Near launch I just credited it to the large amount of players, but maybe it had other issues.
---
It definitely depends on the build my current build finishes off at 68, some of my others were 100+ (using 2 weapon types)
---
I definitely think 76 should have been released with a little bit more meat and a few less bugs,  but yes I agree with this sentiment.
---
Ok good I was looking going surely I didn‚Äôt miss it
---
Battle Royal? Really?
---
available tomorrow. it means pre-beta for a week and then we gotta wait til it's released I don't know when
---
*nod*.  
---
Verified by the Reddit community, but it's lacking the "Bethesda Responded" that many people wait to see to verify a post isn't BS
---
800 hours in and it‚Äôs so far my favorite fallout so yeah gtfo
---
Battlestar galactica fan?
---
Or it's still not fixed and Bethesda deserves the goddamn criticism of fucking up this badly. FO76 was pure corporate greed of trying to produce the most minimal amount of content for the maximum amount of dollars possible, and it blew up in their face.
---
If you‚Äôve done the quest you can go to Ft Defiance and right before you enter the main door there‚Äôs a computer terminal on a post. Login with your military ID and plans will be right there.
---
Eve.
---
They‚Äôll have caps by the end of the week!
---
thanks!
---
Have you got AVG, or any other antivirus installed? If so, it may be quarantining some important files. Check the antivirus logs and if anything related to Fallout 76 is in there, restore it. 
---
I would recommend completely uninstalling the game, reboot, disable your AV, then reinstall. Then run the game, with your AV still disabled. If that works, it confirms the AV is the culprit, so you can either just uninstall the AV, or add an exception for fo76 related folders.
---
Oh shit I forgot what game we're talking about
---
And he‚Äôs here to do some business with a big iron on his hip
---
I agree.   
---
Because they are on the console platforms they do have some limitations (as I understand it they can't push updates as quickly) but I'd like to see quicker fixes for critical issues.
---
&gt; Wow what a read. I guess at least you get exactly what you deserve.
---
Right. Who wants fucking Battle Royal in fucking Fallout of all things?
---
It's bait, a lower level attacks &amp; then 1-3 higher levels ambush if you retaliate.
---
i honestly hope journalists and youtubers pick up your story and people can stop thinking bethesda hates their fanbase
---
There are repair kits in the atom shop, but they are not as good as the ones that drop in game. They are not super rare, expect 1 or 2 from SBQ. Id say its not at all a p2w feature. There are still bugs, and I do crash from time to time. Pvp has changed a lot, not much of it at all on adventure mode anymore. It does still go down at workshops. No more camp griefing, so you can now build a decent camp. Player vending rocks.Survival is pretty dead atm, the dupe waves kinda flooded the game with strong gear so meta builds/loadouts are forming. Melee still rocks, bloodied builds with stealth are killing it. And it seems now an explosive gatling plasma is an easy win. That being said the game is many many times better. It looks to be going in the right direction.
---
I think people are allowed to be pissed that this *wasn't* there from the beginning and now it's here after months of denial and some of the shit that Todd Howard has said.
---
I didn‚Äôt look forward to the battlefield Royale but it was surprising really good so I‚Äôm not going to complain until I play it
---
God man I hope so!
---
I actually came here from there to get some discussion on the new updates. One of the top posts for the day is about 76 getting a BR mode where the OP conveniently "forgot" to mention the Wastelanders update in any capacity. Those people really are looking to hate a game that seems like it's on the come up after a long time.
---
I agree completely , I think it will make the game feel more immersive and a little less lonely too honestly, if you ever get the chance to pass on the idea that'd be coolüòâ üòä The hosts from the previous games in the series were very memorable in my opinion , I find myself quoting three dog or Travis lonely miles on the reg. As weird as it sounds the hosts were probably one of my favourite parts of fallout in general. I'd love to play a quest about the Appalachian radio in FO76 or something too , they could really incorporate some great lore and story. I really Appreciate your write-up and work by the way mate ,well done üëç
---
It would be cool if I could import the hooker NPCs I made in FO4.
---
Excuse me, are you saying Rex isn't a good boy?  
---
Cease.
---
Why is no excited that they are adding hell fire power armor!?!?!?
---
I built my CAMP outside the door to Vault 51. Sad times.
---
Hopefully Bethesda will acknowledge tames and let us use our tamed creatures as companions. 
---
I miss Goris...
---
Console feels
---
Imagine if they didn't waste all that time on nuclear winter and we were getting a sneak peak and earlier launch of wastelanders next week. Man makes it even more depressing when I think of it that way.
---
Also dialogue trees are only good if there are consequences for your choices, I don't see how that could work in a multi player.
---
FINNALY SOMEONE SAID SOMETHING
---
I don't have the resipe yet how do you get it or find it?.
---
You're right, the article shows a June 10th post date, despite being posted. Also The Bethesda support page is freaking out right now lol; can't submit a ticket atm
---
The queen drops 2-3 improved repair kits, so higher levels essentially get free repairs. The atom store repair kits are just for people struggling through the levelling process.
---
As someone who uses the flamer quite regularly ammo isn't it's biggest problem. The biggest problem with the flamer is that it breaks way too quickly. It breaks roughly 4 times faster than my other weapons! 
---
Although admittedly lowering the consumption would fix both of our problems.
---
So your biggest gripe with the game was that you actually had to play it? Even if they changed that issue I don't think you would want to play it anyway with that mindset.
---
Sorry but I don't understand what you're saying.
---
15000 hah
---
Yeah I‚Äôm assuming there‚Äôll be maintenance at like 8am-9am central and we‚Äôll be able to play around  12-1pm central
---
As I mentioned (the post is a wall of text so easy to miss) the others requested to remain anonymous for a number of different reasons.  
---
I'm going to respect that, besides the fact they have the right to remain as such it would undermine my credibility if I " outted" them and be a jerk move.  
---
What I will say is the others involved represented important aspects of the community as a whole, think of each of us as a micro of the macro.  
---
I was the QA/Bug guy...  
---
But the community also has countless visual artists, "photographers" (and that is an art form in its own right) master settlement builders,
---
PVP Aces, Large scale "traders" etc etc.
---
It's free for the week just try it out. Unless you have really shitty internet than I feel yah.
---
My guess is that it will be a playable version of the Nuclear Winter game mode, without the vault story content.
---
Those bastards are the reason I carry an exterminators explosive .50 cal. Only thing I've found that makes then manageable.
---
They needed more time to figure out how to make it work with the backend.
---
Why? I don't understand the mindset of hating something just because it's popular.
---
Neat.
---
I agree completely , it just lacks what made the radio in fallout well... Radio in fallout and omg every time wouldn't it be nice comes on I lose it. It's a great song but it just doesn't fit in with fallout 76 , it's too refined and too happy and modern for the game , really destroys the immersion. Anyway I really hope they add radio Dj's I'm doubtful but at the same time I didn't think they'd be adding Human NPC's which I am over the moon about. Fingers crossed
---
yes, i would hate it^^
---
I mean you technically could do that but people would have to trust you with their gear. It doesn't take much material at all to repair your own stuff so either way I don't think this would be very successful. Good idea though.
---
Just downloaded it
---
I've had a love hate relationship like many others over this game but you know I gotta say Bethesda is definitely listening and doing what a lot of us want and I love that.
---
yes, i'm aware of it. it's just not working everytime.
---
The question is whether the game will acknowledge buffed stats for dialogue, or whether it will only register your base stats.
---
I assume they are going to have to push a patch before it starts since there will be a sneak peak at nuclear winter, keeping that in mind it will probably be live around noonish EST if I had to guess.
---
Thanks for taking the time!  
---
They have a plan.....    
---
Some of the original anger centering around the lack of NPC's was due to there being evidence in the game files THEY were in there...   
---
This matters because it supports the idea the addition of NPC's was part of a planned story arc and not a response to the outrage from us.   
---
But with that plan in mind they have been listening to our feedback, seeing where we spend our time in game and trying to accommodate our "asks"...
---
Stalker with American Bandanna, goggles and hat
---
Holy jesus they just keep taking this the wrong direction. That being said i cant wait to give it a whirl.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm cautiously optimistic in this case. Last thing I want is to be either Chaotic Evil or Lawfull Good. Hope they do this well or it will fuck up one of the things that I like most over FO4 where I‚Äôm forced into a box RP-wise.
---
yes, love the game too and also simply frustrated sometimes by this bug.
---
Not agreeing with life choices does not equate to hate.
---
I‚Äôd like to see that repeater laser rifle thing make a comeback too
---
Bethesda: the next dlc wave will be Battle Royale themed!
---
Community: *Scared Screeching‚Äù
---
Bethesda: And wastelanders will add human npcs an-
---
Community: *Happy noises*
---
I don't think it was planned, let me try and explain why i think so:
---
Year 2 will either be:
---
**1. A new game mode.**
---
\- Makes little sense that you can time travel between Year 1 and 2.
---
\- It would likely dilute the player base between modes, which i'm not sure it's a good thing.
---
\- Despite all that it's the less mechanically challenging to make it work.
---
**2. Year 2 is automatically added for everyone.**
---
\- Old and new players are put into a new world, where the scorched plague is no longer (or at least contained).
---
The major problem here though is that for new players the story will make no sense. 
---
You exit the Vault and the world is already changed?
---
The time 'skips' after you leave the Vault?
---
Or you don't start in the Vault?
---
Then how do you get the pip-boy?
---
\- "Old" quests won't make sense if the world is already changed, or they will have to be removed altogether.
---
**3. Year 2 'turns on' only after you complete certain quests.**
---
\- After you play through the resolution of the Scorched plague the game 'flips' a switch and you enter the new world.
---
\- The problem here is that players in different parts of the story will see the world differently, and/or might not be able to interact at all, which is a huge bummer.
---
This can work, but it would likely be very hard to make it work properly.
---
When it comes to Bethesda all you can do is hope for the best and prepare for the worst.
---
On top of that pick up literally everything you can and scrap it at a workbench, mark important scrap such as aluminum/screws/gears/adhesive so you can find what drops it and repair your stuff and upgrade when needed.
---
I don't think I follow on the pylon bit.
---
Please have more interloper
---
Lolwut
---
Hey devs, if you really listening. ADD TEXT CHAT
---
There is going to be a ridiculous amount of people playing just to hate the game and ruin it for others. Makes me truly wonder if this is a good idea haha. Also definitely going to have voice chat off during this entire play period lol.
---
r/fo76 : OMG NPCS AND TALKING OMFG THIS IS SO COOOOOOOOOOLLLO AAAGGRHHRHHEHEHEH
---
r/fallout : battle royale? this game fucking sucks
---
I just started about two days ago. Took ages to get 200 caps. So I doubt many would be paying that. Well unless they hardcore it.
---
Thank you for writing and sharing this! 
---
It's important to remember devs being people with their own ambitions and goals. And like everything else that's been brought to the game, I'll at least be giving all new content coming a try, even if it's battle royale content.
---
Thanks, it's been a brutal few months *NOT* talking about this, doubly so as I saw posts filled with disappointment and rage.   
---
So many times I wanted to say something, but even if I put up a cryptic "just wait" it would lead to questions and unravel things.  
---
I wish the people on the Fallout sub understood as well, the hate there is still strong and there is an entire section debating / arguing That there was no risk to Bethesda...  
---
If we had decided to "troll" Bethesda the damage inflicted could have been signifiant and they had to have known that.
---
This roleplay made me hard.
---
I can't wait to kill them at their workshops.
---
So i love areas that you can go to at anytime but be prepared to sneak or use a ridiculous amount of ammo and health. That takes me back to morrowind days. Yes you can go anywhere your feet take you but be ready to have your ass handed to you.
---
High lvl play idk cause im not there but from watching some vids it seems a lot of players are going for op meta builds.. Buy design.. And then complaining its not hard enough. Lvl scaling has been hated on by ppl in my old ass age group for a long time.. But its now the standard of younger players.
---
I would compromise and say dungeons aimed at high lvls like pharma.. And random events that happen anywhere. Time to gtfo if your not ready. Change of plans or server if your real stubborn.
---
Bit no matter what you pick ppl will hate it. It's the thing these days.
---
Sigh
---
*Unzips pants*

Listen to the Wall of Voodoo version.  It fits much better with the fallout universe.
---
Ignore this clown. Just trying to get a reaction on every post. Dude should be removed from the subreddit.
---
I‚Äôve been saving up around 500 purified water I‚Äôve ‚Äúacquired‚Äù while checking out players camps and vending machines. 
---
Time to give back. Show the newcomers how nice and proper we all are.
---
your friends sound like twats, mate
---
I'm excited about the new content that wastelanders dlc will bring, but as for NPCs and dialogue....I don't know. I'm happy with the game the way it is. I started playing it few months after the launch, fully aware that there are no human NPCs, and so it was never a problem for me personally.
---
I play solo, finished the main quest line (minus the nuke launch, feel like I need to get some better weapons to be able to tackle the silo run) and finished all side quests - so new content in that regard is very welcome. So now I do events with a bunch of other random players - and I'm having a blast. This part of the game is so much fun for me, better than having bunch of Preston Garvey type of NPCs with bland dialogue. Having said that, if they manage to make NPCs interesting, I'm all for it.
---
well the atomic shop has a sale ending in 6 hours, i would assume they will start the update around then and the down time will likely be about 2 hours at least, so id say 8 hours minimum before you can play.
---
I agree with the events and dungeons having some sort of scaling.
---
 There just needs a way to make older missions more tough and older areas just as interesting as the Cranberry bog and Mire.
---
No high level people really like to spend their time in some of these regions no matter how cool they would be to have battles in, I had that issue because my level was too high and the battles would be watered down because of my level.
---
I dunno
---
Do you guys ever consider that following new players around right as they begin the story might put them off the game?
---
Oh yeah, it was definitely not a great launch by any means and you're right. There's just a lot of people who are judging it against games that are of a different model. If we looked at it compared to other live service games I bet we'd see a lot of the same types of issues. It's certainly on the right track, though.
---
Better as split screen.
---
When I played last night the whole server was low level players and apart from me the highest was a level 12.
---
Thanks, not going to claim to be a hero, more of a mildly insane and "slightly" OCD fan.. ;).   
---
But the others, those 7 are pretty badass!  
---
Exactly on point, what Bethesda did with us was rare, all I can hope is it won't be the exception but the rule in the future.  
---
I'm not saying that because I think it's awesome to sit with the Dev's but because I think it will lead to be a better game for us all.  
---
Little jealousy is healthy, but too much can be caustic, and that's actually one of the reasons some of the others want to remain anonymous.
---
Who and why Bethesda chose person X isn't something we know, and could lead to "Why not me instead of person X".
---
That‚Äôs kind of good, but also damn I hope the hitboxes and such are accurate.
---
How much is the coat?
---
I believe, a while back, they found direct references to dogs in datamined perk cards.
---
Been trying my best to get to 88 miles per hour then jumping through that thing.
---
Not at all, being harsh at times is reasonable and justified, I am still brutal from time to time, I mean FFS why do Bulk items autoscrap with everything else still? It's one fracking keyword.      
---
Updated XEdit, hell yes!  
---
Once I get back I'll need it, shoot me a message on discord!
---
Stay in the closing ring of fire?  
---
Think of it as a tightening noose...   
---
You could leave your neck in it, but it's not going to end well for you.
---
I'll try this out! Thanks!
---
Honest to God, this was probably one of my favorite announcements today. So glad they are sticking with fo76 even after all the controversy.
---
When you're walking and the camera suddenly jumps 24 miles down the road in slow mo and you hear a bloatfly exploding really loud in your ear like a fucking jumpscare
---
I want paints for my FE gatling laser because I'm tired of people trying to buy it from me. Yes I know it's explosive. Yes I know it's legacy. It's also my primary weapon, so no, I'm not trading it.
---
Corn soup provides food and water.
---
They probably will be invincible, as vendor bots
---
I definitely agree. I've already posted up at a location somewhere between Flatwoods and Vault 76. Built a little camp with extra bedding, all of the crafting stations, and a garden near some water. I think now, maybe more than ever, is the time for all fellow responders to live up to that title and welcome new people into the game. Some are going to be nervous, worried about griefing and the such. I say we bring a little order to the wasteland.
---
We are all inside STEM.
---
Why is fast travel even enabled in Survival Mode? It should be turned off.
---
This would emphasize SURVIVING and get rid of spawn camping.
---
Make it so you can only fast travel back to your camp.
---
I mean, The Culling went bankrupt, but that existed before Fortnite. 
---
It does happen, despite my disagreeing on the idea that it's a bad thing for a free addition.
---
This is great news, the quests were getting really tiresome. 
---
Always engaging with the quests after the events had already occurred became predictable. Find Timmy, we know Timmy is dead and all we will learn is the timeline of how Timmy ended up dead. 
---
Now it‚Äôs time to be a part of the story instead of just observing it after the fact. 
---
This has given me reason enough to jump back in and get caught up on what‚Äôs been happening over the last few months. Thanks Bethesda.
---
I love that it simultaneously repulses, and piques my interest.  I have always personally thought 76 could use a lot more horrifying creatures to really capture the state of the wasteland and the aftereffects of nuclear radiation.  Things that stalk, and watch us, or hunt us down relentlessly.  I think every Fallout game needs that creature experience.
---
I just get them when people see I'm using an explosive Gatling Laser. They keep trying to trade or bothering me over mic or following me around the map. Like it's not for sale, go away.
---
If you didn‚Äôt ask why we couldn‚Äôt build
---
Refrigerators, sinks, or showers you wasted your time.
---
I think it's supposed to represent the blast from a nuke closing in, not a rad storm closing in.
---
i‚Äôm not really into battle royale modes but i‚Äôm going to give it a shot.  who know, maybe i‚Äôll enjoy it.
---
Erm, I'm pretty happy with my bloodied gatling gun, ok?
---
Eeeeew
---
FeelsBadMan, But thanks for answering :D, I was hoping midnight
---
I absolutely called it and wastelandslers is adding  npcs and probably faction wars
---
My issue is Bethesda will focus too much on my.
---
Might sound like a odd question, but are the human NPCs going to be scattered all over the map or only in certain new areas?
---
Absolutely. I've had people *legitimately fucking angry* that I play the game and like it. The majority of these people haven't even played it themselves, and the most toxic of this bunch hasn't even played any Bethesda game at all, let alone 76. The mob mentality here is real.
---
Shrouded wood armor? Is there actually a mod for wood armor? What does the mod do?
---
Thats a slow ass blast if thats the case...
---
I didn't even know a legendary Graham was a thing
---
When someone makes a mistake, then makes it again, I do feel like some suffering is due.   
---
At the same time when they actively try to make a change its our responsibility to give them that chance... 
---
Having worked for a couple medium to large companies the lose of agility is almost a forgone consequence, and I'm not claiming they will do a 180, as I'm not in a place to know that, but the fact they invested the time and money in bring us in makes us think there is hope.  
---
As for the BR mode, like I said NONE of us were thrilled that was next, and several of us were either ambivalent or flat out against it, but every one of us enjoyed it.  
---
It felt like fallout, it has STORY and content to unlock, so if nothing else I'd just suggest keeping an open mind.  
---
I'm still unable to talk about everything we saw / discussed but I will say there is some very cool stuff on the horizon.
---
I think a bloodied VATS crit stealth commando is much better
---
Ah crap. Just when I thought I could walk away from it. Live my life again. Re-join the real world.
---
Dont underestimate that first snallyghaster you see near Charleston.
---
I dont play wot anymore but my friend does. He doest play fo76 any more but i do. When we meet up we discuss our grivanes with the games. At no point do we make fun of each other for liking our respective games. 
---
We have enough mutual respect for each other to ask "i heard they are putting BR into fo76"
---
"Yea i know. Im not gonna play it, but they will also be adding a new legendary mechanic where you can reset your level and get some special perk or something for your character. We dont know the details yet."
---
"That sounds prety cool"
---
If your friends cant make a cohesive argument with up to date info, offer to answer their questions and explain the current sutuation. If they refuse then insist ti change topics because any discussion is a wasted effort on both sides.
---
The space station isn't a protected zone. I wonder what'll happen if we nuke it after it gets settled.
---
Which is like exactly what I linked. Sneaky bloodied sniper, auto rifles specialist, few hundred hours of research put into that build.
---
You can only activate pvp if both parties attack each other
---
Holy fanboy and millennial gamer alert. This game is garbage and you know it. Full of technical issues, game breaking bugs, a boring ass story, oh and you were straight up LIED to by Todd about the entire thing. Cyberpunk 2077 isn‚Äôt even out yet and you‚Äôre trying to add it to your top 10? You are the problem with the gaming industry. You buy (literally) too much into HYPE.
---
Thanks
---
WHAT?!
---
cool thanks for your opinion. Also, did you know that with a sneak attack critical and vats you can one shot a scorchbeast with the bloodied explosive harpoon gun? Don't believe me?

It sounds like you sure had an incredible, none of a kind session with the devs, and that's awesome. Congrats. But the actual game has been a broken, unfun shitshow since launch, and not enough has been done by way of actually fixing the gameplay experience.
---
I don't want them to fix 76. That ship has long sailed, and it's still going to sink, no matter how much flextape they try to use on the hull.
---
Start now on Fallout 5. Hire better writers to script it. Develop a proper next gen engine.
---
Go back to th drawing boards, and give us something worth our time and money.

---
omg I swear if Freddy is alive I'll be so happy
---
Yeah man but like fuck what people think üòÇüòÇ
---
I think the opening monologue of fallout 3 mentions something about nuclear fire and burning oceans. So for me personally I think the fire instead of a rad storm is fitting.
---
If that's your take away, I kind of feel like I failed to communicate the experience well, but hey, I tried.  
---
The impression I got was they didn't want a Fortnight clone, or compete with it, what they seemed to want was to include as many different ways to play fallout in one package as possible..  
---
PVP is your true love? We've got it..  
---
PVE is the best in your mind? Done and done..  
---
BR is what tickles your fancy? Jump into the water, it's warm!  
---
Special checks and dialog trees? Consequences and lasting ramifications, '76 has it!   
---
Just want to murder your way acrossed the wasteland, pick up your gun and get to it..  
---
Hell, if they wanted the best Fortnight "Fallout Edition" they would have made sure to bring in a few people who actually liked that game instead of actively despising it.   
---
Ohhh have you not heard my Power Armor Edition story?   
---
The short version is I've got no fracking clue, because my arrived over 2 weeks late with a staved in side....
---
Per the Bethesda Gear website if I open it to inspect the contents I couldn't return it, and I couldn't get them to respond..  
---
Then they sent me a digital code that didn't work..   
---
Had to call my CreditCard company..
---
Ya, I've got more than my fair share of salt to spread regarding Bethesda... And I'm not shy about it.
---
You‚Äôre not forced to get the reward though. It‚Äôs supposed to be the incentive to playing survival mode. The whole concept of the mode is high risk high reward.
---
I once was a Vault Dweller like you, then I took an arrow to the knee.

You may buy Atom soon in Japan.

The Atom on Japanese site yet.Check this

---
Shocked me. Had a friend buy me the game last month for my bday, I made my character and started exploring. 
---
The first few times I saw another player near me I'd run away, not wanting to fight and waste ammo I barely had. 
---
Then I had one sneak up on me before I could notice them, I seized up and was about to draw my weapon, expecting to be ganked like every other PvP game, only to have them do a few emotes and then drop a sack of goodies at their feet before running off. 
---
I figured it was just chance, a nice high level player.
---
Then it kept happening and it slowly dawned on me that I wasn't playing GTA online and I didn't actually have to fear every living soul on the server.
---
Tempting
---
You can pause/resume the download on the Bethesda launcher. As for griefing, if you do not want to participate in open world PVP, you can enable pacifist mode in settings which pretty much disables PVP combat (with it disabled, both players need to shoot each other at least once before they both take full damage, otherwise you only take a small amount of damage).
---
Some general tips are try to try collect all the items you see lying around you when you start (duct tape, screws, guns), and then scrapping them for junk items used to craft other items. If you do take a workshop, be prepare for PVP and possibly being 1 shot by other players. If that happens, forfeit the workshop so you don't lose any more caps and rejoin a different server if you have to.
---
it seems there is a quest line involved but im not sure if its stand alone or completely intertwined with the battle royale. the website has some decent info up.
---
Maybe its just that anywhere else, at the very least, didn't have all of its urban legends also mutate into real-world physical manifestations.
---
This worked like a charm. Tyvm
---
Its the fucking hungergames lol
---
I have a gun that causes 45 seconds of burning damage after you are shot with it. But, it‚Äôs only a 10 MM Submachine Gun, so you may need to supplement with Molotovs and real firepower.
---
How does that work in a multiplauer game? ü§î
---
I get that it was not ready for release and buggy af. But people literally just shitting on everything they had to announce was kinda cringe. People just hating to hate. Not giving a chance. Idk it was different when I was watching the other companies, people were more willing. People that hadn't even played hating. Just think a lot of people ride off other people's backs and don't form their own opinions, which is sad.
---
I feel like a lot of these balances would be right at home in survival mode, especially the VATS targeting.
---
It seems to be the raiders' main base of operations.
---
Oh, so that refers to the map shrinking, as they do in BR modes. 
---
I thought it meant that the mode would take place on a smaller section of the map, like The Forest, instead of the whole map (The Mire, Cranberry Bog, etc.).
---
I started yesterday, ill add anyone in the sub later willing to play, drop your namesü§ó
---
this is awesome. i‚Äôve been backing this game since release and this is just gonna show all those people that this game CAN AND WILL be amazing.
---
My hope is a Children of Atom base there, have the raider's at the Ski Resort.
---
If each round does 45 fire damage and you can dish out several rounds, shouldn't most things be dead?
---
In the inside the Vault and other descriptions say all the nukes we have been dropping created a "Nuclear storm" that has "set the world ablaze". Personally would still rather have the Rad Storm which would work in the radiation mechanic as a means of damage/death
---
Maybe you didn\`t touch the "sweet spot", like posting how much you like this game. Then you might get down-voted because we are not allowed to like this game according to the rest of the planet that didn\`t bother to play it but still complain about it.
---
Fallout lore: "oh look how they massacred my boy..."
---
Or is it?
---
I built mine at the door..
---
It does 45 fire damage over a length of time. Not all at once. Sorry, could have phrased that better. The bullets do their typical, weak-ass damage so then you play the waiting game.
---
We need some kind of endgame added. But as it seems this game gets more players with new game modes &amp; quests so im afraid players wanting endgame will have to start considering other games soon at this pace
---
Yeah the only thing that has me concerned is the thought we may be kinda forced to play the br mode to unlock certain things.
---
I don't mind br players getting unique things like guns just like survival but just hope it doesn't come to the point where its like hey you want this unique perk card or special plan well you can only get it from playing br etc.
---

---
Not to sound like too much of a dick but it kind of bothers me how excited everyone gets about the player base being so friendly when the game basically makes it impossible to attack people in any meaningful way.
---
Well damn, this is a little humbling.  
---
Thank you..   
---
There is always going to be anger and rage, especially because as a whole we seem to be stuck in a period of embracing, encouraging and rewarding this behavior..   
---
I'll respond when I'm not sure if it's trolling, or the point they bring up is "dangerous" to leave unremarked on, but otherwise work to ignore it.  
---
I'm not going to claim perfection, but I try, thankfully I made the mistake of dismissing people in other venues and learned from my mistakes..   
---
Glad it appears I'm succeeding there!  
---
      
---
Inspiring each other and leading by example is something we seem to have "forgotten" of late, and actually wasn't my intent here, just to avoid being a hypocrite (only complaining and not trying to help) but it's fantastic to know it's an unintended but positive result of some of this week.
---
The experience was great, I just hope it in the end has the impact we think it could/should.
---
Seems like its tied to the BR mode, which is really disappointing. Certainly wont be a reinstall from me.
---
This looks so good, I'm really happy I didn't give up on this game. Yes, Bethesda did some mistakes, but at least they're improving this game, and I think when modding comes this game will be pretty damn good. 
---
At least Bethesda is sticking to their roadmap, unlike you know, Anthem for example.
---
One advice, don't share your excitement on r/games. Their hate boner is back and altough there are people who can admit you can learn from your mistakes and make the game better, just like NMS, there are also people thinking this game is still in it's release state.
---
I do it for the nookie.
---
Thank you so much.
---
My friends make jokes about me playing Fallout 76, but they play Anthem, so finding a comeback isn't that hard.
---
I always thought it neat that aliens, demons and eldritch alien demons are all cannon in the fallout universe
---
You can also enable pacifist mode, which will prevent you from accidentally starting pvp
---
Lol wow, I can‚Äôt believe I live in a world where people like you enjoy being conned
---
This will be a nice distraction from adventure. Besides. It has cosmetics you can scarry over. Why not.
---
I don't think the Children of Atom exist in the timeline yet. Not until the events of Fallout 3 unless i'm mistaken.
---
They didn't even bother to translate the article in Japanese so I don't think so:
---
[https://fallout.bethesda.net/ja/article/2wU959pkgw2VOsCMPZSpCg/celebrate-be3-2019-with-the-e3-atom-bonus-bundle](https://fallout.bethesda.net/ja/article/2wU959pkgw2VOsCMPZSpCg/celebrate-be3-2019-with-the-e3-atom-bonus-bundle)
---
Can you get the free download yet? Mines not showing up
---
Oh I believe!
---
The work on ALL of the items in the roadmap were in flight before FO76 even released...yeah, that's right, they planned on the BR before release. 
---
If you know about software you'd know that is what a roadmap is for, to guide development,  without having to change direction for every whim, for a project. It's what is shown to Sr. Management and to investors, us, to show what is locked in and being worked on. The team that is working on NW has certainly been coding it for more than a year already, same for wastelanders. That's how large software gets developed at every major corporation...you don't wait to start work on Phase II until after Phase I drops, you start it 6 months after Phase I starts and you start on Phase III soon after that
---
Ive been on Red Dead Online and BFV. Both games are also drip feeding content (like FO76) So its nice switching back and forth, but we do need some true endgame that isnt a couple events...
---
Give it a shot, it's definitely improved. At worst you'll be disappointed at something that cost you nothing except time.
---
Hey can always add new maps later, especially if the community wants it loud enough.
---
Lots of unanswered questions. I guess we'll all get to see how well they pull it off. At the start, maybe it will be essentially 52 instances of the same character. As the characters diverge and get more complex, there will be fewer and fewer of them left.
---
Not defending anyone. Just stating the facts that this is the game industry now and people should stop being surprised that games are being pushed out unfinished.
---
As an Xbox One player I don't really experience major dips in frames these days, people like to overexaggarate this a LOT. And I wouldn't really call pressing left trigger and moving the joystick abysmal aiming mechanics, that's pretty par for the course.
---
On an unrelated note, for future reference, adding "lul" "lol" "lmao" "xD" or a ü§£ at the end of a comment makes people much less likely to agree with your opinion because it makes you look like a douche lmao.
---
I've put a little bit of time in this game, but I might need help. Is it normal to be low on wood, food and water almost constantly? I have a hard time just finishing quests because I need to make a diversion to find supplies.
---
Anyone else notice the art at the end, looks like some of the new things we might get are...
---
Plasma Caster 
---
Laser Musket (hopefully the thing actually has unlimited ammo, always thought that was incredibly stupid in Fallout 4 that the thing was crank powered but used ammo from your reserves)
---
Dynamite
---
Tesla mods for Power Armor 
---
Pistol one character is holding I can't quite put my finger on, looks like it could be a 10mm SMG with some radium rifle looking gizmos on it, but it kind of looks like it could be a Gauss Pistol (Fallout 2 throw back) or maybe even a Fallout3/NV Plasma Pistol idk.
---
Then of course we have the Bow, which I mean cool, but if its anything like the Crossbow its going to be extremely disappointing.
---
The game needs more songs to put on the radio. Feels like Buther Pete is on repeat sometimes.
---
I would say yes
---
Imagine actually trying it out then complaining about it. You might have some actual fun. I myself do not play battle royale games, but I'm eager to try this one. If it's good then good job Bethesda and I'l keep playing it, if it\`s not good then I won\`t play it. Simple choices
---
Copying your character from adventure mode only retains their physical appearance and their SPECIAL stats, but without the passive effects they offer. No armour, no weapons, no perk cards, no items carry over. The only other things you can bring with you are cosmetics (outfits, weapon skins, player icons, etc.) from the Atomic Shop.
---
You are though, if the reward is good then you need to go to survival to get it, there is no other way to obtain that item.
---
The game's worth a try. For the helping community, the hours of scavenging and shooting and looting, for the sightseeing... Just download it and give it a shot.
---
Yes üëç im switching between division 2 - eso - fo76 . Fo76 is my prefered game but even i can only kill so many mutants &amp; ghouls before my brain goes soft lol
---
If you can get linked up with a nice group or a fun faction than it can be amazing. Without the human interaction, most people don't have as much fun. I suggest joining some of the Facebook groups to severely enrich the gameplay
---
Survival would be better if they'd disable legendary effects at least.
---
When you suddenly find the milk of human kindness.
---
The main "game" in 76 isn't even finished or anywhere near it.  I would like to tell Bethesda to finish one thing before moving onto another.
---
They should have never started on PVP/Survival mode/BR mode until the main game was fixed up.   Basically what we have no is higher level players who login, check vendors to see if anything good is for sale in the shops (Which they plan on flipping in their own stores) and then logging back out.
---
Why? Because the PVE in the game is hot trash right now.  Even the latest content the Arktos Pharma is broken, where you'll have the enemies spawn inside of walls, very similar to how your own character spawns inside of a wall when you've teleported to a different CAMP random I might add. . . 
---
Lets just pretend that no bugs exist in the content tho.  Imagine for a second that every single thing in the game worked as intended. You still wouldn't have any sort of progression past level 60. You have no endgame.  There is nothing to work towards and the SBQ and other such "boss" content is laughable and is being cheesed by the players all day long.
---
Really what grinds my gears is that I know Bethesda wants to move onto a different game modes because like us, they realize the "main" Adventure is boring.
---
It wasn't Johnny Cash singing in the E3 conference though, it was the same person who sang County Roads for fallout 76 last year
---
They only can PvP to you if you are in the workshop. Big when declared they can fight you over the map. If you wanna take a workshop, just don't stay.
---
1. Food and water are affected by fast travel otherwise you shouldn‚Äôt notice a difference unless you do that more
---
2. They did nerf fusion core discovery. May seem bad, except it‚Äôs super easy to take the power plant workshop and make them at 100%
---
3. I think that they may have decreased SB spawn rates. Even if they didn‚Äôt, I know for sure they decreased the frequency in their attack‚Äôs so that theyre not so bad to fight now
---
Yes because fortshite invented battle royal...
---
More a joke than expecting to sell
---
6/10
---
On top of unarmed weapons already being extremely powerful, the Unstoppable Monster is the MOST powerful challenge weapon they've given us. It replaced the gauntlet I'd had since the first month of the game.
---
No one knows. Sucks cuz it will take awhile to download
---
I mean if you look at real world forest fires, when it gets going, it moves very quickly (like this storm appears to) but not near instantly. Given the forests of Appalachia maybe a large forest fire started by nukes would make sense
---
That's true. Or a massive underground mine, like the metro system in 3 but even more confusing and dark. Would make for a great addition to a BR mode and for the normal gamemodes to explore.
---
Most people in the game are the opposite of griefers, usually generous and kind. Be on the lookout for high level players, we usually wanna give you free shit. Even if there are if you‚Äôre not playing survival mode you really should never run into PVP unless you‚Äôre looking for it/claim a workshop
---
That's a dramatic way of framing it. I don't see the problem with only being able to get certain rewards by playing those modes.
---
First 50 levels are shit, some cool weapons are still hardly usable. Stats doesn't really help you understand mechanics (I mean armor). You can do 300 or 3000 dmg per sec based on a lucky weapon drop at any level &gt;~70. It is still not about balancing, but getting rid of ridiculous bugs, so any build you make could be nerfed in several months. PvP is just bullying players for not having specific perks, armor and weapons equipped at the monent.
---
You are a scholar and a gentleman (woman)
---
Easy Pete making a comeback!
---
Fantastic! Especially after reading the article explaining the balances.
---
Ok fast travelling makes some sense to increasing your hunger &amp; thirst rates..  
---
Not taken over any workshops as i was under the impressin that triggered forced PvP and I try to avoid it as much as possible.. May needt o recnsider that approach for cores..  
---
Good to know the SB's have been tamed somewhat..   
---
Hopefully with the new NPcs coming, things will liven up a bit in FO76 again.
---
&gt; but either accept this at face value or walk away.
---
You're forgetting the third option. **Double down**.
---
Jokes aside, this is great. I still don't agree that we as a community want or need this mode and I'm gonna be pissed if, as the trailer seems to imply, some new perks are going to be locked behind doing nuclear winter.
---
I think I bought it from the vendor that sells recipes in Whitesprings.
---
It could end up being hands down the best battle royale on the market and I would still gladly trash it to have wastelanders first. Fallout is just not the type of game or engine that lends itself well to pvp and it is glaringly apparent.
---
Realistically none, I don‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs talking about. They did tons of quality of life patches (plans having (known) in front of them if you know them already, a warning for scrapping favorited items, legendary vendor to dump junk legendaries, etc) and server stability/duping was pretty much removed. Biggest issue for me (PC) is just flickering shadows in the background
---
Everyone laughed at the high charisma guy... Welp now you all have to wait for me to talk this robot into letting us pass!
---
I'd say give it a go but try to snatch it on sale.
---
I am curious as well, but not sure if there is any official statistic.
---
Get the modded weapons and unkillable set ups in pvp first
---
&gt;  but the office in Dallas seemed to be primarily focused on '76 at that point,
---
I tried to tell people this a few months back, hell I think I even argued with you about it. That vindication, even months late, feels nice.
---
Yeah, I'm feeling pretty positive about the changes we will see post beta for survival now that we have BR. A proper survival game as opposed to a "PVP mode".
---
What a good idea! I PM‚Äôd you. I have a camp that I‚Äôd love for you guys to check out sometime :) I don‚Äôt use Twitter though..?
---
Launch was awful. Haven‚Äôt seen a server disconnect in weeks now
---
Idk man I watched my friend run around enemies spawning sideways in the ground. There were some frankly unacceptable bugs, even for bethesda.  It looks ironed out now but it was, and should have been, a pretty big deal. Car dealerships don't sell people unfinished cars, a restaurant doesn't give you uncooked food (sushi nonwithstanding), developers shouldn't give you an unfinished game and hope they can fix it later. 
---
That said, they stuck by it and it looks pretty good now, so that counts for something.
---
I love how each picture is angled so you are looking down at us all the while accentuating your massive... package
---
I just don't get why it's so powerful though? My best 1h with perks is 210 damage with perks? That's including damn near identical perks on the ski sword. Wtf? I guess at least I can use my weapon in power armor but even that is only used for nuke zones.
---
Probably when people wake up from sleeping, as Beth's employees are humans
---
If you mean the free trial week:  They did not give a time. Most of the time, updates happen around 9am or so for me (EST) so maybe around there tomorrow.  
---
If you mean free to play in general: It will not be.
---
I thought they called it a new game mode when I was watching the stream, which leads me to assume it‚Äôs going to be selectable as adventure and survival are now.
---
They showed the ‚Äúfootball‚Äù case off in the trailer too
---
I did the same thing.
---
Take your time and read the notes and listen to the holotapes while you explore the massive landscape. The way the story is told is definitely not traditional but while people were dropping nukes 3 days after release and complaining about lack of content, I was having a blast. 
---
Also there's perks like "pharma farma" that let you get more chems out of boxes and such but what it doesn't tell you is you have to actually push the search button after looting to get the extra stuff. Took me until I was in my 30s to realize it haha.
---
Does it really work for the main HUD? I've never actually seen even a pic of it working, I need my classic fallout green.
---
Football case?
---
A lot of us aren't all that critical of the devs, our criticism lies with the people up the chain, as you mentioned, who take things out of the devs hands and dictate what and how quickly something needs to be released. That in turn causes low quality, buggy and unfinished products to ship. 
---
Tbh, I was really against the community driving for a roadmap from Bethesda for this very same reason. It meant that they were hard locked to a timeline and if someone had an epiphany or suddenly brilliant idea, it'd be sidelined for content that may or may not be all that great, but they had the idea for previously.
---
I picked an owned lock by accident and got a 20 cap bounty...I wandered around Whitespring for ages trying to get someone to kill me to get rid of it...I'm level 95 but I sort've hoped by wandering around a usually populated area someone would get the hint.  Had to physically phone a friend to tell him to get online to kill me!
---
Amazon is getting rid of their launch stock.  It's always been like this with physical copies on Amazon.
---
I would try to hug her and cry hard.
---
Yeah I know there‚Äôs not :/ but from looking at posts and Fallout 76 trading subreddit, I see a lot more PS4 posts. 
---
BUT I wanted to know for sure which console has more active people playing. I have both copies for PS4 and PC but I can‚Äôt tell whether there‚Äôs more for each system.
---
I prefer being a sneaky bow guy.
---
It‚Äôs like what they have in real life, it‚Äôs a small briefcase that is nicknamed the ‚Äúfootball‚Äù because it holds nuke codes/computer and it gets passed to the President in an emergency so that he can authorize a nuke launch. The briefcase is usually chained to a member of the secret service, not sure if this is used to any extent anymore. But there was a small briefcase in the trailer with a radiation symbol right before it showed the nuke exploding.
---
Damn, how will we ever seduce the robot to get the key card, that lets you through the laser grid... Drugs, all the drugs.
---
Seriously though, Grape Mentats and Booze with Party Boy 3 can give 8 Charisma.
---
In conclusion, get high as fuck before talking to anyone.
---
I'd hardly call fighting the queen free it takes so much ammo to kill that bitch and then she drops 1 stars and wood armor sometimes
---
I'll try it for free this week, but I probably won't buy it until after wastelanders comes out in the Fall.
---
Yeah it was said, but it's gonna be a real kick in the irradiated dangly bits if a vault is only accessible in a specific game mode.. 
---
I have no interest in PvP/Survival and I detest BR to its fullest, so if that's the case then Vault 51 will haev to remain unexplored.. And exploring Vaults is one of the best bits about Fallout...
---
I'm gonna have to finish the main quest before this comes out.
---
&gt;big tripod things made in the War of the Worlds
---
I find the original FAR more chilling.
---
Though, it is a scary sound, just not compared to the original.
---
Oh I‚Äôve heard of the football case, I didn‚Äôt link them. Thanksüëçüèº
---
i assume it might work similarly to how companions on ESO work
---
I absolutely hated everything about that announcement. I was starting to get intrigued by the announcement of NPCs, factions and dialogue choices coming back... and then they shit on everything by saying "Hey! Here's a Battle Royale mode!" and right in the middle of it all is a guy wearing Hellfire armour - armour that shouldn't exist for nearly two hundred years!
---
Fuck Bethesda.
---
If your on xbox I'll help you finish a but quicker..  Up to you dude.
---
It'll be a smaller, instanced map for starters. They also aren't letting you bring anything into BR mode with you, so they don't have to track tens of thousands of individual items in 52 people's stash boxes. Lastly, building things won't require materials, so they probably don't need (or need to track) nearly as many harvestable objects like logs and plants.
---
Missed the live stream due to it being at 2am here, but what about private worlds? Did they say anything about that? NPCs sounds good, dialogue as well, but with private server/local play on top, we‚Äôve got ourselves a proper fallout 4.5 to wait for Starfield.
---
If you use the Scrounger perk to search ammo containers, there is a chance you can find a couple fusion cores.
---
As for workshops, you quickly set up a fusion generator to power the fusion core generator and then return to collect them every now and then. PVP is only triggered for the owner if they are within a certain distance of the workshop, I think.
---
I may hate Rose, but I love Biv and I think robots were totally cool. They just felt really useless since you couldn't do anything with them. So dialogue trees are cool.
---
I think there's not going to be quests or events.  Maybe there won't be robot vendors, too.  Who knows, maybe things like stash boxes wont be there as well, since we don't carry any gear over and camp building is free.  All of these things add surely add strain on the servers, so with them gone, stability goes up.
---
Ps4, but thanks for the offer.
---
Well done, you win E3, they gave you a free weekend. Even better, a free week.
---
Honestly I love this comment, it‚Äôs the truth. Imagine if Microsoft word released broken or Photoshop was missing core features expected of a image editor. Yes they can be patched but that doesn‚Äôt mean you push it out the door and say fuck it, we‚Äôll fix it later. Companies like Bethesda used to have some pride in their work.
---
Agreed, linking taming and companions together to make them useful further than just base defense would be amazing. I used a taming mod if Fallout 4 where tames could be companions and it was incredible.
---
Which is especially important for events such as Scorched Earth and Encryptid
---
Typically workshops are fine to take over. Only two I‚Äôve had issues with were the gorge junkyard or whatever when the game first launched (it makes black titanium and everyone wanted titanium so they could build excavator/X-01 armor) and the munitions factory. I‚Äôve been attacked by players 3x in 300 hours and it was only ever those two. Give it a shot, the mission to claim the workshop gives you like 20 caps anyway so if you lose the workshop then you only lose like 5 caps anyway
---
It was more of an fps with rpg elements. The conversation system and removal of skills made it a less complicated but also a lot more boring, as in fallout 3 and new vegas you could do some pretty wacky things with the right skills and perks
---
Could the inferno be the T-51b that‚Äôs shown in the trailer? Looks like Tesla armor but on fire instead of electricity.
---
Yeah I had a similar problem, in general fallout 76 has either a really nice or really salty community...
---
I thought slap damage was removed?
---
I'll be that guy. 
---
I'm super happy with your story, obviously. But "hearing us" and "fixing stuff" are two completely different things. Any company with the right mandate can pull in their customers and make them feel like their opinions matter (and most of the time, they do). Heck, I do it all the time in my current employment. Turn angry customers into future big spenders. Turn refunds into purchases. Take their feedback and find out what they expect from our system. Typical UX research stuff.
---
But my worry here is that Beth devs, or management, might be weak on the execution department. Pulling a PR campaign like this is easy, because there's not a lot of technical expertise needed. Just need to make arrangements, book meeting rooms, and get the right people to show up at the right time.
---
Fixing a game though? That takes competent developers, good managers and good/passionate craftsmen in general to pull off. I've always seen Beth's flaws as a company culture of being too lenient on their products. Daggerfall was a mess when it released. Morrowind, Oblivion and Skyrim were stuffed with bugs on launch. But Fallout 3, 4 and now 76, while launched with bugs, had a deeper issue of mediocrity. So far I keep seeing them (the games) being rewarded for their breadth, and not their depth. This I think is the main problem with Beth as a company: their philosophy revolves around doing a lot and not about doing it competently. It's like shopping in a value store: you can buy a lot of stuff, but most things would be of shoddy quality.
---
It's nice of them to do that, but I think unless there's a strong mandate to improve their technical competency in game development, these problems will continue no matter how many times they "heard us".
---
I struggled a lot with it in the earlier levels. Your CAMP should be able to set you up with all the food and water you need, especially if you set up a little farm near some water for purifiers. There's also a luck perk that gives you a chance to get double everything you craft - food, ammo, weapons etc.
---
Yeah, I've had numerous encounters with that. I have 2 or 3 buy an sell trade sites on PS4 an Im always having to kick or rename for that exact reason. People trolling an hating the game. You don't like it dont play it. Simple as that
---
The map will be reduced, so more players but less space.
---
No man, he‚Äôs just really excited for the new DLC.
---
On top of that, this scene looks like it‚Äôs taken inside a fissure site. Think it would be so cool to see the insides of fissure sites now that the scorchbeasts are somewhat diminished after killing the queen
---
How tf did you find this post, it was made a month ago?
---
Thanks, I'll need to start looking at the Workshops again if the PvP isn't as bad a I first thought..
---
I googled Fallout Free Week Start and it was the last result on the first page
---
Looks üî• too.
---
What do you play on? On PS4, I can load you up.
---
That vault starts with a 5 I think, vault 56 or something. No vault starting with 7 is in the game yet
---
My bad you are correct.
---
Just like irl... Check ‚úî
---
I had to go to google page 2 to find it
---
And scrap everything, there's another one out there.
---
Looks like some shit from dead space. Can‚Äôt wait to see it; I love the terrifying monsters in here like the Wendigo
---
Different countries get different results
---
But he stated he was using perks, which means he isnt doing a berserker build.
---
Becaus if he was, he woulnt be using said perks
---
PVP without 90% of players owning TSE.. Thank you BE.
---
A rad storm wouldn't be lore appropriate. Rad storms don't instakill you. If you have rad-x and radaway you can easily survive in a RadStorm and that's not the point of the ring of fire.
---
Did you know why you should go blind?
---
Because your other senses will compensate for the lack of sight. Just maybe your sense of humor will develop.
---
Late this year. After the next two updates
---
They're just ribbing you.
---
Shower thought: BR mode is their way of stress testing instanced environments. If shit gets a little weird in a BR match you might piss and moan for a couple minutes, but if the game CTDs 35 minutes into a 45 minute "vault raid" it will cause serious outrage.
---
&gt;I've started nuking workshops for the enemy wave spawning to get the High Radiation Fluids and Glowing/Hardened Masses,
---
My very first Nukezone I went to was Monongah, great for flux, but the Mole Miners refused to respawn, claimed the workshop just to the defence Event (No bad guys alive at the workshop either) - Got 3 waves of Ghouls, which was nice.
---
where do you see a PA skin in this bundle?
---
Even better.
---
This is going to be great
---
I think weapons and perk cards were said to be separate in it
---
Oh
---
It probably won't drop until noonish. I hope you enjoy your time in Appalachia though!
---
I have mine over there too. I think we‚Äôre gonna get evicted :(
---
Doubt it. Wastelanders are... wastelanders. In the trailer one of them says "You're from that Vault, right?" which makes it seem they didn't live in a Vault
---
Or idiots like me who love to see a mini nuke happen... All the time. OOOHHHH A ROACH... I GOT IT!
---
nukacrypt for the weekly nuke codes and the nukesdragons website for build planning and sharing.
---
When anthem gets an actual road map.
---
No they didn't. Nobody asked for a battle royale. Hope it turns out great tho
---
I downloaded it again and gave it another go on the urging of a friend, seems smoother than it did on launch for lack of a better word. And there were quite a few people on our server also. If you are playing on PC, I could add you.
---
Ahh the good old days of ‚Äùwhat the fuck, i didnt know they could die?!?!‚Äù
---
No worries. I'm going to play with my pvp character for BR, see if I can make him even more effective... I want that overseers chair.
---
Here's my hot take on the lore thing:
---
At some point in the questline MODUS will call on us as Enclave members to complete the design of a hybridized armor project. It's an enhancement on the base architecture of the T-51 (not dissimilar to Garrahan using the T-45 as the base for developing Excavator armor), employing a promising ceramic alloy dubbed "Duraframe" and taking aesthetic and functional cues from experimental designs used in the development of the X-01.
---
We complete the design and produce a few functional prototypes for personal use. The schematics are archived in MODUS' databanks.
---
Years pass, and the Enclave migrates to Raven Rock following FO2.  They claim the schematics from the (ruins of?) the Whitespring bunker, perhaps incomplete or damaged - but still intact enough to learn the secrets of Duraframe and derive the X-02 model using the new data. The project gets shipped to R&amp;D at Adams AFB, and (possibly aided by a certain ZAX mainframe to fill in the design holes) the armor schematics are restored during the events of FO3, though the Enclave loses at Project Purity before the Hellfire frames are manufactured and distributed to their elite troops.
---
Where does this design originate? The cheap option would be to explain it away as being salvaged from one of the (presently) ruined sections of the bunker, maybe as some fringe armor project someone was working on in the wrecked section of the science wing. Or perhaps MODUS draws inspiration from the design of the Ultracite armor, an existing T-51 derivative developed by the BOS. Perhaps it's an inspiration from necessity, as it may come to light the ultracite from the namesake armor is slowly killing its users Iron Man 2 style and a more viable development offering equal or greater protection is the only real alternative.
---
All I'm saying now is that there's a lot of stuff still entombed under rock and steel in there.
---
Thank you for coming to my TED talk.
---
tl;dr: We might be retconned into designing the Hellfire prototype.
---
Time to dump a bunch of supplies outside of v76
---
Idk. My hits never even register correctly at times. And I‚Äôm sure 54 players will lag the servers. Idk. This engine.
---
No he didn‚Äôt state that. Read the original post. He said it in a comment which I didn‚Äôt read because I saw the post and comment before he made that comment. Gtfo
---
Next up we have a Tinkerbench, starting price is 250 caps.....
---
you make a good point, well we will see.
---
Really looking forward on how they do it
---
The downvotes are not a commununity problem. All new post start with downvotes. I'm speculating now but this could be bots seted by youtubers when they cash back on the hate train on fo76.
---
Can you be older than 12 to be able to play and do you jump from a Bus before the match starts?  The only two questions I need to know.
---
So it remains completely optional?
---
except that most players will have no chance against aimbots now
---
I agree, the games buggy/stable state seems like it's reverting. It's less stable and more buggy than it was a patch or two ago.
---
Tbf, FO76 came out in a state that is at least a thousand times better than Anthem is right now.
---
I mean, they dont even bother to read the itv that explains how the mode is going to work.
---
Because that would tell them that ofcourse bethesda actually thinked this one trough and that doesnt really fit the ‚ÄùBeThEsDa DoEsNt KnOw WhAt ThEy ArE DoInG‚Äù view they have
---
Good thing blueprints work wonderfully.
---
same cant believe we're getting evicted
---
its an onion article you twiddly dink.
---
get outta here with that fax and logic
---
The only people who give this game shit, are those that are not true fans of the franchise, got banned or salty because they lost there immortality with the Sentinel/Cavalier Assassin armor. I could go on but I'm to happy right now, life's good and we are getting NPCS!!!
---
I want that overseers chair and desk to, I intend on tweaking my Pvp character later today.
---
Last thing, when I have this trouble I tend to revert to a track by Ice Cube...
---
DO YA THANG MAN, FUCK WHAT THEY LOOKIN' AT...
---
He's talking about wastelanders
---
That wasn't what he was getting at. Often times mobs spawn in and their models bug out and don't move, but they mob themselves do. The only way to shoot those mobs is either by spamming lots of rounds and hoping or just using vats.
---
üòÇüòÇ good one
---
They nerfed it a long time ago.
---
Unarmed weapons have 1 huge trade off: you can't use them in PA. Yes, you can get insane damage with a bloodied deathclaw gantlet, but you can't realistically use it in a nuke zone unless you want to run in a hazmat suit and forgo all your unyielding/cav/sent/whatever armor bonuses. You become the ultimate glass cannon.
---
They can be good for PvP, and they can be godly for SBQ battles if you can drag her out of the rad zone, but there's a reason you rarely see anyone running around Whitesprings with a DCG.
---
This.
---
Yeah that's about the time I stopped playing. Just wondering If they ever balanced it out afterwards or if it's still the same
---
I never use power armor. Nor do i run in hazmat. With glowing fungus you can eat a bunch of those for 20 rad resist a pop. Then throw some radshields as they stack too, 300 a piece. Yeah its a lot bs to go through just to not be in either. But when i get into power armor i lose weight cause i run a full weapon reduce set. Fatman weighs 2 pounds with it. And honestly with backpacks its even easier. Im pretty sure the base rad resist you start with is key as well. Even with all the drugs and food it takes into account the baseline you have. So i have 118. Not terrible but still requies me to have like 2000 rad resist with drugs and food to have run around solo in nuke zones with pa to get less than 5 rads a sec. Best bet is to group up honestly.
---
ü§£ü§£
---
I was literally just trying to tell you why he doesnt run berserker weapons and are constanlty being extremely hostile.
---
Dude, take a chillpill for real.
---
It‚Äôs a video game were talking about here
---
I was fortunate enough not to encounter a lot of the more major bugs but it's not hard to see that the release should have been pushed back 6 months and the first 3-4 felt like a beta. Thankfully things are stabilized now and heading in a great direction tho. I've still put in almost 400 hours toughing it out and am really excited for what's to come.
---
If this is true then it would be really pathetic from them.
---
some people just don't have the time to play the game and form their opinions, so instead of doing the smart thing and not having an opinion on it, they get all their opinions from the internet. it just so happens that the internet doesnt really like this game
---
Nice, I'm reinstalling as soon as I get home.
---
&gt; People seem to be forgetting that people bought Fallout 76 because they were fans of Fallout, and what we got was a pretty broken base game, in which they are fixing, but it's baffling that they're allocating time and resources to a... battle royale mode... that no one really asked for...
---
This is the big one for me. I didn't want or expect anything battle royal associated with fo76. This game was sold to me under the premise of "rebuilding apalachia" What we got is ... well you can rebuild a little bitty circle, don't use the whole circle though, or you'll run out of budget.
---
I wonder if speech checks will work with buffed specials. Carry a set of Unyielding around  and you could pass everything, except Endurance.
---
People are aimbotting in *this* game?
---
Yes, its a completely separate game mode where the only thing you can even bring over from your main character is physical appearance
---
Nothing about private servers
---
LOL! Call the thought police because we don't agree.  I love you.
---
If you can‚Äôt bring your gear and SPECIAL build then what‚Äôs the point of battle royale in Fallout? At this point just play Fortnite which has better PvP mechanics.
---
Apparently I have issues then. I didn't buy this game to play battle royal, I got it so I could play a co op Fallout with my dad.
---
Also 76 can't be the best fallout game ever cuz New Vegas exist.
---
I'm in Europe though :D
---
Begin new legit character. 1 because you fucking exploited and 2 they probably removed your nades and if they didn't you can't move at all
---
Hey, I‚Äôve been looking into this as well and as far as I‚Äôve seen there‚Äôs no updates for when it‚Äôll be on Steam. And yeah, the game should be free to play later today on the Bethesda Launcher.
---
yeah try survival mode
---
Honestly I don't remember how many people were involved, the 8 of us plus the majority of the Dallas office stopped what they were doing to jump in and play, it was more than 30 and likely less than 50.  
---
The NW BR style in the Alpha is so different from the core '76 game... I think it will make sense when people get to play it, but to quote a famous line..    
---
"It just works"..
---
This game will never have any content behind a pay wall
---
&gt;**2. Year 2 is automatically added for everyone.**
---
You already said it but it wouldn't make sense. Also, all achievements/trophees are, for most of them, are directly related to Year 1 main quest. This would make these achievements unachievable by new players and I know for sure, for PS4, a game can't update/change its trophees list. 
---
&gt;I don't think it was planned, let me try and explain why i think so:
---
Of course it was and probably they were already working on it before the game was even released. Can you imagine the amount of works? From writing the new stories, dialogues to implement it, then voice acting and localization (translate and record all voiced dialogues in all different languages)... This is impossible to do in a single year while at the same time, they also keep working and releasing new contents.
---
I'd just drop them but yea micromanagement hell
---
Good with salt has also been great for me going through all the cooking challenges. Actually did the SB one today took hopping around to 5 different fissures with butchers bounty so not too bad.
---
Does he have a pencil?
---
Nail - Head.   
---
In the release teaser they talk about your character, special and perks coming over and just that...
---
I love this so much. I always saw this game being way, way bigger than what we originally got and I love that we are seeing them add such massive events into the game, even new lore, etc. I for one LOVE the entire idea behind The Responders and I so, so badly want them to come back when Wastelanders becomes a thing. I've always sided with the BoS 100% in every game, but I might change that for these guys if the story is good enough.
---
Welp they made it a br mode and its not their fault you wont touch it because its a br mode.
---
You want the lore you play the game and if you dont?
---
Then you dont
---
hopefully it rewards atoms or some shite
---
They better bring that fucking Anti-materiel rifle into the base game. I've been waiting for it to return since NV.
---
Also, is there any other BR game that has enemy AI to fight against on top of dealing with human enemies? Oh, and they show a dude stim packing someone, so presumably there will be some kind of team mode and not just a 52 person free for all.
---
It's cool, I hate to admit it even now, but damn it's cool
---
What happend to the really hard vault raids? This is what i was really looking forward too :(
---
Watoga Civic Center. The future of events!
---
If your in workshop... Hide your squishy bits.. If not let them swing
---
I had a workshop (was in the building screen) and someone contested the workshop and immediately started shooting.  I ran as far as could before action bar dropped (well away from the workshop) and then stopped and got gunned down.  Respawned and got killed again.  Respawned and got killed.  It wasn't until the other player went back to the workshop and completed taking it that pvp ended.  By leaving do you mean switch servers?
---
Part of me like that they‚Äôre scarce and rare but another part of me really wants to dig into the lore of all that weird and wacky stuff. Eldritch lovecraftian horrors that were made by mans lust for war and nukes is just such a cool concept.
---
The fire in Battlefields BR mode (firestorm) dont instakill you either, you have a chance to try to get back to safety while eating damage. 
---
And Rad Storms already exist in the game while raging fire storms dont, so it would actually be mors lore appropriate. 
---
The presumption would be there wouldnt be any rad x or radaway in Nuclear Winter mode.
---
Its cliche and over done to try and use a fire storm, A Rad Storm would be original and more lore appropriate.
---
Like I said, Unarmed weapons have extremely high damage, but Unstoppable Monster is also Bloodied, which means more damage output the lower your HP. It includes rads you've taken.
---
The reason it might be so powerful is 'because' you can't use fist weapons in power armor. Either way, it's amazing.
---
Doubt it, vault tec also has one (if you can call it one) control vault in appalachia.
---
Really doubt they would just pop in another one, vaults are 99% social experiments
---
Cool, thanks for the answer :)
---
DUDE
---
They balanced it out by nerfing explosive damage even further for shotguns. But I think the game's quite nicely balanced finally after all those nerfs. Explosive remains top tier but people are looking at other options like vats acc/critdamage/faster fire rate and so on. Think it turned out okay
---
But they said it's a team of four game mode. What happens once you killed all the other teams and there's only a few from your team remaining?
---
You must kill each others?
---
Everyone becomes overseer?
---
It was nice meeting you! Join any market you want, we can even help you level up!üòä
---
Based on their track record with Far Harbor, I am cautiously optimistic on the matter.
---
Ditto my ugly, unfriendly brother.
---
See, I don‚Äôt mind how survival does it‚Äôs rewards. 
---
But it‚Äôs because you can get them in the real game within the name of course. 
---
But once you have exclusive plans and shit is when it‚Äôs fucking bullshit. I don‚Äôt want to play a totally different game mode just for a awesome looking chair that would fit perfectly in my camp.
---
Hm, legit question: how do you know you've been targeted by aimbot and not by VATS? Or by someone with large display, good mouse and great aim?  
---
I mean the only way to be 100% sure is to see it on someone's stream/yt video and then its just a matter of sending a ticket to have them banned.
---
Players will be launching nukes. One of their blog posts today mentioned that you'd have to collect 4 code fragments and a "nuclear briefcase" in order to launch one, and that there would be perk cards that would help somehow.
---
Wasteland whisperer cant tame anything, all animals and creatures that can be tamed are done so with animal friend.
---
Including deatclaws
---
I think they hit it way too hard. Just my opinion though. Made the game boring for me when everything just became a bullet sponge for my build. To each their own.
---
Like I said,  my 1h ski blade has the same perks. Perks do not impact **base** damage.
---
The Most Dangerous Game... Seeing if people read the post before voting with that sweet sweet karma.
---
Well they specifically said there will be consequences so we will see
---
Yeah like add an auto doc to faction bases that let's you rechoose your special for like ten thousand caps or some shit.
---
Shh. The disappointment will be funny.
---
And also blissfully unaware of the Onion if they think that?
---
it should be available to all players, not just those who want to do PvP or BR,.  
---
 It seems a really one way at the moment  
---
If its in Adventure then it automatically becomes available in Survival and BR, but if its in Survival or BR, its not available to Adventure Mode players?   
---
I have no issue with it being a seperate game mode, what I do have issue with is limiting access to areas, especially Vaults, to specific modes..
---
Send ticket to BGS. It will be resolved.
---
It isn't now but once the update comes out it probably will be.
---
It's my 1st recon beret now !
---
Radio freedom intensifies in the background
---
Make them so once they die they actually go unconcious for ten minutes instead before returning to your camp. Also if they're kept out of PvP thatd be for the best.
---
Is there anything added to other modes or is it just this mode and content?
---
Same perks or same legendary effects? Also what level is it?
---
Who else saw maxon
---
I'm getting it simply because it gives me a good reason for a deal and to support the game; that E3 has me knowing this game has a bright future ahead of it for a long time to come.
---
It‚Äôs not a leak, this is an official article of Bethesda themselves
---
Stop overreacting
---
Sounds redundant to aimbot when VATS is a thing, not that I doubt you.
---
Not sure exactly where BoS fit in the timeline. Bet you next years story is going to be centered around the enclave tho...
---
I usually put lead, steel and aluminium in my vendor and it sells pretty quick. I also put 3* weapons and armors for 300 or 400 caps so people can get some scrip.
---
Nah. People are still 1 shotting everything post nerf. Yeah you need to come up with some good builds to do that. It's just that you can't expect to do 1000 damage per shot with all those QOL perks. You actually need to invest in damage perks and so on but that's quite fair in my opinion
---
It's on sale for 30 bucks on PlayStation, you think it's worth it at that price?
---
I guess so.  From what i recall,  i thought they return the additional 10 percent difference,  but i guess not.  Regardless,  20% isn't so bad. It's like tipping your waiter.
---
Vault.. 76?
---
IIRC I have level 5 demo, two level 3 rifleman etc etc and I think my TSE handmade does like.. 130 damage? It's been a while so I cant remember honestly
---
And big boobies
---
Boxes?
---
I have to assume that anyone who opposes or shines a negative light on human NPC's in Fallout76 are either hipsters, or robo-NPC's themselves. Either way, they're annoying.
---
I mean.. without NPC's, how else are most of you ever going to get a woman in bed?
---
I get where Fallout was going with the no NPC's at launch, since the vault doors just finally opened.. but they could've thrown in NPC's from other vaults. In fact, an entire massive questline could've existed had they done so.
---
I see a lot of people who have cried about "lack of content", complaining about human NPC's.. as if they're purely throwing in human NPC's only to replace the existing characters in the game now. I think those people are too dumb to realize that human NPC's are added content, but oh well.
---
Personally, I hope they add thousands of human NPC's.
---
Maybe wait until you play it before you scream from the roof tops about how it's a gaming masterpiece yeah?
---
You can switch servers. But if you don't wanna PvP I'm saying you need don't stay in the workshop to build over there. Just install a extractor of resources and get out to your camp or explore the map. You don't need attend the "Defend... " event (it's public and PvP players usually show up), just wait and when failed attend the "Retake... " event.
---
Workshops are a PvP mechanic. If you just wanna farm materials or XP then don't stay on them. The PvP is easily skiped.
---
cause pvpers make sure they are not targeted by vats by spamming stealthbois or staying hidden and so on. but that don't matter to some people
---
This was worth the read because it was from you. I am glad they gave you the risky opportunity to give that sort of feedback on such a large title; the only developer I have known to do exactly this was Fat Shark with Vermintide 1 and 2 which really helped the game. I have a few questions if you are able to answer:   
---
1) Did you get to discuss how they update the game?  The most frustrating thing about reporting bugs is every update it seems like so many other things break. I remember one of the Devs mentioned they have a merge system for incorporating updates into the game. I am hoping they are considering making adjustments to this so they can stop making more work for themselves.  
---
2) Did they give any guidance on what helps them the most with fixing issues with the game? I am usually able to figure out how something works on a basic level from experiences with the mechanic, but sometimes I have no idea what to even report... Example: My friend's character has forgotten how to to use a gatling laser recently and proceeds to spin the whole gun instead of the barrels.   
---
3) Was there any discussion on improving the support site? I find it really frustrating that they have multiple categories for tickets but "Feedback/Bugs" (now just "Feedback") just kind of lumps together peoples opinion posts or suggestions together with tickets intended to just help fix broken aspects in the game.  
---
4) How do you identify problems in the game files? I would love to be able to find issues more in depth than just saying something new is broken with no possible solution to suggest.   
---
5) Are you the reason for the cap on ticket submissions? (Just curious LOL )  
---
Thanks for your service!
---
Hope theres lore to back up hellfire because that armor is special tjey gotta be careful with writing
---
With respect. Technically we were both correct in how we spelt that word, but I'm proud of my roots, as most people are. I admit I get a little irritated when an American thinks they know English better than an Englishman, but in the end, the spelling is not as important as how we use our words.
---
IIRC I have level 5 demo, two level 3 rifleman etc etc all the explosive perks and I think my TSE handmade does like.. 130 damage? It's been a while so I cant remember honestly
---
Bloodied ski blade, + power attack damage,  +1 strength. 
---
It does about 100-120 less damage than the unstoppable monster,  and I have zero unarmed perks, mutations,  or legendary effects. 
---
I don't have talons, although I should but I do have marsupial. I may as well get rid of 1h perks and just use the gauntlet.
---
It is available to all players, or is there something restricting you from playing the mode?
---
Wether you like br or not is up to you, not Bethesda.
---
Seriously, preach brother. Save the World was a really cool thing and it felt special. All out the window now. Fucking livid about that one. But I doubt the same will happen to Fallout 76, though, since it's core is so rooted in story.
---
I want to tame one so it can greet my customers.
---
[YOU DIED ](https://imgur.com/a/6Q9mfTT)
---
Wastelanders, I have a feeling they planned battle royale mode before people were even asking for NPCs, otherwise wastelanders would've happened a lot sooner
---
I mean Bethesda's E3 presentation was pretty meh, but it wasn't 76's fault(actually the opposite). They just didn't have much to show. But people like saying "Fortnite bad" and "76 bad" so they're gonna keep doin that.
---
It is already too late, someone is already hard at work on a masterpiece involving this creature because they know it will unsettle people. The Internet... The Internet Never Changes.

Fallout community is really afraid of competitive challenges against other humans. Things like ‚ÄúI hope I don‚Äôt have to win, maybe just surviving enough will do the trick‚Äù mentality is the reason videogames today are so easy and boring. Guys, videogames can‚Äôt hurt you in real life.
---
Not for me, let's hope the next pve dlc has as a similar amount of thought put into it.
---
I have 230lvl main, it wouldn't be nice from me, to let you power level me. I belive i can hit 50lvl before next weekend comes. I will add you to friends as i get home and join you later if you guys don't mind. And thank you one more time, for best fallout 76 gaming experience i ever had in 600hours &lt;3
---
you need to lower your health to like 20% with adrenal reaction mutations and nerd rage perk then you are all set. You won't be doing 1000 damage like you did pre nerf but that's more than enough to kill everything in sight minus some boss spawns
---
Ya i hope its ez. I would love to have my steam friends list back. So ez to see whos doing what and jump in.
---
Only if we can have them as pets too. :(

Are you still required to feed and water your character, or is there a non survival type option of gameplay now? I haven't played the game in awhile and was just curious
---
My camp is just wooden walls and a half a roof right now lmao. What do you mean exactly by setting up a little farm? Do you mean planting food?
---
Y‚Äôall Americans just need to stop with your folktales n shit. It‚Äôs gone too far. Mothmen and Wendigos were enough
---
I get a ton of backlash even from my friends. One friend particularly got in such a heated argument with me because as he puts it "Enjoying Fallout 76 means you are the problem with the gaming industry. You are the ones that promote lootboxes and pay 2 win"
---
We ain't speaking anymore.  Just ignore them. They jump between fallout and anthem reddits often.
---
Look. The vendor gives me 500. Why should I be expected to sell it for the same price that I can get from a vendor? If you don‚Äôt like 700-1000 caps, then go buy it from a vendor for 3.5k caps.
---
If you own the game, the new BR mode is dlc and is free to all players (that own the game.) It's listed as a sneak peak though, so I'm not sure if it'll stick around after the week and then be re-added later on or if it'll be like survival mode and they'll work to improve / tweak it while players can still use it.
---
Yes, BR mode is available to all players  
---
Vault 51 appears to ONLY be availavle to BR players..  
---
But I don't play Survival or BR - I prefer to play on my own.   
---
Therefore, Vault 51 is not going to be available to anyone, like myself, who only does Adventure Mode
---
You sound like you want to know what you're talking about, but I don't believe you do.
---
The only way is to delete everyone's base? Because.. they can't just store all the components of the base under the "stored" section of the workshop and make those players rebuild their base without the ability to stack foundations? Yeah, that would be impossible.. so looks like they have to delete everyone's entire base.. makes sense.
---
No you continue to come back telling me I am in the wrong. Just defending myself. Stop being a baby
---
Winter is not for me. I truly hope that we get the PVE vaults at least during this DLC for the guys who absolutely hate pvp in Fallout.
---
Odds are the YouTubers don't actually give a shit, they just want to get paid.
---
They‚Äôre just butthurt that not everyone wants to donate a serum to some noob.
---
what about the laser grids inside the bunker can you pass through them, it sounds like a bug try changing server
---
Let me kill ya, you stupid tin can.
---
That was my thought exactly. Maybe that was the inspiration
---
Would be cool if they also implement those changes to Survival mode.
---
Makes a bloody change.
---
Every other Bethesda rpg uses your buffed stats so I don't see why they would change that now.
---
Nobody here is attacking you in any way, you on the otherhand...
---
So anyone else wondering about what looks like a co op built  settlement around the crashed space ship?
---
I think you're looking for /r/fallout or /r/gaming
---
Fanboys getting excited for thing are still GOING to be released. Just, to get again disappointed. LUL.
---
What fucking planet are you on?
---
The main reason I‚Äôm even questioning it is because regardless of any buffed stats, you can‚Äôt use extra perks etc.
---
I suppose they can think of something, depending how long he's been alone maybe MODUS came up with the concept, he is a super computer after all
---
All you need is pop some I think it‚Äôs grape mentats and you can find n kill em lol not that hard
---
I did check that and I could not find any obvious links between this quest and the presidential one. Not just 'thematically', which obviously doesn't really 'add up' but also in terms of how is 'coded'.
---
Besides is on the Savage Divide 'rotation' along with the ones that do trigger.
---
However we know from previous events (Fastnacht, Free Range) that they can 'turn on and off' these ones server-side so is hard to tell whether is currently 'off' and to be enabled at a later date or is 'on' and just tricky to get it to trigger.
---
Damn mole rats gonna get me killed in BR i know it.
---
Stability has improve substantially since launch.  Servers do sometimes still have some hiccups and crashes in my experience for the past month, but it's been stable 90% of the time.
---
I'm like minigun, but have only one barrel and its solid metal.
---
Thats your choise, its available to you but you CHOOSE not to play it.
---
That is where it stops being bethesdas problem and starts being yours.
---
This is like saying you are mad about the wastelanders update not being for everyone because you hate fo76 and only play Fallout 2
---
How am I attacking? Please explain that one? You and your friend have continued to comment telling me I don‚Äôt know how beserkers works or that I don‚Äôt know what I am talking about. I‚Äôm just defending myself. I never saw his comment, just his original post. It‚Äôs just a misunderstanding, I‚Äôll leave it at that.
---
The stigma around BR has got to go. What could a totally free optional game mode do to hurt the game or your time playing it? 
---
The absolute worse that could happen is that it takes up some more manpower but that's literally it. 
---
High level vault raids and Wastelanders are coming so its not like they're shifting gear here with this update.
---
I don't understand - you either stay cloaked or get torn by VATS. If you are indeed cloaked, you still can be targeted by recon scope/helmet or berry mentats and shredded by good aim. I repeat - if you have solid proof of players using aimbots (preferrably on video), report them; otherwise those are just assumptions.  
---
I've been shredded and oneshot so many times, but I wouldn't put fingers on aimbot - it's mostly matter of gear (which won't be a factor in BR)  and tactics (which will prevail).
---
I don't mind having to play it to get the rewards such as camp plans, but don't make it a requirement to be the last standing player.
---
Just finished finding her journals about forty minutes ago and damn this ladies life fucking blows ass.
---
Where can I play the game F2P? All links I've found so far lead to the shop page where it requests that I buy the game...
---
And a drop of Nukashine for everyone!
---
Oh wow, i'm actually hyoped for fo76, how bout that. I can't wait.
---
I invited a co worker to play with me after tonight because he was hesitant. I'm glad this might be a push to give this game a shot. I've had a lot of fun with it! Especially when people are being diplomatic!
---
thank you for answering im sorry to ask this since when i search it on internet everything told me it's over 100gb+ which sound crazy
---
COMPANIONS!? 
---
I lose my shit. As a Solo Player mostly I would love that!
---
You get perks and gear from looting them from buildings, I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs not a bring your own gear thing or it‚Äôd end up like survival mode where everyone had a bloodied melee build
---
True! Fallout was somewhat a complete game with glitches and bugs. Also i don't remember the team delaying the roadmap indefinitely and subsequently removing a huge portion of it from their websites. What they said they would deliver, they really did so far.
---
I second this, what time is the Free week supposed to kick off on the 10th (aka today)?
---
It's almost like people don't want a battle royale! Wow!
---
I'm really glad that they had the foresight to not have VATS. As much as I like VATS, it would have ruined it.
---
Plopped into the game and then retconned if/as necessary.
---
Same as the Gamma Gun, widely available through Appalachia and weapon of choice of a faction that doesn't yet exist or many others that I won't bore you itemising.
---
When it comes to lore BGS has the last word as this is an account of things that never actually happened (master of the obvious moment) so personally I don't get my knickers in a twist over these matters.
---
Give it a little time just be happy they are taking the game in a good direction right now
---
can you pick a card or swap a point every level after level 50? or just one time only..
---
The whoopsies you get from the little babies or hatchlings (don't know what they actually called) the Mirelurk Queen spawns.
---
My Walmart had them in the discount pick bin for 5 dollars last week. Picked two up thinking I‚Äôd give one to my friend since he doesn‚Äôt have it. So far it‚Äôs pretty good
---
Well for starters you didnt saw his post, i told you and in the end you told me to get the fuck out of here.
---
Does anyone know what time the free week goes live?
---
r/punpatrol
---
Okay, but if they do catch you there they can follow you across the map and kill you multiple times. At least that happened to me.  I guess I wanted to share that.
---
i play on ps4 and the servers are usually busy most of the time but if you find yourself on a quiet world just jump onto another one, the community on ps4 is every friendly and helpful
---
use whatever system you prefer you will find plenty of other players on both
---
English please
---
I'd imagine this would be the hazmat suit version of power armor made to survive unbelievable amounts of rads from the fissure site. I'm going to guess we're going to get closer to the source of the scorch and try to destroy it. 
---
If the scorch still exist when wastelanders is released even though we've killed the queen then there might be another real true evil we'll have to face which makes me excited because I don't like pvp anything, I want more pve stuff.
---
the update will start in about 4-6 hours most likely.
---
I haven‚Äôt played a battle royale in a long time. It could totally be fun.
---
I personally would go out there, take one look at the bones of the scorchbeast Queen and the local Grafton monsters and then promptly leave and tell everyone I saw that the entire region is cursed and we should be happy the worst we have is death claws and behemoths.
---
Imagine being this naive.
---
Download the launcher and see if you can start the download. Most online games allow you to download the client before purchase because it simply wont let you log in without an activated game. But you will have to have a bethesda account.
---
I dont know if it will work but its worth a shot.
---
I never said that, I said gtfo which stands for geez that‚Äôs fairly obvious
---
Since you have to use a Bethesda account, I see no reason why the save wouldn't transfer between launchers. Achievements might not though
---
I Can't know if that's all they ever do, but they sure were focused on '76 at the time.
---
The more I look at the trailer, the more I suspect Vault 51's battle royale is a simulation. I bet 51's ZAX is reporting info back to Eden, and that is how Inferno PA eventually becomes Hellfire PA in 2277.
---
Looking at the article I'm thinking we are dealing with multiple factions of raiders and settlers for Wastelanders which makes sense seeing as how the game takes place in an entire state.
---
Ah I don't know why I thought it wouldn't use the Beth launcher. That makes sense, thanks!
---
They come see beautiful landscapes and decide to stay and are then promptly murdered by wendigos, Grafton monsters, mothmen, and probed by flatwoods monsters.
---
Yes. A lot. I've been gushing about how great the community is and how they help new players out, the environment and gameplay to my friends but all I hear back is the same old criticism and blatant hate, even from the ones that haven't play the game at all. I feel you, it sucks when something you enjoy is kicked to mud unnecessarily and reddit somehow has almost as many fo76 haters here to rain on people's parades as there are amazing people. What I did was (i'm sure you could have thought of this before me even saying but) I messaged and befriended people who stopped to help me in my battles, who dropped me a bag of goodies, who gave me a tour of their camps, even those to gave me a wave and left my claimed workshop alone. I sent people messages when I visited their camps, and complimented them on their creativity. It's so amazing how many new, positively surprising friends I've got! You don't need negative people bringing you down and breaking your heart, for just a game no less!
---
You don't need to stay cloaked to escape vats. Berry mentats do not work on sneaking enemies. I say this out of my own experience
---
r/punpatrol STOP RIGHT THERE CRIMIMAL SCUM!!!
---
No its bad. Battle Royale needs to die. Exactly how Zombie Games died and fucking Mobile Games. Noone should care anymore its boring as heck that everyone is copiying themselves as a game dev this is shameful xD
---
GTFO An internet acronym short for "get the fuck out"
---
Sure buddy, sure
---
Top 10 anime *redemptions*
---
Well it's a little bit of A and a little bit of B...
---
Marv, 096 please
---
Yeah, but a lot of people don't have 17 hours a day to grind skills in a BR game with shooting controls as bad as fallout. It simply comes down to wanting to enjoy the whole game instead of watching 12 year olds on summer break roll around in the new features while other people are shut out by a skill grind wall.
---
Thx, finally set up my farm at a wood pile, now I can make soup all f\*ng day :)))
---
If I log in and see my compound replaced by some douchebags shithole poverty shack I am embracing my presidents orders and initiating the fucking purge.
---
Lol    
---
So who would you trust? ;)
---
The twist in the end is we are all cylons
---
I'm very similar, I stock the shop with low level legendaries with affixes like bloodied or junkies at about 100 caps a star, that and swing speed melee weapons.
---
but first ask them if they want to get fucked. Dont just fuck em. Just because u like something what they don't doesn't mean u can just rape em :( Thats inappropriate dud
---
I bought the game few days ago currently level 13-14 . Having hard time to follow quests . I have No idea where to go. So ive been exploring the map at nights.  Building my camp and just gathering stuff to scrap . 1 big problem i faced is on build mode when trying to connect cables , lights , generators instead of connecting my toon jumps. It bugs me alot üòÇ
---
r/engrish
---
So when exactly will we be able to target scorch beast heads in Vats?
---
 When will dual shot weapons in vats be fixed and finally hit sth?
---
And who the fuck wanted a battle royal with this wanky pvp basis? 
---
There are so many basic problems and unsolved issues. They can talk all day long and try to make publicity by inviting people. But that's what they always have done. Don't be stupid enough to believe their shit until you see any content released. What we see until now was a joke. Most of the dev team is most likely already working somewhere else and the game is considered dead by B.
---
I have loved the flame from the first iteration, but it's always gotten thebshort straw with weight and ammo weight problems in fallout 1 and 2, not so great damage, and madeve weight in 3, and nv, 4 made it enjoyable, but still, just finding ammo was a pain in the ass. 
---
Now that I tried making a heavy support build and how far and few rare flamers came buy, I ended up scrapping my pyrolyzer and taking the minus eng dmg mutation and just focus on ballistic.
---
Makes me a bit sad.
---
But it's not good clickbait.. ;)  
---
Seriously though, we can hope.
---
But are there any hot guys
---
That's probably a bridge too far since everyone needs the same people alive and in the same location for quests to work and stuff. Although I would like to see generic traveling merchants and scavengers that we could Rob outside the settlements.
---
Great username..
---
Nuclear Winter didn't actually look so bad. Until I saw the creatures and the power suit or w/e it's called. I totally love me some bullshit sprinkled in...
---
The fact that this game was being built right around the same time as Fallout 4 it would be hard to believe that they hadn't already thought of eventually putting in NPC's in but trying a different approach to make a game that didn't have any at all at first. Letting the players mold the world before random human NPC's came in and started doing it themselves.   
---
I can appreciate this because despite how empty the world felt at first it began to grow with life the more that people began to play and with the new updates. Now that we have the player vendor update the map feels like there's a real presence. In the fall we can expect our actions to have consequences in the world which will shape it that much more after we left the vault.   
---
I'm really happy where this game is going and I'm glad that people will have the opportunity to experience it for free for a week. See you in the wastes!
---
BOS Combat armor. There might be better one but combat armor allows for legendary versions
---
i really wanted vault raids :(
---
Is there a easy way to acquire it or just get lucky?
---
Anyone know when the trial will start ? Currently on pc can't get it (at least idk where to look for it) all it shows is to buy the game for real, not a trial on the store page
---
Bad bot.
---
Yes, and I forgot that for a while..   
---
That's all we did, gave it a chance and then provided honest feedback and criticisms.
---
I don't think anyone knows, a bit strange to say they have a free week but not have it ready to go.
---
Maybe we will see a settlement or two ‚Äúemerge‚Äù as we complete the new storyline
---
Ok thanks
---
Please search reddit for  IS IT WORTH TO COME BACK 
---
People answered that kind of questions so many times
---
My friend not only was these brought up but we also asked why we could build stoves that couldn't be used to fracking cook with FFS
---
Eh I only got to ten before coming back last week for the long haul. The only reason I stopped was because I was sick of my gunshots taking up to a full second to register on my targets while molerats teleported up my thanus from across the room. When that stopped happening I was gleeful to jump back in.
---
Wow that‚Äôs really mean to suggest I would say something like that. Anyway, it‚Äôs been fun arguing over nothing. Have a pleasant evening.
---
Thank you so much for the post as well as you acting as a representative of the community. 
---
One general question I would like to ask, assuming it doesn't breach NDA.
---
**What do you feel is the fundamental issue regarding the poor launch and subsequent missteps of 76's release?** 
---
For instance, do you feel it's an issue of inexperience, naivety, bad upper management with unrealistic expectations, a lack of adequate resources to see to launching/fixing the game properly or something else?
---
I get that they're generally well meaning people. No one wants to produce bad work. All the way since Fallout 4, I got that Bethesda listens to the community's feedback so your experience just reinforces this. The question is are they really competent enough or willing enough to put the resources in to see to dealing with these issues properly?
---
My experience with Fallout 76 is that they seemingly go for the bare minimum effort in resolving an issue rather than spending the time to fix it properly. For example: 
---
* Ultrawide fix was the stretch the UI rather than design specifically for that aspect ratio; an issue modders fixed faster and better before Bethesda released their own fix. 
---
* The issue with the camp spot being taken, it was first just a popup message only, which then later became the option to hop to another server, which you have to do manually world by world until you find one not occupied.
---
Honestly, I'm hoping that I'm wrong with my perception of the company being either poorly resourced and/or incompetent at their ability to deliver, irrespective of how well meaning they are. 
---
While I grant there are certainly positive signs of the company learning from their mistakes and keeping 76 viable (they're at least doing a better job than the Anthem devs), I'm not confident the devs will be able to keep this up for the long haul. Not just with 76 but also Starfield and Elder Scrolls 6.
---
I think in wastelanders you side with either settlers or raiders so it‚Äôs a start, dlc after that may expand on it
---
Bit of stretch trying to use FO2 and FO76 as a base of comparison considering how wildly different both games are from one another..  
---
Yes, it's my choice to not play Battle Royale or Survival modes, but locking an area to a specific mode is entirely Bethesda's decision and is going to upset a large portion of the community who don't have any interest in playing PvP or BR modes..   
---
It comes across like they are trying to move it away from being a single player experience and into a full Multiplayer one a bit at a time..   
---
Given that the Vaults are a fundamental element of the whole FO series then this is a real kick in the teeth for Single Players.   
---
All I'm saying is that locking areas to specific modes, is unfair to those who don't want to play that mode.   
---
Also, Downvoting someone because they have a preferred game style isn't very sporting either ;-)
---
For me it‚Äôs the Marine Armour with Combat Armour Arms.. looks super good!
---
I have every piece as a 3* and barely walk in PA
---
One can only hope
---
I think Bethesda need to stop fucking around and do for Call of Cthulhu what they did for Fallout (and if there are any NMA refugees here going to complain about what they did to Fallout, here‚Äôs a preemptive ‚ÄúShhh!‚Äù).
---
Probably not for a few more hours
---
How do you find it just lucky or can u craft it?
---
I have said it elsewhere but if I log in and see my compound replaced with some douchebags shithole poverty shack I am initiating the purge like my president John Henry Eden would want.
---
I just want to say thank you. Thank you for pointing out the bugs, voicing our concerns, and ultimately caring about the state of our game. As a forum lurker I general don't voice my opinion as it's usually already told by others. It's great to know that the devs do actually care about out little mess of a game and are trying to make it better. I hope you continue your work at calling them out so our game grows and eventually becomes a title worthy of the name Fallout.
---
Come on!   
---
Thanks, I didn't think we needed it either, but in the end, especially after talking about some things still restricted, it made sense..   
---
All I can suggest is keep an open mind, and keep your eyes focused on "Wastelanders"
---
Only if we could overload a shot for more damage and penetration power, with the drawback of increased durability loss.
---
Ugh the fallout subreddit right now is pure cancer. Hopefully it doesn't push away new players.
---
You want the best legendary Unyielding pieces you can find. Sometimes you may have to sacrifice resistance for legendary effect. Keep in mind that other things can factor into mitigation like perks and mutations.
---
WHAT THE- 
---
 Hello 5 year old nightmare fuel a check
---
Rose is gonna be so happy to see them and then kill them for drug money.
---
Outposts help too
---
Imagine if they think that building is the same as fortnite, im lucky if i can build 1 minute without "object is floating" or "nothing is selected".
---
I‚Äôm ready to grab my mic and help out anyone I run into I‚Äôm gonna go back and place my camp near flatwoods
---
Oh I am gonna slut up the wasteland like sluts have never seen before.
---
This post was just meaningless hate.
---
It keeps saying free trial this week. Does that mean we will have to pay for it afterwards?
---
Omg, my Bloodied The Dragon already does nearly 3k. Let's implement this idea NOW! Pew pew!
---
OH MY F***ING GOD WE ARE GETTING NPC OH WOW THATS BIG. I have been with this game since launch and I can say its improved so much from everything we have been getting it‚Äôs really turned into a game worth playing 
---
Now we all know the game isn‚Äôt perfect with events dying out to quick or balance is a little shaky but with everything that was shown at E3 I think fallout 76 is about to become the game that maybe a lot of people in visors it to be for me I already really enjoy the game seen I started playing and I have been with it thought thick and thin 
---
Now I have a few questions about the npc im wondering how much of the world will be npc like can I walk into faltwoods and see them and area of the factions in game have npc too like can I see B.O.S walking around and especially the helicopters in game FINALLY HOPEFULLY HAVE NPC FLYING THEM because it never made sense they just went around with no body flying like did they just hit auto pilot and went on vacation 
---
Also I hope to see the overseer of our vault 76 because she isn‚Äôt died and it still possible to see her I‚Äôm hoping to finally meet her 
---
And I‚Äôm wondering will all our quest come from npc now like when you join the pioneer scout we talk to a robot I wonder will be switched to npc now like how much of the world is npc and what‚Äôs not that‚Äôs the real question will we finally have the full world of players and npc again like F4 and previous games I really can‚Äôt wait since it comes this Fall well I‚Äôm from Australia so if it fall (we just call it autumn) over in the USA it‚Äôs probably gonna be spring or summer when it drops here 
---
and I hate playing Battle royale because I suck so badly at PvP i will giver ago because it seems really cool and I bet all the PvP players will love it 
---
But I can‚Äôt wait FUCKING NPC BABY THATS ALL I CARE ABOUT AND THE NEW MAIN QUEST IM WAIT TO PLAY AGAIN...I have been gone from the world to long my friends to long
---
I'd love to be greeted like that
---
There will be a download, everything would've been datamined if they already had it in the files.
---
They couldn't do that cause we would all just spend all day trying to kill him all the time.
---
&gt; Also please add Ring of Fire to Appalachia Radio thx 
---
This! Also more songs on the radio during one or more of the DLC releases would be nice too.
---
At the very least, it seems like the space station is going to be the main hub/town.  
---
Explains why it was always so empty.
---
This kind of post is why Todd Howard gets to boast that 76 is one of the best gaming communities.
---
That is seriously awesome, loved the video walk through and the back story you gave. Well done üëç
---
Be interesting to see if they do multiple maps, each of the different areas could be a map on its own
---
Think of the limb damage you cold do to this thing!
---
Enclave Officer checking in, I'll enforce the law of America
---
Whooahh, calm down Driver Nephi.
---
Recon scope also marks people with a pip ;)
---
Anyone know when the dlc drops?
---
Interesting; I felt the opposite. I actually enjoyed the gameplay of the demo, but the story and setting seemed curiously muddled and uninteresting for a studio of BioWare‚Äôs pedigree.
---
50%?
---
Because Rad Storms would look just like all the other Battle Royales tbh.
---
You can get it pre-owned for a third of that lol
---
Yeah, keep continues to believe his words..
---
"16x the detail....."
---
[https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/news](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/news)
---
The Inside the Vault articles sums it up pretty well
---
&gt;That guy is the Ted Bundy of the fallout community.  
---
&gt;Change my mind!
---
Yongyea and Laymen Gaming exist.
---
Juicehead is one of the more reasonable ones that's stuck it out for the longhaul. Don't always agree with him but at least he's representing.
---
Hm, I dont VATS, but sneak in PA (yep) and always use BMs; helps me quite a lot. \*shrugs\*  
---
Hopefully the less cheaters, the better.
---
Yes, someone has a list for you. The Fallout 76 webpage. You can start checking out every Inside the Vault and patchnote since you left!
---
Like another dude said already: it's easier said than done. A whole new set or problems might occur when you implement said fixes, and then those needs to be fixed as well. They can't just use all of your fixes and be done with it.
---
I'm not saying that you can't fix some of the bugs, but it's always easier to tell someone what to do, than actually doing it.
---
It's not out yet
---
I just hope the servers hold up and Bethesda is ready. Not 100% confident they are but would loved to be proven wrong.
---
This is a legit question. I still have frequent crashing and grouping issues that require quit to desktop as a remedy.
---
TSEs and explosive weapons aren't as effective in PvP as they used to be except the very bugged explosive laser weapons (mostly the rifle)
---
Looks just about it. Though new NPCs, storylines and full-fledged game mode is quite OK for me. From a horrible launch to decent and fun game, not a bad arc. Unlike certain Anthem.
---
Im kinda looking forward to it. Im not a Battle Royale fan and i don't like the term Battle Royale, but i have no reason to hate for games adding them. This one also looks to be quite cool in comparison to other Battle Royales out there.
---
Beyond that...
---
Most of our folktales aren‚Äôt American though.
---
They‚Äôre almost entirely based on European settler stories or even existed in the old countries.
---
(We do like us some aliens tho)
---
The hellfire armour was introduced in a Fallout 3 DLC so I believe it already has its lore.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Enclave_Hellfire_armor
---
Yeah cant find it either. So much for june 10th. 50% sale is live tough
---
r/gamingcirclejerk
---
Yeah, feels really weird.
---
Wonder how all the edgelords feel after shitting on 76 on their way to Anthem. 
---
Not normally a schadenfreude kind of person but I'll make an exception for those arseholes :)
---
I only buy digital ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Its not out for a few hours.
---
Not really, I find the more traditional nuclear-alert-whathaveyou sirens more ominous and spine-chilling. Another weird thing is that you hear the in-game siren/alert as if there are loudspeakers every 5 meters and one always where you stand. Or is it supposed to be played on your pip-boy? Then what is the point of the siren?
---
I go functional, but I like your style. Mine is level 1 BoS rifle, 5 healing salves, 5 diluted radaways and 5 purified water. Got 15 Nukashines, so I might toss one in just for fun.
---
That‚Äôs only been true for the last couple patches. The player base has been pretty damn friendly since launch. Griefers existed, but they were rare. They‚Äôre basically extinct now because there‚Äôs no way to grief.
---
Probs in the next 50 years after the Third World War 
---
Jk jk 
---
Couldn't help myself
---
Interesting, I basically went all in with unarmed once I started getting them though too. Is the Ski sword the strongest 1 hander at base?
---
Either way, if you're thinking about going talons, etc... it's a heck of a lot of fun to tank the SB queen while punching her in the batty noggin.
---
Wow. Well there guy you ought to calm down just a tish. I know what im getting with a CD Projekt Red game. I liked FO76 because of what it could do and thankfully what i was expecting is actually coming. 
---
I do not buy into hype. I also dont need to justify myself to you.
---
Ash heap vault is vault 63
---
We don't have roadmap yet, but the first patch will not contain any of the BR stuff, at least not in game, probably hidden in files. So I guess later early to mid July for some of the stuff.
---
I wonder at his evidence. Between VATS, recon scopes (or recon mod for x-01 helmet, if you PVP in PA), and berry mentats, there‚Äôs a lot of ‚Äúhacks‚Äù already built into the game.
---
Don't be shy, I've been being that guy for a while now, without the Devils advocates and naysayers the world would be a terribly boring place.   
---
And there is a big difference between hearing us and doing something about what we've brought to the table, and in the end we will know before long which this was.
---
Yes you are correct, there is the chance the event was a calculated, well engineered attempt to create a group of manipulated "influencers".   
---
But it still seems like an expensive and convoluted way to do it.    
---
Why bring a studio to a grinding halt, fly in not only the people they want to manipulate from all over the world but also bring in nearly the entire '76 team to one location, when it would be easier to bring in a handful of the '76's middle tier reps, and local Fallout fans,  and toss us in a conference room in Bethesda, MD?  
---
As for the rest, I joined the community with Fallout 4 being my first Bethesda game, so I can't speak to the issues before that, but after FO4 launched I witnessed much of the same dissatisfaction, and even as it was expanded with FarHarbor and NukaWorld both of which brought solid content there were
---
Many new complaints, it's impossible to please everyone, and Bethesda does have many many issues to address with '76, but my trip to TX gives me hope.
---
You can craft it. But you can't craft legendary. The best in terms of protection is heavy combat. The next best is marine, which also had better rade resist, and I believe better energy resist. Plus I think it looks cooler.
---
As for aquireing legendary its all about luck
---
Yeah i had been down votes into oblivion when i pointed that out. People are people and have serious flaws. Its show very evidently on reddit.
---
The vendor at the Grafton Train Station sells plans for BOS Combat armor mods for some reason, no complaints here though!
---
Is there a list of plans that the game practically gives you so that we know what not to sell?
---
Is there a way to get the legendary effect on them if I buy them?
---
I find your lack of supports needing support discouraging. I always get this message for foundations and supported floors.
---
I knew there was a reason why I was waiting until this week to purchase some atoms for the blackbird paint! Nice to get a few extra atoms and an extra outfit out of my purchase, the repair kits I'm not so bothered about they will be unused along with my ones that have dropped from the queen.
---
THIS. So many of the locations in F76 are so underwhelming and empty.
---
TLDR: i'm a picky asshole, i demanded a company explanation about a game that i paid 60 bucks because i feel robbed and didn't like it. They invite me to their studios and let me play the next dlc.
---
and you know what? they aren't that bad! almost like persons! who would've known? lul
---
I think it's going to be really fun. I don't know why people hate on it if it gives people something fun to do. I haven't played a ton of Battle Royale games so I'm looking forward to it.
---
You forget how rare and precious caps are when you start out....
---
I'll side with the most beneficial faction to the United States Government. God bless America!
---
From what Beth said Caps &amp; XP earned will carry back to adventure
---
Sneak peek this week and official release i think this fall. The sneak peek will last for a week june 10 -june 17. I think this week is more about a stress test and feed back.
---
Vending machines are huge new feature for the trading community. Also the stash limit is now 800.
---
I totally agree with you. I'm glad that Todd was able to boast quite opening about having a great community. Not too many gaming companies/franchises can say the same.
---
I just hope that one day we'll be able to move away from the "we screwed up. again." parts of the presentation. Hope that they REALLY do learn from the experiences and Fallout 4 and Fallout 76 and actually make sure enough time and effort is put before a game is released.
---
? Firestorm from BFV is literally a wall of fire that looks exactly like Nuclear Winter...
---
Car dealerships do sell people unfinished cars. That's why there are recalls and lawyers figuring out how much a recall will cost compared to the cost of lawsuits for deaths.
---
They showed a new kind of crossbow no?
---
They still need food and drink.  I doubt that would ever change.
---
You'd have to find legendary combat armor, and put the BOS mod on it.
---
Yup usually happens when theres nothing else than support
---
and Radstorm would be just like Fortnite and PUBG.
---
"Any perks earned in Nuclear Winter are exclusive to that mode and will not carry over."
---
Not everyone lives wherever the fuck they live. Like, it's 11AM here, so  it's a perfectly valid question.
---
Is there a easy way to find combat armour or a best spot or just pure luck
---
Unless the studio dissolves, of course it won't be all they ever do. But for now and the foreseeable future, it makes the most sense to have one studio primarily in charge and taking help from other studios as they need it. Since Fo76 is supposed to be a living evolving game, it makes sense to keep one main studio on it and because of the nature of the game, that studio will have to stay on it.
---
Personally not interested in battle royale mod but if they can make it work for those that are interested, that'd be awesome.
---
I just hope they don't lock anything significant behind the Nuclear Winter "Play-wall". Seems like cosmetics only but they said the same of the Atom Store...
---
You have to find a legendary armor and then apply the BOS mod (Grafton sells BOS plans). You can't apply a legendary effect
---
Because loads of other players sell it for 500 or less. You‚Äôre pricing yourself out of the market, that‚Äôs why. I sell for 500, because vendor only gives 450 for it. Keeps leeches from buying out my stock to resell to vendors.
---
But that's not really efficient.
---
Im just glad Bethesda still cares about the game instead of listening to their "fans" on r/Fallout lol.
---
But at least we're all happy now, or until people find something else to hate about the game.
---
I mean, it works for sharing perk cards with your team so I don't see why not.
---
My advice to you, as a new vault dweller, is to enjoy the story, and take your time to breath in the atmosphere. It's only getting longer and better story wise, and it's easy to get caught up in the grind for level and power and forget to enjoy the content properly.
---
Server performance sure, but general optimization has helped little with the game dropping frames and stuttering all the time, no matter the graphical settings.
---
Ooh ok so tomorrow is like a TTS for it?
---
Because that doesn‚Äôt work. Things are worth whatever people are willing to pay for it. Some noob out of the vault isn‚Äôt going to want to pay 2k caps for a traveling leather long coat, but a high level player who has the caps and doesn‚Äôt want to spend time farming for it often will.
---
Very true, but the Hellfire armor is developed/fielded around 2277, and Fallout 76 takes place in the year 2102.
---
When is the trial period?
---
Well,  we'll have to try it, right ?
---
But hell, if we start with no weapon and no perk card, and then we build up our char during the match... I say: why not.
---
I will try for sure.
---
They have data mined it, leaks about the challenges have been out since last update. Likely to be a update
---
I suggested this many times, and people called me crazy for wanting to remove "a core aspect from Fallout".
---
&gt; 51 died and the 52nd is the 1 remaining. Kinda a pun on the game mode 
---
It's not a pun. A clever reference maybe but not a pun. 
---
A pun would be that the game mode is called Nuclear Winter because you nuke your opposition clear until you win... ter.
---
The team disbands like in Koh-Lanta.
---
It would be less efficient for someone to waste their time typing all of the changes (and there are a lot) for you, when there's a webpage that has it all already.
---
The armor itself can be crafted of course, but if you're going for legendaries, that's all RNG.
---
Oooh, exciting. Looking forward to new content in FO76.
---
Mine's up at the Acid Node right there.    It's Really Secluded back there and i like it.    Once they Added in Vault 51 i knew it was only a matter of time.   Hopefully the added foot traffic up there will help move some of my Plans out of the my vendor machine.
---
Back in winter you could have bought them from merchants. Now all of them have the same stock, so, I guess, no?
---
Should either be based on PvP kills or not exist
---
I'm waiting for the FilthyCasuals sub to make a mocking post about all the "farewell camp" posts.
---
Even if every settlement needs my help, I'm there. Or actually I can be Preston's great-great-grandfather!
---
Now that I‚Äôve seen the road map, I think it was always planned. I think first phase was about us as players and make a community. Then adding npcs to expand the world.
---
Did a Commander Keen iOS/Android game deserve three-five minutes on stage? I don‚Äôt think it did. Did Blades? Did all of these Cinematic trailers need to be here? Frankly, I believe we needed gameplay, enticing gameplay, especially since a ton of people lost faith in them due to Fo76.
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong I‚Äôm an avid Bethesda fan (I like to defend them when people call them trash online, when all those turncoat dicks play them off to be the new EA), but they really needed to hit this one out of the ballpark in order to regain a lot of people‚Äôs confidence in them. Overall it seemed incredibly boring to sit through, especially during that Commander Keen point. So much so I literally started playing Fo76 and put the press conference on the background while I played. That‚Äôs how much it enticed me.
---
I really don‚Äôt want to see one of my favorite companies fall out of the limelight, and I just want Bethesda rondo right. We all know that there are a ton of toxic ‚Äúgamers‚Äù out there rn who will call any reveal that didn‚Äôt appeal to them in one bit ‚Äútrash‚Äù, and Bethesda needed to prove them wrong. This year didn‚Äôt do that. This Press Conference only solidified Bethesda (in the minds of the toxic r/gaming redditor) ‚ÄúCares only about money‚Äù. I‚Äôm not saying it appeared like that to me, but it almost certainly did for other people.
---
It was planned out, think about it vault 76 was the first vault to open it's doors so of course there wouldn't be NPCs just us the players roaming around Appalachia "rebuilding society" so it would only make sense to add NPCs at a later date
---
Unfortunately, not that I'm aware of.
---
But, any workbench (Power Armour maybe worth selling)
---
Light armour plans (Metal especially)
---
Ulracite PA Plans (Not the Plans for Mods, This one REALLY annoys me, the plan for a full set is 100% free, yet because it's an SBQ drop, people try and sell them)
---
Sigh. Clearly you didn't read what I wrote. I'm asking if there is a list, not for it's creation. Often games have a wiki or quick tldr of patch notes. So far, I can't find one for F76 outside of an extremely tedious website and a toxic community. Lol
---
Radio better be allowed in br
---
If they added NPCs at launch it wouldn't go right with the lore
---
Can‚Äôt even see it‚Äôs bundle thing anywhere...
---
You could buy only level 1 - 2 - 3.
---
Which is prerequisite for chance on drop for 4 (pretective),  which should be prerequisite for 5 - shielded.
---
..
---
I cannot imagine how I could miss opening when they were available for sale. I am chasing them ever since I find out there is something like shielded underarmour.
---
Oh come on, it‚Äôs not that hard to learn how to play a game competitively. People that complain about ‚Äúskill grind walls‚Äù are players that never even try to get good. You don‚Äôt need that much time. Don‚Äôt pretend that anyone that is better than you is just a kid with no life.. A lot of us work full time but we put in some time to practice and we get good.
---
&gt; OH MY F***ING GOD WE ARE GETTING NPC OH WOW THATS BIG.
---
I thought this was sarcasm when I read it. But no, you're actually saying this unironically. Just to imagine that people would be so extatic for an MMO to add humanoid NPCs months after release in the year 2019. Humanoid and other NPCs were there in the very first MMOs, then the fully 3d oper world MMOs with Everquest, Dark Age of Camelot and World of Warcraft - all had thousands of NPCs filling the world. 
---
It's just so hilarious to see people's standards fall so low that they are genuinely extatic over an MMO bringing actual NPCs months after release. I can't even.
---
Loot boxes?
---
I'm sort of disappointed with wastelanders tbh. It feels like Bethesda isn't sticking to their guns with this one and they should have. It's mostly muddling the game up even further rather than clarifying what the game actually is. Is it a themepark mmo now? A multiplayer sandbox? A battle royal? If you try to make your game appease too many people it will end up being a middle ground okay-ish game that no one is really that hyped about. At least that's my opinion. I want fo76 to be master of pve multiplayer not jack of all trades. I think this game feels best as a sandbox exploration game. The stories that unfolded before us via dead scenes, notes and holotapes were masterpieces if you bothered to delve into them. As you explore you can occupy yourself with killing and looting. Making your toon a truly unique thing or going for pure power.
---
As for keeping an open mind, I will, but unless I'm forced to play nuclear winter for exclusive rewards to take back into adventure, then I'll probably only use it as a means to level my 5th toon if that's even viable.
---
You guys should check out that article from Kotaku where they have interviewed Former BioWare workers. At lot of stuff happened throughout the making of that game including a complete revamp of what the game was originally gonna be. Reading it, BioWare is to blame but EA definitely played a part of it.
---
OK thanks I'll have a look :)
---
Who else feel the OVERHYPE?
---
That‚Äôs only for the Nuclear Winter mode. A regular adventure mode holds up to 25 max iirc.
---
It is amazing that they'd rather invest in a passing fad than actually fixing the game.
---
I've never seen a game released the exact moment they announce it at E3 and yet people get excited for games STILL going to be released. What's your point, exactly?
---
I do not price mine to sell. There‚Äôs no reason to sell at a low price just because players selling at a low price are stupid. Plus, people do buy them at my price of 700 which is already doing them a favor.
---
Can you mark it on the map for me?
---
It‚Äôs probably due to be released on the 10th in the US, which means that it may vary from country to country.
---
For example it‚Äôs 7PM Monday the 10th here in Australia.
---
Right straight from Evil Within.
---
Glad someone else understand that this was a gamble for them...    
---
1) Great question!  
---
Yes and there was some dissatisfaction here.  
---
I felt like the answer about reintroduced bugs was not completely "perfect", when I brought up the version control issue, a few different responses were given. It was brought up early on and I was balancing being aggressive and not burning bridges before the day was a quarter done.    
---
2) Detail, photos and Videos, perk load outs and Legendaries equipped.  
---
Basically as much organized and well defined information as possible.  
---
Specifically they were satisfied with the template I use and didn't have any suggested changes. (Btw I'd like to hear more about this later once I'm back home..). 
---
3) Yes..  As I understand it a great deal of though was put into the site, I also expressed dissatisfaction with it.   
---
Hoping that much like the new system to report players dynamically we will see some of the same improvements for bug reporting.  
---
4) I've done "a little" modding for FO4 and the core of '76 is based on that framework.   
---
Using XEdit I've often through brute force found some of the issues by working backwards, for example from a issue with a weapon to what's failing to function in game..    
---
5) There is a cap now? Seriously?   
---
How many tickets?  
---
Maybe, and I'm sorry if that's the case..
---
Imagine being excited for...NPCs being added in an MMO game, months after its release without them. Everquest had thousands of NPCs, all in a huge open world, just as literally any other MMORPG. And that was in 1999. Now, in a year two thousand fucking nineteen we are unironically EXCACTIC over a triple A MMO adding fucking NPCs, months after its release.
---
Is this even real?
---
Well I just dealt with a guy trying to troll or shit on me for being a hype follower. Im far from it. 
---
Anyway, my renter and his daughter both play 76 and love it. There is a temporary worker who comes in for one of our temp agencies that plays it. There are far more people playing it (looks at the number of active subs in the sub reddit alone) than there are that actively shit on it. Our sub reddit isnt even the whole community, there are many more who simply play their game and enjoying the hell out of it.
---
Never listen to sheep, whether they are for or against something. Make up your own mind and follow your own path. Ally with those whose beliefs parallel your own. Always have your own mind. Fuck everyone else.
---
Have no clue on what's tts. Haven't had my morning coffee yet.
---
Unless there is no other way to obtain plans for my camp or cosmetics for my character so I'm not forced to play that mode, I'm uninterested but glad for anyone who wanted it.
---
Like a technical test server where they try everything out to report bugs and glitches to fix them before full release
---
dramatic f76 player: fk BR i don't want that!
---
*see trailer 
---
dramatic f76 player: well.. didn't look that bad... 
---
but what about the camps? they never load! all the enemies teleports to their side when i try to hit them whyyyyy? why you stressing me like this now?  ahgggg and thst shit PA didn't respect the lore
---
me: but didn't you say u didn't like br from the start? you are a thief of joy
---
And you didn't read my comment. There's a list, a very detailed one, right in the F76 webpage.
---
What if players had less stash space so that they have to be picky in what they pick up? Maybe it will create a very diverse player driven economy.
---
I most definitely agree  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_\/¬Ø 
---
Let /r/fallout bellyache about the lore.
---
Nah, it's just a free week instead of a free weekend.
---
That giant flying dragon-bats everyone keep bitching about not dropping good loot.
---
So, real life? Or am I doing this "life" thing wrong?
---
Particularly as a new player, they toss atoms at you like crazy for the first 50 levels or so, just because there are so many one time challenges that aren‚Äôt hard to earn you‚Äôll earn them by accident. 
---
And now that the store is a bit more fleshed our, you won‚Äôt blow them all on Pip-Boy skins and a cowboy outfit... unless that‚Äôs what you want lol
---
Can't say..   But hopefully soon.     
---
Two shot weapons?  
---
People have reported using hip shot reducing upgrades to reduce the miss percentages. 
---
More than a couple, but not the entire community..  
---
Believe what you want, be angry if you want to,
---
I'm frustrated more isn't fixed, but I'm going to try and help for now.
---
Interesting, can't wait.
---
You can't buy it directly. It says that the coat is a gift for purchasing atoms directly from the atomic shop.
---
Yes. Like you wont get + melee damage from str etc.
---
Dear bethesda I've encountered a issues where my character wouldn't attack when I change my weapons in pipboy and I need to un-equip and re-equip my melee weapons again from my testing it only happens to melee weapons pls fix this issue thanks
---
damn you don't even use vats and somehow you managed to make me look like a fool :)
---
As for cheaters, if the game gets more competitive, there will be more cheaters. There's no escaping that.
---
Yes i have a feeling thats what they are doing. It makes sense to me at least. Gotta go to work have a nice day.
---
Oh okay, good to know. Thanks!
---
Finally found one at the tea pot.
---
I‚Äôm sure those who care sufficiently can come up with a solid-enough retcon...
---
Can confirm. I found my 3/5 in Fort Defiance looking for rare outfits. Green and metal containers.
---
Ok thanks for responding and u too!
---
Ha Ha! (Points finger)
---
Don't expect to have these weapons to have as many mods as the most modable weapons in the game but a lot of these indeed seen rather lacking with mods. 
---
Hope to see them come during Nuclear Winter and/or Wastelanders.
---
Yeah but soon it will be
---
That's why all my serums are 300 or less, if you're on xbox, stop by my camp!
---
I think its kinda what this game deserves and those who play it. Yes, Its not fun but you look at the damage that fo76 did to the overall gaming industry and how Bethesda kept lying and trying to scam the community.   
---
no self respecting customer would give fallout 76 a chance after the year 1 fiasco.   
---
And it will take a LONG time for people to trust Bethesda again because of how they treated the community and how they treated their own game.
---
Happy to do what I can and thanks for taking the time to comment..  
---
If we want it to be worthy we've got to work to constructively hold them accountable..
---
I have 3 extra broken prosnap deluxes if you want one
---
I did when i started at launch lol. I was so pissed i tossed my controller and was like, "Maaaaaan fuck this!" and pouted lolol. Fiance was like, "Are you for fuckin real?"
---
Was funny we both started laughing. Hated that thing for a good 10 seconds though.
---
THE SPACE STATION IS GETTING CONTENT THANK GOD 
---
I‚Äôm so proud of how this game‚Äôs character arc is going. The first thing the Beth panel did was apologise, and then leading with this honestly made me not even mad about BR. I genuinely am excited to try that. You did good folks.
---
Now ask the Wolfenstein team why they just re-announced the games we already knew about.
---
I guess I'll go search for this list among pages I've already seen, as mentioned, lol.
---
Quality community, back to real fallout I go.
---
How would you define a "proper fallout game?"
---
A lot. Lol
---
Interesting. Wonder if a whole team can each have a companion. Wander around in our own little gang.
---
Probably 10-11am est. That's when most updates/maintenance go live.
---
They mentioned that they were looking at the idea of ladder seasons where you start over from scratch which would be amazing
---
Yeah I wish any of us knew! They should have had the trial go live right after the press conference. How hard would that have been?
---
If the Titanic had hit bottom and still managed to return to the surface, I suspect it would still be regarded as a disaster, it was a ship, not a submarine. OK, I'm being maybe too serious/literal with your comment, I'm just going to leave quietly. Sorry.
---
Events are a good way (sheepsquash, uranium fever, sBQ...).
---
also all big interior zones have high chance of having at least one legendary in it, sometimes more that one
---
The challenges to actually obtain the backpack aren't tedious at all, you can finish them in an afternoon.
---
The rest of the pioneer badges are tedious because you're supposed to earn them in time while doing other stuff. 
---
For the backpack you only need two badges out of like 20
---
Im guessing Nuclear Winter will be another tab in the selection screen to join into like Adventure or Survival. Or like in the trailer you can join the Nuclear Winter matchmaking by visiting Vault 51 entrance.
---
The Wastelanders DLC coming in the fall will include the NPC's and continuation of the Main Quest. and hopefully, a lot of new sidequests.
---
juicehead criticism is respected, he is always talking about fallout and skyrim games, while sometimes i disagree with him in some topics that i feel he doesn't know the behind the scene from a developer side that much, he was one of the few saying that there is a huge communication problem in beth. he would never use the angry vault boy thumbnails and create a millon video review of hate and then move on... those youtubers speaks to the hatters
---
Don't like it, don't buy it. I've seen many very reasonably priced legendaries at significantly lower prices, even very good one. They will realize that if nobody is buying the wares, it's a time to reconsider the prices.
---
I am not sure, but the game will probably need a patch before... I don't think Nuclear Winter is in the current game files
---
Awesome, thank you. Been enjoying fallout 76 again and just trying to farm some legends.. Been too busy making a base and being a cook lol
---
I just hope I don't need to make love to any person to get a bonus üòÄ
---
I was ready to make a post about that. :P I would like to know that too.. They said 10 jun but in Europe is already 10 jun.
---
Uranium fever has small chance to drop it.
---
Here is topic with more info about underarmour
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a40ifp/questions\_underarmor\_and\_linings/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a40ifp/questions_underarmor_and_linings/)
---
My jimmies are ready to whack it!
---
I realize how that sounds, and I'm Ok with it.
---
I guess so; gonna probably record those matches and see if I can weed any of them out. I can already surmise that some mods Ive seen on nexus (glowing piles and such) can grant unfair advantage; would be nice if Beth can step up the game and look into it.
---
Fuck everyone who invested in one of Fallout's core mechanics, I guess.
---
Psn is brm138. Won‚Äôt be on for a couple hours though
---
Still a no, it isn't worth it.
---
This is just my thought. It could start in 8 ish hours when stuff usually goes down for maintenance.
---
I think all of us in this sub know the pain of getting those backpacks by now...
---
My advice is too look for some cheat sheets spread accross this sub (they can tell u locations too complete certain challenges easy or have the answers for the exams) and go do the new campfire tales even whenever u have the time. The easiest ones too do for me was the archery (just smack low level enemies with ur Crowe bow and u can get kills and lower the durability for repairs without needing too craft ammo) the hacker one (just go too the energy plants around the map they have many locked terminals). I don‚Äôt remember what the other two were that I did as they were much harder but with all the cheat sheets and stuff it‚Äôs getting easier.
---
If it‚Äôs more of a question of ‚Äúis it worth spending so much time running around doing these quests for this backpack‚Äù well my answer is ‚ÄúHELL YEA!‚Äù I don‚Äôt even have the high capacity mod for my backpack (doubles the extra carry weight) and I can run around without power armor on and have 140 carry weight too spare. Of course I have deep pocketed on my armor and perk cards too lower carry weights for ammo, my heavy guns and armor. But it is overall the most handy thing I‚Äôve ever had. In fact if I had that high capacity mod I would have over 200 spare carry weight all the time.
---
this is your brain on reddit
---
The nuclear wildfire is rather early. Because OP just got fifth degree burn.
---
Yes  unyielding Combat armor/Marine is awesome
---
But keep in mind you will still need Power Armor in blast zones
---
I've never seen anyone call for a BR mode. The BR ship has sailed already tbh, frankly it seems like sad trench chasing. There are so many better things to work on in Fallout 76.
---
Agreed. I hate being chased down for the points I get for just playing the game. I preferred it when the scored board tracked only kills that way people who want to pvp could pvp. But as you said now all you have to do is play the game and you get put on the score board.
---
there is a sale in the atomic shop that is over in about 2 and a half hours, at that point they will likely start the update. the downtime is usually about 2 hours. give or take 30 minutes or so. so in roughly 4-5 hours you should be able to play nuclear winter
---
It's not available yet.
---
you can ride one for 5,000,000 caps
---
 Whoooooooooohoooooooooo

Yes of course we do. I have a friend who spends his time in 4chan, and his views are mostly influenced by the views or those circlejerkers, I invited him to play F76 for the free week and if he likes it I'll buy it. But I know he won't like it because he keeps saying the same things you'd expect to hear in 4chan and twitter posts "paid to be a beta tester" "76 and rpg are words that don't go together" "dupster fire". Even tho I'm his friend and he should hear my honest judgment after playing the game for 400 hours, he still gets influenced by the circlejerkers in 4chan. You just can't make people think for themselves, they all just read what others say and keep saying the same shit no matter if it's true or not.
---
So yeah, I get tons of backlash for playing and liking a good game.
---
The chainsaw needs buffing. The flamer added makes no difference. It would be nice to be able to use it effectively against higher level enemies than lvl 22 scorched and ghouls.
---
Basically make it the Doom Slayer‚Äôs, right.
---
The trailer seemed to suggest picking sides between raiders and non-raiders is a thing now.
---
Space station is probably a ‚Äúgood‚Äù hub. And I bet too of the world will be the raider hub.
---
just go to some camp and start to hit something until they realize, we are not a killing charity group
---
Fixed. Thanks. Guess it's been some time since I've played FO76..
---
I loved this game from the start. My love will continue and increase tenfold with these updates. BR actually looks fun I cannot believe it. And Wastelanders... my god. Thrilled.
---
West-Tek, AWOL Armaments, Free Range and Horde Events.
---
It was always planned. They said the game was built to have a long life. As we saw from the trailer the "Year 2" tag line. meaning we will see many upon many changes as the game progresses, you can't naturally add everything at the same time, people will eat that up and complain about the lack of content (which they already do) even though it isn't really true. I'm just happy that the dungeons are in, NPC's coming in, The Main Quest continuation is coming. I would say im looking forward to seeing fewer people complain, but we all know that bitching will always be a thing in communities. Right now the main thing I want to be added is Spawn point mats for camps and another stash increase for me to sell some more stuff in my vending machines.
---
Did you forget the state of 3 and NV when they released?
---
Let's be honest, it's not about "*unfinished*" with you.  It's about the game not being what you *think* you *deserve* just because you bought their other games.
---
VATS will work against everything except other players.
---
Valid point.  
---
Bethesda is on record mentioning many studios are involved in working on '76 (reinforcing the hypothesis) and it does make sense for clarity and continuity to have a group of "Specalists"
---
Oh damn you‚Äôre right, I didn‚Äôt think about that ü§î
---
Ty for posting, I am already aware of this post, but still usefull as it may help others. 
---
(I created alt, to atempt (some post mentioned it) high % chance on raider missions. Prerequisite was low level and purchased l;ining 1-2-3. Nothing. Then just used it to grind on Uranium Fewer. Well .. alt passed level 50 already and guest what .. got only raider plans 1-2-3 I purchased when I reached top of the world as level 10 .....)
---
&gt; They can't damage people with pacifist on.
---
That's not how pacifist works.  If you have pacifist on *you* can't damage people.
---
As I was reminded when I got a great headshot on a wanted player only to see the "you can't hurt players with pacifist on" pop up.  Drat.
---
Thank God I work while there is downtime lol
---
it depends, most of the high level players are on a hoop server party Hunting legendaries for events and move on to the next one, the there is me with  lv150 and just searching for magazines and farming steel for my .50cal lol
---
but im on pc
---
Everyone sleeps on the Flooded Train Yard, I‚Äôm telling you! I get consistent 2 3* legendaries there.
---
Or get tricked onto a team who start a "fight" with their friends so you are pulled into PvP against your will.
---
As long as the Battle Royale "event" is optional, and/or only in Survival Mode.  
---
Sticking with Adventure Mode always. NPS's though! Wow! Unexpected.
---
Agree. Maybe in the forest area, which can't be nuked
---
Nah, I will probably hunt them who that have bounty on his/her head.
---
Do get me wrong BioWare messed it up initially but I was saying the fixing of it after launch was on EA for not letting them. That‚Äôs what I thought happened.
---
Tempted to wear one and run around accusing people of being synths, blaming everything on synths, and yelling out "SYNNNNNNNTHHHSSSS!" ala KHAAAAAN!
---
Honestly, the jump, wall, shoot, jump, wall, shoot is dumb as fuck. I'm sure fo76 BR can be decent without the ability to do magical walls.
---
If anything, thank god it doesn't work like fortnite.
---
Is that an event or location?
---
Dialogue trees and roleplaying?
---
I will throw my name in here as well. PSN = Brizix I only work weekends over night and I play a ton hit me up if you need help with anything.
---
Note - Not trying to steal your thunder heroic just offering more help to new players. I love the game despite its flaws and would love to help more people see the fun.
---
They were nerfed but not enough. Tse still one shot almost everything. I have maxed out fireproof and a dense torso mod and I still get one shot sometimes. It definitely helps tho.
---
I can‚Äôt wait to run from it
---
Right down by Watoga station. If you‚Äôve never been there you‚Äôll get a misc quest that says ‚Äúclear the enemies of the Flooded Train Yard‚Äù when you discover it.
---
Summer body!
---
What's your build? I can suggest a better levelling strategy based on your build and equipment.
---
on now.
---
It doesn't really work that way for a few reasons.
---
1. There's no temporary trade option in the game that allows other players to modify or fix gear for you.
---
2. Everyone can and eventually does get the separate cards that improve your repair ability on armor and weapons. They're able to switch those cards out at any time provided they have enough points to do so.
---
3. People don't really talk as much to one another and when it comes to fixing things early on, people tend to do it themselves.
---
4. Contrary to the poster you see in the vault about picking a career, there is no real economy in that sense to where people can help one another with actual skills choosing branches like Medical, Engineering, Cooking, Research, or Fighting.
---
This game had so much potential to have people commit to builds and give them real incentive to team up to help one another out but everyone can do practically everything which eliminates any real individuality or need to work together on anything that's not an end game boss. As long as you have 3 points in Perception or 3 Points in Intelligence then anyone can grab the perk cards to hack or lock pick anything.
---
Should be fun. Im gonna see how it plays.
---
A good chunk of the issues are carried over from Fallout 4, and many of the fixes were implemented in various unofficial patches.  
---
That work is established and tested.  
---
Adding missing attachpoint keywords (for example on wood armor, which is still broken, or the plasma gun, one of the first things I reported) should not have any impact other than to resolve the current problem linked to that.  
---
Adding a missing Constuctible (COBJ), especially if cloned from an existing record also has at most limited impact...   
---
Many Quests, world space edits, NPC issues with Animations (the occasionally broken ghouls that "surf" the ground while laying down".. Etc..   
---
Those are much more involved and can have far reaching ramifications...  
---
I am armchair quarterbacking here, but I've done some of the work, worked on and created content for FO4, so instead of being the drunken lout yelling at his TV, who didn't even play Highschool football, I'm the guy who made it on the college team but washed out after bombing his second year, I'm still an armature, but known enough to be dangerous.
---
If that's all then that's what you'll be getting soon so no worries right mate?
---
Bethesda Studios wants to know your location
---
oh hell yeah i've been running a grenade melee build and more explosives are always welcomed
---

Where did you hear building not requiring materials? I though we were still gonna have to loot for resources to build.
---
I was seriously concerned that FO76 would be online, but the majority of other players are friendly, with the occasional keyboard warrior pounding their chest, I do play other games in addition to FO76, AC Odyssey currently, but I always come back to Fallout 76, to check in and explore a little.  
---
I never wanted a refund for FO76, never understood why anyone wanted one, but yes it's not perfect, but nothing is.  
---
The new content coming does look amazing though.
---
You do understand that the answer changes over time.... right?
---
What.
---
Some players take it personally just today I killed a level 30 player as he is a wanted player then he respawn back and ask me why I killed him .
---
I said you are wanted and he went on to said "well I dont care if I'm wanted or not " but then he take it personally and started to challenged me to PVP I ignored him and then he keeps following me around and attacked me
---
How about a little memorial video? Your camp looks real good!
---
You don't have your perk card in NW so you can't use your VATS build anyway
---
From what I've read (subject to change), Wastelanders and/or Nuclear Winter will be seperate Game Modes (like Survival and Adventure), so there's a chance the stories could be separated too.
---
A lot of Marty Robbins songs would be a perfect addition to the Fallout radio, but if I were to choose one, Ain't I right gets my vote.
---
It's the perfect extremely exaggerated, self-praising, anti-communism, propaganda-ish song, it sounds like it could have been written by Liberty Prime himself.
---
CSGO, the timelessly good multiplayer game
---
Thanks for sharing. This actually looks good. For $10 you get 1500 atoms+ the Elder coat. Finally buying atoms makes sense
---
I think they should just straight up ban mods and only allow creation club. People are blinded by benefits of cosmetic mods that they are not seeing shady those modders all readied up to ruin the fairness of the game. Well that went down the gutter long time ago but still :P
---
Thank you, imma check it out
---
16x the whining from you.
---
by atom, i can‚Äòt wait. my favorite endgame plasma rifle ~&lt;3
---
You'll get the base quests, but there have been changes from launch that are going to make it a somewhat different experience than it was for us who played in the beta or at launch. Player vending and events like the Fasnacht parade have made FO76 somewhat more social, although you can still avoid others if that's your thing.
---
Going to respectfully disagree here, I think it was intended.   
---
Some of the early outrage about there being no NPC's was inflamed further when we (the community) got access to the game files and found there was evidence of speaking, intractable NPCs that weren't in the game, the fact they could have been drove people nuts. 
---
I do agree that the exploration is key, and I've said more or less the same thing over and over, if you listen to the voice acting it's fantastic, and there are countless little scenes, many in no way related to the storyline quest, that the heartbreaking if you stop looting long enough to "see" them..  
---
As there will likely be exactly that, if survival mode is any indication, you'll likely sample it atleast once..
---
That is very helpful, thank you!
---
The Atom Shop looks like it resets at 8:00am EST.  Hopefully we will see the "E3 Atom Bonus Bundle" at that time.
---
The Mechanist would like a word with you (probably)...
---
I don't think the rust devils would have been the only ones to think of the idea, in one of the earlier (non-canon?) games, theres a faction of raiders that worship technology (no, not the BoS), but I don't remember the name.
---
Completely agree, plus it‚Äôs a game that allows you to be friendly. Unlimited resources everywhere.
---
I keep wondering this myself, what is this 'nothing' I keep selecting?
---
Why does the UI keep reminding me that I have in fact selecting nothing?
---
Why is 'nothing' uncannily similar to 'something'? Are they twins?
---
What does it all mean?
---
You know, that would be an awesome set of mods...  
---
I mean just redoing the existing radio with new tracks..
---
Berry mentats.  Unless you're paying someone to take out your target, in which case grape mentats could work.
---
Even better when you do trade them they request your best weapon. Think that might be my main weapon chief? 
---
I have a crit commando toon and carry 2 guns. You think that MAYBE I use those guns?
---
I really hope they let you build them like a power armor suit or something.  Different parts, different mods, and different models would be pretty sick.
---
Nuclear Winter aka Battle Royale is useless to people from Australia because you don't have servers in Australia. We're all stuck on laggy USA servers...and yes I can prove it.
---
It's okay. You like singleplayer games and this is not a singleplayer game.
---
Unsub and wait until the next Fallout game playing something else.
---
Right - which is awesome. But it‚Äôs a typically odd selling point. Imagine a game being announced now and one of their features was ‚Äúhaving NPC‚Äôs‚Äù.
---
I call the big one "Bitey"
---
If they get rid of survival, il probably get rid of fallout. I had already quit playing for a couple mo ths before they released it
---
You should say your platform. Any particular reason why you want to power level?
---
Before my time (FO4 was my first Bethesda game and my first Fallout since 1/2). 
---
Thanks for the recognition and keep on cleaning up the countryside!
---
Yay!, hopefully, I can finally have Dog walking around with me...hopefully.
---
Sure, but only if you can't carry your stuff back into Adventure mode.
---
Yup, that would be ideal. Also some form of anticheat measures and proactive staff dedicated to finding and banning such cheaters, like in Fortnite, CSGO or Division... A man can dream.  
---
We'll see how it fares, but I'm definitely on the optimistic side (hence my post) :)) Won't let ruin my enjoyment by any douchy cheaters.
---
Ahhh sorry I‚Äôm PS4 and I want to power level as my friend is level 50 and he plays on alternating weeks and can‚Äôt play a lot to help me level and I would like to catch up to him.
---
I just checked all my 4 mule accounts - i was lvling it only with uranium fever event from lvl 4 to lvl 25 - they don't have first 2 plans learned, here are plans they got
---
first acc - nothing
---
second acc - resistant x1
---
third acc - resistant  x1
---
fourth acc - protective x 1 , shielded x 1 
---
so 4th account is strangest - like i said before all of them dont have first 2 tiers learned
---
Pvp is all about perks and gear really. Nk everyone is completely equal at the start of the match.
---
Well since both the Mechanist and the Rust Devils appeared around 2287 I don't see that happening in 2102
---
Well, that's a wrap.  u/giantpunda wins this one.
---
That's been patched. Rip fast dragon reload.
---
My hope about the system is that the overseer rank system is a straight progression like the regular level up in adventure mode and you don't have to pull off any number of ridiculous feats just to move up a level. Fortnite let's you work through the levels nicely even if you're having a string of bad luck and getting few, if any, kills.
---
So more like earn extra XP the longer you survive and less take pictures of 51 different players then kill them to unlock this power armour skin.
---
Look up Captainoob‚Äôs Stealth Commando build on YouTube. It‚Äôs easily the best rifleman build, minus PVP.
---
Bethesda might do what they did with the BOS canon.
---
Because they view the population that was flagged for duping as expendable, and not worth the time or resources to get them back to playing.
---
There is a Respec option. When leveling up after lvl 50 you can either respec a point to a different SPECIAL or get a perk card
---
Tech issues for sure, and not much of a story, true.  And yet some of still find it fun to play, not garbage.   ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
lol yeah god/dog was great
---
OK. This is .. something. Something I can work on, thank you.
---
well, it's stated that this will be a "pre-beta" experience so I don't expect it to be stable nor polished
---
Its not a new concept... check out Guild Wars 2, Star Wars the old republic, elder scrolls online, pretty much any MMO.
---
 Even have a in game talk show (Random Encounters), across all platforms. Reach out to us, becouse all we want is to help YOU.  
---
No sole, like Sole Survivor. OP did say that he role-played the game, so it's only respectful to address him with his title /s
---
Neither does Hellfire armour - however Bethesda dont really seem to care haha
---
Ok maybe I wasn't clear. I'm thinking more of a borderlands style instant full respec mechanism where you pay for it with in game currency. The existing mechanism requires a LOT more grinding, especially if you're looking for a complete rebuild instead of minor tweaks
---
as I stated in another comment, they already said is a "pre-beta" experience so we can't say they didn't warn us
---
Bye, have a great time!
---
There are certain plants that you can pick and replant in your camp. Things like corn, mutfruit, tatos, melons, blackberrys, gourds, and razor grain. 
---
Pick these, plant them, go out and adventure or get other supplies, return later and after they've born produce you can pick those and then use your cooking station to cook up food that not only is disease free but satisfies more hunger, gives you temporary buffs, and can heal you partially.
---
One word of caution though, food tends to spoil quite quickly in this game. I suggest for a first timer for early levels at least pick up three levels in Luck and 3 levels in the Luck Perk called, "Good with Salt" this will drastically allow you to save food on your person that you intend to cook later and properly cooked food that you want to save for later.
---
Another note, any perk card that apply to item weight or that help with aspects like food spoilage like "Good with Salt" will only apply to items in your inventory and not items that you out away in your stash.
---
Or, it was part of their year two plan from the beginning.
---
I did an event in Watoga Civic Center (cop a squatter).  If that's the future of events I don't like the future.  The place is hell to navigate in.
---
Hah, I remember getting downvotes for replying to one of the many "theres no NPCs!" posts by pointing out "theres no \*human\* NPCs."  But it's totally true.
---
I think it's because, due to the Fallout pedigree, people equate "NPC" with "interactive dialog system".  But even then, there are robots in the game already that have that, to some degree.
---
 Settlers? That means settlements? Someone call Preston Garvey. There will be settlements that need out help!
---
And I'll happily oblige. In a true Miniteman way! The American way!
---
I want Eyebots!
---
Kinda weird. I have not had any crashes at all and i play at peak hours. I only have problems looting sbq and the Enryptid Event which sucks. But the server stability have been improved slot since launch!
---
Rebuild America. Right here, right now!
---
I'm not a new player, but I played for like 2 weeks at launch didn't quite get to Lv 20 but would love to team up with some people and get back on board.
---
I'll be on PC UK time with mic
---
Beth ID: DamoWoo
---
Your not wrong. Its not pvp blown to extream. Its survival. If they remove the leaderboard its almost perfect. Higher rewards higher danger.
---
You will not find love here as most players are singleplayer that have a hard time in the world as it is.
---
Yes, thank you. I would even spend my scrip currency to respec.
---
I highly doubt it. The BOS canon in fo76 is possible because of the tecnology to have long-distance comms. The rust devils, albeit smart, are just raiders. They have no interest in having a branch everywhere like the BOS does. 
---
There might be raider gangs that use technology and robots but I highly doubt they'll be Rust Devils per se
---
It was more an aswer to the people that say
---
"Fallout 76 is wrong, Bethesda is adding things because they are not ready at the start"
---
"We had to have shops and NPCs at the start"
---
etc...
---
I admit however that I have no experience with other MMO
---
Yeah agree
---
He‚Äôs married sorry
---
I'm a bit late to the party on discussing a problem with the Ever Upwards quest line, but here's a link to a previous post of mine regarding a quest-breaking bug [on XBOX, at least.] I thought I'd throw it your way for visibility's sake. I've notified Bethesda and sent a follow-up to let them know it remains broken (though, creating a new character is probably all that can be done now to side-step the issue.)
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bo2r45/order_of_the_tadpole_quest_bug_kiddie_korner/
---
TLDR: Prior to Patch 9.0, a prompt to "Investigate sounds at Camp Adams" popped up for a few players. Going to the scout camp kicked off the next set of quest requirements but none of the related NPCs were in-world yet to provide dialogue and gear. The quest disappeared upon logging off. Following 9.0, the quest returned at that stage, the Scout master at the camp would not provide plans/outfits (because the game maybe thinks it already did so?) and Operation Tidy could not be completed (though all other Possum objectives could be.)
---
I tried a few things to work around it (like joining a team, server hopping, checking the CAMP terminal, etc) but no success yet. Thanks for all the work you've done with helping the community keep track of all these loose threads!
---
You know you'll be able to buy companion skins for atoms right? It's practically given
---
Yup, you don't know what you are talking about. They never actually used any others code, here you go: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m69Kipt3ThE
---
Before i made lvling for another  4 accounts - all of them have learned first 2 tiers - got only protective plans, i learned them for unlock shielded but what i saw there was no shielded plan found, they were lvled from 20 lvl to 40-50 lvl only with uranium fewer, i have it fully automated with ahk script so there was plenty done. i will make some screenschots with all plans they got for comparing. just give me sec
---
I know I‚Äôm dumb but on jukes and dragons roadmap it says stuff like +1 from prev level what that mean?
---
Suckering yourself.
---
Glad to see someone else hyped for it too! Looks really tight don't it? The reworking to nukes and the literal ring of fire looks like one of the most cinematic experiences ever pulled off in Fallout. I'm excited to toss away the TSEs for once too and still be on an even playing field.
---
100% this!! She is so fucking annoying!
---
What's the point of skills if you can just change them. Oh I need to be a heavy gunner. Let me change all my perks and cards. Tadaaa. Now my minigun will be effective. Oh now I need to sell some stuff. Better change all my skills into Charisma.  
---
And besides that. You already have a lot of freedom with exchanging cards here and there.  
---
Plan your character a little bit. Decide what kind of character you wanna be and stick to it. For another kind of character, start a new playtrough (Like how it has always been in the Fallout games).
---
The best place to get wood early on are the lumber mills that you'll find on the way to the Overseer's camp from the Vault. If you look for the logging company art on your map then you should see the rough areas where you can get a lot more wood compared to searching for it.
---
For water, I suggest trying to get a water purifier as soon as possible. You can get some here and there from different activities like claiming a workshop or finding them from Overseers Stashes. (If you check out the Army Bootcamp to the East of the first town you get in I think you'll find a plan for one in a stash)
---
Also make it where you can harvest wood from trees with chainsaws.
---
That's a decent reason. I'm on PC so I can only offer advice. Fully explore the Ash Heap of you haven't (finding new places is easy xp), and start plinking at enemies in the western edge of the savage divide, like the raider camps around the Top of the World. I'm sure you'll find someone to run with you.
---
Doing Appalachia a favor
---
That isn't how downvote bots work. They don't just downvote some in the sub, they downvote indiscriminately.
---
Alright thank you, really appreciate the help.
---
In a wasteland I imagine it'd be hard to find companions
---
Yea i know lol
---
This is not a singleplayer game, never was and never was meant to be.
---
This is a multiplayer game, did you think it wasnt?
---
It would be unfair if you couldnt play it, its not because you just dont want to.
---
Ok this is a long one..   
---
Unofficial Rep from the Unofficial Roundups, I guess it's fitting..  
---
But seriously I don't know how much of a rep I am / will be, but I'll keep fighting the good fight.  
---
-Personally opinion and trying to not alienate myself and ruin the progress with BGS..  
---
It would be a breakdown in communication with the community, lack of transparency and "accuracy" early on and insufficient beta time.   
---
I think they needed harsher, more power-gaming testers, people who deliberately push the envelope and excel at finding loopholes.  
---
-Part of the fixes (IMHO) are bandaids until they can circle back, with a finite amount of resources, hours in the day and staff, do you focus on a quick but "adequate" fix or the more involved but technically correct one?  
---
Having been faced with this quandary professional it's case by case, but the Ultrawide issues drive me nuts.  
---
The camp bit I think is another good enough, but could be better, especially because I don't know how resource intensive it would be to do a "check" before joining the world. 
---
-Minor vs Major often depends on if it's something "you" desperately want..  
---
Both however are evidence they are listening to the community, I know more than a couple people who only wear PA because they can't stand accidentally sitting down in the middle of combat because of a rogue click.  
---
I'm not going to claim to know about the resource or competence levels of all of BGS, but they have to have some skill right? ;).  
---
But seriously I think many of our bugs stem from using a base that didn't have all of the old issues resolved (which may or may not have been known) and a "Pattern Blindness" issue.  
---
If you work with the same thing long enough your brain starts to auto fill what you expect to see, resulting in you quite literally looking at but not seeing things, this is exceptionally common with big projects..  
---
As for the last bit, too early for me to hazard a guess, but time will ultimately show us..
---
Commitment is scary to some
---
They fixed explosives on shotguns.
---
This is what I personally expected from Wastelanders, not a recycled Nuka-World Story.
---
Guess Bethesda didn't get my Warm Piss comment after all...
---
Will just have to wait and see then, because my bet is they weren't running it on the server architecure that the servers we play on run on, as they are still struggling with the servers with only 24 players.
---
Hopefully I'm wrong, but I just cn't see them having fixed the issues with the servers for the BR without also having been able to fix the servers handling of 24 players.
---
:(
---
You've got months to prepare.
---
Are you good at pvp ?
---
Right? It‚Äôs literally a baked in aimbot ffs lol
---
I'm looking forward to getting back into the game. My wife bought it for me on release day and I've played it maybe 2 hours.  At the time, I was so frustrated with how much different it was from past Fallout games the bugs seemed unbearable and I just couldn't bring myself to care about playing anymore.  I had decided that the game was crap and wasn't worth it.  After seeing the E3 update and reading about the stability improvements, definitely going to be getting back out there.
---
It‚Äôs the Inferno Mark
---
ü§û
---
Why won't they? Didn't you watch the same e3 trailer as I did? They clearly had gear from adventure mode, such as the hellifre PA and the built CAMPs.
---
No. First you should make sure it won't be radroach, bloatfly or other low-level one-hit bug, because it's miracle it survived to actually face the alpha. Secondly it usually random where the alpha spawns - many times we have no problem keeping animal alive, since alpha spawned in other room and before friendly animal get to alpha, we were able to kill it. Other times, when alpha spawns in the same room as friendly animal you can only try to block him way towards the alpha hoping you'll able to kill alpha before it kill animal.
---
Havent really tried that much so i wouldnt know
---
This is the thing I'm not sure people pick up on about these kind of 'Games as a Service': **the whole goddamn game is planned out from day one.**
---
Yes, there will be a few deviations, a lot of bug fixes and a few other things thrown into the mix along the way, but everything you see in terms of major updates, content, gear, story... ALL of that was on the table right when the game launched. It might not have been in a playable state, but it was there.
---
You don't just drop a game, say you're going to 'support it' for years and then say, "Well, we'd better think up a few ideas for what we're going to do after we dropped this fully featured and entirely complete game!"
---
You chop the whole game into little pieces and then release them bit by bit over time in order to keep the interest of the players and you need to keep the interest of the players so they keep buying things from your microtransaction cash shop and **that** is the whole reason Fallout 76 exists.
---
I'm not panning the game in any way by saying this - it's just literally why 76 was made; in order to give Bethesda a slow trickle of steady income in the absence of any new ways to re-release Skyrim.
---
It actually adds three effects. Better sneak, faster movement while sneaking, greatly reduced weight.
---
lol, 200 for a level 5 item. very nice of you
---
Atleast one map per region would be nice
---
Point(s) of technicality.....     
---
-If you read my post/comment history I bought the PA edition from the BethesdaGear store like newb and paid like $255 or something insane like that, so give me some credit.    
---
-Never felt robbed, especially after hour 300, that's less than a $1 per hour of entertainment.   
---
-I did demand explanations, but it was for bugs, the code ones, not the creepy crawly ones.  
---
-Well, ummm they are people, thankfully robots haven't taken that job yet.
---
But we don't know how much points into charisma will be necessary at point. Preparation time won't help if we don't know what we're aiming for. The only alternative I can think of is to grind like hell until you're sitting on a bank of respec points enough to do a respec and then pray that you don't screw it up and over compensate the first time. If that happens then it's back to the grind train
---
I haven‚Äôt seen a single person that doesn‚Äôt hate the way it works atm so hopefully they figure it out soon.
---
did you say atoms?
---
Raiders unite
---
If that were true the numbers would be higher and there would be less trash junk and only high grade junk.
---
That would render the current respec system useless. It only takes 15 levels to fully respec into one of the SPECIALS. While I agree there should be a full respec option for full character changes it should come with a penalty. Like being able to do it only once per character, or losing all your perk cards and getting random new ones depending on what you put your points in
---
I think the biggest thing regarding anything for this game is to just wait and see how it plays out. A lot of people just shat all over everything but then after it comes out you don't really hear too much. I am not a battle royale person. I have never played one and there's a reason for that period however I'll be willing to give it a shot. I have a solid group of people who I play with who are also of the same mind when it comes to it but I'm not gonna sit here in the complain when I don't even know what it is yet. We're getting our 1st look today so my tune may change tomorrow but I'll at  least give it a shot! At the very least waste Landers looks like it's going to be a game changer!
---
Looks like it‚Äôll just be cosmetics, xp and caps from the article
---
I am wondering that as well, I thought it would be great because I have today off. But if we have to wait for the server maintenance it will be 4-5 pm in Europe  :-/
---
One of my characters is definitely siding with raiders and I hope I get to kill Rose too.
---
What does that have to do with a company staying dedicated to supporting their games? Just because they are different studios doesn't mean we should expect the parent company, Bethesda, to treat the game differently in terms of support.
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed and your post has been removed.
---
You‚Äôre only ‚Äúnice‚Äù in-game to make up for the fact that you‚Äôre probably an asshole IRL like the rest of these ‚Äúwe are one Appalachia‚Äù fakes.
---
Blocking the friendly animal works well too, he just got out of pocket at the end.  The alpha spawned in the same room we were and the bloatfly decided to go at him to get a lick in so he could get a legendary armor lol
---
That's not accurate. It *was* Bethesda Austin, Montreal, and Dallas initially.
---
The current system isn't great in the first place in my opinion. I normally wouldn't complain about it, but from I can tell we're about to be hit  with an update that alters a fundamental aspect of how we approach character building in this game. For some builds this means going back to the drawing board. I don't mind paying a penalty, I just wish the option is there
---
They didn't indicate the time. Just waiting on the 10th
---
I thought it was just Austin
---
It happened once to me to be assaulted by a gang of 5 mirelurk kings in the cranberry bog. What an awful fight. I hated all 5 of them.
---
Yeah he‚Äôs saying that one game having a ring of Fire means they all have a ring of Fire despite literally every other br having something different lmao
---
Player vendors are the best place to find weapons and stuff.
---
I hope they reintroduce the incinerator mod for the flamer.
---
I actually made a post about this awhile back with a proposed solution for both PC and console. Unfortunately, I haven't seen anything come of it yet. 
---

The only thing I can genuinely suggest that might work here and there is the create the initial wire and stop right after that for a few seconds. Don't move the mouse, just keep looking at the first object for 2-4 seconds. Then take the wire over and try to connect it to the other object you wish to connect the wire to.
---
It works sometimes for me and other times I'm back to jumping. Hopefully this will help you with connecting cables.
---
It would probably be the best cap sink
---
I'm glad they took the time to do this, they lost face recently, with me and alot of the community too it seems. I have just returned from a break since the launch of the game, new char working my way up. They experience feels alot smoother and generally less buggy. Now with the confrerence and this, the future is looking better for Bethesda. I hope they carry on down that path and can earn back what they have lost.
---
i'm glad theres others with the same mindset, i didn't care for it, just like "ah crap..." but the demo starts today? doesn't it? you know if theres any prereqs, or anything like that?
---
While I see where you're coming from, Wastelanders won't be launched for months. There is plenty of time to respec. On the other hand I would also like a way to fully change my character but as I said, if they implement such an option it has to be very expensive, otherwise it will be abused.
---
Start with the downvotes but i actually LOVED playing in the BETA when everyone was poor and we had nothing. The whole joy of being powerful now comes from being weak and having nothing and no one.
---
I have only gotten the plan once(uranium fever) in 700 hours of game time so i think its just pure luck.
---
I can‚Äôt wait to dread it
---
Yesssss, plasma caster is badass
---
Okay?
---
We at r/76raiders are really looking forward to this opening up the raider play style. It‚Äôs fairly limited atm.
---
Yongyea got another one üôÑ couple other youtubers come to mind as well
---
I need it. Let‚Äôs work it together
---
About to slap on my unyeilding set and beat the shit out of my self until the NPCs listen to me... not sure if its because my CHR is going up or they just want me to stop hurting myself in front of them.
---
As far as we know, no.
---
How does buying atoms directly on Ps4 work? It redirects to the playstation store whenever i press triangle to purchase atoms and there's only the regular offers still.
---
If you are talking about FNV, then you are right, my man...
---
I need a Deadpool jumpsuit
---
I think it's not live yet
---
Same here. Downloading right now on ps4. Saw some gameplay from someone at the beta and they weren't the friendliest. Has it evolved much since then? Was interested a bit in it before but the upcoming addition of npcs is most of the reason i bought it(and that it was on sale). Will be looking forward to playing it.
---
You welcome bro https://www.reddit.com/r/76Raiders?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
There‚Äôs YouTube videos. Try watching one. But: survival, repair kits, burrows, camera, arktos, survival, sheep quest line, player vending, no more PvP in adventure aside from workshops, no camp damage, turrets damage scaled to enemy player, no more two shot explosives, no more explosive energy/flame/cryo weapons. Two shot explosive fat man is still a thing though.
---
I'm hoping things turn out alright for Wastelanders though I'm a bit skeptical because besides choosing a faction I don't get what other actual choices and consequences we'll have in the game that other players will see. The whole point in Fallout games before was that you actually saw the consequences of your actions, that only works so well in a multiplayer environment though unless it's a small number of players in an RPG campaign.
---
I'm hoping the dialogue is genuine and not just a fancy menu of responses that all eventually lead to getting the same quest like in SWTOR.
---
That would be deleting everyone‚Äôs base and would piss off everyone that spent hours on those bases that now need to place everything all over again...
---
I already know which side I'm going to take.
---
What is your own?
---
i love this, cuz tod specificaly was like "we threw a bunch of strangers into a wasteland, and eveyrone's friendly!"
---
I thought I read somewhere that there were different mark versions (1-5) of the hellfire that you could craft. Could be just a varient on that.
---
So when exactly is Fallout 76 gonna be free to play for a week? I've checked on Bethesda's launcher just couple minutes ago and they still charge money for it.
---
I wrecked a level 112 enemy twice in survival on my level 11. You‚Äôll be fine. I have a video of it too.
---
My guess is that it's not worth since it's an  online game and your connection is pretty important.
---
It just popped into my head
---
I mean I run at average of 6mbps and i have no issues with the game at all, I think it's worth a shot
---
On the old road map nuclear winter says it's coming out this summer. Technical test or beta test is from the 10th to the 17th I think we will see a full release by next month. Then in the fall we are getting wastelanders which was the NPC add-on they talked about.
---
Sorry, PSN
---
You can always try!
---
Send a ticket to Bethesda. They‚Äôll hook you up.
---
9am
---
WELL.. I'M A TIGHTY WHITEY MAN I'M YOUNG AND I'M IN MY PRIME!
---
Beta player here, being we were given hours to play every 2 days for a certain amount of days, I can say that 7 days is plenty of time to get a first impression, also 4mbps is plenty to play, but that could be your download speed you are listing and not your upload, which is what is used during online play.
---
You can play Fallout 76 with 700Kbps, it has no ping/latency cap.
---
4Mbps would be enough to play any game regardless of whether it has a ping/latency cap.
---
Pardon for coming off blunt, rushing to get to work but wanted to write this out for you, cheers.
---
Oh I see. Thanks!
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôm excited to finally try this game out‚Äù *talked shit since BETA*
---
Yeah sure. I mean, it's not like they have any caps or good junk on them.
---
True but it isnt always about material wealth... some men just want to watch the world burn.
---
upload and download speeds vary, but Fallout76 has no ping/latency cap, so even someone with 700Kbps would be able to play albeit with some lag, if 6mbps is his listed upload speeds then that is plenty, and enough to play any online game out there, including Ubisoft games which are known to be strict on latency/ping times.
---
Was asking the same question, it's already 12:35pm in Germany.
---
Like everyone, the Bethesda team is made up of humans.
---
In that way they will have a thousand possible ideas, a thousand possible alternatives, as any creative team can have different ideas from the rest.
---
But these humans also have a marked development time in which to get the product and cover expenses.
---
But the road map was clear.
---
\-The game should come out quickly and is focused on the known story.
---
\-The engine allows to do a thousand different things besides all the known history of Fallout (although the engine makes waters everywhere XD).
---
\-They want to make a permanent game in time with micropayments (initially cosmetics, then perhaps for quality of life things like the repair kits).
---
\-Now they can add content to the existing modes, put more game modes, new stories and recycle all the content of previous games and new that they create among all the game modes that they take out.
---
While they are lucrative or have passion for what they do, they will continue adding things, even after 10 years ... although with this engine unfortunately I would wish them a shorter life ... and they will bring out a remaster with a new engine and more possibilities.
---
In short, they used a fairly difficult to process engine, few tests of their servers and made one of the worst presentations of a game of this kind possible XD.
---
We will always remember how you kept the vault entrance safe for us until the time came. For those who are about to forever lose their camp-spots, we salute you!
---
Such a great comment .... can you just not post a comment when you cannot provide anything helpful?
---
Thats true tho. Have you ever compared fo76 LOD with FO4's?
---
That's what i find funny the people are super salty over on Twitter that Bethesda didn't get booed off stage the haters are loud but they are the minority so Welcome the new players and lets enjoy a friendly wasteland.
---
I will murder who I see fit, when I see fit
---
There was a thread, long time ago, mentioning those plans got upper level limit. At least that was tru for Raider quests. Past it it become .. superraredrop.  Even if I dont have this information confirmed, all data I managed to collect are saying this is "with high chance" true. 
---
 I definitelly stopped UF grin with main, unless I need to sell some junk or low on steel. However I will give it one more go with fresh lowbie. So far it should have best "time spent/chance to get" ratio. 
---
And small note for Bethesda. While I was playing first time, by the time get to Top of the world, by the time I realized there is something like shielded underarmour, by the time I start to search for raiders plans .. I was past level 40 and according those ancient notes past level tresshold to have chance to get a drop. 
---
Oh f\*ck you Bethesda. I hate alts.
---
Your download will take a while but the game should have no issues.
---
Thanks for the reply. My upload speed is 0.67 if thats important.
---
Nuclear winter is 52 players
---
&gt; Everyone becomes overseer? 
---
That sounds suspiciously like communism. You are not a communist, are you... *comrade*?
---
Tomorrow.
---
But is it worth getting back into though? Someone please make the decision for me!
---
I don't know if that's possible but I'd imagine that like Fallout 4 has had a new texture pack (not comparing the two things, but the idea behind it), once the next generation of games comes out to keep 76 "up to date" they might upgrade all of its assets and create within the game a graphic jump like the one between Fallout 3 and 4.
---
Especially since we already know they are using and upgrading this same engine for Starfield, ESVI and eventually, Fo5. I don't think it's going to be any more difficult than splicing the engine's DNA to add multiplayer.
---
There are always chems like the new formula p which grants +5 charisma.
---
Some TSEs on top of that would be perfect
---
NPCs making there arrival a cool looking battle royale what more do you need!
---
Ok. If I run into you or anyone else attacking the new comers I'll just put you down like a rabid dog. Chances of us having a run in are pretty low though
---
June 10th today bud
---
Maybe figuring 1500 atoms is a good portion of average PA skin costs? I dunno
---
VATS is what turns the game from another shooter into a Fallout game.
---
VATS is also the main reason I can play well at the game. I have terrible hand-eye coordination. And keyboard and mouse? No fucking chance with those as a result. I stand a chance in PVP because I have VATS to help me.
---
Removing VATS is just removing part of the accessibility for me. And I really don't like that.
---
How to explain it... Every movement I make, either on keyboard and mouse or controller, is usually too much, or not enough. I struggle to judge how much to move by in order to point where I want. VATS put me on a level playing field with others. I could actually hit targets.
---
Removing it... I really don't like it.
---
I dont have low lvl TSE except a lvl 25 pump and I cant part with it.
---
Very true, forgot about that
---
It's because when settlers came here it was brand new. It led to legends and stories since no one knew what was out here
---
Like Vault 51, Vault 79 does not seem to have any official location or designation before Fallout 76, so the possibilities are endless!
---
Does anyone know if we get a Steam key for the game when it becomes available if we buy fo76 on the Bethesda launcher?
---
agree
---
The free play starts today but updates usually happen on Tuesdays. They may donit a day early though this time.
---
Yup, my guess is you only can bring what on your player into the vault, and you have to use ONLY that to survive.
---
The vault will be a smaller map, and not on the same servers.
---
Easy as pie.
---
As a Battlefront II player, I sympathize
---
Thanks. Is there a way to check system requirements? I have an i5 4460 3.20Ghz CPU with a GTX 960 card. Sorry to bother you but 60 gb download is a commitment, heh.
---
Give it a go. I was running a VPN last night watching some football while I was playing, with the rest of the family streaming the usual stuff (Netflix, YouTube, etc) and my game play was flawless, so I‚Äôm not sure it needs a lot of bandwidth when you‚Äôre actually playing..
---
Can you leave the download running overnight?
---
Don‚Äôt do that.
---
Don‚Äôt give me hope.
---
Ahh i see what your saying actually. I just wanna jump into nuclear winter and see how it plays.
---
In oyur experience, the 5 days trial will be enough?
---
100% agree, with your typical bethesda problems and the fact that its online and bethesda having even less experience in this area I highly doubt this will play well...
---
It's a moo point
---
"We love how nice and friendly our playerbase is. So we are very excited to announce our new murderbowl mode along with a free trial." Thanks Todd, really feeling the love there with that totally not-contradictory presentation.
---
There‚Äôs a function for sending PMs???
---
lol, did see the thing where they said "we made an online game where you could do anything, and you're all so nice to one another, no griefing, you leave helpful items for new players, etc" and thought it was cool.
---
thinking of playing the free version myself, tomorrow (or today. whatever). figured it might've been worked on to the point it's worth my time by now, and figured, why the hell not give it a shot?
---
But they said that nuclear winter sneak peek also started on the 10th and I imagine it‚Äôd require an update to add it, so hopefully that combat update is in there as well
---
The announcement info says that the only thing transferable from Adventure is player appearance and player CAMP blueprints, there are no stashes and player inventory will likely be smaller as strength no longer boosts it passively
---
Yes it is
---
Ah OK. Cool.
---
I just went to the Bethesda website and clicked on the Instagram post announcing the free week but it came up with an error. Where do I go to download the game? Do I have to install the Bethesda Launcher first? Thanks
---
Don‚Äôt bags disappear pretty quick if nobody is nearby?
---
all i know is that u americans feels like owners from buying a product, that's why u deserve your brutal capitalism.
---
don't get fat, stay healthy don't wanna lose your house because of illness
---
i find it's usually fuck people, except sometimes. but then, i'm a but of a pessimist and misanthropist.
---
&gt; glitchy and crash happy
---
Fallout New Vegas is 10x more buggy and crash-happy than Fo76. Even now with all the FNV patches. And yet people still love the game. Wait, isn't it that maybe, just a theory, maybe people can love games despite their issues?
---
If you play everyday, you'll get a fare idea about the game. Although to be fair, you'll not get to see  a lot of high level endgame content.
---
If they dont like Tea, then dont Make them Tea!
---
I would say so. Most of the big bugs are fixed now. A lot of new events and a few new quests.
---
670kbps? It‚Äôs not really that important when it comes to Fallout76 as there is no latency cap, you won‚Äôt be removed from the game for lagging a tiny bit here and there, needless to say it‚Äôs up to you whether you download the game, but you will not have any restrictions when it comes to internet.
---
You could always download, try it out and delete it afterwards as you have nothing to lose, cheers.
---
Username checks out.
---
Ice creamed.
---
Thanks, that clariy things. Yes. I can download constantly so thats not an issue. Is more like will it be playable and if the reduced trial time will be satisfactory.
---
Csgo, rainbow six, cod mw2 and bo1, battlefield 1, battlefield 1942. Just of the top of my head. You not liking a game doesn't mean it's bad
---
You can call me petty if you want but the way they handled Save the World (and the, imo, predatory loot box system within it) is the reason I've sworn off on ever playing an Epic product again, including the Epic store.
---
This means I have to wait long past release for Borderlands 3, but I'll be damned if I cave in to consumer-unfriendly conduct.
---
Sure,
---
tomorrow (from the announcement, so for me, sometime today)
---
I‚Äôm pretty intrigued about our decisions affecting gameplay... not sure how that‚Äôs going to play out in teams. 
---
As big as the world is there‚Äôs room for NPC‚Äôs and more story so I‚Äôm psyched.
---
Ive gotten lost in the main quest. I think I have to complete some side missions but idk...so I hope it isnt locked behind story progression.
---
Thanks for being so helpful. I guess I will give it a go. I'll just need to be patient. :)
---
Yeah. Not happening.
---
I really wish it was a flat rate of caps to respec instead of what they are going with.  It kinda sucks.
---
I think you have earned enough credibility to the community with all the work you do with those bug reports, just the time it takes to make those post and the time it takes to verify each bug is more than enough to show your dedication to the game's improvement.
---
I did get the "this ones a fluffy fan" impression upon reading, but when i saw who posted it i went back into reading.
---
Daaaamn üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
I absolutely understand your point.
---
However VATS does give unfair advantage in PvP and having voluntary gamemode without and to rely only on reflexes and skill it is a sound decision. I couldn't be happier actually.
---
I think it's better to let them work things out for themselves. If you give everything to them, they will grow lazy and confident.
---
Did you even pay attention when they repeatedly stated that the nuke silos are automated and shit whos to say there aren't more than matriarch scorchbeast
---
Can Enclave characters have a third main quest branch where they just sit in the Whitesprings bunker glaring into monitors showing Eyebot-cams of all the filthy muties who want to move into our garden after a year of weeding?
---
The game is encouraging role diversity, which it really needs to do at this point, too many people have gone full dps/lone wolf when the game is intended for groups. In the trailer the speech test showed there were multiple speech options, not just charisma, just like the previous games so there's no real point try to fit a build around such little information. If they gave an easy respec option people would just use it to change when convenient rather than put any thought in to character building unless they made it monumentally expensive to do. You can always level a new toon to try a different build. It doesn't take that long.
---
It's a good way to Incentivise playing it. I am a little worried that it's going to split the player base up alot though.
---
Wip out some cash then
---
It IS a core aspect of the fallout franchise but it just doesn't belong in this game mode. It still belongs in the normal game and in PvP in the normal game otherwise Vats build PvE players wouldn't be able to defend their workshops.
---
I‚Äôm broke
---
Agreed. It is pretty funny seeing all the hate outside of this sub. What was shown yesterday will only bring in more new players.
---
Plenty do and I'm excited for it.
---
Once they pay for the game they will keep playing and that's what matters
---
"Bethesda hears us"
---
Are you fucking kidding me? They made **A BATTLEROYALE MODE FOR AN OLDSCHOOL RPG CROWD!**
---
We're a bunch of adult nerds, who crave Fallout lore and questing, not BR's! The BR mode is the most tone deaf "bandage" possible. Imagine how many more bugs would have been squashed or how many more NPC's could've been added, if this BR idea was never lifted off the ground?
---
What a waste of resources and time.
---
Steal a copy from a store.
---
Whats the best gear you can have at level 1?
---
Yes. I have to work so I will only have a few hours everyday to actually play. Thanks for your insight.
---
&gt; Fallout community is really afraid of competitive challenges against other humans.
---
That's the whole reason people play Fallout. They are here for the post-apocalyptic environment, funny/dark NPCs and shooting on raiders. It's much more relaxing than competing against other real humans.
---
You guys are very helpful
---
Problem is, Bethesda denying it would look bad on them as this is a massive deal that usually when done with other games has resulted in the games being significantly improved and made into great games. If this isn't true they benefit from not squashing it.
---
I say this as someone who believes you because this is something that other games have had done.
---
plus, it's not like that's the sort of thing everyone's interested in in the first place. you can still be disinterested, just because you haven't tried it, or that it's new.
---
Honestly, I will, and I'm sure I'm not alone. The more you play fast and loose with your own settings lore and internal consistany, the less cohesive it becomes.
---
Some may be locked behind story (ie complete x quest before we give you this one)
---
or level based (ie this mission you'll face twp level 60 assaultrons) so lower levels won't stand a chance
---
Have to wait and see
---
Remove your mods
---
I was only in favor of removing it in PvP.
---
Dont look at them..
---
Usually a Matriarch is the leader. Why would there be multiple leaders? No government irl has multiple leaders. There is only one, whether it be the President, Putin, etc. etc. so there is only one. The same thing in Ant colonies, there is only one queem usually. Colonies only have one because the queen doesn't like to have her power tested. I'd imagine Scorchbeasts are the same, having one leader for the entire colony.
---
It'll either be in about 4 hours time or tomorrow when they do the weekly refresh thing.
---
Like many have said, I'm sure it will be just like Wild Appalachia, where we had Survival but also many PvE stuff.
---
Doubtful
---
It should NOT be removed form PvP in the normal game modes we already have. As I said then anyone with a vats build for PvE wouldn't be able to defend their workshops at all.
---
I'm hoping for the best too. Beth lost a great deal of goodwill since the launch, but I do hope this means they buckle up and pay attention to their quality control. I always maintain that a shoddy product is a symptom of lax management, so I do hope the managers, product owners and such be more vigilant in the future.
---
So the game will now be what it should have been from the start
---
I think the sarcasm was missed
---
Make the wasteland pure again
---
I'm talking about Survival and the new BR mode, not Adventure.
---
Survival mode pulled some hostile players away, others got bored since it's not a good griefing platform.
---
*You will find assholes anywhere you look, even in nice places if you try*, so there's no guarantee.
---
With all the painful twisting and turning to try and make the lore work, it baffles me why Beth didn‚Äôt make FO76 non canon.
---
See you next post troll!
---
I don't see how?
---
With VATS, everyone is on a level playing field. Everyone has access to VATS.
---
Without VATS, there isn't a level playing field for people like me.
---
i guess it should be available over the xbox store if you cant find it it may just take a bit of time üëçüèº
---
Help them today to rob them blind tomorrow.
---
Seems like a sound strategy to me.
---
I mean is not like you can be a raider if there is no one left to raid.
---
"People are still loving a game I don't like. Look, they made a comment about the haters. Let's swap the word hate for criticism and let's see if they discover my strawman."

Yes ok it is primarily a Multiplayer game, but Bethesda have said that the whole game can be played solo. Which means that access to locations should be available to solo players and not limited to multiplayer folks only
---
I'm not arguing against BR or PvP modes, as that at least seperates those who only want to do PvP into those areas, leaving soloists free to explore with limited PvP if they so choose do so as part of quests, etc.   
---
What I'm unhappy about is that Solo players are unable to enter an area as highly anticipated as Vaults without having to go into the full on MP modes. This is restrictive and breaks their claims that solo players can get the complete experience.
---
I watched a youtuber pout over todd getting a standing ovation and he said not many people stood for that ovation and just call all of Bethesda's show case boring
---
All the functional camp parts can be found and crafted in game.
---
They fit well and look pretty good.
---
If you want to change what skin a given item uses, you probably have to grind up or fork over some atoms.
---
haha, yeah I know the struggle! my average is around a 1.5mbps, but I tend to only get 700kbps sometimes, it‚Äôs times like those that Fallout76 is really one of the only games I can play without restrictions as games with limits would just kick me out for having high latency :(
---
All these people who never played it for any meaningful amount of time were calling bullshit on that in the Twitch-streams.. They're just propagating their uninformed lies at this point (on my internet? I know).. Blinded by their own rage.
---
And do you mind me telling why the human NPC, questline and everything else went to waste by saying Battle Royale?
---
Im torn on this. I like the idea of more NPCs, but i wish they would've stuck to their guns on no "human" npcs. We're could've seen non-feral ghouls, more friendly super mutants,  scorched that haven't gone mad yet, mole miners, maybe another mutated race/species. 
---
I know im probably the only one that feels this way, but from the jump they could've done quite a bit more and still not had "human" npcs.
---
Does anyone know what is going to be lost if anything upon death in this new game mode ?
---
Survival VATS should stay in my opinion. Of you dont want to get killed form the shadows by a vats crit build then go play adventure. Because there are no legendaries and wont be kind of builds in BR I agree that vats shouldn't be used.
---
Might want to teach people you give them to how to make salve, too.
---
Exactly. Help them start out... let them build up.... take all their stuff.
---
Raiders. Get. To. Continue. Shooting. You. (;
---
I'm even more excited for this than I was for the original Fallout 76 announcement. It looks like an entirely new game set in that land I've come to love.
---
There is enough content already for you, if you are casual like me you will be happy with the game
---
Gotcha.  That‚Äôs a good acknowledgement of what happened.  Good for him.
---
I've suggested many times a whole rebalance for Survival, with no VATS and no invisibility among many other things... but I know it won't happen.
---
I haven‚Äôt listened to any of them yet, but assuming it‚Äôs the tale of the windigo, that‚Äôs one of my favorite folk horror stories. 
---
On a side note, windogos should totally be able to be eaten by the cannibal perk. They‚Äôre literally humans that were warped by a cannibalistic spirit. What‚Äôs more poetic than them winding up on my stomach after I punch their heads off?
---
No joke, if they brought out a BFG skin for the Fatman I'd make a new Doom Guy character instantly
---
Im with you on that, they should just focus on survival im not intrested in battle royal at all
---
Get into Survival Mode....sure you can.
---
And that's fair enough but should they really be spending all that effort on something no one asked for instead of, idk, fixing a few bugs instead of adding more?
---
Saying that... I'm still obviously gonna give it a try but my expectations aren't high. Battle royale players aren't gonna start playing fo76 simply because there's better BR games out there and fo76 played didn't pay to play BR.
---
There is no reason. Its survival mode not PvP mode so taking away a specific build type is just silly.
---
Verified how exactly? Just who he is?
---
Personally they got me so excited for that but then when they said Battle Royal it just brought my hype back down because i remembered that idc anymore
---
Ive literally just changed my build and removed a lot from Charisma. I suppose it will give me something to do till its released!
---
Anthem had everything planned and then scraped the plan
---
I sell everything at 100 per legendary star. Idk how these people make any caps sitting on all that inventory.
---
it looks cool and all but if it‚Äôs just another deathmatch game mode then i agree, not really excited.
---
as for the npcs, i‚Äôve gotten so used to the robots and silence that i kinda like it that way now, if i want npcs i go play fallout 4.
---
You do know that BR is a totally different gamemode that won't happen in regular servers and the game won't be affected by it, right?
---
&gt;TLDR: updates of the game ARE the story of the game. And those who will begin to play in one year will not see the world as it was but only how it became.
---
I really hope those who buy he game later will still be given the chance to play though the first chapter of the game. I'd hate not being able to play through the story because I can't afford a pc to play the game on.
---
I like this idea. Maybe I'll even sell some stimpacks at 2 caps a pop at camp.
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA You people are either new or posers.
---
If this was what you wanted you singlehandedly ruined a franchise.
---
Plenty asked for battle Royale, you don't= the majority.
---
Reddit isn't the majority of this game, most of the people who I've played with aren't from reddit and are excited for the br
---
Err... Survival IS PvP mode.
---
Playing since BETA, I have played little of the game as it doesn‚Äôt tap that itch like the other Fallouts do. It doesn‚Äôt mean I dislike it, the concept is great, but as a traditional gamer, I don‚Äôt really do online, much, so it‚Äôs my own fault in the first instance. I am just a sucker for Fallout, I‚Äôm tattooed and merch‚Äôd up, too!
---
Ignore the morons, if you don‚Äôt like it, don‚Äôt play! I will eventually play, again. The train wreck in the beginning is
---
likely to make people weary, it‚Äôs good they‚Äôre asking, a used copy is a good investment, now. 
---
Good on you all for defending what you like. Stupid thing is, I would still shell out the used ¬£100 price-tag to get that blasted helmet... üòÅ It‚Äôd look great with my Pip-Boy! üòù
---
Stay strong Fallouteers! ü•∞
---
Great idea!
---
You can't tell me what to do!!
---
I plan on feeding all of them! 
---
So I'll end up being like some crazy cat lady, but instead of being a lady and collecting cats, I'm a guy collecting newbies. I will make them into my army and rule the world!
---
I also would like to thin out some raider numbers
---
Do you think Wastelanders will be a separate game mode? Rose is sort of pivotal to the main quest line (unfortunately), so I don't think we'll be able to kill her
---
I really think that Bethesda should have started with a co-op fallout game first. Start with borderlands style gameplay so if the multiplayer is completely unserviceable it wouldn't have turned out as badly as FO76's launch did. 
---
Though doing it that way would have meant possibly bogging down the release of their next fallout title. Maybe this was all a test for Starfield to have MP?
---
Everyone has a companion named Hary, of course.
---
Yeah, i dont let that shit effect my enjoyment of the game. Hell, Todd owned up to the critisim. But, people will be people and blindly hate on it just because of the name. Even adding human NPCs won't sway them.
---
Weird, a guy with a fallout related username, barely any karma. Talks about the mean people hating on the game?
---
Nice.
---
Actually without the leaderboard and the giveaway on map, the mode will be more enjoyable. I have a character there that deals with the mode quite well. I prioritized the perks for survival and junk/aid on her is set to minimal. Also the camp is hidden and spartan like. And my K/D is 2/1 due to being wanted one time.
---
I totally agree with you man, I had the same thing. I got hyped for npc‚Äôs and then crushed back into the hole by the battle royale
---
Just don't go [Dixie](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Dixie) on them afterwards.
---
Those holotapes, they were Haunting.
---
Thanks for the info. This is probably a silly question, but for the crippling effect, is it just a flat % chance, regardless of where the enemy is hit, or do you need to either use VATS to target limbs or manually aim at limbs?
---
You should be ashamed. 
---
How would these poor people feel better about themselves if they can‚Äôt look down on a video game? 
---
So what you‚Äôre saying is you want these people to recognise that they aren‚Äôt as special as they think they are? You monster!
---
In all seriousness I think that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs about. Fallout 76 (and No Mans Sky originally) are the fall guys. No matter how badly a person fucks up, we‚Äôve got these things to look down on right? 
---
Just imagine ‚Äòbeing‚Äô one of those people though. Someone so bitter and small-minded that you find joy in someone else‚Äôs failure. And to be totally fair......the studio behind Fallout 76 created a world for people to enjoy. The people you‚Äôre referring to have most likely done nothing except talk on camera.
---
I think you mean Fallout 2!
---
Because people didn‚Äôt hold your hand through looking up information? There‚Äôs so much new stuff that we don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre already familiar with and what‚Äôs new to you. So yeah, just look it up, don‚Äôt base your decision on playing the game on a reddit exchange
---
Yeah i know.  Its just the point of it, i knew it was coming but i liked to not believe it.
---
&gt;But people literally just shitting on everything they had to announce was kinda cringe. People just hating to hate. Not giving a chance. Idk it was different when I was watching the other companies, people were more willing
---
For some people Bethesda and EA are epitomes of evil game developers, so such reaction should be expected.
---
I just came back a month ago and i have been playing it ALOT. It‚Äôs so much better than lunch. You just have to have a goal to work towards wether it is a cool camp, specific builds or just exploring.
---
They've accidentally brought a model over from Doom.
---
every level. oh!, and you get card packs every 5 levels
---
Yeah, I was just having bad luck on this all around. Even after dropping the caps for the plan, then finding out I had this bug, I also realized I needed a bunch of flux.
---
How exactly do you kill people, seeing as you can't damage people without them attacking you.
---
now i can just imagine four level twos crawling on the ground behind you like stray dogs waiting for you to drop another can of cram as you just try to mind your own business
---
VATS is an integral game mechanic... People with luck builds will be useless in battle royale mode!
---
You think they're listening by adding a Battle Royale? LOL
---
Me too! It was so much fun to see all those level 2 hesitating around, being clueless about food and healing plants, eating molerats around a campfire...
---
If I had to start the game now I'd feel weird, being surrounded by level 200 guys who drop fifty blueprints at your feet while clearing the area for you.
---
You can earn stuff for camps and cosmetics in br mode that can be transferred to adventure mode.
---
 In way that kind of affects it and is forcing me to play a mode I have no interest in.
---
Yeah I miss the days where my FE Pump could 2-3 shot Scorch Beasts, I had to put shotguns down completely. They basically aren't even viable anymore....
---
Usually Bethesda updates the game at around 11:00 to 1:00 EST. So there‚Äôs a chance that the free week may start around then. If you find that you really enjoy the game, it‚Äôs on a pretty heavy discount this week. Hope you enjoy!
---
Lol. No. It has unrestricted PvP in it but if you'll notice your survival score is tied to multiple things including time alive, xp earned, and yes players killed. If your "survival score" isnt based on just PvP then thatd not what it is. Bethesda never once called it PvP mode nor did they imply that's what it was intended to be.
---
I already chose a side.
---
I think PS4 will have the biggest player base.
---
An option to kill her and have a Settler with mad hacking skills pick apart her memory banks to move the story forward could work though?
---
Even at launch Anthem was in a better state then FO76 was when it came out. The main problem was and is not enough loot and content and not 1000 bugs.
---
Hell FO76 had so many bugs at launch you couldn t play it properly.
---
Yeah I noticed, I think I‚Äôm going to like it. Thanks for the help
---
 It'll also have less assets to load though. Instead of the entire 76 map and indoor spaces, it'll just have to render the battle map. I could be wrong since I haven't seen the map but I'm hoping I'm not.
---
Workshops, survival mode, and them not understanding that they shouldn't hit back.
---
Locks you out of extra unlockables to not play it it seems!

---
But would that new character would need to grind even more to get the right legendary items to round out the build. Forgive me if I'm over exaggerating this whole issue (I'm man enough to admit that), but it just feel like more grinding than necessary.
---
Jesus. You guys managed to almost completely remove PvP from Adventure, and now you want Survival too? Just get.
---
I can't believe you are this delusional. Survival was made with one specific purpose: to gather PvPers into a **PvP mode**, so those of you in Adventure could keep picking flowers without being bothered.
---
Go read the ITV and the patchnotes back when Survival was announced.
---
Dang I have problems with some bugsbut what I want in the game is maybe some races like u can be a supermunat or a goul and obviously a human and each one has advantages but also disadvantages
---
Supermunats have immunity to rads and diseases but can't use power armor
---
Gouls r immune to rads and diseases and has super strength and high endurance but cannot use weapons
---
Humans stay the same not immune to rads and disease and can use power armor and weapons
---
Also maybe add in factions that r player made and recognized in that way with faction names that u joined above ur head with ur job
---
Make custom flags
---
Add wooden stairs that can go inside your Canp cuz I'm tired of the metal ones
---
Add more budget space
---
Fix the bug of fast traveling to a camp and being stuck under there base
---
Fix the invisible tick glitch
---
Fix the scorchbeast's loot or make them weaker if their loot is gonna be a bad as it is
---
And I'm as excited about the human npcs but how is that going to work with everyone that hasn't beet the main story yet like we haven't found the cure for the scorched disease but people come back
---
Are scorched enimes that used to be human staying or did the new people wipe them all out
---
The human npcs are amazing but are they going to help the game or just mess with the story line
---
Hey thats great! Thumbs up emoticon.... The point is if you worry about k/d then your update is soon.. And dont sweat what ppl say....you'll grow a penis someday! Huzzah!
---
Same is true for the opposite, plenty != Majority. We'll just have to see how that goes, it's pointless discussing how good it is without playing it first.
---
....and maybe get BGS to buff the white knight perk
---
&gt; Hell, the engine barely functions properly on it's base mode with 24 players or so, let alone 52 plus all the mechanics that goes into a BR mode.
---
I'm pretty confident about that actually, because it won't be the whole map and half of the 52 players will die in the first minute doing something silly.
---
That's awesome, getting a bit of face time with the mothership.
---
Personally, I've never believed B isn't watching forums and reading bug reports. I owned two small businesses for 25 years and I'll tell you, this kind of data is worth its weight in gold. I see all kinds of people (like yourself), who, rather than just screaming and ranting, post up well-articulated notes of feedback on various issues.
---
Bethesda's (and any game company) fear isn't that people make to much noise on forums; they fear the community going silent. Because then they don't care anymore.
---
Awesome opossum bacon!! Thanks for thisüôÇ
---
Just download the game on the store, it should show as free for now. Once the free week is over you won‚Äôt be able to open the game again unless you buy it
---
And now the photo mode is useful to preserve thr past
---
How can you help people who are stuck inside camp objects after fast traveling to other players camp?
---
Hang on there kiddo. I never said I wanted survival. I said people shouldn't be crybaby ass loud mouths about getting killed in survival by Vats. Vats builds exist in adventure and characters transfer over so it had to stay.
---
Because the are using a reduced map.
---
I support this, FULLY
---
I'm the only one that saw the space station changed in the trailer?
---
If I can do nuclear winter without loosing my junk and everyone has non legendary items, then yes please.
---
I think this guy beat you to it.
---
https://youtu.be/IyDDQRhJu1I
---
Lmao.
---
Running out of easy prey these new players are nothing but cattle to you. Feed and care for them until they get old enough to slaughter.
---
What is the relevance of those old buildings in Oamaru here?
---
This is an example
---
Yeah that‚Äôs all the game is just a battle royale you‚Äôre totally right
---
Well, lets be honnest, I don't forget that any online RPG i ever played always got (a lot of) issues at launch.
---
What matters is how they are now. How they did at start doesn't matter much, in fact.
---
Its good but not quite the same as my vision.
---
Maybe you should stop being so melodramatic. It's a game mode, play it if you want or not. 
---
You will not get waterboarded for refusal to play.
---
Honestly at this point im fine with 76 being in the "soft canon" range like fallout tactics. As long as it means players get to use some cool and iconic bits of fallout gear even if it doesnt really make sense in the lore
---
The explosive build isn't worthwhile anymore. But the TSE weapons still are.
---
It's still a great game regardless of their new battle royale mode that and no one is forcing you to play it you can have just as much fun with this game without even touching the br mode
---
I dont ask for much.. your thanks and servitude is enough.
---
Just don't get upset when some of the new players don't want handouts. Respect the fact that some players want to do everything on their own and don't want to start off with an advantage.
---
 I made a new character not that long ago and had a guy follow me around for a good 10-15 minutes trying to get me to pick up a bag of stuff that he dropped that I did not want. I had no way to communicate to him that I did not want it because I do not use a mic.
---
You arent wrong. This is a perfect description of my I mentions. Well, except that I dont want easy prey, I want them to fight. The more they fight me the more devastated they are in total defeat.
---
Let's give the tenth chance to the Bethesda! Maybe tenth time they will succeed for the first time. I am still very suspicious about that, but who knows.
---
wtf
---
Well, we will know what to think in few hours, I believe.
---
For now, I just wait to see.
---
Whitespring. The original and still the best. It‚Äôs all based on the server, though. 
---
After a run I might walk away with only 2-3 legendary drops. On the next server I might come off with 10. 
---
Last week I found a server where almost every other ghoul dropped one and came away with over 20.
---
It looks unique with the nukes and npc randomly spawning in. The best thing is that you dont have to play this gamemode, theres always be adventure. So all i can say to you is goodbye.
---
I noticed return of this bug soon after 17th may update. They got back unyielding twice boost bug as well.
---
This is amazing... Honestly, this is more than I would have expected from Bethesda. I know they listen to feedback, but this really shows us that they care. What is sad tho, is that this won't get reported outside of Fo76 circles. This is positive news and people out there don't spread positive news about the game. No, they'll focus on how "Bethesda is desperate with BR" and willingly omit this amazing piece of news... Hell, r/Fallout is trying to forget that Wastelanders got announced and focuses only on Nuclear Winter...
---
And here come the wave of fanboy fanatics who can‚Äôt read...
---
ah yes
---
the addition of a gamemode you will never be required to play, that tons and tons of mainstream gamers do quite enjoy the concept of - that is the straw that should break the camel's back.
---
Also consider for a second maybe not everybody does everything for greed. *MAYBE* they just thought it would be cool to do and so they did it.
---
THIS SHOULDA BEEN MARKED NSFW
---
No. I have all kinds of shit from the pioneer scouts and haven't started those quests.
---
2 words: player vending.
---
Buy the plans you want.
---
I didn‚Äôt realize my comments stirred so many emotions from you...
---
You must be very sensitive.  I‚Äôm so sorry..
---
If they don't include the stuff from each of those 52 folks, then server load will be extremely reduced.
---
Same with the C.A.M.P.S.
---
Not fanboying but you saying that pretty much confirms where this post comes from. Ignorance.
---
Nuclear Winter is a free filler until we get wastelanders
---
I never said anyone was forcing me.. that was never even remotely suggested.
---
There is a free week, starting in few hours I believe: You will be able to decide for yourself :)
---
If you can polymer the scout armor it‚Äôs on par with BOS combat.  If you are going for pure ballistic reduction heavy metal is kind.  Energy damage reduction heavy leather.
---
No doubt, this location and NAR trainyard are both on my grind circuit.
---
Omfg man,I'm telling you that looks B-nana Nanas lol. I get laid of for a few months a couple weeks before nov. so I'm,gearing up heavily for the upcoming situation,I'm gonna gather a crew of 6-10 high level players,and make a small group to lace up these events properly,PUMPED AF.
---
I guess my point about their focusing on adding his game mode before finishing their primary game mode enhancements was lost in translation?  Or are you another one who can‚Äôt read?
---
Welp, maybe I‚Äôm about to regret trading 76 in but I‚Äôll reserve my judgement until this update actually comes out. The difference having npcs will make in my eyes is huge though.
---
Well she's still talking to us in holotapes.  I'm just glad she survived that hotel!  I was convinced she died!
---
"NO" emote, I'm pretty sure it's unlocked for everyone from start :P
---
All I'm saying is give it a shot you don't need the battle royale mode to ruin it for you I'm honestly disappointed Bethesda even added that but I'm still gonna play and have just as much fun in adventure mode
---
r/thathappened
---
YouTube is full of shit.
---
I don't care so much about battle Royal, but the wastelanders expansion looks like it's going to give everyone what they wanted.    They are dumping a ton of money and effort into the game.  I am excited about the future.
---
  You say how disappointed you were with the game but you never gave it a try?
---
Without Vats it‚Äôs just reliant on skill for a death match type game mode so I don‚Äôt see what is wrong with this. Yes if everyone has Vats it may give a level playing field for the non pvp‚Äôers and the pvp‚Äôers but in a battle royale there needs to be an aspect of skill to get kills not what is technically auto aim. Just my few cents on the situation :)
---
Yeah, thank Bethesda for releasing a broken product, getting deserved hate and the sucking their dick for not fucking up even worse
---
This reply is just sad.  Yes, businesses absorb what is the most profitable business scheme in gaming itself... because they think it would be ‚Äúcool.‚Äù  And here I thought the term ‚Äúshrill‚Äù was overly used...
---
You will notice a clickable fart :)))
---
You knew this day would come yet you fought the good fight.
---
by sheer fact of this being officially verified as a thing to have happened, and understanding and having read the entirety and -honest- detailing of what went down on that face to face meet up, if someone who has stared into the face of this many bugs consistently and repetitively and come out with what sounds like an overwhelmingly hopeful tone for the future of this game, then i too can put some hope into its future as well. i wont stop being irritated by the bugs, i will continue to talk within my own friend circle about what could be done better and where i think its lacking, but i will also not lose hope in FO76's future, and i couldnt say that definitively before reading this post. thank you.
---
You assume the most ridiculous excuse for why a business absorbed the most profitable business model in the industry.  Yep - totally ignorant on my part.
---
This was a fantastic read and great to hear that the devs would invest time in speaking directly to their community. 
---
Thank you for the post!
---
Fallout 76 is a very buggy game, even unplayable at times. Also, they will twist your arm to buy from the atom shop. Bethesda is very unhelpful with problems, and there normal response is ‚Äú lol, idk, figure it out yourself‚Äù. ESO is better and more fun. But you could try your hand at fallout 76, but be warned there is no return once you have the game.
---
As long as the devs remain committed to fixing the bugs in the other game modes I don't mind that they cater to proclivities other than my own.
---
I cannot really berate them for trying new things or attempting to bring in/retain more people.
---
New radio song!!!
---
And then you find Bound Bow, and you can be a stealth archer mage
---
so you're saying they should completely finish every piece of content they plan to release for all of time for this intentionally evolving game's bulk of content, the meat of the product, which will continuously evolve and is intentionally built to reward continued player engagement over time by dropping new batches of content over the course of months and months - they should finish ALL that, rendering the game 'complete' by your arbitrary standard, despite the fact that the current evolving dev model not actually supporting an an inherent definition of 'completion' - before they do a battle royale mode?
---
pal, i really don't think you should be criticizing other people's base levels of intelligence. you either don't understand the basics of the development roadmap they've set out for us, or are just looking for an excuse to feel intellectually superior for not liking something.
---
Both
---
Are you on PC?
---
Never tried it but thanks to the YouTube generation.. we can see live gameplay pretty much anytime we want as the best way to learn if it‚Äôs a game we would play.  I‚Äôve looked at the expansions and was optimistic until I realized that Bethesda was jumping into the BR cash cow world.  That‚Äôs such a turn off
---
Even though you can argue Fallout 76's launch was nastier than the usual RPG launches i mostly agree with you,
---
\&gt; What matters is how they are now.
---
the point of my post is to remind people to wait until the update is released before praising Bethesda, "because right now" as you said, is pretty far from great.
---
When will it start?
---
So I guess the "we won't make a BR" went the way of "only cosmetics in the store" huh? Fuck bethesda right in their asses. They should be fixing bugs amd adding actual content not making a shitty game mode they said they wouldn't touch. What's next? Loot boxes and keys?
---
Seeing as the lack of NPC‚Äôs was always a huge problem in this game for people, I don‚Äôt see how their addition could hurt it.
---
Purely cosmetic stuff that you can buy from other places.
---
It doesn‚Äôt show as free yet I just checked again :\ and I tried restarting my Xbox to see if it would update and it didn‚Äôt
---
Idk I‚Äôm assuming later today ?
---
Thanks,  I just saw this and will give it a go.
---
Thanks, what do you mean no return lol?
---
Probably later today.
---
But they were only used in California
---
If you go for an outfit that is not clown related I am in these shenanigans.
---
Without giving anything away, one of the main quests tries to send you to a town in the Ash Heap, which IMO is too high for that level range.  You could easily spend the first 20 levels in the forest, exploring and taking workshops. The workshops give two rewards in the span of five minutes, and each time a plan is included (for camp building). You'll get stimpaks, fresh water, you name it. Take every one you come across, even if you don't use it for resources. It's an XP goldmine.
---
When connecting wires, you have to make sure the wire turns from red to green, indicating the connection is good. Then just press the same button to complete it. Building has a lot of little quirks that you have to figure out, but once you do, it's pretty seamless.
---
A " couple of questions:" is two. spend the $30 and try it you'll like it, if not it was only $30 people spend more going to McDonalds a "couple" times a week
---
The problem people had from the beginning was that Bethesda released a buggy mess that was very far from a completed product worth $60, its the same thing that Anthem did. 
---
Imagine what the response to the game would have been if the games launch was just a BETA and the actual launch was now with the new expansion.
---
I am looking forward to where this games goes if Bethesda sticks with it.
---
Nah. I would be wearing an angry helmet, plague doctor mask, and pastors vestments. The followers will wear no clothes but would armor.
---
Then go play other stuff and stop whining on reddit lol
---
It won't be content that significantly affexts the game if it goes along the same vein as survival mode, I haven't touched that at all and I still have fun in the game without any of the rewards from the challanges
---
It's on sale now on psn.
---
The term is shill and the content is free.
---
Activate. The. Fucking. Pylons.
---
I think so too, I was just a bit suprised we didn't get to hear more details about it at all, comparing to the attention and detail some of the other games got :/
---
I feel like we may get an updated version of the game world which we will choose from in the menu kind of how we choose different modes now.
---
I like your reddit profile, you dont even play the game.. cmon.
---
Oh ok, didnt know that, thanks!
---
Once you pay for the game, Bethesda doesnt allow refunds
---
They didn't say anything about being able to buy them. I read you earn them as you rank up your overseer rank.
---
 So from what it says the only way you acquire them is to play battle royale.
---
Can‚Äôt wait to see how this engine attempts to handle battle royale
---
It looks like they couldn't fix the stretching bug with some enemies and they just re-skinned them.
---
Again, your statements make a ton of wild assertions that do not apply.  They released a very broken game.  They are still working on fixing it and are already releasing BR, implying it‚Äôs been in development during normal game development.  This also infers that resources that could have been dedicated to initial core game developments were deferred to this mode.
---
It‚Äôs disappointing.. that‚Äôs all I said.  I‚Äôm sorry you and several other frequenter subrettirors here are but hurt about my opinion that contrasts your own.  What I don‚Äôt care for, is your straw man arguments that seeks to make me seem ‚Äúless intelligent‚Äù by whatever fucked up standards you have for critical thought
---
I'm pretty sure your non cosmetic build and gear won't matter for BR. Everyone will likely start the same and only get perks and boosts found while playing the event.
---
Thanks mate. Really appreciate it. I updated the post to to say "a few questions".
---
This still isn't fixed? I stopped after level 103 or so, and I hadn't gotten the achievement/trophy for level 100.
---
[And apparently even Fallout 1](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Turbo_plasma_rifle_\(Fallout\))! I had no idea. Well, that gives it an even more impressive pedigree.
---
You just compared a giant bat with ants
---
Not to mention that when matriarch dies another takes her place as matriarch in a Lich King type deal
---
Your stat spread still matters though!
---
You compared bats to lichs.
---
I agree with you. (Maybe not the condescending tone). But as a player who likes to explore a game solo before getting help, I do enjoy seeing a game for myself without the pressure of looking like a complete fool to the lvl 200+ player dancing around in the best/most interesting gear the game has as soon as the game starts.  
---
I would think setting up the ‚Äúwelcome new players‚Äù camps should go near the Overseers camp. Give the newbies a few minutes of ‚Äúwtf is going on‚Äù and ‚Äúoh wow this looks great‚Äù before we start heart emoji/thumbs up emoji/paper bag shooting to them.
---
Greed scheme???? I thought the ‚ÄúBattle Royale‚Äù was a free update!
---
honestly im just hoping and hoping that theres a semi automotron style bot builder base item so i can get ED-E flying around and watching my back like vegas. i miss that little chrome dome.
---
They literally showed human npcs to calm ignorant outrage yet here we are. Don‚Äôt wanna play nuclear winter? You don‚Äôt have to. Don‚Äôt wanna play 76? You don‚Äôt have to. It‚Äôs ok drama queen.
---
would be cool
---
That‚Äôs a fair opinion.  It was a disappointment for me and looked desperate like Destiny 2..and Anthem.. just not as bad.
---
Those absenting perk cards are a key to your answer - VATS relies on many of them + luck build + vats/crit weapons and so on. Only without those everyone is truly on a level playing field, aka yoor speed, reflex, eye-hand coordination...   
---
Also nobody is forcing anyone to participate in BR.
---
I quit a few levels after reaching 100 and not getting the achievement or trophy. Sad to see it's still not fixed.
---
We know they failed at item integrity in an item-based game. That doesn‚Äôt bode well for stopping performance hacks, which are much tougher to secure against, since many hacks are client-side.
---
Yep, this guy gets it.
---
I'm gonna murder every goddamn NPC I see on every server I see until it's back how it used to be
---
Thanks, was just checking it out and didnt see anything related to these bonuses glad i didnt buy yet
---
Lootboxes... it‚Äôs an industry standard.  Much of it is only aesthetic things like ‚Äúhorse armor‚Äù but it‚Äôs for making money.  That‚Äôs it
---
So my friend's alternate character seems to have a lot of issues with animations and model deformation. Surprisingly it happens pretty much once a night on that account and not on his main account. These issues are also not visible on his end but for everyone else. The [gatling laser incident](https://youtu.be/LMlsHNpOBqk) happened last night; last week he was running around T-posed holding a meteoric sword out firing gatling plasma projectiles from his chest while the impacts were at his feet... While bugs usually irritate me, the antics of his character always give me a good laugh.  
---
I'm not sure if the cap is still in place currently but I received a pop-up message saying there was a limit of 10/day a couple months ago. It seems relatively fair in order to control flooding their inbox every time an update hits.
---
Yeah lol
---
 They are definitely betting on battle royale. The community has dwindled since the game launched and has received nothing but bad press. They need something big that‚Äôs going to get large part of the audience back.
---
Read the Beth's post, please. Everyone start from 0, matches last 20 minutes, no gear or perks are carried over from adventure/survival.
---
Is it supposed to be like the BR games where you start with nothing and run to scattered nodes for pickup weapons?
---
Yeah F76 launch was bad, but hell, I was there for the launch of anarchy Online in early 2000s, I can say that was... wayyy nastier ;)
---
But you are right, we should just wait and see. Not much time left, tho.
---
this is the kind of thing i dig, im so glad for pacifist mode now, seeing as how im only ever on adventure, but in the dark days out of beta, i would accidentally damage a workshop, or shoot another player that spooked me walking around a corner. finding someone toi take that bounty of 5 caps from my head.... it was harder to do than you might think.
---
It‚Äôs a message to the developers.  Maybe here, you all speak as a ‚Äúmajority‚Äù opinion, but I assure you - the majority of people who were interested in another Fallout.. haven‚Äôt bought it for similar reasons as I suggested about their flawed development.  And BR is a sign to me that their priorities are not what they should be to improve the game to where many others would play.
---
We are going to see more server crashes than ever, which means there will be no overseers.
---
Correction: People who have previously relied on VATS and can't ADS, will be useless :))
---
I cull the weak in the herd as only the strong have the right to exist. Survival of the fittest. You get in my way? You don‚Äôt get to stay!
---
I take on everyone and everything. Not just the low levelers. But those twice my own size as well.
---
I am a raider, and I don‚Äôt show sympathy for those that only exist to serve my own needs.
---
Things id give to have Ada back‚Ä¶ (along with the the Workbench to customize her)
---
Ahhh. Yea loot boxes don‚Äôt bother me. If someone wants to spend money on that bs be my guest. Just hope they continue to grow the core game!
---
well...  the lack of NPC‚Äôs was always a huge problem in this game for people \*who don't play the game\*... right?
---
I‚Äôll be lurkin around for sure...gonna whip out the fssnacht masks for the week.
---
r/woosh
---
Yeah same here, mine is stalkers but because I run a 1 handed melee build it actually worked out pretty well
---
You are not a very smart raider then. You have to give the weak supplies, wait for them to use it to build up to untold riches and THEN kill them and take their stuff.
---
I have found a dog helmet too, its been in my stash for months waiting for the day i get my dog in 76.
---
I see what you are saying, but the point of my post was the same disappointment you described.  And others here are acting like I‚Äôve purposefully come to their home and held a gun to their head because they purchased the game.  It‚Äôs quite sad we can‚Äôt even have mature conversations on this reddit about developer priorities without others being so emotional.
---
Lol. Owl masks.
---
Become a cannibal.
---
Oh I agree completely. Never try to force anything on someone, just kindly offer and accept the situation  if they don't want it.
---
You may have to wait a few more hours then. I think they usually update stuff around 9-10pst for Fallout
---
Installing for sure! This is really cool work!
---
you literally said they should finish their 'primary game mode enhancements' buddy. those will never be 'finished' so long as the game is in active post-release support by the very nature of patches, updates, and content drops.
---
you can't backtrack on your argument halfway through because you don't like acknowledging you can not like something without having to inform the entire internet in your fake 9000iq galaxybrain thinkpiece about how battle royale is the sign that bethesda is just trying to rake in everyone's money with a flagrant cash grab by developing to industry trends as if the very existence of every AAA video game ever isn't influenced by these 'cash grabs' and this supposed pandering.
---
they've released a slew of content patches and updates and are continuing to. they are not 'already' releasing BR, they're offering a 'pre-beta sneak peak', which is a press punch-up'd way of saying it's going into alpha testing.
---
there's little evidence to support that this was in development pre-release and your suppositions and assumptions are based off of a desire to prove yourself right lmfao.
---
the game is free for the next week. maybe try playing the """main game mode""" and gathering the experience to make an informed opinion, and then if you don't like it, don't spend your money on it rather than pretending you, the lone intellectual, are seeing through your third eye while anyone who refutes your argument is 'strawmanning' 'but \[sic\] hurt' or 'a fanboy'.
---
if you really want to whine into the void about fo76 feel free to start r/ihatefo76 or some shit.
---
There will always be griefing and bullying by players of that bent, but the truth is, they're always outnumbered. It's why Nazis of the world always end up getting pounded into oblivion.
---
Cool. I was surprised.
---
I don't see a need to have player camps in this game mode, waste of server space. Hopefully the game won't lag like it does when doing the Encryptid event or Scorched Earth. It does on PS4 for me anyway...
---
I don‚Äôt see why people are so upset over a game mode they don‚Äôt have to play
---
I have not picked it up since I was angry about the no-refunds after the buy price tanked.
---
Is this game... well.. better? Are there more things to do than at launch that aren't bugging out?
---
I wanted to like this game so bad but it was really hard to keep my enthusiasm and attention for long when I finally left the game. I guess most of my anger was at Bethesda and how they were handling PR after PR nightmare
---
Heresy!
---
Yes I am
---
When did they announce loot boxes lmao? All they have is a shop for different style items that don‚Äôt affect the actual game.
---
I submitted a ticket about it(bought 1000 atoms about 6 hours ago). Still no reply from Bethesda.
---
i Wonder if we will lose the lone wanderer perk effect if we use them, i hope not. It made sense in a solo game but here since its online solo player needs all he can get to counter the fact that hes alone.
---
I get you probably enjoy the game, but this feels like a pretty intense hyperbole
---
Technically the NCR Rangers aren't directly related to Shady Sands.
---
The Rangers existed ever since the War, and were simply called [Desert Rangers](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Desert_Rangers) before the NCR began its imperialist campaign of conquests eastwards. [Tycho](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Tycho) in Fallout 1, a possible companion of the Vault Dweller, comes from this group, and he said in his life he travelled from Vegas to the Gulf of Mexico in Texas. The Rangers became NCR army elite much later. The big statue at the mojave outpost is in memory of the event.
---
So adding that wouldn't be lore-breaking at all.
---
This was the vocal majority and I‚Äôm certain density was heavily on their minds and we won‚Äôt have people talking to us every five feet
---
Not sure what happened, but I've got to head off. Thanks for the offer anyway.
---
Nuclear Winter will be a big mess. Bethesda has no experience from that kind of gameplay like they already said so we can expect it will be broken as hell in every way.
---
I'm just saying that no other competitive and successful PvP game has a built-in aimbot.
---
You keep using your crutches, little man. *shrug*
---
Inb4 this is going to be as much of a scam as 76.
---
Lmao. I dont use that build dude. Also, little man? Someone is insecure about themselves, dont see any other reason that would be the insult that comes to mind.
---
K thanks!
---
The crazy noobs lady Army is coming.
---
You call being realistic over the dick in the ass Bethesda gave fans with launch fallout 76 cynicism? Weird flex but ok.
---
Its bugged like anything else Bethesda releases. Could be fixed some day or not.
---
Basically all you need as a solo player, thats what i have too.
---
I would grind White Spring or West Tek for Legendary items then cash in the junk items for scrip then head over to the Purveyor and try your luck.
---
Or check the Player Vending machines I found both of my TSE in vending machines.
---
Well to be fair 76 isn‚Äôt an rpg (in regards to his comment 76 and rpg aren‚Äôt words that go together). But that doesn‚Äôt make it a bad game *shrug*.  Just not an rpg and not for those wanting an rpg.
---
Either way dude give the game a shot you'll like it plus the new wastelanders update is bringing nps to 76 this fall so there's something to look forward to
---
Lol the hate on BR is unreal. It fits the game, but because it reminds people of Fortnite we can't have it? lmao
---
Everyone is getting a bit desperate; the 'Games as a Service' cow is a fickle one and her udders can dry out in a whim.
---
Then every farmer has to scramble to find new ways to coax her into giving the sweet sweet milk the landlords crave.
---
But that is a different conversation altogether.
---
clownshoes
---
Now some things can‚Äôt be unseen
---
I dunno, Queen runs already have a 50-50 chance to be a total shitshow when enough people show up without the firepower to hurt the actual queen.
---
Having ten "Billy Sidekick" NPCs in their vaultsuits getting eaten by Scorched Fogcrawlers probably can't hurt much.
---
As we say in Louisiana; Fuck 'em.
---
I can no longer unsee it now fuck...
---
did you play a different FO76 than me? or is this post completely sarcastic? gosh i hope its the second or else id have to say that you are so naiv it cant be worse. this game had the right direction and now made their whole playerbase angry after they already had soooo many problems. this game was a freakin pile of crap when it got released and got ok within the last few months. and then they decided to say "screw everyone" we want fortnite kiddies playing our game and not RPG players who were actually keen on helping to make this game better. this game needed endgame content so badly, that im almost at the point of stopping to play again. AGAIN! the i dont know 4th time now? but everytime that happend they released content that got me at least playing for a few hours more....this time the \*\*\*\*\* with their community in a way that cant be forgiven after we waited so lang for more content, pve content!!! the one and only thing fallout series is based on. \*\*\*\* bethesda and their shitty decicions
---
Your absolutely right lol
---
Looks more like Robo-Pikachu to me.
---
Make the wasteland Pure Again ‚òùÔ∏èüßë
---
I'm still gonna wipe them out. The only good human NPC is a dead human NPC. I'm reminded of a quote from Starship Troopers. "I'm from pre-settler Appalachia and I say kill 'em all!" I hope they do give us an option to decide that Appalachia only belongs to 76ers and we can decide to kill them all
---
You don‚Äôt have to buy a single thing in the Atomic Shop to enjoy the game, unless you want to and the game gives you many ways to earn atoms each day and each week. Those of us who actually play the game know that.
---
I‚Äôm not super interested in it but I‚Äôm also not having a random meltdown. So dramatic. Could be fun. If it isn‚Äôt I don‚Äôt have to play the fucking now do I?
---
i mean its 6/10 everywhere in the world at this point. i think they're probably going to release it close to mid-day today so likely 12:00 EST?
---
No, it doesn‚Äôt. It looks like shit.
---
Maybe they taste better when feeded before? Lol
---
Cannibal Perk. Cannibal Perk never changes.
---
&gt;1 - How often do you see other people in the game?
---
Generally rarely when exploring. There are events where people gather up to complete.
---
&gt;2 - If you die in the game, do you lose your gear? Or just start again from the point before you died.
---
You drop your junk which you can then retrieve. A compass marker is provided. Anyone can take your junk untill then. In survival you also drop some of your aid items.
---
&gt;3 - Is there a situation where you are walking and you see another person, that person is in mid-battle, can you help that person? Do you get 'exp' or loot for helping them?
---
If you do damage to the mob you will also gain experience abd the loot on the mob is instanced to you.
---
&gt;4 - How does dropped loot work in the game if you are with another person, is it first come, first serve or everyone can get the loot?
---
Loot is instanced to you on defeated mobs and containers. Other junk and weapons found in the world are first come but respawn frequently. You can also relog and be put in another instance where the area has not been looted if you are desperate for certain items.
---
&gt;5 - How do clans work in this game?
---
Not yet implemented. Only a friends list for now.
---
&gt;6- Can other players steal your gear after killing you, if so, what kind of gear? Is there a punishment for this? How often does this happen for people? I read a bit about the answers to these question but wanted to see if it has changed. I also read that if only you shoot back they can kill you. What happens if you never shoot back, they keep shooting you and never die?
---
As death in pve situations you drop the junk you have on you at the time. No weapons or armor. In pvp situations you also loose some caps, in game currency. In adventure pvp hardly ever happens and has to be consentual. You get an alert if someone hits you and if you dont want to engage just ignore the mosquito bites. The amount of ammo they would have to spend is enormous to kill you. There is also a pacifist option where you cannot shoot other players by accident in order to prevent accidental pvp chalenges. In survival there are no restrictions. I play adventure and have never been killed by another player as i never fought back as u dont care for it. The only exception is workshops as a pvp area if you want to take over someones shop.
---
&gt;7- I know there is an in-game store which you can spend real money on, but is there a lot of gear you can buy from grinding/in-game currency?
---
No gear. Only cosmetics and the recently added repqur kits.
---
&gt;8- Is this game oriented towards PvP or PvE or both? 
---
Its devided into seperate game modes that you can select when entering the world. Adventure for pve care bares like me, survival for thise who want an unrestrictive pvp experience, abd the new br mode that we will see later today
---
This is such an ingenious idea I wish I had thought of it. I‚Äôm going to give it a download tonight. Thanks bunches m8
---
Any of the enclave events can drop random legendary gear, but mostly armor from what I've seen.  Also the SBQ, player vendors, and the purveyor if you have legendaries to sell for scrip.  The burrows in Harper's ferry usually have a few legendaries in them.  Also drop a nuke on Whitespring Resort and I've always seen at least 10+ legendary enemies there.
---
That would be super dope. It could be like the quest line in fallout 3 where you enter an artificial reality though - also, if these matches are based on their own servers we might be due for private servers in the future!
---
Yeah, there are IT people to pay, servers to keep running, ect.
---
Oh well guess I‚Äôll play it much later than I thought if that‚Äôs the case because 12:00 est is 7 pm here
---
Oh yeah like surprised pikachu, I see that now too lol
---
Time to take all that .38 cal and 10 mil ammo out of my vendor and start distributing it to the newbies.
---
I agree.
---
I think a lot more people will play the survival mode if they do not appear as a target on the map. They should only appear if someone sets a bounty on their head.
---
I don‚Äôt care if there are human npcs in this game much at all. That said I think you‚Äôre expecting there to be a shit ton of them everywhere. Probably hub areas for them and some new random encounters and spawns around the map but they probably won‚Äôt destroy whatever desolate feel you‚Äôre after here
---
Try r/falloutfilthycasuals
---
I was hoping Vault 51 had something to do with aliens, not gonna lie üòÇ
---
but holy shit this BR looks fuckin badass and I am PUMPED
---
Trial?  Are they giving it out for free?
---
/r/AteTheOnion
---
Free random fast travel!
---
About that... Now that you are here let me quickly mark this location on your map.
---
I actively avoid other players, but when I have to interact with "others" I try to limit my time with them.  
---
There's the good, the bad, and then there are the screaming keyboard warriors thumping their chest, oh and the random team invites from the freeloaders wanting to fast travel for free.  
---
Fallout 76 is amazing, not perfect, but nothing is.
---
Except in the other fallout games they didn‚Äôt nerf something‚Äôs and buff others every other month!
---
The older player base (the ones with extra money to spend) don‚Äôt have hours upon hours to play. 
---
I like the crafting aspect of the game.. no way am I going to start a new toon to respec and find/buy 4000 (or however many) plans/recipes again. It seems to be the same old crap that led me quit other games... just get to somewhere I am starting to feel like I am making progress and they move the goalpost.
---
"Fallout 4 style role-player" Lol.
---
You can find it on Spotify now! Look up Copilot Music+Sound!
---
I‚Äôm not a VATs build and nor do I rely on it. But the extra damage from it is nice. I can see VATs getting out of hand with certain builds and legendaries. I don‚Äôt think they should remove it though- just tweak it. Make all VATs cost a flat rate regardless of modifiers. So everyone can get 2 or 3 VATs in. It feels unfallout with out and unrpgish. Don‚Äôt get me wrong- if they leave it out of nuclear winter I could care less and still gunna play the shit out of it. Conflicting statement I know but eh ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
---
I'm done 
---
Seriously
---
Black Ops and now Fallout?
---
Can we get any real content?
---
1: Very often, and in adventure mode, you see them on the map unless they are on stealth stance
---
2: you don't loose gear, but you loose your junk (ie: scrap material for craft). you can get them back, tho, but other people can steal them.
---
3: xp is shared as well as loot
---
4: anyone get a loot (not the same)
---
5: you mean guild? no guild per se for now
---
6: they can steal your junk (cf (2)). however in adventure mod, there is basically no pvp, except in few localized zone. In survival, you also can loose meds and money, but not gear.
---
7: only cosmetic and eye candy. One exception is "repair kit", but you don't need really them, besides, you can get better Repair kits by playing the game.
---
8: adventure mode is PvE, survival is full PvP
---
9: a huge amount of weapon and armor, all custom and moddable. (you need recipe)
---
10: when you start the game it's all quests driven, you can play a huge amount of time just with this. The real end game (200 hours+) is yet to come, it's a bit dull for now. (farming weapon, armor, building camp, challenge etc...)
---
11: mouse (on PC)
---
I use a prime gauss rifle.  Base damage is 630 roughly. But can get up to 1000 a trigger pull if I have a multiple enemies.  SBQ fight I'm doing over 1k damage a trigger pull
---
Lmao.. this is a serious fanboy right here folks.  I‚Äôm calling Howard right now to let him know he should be paying you big bucks for talking points.  Again, you connotation of my statements is exactly what is wrong with gaming communities.  I said Primary game enhancements to imply those features that probably should have been there at release / launch.  Every game has dlc or free content updates throughout its livelihood.  What makes you think I suddenly had an amnesic episode while responding about this game?  It is because such an assumption helps your argument that the OP is a complete ‚Äúidiot‚Äù and nobody should listen to his opinion?
---
All of your statements are founded on common knowledge.. you‚Äôve added nothing to the discussion except an attempt to lambast me for having an opinion that BR is a bad sign for this games future.
---
I get you. You'll also be able to play 'later' likely then, given that they're US based and I think iirc they're EST-based, and that'll likely inform their releases and timetables. It'll probably be mid-day so that it's morning still on the west coast, etc.
---
Look at raw uncommented gameplay, not reviews.
---
They didn't add npcs because people complained. They always planned to add them way before the game was released.
---
Are you serious? You haven‚Äôt even played probably saw youtubers that profit on outrage and now you think fallout 76 is just fortnite. Smh
---
Free Week? Most, if not all of us paid for it, and I don't want my money back.
---
Honesty 0
---
Take my upvote, I learned something new today.
---
Leader of the pack legendaries for every one! I'm gonna farm it and throw level 5 legendary items at the new players! "It's dangerous to go alone, here take this!"
---
Regarding your third point, there are some pretty interesting encounters with other players. Just the other night I was minding my own business, wandering the roads of the forest when another player sent me a message asking me to go to a place called whitesprings. Turns out two level thirties were getting swamped in waves of glowing ghouls so I saved their asses and got some loot and a thank you. I know that alot of media say that 76 is lifeless and empty, but that experience was better than your average fallout quest. Play the free trial with an open mind.
---
Damn you and your trickery...like the others I can't un-see that now.
---
Some things once seen, can never be un-seen.
---
Oh god forbid I want a halfway decent story in my STORY DRIVEN UNIVERSE. Did I ever say those games had no problems? No I didn't. I played the literal worst version of those games on the PS3 then the PC later. I always wonder how much better those games would be with another year. If fallout had waited a year instead of releasing a broken product AGAIN maybe they would have more good will towards them again.
---
That‚Äôs... what most lootboxes are today.....
---
I‚Äôm going to go now lol
---
To answer most of your questions you don't really run into players all too much but they are visible on the map at all times unless they are crouched the only time you see a crowd of players is during a popular event going on or if someone launched a nuke and as far as dying goes when you die you don't lose any of your gear weapons armor etc. The only thing you do lose is all the junk you are carrying, and no can randomly walk up and kill you you need to both agree to PvP by shooting each other however there is a game mode called survival that solely relies on PvP based gameplay no fast traveling and all players are not visible on the map except the top 3 and when you die in this PvP mode you still lose all your junk and a few aid items like stimpacks and such.
---
Food prices are idiotic. EG brain bombs, which are useful and require more ingredients than Mothman omlets are worth less. Cranberry grinders due to their insane requirements (like freaking s‚Äômores) should be more monetarily rewarding to cook.
---
dont play NW then?
---
I hope you are right.  I would rather you be right than me because I wanted this game to succeed.
---
We‚Äôre acting like you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about and be dramatic af
---
Wouldn't it be amazing if one of the quests for the fall update was us helping build an actual radio station?
---
From the 10th to the 17th you can download and play 76 free along with the nuclear winter sneak peak
---
But i need all the cosmetic rewards from it. So im forced to
---
Not forced no, but understand a lot of recipes/loot/cosmetics/maybe even entirely new weapons/armor will all be locked behind it.
---
It‚Äôs about developer priorities.  If you have a product that is released with serious defects, and then see that same company releasing other content for a broken item before fully fixing the broken product..
---
It probably gets you just as upset
---
Aren‚Äôt most loot boxes when you pay money to receive something with a chance of getting different items? At least with this you know what you‚Äôre buying. Not a loot box
---
im planning on picking it up soon saw that the game is only $22 on ebay
---
One word. Dogmeat!!
---
Lol.
---
We'll hopefully all be running around with our puppers come Fall!
---
And yes there is an in game store where you can purchase cosmetic items for your character or your home camp as well as repair kits to easily repair your items on the go atoms can be bought with real money or by doing in game challenges
---
Missed the rest
---
9- Is there a good amount of guns and nice looking armour which you can obtain through the game?
---
There is a decent selection. As always there will be the buest gear for a build as in all mmos
---
10 - In the game, what do you do most of the time, from day-to-day?
---
Mobile decided on small font for some reason.  Sometimes chalenges, grinding for loot. Made an alt recently. Go get plans and decorate my camp a bit. The end game is still lacking a bit but this might vhange with the addition of legendary players system. But after hundereds of hours i still find something that i want to work towards.
---
11- Also, is this game best played with K/M or Controller? 
---
Thats your personal preferance. I use k/m.
---
Whoever is merging their code... He/she should get a long vacation.
---
Somewhere nice and welcoming, I don't wish this person any ill, just remote and with no means to access the codebase... ever again.
---
Damn. Mole rats gonna get me killed in BR I know it
---
I find keto people on this site are like fans of homeopathy they get super toxic when you start asking the right questions eg ‚Äúwe know factually that eating lots of processed meat is very strongly correlated with an increase in digestive cancers, what are you doing to mitigate these risks since many followers of keto are eating a lot of processed meat?‚Äù
---
I don‚Äôt like BR games at all, but with FO76, you can just ignore it. There‚Äôs so much content already to enjoy, you can try it for free. I suspect the BR mode will be just like the pvp mode, you can go play it when you want to, or simply play the main game content. BR doesn‚Äôt define this game.
---
As a PC main, I'd say there's probably  more people on PC but I think you'll be able to play with and meet people on any platform.
---
What lootboxes? You literally don‚Äôt even play this or know what you‚Äôre talking about
---
Exactly what I was going to say! I've been playing it for four days and I love it, the community is amazing in this game! I haven't encountered any major glitches or anything like that, it's been one hell of a ride! I've met some amazing people and they're really nice! I also met a grandma and she built me a bed when I didn't have any resources . 
---
The battle Royale is just an extra mode so you can get cosmetics for the main game. . Sometimes I want to play Fallout 76 ... But like a match.. I don't want to be worried about my food going bad or my radiation levels in my main account... I believe that this is a fun aspect of the game, to spend some 30 or 40 minutes with your friends trying to survive hell.
---
Not anymore. Now we all see a cat!
---
Same reason you get downvoted. Opinions.

I know, I know .... and she came to my aid without a word .... just showed up and started shooting.

They changed it a while back. You don‚Äôt even get slap damage now in pacifist.
---
A cat with his paws on his cheek going ohhhhh
---
Why do you even care they release a game mode that you don't have to play?
---
You get outta here with that reasonable development timeline and promises of a changing world, this thread is for being fake outraged
---
The story needed to progress. How many times were we going to end the SBQ‚Äôs ‚ÄúReign of terror‚Äù with no change to the world? It makes sense that progression means people resettling the area. 
---
As for all the details, nobody knows yet. But having humans come into the area seems like a logical next chapter.
---
Sorry, even if I squint it just looks more mothlike to me.
---
And you can help other players with killing various enemies but looting items is not shared everyone has different items they get from killing enemies or looking containers it's not all the same and you can get quite a few good stuff from enemies
---
https://discord.gg/falloutreddit
---
Might be a good place to start.
---
if you meant something, say it, otherwise you either didn't really mean it, or you're expecting me to read your mind and understand what you're trying to argue.
---
what constitutes 'features' that should have been there at launch is wholly subjective. I, personally, think we've reached that point already with the latest drop of content, and thus it's appropriate for BR to be entering alpha.
---
i'm simply replying because you've given me nothing to prove that you had any knowledge of what you spoke, and even now you haven't - i make no assumptions, i simply argue based on the evidence present of knowledge (or the lack thereof).
---
you can deflect and come back to the 'fanboy' stuff all you want but like, saying 'BR IS A DARK OMEN FOR FALLOUT' just doesn't make any sense and is such a cold, uninspired, alarmist take that i'm surprised i didn't see it on fox news.
---
Exactly what I see!
---
Yes I am extremely excited for wastelanders I never expected them to bring npc!!
---
Hey, i thought you had left your camp on the road north of Flatwoods
---
Wait you get in game shop points from doing challenges? That‚Äôs awesome!
---
it was a particularly fetching little number ... could have been the garb of mysteries but honestly she moved so fast and I was a tad distracted by an awful lot of stags and robots ... no excuse, I know.
---
Following that logic, you must be a prepubescent, since you called me a kiddo.
---
Just get. Stop embarrassing yourself.
---
Some guy: It's easy to make a trailer look good
---
Also that same guy: OMG LOOK AT THE COD TRAILER WOW IT LOOKS SO GOOD I'LL PREORDER IT RIGHT NOW OMFG
---
That's what I'm hoping for. They can do a lot of events related to factions and enemies that are special to certain factions you're a part of. 
---
Hoping that the Responders get bigger, I love their "help everyone" mentality.
---
Basically take the Arktos Pharma basement, make it even *bigger* and apply it to somewhere else
---
BOOM OH GEE A NEW MAP
---
I see it all of the time.  Try sorting by new.  There are days when I‚Äôm upvoting two dozens posts that were at zero within 2 minutes.  IDK if it is bots or just a bored redditor but it‚Äôs very much a thing.

---
And lastly for keyboard and mouse or controller gameplay it's all personal preference whatever you feel comfortable with hope this answers your questions you have about the game I highly recommend getting it
---
the game is great it's free to play this week i think try it
---
If you're on PC, I sell plans at my camp for the low price of 10 caps apiece.
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning)
---
Wow.  I've been super positive about the game and only have a few comments here and there about legit bugs.   And even this one isn't really negative  Just hyped for wastlanders!
---
PC.. because lol @ FPS on consoles...
---
I've been playing since release and never had that wow this game is turning around moment. But when they showed us all the stuff at E3 and the year 2 banner I actually thought yes they are listening and the game will become something great.
---
Put them on the ground with Enforcer perk and a shotgun. Turn them off while they're on the ground for a bit with headshots from the same, then pump the best damage stuff you've got into them. Rinse and repeat if necessary.
---
Enforcer is life-changing for crippling and killing big stuff.
---
I hope they make an Easter Egg based off it
---
Red dress tinfoil hat and fashionable glasses
---
**"but either accept this at face value or walk away."**
---
Or I wont, because you dont get to tell me what to do.  It just so happens this nice fluff piece is coming out right after E3, where it was obvious they are hitting that PR hard in order to regain face.  Without ever really addressing any of the reasons people are mad at them in the first place.  But yeah im sure youre not a shill.  But for **SURE** you're **EXTREMELY** egoistical in the way you present all of this, as if youre the savior of the game.  Talk is cheap Bethesda.  Show me the results, in my hands.
---
It's almost the 11th here and it's still not live in the launcher for me.
---
It's also going to take me around a day to download it, it would be better if they gave us a week to dl/activate and then 7 days from the activation to try it out.
---
Peope on r/fo76 are casuals, they don't give a damn about the lore
---
Hopefully soon :/
---
My newbie question: when does the free trial start and where do I get it?
---
Yh i dont think alot of these people understand how mich development process happens before we see what we see. 5 months ago they didnt go oh shit and quickly made more time to make this. On top of bug fixes. Tweaks, feedback, updates, already planned content and events
---
I'm almost certain that that's going to be a feature. Why wouldn't they include the ability to import time-traveling prostitutes from the future?
---
Lol honestly i‚Äôm impressed they explained nuclear winters that way. Well done, bethesda
---
I have a great suggestion to you, check the free trial week and see if any mode will appeal to you.
---
If not, it's not your game. Fallout 76 was a hit or miss to many players, so you either play it or don't. But at least try it, it may surprise you ... even the dreaded BR mode.
---
Same here dude I was yelling with excitement when they showed wastelanders I just couldn't believe it dude!
---
It‚Äôs about focused development.  My entire point was that it is disappointing they dedicated resources to a cash cow before finishing fixing their base game.  That‚Äôs all
---
I can imagine nothing other than what you found in the match.
---
yeah, they‚Äôre playing it off and working pretty well with such a shitty concept. definitely gonna play
---
"It just works"
---
The trial is for the entire game. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs live yet though.
---
My message for the developers would be. 
---
"Now that I've played this game, I came up with my own conclusion. I love it, it's amazing. Thank you so much for all of your hard efforts on keeping this game alive for years to come since this is a place holder for the newest installments. Maybe, if you could please increase the Atoms we receive from challenges that would be dope!"
---
You say that the majority will be against you, and you are completely right because in this community all you'll find is people that actually played the game and post about it. 
---
You in the contrary , haven't played the game and are judging based on what other influencers tell you, and that is quite sad. Don't be a üêë.
---
The overseers quest never really ends...but when it seems to, you should have at least 8 overseers log holotapes.   There's more after the basement guy, but in areas you probably haven't been yet..
---
Go get the Mysteries quest.  
---
You still have have the rest of what you started at Camp McClintock.
---
Have you started the Pioneer Scout quest?
---
Done the event at Camden Park?
---
Visited Biv?
---
As a PC player the only other thing Im waiting for is mod support and private servers for friends.
---
Dogs? Give Ada back.
---
I hope this is the way it goes. I still need to finish the original main questline, and I don't want a bunch of random NPCs messing with the ambiance of the depopulated wasteland. I recently decided make a new character to run through the game, since my main character was built to play alongside my roommate who kind of bailed on the game.
---
I'm pretty sure that it'll be something like this: You go to the main menu of the game and there will be four different options: Adventure Mode, Survival, Nuclear Winter and Wastelanders. More than likely, Adventure Mode will remain more or less as it is now, taking place during the reign of the Scorchbeast Queen, while Wastelanders takes place a year or so later, with new locations and characters and such.
---
That's why I added the /s. I had played Fortnitw BR + STW since the start of BR until around a year ago, then I stopped. Many people just hate on anything that has to do with BR
---
It‚Äôs only dramatic if you take it that way.  I said I was disappointed.. I didn‚Äôt say I was going to kill my self over it lol.  Your entire premise actually illustrates that YOU have invested emotions in this.. not me friend
---
No more than if you start messing with your current build and it's pretty easy to gear up anyway. My first high charisma toon just used All Rise and PA to get by until a better option came up. Plus I find as you get to a higher level you start hoarding level ups anyway. It's to the point I keep pressing cancel on the perks screen because I'm used to skipping the select screen. I actually like the current respec system because it forces you to think out your character build. Mostly I'd suggest not worrying about it until the content is live.
---
Why? The battle royal is a totally separate mode that won't affect your gaming expierence at all.
---
Somebody else has already posted about something similar, on Xbox I think.
---
Not sure if similar already exists on other platforms, but there's nothing wrong with starting your own either.
---
I‚Äôm just thinking about it but I don‚Äôt see how NPC‚Äôs would work in the world as it is now. A lot of the questlines would be fucked up. It seems like a time jump as well. Idk though ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
You act like I don't want to collect a house full of newbies.  I'm gonna name one Mittens, and one Mr. Fancypants, and one of them is gonna be Bella Bella Dancerella...
---
Drink some ballistic Bock. 15% ballistic weapons damage increase 15% weapon durability damage done 5 mins.
---
Good week to level an alt for free stuff then ;)
---
No you aren't. Wait and buy the loot from other players with a surplus.
---
So i get passive exp? Last night i claimed one. But at the cost of 20 caps. I dont think i can handle claiming every workshop due to few caps i have
---
I loved Howard‚Äôs comment at E3, I‚Äôm paraphrasing but it was basically  ‚Äúwe made a post apocalyptic game where you can do anything you want and instead of going on griefing and killing sprees... you all drop healing stuff for newbies and wave at each other. You give us hope for humanity in case of the actual apocalypse‚Äù
---
Ok, well when they add the lootboxes in a few months, I expect you to come back here and admit YOU don‚Äôt have a clue... like every other BR mode in any other game has.  It‚Äôs a ploy and tactic used by gambling industries as well.  Just wait..
---
All of the marketing around it was based around snow and ice and chills, just look at the current news screen. Seems odd that after all that there's only fire
---
My sarcasm senses are tingling.
---
I don't worry about my K/D ratio, because it's actually great for my level 19 character. I was just experimenting.
---
But I guess measuring epeens is implied in every comment ...
---
I'm neutral on the Battle Royale concept. But I'm really disappointed that the Nuclear Winter update didn't give us winter environments with Rad Blizzards and needing to worry about freezing to death in Appalachia.
---
No one cares about your rants lol we‚Äôve been hearing them since the game started
---
&gt;i don't care if robots die, I don't care if supermutants die. But hey, if Sally NPC needs something I'm gonna do it.
---
Smh it's 2105 and there are still Human supremacists around /s
---
It seems a wise choice for BR mode, possibly survival.
---
Not so much adventure.
---
I do I‚Äôm disgusted. You sat down and wrote a long winded post about a game you don‚Äôt play and said multiple things here in this thread that aren‚Äôt true. It is a free update you don‚Äôt have to play and *there are no lootboxes you gullible fool*.
---
I think the Flatwoods Monster works for that one.
---
We will see how they roll those out.  It could be either way, but the current BR trend is randomized or at least partially random hybrid models
---
Probably a bit of both. Watching the trailer, it looks like the crashed space station gets rebuilt as a great big raider community, so I would imagine that going there you'll see a bunch of them doing their thing. I also suspect that in many of the places where we used to see scorched running around there will be raiders and whatnot now.
---
I was also looking forward for that but look at what we got
---
Fuck them, too.
---
Literally no information has come up about loot boxes. Not gonna happen bud
---
If lootboxes are added to BR you better come back here and admit it.  Considering every other game has done just that.
---
Nuclear Winter is coming.. there is no time for bug fixes..
---
do you bethesda at all ?
---
Yeah that's the way it is with online for the most part sadly. But I'm now subscribed here and can hopefully see/get some tips. Everyone seems super friendly here :)
---
I'm pretty sure Nuclear Winter is only the BR mode. The new quests and challenges will come later this year with the Wastelanders DLC
---
What if making a BR is easier/faster than making Wastelanders functional?  I would rather have a BR that I‚Äôm not likely to play if it means the extra time spent on Wastelanders means it is properly fleshed out.
---
You guys know what nuclear winter actually is right? Fire storms trigger cooling. It‚Äôs representative of the flames in the mode.
---
I'm with you. A fellow PvP hater fawning over a PvP mode does nothing to make something inherently unappealing to me, more appealing. It's like someone saying they'll put sprinkles on their hand before they slap me. Hugely disappointed that this is where the post lead.
---
With this in mind the whole thing should be set at the Whitespring.
---
He's telling the truth, I know this because I was one of the 10.  He pretty much sums it up well.
---
Just to be clear, is it a *plan* for the coat or just a single one?  I'd assume it's a plan, but those repair kits are going to be locked to a specific character so that makes me wonder.
---
You‚Äôre the most dramatic fool around
---
What perk cards are you using for this?
---
You know this is an ONLINE mulitplayer game right?
---
*Ignorant drama queen*
---
Thanks man who use iTunes anywhere?
---
But Lone Wanderer 3 costs 4 points in Charisma, doesn't it?
---
1 it depends on where you are
---
2 if you die you lose all junk items but one survival you lose all junk and some aid items
---
3.If some one is fighting you can help and they will either talk to you or just walk away. If you want you can let them fight by themselves and die or finish the battle themself
---
Tip if they are alot higher of a level than you than they might just want to kill it themselves cuz your bullets do nothing to the thing they are fighting
---
4. If you ki something only u get the loot but everyone that shoots the creature than they all get the loot. When searching box's everyone gets different loot from those boxs for loot on tables or on the ground only one person can get that loot but it comes back later
---
5. I'm the leader of my faction and it all depends on who u r playing with because (sadly)  there is no system for factions yet
---
6 if u are on adventure mode and someone shoots you just ignore them cuz they can't hurt u and if they do hurt u they get a bounty of caps on their head and everyone sees the bounty and whoever kills the person than they get all the caps. And no you don't drop gear just junk
---
7. Yeah gear in this game is u can buy it from the vender that human players can set up at their camp or from robot venders in the game or the supermunat that walks with his brahmin moo moo
---
8. This game 8f you play adventure mode it is PvE in survival mode it is more of a PvP and with nuclear winter its a PvP thing
---
9 there is alot of armor that u can find for ex. You can get civil war outfits, ski, mascot, and more outfits just gotta look and for guns it's the same way New guns like the black powdered pistol and other type of weapons 
---
10 if none of the people I play with r online I build my camp up or just spend time doing story. 
---
11. I have never tried it with K/M but I bet it is easier cuz u don't want to use stimpaks unless u break bones cuz u have food and healing salves that you can use and food spoils quick so cook as soon as you can and always have the perk card Good With Salt on
---
12. If u play on ps4 add my faction community " The United Virginian Front" I'll add you and teach u how to play. 
---
Some tips
---
Explore all of the Dorset before going any where else 
---
Scrap all junk before putting in stash cuz that saves stash weight 
---
With power armor if u find one that is to high of a level but u want to have it just go to transfer grab the pieces than enter the power armor frame than put the peices on the frame wait a few minutes and the power armor will go to ur inventory and weighs 10bpounds even with all the peices on it if the power armor is your level u can just collect the armor and it goes into ur inventory if you forget to pick ur power armor and it on the ground it's fine no one can come and claim it its ur yours and it will go back into your inventory after a few minutes 
---
Make sure u get alot of carrying compacity 
---
Melee everything u can at first 
---
Don't use stimpaks unless u really need to just collect soot flowers and bloodleave and boil some water and u can make some healing salve just use those to heal urself and food mutt chops are good but wheigh one pound each favorite the food and healing salve so u can use them without going in ur pipboy
---
With vats they are good they are like aimbot with alot of perception u can hit almost all ur shots
---
When leveling up you pick ur attribute and the perk card so make sure before u pick ur card that u enter through the attribute that u want
---
If u come across some annoying players u can just leave the world and enter in a another world but most people r nice and this week alot of people are excited for new players cuz new friends and new people to help or for the players that r raiders that means new people to trick
---
If u trade with someone if they ask for a fist bump or anything don't do it they will punch u back and u will enter PvP and they can use their turrents on u and steal all ur junk unless it put away. 
---
U can wear ur vault suit under armor and wear an outfit over all of that 
---
Mods on weapons cannot be taken off and put on another weapon the mod just gets scraped and u wasted materials to make something else
---
Ore that u find needs to be turned into the the actual thing in a chemistry station
---
Lock ur water purifiers in ur bukld mode so people don't take ur water
---
Lock ur doors if u don't want people in ur house
---
Don't get attached to a weapon because u will find better ones so be ready to switch 
---
If u find a gas mask wear it in the bottom of the map below the forest in the ashheap or u will risk lung disease if u don't believe u will find out
---
Don't go into the nuked areas until u have a full set of power armor and use some rad x
---
U can get mutations which are super good or fun but rad away and the machines that get rid of rads can get rid of ur mutation so if u get a potion that gives u a mutation save it and don't drink it till u get the perk that let's u keep ur mutitation. 
---
Dont be scared to talk to other players u will make new friends and they will help u through the wasteland 
---
Grow mutfruits, corn, and tatos for an adhesive farm and make vegetable starch in the cooking station than scrap the vegetable starch to get adhesive 
---
Always store ur junk when u get a chance to
---
U can fast travel to vault 76, ur camp, and to ur teammates for free
---
Don't build a huge base at the start of the game cuz u will need a stash box alot so make sure u can build ur camp any where u r so u can make a stash box and store it
---
U only get xp for killing an enemy as long as u take on shot on it and it hits
---
Run from scorchedbeast and fast travel away from them they r not worth killing it just waste ammo and gives crap loot
---
Last tip that I can think off have fun.
---
Science !
---
Yup! Been playing since launch and have bought everything I want from the shop, have not spent a single penny!
---
I'm fairly certain that you can explore vault 51 in adventure mode. They mention a quest you have to do to get there, there also rooms you unlock the higher your overseer rank.
---
YEsS! It's gonna be fun af.
---
That would kill this game. They can‚Äôt slowly roll out fixed while leaving it with nothing to do.
---
If you can‚Äôt even then just don‚Äôt.
---
Incentives to play this mode are low. You get some cosmetic clown costumes or similar as a reward that has no use.
---
I have my bethesda boner growing... But it's shy, it's been hurt before..
---
I was feeling unstoppable, Me and my newly modified pipe rifle, then I saw it, ‚Äúha! A critter just five levels above me, piece of cake‚Äù.
---
That was my very first death in this game.
---
What Mindset? That I expected a Groupquesting system in an multiplayer RPG? More precisely in a Fallout Legacy Game? Are you for real? I want to play it, what I don't want is to experience the same quest fourth times ESPECIALLY in a Group.
---
Did you experience it? I'm not talking about the loot/survival aspects... I'm talking about ordinary quests.
---
"Okay I gave Sanchez the Fluxcompensator, now we must head to the airport""huh my questlog still says that we have to defend the lab?""What we already have, that was 2 quests ago""I know I was there but it seems I had to talk to Dr. Richards""What but I talked to him already you were standing right beside me?" Third and fourth player: Oh I taught we were just killing stuff....
---
Do you know how frustrating that is in a game that lacks a basic chat function? I wasn't expecting a good single player RPG but at least I expected a good multiplayer RPG and that was the reason I asked because I really want to enjoy it. Borderlands streamlined basic groupquesting 10 years ago and Baldurs Gate did it over two decades ago. But hey f me, right? 
---
Fo76 Community: Be kind and helpful to each other. 
---
Random Redditor: Is this specific thing still lacking basic functionality? 
---
Also the Fo76 Community: Go away. You have the wrong mindset.
---
Yep. said this day 1.
---
They must release all their games in Pre beta then
---
Nah, you all get boosted up a rank
---
My gut reaction to the pic is that it's just a skin for T-51.
---
I have total confidence that Besthesda is going to totally fuck up, despite all thier weird choices and nerfs, and make fallout 76 a really good game.
---
Well a game release is a thing (and I get your complaint), this is a free mode, so I don't see any issue at all with it
---
Thank you kind sir, this is exactly what I was looking for.
---
So why is the guy gold panning? I need this information, is it a new way of resource gathering in WV?
---
I wouldnt be surprised when the Companion takes up a Slot in your Team. So Basically you and a Buddy and 2 Companions. So 3 Players and 1 Companion.
---
Also with the Companion I do think I would makes sense that lone wanderer gets disabled. Althoug I would like that It wouldnt be.
---
Thank you I‚Äôll check it out after class and hopefully gain some insight
---
But we wont get to see that cooling
---
This is planned already. In the roadmap [here](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019), ctrl+F "prestige".
---
You can check the system requirements on the bethesda launcher I think.
---
Yongyea got his clutches deep inside you...it's pretty clear you have no clue how the game actually plays if this is what you're talking about.
---
what?
---
pikachu
---
Old
---
So where's my Heavy Incinerator at? Damnit, I want to be able to violently and thoroughly roast my enemies with a flaming cannon again!
---
Level 370. Plays every single day. I figure Bethesda thinks you‚Äôve gotten your moneys worth regardless. Just my opinion. Not taking up for them
---
Thanks a lot, this helps a lot! Do more people play Adventurer?
---
I'm going to say ditto to your entire post.
---
This was the plan all along. No NPCs was just the beginning.
---
It's more like a close friend of mine told me stuff like this, I rarely rely on Youtube for information. That's why I asked you guys how things really are, you stuck with the game for a long time so you really know the truth about it.
---
For F's sake, the "week" for EVERYTHING else EVER starts on Tuesdays.
---
Hiring voice actors and creating dialogue trees, NPCs in game, questlines, and a new Main Quest are not things done lightly or this quickly either. 
---
It also shows that they have zero confidence or care about their "no human NPCs" concept. 
---
What's more realistic. Someone at Bethesda came up with a moronic concept of "lets have a survival rpg with NO npcs" and the top brass at Bethesda loved it and said "go for it"? 
---
or
---
They rushed a game, cut out NPC content because it wouldn't be done in time, and came up with an excuse for it's lack? 
---
Given the half-baked state of the game at launch, I'm going to say the latter is more realistic. I mean, they ran out of time to implement any sort of chat or friend networking systems (like guilds or shared build spaces) that are critical to any multiplayer online game. 
---
And it's not like they're trying hard to appeal to the current player base. If they were, they'd fix loot, make sure big monsters were actually worth fighting, and they'd find ways to make PVP more palatable. Not fix stuff that was demanded by the scores of players (myself included) who left. 
---
For example: how much of the player base is actually clamoring for a battle royale mode?
---
So, don't post to it if you don't care. Obviously it's beneath you. Move along.
---
This is the sort of stuff I like to hear! Thanks!
---
Good, so no really op shit brought over
---
I'm pretty sure you won't have to fight through the BR to get to adventure mode. Where the NPC's are..
---
Just like Survival...
---
If you are used to playing in VATS then that's going to be a jarring experience.
---
Yeah, that's why I asked you about the state of the game before jumping to conclusions.
---
Perk cards are confirmed to not go between.
---
Yeah, I really hope they don't force players into that mode for new game content and rewards, too, but I'm not optimistic üòï
---
Looks like a cartoony bat to me with two little fangs
---
Wow, I can‚Äôt believe we missed that. Seems odd that Bethesda would drop that without even a Tweet to advertise it.
---
I don't have numbers but a lot of players are in adventure mode for sure
---
I'm not a BR type of person, so I don't really have a ton of interest in the new game mode. I hope some other stuff gets added to the game for those of us that don't really want to be Overseer. I think the trailer looked so cool and the concept I'm sure will be loads of fun for those interested. I'll be a little disappointed if there isn't anything else added before Fall for the casual players. But, Wastelanders is going to be LIT.
---
"One step ahead of the game isn't a plan, kid." - Hannibal, A-Team
---
So it took a year, but they're finally actually implementing a real game via update?
---
Walking arsenal - reduces weight of ALL weapons
---
Would be nice to bring that back :(
---
Silent Hill?
---
Don't believe the hype.
---
I'm soooooo happy to have dialogue options back. Especially options that are SPECIAL based.
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs content in the sense of story/gear.  It looks to me like it will only be xp/caps and cosmetics like the PA skins. 
---
So if you want those skins, you need to play the mode. It‚Äôs no different than skins only through the atom shop. If a player doesn‚Äôt want to spend money on atoms for the skins, they still have the same use and enjoyment of the game as it is
---
They said you unlock perks for the nuclear winter mode. As in, they made it sound like once you unlock it you can start the next matches with them already equipped
---
If that's the case, Im very excited! Hopefully some cool new PA skins
---
Yes LOL
---
people with camps full of low level stuff near the vault are going to make bank this week...
---
#**SNEAK 100**
---
FUCK YEAH, if i dont loose anything and gain stuff, hell yeah i am going to play it
---
Maybe some new perks will be added to both, we can wish
---
I‚Äôd guess 1pm EST as that‚Äôs when they usually roll out updates.
---
Thanks for all your replies. Really appreciate it. Can you obtain cosmetics and furniture through the game and not store?
---
I doubt it will stuff that gameplay changing, skins and maybe guns like survival mode are all I'm gonna think will be new
---
More than.. Still generally enjoyable with the people I play with, but there are more than a few ongoing frustrations that come up as I know everyone that's played is aware.
---
I'm pretty sure there aren't any prereqs! You just have to make it to vault 51 first :)
---
There has never been a challenge against other people in the series. How can that be a staple? This is the first fallout game to allow any multiplayer interaction, unless you count fallout tactics
---
I must be wired up the wrong way, because I'm not getting any of this hype - how is having human NPCs any different than having robot NPCs?
---
So now we can go visit old Great Great Great Grandpappy Preston at Anchor Farm and he can tell us to go wandering all over the Wasteland defeating enemies and collecting shit instead of... say Rose, or the Overseer, or a holotape of Liz Taggerdy, or a drunken robot, or the Ghost of Fucking Christmas Past telling us to go wandering all over the Wasteland defeating enemies and collecting shit... what's the difference?
---
But I can use Charisma this time! To do what? Will the outcome of every conversation be anything other than "Help This person - Kill This Person - Walk Away"?  Where's the role playing in that?
---
Be a Raider/Don't Be a Raider looks like the main thrust of the update. Everything else is just going to be exactly the same game loop of Go Here - Kill Things - Loot Shit... which, don't get me wrong, is ok. It's just not this incredible, beautiful vision that everyone is vomiting rainbows about.
---
To be fair that's because pvp isn't possible without the other persons consent, if you could just dome another play at will the game would be a lot different - but then again the play base would be too
---
Uh... You do realize that NPC's have been in Fallout 76 since day one?... When did the term "Non Player Character" mean only human like NPC's?
---
NPC's are nothing new to 76
---
&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning
---
Ah, very helpful. Thanks.
---
Cool
---
What i mean: Knowing what does what I in a computer, how to navigate the programs, and figure out how to fix what's not working. All of which I'm inept at.
---
I'll be trying it today, thanks.
---
"we" dont have to do anything
---
Dunno about you, but I couldn't care less about cosmetics or similar tacky shit; I play for fun &amp; thrills and it looks like there's plenty to be had.
---
Yeah, once you realize that it seems like a good thing all the way around. I was told that in between posting and commenting, that's why the comments kinda differ from my post. I do still hope they have an option to have a Free-staters mindset and make them leave/kill them. I suspect there's more than two options to help/hurt them
---
Food and water too!  Im overloaded with so much stuff that if I get lower level legendaries I try to hunt players down that can use them.
---
Enclave personnel will shoot when they see fit. We won't listen to a raider dog when enforcing laws and taking taxes for our Government
---
It seems like you have this pretty well thought out. I've not really anything useful to add, but I am curious how you manage to keep your health at a certain percentage. Do you just sustain radiation damage and not bother to get rid of the rads?
---
Edit: I don't really engage in pvp myself, but I am curious about people's builds. Mostly so I know what meta builds are gonna come and try to slaughter me in the future, lmao.
---
I don't think Wastelanders will be a separate game mode at all. Its confirmed to be changing the main quest line so I'd assume its not a mode
---
Its going to be pretty funny this week with the flood of free players, the great newb invasion of 2019 begins now, prepare your defenses.  Because if you dont know, free to play attracts ALL the griefers.
---
But so many other developers in the last 5 years have done just that...
---
Don't let the battle royal mode keep you from playing. Sure there are alot of bugs, but if you don't want to play battle royal you don't have to. It's just for the people that enjoy it. If you haven't played the game do the free trial,and if you still don't like it don't play it, but if you do enjoy playing than buy it don't let what you have heard steer you away from the game.
---
It's gonna be cosmetics most likely, maybe a few legendary guns like survival challenges
---
I think the hatred for bethesda and todd howard has gotten out of control if i'm being honest, I get the criticism for f76 at launch as given it's current state deserved it but seeing people saying "Bethesda / Todd should burn in hell" is just going too far. 
---
I just feel bad for them because they make great games and this one was too ambitious even for them and they had a difficult time with it's creation. I'm happy to hear it's gotten some good content and important patches where it's better and fun. 
---
Also creation club coming out with cool new content makes me happy for both FO4 and Skyrim :)
---
Thanks for this. So you can obtain Atoms in the game (through grind, missions, etc.) to spend in the in-game store?
---
I just moved out of the forest and into the mire.  If it wasn‚Äôt for how much trouble rebuilding was I‚Äôd move back.
---
I'll say that's highly unlikely unless you had hundreds of thousands of ammo.
---
Just a jab at people selling outrage. A ton of flat out wrong information floating around about this game.
---
You're welcome!  Where did you set up?
---
i just hope the dialogue options actually carry some weight, not just the npc making a happy or sad face depending on the choice
---
Of course you can there are many different crafting plans for you to obtain to make your home camp unique and different clothes out in the wasteland for you to pick up as well the in game atom shop just has the more fancy stuff for your camp
---
I would greatly appreciate the help. I just built a PC this weekend and bought 76 after watching the Wastelanders trailer.
---
I've noticed that communication in consoles seems better, because of the general player base has mics turned on. Note that this have downsides as well.
---
But as a PC player I can only enjoy the game with a mouse and a keyboard. Also if you have the time and platforms, you can check all communities, before you decide. Just create dummy accounts.
---
Yes they do, I bought one of them.(the action hero) for like 1.5k
---
It'll start today, with free week thingie and nuclear winter pre-beta
---
&gt; pure corporate greed
---
Watch the IGN interview from 35 to 50 minutes to see why you're wrong
---
&gt; most minimal amount of content for the maximum amount of dollars possible
---
So giving out a $60 game and promising years of free updates is minimal work  now? That's exactly my point, we have people like you throwing around visceral rage despite clearly having no idea what you're talking about. You're the problem
---
I try to find lower levels to give common plans to.
---
Name one.
---
I have killed the queen so many times I have about 115 improved repair kits and I only use about 500 rounds of ultra .50 cal. That is 4 or 5 ammo crafts that's it. Find a good group to play with and it's a cake walk.
---
As someone who is going to be playing the free trial and most likely end up buying the game, how do these booths work? is it actually like a proper shop or are they still in your inventory and you say over voice what you have and then just drop it for the person to pick up etc....
---
Bare minimum apology and acknowledgement of the toxicity crying community isn't really something to applaud.
---
Yes everyone knows that.
---
I stepped away from this for a while..not because I didn't like the game.. Simply because I had a move to deal with then other games started coming out, etc. I may just start from scratch. I'll be hopping back in sometime tonight.
---
When its day time in the us. 
---
Think about it
---
Wastelanders is more than likely not a separate game mode.
---
I think they nerfed the one shot guns like dragon cause mine suck lol
---
I‚Äôve lost several weapons and armors from my stash. Really only noticed it when I took several days off from playing. RIP my quad explosive combat shotgun.
---
When I watched the wastelanders trailer I'm pretty sure I noticed a raider enemy in there
---
I appreciate this comment.  Perhaps my loathing of BR is keeping me from seeing the other positives.. it‚Äôs a game mode that has become synonymous with micro transactions which are out of control.  As I said in my OP, I had been considering making the jump until they announced BR and I was curious if others felt the same way and were disappointed.  If anything, some of he disingenuous redditor comments on here makes me feel as if the online community in the game will be just as toxic.. which will certainly deter me more than BR would
---
Kiddo isnt an insult there bud. Not really the same. You're hilarious.
---
TLDR: "We're going to make Fallout76 a fallout game"
---
I initially thought this game would have a redemption arc then after the first few updates kept being a mess, gave up on it. Then when they kept trickling little DLCs I figured that was the end. This really surprised me. I would love to see this game end up something special.
---
Raiders have honor
---
I was doing Line in the Sand with 3 other randoms and one of them just kept hopping between all of us requesting to trade. I was like BRO. FIGHT THIS SCORCHBEAST NOW. TRADE LATER.
---
After the 3rd time he requested to trade with me mid-event, I dropped a "no" emote and he replied with a "confused" and a punch. 
---
Some people.
---
I'm going to check it out, just so I can say I did
---
I believe they said something like 70 new perks, 10 of which are exclusive to NW? Walking arsenal was an example of one of the perks that can not be brought back though, so that one is definitely not going to be in adventure mode
---
Yeah, I get radiation until I‚Äôm at 20% HP
---
Pray that the servers stay up while 50+ players lag on the screen.
---
Fallout 76 :3 Edition
---
&gt;Bethesda Isn't (completely) a faceless monster devouring our money   
---
that's just  Todd Howard
---
Marvellous. I will be trying the game out today, and based on these replies I will love it and buy it afterwards.
---
Geez! Big if true!
---
Let me mark your map...
---
I'll stomp the Enclave when I'm done putting the Brotherhood in their place.
---
Pick any EA game with BR.  BFV is one I‚Äôm still waiting for the bulk of loot purchases to come out as the game mode is still new there.
---
Ooh, lah-dee-dah, look at Mr Stash Space here, must be nice to have some of that "space" stuff you clever folk seem to have coming out of the wazoo
---
Oh okay! I figured that's what it was but wasn't sure if there was some other thing I was missing in the meta conversations I've been ignoring until recently. Thanks!
---
This happened to me after the sheepsquatch update. I haven't been able to find another spot as great as that one since.
---
I try to help, but they need to be people that accept bugs, glitches, crashes, etc.
---
I‚Äôm not afraid they don‚Äôt like the game, I‚Äôm afraid they don‚Äôt like the technical issues.
---
I kinda get the feeling he thinks respawning is going to be a thing.
---
We'll see about that, punk
---
I will feed them Nukashine.
---
Oh my camp is right there. If I don't get kicked out of my spot, trade business will be booming.
---
While not really a BR, GvG in Runescapes Wilderness is the only similarity I can think for this.
---
Anything else, in this case, is NPCs, dialog choices and a new main storyline as well as new power armor its hardly like the main game is getting passed over here.
---
Yeah weird, it was almost like they hyped the game up only to release literal garbage, made MULTIPLE HUGE mistakes (really on purpose so not a mistake), and have never really apologized or admitted their misdeeds outside of Todd Howard saying, 'oopsie we deserve the hate teehee'.
---
No, the game did not change in any way over the past six months. It's completely identical to launch. Ignore what anybody tells you about a roadmap of content or bimonthly updates, that would be silly. Why would a live service game get updates?
---
Vault raids, the other mode thats coming with the nuclear winter update
---
Look, I'll be honest here. I'm not really interested in your childish back and forth.
---
So let me know *if* you ever have anything valuable to say.
---
Hey, good talk.
---
so you basically have to f\*\*k up your perfect build in order to be able to trigger certain stuff on NPCs....wow what a great idea!   
---
this system worked in other fallouts because u had way more options and were not freakin bound to those perk cards + the extremely limited points system. its like bethesda paid 10 y/o who dont think at all. so nope this is crap
---
Too little too late
---
&gt; That said, I've personally "bet my job" more than once by shortcutting the red tape and just fracking implementing the fix.
---
Lots of us do that - but you better be damned sure of the fix you make, or you get yourself BBQd.  :)
---
Don‚Äôt worry, a bloodied build will kill it in half a hit.
---
Should I put /s? Not sure.....
---
Well, fallout 76's support didn't die so it can be the best fallout game ever to exist. For now it's better than NV roleplay wise
---
Same. Hopefully we don't get kicked. I'm gonna stock the crap out of my vending machines if I get to stay.
---
Another quick tip when you do have your camp all set up don't worry about some griefer coming over and shooting your place up and destroying it other players cannot damage any of your camp structures unless he or she is in PvP with you
---
Just try it tmo, West tek crashes frequently for me on Xbox
---
Oh good I see this community is Star Citizen level of cult like now.  Just because someone criticizes the game, doesn't make it invalid criticism.
---
Who asked for BR mode? I play 76 to avoid the bevy of games jumping on the BR mode trend.
---
I see what you mean. Npc's will be a great additionbut the same people who want them will hate the game in another way.
---
When daily challenges refresh
---
Would love the option to put stickers of our pets on our power armour
---
You will still be able to expierence the world as it has been for us so far. Except for any changes made to improve the performance of a game. Like you won't ever have to expiernce how small the stash size was originally.
---
They're stringing together things and calling it a plan. It's actually pretty funny to watch.
---
I am my own faction
---
They finally added that post to the wiki?  Nice!
---
Many of those 52 will die off fairly fast.
---
**ELDER MAXSON'S BATTLECOAT? THEY ADDED FUCKING ELDER MAXSON'S BATTLECOAT?!?!?**
---
**AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH**
---
Which is why I assumed the Bloodied Explosive would help that with the extra 20% Nerd Rage, Adrenal Reaction (20 or 25%) and I think Bloodied weapons give like 75-80% more weapon damage with being at 20% then of course a Psycho will be more than enough to one shot with a dragon lol
---
Yep we look after the noobs. I have 3 characters (You can have 5) and my level 5 keeps getting level 200 players giving me free building plans, water, ammo etc. I'm appreciative and take the items because I know how rewarding it is to help the noobs lol even though I actually have a higher level character than them.
---
Dope! I hope you get them the classic way, not through playing nuclear winter(other than the exclusive to nuclear winter ones)
---
Lol that is very true and my only concern.
---
If you‚Äôre not gonna use explosive weapons you could slide the PU points into luck of the draw as heavy weapons break a bit faster and heavy lasers break a moderate amount faster.
---
Very helpful and good to know. Thanks.
---
yeah, my guess is that we got 10 mins to leave51 and find a gun or something, then we start combat and the storm comes. So it‚Äôs probably the whole map, but most people will be near 51
---
I'm glad to see they cared for and stuck with the game, compare this to anthem and it really does show the difference
---
The community. We have sat here and begged for a PvP mode that works since day 1. This BR is what we have been asking for: No vats, no legendaries, no mutations and open PvP.
---
Yes.  You just rad up to force your health pool to shrink.  It actually synchronizes very well with radiation perks like ghoulish and radicool because of this.  It's a slippery slope though, you get addicted to the big numbers and end up radding yourself into being one shot lol
---
Is this a ranged main joke that i'm too unarmed to understand?
---
You're welcome hope you enjoy the free trial welcome to the wasteland
---
That's a good tip, thanks!
---
"What are you doing?"
---
"I'm kicking my ass!"
---
Your post says "they didn't add NPC's at the beginning"... Then you follow that post with one stating "everyone knows that" when I point out that NPC's have been there since the beginning...
---
Not sure if you are confused or just trolling, but your replies contradict eachother
---
I've seen a few of these, and a friend has one as well, it's hilarious, glad you saw the humor in it, some get upset.
---
Several players in my regular group are Bloodied builds and were complaining to one guy that they always spawned in right next to his Rad Shower, and lost their Rads, so he replaced the Shower with radiation emitters and let them all know that the Rad shower was moved, the result was awesome, we laughed about it for days.
---
I told him he should put a sign next to it that reads: "Junk Extractor"
---
Pretty sure it'll be available with the added content later today. 
---
I mean, they made a new graphic and everything. Probably should have waited until they updated the Atom shop to make sure.
---
Maybe they'll give it to you anyway, or refund the purchase?
---
So dont play and move on
---
"They changed it and I don't want to deal with the new situation! I will still bravely keep enjoying this video game however; and I will keep up my war against minority groups no matter how vocal!!"
---
Next week's challenge is:
---
Take a picture of someone taking a picture of an Alien taking a picture of someone wearing a swimsuit and a tinfoil hat as they leave Vault 76.
---
It's rough being an older gamer and watching your favorite games turn into empty shells.
---
Well there seem to be some great game devs coming up with great content and they keep adding shit but the servers, the engine, it's all not capable of handling it, I canna hold 'er together, Cap'n, she's going to blow!
---
You can say that again.
---
I am
---
I‚Äôm just disappointed it is 52 players and not 51 like the vault number.
---
You are an asshole who straight up doesn't know what the fuck they are talking about. I know people with HIGH END computers who see the very same glitches I see. we see ghouls sliding around on floors. It's not our systems, jerk
---
pikkachu anyone?
---
Its not "out" yet, AFAIK no time has been given so it could be in an hour or couple of hours
---
link to your podcast?
---
Lol pain is real
---
I hope everyone realizes this is the great double edge sword of online games.  Have you asked yourself why the in game community is so friendly?  If you thought about it, I bet a big reason it has been this way is because those who have stuck it out, wanted to make sure not to drive anyone away who does happen to start playing, in hopes they stay and the game doesn't die off.  So basically small community + trying to keep people playing + fewer trolls = Good community.
---
HOWEVER this WILL change if/when this game gets a lot of new players.  So I hope you're all prepared for that, because you will be replaced with all the rust, ark, etc players.  Just being nice to new players this week will not stop the change, you will only be seen as weak and easy prey to these types of players.  Or if youre not outright replaced, you will become what you hate.
---
The point of my post was that I was planning on giving it another shot and seeing how others felt about it and about BR.
---
It‚Äôs obvious from the few talking heads in here that this reddit is overloaded with people are become triggered anytime someone doubts the game
---
Hey, Im working on a new character thats level 31 too! My psn is alooftreasure, if you see me on we could run some events and farm some ghouls
---
Yes, I was quite hopeful about seeing actual winter. Couldn't they have just called it "Firestorm" or something?
---
Thank you, I am excited!
---
Wow you ok? You know exactly what kind of npcs I'm talking about
---
Alright sweet next time I‚Äôm on I‚Äôll give you an add
---
Is this available in Asia? It's not available for download.
---
Early on adhesive, screws and metal are critical and in short supply.  You can get all of the crops you need to make an adhesive farm at the Morgantown airport which is an early destination if you follow the main quest lines.  Charleston Capital building is a good place to get screws early on. 
---
After lvl 20 armor calls for ballistic fiber which is found in Camp McClintock (early area that is a must stop) and Fort Defiance which is in a higher level area.
---
Learn your farming routes.  Servers restock every 20 hours so if you find that server hopping ( literally leaving the world and getting on a new server) isn‚Äôt helping you find what you need do something else.  If you need help ask in the subs.
---
Before level 50 you will be ditching equipment quickly enough that you shouldn‚Äôt become attached to any non legendary gear you find.  
---
When you do the ‚ÄúMistress of Mysteries‚Äù quests DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES THROW OUT, SCRAP OR TRADE THE GEAR YOU GET FROM THIS QUEST.  It s all upgradeable at benches and early on the gun/sword are very useful.  If you toss it out you cannot get it again.
---
For perks I consider things that reduce weight to be very useful as well as ‚ÄúGood Doggy‚Äù which makes canned dog food a very useful food option.
---
Yeah we know we're also getting two more vault openings for high level raids and the legendary player system.
---
Don‚Äôt waste time with people that don‚Äôt like you, you should use all that time with people that like you.
---
For now at least, time is a precious resource.
---
That‚Äôs what I try to do and always advise.
---
I'm more intrested in what looks like the plasma caster the guy on the left has.
---
y‚Äôall so anal about this game
---
They did say "Starting **tomorrow**".
---
Its not daytime in the US yet, you know, where the developers live.
---
you should link your Podcast....it is pretty funny :)  
---
Stupid Chad and his immortality!
---
And they could rename the game Battlefield V
---
IDK lunch can be pretty amazing ;)
---
Ya I've been doing keto for 5 weeks (healthy keto) tons of veggies and whole foods and meats.   I ask questions like "hey is my bile gonna be ok and my liver with this much fat?" Abs literally got shit for asking the question ans got called a hypochondriac for being worried about possibly getting liver disease in 20 years.  Just a simple fucking question.  Then the moderators literally locked me out of my own posts because of me pushing back on these fools.  Needless to say I ain't visiting that thread anymore
---
Honestly...the only thing im scared to death of is there will be a glitch/bug that permanently strips our inventory and it deletes all our on person's  invintory be it armor, weapons and aid going back and forth from the modes on our mains lol with weapons and stuff disappearing in the past its freakin a scary thought.
---
I could definitely see them as random events, maybe even a battle where you get to choose which side to help!
---
No the ash heap vault
---
I thought so as well, but this makes the mod redundant. And with the addition of Nukashine's randomised spawn locations, the squad will probably will be teleported there. And since they have loading screen, it's probably that.
---
Well... I'm almost certain that name is taken ;D
---
Thanks for the name of locations and the rest of the information too!
---
Lol, yeah. While I don't wholly agree that the engine and especially the server aren't capable of handling it, they certainly do have several fatal flaws. It can all be fixed, but with as much effort as it takes to fix the core parts of this engine that have created these flaws, you might as well make a better engine. 
---
Bethesda have instead gone with the ostrich approach. I can't hear you complain about these flaws if my head is deep enough in this sand.
---
That's correct.
---
So would the Responders be in the side of the Brotherhood, or nah? 
---
Wheres my fellow Responders at?
---
I get what ur saying I think. You don't wanna soften them up. All of us had to scrape n crawl our way through the wastes, and it's what's made us strong. If we give the newbs food and gear that they didn't have to struggle for, they will never learn how to fend for themselves.
---
Oh god they won't know what survival mode is and will be thrashed to pieces lol
---
Ooh fk me haha launch*
---
It's still gonna be the game we enjoyed before, but it is going to be pretty different. I'm mostly posting this so Bethesda sees that some players want to keep that empty feeling. Plus why would they make Free States a faction and not give us an option to make sure nobody touches our shit? I understand now that NPCs had to have been part of the plan all along because of development time
---
Saves on the ear then.
---
Yeah, its a group called Spank they made the country roads cover. If you go to spotify and type in "fallout 76 ring of fire" it comes up with their cover.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm not keto nor a doctor but I sincerely get the feeling they are trading one set of digestive diseases for another unless they are largely getting most of their protein from plants.  If you think eating a ton of bacon, sausages and cold cuts every day is healthy there are a ton of doctors would would like to have a word with you.
---
Oh, so nothing new. Just another PUBG/ Fortnite/Apex clone with the Fallout name attached to it... Gotcha!
---
Is wanting a pvp mode the same as wanting a BR mode? I think not. I love pvp, but cant stand BR.
---
Also who is "we"? Do you have a turd in your pocket? I've been a member of reddit for 10 years and have subbed to the main Fallout subs for years. Not sure I can recall a huge calling by the community for a BR mode in any Fallout game.
---
Thank you for the info, been looking around everywhere for someone saying around which time it would be :)
---
Finally some npcs... The game won't be so empty and dead anymore!
---
It's still early morning for the time zone they usually base their updates around. Should be up in a few hours at this point
---
That‚Äôs what I said!  Creepy as all hell!!
---
The free trial hasn‚Äôt started yet, same as the nuclear winter early access thing
---
I had a casting call this past weekend...we have a team of 12 people coming on board. I even found our Chad...he's perfect. lol Professional actor...but his bro sounding voice makes you want to murder him.
---
To be fair there's a lot of precedence in MMO-adjacent games of allowing partial or full respecs after major updates change a lot of the game and fundamentally alter that value of your prior investment. Makes a lot of sense to allow it for something likely to be majorly fundamental to the game like that. It'd be a major influence in me coming back, tbh. I don't want to have to grind for a few days or more to accommodate them finally fixing the game.
---
i‚Äôve been waiting for some real good raider content for ages, hope this really gives raiders as a faction some more attention if it actually is what it looks like
---
Yup yup! Looks like it is.
---
I've only done that when I've been low on caps and seen something I really want like if you had a gun for 4500 and I only had 4000, i would message you at least to try strike a deal at least.
---
OMG.....I don't know what to say. My level of excitement has risen dramatically.
---
Oh...... duppers gonna be sad.....
---
Well, it's a possibility; F76 is a treasure trove of unexpected bugs.  
---
I'm gonna personally start a brand new character, like I planned for survival. There might be also some interesting new meta in few weeks - maybe high END kits, naked berserkers or smth similarly bizarre...
---
Ah alright, can you say when it starts? was watching last night in UK was like 3am so was tired, missed a few details.
---
Also I don't want to put the link here. If I do more than once for every 10 things I post it gets flagged by the reddit police.
---
nice job. wait until you've killed the franchise to release the game you were supposed to make originally. smart
---
I take it melee users are still screwed? Hmm, gonna find out soon enough when I try it in NW.
---
Probably shouldn't judge till you play yourself.  Afterall, if an idiot goes in and gets stomped in seconds they can use that as proof it's bad; sort of like all those idiots that played until they got to Flatwoods then quit and complained there wasn't anything to do in the game, thus the game is bad.
---
There are still post every now and then about how someone finally caves and checks the game out, despite everything they've seen from YouTube or all the articles they've read, and they enjoy the game.
---
NP oh I also forgot to mention that early on at least you might want to turn on pacifist mode.  It‚Äôs under settings&gt;gameplay.  It means you can‚Äôt accidentally engage in pvp if you unintentionally shoot someone.
---
That wiki link is fanfiction
---
It's not certain, that's just the time they usually do updates and when daily events refresh. It could be different, none of us really know
---
looking forward to episode 3 onwards :)  
---
Do you plan on making each episode a little longer or keep them short?
---
I don‚Äôt mean to sound like a dick so please forgive me if I am, but it‚Äôs ‚Äúsneak peek‚Äù. This is a very common error.
---
A ‚Äúpeak‚Äù is the tip of something like the peak of a mountain. A ‚Äúpeek‚Äù is a quick look at something.

I truly believe we have been sold a bill of lies in our society.  The idea that 70% of our food should be sugar is insane and its proven now to have been funded by sugar industry (our food pyrsmid).  My wife is type 1 diabetic when she was pregnant that told her to eat 75% carbs..she is diabetic! Then they she began to retain fluid and swell so we cut out the snacks and her numbers got better she felt better and the fucking doctors told her it's dangerous to not eat that many carbs so EST the snacks again just double the insulin.  They are insane.  Fat is not the enemy in any way.  BUT!!.  Keto is not the savior of the human race either and to act like it and then block anyone with questions puts you in the same camp as scientology
---
Hell yeah. I really thought ever upwards would give us one. I've played too many games with one, far cry, horizon zero dawn, RDR2, that it became a must for me. Sucks that I'll have to wait til fall. Or will I?
---
I also want to know.
---
A "decent" weapon depends on several things. 
---
I think your build is going to dictate what are the best general purpose and backup weapons, seconded by the enemy type, as different weapons are more effective on different enemies.
---
Whats your build?
---
Or
---
AS suggested by another post, do a couple WS runs to gather new toys, try them out, or scrip them, then visit the purveyor and see what happens.
---
Again though, this is just punishing people like me who have a lot of trouble with aiming properly.
---
No matter how much I play, I can never get good at aiming. It's just a massive problem for me. I'd prefer a level playing field rather than people like me getting left behind.
---
I expect we'll get one this Thursday
---
Well the community is anything but toxic sure you will meet a few kids that think they are cool for picking on lower level players but if you are lost in the game just ask for help and people will help trust me almost everyone in the game is amazing. If u need something in the game just ask someone for help and you will get it it just takes talking to the people which is awkward for some but it all ok
---
Im just going to eat some buffs...
---
Hey. Free week. Get it on all of them and see which one is best.
---
Hey man it‚Äôs all good, I didn‚Äôt know there was a difference in the spelling so that‚Äôs on me. If I did irritate you then I apologize for that.
---
Updates are usually around 2-4pm UK time, so I'd guess around then.
---
Pc the fps on consoles ‚Äúsuck‚Äù
---
Pretty sure T45 was prewar, but that‚Äôs not in the lore so we can overlook that, Raider armor also isn‚Äôt, T60 was in Fallout 4 but we don‚Äôt talk about Fallout 4, and those ads for Excavator are just some overstressed coal miner‚Äôs scribbling.
---
^^^/s
---
So basically, you don't like random people, regardless of the game.
---
I don't think they've posted anything official yet, but iirc they usually do updates in the next couple hours of the morning
---
I'de be excited, but you know every 2nd person will be wearing one right?
---
:)
---
Man, why are you so mad?! 
---
This is nothing like PUBG/ Fortnite or Apex. 
---
Yes this BR is the PvP me and other members of the community have been looking for?
---
&gt; A ‚Äúpeak‚Äù is the tip of something like the peak of a mountain. A ‚Äúpeek‚Äù is a quick look at something.
---
You're not being a dick, though I admit it was something like 3:30 - 4am this morning for me and I was half asleep while replying.
---
Oof couldn't be more right
---
Anthem actually got about 2 minutes between FIFA and Madden I think? That basically said they had just released a patch I think? I dunno, but the guy doing the announcement want almost laughing about it and I think he was the project head or something.
---
I don't think they are going to expand the map, but they will surely change locations (as we already saw in the trailer with the space station).
---
I like to think that it will expand on the overseers mission, as currently there is no way of completing it. I would say it'll have you do everything you've done this far. Then when you finally reach the "end" of the main quest, it'll have you keep going on the new quest line.
---
PLASMA CASTER
---
BOW AND ARROW
---
AND LASER MUSKET ARE GOING TO BE ADDED!!!
---
This is all based on the promotional art
---
You‚Äôre saying some things that aren‚Äôt true man. The game already has a solid foundation with hundreds of hours of existing content. I highly recommend you hop in during the free week, ignore the BR and just play Adventure mode. You‚Äôll have plenty of content to keep you busy until Wastelanders comes out as dedicated PvE content.
---
350+ hrs in, I'm in Dallas (Plano) Bethesda - hit me up!
---
I do believe I owe you an apology.
---
You were right. I also shouldn't have been so abrasive with my comments, and regret that.
---
I apologize.
---
Yeah, Im perfectly fine. Just wonder why people are flipping out and acting like NPC's are something new to 76.
---
Its like a forest that has a healthy population of Timberwolves, but no Gray wolves... Then the forest service decides to introduce Gray wolves to the forest and everyone is freaking out about wolves getting introduced to the forest.
---
You: "Did you hear... They are finally adding wolves to the forest!"
---
Me: "you do realize Timberwolves are wolves as well"
---
You: "everyone knows that"
---
Me: SMH
---
I was under the impression we atleast keep all our special points where we have them. And it would suck to unlock all that special skins, clothing and trophies on a character that wasnt you long time main guy. I might just tryn make as much room in my stash to put all my weapons n armor in it before i enter. Lol strip down and then hop in üòÇ
---
Well it's now the 11th here and it's not live, surely a company as big as Bethesda could get the particulars right world wide.
---
I guess once Todd finishes up partying and crawls into work he'll push the button.
---
Holy Atoms imagine getting this hot and bothered by a game mode.
---
Depends on how you want to play PVP.
---
if you just play the normal game inside survival, it is pretty fun to have the added pressure of possibly being hunted. HOWEVER, if you are wanting to actually shoot other vault dwellers it becomes difficult unless you have god tier weapons and armor.  
---
Explosive Gattling Plasma is the king of all weapons in PVP
---
Assassin Sentinel or Assassin Cavalier is the king of all armor
---
Idk why but this made me laugh
---
I don't really care if I have to play it or not, I care that the devs are chasing fads to attract a different audience while not addressing any of the issues I want to see fixed.
---
Normally updates come out 10-11 A.M. EST.
---
I'm pretty excited to be able to PvP and not have to kill them 20 times in order to win because they keep respawning
---
You do realize that there is a huge combat rework coming out with the next update right ? Lmao
---
From my experience they usually do downtime/updates around 10:30-11:00pm EST
---
all I want is my own personal dogmeat.
---
I think you may have a misunderstanding of how Pacifist mode works and the changes to PvP that were made, possibly because when the Bethesda community folks on this subreddit first mentioned the coming changes they phrased it as your C.A.M.P. not being able to be damaged when using Pacifist mod.
---
However, when the changes actually came in slap damage AND C.A.M.P. damage was just completely removed rather than requiring Pacifist mode active. At this point all Pacifist mode does is make it so you can't accidentally initiate PvP. And this comes with the risk that if you get flagged for PvP somehow, you won't be able to fight back. This can happen if you own a workshop and someone contests it while you are in the workshop build area or you're on a team and one of your teammates initiates PvP with someone.
---
The slap damage changes came in Patch 7.5, the C.A.M.P. damage changes came in Patch 9.

---
ME TOO!
---
Surprised me as well when I started a month ago.  Yeah just play the game and youll get a ton after getting to 'max level' 50.  As long as you save them.
---
I'm about to try the game in survival mode and I just hope all the people who exploited the game in it's early days with item duping etc will just fck off and not ruin the experience for the rest of us. Really baffled why Bethesda didn't force new characters on Survival mode. It would get rid of all duped stuff.
---
Yeah, I could see where that could become a problem. You get yourself super tanky, then become a walking piece of mesh if a deathclaw looks at you sideways while you're hunting for ballistic fiber scrap, lmao.
---
It may be a different mode or locked behind progress. Not sure how it would work with the story if it isn't.
---
I will teach them that Rad Worms are the pathway to Atom's Enlightenment, so embrace the bloated glowing ones!
---
I just want them to replace the scorched as the default roaming enemy and I'd be over the moon
---
*Mothman
---
No john Denver or Johnny cash makes me a sad panda. John Denver is probably expensive to get rights, but Johnny cash is in every commercial known to man.
---
And I wouldn't want to engage in pop so that'll be one of the first things I do.
---
We found Timmy!
---
Guess I better finish the story then
---
I was just going to say if they start bothering me I'd drop them some nukashine and tell them about the buff. 
---
Not about the black out. Lol
---
I do understand where you‚Äôre coming from and I feel for you but there does need to be a level of skill and not auto aim. It‚Äôs like saying for example,  that you sign up for a game of baseball, and you ask to get underhanded throw because you are not good enough at hitting to hit the same speed as the other players. You can‚Äôt play a skill based game mode and complain of lack of skill and demand what is pretty much aimbot. Because of your struggles with aiming on m&amp;k, do you think hooking up a controller would help you aim better? It may give u better control
---
It's great on so many levels... It be an amazing single player/Co op, story based 20 hour game. If that was what was, then it be one of the best experiences I've had as while going through the campaign I thoroughly enjoyed it.
---
There just wasn't a reason to Keri playing after that. I have about 100 hours in the fans from replaying the story with friends to catch them up, some freeplay and strongholds. It kept me going based on nothing but the poor joy of the game for a while.
---
For a game that's suppose to be a "live service", it fails miserably though.
---
Why would we expect a full price triple AAA game made by a multi million dollar company to be bug free? Absolutely ridiculous.
---
I just got a Quad Gauss with 25% faster fire rate I am glad after reading this I did not turn it in for scrip.
---
I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs multiples of 4
---
Most likely in a few hours from now, at the usual time when patches are released.
---
They'll all be around 20 to 30 minutes. I'm trying to keep them focused as opposed to just adding in filler. There are 2 2-part summer specials we're working on that will be longer.
---
There‚Äôs 2 modes now now. Adventure and survival.  Survival is much more PvP
---
bruh just push the x button once problem solved. it even loads your secondary weapon but i don‚Äôt see you crying about that
---
Maybe for the winter update... Shame the wasted that title though.
---
They said it's a team based gamemode instead of a massive free-for-all?
---
In that case I can either everyone on the winning team getting the same rewards or perhaps the winning team will be forced into one final deathmatch against each other to get the title.
---
About time! HYPPPPEEEEEEEE
---
They are more stable than they were.. but wouldn't call them completely "stable" as of yet.
---
Thanks for understanding. It's because sometimes people really take it the wrong way when you try and correct some rather common spelling mistakes. :)
---
Even that doesn't make sense. Don't KILL them and take their stuff...RAID them, rough them up, take their stuff then go elsewhere while they build up again and you can come back again another time.
---
inverse sarcasm:
---
Anthem says "hello"
---
If I was a brand new player coming into an unpopular game to try it out, I definitely wouldn't want a bunch of level 100+ people swarming me as soon as I leave the vault and pestering me as I'm trying to figure out the first quests.
---
No worries.
---
The roadmap talks about taking cosmetics back with you
---
I'm frankly surprised that the people who make games about psychological torture chamber vaults would pull such a stunt.
---
I have had moments were higher level players could have killed me but instead had waved or even helped me, so ues we need to keep showing Todd we are a great community and that other and to show that faith in humanity hasn't been misplaced.
---
I think you've got time to bang out a few levels and raise your charisma.
---
I don't really see it being too much different from how the game is now, with perhaps a little Fallout 4 Nuka World thrown in.
---
Some NPCs will appear. Some of those NPCs will be un-harmable, like core story NPCs in Fallout 4. Some will be killable, like Settlers or non-essential NPCs.
---
I'm guessing there will be two factions in this update. Raiders in the North and Settlers in the Forest (or somewhere similar.) The factions will have a couple of 'theme park' locations, like the crashed space station which will have a reasonably high population of non-killable NPCs, akin to Diamond City or Megaton.
---
Other locations in Appalachia will suddenly populate with human NPCs. Think about places you've been on the map: aren't there a lot of raider style encampments, farms, houses and areas that look like they **just** fell vacant, not years but hours ago? I believe those will be the places that the new human NPCs spawn in, in Settler or Raider flavours.
---
The additional game loop for this update will be "Hey NPC, I'm here to help you gather crops/kill a nearby monster/build you a toilet." in a similar fashion to Fallout 4 Settlement quests or "Hey NPC, get the fuck of of this farm or I'll kill you. Also, I'm going to kill you anyway." not unlike Nuka World raider quests.
---
These are all systems and mechanics that were in use in Fallout 4 and since Fallout 76 is effectively Fallout 4 with some additional bells, whistles and giant bats, I feel strongly that this is pretty much how things will go.
---
Normally updates come out 10-11 a.m. EST
---
Ya your right. I too am hopeful for these updates, but you can NEVER put your faith in a trailer. Otherwise WoW would of been a properly animated high octane action game, rather than  a colorful point n click.
---
It is rad, I had the opportunity to play it for almost 2 hours back in April and was pleasantly surprised.  I HATE Fortnite but this was different, not as fast paced yet still very tense.  There is no speed building walls to get away from the enemy, it's fight or die.
---
Now to see which way the big name youtubers take it.
---
In fallout 76 there is Pking but you have to be in survival mode because they have two modes adventure mode and survival mode in adventure mode u can kill people but u can get in alot of trouble (not banned or reported) you will get a bounty over ur head if u kill someone or if u attack their base. In survival mode u can kill other players all u want without restriction.
---
First I'm not mad... Just trying to get something straight and that is your statement that seems to speak for the entire community about the desire for a BR mode in 76.
---
I'd be willing to bet that the majority of Fallout players dont really care about BR, yet you speak as if your desires for BR represent the Fallout community as a whole... Something I disputed because I have not seen evidence to support your stance.
---
Also, nothing like Pubg/Fortnite/Apex? Hmmm...I think you might want to reasses that stance. If you think that BGS didn't use Pubg/Fortnite/Apex as a model, a reference or inspiration for the Fallout BR, then you are much more naive than you appear.
---
You‚Äôre replies on this post are absolutely ridiculous and I feel bad for how sad you must be in real life.
---
https://fallout-detroit.fandom.com/wiki/Vault_79
---
Think link will explain vault 79 that is opening up in fall.
---
or just dont harass them at all. Nobody wants max level players swarming them in the starter area of a game.
---
But we can't do that without lowering points from other specials. I think I prefer some of the other suggestions of using chems instead
---
Can't wait to get that coat on my character (:
---
I can‚Äôt wait to get absolutely bent over by it
---
There‚Äôs a TON of ppl on consoles and the game is optimized better. Pc crashes like no one‚Äôs business, not Xbox
---
How about a gigantic compound of raiders high on radiation, all armed with plasma guns? We need more plasma gun drops.
---
Consoles because lol @ pc crashing constantly
---
Ok i finnaly made some screens and check what i get after all runs.
---
The Leader has over 600 events done - he was runing with both team- he was server hoping and looking for uranium fever event, when its found the rest four account join to his server and fasttravel to his camp.
---
team 1: all accounts had 1st and 2nd tier learned
---
On all 5 accounts i found protective lining, on 4 of them also shielded, on 2 of them got also treated and resistant linings (they were both under lvl 20 when started so mabe that was the case),. 1 account which dont get shielded lining , had protective learned, all 4 account which found shielded - doesn't have protective learned...
---
team 2: nothieng learned even 1st and 2nd tier
---
one account get protective and shielded...
---
here are screens with all plans they get :
---

---
I suppose it's gonna be kill-with-what-you-find... Without VATS counter those melee users can actually have an advantage, when running fast and zig-zaggy... Though I would still trust my aim more then a random hammer. We'll see.
---
What it sounds like to me. Smash bros lost nothing with the transition to online. All of its offline experience is still there, and the online is just an addition.
---
Well, World of Warcraft uses what they call "phasing" technology.
---
Let's say you arrive in a new area to find a town that was just attacked.  The town is in ruins, on fire and with wounded people everywhere.  Quests are to sort out the fire, drive off the invaders and apply first aid.  You are joined by other players who are also at that point in the quest line.  Players in other phases are invisible/noninterractable.
---
When finished, the phase advances and you find the town in a better state: civilians are walking about, a camp has sprung up for temporary housing, reception of supplies, etc. and there are more quests.  Surrounded by players who are at this step in the chain.  Players in other phases are invisible/noninterractable.
---
Do those quests (deliver supplies, , etc.) and you jump forward to another phase, where the town is partially rebuilt, etc.
---
They do this for hundreds (if not thousands) of quests/world spaces, with the result being that the world very noticeably changes (environment, npcs, etc.) as you pursue the quest/story lines.
---
We know that, at least in their single player titles, that items/areas/npcs CAN be present or absent depending on quests/items, so theoretically it could be done.
---
I expect that actually implementing it would be a daunting task.
---
Mmhm the smell of burning karma *pulls up chair takes out popcorn
---
I like to do solo play and avoid all players. So i dont use player vending, i try to earn what i got
---
I love vats, I'm heavily reliant on it in adventure mode. But I totally agree it has no place in pvp.
---
Maybe, but do the shoulders and chest even match up with hellfire? They look different to me
---
*Woobie
---
For the people that like PvP this is going to be great.  I'm not that excited, but I suck at PvP. 
---
My hope that Todd was going to reveal Contraptions Workshop for 76 was unfounded.
---
excited, episode 1 was great and episode 2 was too....will give my star reviews on Itunes once I have listened to a few more episodes.
---
Keep up the good work though :)
---

Col Gutsy would be proud....

You can earn thousands of atoms by just playing the game. The game has challenges which work like achievements, like kill certain number of a type of enemies, craft a certain number of a type of weapons,etc. you‚Äôll earn these by just playing the game. And then there are daily and weekly challenges that renew on a timer, these include some easy challenges like take of picture of something, or craft healing items or alcohol; and some week long challenges like craft 25 kinds of alcohol, kill different types of enemies. You‚Äôll easily earn enough atoms to buy yourself a nice power armor skin or some camp items to decorate your house. Most of my friends have thousands of atoms and none of us have bought any with real money. But some will buy atoms to support the developers to put out free content. It‚Äôs all up to you.
---
Shut my door when you use it if you dont want me to lock it!
---
I‚Äôm not sure... I feel like the Brotherhood and Enclave definitely could come back with human npcs from other areas not Appalachia. I feel like they‚Äôre done with the Responders and Free States stuff but they may completely blindside me. The website says Raiders and new settler factions... so I think maybe this is the new direction they‚Äôre heading with factions.
---
Ok i like this idea the best so far, going down inside a fissure to find the source sounds amazing
---
You want to know if I ever have anything valuable to say? Like in the sub? Check both of the top 2 posts in the past month for this sub my guy.
---
Gaaaary
---
I get what you're saying but using survival score isn't exactly a good argument, for example in CTF game modes you only get points from capturing the flag but it's still 100% a PvP mode even if PvP doesn't contribute to your score. I think it's better to say that Survival is possibly what they intended from the start with the whole "you never know if another player is friendly" and "it adds new tension with every encounter".
---
I'm not a fan of BR, but it works here. We now have a competitive mode where everyone is equal. No assasins sentinel to mask your inability anymore. Now everyone is equal and skill now determines who survives.
---
not much of an answer, but NOT ENOUGH  
---
They are too easy to be killed unfortunately, they need at least a double HP buff
---
&gt;Pc crashes like no one‚Äôs busines 
---
I don't know what you're talking about.  PC's pretty stable for me, but I'm not going to argue that it's more stable than a console.
---
Less then 1 hit from my Bloodied Deathclaw Gauntlet.
---
Where do I download the free trial? It still shows $30 on the xbox store
---
Some kids like to play with poop. I don't judge.

That isn't stopping people on reddit from being disappointed, lol.

You don't smell a hoax or a troll?
---
I usually have one other dude that plays we were thinking on doing the new Nuclear winter you could join if you want!
---
*Mariachi intensifies*
---
Yeah its a game... my god if someone steps into your house lol.
---
you already know.
---
&gt;!I thought Enclave are bots-only!&lt;
---
I guess there will be raiders and settlers as factions you will be able to join. Unsure about Brotherhood of Steel as they are a bit far to reach Appalachia.
---
I sincerely hope not, it looks too significant to just be a skin.
---
A bunch of Detroiters coming to WV to start violence? 
---
That's... a little too true to life recalling my time in Huntington a decade ago.  I'm not sure if it's intentional or not...
---
I will add you now. I won‚Äôt be buying anything today obviously but would be nice to know a trader if I decide to stick around in the game! And to learn how trading works. Thanks!
---
I have a love/hate relationship with it. I hate the ‚ÄòI‚Äôm better than you‚Äô jackasses who probably spent actual money on in game gear and go around ‚Äòhunting‚Äô and doing nothing but racking up player kills.. always check the Player Kills list and see ‚Äòwho killed who‚Äô notifications and avoid those guys.. but I love the tension of actually trying to play the game in Survival mode not knowing if the next person you meet will be friendly or not.. 
---
As an example of an experience I enjoyed: was in Flatwoods just chatting to a level 6 (I‚Äôm 176). Out of nowhere comes some guy (or girl, let‚Äôs not assume) in a clown outfit and oversized head with an all caps name and one-claws us with a Deathclaw or Moleminer claw thing. They didn‚Äôt take any junk, so this was purely an opportunity kill for them. Fair enough.
---
Anyway, this puts them on the list so I respawn and spend the next 30 minutes following them around the Flatwoods / Nuka factory area waiting for my opportunity to strike back. A little stalking, if you like.
---
They finally stop at the farm down the west side and I sneak in as close as I can and do my thing. 
---
Naturally I leave the junk. Revenge was served.
---
I understand what you're saying but that doesn't make sense to me. 
---
There would have to be a reason to dabble in the different modes. Survival had extra xp and the weekly weapons, sounds like NW will have it's benefits that you can bring back to adventure. What could Wastelanders have and for that matter what could adventure offer?
---
I cant wait to hear the excuse of where everyone has been. Like I hope they all dont just show up and act like nothing happened
---
yeah I believe they will steer away from the factions already in game
---
Thankfully most of them are pretty easy to get. I got the action hero (.50 MG, TS/faster fire rate/faster reload) with minimal.time in survival. It was just a crafting/scrapping challenge, so you could gather all the materials in exploration mode and spend 10 minutes crafting in survival.
---
My build? right.. umm
---
Not really sure to be completely honest, i've been experienting with different styles since the release. (can tell you that stealth character is definitely not my build)
---
 https://imgur.com/cs0pPkv 
---
those are my perks anyway, i'm strong and intelligent i suppose, i always liked melee from time to time but dont feel like thats my thing entirely, tesla rifle is pretty fun to use on multiple enemies at the same time. i also have a two shot gatling gun and a gauss rifle
---
I'm hoping they give the other interior areas the airport treatment. The vanilla areas aren't great compared to outside but all the new interiors look awesome. I'd love a new Fort Defiance especially.
---
I'm in the same boat, I guess. I don't have any interest in the Battle Royale genre... which is why I've always liked Fallout games. If I **did** like Battle Royale games, there are a whole freaking cart load of them out there at the moment, on every conceivable platform. I'd just go play those.
---
I don't think there it's wrong to be disappointed... I mean, it's not where you hoped the game was going, right? So of course you'll be a little down that the game you like isn't going somewhere you think you'll enjoy. Are you saying it's a bad thing? That no-one will enjoy it? No, you're just asking if anyone else feels that same. I'm just saying I do feel the same.
---
Hope you can still find some enjoyment in the game though! It still does have its moments, sometimes :)
---
The upside to it is you can dial in your damage vs health and really balance out the risk vs reward.  Do you want to be able to take more blows cause its 6 supermutants or just get the fight over with fast cause bears are a PITA?  And honestly I really do feel kinda like a super hero when I tell my gf: "hang on i, gotta juice up real quick" then jump into a pile of radioactive barrels lol
---
Don‚Äôt take this as being rude, but there‚Äôs just way too much to catch up on. Quest lines, the legendary vendor, player vending, weapon nerds, the camera, pioneer scout stuff, camp budget changes, etc. Your best bet would be to read over all the inside the vault articles from back when you stopped playing. Then if you have questions about an aspect of the changes, we can answer those (like where to find a camera)
---
Fo76 BR sounds stupid.
---
Also what platform
---
I was under the impression it would be a smaller map because of the ring of fire, not to mention you won't get very far in 20 minutes.  I guess we'll find out soon.
---
Same here - it would probably have been a better idea to not put the marketing for this publicly on the site until it was actually working in the atom store.
---
If they didn't want a world wide audience to watch then maybe they shouldn't have broadcast it world wide.
---
&gt; They already changed Morgantown airport
---
What changed about the airport? I'm guessing the fraternities took a bite out of it, but I don't remember what the area looked like before those were added. I figured they just slapped some greek letters on existing building.
---
FO4 had a classic weapon DLC added recently and I knew they were making that for 76
---
Noticed it too. This was the reason i stopped playing at launch. Maybe another hiatus is needed again
---
Haha, oh my god, that's great.
---
im charging really low if i do at all i make it depending on the character level something like 100caps or so will do the job
---
check out my account i guess youll get a pretty good idea of what i am talking about :)
---
I know. Bloodied musket one shots any deathclaw. Was curious knowing, but when the UI for damage being shown will probably help gauage it
---
Asking the real questions I see
---
Yes I am sure Fallout used other battle royale games as references for their mode. That does not mean that they are carbon copies or anything like each other. 
---
Im not speaking for the entire community. Im speaking for the large portion of the community who have been begging for a mode with these aspects for a while
---
Please don't give him credit for this. The Austin studio deserves the praise, not the snake oil salesman
---
I look forward to waving at you from a distance as we pass each other in the wasteland, never to be seen again.
---
Yup...not sure. Couldn't find other sources. Edited this post.
---
Obviously not for your situation, but for others, it depends also on what mods you might have unlocked. I use leather arms because my sniper happened to get lucky and unlock the stabilized mod...that made a huge difference to me so I ended up with so-so vanguard leather arms. 
---
Sometimes it's worth a little less armour if you have a mod that makes a difference to your build or a half-decent legendary trait on something.
---
I don't understand the question?
---
Yasha Im with you. So many people are naive about this.
---
I was looking at the trailer and thinking ‚Äúmy eyes still hurt from the poor framerate‚Äù and ‚Äúthere‚Äôs gonna be so much bluescreening‚Äù.
---
I still randomly blue screen when standing by WS station, so all this great new content seems like it won‚Äôt be executed well.
---
I know on console it is a bit of an issue. My buddy has issues with red/green so really wants the ability to change it.   Let‚Äôs hope that now that the bulk of the production on NW should be wrapped up, they can devote some time to this one.
---
That‚Äôs cool. We need a better messaging system on PS4. I have to actually send a friend request if I want to talk to a shop owner about haggling with a price. Maybe there‚Äôs an easier way I don‚Äôt know about.
---
It was another vault experiment that used the entire region as a "vault". Kappa
---
I'll love the new Waste Virginia... and I hate to admit it... but I'll miss the old emptiness lol That will probably go quickly when I'm balls deep in the new quests.
---
Which, now I'm on that... how will the wasteland vs raiders stuff work? When we help them, do they stay helped? Radiant quests? (I'll enjoy that more than most). If it changes 'settlements' then do they stay with that faction? Just that server? Do we compete with other players (faction vs faction) for that area?
---
Will there be less scorch beasts now we've nuked them? Could BoS come back?
---
Meow
---
Agreed. VATS was does not belong in any kind of PvP in my opinion. Not gonna call it "a proper skill-based game mode" just yet but i can say for sure that it's the best PvP option F76 has to offer.
---
Obligatory thumbs up. This is a must. I'm a traditionalist. I just want my pump shotgun and a chainsaw. No need to mount to my arm all Ash like.
---
Same happened on my servers I‚Äôve been on. Loads of people to greet the new vault dwellers. I‚Äôm gunna make sure I have more crops grown and more purifiers left out for them as my camp is opposite overseers. üòÑ
---
Yeah....not a bloodied fan as it makes things too easy.
---
*sad vault boy face*
---
Pretty content with the weapon set I have now, but on the lookout for something new and different, so I'm with BloatedGlowingOne.
---
WS is my goto for legendaries (and XP).  Easy enough to do - Make a circuit, goto the train station to scrip what I know I don't want/need, run the circuit again, back to the train station, repeat as desired. 
---
Visit the purveyor when my travels take me that far north.
---
No one is forcing you. That's like saying you're forced to become leader of all the factions in Skyrim. Can you? Yes. But it's your decision. If you don't like the PvP modes then don't play them, but don't act like those who enjoy those modes shouldn't be allowed to have rewards to work for within them.
---
Seems like you're not alone in thinking that though, I've seen this sentiment a lot (actually surprised you've been downvoted for it) and I'm guessing it comes from the "collector" type players who feel compelled to collect anything that could be considered unique in game.
---
No one is going to waste money flipping serums to robot vendors. Even selling it for 300, that leaves only 200 profit for me, and the bots pool is now down 500. 
---
Flipping serums gives such a tiny net profit because of the limited cap pool. 
---
Sure some might do it, but honestly, jokes on them, and caps are in your pocket.
---
also waiting, saw people saying it will be up in 1-2 hours
---
Point is if you are in pacifist and not defending a workshop (and you have to be at it now to be considered defending it) or a team that is deciding to war against another, they can‚Äôt do anything (ok so they can kill your camp anima which I do think Bethesda should fix). Yes, there is an exploit to work around but that is why the one guy I team with is like me and we are both pacifist. And as for workshops if they want it, they can have it. I‚Äôm not going to go defend it. And if I was I can turn pacifist off before going there. And if they catch me while they are there I‚Äôm just going to run.
---
Probably at abt 11 EST that‚Äôs usually when Bethesda does everything update wise
---
What's happening to the camps? Haven't had time to watch the stream yet
---
Actually I completed this one, just taking a picture of a flatwoods monster. Wasn‚Äôt in Morgantown and wasn‚Äôt wearing a tinfoil hat, so it‚Äôs bugged anyway. Happen to come across two yesterday in Survival mode running from Top of the World to Sugar Grove
---
no offense, but if you're either not 80 years old, or have at least 2 brain cells, pc gaming is as easy as it gets.
---
Also, the price point thing has been debunked multiple times. If you don't just buy the first thing that comes up you can get a great pc for around console price.
---
maybe they were afraid cnet would go after them for being toxic...
---
Agreed, fantastic group!
---
You can buy it used for like $20...I wouldn't worry too much about selling it.
---
Well technically it's not nuclear _winter_, more like hot burning forest which is exact opposite of what they were wishing.
---
Yeah they just want to date and don't care what happens. 
---
"FO76 sucks and they should fix it, but they never will"
---
Bethesda *starts fixing FO76*
---
"Yeah thats the bare minimum. It should never have released like that in the first place!"
---
I doubt it, this game is online only
---
No, the airport itself. They changed the interiors and added more lore to find.
---
60 horse power
---
I‚Äôm so excited for everyone jumping in!!!
---
No..imma hunt them. The deadliest prey is....noobs
---
Go away Todd.
---
So I just want to clarify, the best information we have is that the free trial will come with their usual update cycle. Which in this case makes it around 2-4pm BST?
---
Probably after an update, and it should start soon
---
It‚Äôs a fully online game so you‚Äôd need gold, yes
---
Near the Overseers camp actually, would have prefered another spot but I havnt explored very far yet, lvl 17 only. But it has wood and a flat surface to plant. Might see to upload some pictures of my farmhouse to r/Fallout76settlements
---
Search 'worth'...
---
That‚Äôs a good point, though I suppose a hot burning Forest could be what makes it a nuclear winter? Haha
---
I‚Äôm wondering if they‚Äôll have different servers as you progress.
---
You leave the vault, and its what you have now with bots and holotapes. Then, when you progress to some point or do a certain quest, you load into the servers where the NPCs are showing up.
---
https://youtu.be/v0XKqiNLlLk
---
Yes, unfortunately it looks like only players who win in the BR will get everything out of the new Vault. 
---
If you aren't good at the PVP/don't do well with the BR mode you won't be able to explore as much of the vault.
---
A bit sad for a lot of PVE players, would be nice if there had been a quest line to get there as well as the BR mode.
---
Built scorched tough.
---
How about you try the free trial week from june 10-17 and answer that question for yourself
---
Only way I found for rifles to be worthwhile without using a whole clip each time.
---
Doubtful. The Appalachia roadmap and various updates have brought several surges of new players, I‚Äôve yet to notice an overall change in the community. I downloaded the game early December and I‚Äôve run into ten amazing people for every jerk, as well as hearing the same from other players.
---
I thought only the meat hook but I‚Äôm unfortunately not online atm to check
---
are you sure thay are your friends? cuz friends don't act like that.
---
They made you pay for an alpha game and this is proof! Already saw some argue this on some forum I‚Äôm on that already had a lot of Bethesda hate before 76 (several were happy Bethesda was finally getting called out on their bugginess cause it pissed them off people dared like the games in spite of the bugginess).
---
Pretty much and that‚Äôs just kinda assuming knowing them it‚Äôll be delayed 2 weeksüòÇ
---
Looks great - this is what I was hoping/assuming they were gearing up for - us Day 1 players were the first ones out of the vault, we go out establish bases, kill some beasts, get a feel for what's happened to the world before people start settling in.
---
That's why the pip-boy never cycled past those two days - we're out there re-establishing the foundations of civilization/community and that takes some time.
---
The settlers?
---
For me, it's worth $60. Most issues people reported back during launch in November had been patched out over the past few months (not all, mind).
---
If you're debating whether to get it on PC or console, then PC is the only option as you can get some handy mods to improve the gameplay for you.
---
I am so impressed by this game. I'm so impressed by how they keep developing it. It's obvious to me they are trying so hard to make everyone happy. But people keep complaining and demanding stuff. Human nature I guess
---
God damn it these misleading advertisements. They could start it 11:59 PM ET on June 10 and say it's available from June 10.
---
And now ill never unsee it.
---
It has been like this for me since launch day.
---
Screw 'em.
---
No its worth more
---
I enjoyed my time with FO76 at launch and I paid full price. I put in 50 hours before I dropped off of it but their conference yesterday has me excited to jump back in. I know they added a lot of content in previous months. I'd say go for it. I compare the cost of games to movies a lot of the time. What do you pay to see a two hour movie these days? Like $12-15. There's plenty of fun to be had for $16 and it's only going to get better.
---
Lmao. No come back and -3 on every reply you have. No one agrees with you my dude. Just stop, you are literally getting mad that someone disagrees with you about an ingame mechanic that has always existed.
---
Been a while since I've been in the airport. I'll have to poke around there to see if I notice anything different.
---
Same thing, I will love the new factions and NPC ("are you from that vault? Can you help us?" I got the chills) but... this is our Appalachia, not theirs...
---
I think that a new raider is being born
---
That‚Äôs definitely the plan. I always get sidetracked in open world games. I‚Äôm pretty sure I have a save in FO4 where I made it to level 35ish just by exploring and not doing a single story quest.
---
I can't even find a way to download it for PS4, do you know when we'll be able to?
---
Now you can just play fallout 76 and then return to fallout 76.
---
Yeah...! The... settlers... *laughs nervously*
---
Watch some YouTube videos
---
Neither are great, Anti-Armor is probably better though
---
"Welcome to Appalachia!!  Let's toast your arrival!  Here...have some of this vintage Nukashine."
---
I'm in the same boat with Xbox, just trying to get some feedback as I'm unsure how long the cdkeys sale is for FO76.
---
AA is good just for that effect alone. Stalkers doesn't buff damage in any way, but has good modifiers if you're stealthy VATS sniper.
---
Quite surprised to see someone wanting to use BPR as they were always overlooked due to reload animations. Even Gauss Rifle seems better in every way.
---
Vault 51 is opening!
---
Thanks. I've been trying to find a use for black powder rifles. But that slow reload time kills me
---
The article specifically says "now", which is why I said "now" and not "week". Typically, "now" means "now".
---
For someone not interested in a back AMD forth you sure do like going back and forth
---
Omg, that made me literally laugh out loud.  Bella Bella Dancerella.  Friggin' LOVE it!
---
Instigating VATS Crit Hunting 50Cal works well.
---
Makes you save the Crits for just such an occasion. It would normally take 3 shots without the VATS Crit Sneak to kill a Deathclaw
---
Thank you for your visit.
---
Awesome feedback, thanks!
---
Since last update i had a lot more stability isues, but original PS4 is just weak shit. You need decent rig for complex games like this.
---
This is really nice to know. Two final questions - 
---
1 - So the in-game store only uses Atoms as a currency? There are no other currencies for special items in the in-game store?
---
2 -  Vendors in the game itself, what currency do they use, is it caps? I assume this is earned/found through missions/in the world? 
---
Thanks!!
---
I just like the aesthetics lol but yeah if I dont 1shot with bpr, I'm screwed
---
Amen. I would‚Äôve been pissed if people kept trying to give me free weapons and armour as a low level. Let them discover the world themselves and, god forbid, struggle a bit for resources. Handing people everything on a plate ruins the best part of the early game.
---
No. You go to adventure to kill people man. There are no consquences and you don't get a bounty for killing them. There is no reward from killing other players in survival despite it being the place for unresteicted PvP.
---
Uuhh, no. Last I checked you have no authority to tell me what to or not to do. So I'm going to continue the way I am. I don't want to play *something else*, I want to play the Fallout 76 we should have gotten instead of this poorly thought out multiplayer cashgrab we actually got.
---
According to other people on this reddit, it should come active at about 11am est
---
Yeah I thought this. Maybe they had to finish the min story and nuke the queen first? Not sure.
---
There are now vending machines at individual player camps. So whatever I have in my inventory that I‚Äôm not using I can place into my vending machine and set a price. Anyone can then travel to my camp which is marked on the map to view my inventory or make a purchase. Items listed in your vending count towards your character stash weight (stored items) not your carry weight (on your person).
---
IMO its worth $26.53...
---
*recalling melted human from the car in Edward Norton*
---
Eesh....
---
The update will probably start in a couple of hours. These big updates usually take 2-3 hours to complete. So later today, your friends should be able to play the game.
---
It‚Äôs a dumb form of elitism and a dose of ‚Äúthings I don‚Äôt like are objectively inferior‚Äù attitude.
---
Is it up yet?
---
You're misunderstanding the supply and demand.
---
Your reasons for serum prices rest on the fact that it vendors for 500. That would make sense, if there were more than 1400 available caps a day.
---
Even a person flipping underpriced serums comes away with a tiny profit and an utterly exhausted cap limit. It's not feasible.
---
The buyer AND the seller shoulder the burden of the 1400 caps a day. Otherwise youd sell every serum to a robot and call it a day. Other people aren't your personal vendor. You're going to have to adjust to the fact that the average player sits on a few hundred to a couple of thousand caps at a time, and price accordingly.
---
L O D S OF H E L T E
---
Wassat spell? LOADSAHEALTHY!
---
(Prob'ly)
---
That‚Äôs not true - i have always wanted fallout to succeed and I like the game as is and I‚Äôve been wanting npcs and I‚Äôm really excited we‚Äôre finally getting them. You can never please everyone however
---
I left the game a few weeks after launch because it just didnt feel right, will be downloading after work today. They really seem to be eager to fix issues and listen to the community on what could make the game more enjoyable and really that's all you can ask for so I I'm gonna give them another shot
---
Thought so..soon as I heard it I was like "that's that dudes voice..."
---
AA is fantastic, and the stalkers is kinda moot with the additional 33% hit rate unless you don't kill the enemy with the first. I run AA on all my weapons aside from one executioners lever action designed to kill bloodied players if I decide to do pvp.
---
Yeah, I got catapulted to my death at a camp above WS Train Station this weekend. . . And you know, I would have been fine with it and even lol'd about it. But I was still going through the moron's machines. So F him. Guess I won't drop the thousands of caps that I had, on his shit. Blocked him by the time I hit the ground. If he'd just have let me finish shopping before knocking me out of the atmosphere, smh. Oh well his loss.
---
No, they're all dead lmao. New raider gangs entirely tho from the looks if things
---
Most of the updates happen from 11am anywhere to 2pm. Just be patient it will come
---
I was someone that bought the collectors edition. Still waiting for the items I rightfully paid for to get sent to me.
---
Gamers forgive and forget far to quickly.
---
You can only get so many a day. Like caps with the other vendors. üòï
---
and so is the start of the mindless hate for the game being online, it's been going a full year and somehow hasn't run out of puff
---
Cool, so perhaps you'll be more willing to listen to somebody who played the game since B.E.T.A, up until the New year's Eve disaster?
---
Bethesda was asked up front if they were going to jump on the Battle Royale bandwagon. It was a big concern for a lot of players (myself included). They said with a straight face, they wouldn't be doing a battle royale. Yet here we are.
---
I patiently waited for 5 years for single player Fortnite (Save the world) to come out of beta. Battle Royale mode came out for that game, and 99% of their focus shifted from their original product to the giant Cash cow that they now have.
---
I'm not a religious man, but I pray with all my heart and soul they do that with this game. This shity, toxic community deserves it.
---
Right, that's how you play, but the changes that were implemented are not specific to Pacifist mode. The statement "you don't even get slap damage now in pacifist" is misleading, and those who aren't aware of the actual changes made reading and taking it as it's written to be correct could be set up to be at a disadvantage when they find themselves flagged for PvP.
---
I'm not saying don't use Pacifist mode, I'm just saying people should be aware of how it actually works so if they are killed they understand how instead of thinking their murderer was cheating somehow. There's been countless posts on this subreddit since release by upset people thinking someone was cheating because they were killed even with Pacifist mode on, not to mention all the misinformation spread around people claiming they were one shot through slap damage, and all of that stemmed from people not properly understanding the PvP mechanics and how Pacifist mode works.
---
true, this game has become way better tho. Battle royale is just dumb tho
---
Lol 'This was my camp, bitch'. Bang bang.
---
Oh no. Somebody will immediately nuke the NPCs the second they come out.
---
I got it for full price, and think it was worth it. Opinions will differ, but yes, it's well worth the price of a pizza lol.
---
Its the same as all the vendors. Has a 20 hour reset timer.
---
There's no concrete time unfortunately but it will most likely be in between 1-3 hours.
---
Great find man! I'd give you a gold if i had one to spare so i guess you'll just have to settle for my measly upvote.
---
Also looking at the nuclear winter the new features icon looks like a Vault boy with a beacon in his hand and a codsworth in the background.
---
But ive been waiting since yesterday. Do they refill after 24h or at the beginning of a day?
---
No what  I was wondering is if like survival you lose stempack,junk and a lot of caps is what read about. So I don't bother to play it even though I would like to give a go.
---
Lol, you do realize the the 76 BR mode will be much MUCH closer to a Pubg/Fortnite/Apex game than a Fallout game right?
---
I know you are speaking for yourself AND others, but I just think you overstate the size of the Fallout community who actually wants a BR mode.
---
You make it sound as if 9 out of every 10 fallout players have been clamoring for a BR mode in 76. All I am saying is, you and few others might want BR mode in 76, but to call that the majority is not true. 
---
Like I said, I bet more of the Fallout community could do without a BR mode in 76 while a small minority like yourself actually wants it. Yet, you try to create a narrative that the BR mode is what the Fallout community wants most... Im just chiming in to put some perspective to the narrative you are trying to create.
---
same here. want to try it out with my buddy who already has the game, waiting on it to go live
---
If you ignore the YEARS they‚Äôre spending on Starfield and ES6. 
---
They‚Äôre allowed to pursue new markets.
---
I hope so. First step, get rid of legendaries.
---
Not sure yet, but a frequent update time for the game tends to be around 10 AM EST, might be worth checking around then.
---
Ok thank you
---
You‚Äôre the one being toxic. I don‚Äôt like what happened with fortnite either and that whole company is a joke getting bullshit praise.
---
A free cash cow. The cow is free
---
"Fallout 76 Going Free to Play as Todd Begs for Forgiveness at E3."
---
"Bethesda Gives Up:  76 Free to Play, Todd Howard Fears for his Job"
---
"Failure of 76 Pushes Back Development of Elder Scrolls 6."
---
This was a great read, glad you got the opportunity to experience it.
---
There is a reason other games that have a cheating problem don't give everyone an aimbot to give a level playing field. This is a skill based gamemode, where you need skill, if you don't have that, than it isn't a gamemode for you.
---
I would, but if those new rewards are anything decent for adventure then I might get forced into it... Especially if that Hellfire is a reward, doesn't make sense to be in the timeline but still..
---
This was only thing that i was missing from world of warcraft, well if they do something as molten core or naxx, i would be even happier, but factions are egouth for start (lol start year after game release)
---
Upvote for including Talos
---
From what I've read, it's around 20 hours since you're first transaction.
---
That's it
---
No, thank you. It was amusing.
---
Ok that makes sense
---
‚ÄùMajority of gamers dislike a dying game i like reee‚Äù
---
You can play it for free this week I believe! Good chance to see the progress that‚Äôs happened so far
---
well you also unlocks new areas in vault51 ranking up as overseer, so you can learn more about its story and things like that
---
That would limit its appeal and market, but you should rally people to push it as a new mode they can add. I‚Äòd give it a whirl.
---
But it's been the 10th for 6 hours where I live. GIVE ME MY FREE GAME! /s
---
No I'm with you, they should do a better job at patching bugs,testing, and bringing new content out.
---
I wouldn't Mind a week or too off with no new content but just bug fixes. Still crazy as fuck that I can do something as simple as using melee vats at flying enemies not to mention all the things you said.
---
I played from the start, the issues were over hyped imo, as most problems didn‚Äôt affect me as a casual gamer but I‚Äôm sure it was annoying for some more devout fans. Either way I find the game very enjoyable with hundreds of hours of gameplay, and with the planned dlc‚Äôs it looks as though I will continue to play it to the end of the year. So yeah I‚Äôd recommend it üëç
---
If I see you in the wastes I'll be sure to drop you a perfectly safe nukashine so we can drink together ;)
---
If you like the guess stick with it...max out the rest of rifle man and add tank killer...if you really want to do damage you have to focus a little more and use less qol or situational cards like lock picking hacking exterminator. Nothing wrong with have points all spread out but it comes at a bit of a cost.
---
Ok, so you are saying that in pacifist mode you now get full damage? Because all I‚Äôm saying is in general, except for some exceptions, you don‚Äôt get damaged in pacifist mode if some one comes up and tries to shoot you. Which doesn‚Äôt work if you are not in pacifist mode (I had some one kill me and I was not in it. Had forgotten til he killed me and then checked and wasn‚Äôt in it).
---
What do you mean you take workshops? I‚Äôm curious about the settlement building part of this game. Are your things stealable or able to be destroyed?
---
That was a decoy.. I left it there to confuse the people I didnt like from Vault 76.
---
Very exciting. I fell off about 2 months after launch but I'm looking forward to get lost all over again.
---
And ironically, surprised Pikachu was the last thing his victims ever saw...
---
i already helped 3 new people, gave each of them 10 stimpaks and 100 .38 ammo, just enough to get them started. but not holding their hand
---
Other stuff tends to kick off around 10AM EDT, IIRC. That'd be my guess.
---
Let me help you out here. Avoid this game at all costs until they release modding support. Even then, proceed with caution. Lest we forget what day did with the creation club.
---
One other helpful tip: this subreddit is full of fallout 76 cultists, it's impossible to get through to them. If you are interested in making the mistake of buying the game like I did, there's another subreddit called "fallout filthy casuals". They enjoy the game, just without the ball gargling of everything FO76 this subreddit is guilty of.
---
Might be able to get productive critique there.
---
This subreddit is where critics go to get their karma murdered.
---
It sounds like only 10 of them will not be able to go between modes, so I think this is a valid concern.
---
&gt; Nuclear Winter has a grand total of 73 Perk cards for you to unlock and equip; ten of these cards are for this mode only and cannot be carried over to Adventure or Survival Mode.
---
Seems like it's not out yet
---
Only designated workshop areas. Not your personal camp
---
Awesome thanks!
---
As raider i should go on survival server, sit at Vault 76 and loot stimpaks from everyone who gets out, but i will have more work on new mode. Newbies are safe.
---
I still have yet to get that badge. Ive messaged people and everything.
---
I think survival should turn off legendary effects. People want a survival mode and they also want to be god tier. It ain‚Äôt survival if you‚Äôre in some god tier like loadout.
---
"Discovered: Cranberry Bog" \*Screeching Noises Intensifies\*   
---
Interesting first play through...
---
Thanks! I had a free pizza from dominos yesterday and still managed paying $12... lol.
---
I have a TSE Black Powder Rifle with 15% faster reload time. I think the two shot effect is the only reason it‚Äôs worth using. 
---
Also have a TSE Dragon but only a 2* so it takes forever to reload but using it in tandem w/ the TSE BPR lets me kill pretty much anything in Appalachia.
---
I would go with PS4 rather than PC due to the bigger player base, less issues and no hackers.
---
You've a PC and an XBox One and you're prevaricating over a measly 16 dollars ?
---
Also in the same boat as this guy, just wanna test it out. Any tips for new players?
---
That's one of my suggestions as well!
---
&gt; Ok, so you are saying that in pacifist mode you now get full damage?
---
No, that is not what I said at all. I'm saying your original statement "you don't even get slap damage now in pacifist" is misleading because it implies you have to have pacifist mode on to not get slap damage. Slap damage was completely removed, regardless of whether you are using Pacifist mode at all.
---
Nawww I had probably several thousand. Maybe like 3-4 or so
---
You know what bud... comment again, you can have the last word. Not like your reply will be any type of rebuttal that can help you recover from how ridiculous you look.
---
Now I'm worried we haven't had NPC's in so long the game itself changes for the worse. 
---
We'll see soon enough. 
---
Wish Wastelanders arrived before nuclear winter though.
---
The few times I was in surivival was to get the legendary weapon for the challenges
---
Here's a link for a 2 week Gold trial for about 6 bucks. 
---
https://www.g2a.com/en-us/xbox-live-gold-trial-code-xbox-live-14-days-global-i10000005045007
---
My issue is this. We have this broken ass game that we love and instead of using resources to fix current issues theyre creating a new mode based on whats 'so hawt right now' which will create even more bugs and issues. 
---
Also when modes like these get popular devs tend to neglect the base game. BLOPs 4 comes to mind with this. Reg MP gets shit on while the majority of the content is for the BR mode
---
If contradiction had a human counter part, you are it. Shut up whiney.
---
Bloodied melee is the meta right now. It's because by stacking a bloodied weapon (around 90-100% damage boost at very low health), adrenal reaction (something like 60% damage boost at low health), and nerd rage (20% damage boost at low health), you reach ridiculous numbers. Low health also lets you use unyielding armor, which grants you +3 to each special at that health range. +15 strength makes a massive difference for melee characters, and melee is already rather overpowered in the game to begin with
---
Then don't play it
---
Too much people are doing suggestions about this game, so we will have part of everything. I am more sad, that there will be NPC's than that we will have battle royal mode, that we will be forced to play.
---
Open fking vaults, i want raid! :D
---
OK thanks much!
---
I love you. Super job. Will you marry me ?
---
;)
---
Don't plan on it
---
Very disappointed with most of the news. It stopped being fallout and became a mix of far inferior titles unfortunately. This has made me sad.
---
I'm hoping you don't necessarily need to win, maybe the longer you live, the more exp you get to rank up.
---
I'd say yes but that's my personal opinion! You should give the free trial a go and if you like it then it's absolutely up to you!
---
This post sounds like a distillation of the r/shittymoviedetails sub.
---
Executioners....nice idea :P
---
As long as any of the actual quest content didn't change, that's fine by me.
---
Hunt: Showdown has enemy AI along with human players in their quickplay BR mode. Everybody sleeps on it still though.
---
Firstly. That game got new content. So you agree that game‚Äôs fixing bugs with no new content isn‚Äôt something that happens. That said...
---
Secondly. Fallout 76 isn‚Äôt bf5 or call of duty or assassins creed or any typical release where we‚Äôll see a sequel in a few years. There is a studio working solely on updating this game with bug fixes and new improvements and content. It is not a product release so much as a service release. They will go for years on just this game. Comparing to anything that isn‚Äôt of that same vein is meaningless as the work is very different. Compare this to wow or eso. Those are much more similar than bf5. I‚Äôm not even sure what you were trying really argue there. Same concept with them they had a shitty release and they‚Äôre working to correct it. Improvements, bug fixes, and new content. Again, however, that game has a smaller group working to sustain that game while the bulk of work is put into new projects. That is not the case with 76 and support for it won‚Äôt stop after nuclear winter (obviously)
---
Yeah, understandable. It can be fun for a while, but in the end the PvP is a mess right now.
---
OK thanks.
---
The Atomic Shop is separate from the in-game shops. All in game shops use caps except one who exchanges legendary weapons and armor with scrips. You can sell loot you get from the enemies you kill or items you find in the world to in game robot vendors for max of 1,400 caps per day. You can earn more caps by looting enemies like super mutants who drop caps, and by setting up vending machines to sell your extra loot to other players. You get scrips from legendary items you earn in the game and don‚Äôt want. You can turn these items in for up to 150 scrips per day. When you have enough scrips, you can go to the Purveyor to get a legendary item.
---
The Atomic Shop offers extra outfits, emos, furniture and power armor paints. Nothing essential but lots of ‚Äúshinies‚Äù you might want. There‚Äôre also sales for these as well.
---
By 11am the updates should be start.. install time and etc.. prob wont be able to play till 2ish.. before ya get out the vault anyways
---
You've jumped in on multiple of his conversations in this thread shitting all over him/her.
---
They didn't even have half the information I/we do and they could sniff the bulshit from a mile away. What's your excuse?
---
Oh I never fought other players, I avoided them like the plague, I was in constant dark souls styled stress whenever I was in survival, all for the damn weapons XD
---
Seems more like bethesda was not ready to start update. So they are late.
---
I wonder if you'll ever learn how to spell killable
---
I just did Surface to Air - killed 4 Scorchbeasts, collected the giblets grabbed some Cranberries and voila!
---
I just posted that it's live on PS4
---
My only real issue is will you need to win to unlock new stuff? Or can I finish mid table multiple times? I like the idea of new camp stuff, but Im terribad at BR games so will *never* get 1st
---
If I can finish mid table 10x to unlock something I'll probably play it. If I have to finish 1st to get anything I probably wont ever bother.
---
FEV-sus christ!
---
Also the other ea br is just apex right? Which is... free... and features purely cosmetic purchases to sustain the game that is... free...
---
If you do enough searching... you never know...lol
---
That is Awesome!!!!
---
What did they say on character specialization? That's the biggest thing that's driven me away from this game, just the total lack of meaningful customization into an actual role that goes beyond just having high DR and dealing damage in some way.
---
It's dangerous to go in groups.  It's just dangerous.
---
I saw that and I'm like, "fuck, now I need a new character"
---
I think he means couch multiplayer when he says split screen. 
---
Smash Bros is unplayable online for me because the switch has a garbage antenna, but that's not the game's fault.
---
Didn't see anything about them adding this gun to that dlc though.
---
I'm at work so I can't do much research. I'm just confirming the battle royal comes out today, but the NPCs and rest of it comes out this fall?
---
It‚Äôs half off on Xbox too
---
Playing on a ps4 slim, and the game crashed once in 3 days, and I play a lot. Almost 6-8 hours a day. 
---
So maybe you should get a better rig.
---
The can sniff the bullshit? He‚Äôs said multiple things that were just flat out false. Show me the lootboxes...
---
I have a the 1tb PS4 Slim, I don‚Äôt know maybe you‚Äôre right?
---
Still shouldn‚Äôt be a problem. This isn‚Äôt on me, it‚Äôs on bethesda.
---
The consumer is always right, provided they follow the instructions.
---
Bethesda released the game on PS4. They should have optimized it well enough to run properly.
---
It‚Äôs laughable how bad the game runs. The content of FO76 is decent enough, wouldn‚Äôt call it a bad game because of the content.
---
Shuweet whats your psn ill be on shortly
---
Hahaha I know the feeling!
---
Hmm, maybe I don't really get the term RPG but I consider it to be one. We have character progression, we play a role of vault dwellers who are rebuilding Appalachia. Your actions don't have an actual impact on the story like in other games, but why do we call MMORPGs this way since they also don't have a main progressing story?
---
We are playing a role in FO76.
---
Guys I‚Äôm looking for my robot that automatically says Reddit responses, has anyone seen him? I lost him last night during E3 and I think he might have wandered here.
---
I've read they're non transferable, at least until you pick one up from the tourist. Thank you though!
---
The price for a cd key dropped at least to 7 euros, but has been steadily increasing over the past months of content. That being said, you should buy it now before it goes past 29,99 dollars.
---
Shhhh!!!!!!
---
I think You build is balanced with a tendency toward heavy weapons.  (Bandoleer and bear arms)
---
You've got a number of points allocated for occasional use (hard bargain, ammosmith, hacking, all the repair perks)
---
If you are in PA, goatlegs is also only occasionally useful - for example, in PA, without goatlegs, you can pick you way down most seemingly sheer cliffs, (like the area around devils backbone) without damage - yes, I know this from experience.
---
and
---
have a wasted (unused)  point in luck.
---
Perhaps put bloody mess 1 in that unused luck slot.
---
take out fixit good, weapons artisan and armorer, and put something else in there. Stabilized will help your heavy weapons. 
---
Swap out only when you are fixing stuff.  
---
Ditto hard bargain.  LoneWanderer if you are usually solo.  Tenderizer for a little damage bonus.
---
Happy camper is also situational, so that can be swapped for something else as well.
---
I haven't needed to hack terminals in some time - but I do pick a lot of locks.
---
In 6 months/100 levels, I've only been in one place where I almost drown, so aquaboy may also be overkill.
---
As long as the likely OP gear isn't spawned in the exact same spot each round I'm ok with it.  That way it doesn't turn into a mad-dash to the 50 cal and marine armor spawn every time.
---
They are powered vending machines. You can‚Äôt items that are in your stash in them and choose the value in caps you would like to charge. When a purchase happens you receive 90% of the caps, with the other 10% being a ‚Äútax‚Äù that Bethesda takes.
---
That said, you will see a wide variety of behaviors in the vending machines. Some people overprice everything (and complain when nothing sells!). 
---
I personally put a lower price to move some volume on junk, ammo, and plans.
---
Starting plans that are typically only needed by newbies I‚Äôll put in for free.
---
It‚Äôs a great system imo, I traded a piece of gear and 20k caps for a weapon, and in 2 hours sold 7k caps in junk through my vending.
---
One last thing, many people are more reasonable if you talk to them. I found a machete I wanted to buy that was listed at 5k caps, which felt way overpriced. I fast travelled to the owner and chatted with her, learned she simply didn‚Äôt know what was fair, and she traded it to me for 3k caps. I wouldn‚Äôt have known she even had it if it wasn‚Äôt in her vending, and it was a great convo with a super nice player.
---
Now it is
---
It looks like A raider base due to the tent hooks on the top ring
---
Well once it launches I‚Äôll hit you up on Xbox. I don‚Äôt get off work until like 5 est time
---
Skinwalker maybe?
---
It‚Äôs all free you dingleberry
---
Ooh, I like that. Prevaricate. Never heard it before, love expanding my vocabulary. üëç
---
ESO did the same thing. Shitty launch then got waaaaay better. Not quite this bad of a launch but the game wasn't nearly as fun.
---
True. I was hoping to avoid having to research each exact location it might spawn at and spending hundreds fast traveling but I guess I have to cause I hopped 40 times and didn't find it.
---
Stealth Archer time
---
It just works. That's his only line
---
Bethesda:  Did someone say Atoms??????
---
Anyone know where it's available free? They said from 10th June but PS4 version is still showing as ‚Ç¨35 euro for me on PS Store.
---
Oh yeah, that it's EA that's a given. I mean, there's no more Bioware, it's EA Bioware now. It's in the name. People just say Bioware for short. Just like Blizzard, except it's been Activision Blizzard for a while now.
---
They can also re-release Skyrim as pipboy game
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs all fanon and not official. Motown is not a canon location nor has Detroit ever been brought up in the games to my knowledge. Plus I feel like it‚Äôs more likely that this Vault 79 is located in or slightly outside Appalachia, since it‚Äôs featured in the promo image (which would imply its a location we can visit).
---
I think it's a mutated Swamp Ape!
---
and the article is dated for the 10th and yesterday was the 9th- put in a ticket
---
The update news has made me sad. Also feel let down by Bethesda, I appreciate games evolve but I‚Äôm left with a completely different game than the one I paid for on release. 
---
Rest in peace fallout, I‚Äôll miss you.
---
I played in the beta but took a break and now seeing the new quests I was wondering if those quests are still active?
---
You can only find the repairable one in boxes and such after you find the one on the tourist.
---
I don‚Äôt think they will. The real question is what will nukes do, and will there be closed off sections like can I nuke a npc settlement
---
They made a multiplayer game, and you don't like multiplayer games. It's just an advice about the most logical action you may take.
---
Or instead, keep grunting. Whatever you like more.
---
Personally I'm going to try and supply the new players with laser guns and handmades
---
Seems like an awful amount of effort just for the issues of one game, I couldn't do it, but im glad someone is.  Good job.
---
I'm probably one of the very few people who is a little sad about this.  I actually liked the wasteland without human NPCs; but I suppose I will adapt.
---
Is there a perk list for this build? How does it work while leveling?
---
Sorry you're triggered? I didn't wanna research over a dozen locations but I guess I have to.
---
Survival brought murder, but despite that a lot of people still didn‚Äôt kill eachother.
---
Now with Nuclear Winter, it‚Äôs time to bring out the fighting spirit.
---
I mean, there's this whole other game you can spend hundreds of hours on without touching the BR component, but no, let's allow the completely optional mode to ruin the entire thing.  That's completely logical. /s
---
They bloody well should how many of the fuckers can there be we have been nuking and killing them over and over for months. The numbers have to have gone down by now.
---
Yes and yes.  Check out the free event this week before buying if you are in doubt
---
this idea might.... fun! actually. gonna prepare 30 bottles first.... hehehe
---
Fanatical just put up a deal for $25 usd.
---
In GTA V i got stable 15fps i belive. PS4 is just too old.
---
Hopefuly it would let me play few next years. Those freezes, fps drops and DC are frustrating, but i was playing games on 400mhz ultra old PC, so nothing new for me. :D
---
You‚Äôll never catch me dead feeding these peasants! No dog food for you!
---
At the end of the trailer it was like ‚Äúdo you fight with them or with us‚Äù 
---
Maybe the questline is choosing to help settlers or helping raiders
---
the perk are part of that kind of build. What weapon you get is also important, and you can't really plan that...
---
I approve of this.
---
Make him lvl 100 and equip him with a bad ass lever action or something, he can run around helping players lay waste.
---
I would love to encounter him out there slaying stuff.
---
Just because you don't see them on reddit doesn't mean they arent there. PvP is really downvoted on the Reddit. 
---
Regardless of size this BR mode is an outlet for a good portion fo this community. If you don't like it don't play it man.
---
I‚Äôve got a be dragon I‚Äôm pretty sure is the Strongest Rifle in the game. It does over 2k w no perks or crits or stealth
---
I just read that it should go free at 7-8am PST.
---
You can't bring anything with you to lose
---
I second this. Just like when they added survival. New mode didn‚Äôt care. But if other people find aspects of this game they like or game modes and we can all fan girl talk about fallout and it‚Äôs lore I‚Äôm happy
---
BWAHAHAHAHAHA. Nice trolling.
---
Is it a free trial in the sense that I can just jump right in and not do any story? I kind of just want to try the game and not actually start the game and have to keep that save when I buy it
---
#justiceforwoobie #woobiegang
---
As far as I know, you get special rewards. But no idea what in particular.
---
Oh yeah, i didn't visit my love so long, i hope she will be our leader and we will will all of those crazy battles full of alcohol and drugs.
---
&gt;alcohol and drugs
---
Alcohol is a drug too!
---
^(I just want to point it out for those who aren't aware. It may make it seem like alcohol isn't that harmful, while illegal drugs are. This is not the case! Alcohol is actually one of the "hardest" drugs there is. Safe drinking and have a nice day! I'm a bot. :)^)
---
Those assholes won't be satisfied until we go back to a 8-bit isometric fifty shades of brown aesthetic that crashes every 16 minutes and has massive memory leaks.
---
Fuck that irrelevant rose colored glasses bullshit point of view
---
You say that like it's a bad idea, but if that were *my* intro to Appalachia?  I would never forget it. XD
---
Nope still have my ammo but logged in yesterday and lost all junk, even in my stash.  Well at least now i have 300+ more pounds to play with before I hit the stash limit..lol sucks
---
Calm down fanboy. It wouldn't even be surprising considering Bethesda history with this game. Nobody in their right mind would allow pvp in the game while also allowing to stack legendary effect like TSE. Yet Bethesda did it, and all this shit carry over to survival: a mode highly focused on pvp. Bethesda didn't even foresee groups of level 200 baiting and apeing people under level 20.
---
You spawn in a vault, walk outside. Do whatever you want. You don't have to do any story, but it helps with aid, plans, money and exp
---
It is 24 shown, meaning with out groups 24 can be on a server but you can join friends on a server bumping it upto 32 after that point no one can join that server.
---
I disagree, unless you can get the item outside survival (which you aren‚Äôt)you‚Äôre forced to play survival to get it.
---
What exact ammo? How long has it been since you played? Did you check your stash? There's not much detail here but I'd suggest submitting a ticket. It won't get the ammo back but maybe there was an issue when you stopped playing previously. At the very least ammo is easy to get here on the marketplace.
---
They HAVE to bring it over to survival. Hopefully, it's just the first step.
---
Dragon ?
---
Interloper?  It's got the legs, but it doesn't have the tentacles like the one in lucky hole.
---
Waste landers is supposed to be set after the fall of the queen so it would make sense that you couldn‚Äôt kill her anymore and that they add in vault raids or something in its place
---
I would actually love that, makes for a good story
---
I'll be joining you when it hits free on xbox, would you say its better for me to try playing with voice chat or to not bother
---
I dont believe its soley the ps4‚Äôs fault. I have great games that never dip in fps and peformance. God of War, resident evil 2, many others. The only games of mine that bluescreen erratically are fo76 and fo4.
---
What about the regular SB's though. Unless we're somehow able to manufacture the cure, it wouldn't make sense to have SB's spam gassing npc settlements.
---
Although, maybe that will be part of the new questline, inoculating the new population?
---
??? Yeah in the website build planner for fo76
---
I‚Äôve opened up a store in Flatwoods. Will give a free weapon to any newbies that pass bu
---
I said this once and people flamed for wanting to "ruin the premise of the game".
---
The thing is a lot of people don't want to pour any amount of time learning a competitive game because they simply don't care. A bunch of Fallout players, myself included, want to play the game at their pace and are not attracted by the competitive side of BR mode.
---
I mean, he can still get the Bloodied melee weapon this week for free if he does the Survival challenges, which aren't that hard.
---
I hope not. People like that tend to find something to be salty about no matter what.
---
Hey I Just wanted to Let you guys know that my suit of excavator power armor got duped out of nowhere. It got duped twice when i reloaded the game, I Think it is a bug that you guys will wanna check out.
---
Maybe some Responders.
---
Modus could try to recruit someone for the Enclave but it's not really in his character.
---
Rose want a new band so she is certainly tied with the new raiders of the trailer.
---
Free States... maybe a forgotten bunker?
---
Brotherhood, I hope not. Maybe some defeated veteran but for lore reason they can't survive as organization
---
Eh, there have definitely been stability improvements and other things that he might have seen. You're right, though, that a lot of improvements were later in the game.
---
Yeah, not like he directed the game or anything...
---
Yeah you‚Äôre definitely a new Vegas fan judging by the way you talk
---
I'm sorry but the base game is still busted to me and I'm expected to like a battle royale? My brother and I joked way back when 76 was first revealed it was likely going to be a battle royale, looks like our cracks at Bethesa's lack of originality is finally coming to fruition.
---
Its been on sale this hole time lol
---
Omg right?! I was like "seriously? the main story brings you here? To this?!?!"
---
R.i.p. my man. But now, hopefully we can see the valiant return of Woobie
---
Enjoy the story in the first town and don't rush to exit the Forrest. If you spot a high level player in your area, search for a brown bag, near their feet, some of us drop goodies. Also check the nukesanddragons character planner.
---
The better this game gets, the less likely we'll see a fallout five on any reasonable time schedule. Look at what happened with Grand theft Auto once they realized how big of a cash cow GTA online was
---
Thanks dude what source did you use ?
---
Yep.. gonna try to force you to play it to get them.
---
Could also be some idiot put "6" upside down lol
---
Well they decided to make a stupid BR instead of improving the game and making more content instead of chasing the BR trend. 
---
It's okay to admit your being used like an dumbass by Bethesda.
---
We should all get protest signs and do a demonstration outside of vault 76 where the admins are hiding.
---
 That's kind of the way I'm leaning, but then what purpose would nukes serve, besides farming ghouls or flora?
---
There is difference between open world game where every object is pickable and games that have limited "rooms" with only few chests. That's why minecraft have ugly graphic, complex world is hard to render.
---
Go away

I just want to be able to target melee hits at flying creatures in VATS again.

But this stuff looks good, too.

Except my charisma is balls, and I don't think I can respec my punching lone wanderer hoarder without losing him entirely.

i don't know, sorry

This has been my only complaint for the last few months. The yellow kills 3rd person for me.
---
Will do, thanks!
---
They don't need loot boxes. They've already proven people are willing to pay $18 for the color blue.
---
Not to mention nuka rum, duffle bags and chinese-made plastic power armor helmets.
---
I picked the wrong career. The gaming community is rife with suckers.
---
Beautiful.
---
It happens a lot after a nuke.
---
For a while after the nuke zone goes away, you still have flora and mobs dropping legendaries.  It seems to persist a while if there are a lot of players in the area.
---
Those weren't free events.  Ive been around enough online games that do free to play events to know how this goes.
---
Thank this person and their story about a feisty 22 year old pup

The real r/hydrohomie
---
Someone did this for me and it was amazing. The FO76 community is extremely underrated.
---
All 1\* stuff right?  Whitesprings always does that after the nuke evaporates.  I had legendary eyebots yesterday. I have seen legendary protectrons as well.  Usually the glowing ghouls persist for awhile excepts at the clubhouse.
---
You get to command the next patch of contenters, force them to do experiments for you, for rewards :)
---
The game is worth more so you‚Äôre getting a heck of a deal for $17. You‚Äôll have full access in the free week I assume.
---
Well, if you want do. You do know there's no respawns in BR?
---
I like to give out random power armor parts because they're 30+ levels from being useful and super heavy, but &lt;10 randos get excited when they see it. Also missiles and lead ore.
---
TLDR: 
---
I‚Äôve never played the game, but seen youtube videos of it.
---
Now I‚Äôm sending this message to the developers because I know this is the worst fallout game ever. Specially because of battle royale.
---
Did I get that right?
---
Most idiotic thing I‚Äôve seen on this sub.
---
I belive it will be new mode, or you will do some quest that will move you to another phase of world, but they can't leave scorchbeast as they are everywhere.
---
Wear pants, there's a lot of weirdos in the wasteland already.
---
Between the current respec and having multiple characters I feel like we have everything we need to experience every possible branch of the game. But that's just me. Exactly how often do you want to be able to respec your lvl 314 character?
---
I still can't find a place to download free trial just yet, but I did see that too. I am stoked, have been wanting to try this game out.
---
It's probably a ranking system to check your progress.  Or maybe after a set of matches it lets you sit in the big chair.
---
I *love* FO76...but I personally hate battle royale games and I, for one, am a little sad that human NPCs are being added.  I liked the wasteland just fine without them.
---
All I know is that if everybody doesn't go in with base characters (*no gear, no perks, no mutations, all the same health and AP*) then this mode is already dead in the water like PVP mode.
---
I haven't been able to find a list of what is coming. Have they released it yet or was it just announced?
---
What about patch? should i message gf to start PS4? :D
---
Yeah, all one star. There were legendary liberators in the golf club. Crazy
---
This makes the most sense but who knows.
---
I was just exploring west Tek for the first time like thirty minutes ago and I swear to God the temptation to just gleefully dive into the FEV vats was so strong I could barely stop myself even knowing it would just kill me.
---
Most of the negatives you heard were from people that never played the game and just made up shit.
---
It has issues, like every online only game, but it's nothing like they said it was.
---
You can use voice chat it is very handy and works well. Can also message other players though via Xbox messages as you would.
---
Welcome! We look forward to having ya!
---
I agree. Todd‚Äôs has some bad press recently but I‚Äôm willing to give FO76 another shot during the free trial. Now that we know they‚Äôre listening by bringing in NPCs I think it‚Äôs going to be a while new game.
---
I wonder how can the server handle 52 players, it can not even run with 6 ppl close by shooting enemies
---
In that case let's do this thing lol üòé
---
My plans are always 50% off (or free!)
---
Seems to be the only way they sell
---
Very nice I‚Äôve put out more crops and open purifiers for the new players.
---
Fallout 76 was a catalyst that destroyed all aspects of my social life online. And not in the ways you think. Not at all.  
---
I used to mod NV and 3. Made a couple small mods and was a part of something bigger from time to time. I gave that up, for people who currently don't care I exist and would encourage others to be wary of me.  
---
Jax, Kai, snekster, xporc, lunchbox, antistar, talkietoaster,  yuki, mil, naky, if you're readin this; I'm sorry
---
Whenever they introduce a change that fundamentally alters the significance and/or mechanics of one of the special stats, which I feel is what's happening here.
---
Every other thread on the front page is going to be this for the next few days...
---
Fair point. But I‚Äôm still standing by the belief that Bethesda isn‚Äôt good at making the best performing games. I will love them always, but they‚Äôre bad at debugging and all that.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure there are rewards like cosmetics and stuff you can get from it that you can bring back to adventure/survival mode
---
The funny thing is it was just me and my girlfriend and a level 20 running around haha. Good to know though. I didn‚Äôt see the nuke, there was one in the cranberry big, but there could have been one there before, I don‚Äôt know what the cool down time is.
---
Not sugar but complex carbohydrates.  That hasn‚Äôt changed since the 80s because a diet based in complex carbohydrates (think actual whole grains not pasta or bread) has a shitload of fiber.  The food pyramid is what happens when lobbyists for big ag get involved in the process.  The actual diet pushed by medical research hasn‚Äôt changed much.  Eat lots of plants with a little meat.  
---
In all honesty go check out what Dr Dean Ornish proposes.  He made a huge splash in the 80s for limiting the progression of various kinds of heart disease based on his proposed diet.  It‚Äôs a lot of beans, veggies and whole unprocessed grains with almost no animal products, salt or spices.  If heart disease is a very real concern this diet has been demonstrated to radically slow it down for most people.
---
Indeed, No Thalmer gunna tell me who to worship.
---
Who knew they were bringing stiltriders from morrowind?
---
Right!? I assumed the mole miners got her.
---
You should probably read the actual Bethesda notes about this. You keep your base Stats, but nothing else.
---
Just don't play the mode then, it's not that deep.
---
Game taste is subjective and as far as I can see this is just an outlet for those who like to PvP, no need to be toxic just because you aren't interested.
---
I just checked and i don't have an update.
---
How will OP ever recover?
---
If servers stop crashing, I give them another chance, but I am sure that will never happen
---
\*Imagines a army of Homers running through the wasteland eating everything they see\*

---
Potential new player here after the E3 announcements yesterday! Quick question the free trial this week, is it only the battle royale mode that I can trial, or the whole game?
---
so can anyone tell me how to play for free on pc? downloaded the bethesda client but there is only the option to buy. no trial.
---
yeah, well he has 30mn to do that , then ;)
---
cosmetics iirc,   its prob going to be very hard.   theres a lot of seasoned vets lol
---
Apologies, I got my terminology mixed up about the stores. 
---
Atomic Shop = Shiny items/cosmetics which use Atoms as currency / This currency can be obtained with real money or through playing the game and doing challenges, etc. 
---
In-Game Store = Uses Caps as a currency / This currency can be obtained obtained from playing game, missions, etc. 
---
One vendor uses Scrips / This currency is obtained from legendary items you earn and don't want. 
---
Have I summarised it correctly?
---
What's this about food now? Are you saying we can't just drink out of the toilet like normal people? What the hell kind of a wasteland are you people running over there?
---
I know it's only less than a half hour away, but a write-up on "Essentials For Newbs" would be grand.  What you should focus on first, "safe" builds, good early-game weapons, etc.
---
Thanks bud. Are you nervous as i am?
---
So my SPECIAL is the way I have it now as a level 146?
---
ohh the sheer horror when a newbie doesn't know about that and initially thinks you want to revive them.....
---
Seriously? It's not like they're going to be locking content behind fucking special checks. First of all just look at the example from the trailer, there's going to be multiple options available for different specials and options that don't even require checks. All that's likely to end up behind those checks are at the least extra flavor or lore and at best maybe easier or bypassed quest objectives.
---
Bloodied Explosive rifleman vat crit sneak build is pretty insane
---
No i compared bats to lich KINGS 
---
But yeah there would be a female ready for that spot if the current matriarch dies
---
Drat, now i see it too. It‚Äôs worse because I bought that paint.
---
Welcome to Appalachia, let's celebrate with nukashine. Brilliant.
---
Yeah I really dont want it to end up just like Battlefield V's Firestorm it was ok but to unlock certain things you were forced into playing it. Now its mostly a dead mode that you have to play from time to time to quickly unlock some weekly rewards. All the while stuck in long wait times for matches.
---
 They could do something like that for Vault Raids.
---
Yeah I do agree on that with you.
---
haha, oh yeah, social media hates the game - Fallout is one of my top favorite game franchises but I don't spend any time on the respective subreddits, outside of what I see on the main feed (such as now).
---
I play the game, I enjoy it, I always see other people on.  That's really all I worry about.
---
Most of it I consider to be recreational outrage anyway.
---
Don‚Äôt become overwhelmed with how much is thrown at you early on post-tutorial. If you have a working knowledge of the other titles (F3 &amp; beyond), not much will be foreign to you other  than the self care stuff like eating and drinking.
---
Holo tapes are, and I‚Äôm being modest here, 8 times longer than they used to be. Although they are worth listening too, as are reading various notes/terminal entries, because if you care about the lore/story, this is pretty much the only way you‚Äôll decipher where everyone is/what happened. Cheers and see you on the other side of the door!
---
800 already isn't enough. Why would I want more competition for loot and exp at the expense of what I can pick up? Limiting stash size / cap limit is a poor way of "handling" the economy in my opinion.
---
Do check the story though. Some people dislike environmental storytelling, so at least give it a try.
---
Deciding which faction lives or dies? That could be the ending to it
---
They eased up on it though. It used to be "Take a picture of another player in power armor next to mothman while fighting a deathclaw....
---
For 20 atom."
---
I'll bet 100 caps there are still static spawns that knowledgeable players can take advantage of.
---
Lol. Okay.
---
Wait you keep you stats? Damn, so what happens if your under level 50, you just can‚Äôt play? My builds a mess.
---
I mostly spawn on the spot where, they put the main C.A.M.P item down, the toolbox looking thing. If you wall it up, ppl spawning in can not get out :)
---
Lots of people wanted it from day 1.  It's very clear they have a team of people working on PvP things (normal pvp, survival mode, nuclear winter, etc) and a team working on the PvE things.  Since the game has always aimed to be multi-faceted like that, I don't think there is any validity in complaining about the PvP modes being added because it somehow takes away from the PvE piece.  They are separately allocated resources that were always set that way.
---
I have 240 hours in this game now... I have NEVER had more than 1000 caps on me at any one time.
---
That's the way it sounded. You keep your SPECIAL stats where they are, but no perks/mutations/gear/chems are carried in. You have to find weapons and armor in the event, and it has it's own perk sets.
---
Yes it would!
---
Means you have other cards on your build you could get at that time atleast that's how I saw it.
---
You got it! You can also get all kinds of outfits and power armor paints in game as well, by collecting them yourself for free or buy them from other players with caps.
---
I wish the best for Bethesda. But they always take 1 step forward, 2 steps back.
---
I wonder if they know of some of the disrespectful bugs in fo76, such as the 3* wood armor and Disappearing legendary perks from putting on skins..
---
I got destroyed because a lvl 180 ran through there, OWWWW. I finally killed them all then i got kicked off the server.ser
---
I'll check it out.  I'm a huge believer in animal products though.  They share basically same composition as us and have been proven to be one of the most readily absorbed forms of nutrition for humans.  This is funny a game post where we discuss nutrition.  I cant have this "debare" on the keto forms cuz I get fucking locked out.  And these are the discussions that are needed.  One size doesnt fit all and the idea that animal products are bad is ludicrous (not saying your saying that) and also this idea that veggies wre evil and horrible is ludacris.  It's not so simple and if we wanna figure this stiff out guess what...we need to discuss it and study it.  Same goes for gaming and all media stop trying tk shut people down and censor and lock out.  Wr need more discussion more talk more disagreements and voices
---
I think that's why we're seeing new mutants and stuff.
---
Uh, it's the Onion, dude.  You may be missing the point.
---
Lol. Well I'm impressed! I'll take that cure!
---
You can have up to five characters on an account at one time and can delete the characters at any point and start a new one.
---
If the servers hold up at all, good luck not Disconnecting!
---
I would like that!
---
Dear God. I do NOT want shroud here. If he comes then so do all the other twitch streamers and then this game mode will be impossible to win and get the exclusive stuff for the average player.
---
&gt;You have no endgame.
---
Was this not the same in FO4 though?  Kill/blow up someone/something and that's kinda it.....after that it's what you make of it....
---
Ok sir, no need to talk  if you havent played the two games.
---
OOTL who is Woobie?
---
Whos that? someone importat? hah
---
Yeah like why are you charging so much for that stupid plan?! Lol
---
It is not the bug itself, but the red tape that involves a fix.  Think about it - the company probably can't have someone just go in and fix something without steps being followed to help maintain some quality control.
---
I probably wouldn't be playing until tonight and cant even remember where I left off at. Im pretty sure I was using a Rifle build and eating canned dog food because of some perks I had which let me find more cans when searching and got some extra benefits from eating dog food. 
---
Not sure how viable or smart it was to go that route so ideally id start a new character and follow a more meta build. Any idea where to find a full Bloodied perk guide or a build on Nukes and Dragon I can level with?
---
The human NPC who is trapped in the dev room
---
That's sweet and kick ass!
---
Huh? I thought dropping it could work. Good luck on your search
---
Okay.  Then I'm skipping this.
---
SPECIAL stats can change a lot about a fight.  It should be everybody on the same playing field, 100% base characters, relying on gear found and wits.
---
What's going to happen is people min/maxing SPECIAL specifically for PVP and taking those characters in.  It's going to end up like Survival just without Legendary gear.
---
I just don't understand why they are using a ring of fire instead of a radio active storm. The radiation system and  radio active storms are part of the series for a long time. At the beginning of the radio active zone you would only get a little bit radiation damage, but the more the storm progresses the more radiation damage you get.
---
Hope they work them back into the story line somehow. I would love to see faction specific events and rewards.  I think if they structure it similar to the Ever Upwards quest it would work.  
---
They just need to have a faction HQ for each group and put some NPC's, including a leader (questgiver) inside.  They can give you quests and missions to advance in rank and then give you "points" that allow you to get specialized gear, cosmetics, and plans.  
---
Hopefully they can get this going at some time rather than just the generic raiders vs. settlers.  But I won't complain since we are getting some humans back!
---
That mode will be so broken initially.
---
With a thumbnail of a vault dweller with his thumb down.
---
oh shit thats right, my character has 1 charisma - i've never put a single bit of anything into it
---
Ton of bug fixes and new content. Experience the game and then ask specific questions if you get stumped. We‚Äôll try and answer them. Enjoy!
---
Ohhhh, so the battle Royale mode is a paid dlc? Im actually happy with this. Now less ppl will be inclined to play only BR. Bethesda gets more money so they can hire better people to debug.
---
First time paid DLC is a good thing lol
---
For me the biggest problems were the disconnects. But it‚Äôs way better now
---
To play assholes advocate here, some people genuinely do only care about the story. I'm not one of them, but they exist.
---
First off, super rude. Second of all, just because someone isn't skilled with computers doesn't make them stupid. I'm just the kind of person who's more suited to constructive tasks and problem solving than tech in general. And the shopping around thing ONLY works if A: you know what your looking for/need. B: You don't live in Canada where for some unknown reason all tech is like 50% more expensive than US. Plus the general fact that a week after you bought a PC atleast part of it will be obsolete. I just prefer the reliable functionality of a console.
---
Man, thats a funny onion article, but no i cant. I played F76 on Day 1, for about a week, and was way too disappointed with the clunky bugs, its the first fallout game that i havent liked and I have played 1-4 plus Shelter. I just started playing again 2 days ago, trying to give it another shot, but the fucking bugs and the clunky CAMP system, i cant do it, this game is too much of a chore to play. I liked the settlement building in F4 but this is just too much menial effort, and maintenance, and babysitting, im giving up. Just gonna go replay F4 for the fifth time i suppose
---
Yeah but this game makes it easier to ignore them. The other day in my CAMP (I started a new character so I'm around lvl 30) arrived 2 high levels shooting and dumping, since I didn't do anything (thank you for no Damage to CAMP+damage reduction when not in combat) they started teasing me with the puke emote. I just ignored them and when I was done with my CAMP stuff went to keep on questing.
---
Griefers are at most annoying here, but not really dangerous if you don't retaliate.
---
Mas dakaka porfavor.
---
Still waiting for the Service Rifle, 5mm Carbine, and anything we can get from Gun Runner Arsenal
---
Oh no, you need actual skill to land shots instead of pushing the magic aimbot button, tragic.
---
Wonder how much he earned there sitting going oohhhhh yeahhhhhh this is so goooood
---
And yeah I'm jealous
---
I know they are there, Im not disputing that people want BR in 76... You are proof of that afterall. Im simply disputing your notion or implication that the majority of Fallout players want BR in 76, thats all.
---
Don't get "a good portion" mixed up with the majority. Your "good portion" is still an extreme minority. So please don't speak for the masses on the desire of BR in 76, because the masses dont want BR in Fallout. 
---
I just wanted to point out that a few people's desire to not dictate or represent the community as a whole. Something you were trying to do.
---
Ill be surprised if the BR servers can maintain a full 52 players per match even one week after it releases.
---
Hello kitty
---
Keep an eye out for the Leader of the Pack Event in the Forest Region for low level legendary gear.
---
A 10mm Pistol, Hunting Rifle and Pump Shotgun can go a long way at the start of the game, until you can craft or find better weapons.
---
Eat and Drink, you don't need to do it often, but you start to take damage if you're Starving/Dehydrated so you can't fast travel.
---
Well that's pretty delusional wanting battle royale when the game was still in a literally unplayable state.
---
The what?!
---
My guess is once you reach overseer you unlock the hellfire armor
---
Top 2 amongst annoyances for me. Also I put my floor a lil to far in the water and now I cant move it at all. It use to be where u could destroy it and now u cant even do that. So now I spent hrs on my house with 2 pieces of floor in water that I cant move rrrrrrrrrrrr.
---
Heard about that one from a friend but haven't experienced it.  Xbox and PC.
---
I just wish they would tweak survival mode and fix the annoying bugs before rolling out another game option. 
---
I hate being highlighted on the map in the top 3.  That‚Äôs just dumb.  If they did nothing else but remove that feature the game would be 500% better. 
---
People will not play survival mode because of it and logging in and making the top 3 sucks.
---
I'm actually a bit excited for it. Never been interested in BRs, but balanced PvP is, in my opinion, a plus for the game, no matter the game mode. Here's to hoping they expand it a bit and add 6v6, free for all, or conquest style modes in the future. A lot of the locations in game could make amazing maps for PvP.
---
I made a post about the same thing last night.  I've completed the main mission (nuke launch on SBQ) so I welcome the advance in story.  But what happens for new players or if I create a new toon?  Definitely interested to see how it works out.
---
While I myself do usually entertain offers, I also will ignore you if you are annoyingly trying to haggle. It's in the machine for a reason. Buy it if you want it, if not move on. I don't really care what your Wasteland Pickers Price Guide tells you it's worth. 
---
You're not buying because you're a skin flint. I've got 4 more characters with max caps, that says that my pricing is juuuuust fine ; ) .
---
I was thinking about this too, I've been playing a lot of Nuka world and would love a RedEye style radio host that tells funny stories and is a lot less official sounding than the more prominent radio stations in fallout games
---
Incoming Twitch streamers trying to get everybody that kills them banned for "stream sniping".
---
Now I do
---
All day searching free version, cant find
---
Nice! Make sure you go into Adventure, though.
---
To be perfectly honest I didn't think they would add NPC's or show this much support for the game after the launch that was a small scale disaster. Really happy for the community and a sincere Thank You Bethesda.
---
Now imagine getting hundreds of hours out of that pizza lol, that's what this game will be at that price, but little tip, even if you love pvp, play in adventure mode until you are at least lvl 50, and have your build sorted out. Survival mode is just a free for all, and the high levels will kill newbies regardless of level.
---
Three dog wasnt official, just charismatic as fuck.
---
I‚Äôm on pc mate
---
Kill, murder, grief, wave then drop water.
---
Might want to add the /sarcasm. . . Doubt he'll pick up on it if ya don't. Just saying, lol.
---
I wonder if we‚Äôll see Charleston, Watoga, and Flatwoods repopulated
---
That's one thing Bethesda would never do.
---
If Bethesda remade Fallout 1,2 and three in the Skyrim engine they still wouldn't be happy. However Im hoping their hated would slowly poison them and the the toxic community they live in would dwindle as people got back into them.
---
I see [Toothless](https://imgur.com/a/r4V3hQS) ...
---
That is a good point lol
---
Dignity cost more than anything they can give to him.
---
Being a sellout pretending to like stuff when your bank account gets bigger has a cost on its own.
---
Learn to read idiot, they've already explained this shit. The only gear that's even going to exist for this mode is going to be non legendary weapons and armor sets. You can't even pick up individual armor pieces, it all comes as an entire set when you find something. It is literally impossible for anyone to build a meta set of armor or weapons.
---
Isn't Motown considered Detroit?  Are you thinking the raiders from Vault 79 migrated to Appalachia?  
---
Maybe Bethesda will just drop in a  new vault somewhere like they did with Vault 51.
---
I don't think they would do that, I'm just saying that these asshats will be all over social media whining about it and trying to further ruin 76's reputation.
---
The circle could be better with  snow &amp; blizzard instead of fire (nuclear winter and fallout thing)..
---
That jumped out at me too.  I am looking forward to see what comes of it.
---
I did, i played both. The only good thing of F76 is the illumination system, compared to F4. Everything else seems it's mediocre, and copied from a mediocre ps3 game. Awful textures, bad animations, slow loadings, bad pop in......etc
---
Crows are trash birds. Damn nature, I'm done with nature.
---
I understand their point, but it just wouldn't work. Taking away basic skills like aiming by allowing vats and critical builds would really hurt the experience. It's definitely for the best and I agree with the decision.
---
That just says when updates typically happen. And what it doesn‚Äôt say is it may start at that time but normaly it takes 3-4 hours to update
---
1.  It seems a weird choice after you: 
---
     a.  Make a huge point that you‚Äôre listening to the players who stuck it out; and
---
     b.  Note that they seem more interested in being kind than murdering each other. 
---
Why would you then add a mode base on them doing something they have been disinclined to do by and large? Especially when that market is already saturated. 
---
Worst case: you burn the fans that were willing to wait it out by bringing in that more adversarial crowd. Best case you wasted opportunity and resources  on something no one asked for because it was part of your vision. 
---
Neither result jives with: We appreciate the loyal fans and we listen to what you say. 
---
2. Nothing is ever free.
---
Just Todd blessing you with free scrip items
---
This is true.
---
Where do you see? All Fallout 76 DLC are free, the 50% probably is on the complete game
---
Maybe they can put in a "old world" mode, but I don't think nuking the queen would be mandatory to unlock the "new world", given the fact that there'll probably be less people to play and less higher level toons.
---
Awesome! Thanks for the additional insight!
---
My social media is full of smarmy commentary from bewildered persons not understanding why NPCs are a big deal. My assumption is that they simply haven't played Fallout 76.
---
I get what Bethesda was trying to do with the initial launch... robot vendors and found media revealing the horrors of post-War Appalachia, the concept was good but the execution meant that a lot of players didn't really connect with the storyline.  Who cares that so-and-so lost his dog? So-and-so is dead, and has been dead for awhile. So is his dog. So is everyone.
---
Introducing NPCs is going to add a lot of depth to Appalachia.
---
I'm not excited about the Battle Royale gameplay but that's just because it's not a play style I enjoy. I don't play Survival for that same reason. Not my cup of tea.
---
Put atom shop skins on everything that you can. Then they don't even pop up in the trade menu. Now if only they'd give us a damned Gatling Gun skin I'd quit getting a holes requesting my BE &amp; AAE Gatling Guns. If I wanted to sell them I wouldn't be carrying them Einstein.
---
My Pip Boy clock was broken when I got involved in a Death Claw Mirelurk threesome.
---
I enjoy BR, looking forward to it in FO76.  I am terrible at it, but is fun even so.
---
True. They are a whole team, not just one person. It would be a bigger mess than it already is, if everyone just went in and tried to fix stuff.
---
Maybe they're already existing perks?
---
Better min/max your SPECIAL for PVP is you want to stand a chance, I guess.
---
Low level players without full SPECIAL are screwed.
---
The post on their site does mention a smaller map.
---
I don't think you'll be able to nuke again tbh, would be pointless in the new story... and, storywise, you already used up the nukes :D
---
At least you'll always that memory.
---
Let us not forget the blatant lying.
---
Shoot shit, use your stimpaks smartly, make a camp and get water purifiers as soon as possible, they make good selling material as well as being your main source of water towards endgame
---
I don't think anything other than the faschnacht event was removed. You can still start and complete lying lowe, nukashine, ever upwards, and all the other quests/events that came out during wild appalachia
---
Max out the Can Do perk. I slap that on and hit up the water park, whitesprings and watoga for trash cans.
---
I hope it‚Äôs already in the files
---
You can always delete that save also yes it‚Äôs a free trial all week
---
Yeah I get that, but all satire is based on truth.
---
What information is outdated?
---
It‚Äôs going to suck shit and be another ghost town
---
I‚Äôm level 100 and I still am not even halfway to the cap limit
---
It works for my minigun
---
That would be pretty stupid of them wouldnt it...
---
It has a chance to proc every time you start firing. This makes it pretty meh on most heavy weapons.
---
Also make sure pacifist mode is on unless you want to pvp. Claiming workshops will put you in pvp even if pacifist is on.
---
Nuclear Summer
---
Horrid? That's one of the best analogies I've seen on Reddit!
---
Enjoy that!  I‚Äôve seen it a few times and def a bug. The golf club will spawn liberators or protections. I‚Äôve ran that same bug before and noticed the lighting in the golf club wouldn‚Äôt load and had to use my headlamp to see. With that many spawns it was a nice change of pace.
---
Could be interesting, though I think I would have liked to have seen a better system for player interactions and decisions first.
---
Having players be able to band together into small groups building united camps (that would be placed as a single camp whenever one player was on a server and the others in the group being sent to that server when they joined), so players would start to recognize different groups and their settlements. 
---
Having a way to send quick easy messages to other players and to 'shout' to other players in an area to ask for help or offer would also be nice. Maybe a 'help'  flare that would signal players that you were looking for help and would let them fast travel to you? Maybe some help, maybe some don't, but would be nice to start having those interactions more.
---
More player interaction would have been a nice place to start before they added NPCs as the system already has terrible lag issues (xbox for me) and seems to make dealing with inventories painful. I can only imagine it will be tougher adding all those NPCs and companions to the system.
---
Well, they did deleted all PC players game files when starting 4hours long beta. Everything is possible, that's why i am asking :D
---
Not sure that's the right use for the word Delusional.  Despite the fact that there were definitely bugs, I had no trouble playing the game at launch (nor did most people) -- so "literally unplayable" also doesn't apply here.  It was not stable, but it was playable and enjoyable, especially for my group of friends.  It is perfectly acceptable and expected to have people who are enjoying a live service game start thinking about things they'd like to see in the future.
---
I dont see where to download the trial in the launcher
---
You do realize that they still had to acquire the rights to use the song right? I‚Äôm almost positive that covering it was purely a creative decision
---
I havent seen it

Ah! Okay, Fortnite did that where they let you 'respec' all your characters before the chance 1 time. Is that something you'd be cool with? Like maybe you get a week from your first login after the change to do a total respec. I just can't see being down for a total respec at any time. Kinda of removes the challenge.
---
I wouldn't worry they are probably paid to play it for like a week only
---
From what I have seen it‚Äôs the full game. Come join! I‚Äôve stuck it out since day 1, and I‚Äôm loving it
---
As long as they stay in the BR &amp; the Atom Shop I'm cool with it. I'd hate to think of Adventure mode being mucked up.
---
No one is speaking for the masses besides you, man.
---
The mode is more than likely gonna bring much needed attention to the game and honestly looks pretty cool. 
---
The numbers will show in the end, however plenty of people wanted a legitimate PvP mode, you don't have numbers, no one does. However the PvP community is way more present outside of Reddit, and I'm sure finding a full match will never be an issue so oh well
---
Yeah, the dog food perk is amazing, I think most people run it. It's extremely common and becomes one of the best healing food items in the game. There aren't that many perks you need - nerd rage is one, some people use born survivor to stay near death but not too close to death. Serendipity is an absolute must. Sneak perks work well with bloodied because they are a straight multiplier to already ridiculous damage. The rest depends on what weapon(s) you will be using
---
I am thoroughly excited for both updates. I couldn't believe how fucking sour and dismissive the Game Spot stream hosts we're about FO76. was obvious they haven't touched it since launch because it's a pretty awesome game now. And to everyone passive aggressively shitting on Bethesda for putting NPCs in "when they should've been there the whole time", you kind of just suck at life. Nothing makes you happy, huh?
---
Any idea how to download trial on the PS4? Can't seem to locate it and the game page still asks me to purchase
---
When talking about it the devs talked about how much they enjoyed working on it and that it was their passion. I mean ya part of it probably is for money but they seemed to be doing it cuz it seemed fun. I have yet to play it but with the PVE functionality it seems interesting
---
Don't rush it, you have a week which should give you more than enough time to explore and enjoy the game and all it has to offer. Go at your own pace, explore, visit camps, listen to the holotapes and read the terminal entries - pretty much what has been said already. If you get stuck, or need some advice, just ask.
---
We need to be able to pet cats in game, not shoot them! I see a kitty, I want to pet it! They should show up as neutral like brahmin! * I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll be downvoted for this, but idc.
---
Because the early patches you had to essentially redownload the entire game. They've since fixed it so recent patches are smaller. No idea how much it actually takes.up.with save data though, but 50gb should be accurate for the initial download.
---
Yes! There were liberators in there. So weird I‚Äôd never seen legendary ones before
---
Yes! I got it for $25 and it has been more than worth it. If you're a Fallout fan then it would be a misservice to completely miss out on this game. It can be awkward and painfully amateur at times, but the devs put a lot of love and care into the game. You'll get 17 hours easy just playing the MQ.
---
I see, that's weird, well that explains it then, thank you
---
I think they‚Äôll do something about the low level thing, seems like an obvious flaw in the game. But me, well, I‚Äôm a good PVP‚Äôer im general and was ok at the mode, but I think my weapons did that for me.
---
 Maybe they‚Äôll reset special to 0 and everyone starts even and all weapons do base damage  so it counters the low level problem an the people like me who screwed their build.
---
Absolutely
---
Can't help you bud, I only saw picture in another post, where was fallout 76 downloadable free at PS4 store.
---
Suggestion: next time you do a long post spend more time on the text formatting.
---
I guess if you are playing mostly solo (no PVP) it won't be an issue. Right?
---
Happy cake day!
---
You can't turn on/off pacifist mode until level 5 in adventure. In survival it is stupid to turn on.
---
I haven't found a single TSE anything in this game since release
---
Best response so far. Thanks.
---
I kind of wonder if they'll give us control of the ATLAS weather machine over the summer? Maybe we can make it snow in random spots and it will freeze enemies and camp water purifiers
---
Now, when you can't harm the CAMP in adventure mode I really see no reason to lock the house. 
---
You don't want to share extractors nor purified water - cool, your decision, but locking house is irritating, especially when simultaneously you didn't check spawn point for visitors - I can't count situations when I spawn inside closed house and only way to get out is to fast travel to another location. Which obviously results in that, that I won't visit your shop...
---
Clicking that link though still sends me to purchase it from the game page, not a free trial offer
---
Both of these are spot on! Plus make sure to always check suitcases at RR stations. When we drop stuff for new players or those who need them, we drop them there or at the Overseer camp.
---
I vote for someone called something like "Appalchia Al" and he has a thick country mountain man accent.
---
I have been expecting this for some time, and it great to see confirmation from BGS.  Exciting stuff ahead!
---
Maybe it‚Äôs different for energy weapons?
---
ok smarty pants, please grace us with your infinite knowledge and let us know what you would consider got tier melee then
---
Nice. Thanks for this.
---
Welcome to the wasteland, I‚Äôve seen some posts already of folk saying they will be setting up camp near the vault to help kit new players out with some helpful stuff, keep your eyes peeled for brown paper bags on the floor, if a player drops something for you a brown bag appears on the floor near their feet, also if a player is trying to get your attention on an overseer cache or suitcase e.g flashing their power armour headlamp or shooting a weapon at a suitcase or overseer cache it probably means they put some stuff in there for you. Have fun out there x
---
Probably
---
Right there with ya! I can't seem to find the free trial link on ps4, any luck?
---
I ran out of screws...
---
Level 1 for all :
---
Flaming pitchfork
---
Pipe pistol
---
Leather armour
---
1x NukaShine
---
Add in the random outfits I've collected.
---
I try and keep 1 set in stock in the filthy casuals vendor, but it tends to get nabbed by someone going 'ooh! Free armour! Oh. It's level 1. Scrapping that.'
---
I will absolutely not tolerate this defamation of the brotherhood
---
Sweet, sweeeeeeEEEeeeeet C.A.M.P. plans. 
---
I need no other motivations (I may have a problem).
---
If they could make it as confusing if not more than Arktos that would be a great place for a BR. Adding my panic of being lost to fighting people would be some intense gameplay
---
A small price to pay for salvation
---
A vault only PVP thing sounds less like BR and more like Arena death match lol
---
Well at least they gave us a heads up! Like 30 mins before it happens.
---
Subs gonna be flooded with cant log in posts and unannounced maintenance complaints.
---
I played both at launch and I disagree. They both had very very bad launches.
---
Maybe One Dog, the predecessor to both Two Dog and Three Dog
---
I post here quite often, and brows new a lot. I see post only a few minutes old sitting at 0 to -5 dominating the feed for long periods of time.
---
Pikachu armor!
---
you are the only one.  Start drilling.
---
Thats cool as fuck, i love seeing the things people build on here
---
honk honk
---
Lmao. Just "Dog"
---
Literally unplayable, it was so bad my wife left me
---
Thanks, you are good boy/girl. Would give you cookie, if you weren't intenet thing.
---
It's live?
---
Lootboxes, get your loooootboxes here!  
---
What lootboxes?  
---
These swell FO76 loooootboxes over here!  
---
I see no lootboxes.  
---
Yeah, but you're just a Bethesda shill suffering from the sunk cost fallacy!  Everybody knows F976 is just lootbox riddled P2W crap!  
---
Ok, whatecver, man.
---
cats&gt;dogs, 
---
but yeah, we need some good boy pictures too
---
There are community managers and people who be reached out to. If someone makes a claim like this or others, we verify, or remove the posts / claims if they cant be verified.
---
Alright I‚Äôll get on that
---
That's exactly my thoughts a lvl playing field where everyone starts fresh each match. Count me in there ! 
---
     This is what should have been done on survival mode that's why I don't play it but it is tempting to give a go anyway.
---
Research? For fuck sake googling "fallout 76 tourist locations" gives you the list without even having to click a link, dear God the horror.
---
Stop acting like a spoiled twit just because people pointed out that your plan to cheese the tourist by server hopping and then crying it was too hard was arguably the least efficient way to possibly do it.
---
Wasteland dlc?
---
Damn, hope i can see it when trial starts  
---
Looking forward to have fun with the game x)
---
They are the two things I love the most, and pair really well, plus I'm kinda hungry lol.
---
Are you serious or just trolling?
---
Gotta hit the CAMPS! You can get them sorta cheap since bloodied and AAE are more popular, now.
---
The TSE Black Powder Rifle I got from the purveyor but the rest I got from CAMPs or Marketplace.
---
That would be nice, and it does suggest that as you level up you gain more ranks and more access...but ultimately only the overseer (winner) will have full access. For non-pvp players like myself (I haven't really played any PVP games outside of WoT and WoW since battlefield 2142) even getting up to the ranks where you can really get good access will be tough...I just don't know if I want to devote that much time to just playing a PVP game. 
---
I know it's my choice, but it's unfortunate that they would tie the rewards and the game experience of the one mode (adventure) to how well you can do in another mode PvP BR. Would have been nice if there was another way to do it...even if it meant grinding through a number of daily missions that would be fine if it at least gave me the option.
---
In the end I guess we'll see how it goes, though I suspect you'll quickly see a lot of the same players coming up as winners in the BR mode just because they're better at the PVP or learn the tricks to it.
---
Game will go into maintenance in 10minutes, so you can't play, but i saw post, that you can start donwloading "trial version" on PS4.
---
Starting new fallout 76 char. This time I go junkie melee.. annnnnd stealth archer with backup pistol
---
I agree! I'm more of a dog-person than a cat-person but I mean what ex-Vaulter wouldn't want to become a crazy cat-person in the wilds of Appalachia? Just you and your 43 cats living in your rustic shack overlooking a nearby Super Mutant camp.
---
Kitties are strict carnivores so they can stay fed by all the leftover Super Mutant goo whenever they foolishly try to overwhelm your base defenses. Everyone wins!
---
I have an xbox one x and it can‚Äôt even run smoothly while placing things in my camp. Imagine how bad it will get with double the amount of players per server on a supposedly smaller map.
---
You tell me to learn to read but I posted my first comment here before they even shared their blogpost online. Nice try.
---
Good to know, thanks, need the Xbox version tho. :D
---
It seems like you don't actually bring anything into this mode from Adventure/Survival.  Only things that transfer are cosmetic items, CAMP blueprints (without materials), and SPECIAL points (although they dont provide passive bonuses in this mode).  You are rewarded with XP &amp; Caps that will deposit on the Adventure side of your character.  That's most of what we know so far!
---
Laugh at their misery.
---
I know, right? Even with the problem of not having enough budget, people doesn't stop making awesome things.
---
I got the entire clubhouse full of lvl 1 Legendary Eyebots the other night. I'd heard of this before, but 1st time ever seeing it for myself. Every corpse contained a (shitty) legendary. Eh, free scrip? Lol.
---
Thanks for the welcome, friendlies; I'm going to grab the download as soon as it shows up on the PSN store. Are we all logging into the same server? Or are there shards to join?
---
ZOO WEE MAMA
---
Im just saying its a stupid thing to do..... definitely possible they will do it though
---
I played at launch for a good month or so. I had a reasonable amount of ammo for everything that someone would have only using melee weapons. Now I have like 3-4 of each. Which is pretty much losing so much.
---
So it's best to fire in bursts then to get it to proc. That would be tough on players using gat weapons.
---
Uh, dude, that's literally not true. I watched my friend stream when it first dropped. He was able to fight players and enemies. Only glitch he got was a ghoul tposing
---
Then you can use them as human shields
---
sounds so much better than survival mode. nothing to loose but everything to gain
---
There‚Äôs always people having trade parties, including myself. Love the player interactions and community.
---
We need to make a separate reddit page for login errors and "is the game worth buying" discussions lol.
---
Thanks I‚Äôm a little more encouraged to do them now they don‚Äôt seem that bad!
---
It's a free week. Chill out with the Shakespearean live long enough to see yourself become the villain stuff.
---
My guess is you'd have a specific character tied to that game mode, separate from your mains.  That's my hope anyways.
---
Im sorry but after all the lying there apology means shit. Their words hold no value from canvas bags, to the alcohol bottles, to the shit ton of bugs, to the supposed increase in detail etc.
---
The ad is live, yes, but clicking it still sends me to the game page to purchase. No sign of "free trial"
---
Ive built myself a cowtapult and i might today build like some kind of plinko board to fire said cows into, idk like a whitespring carnival!
---
Boy did you respec your points from INT?
---
Which platform?
---
they wouldn't dare take the nukes away
---
Love it !
---
patch should go live in 10 minutes so i guess, there shouldn't be issue for new players.
---
Its real. It happened to me earlier this week. At one point 9 in a row dropped for me. One run netted over 30 legendary drops
---
Zombie games never died. Just pretty many zombie games for a while. Its making a very strong comeback now actually. Days gone, last of us 2, dying light 2 etc...
---
Great Post, Thank You, for all your efforts to support both the game and the community.
---
I admit that I have been more than a little upset by some of the issues with this game, mostly with the PVP aspects and other players exploiting the game mechanics to ruin others gameplay, but as a long time FO fan, I stayed the course knowing that it would all be fixed eventually.
---
I did a lot of Programming (Coding) 20+ years ago, mostly for CAD systems, but also dabbled in some games, I'm not the least bit knowledgeable when it comes to current game programming, but do understand the complexity.
---
Implementing changes in a large corporate environment can be a daunting task, sometimes requiring reviews, presentations, authorizations, more reviews, and approvals to make what seems a very simple and insignificant change, as a Project Manager I deal with this on a daily basis, and like everything else for which there are rules, the "Red Tape" is there because something bad happened before.
---
Keep up the Great Work, you have my appreciation for supporting my Favorite game franchise.
---
When is the free trial avaliable? Have a friend i want to get on.
---
Timezones are weird
---
The guy to the right of the power armor looks like he's got the laser musket on his back, too.
---
Yeah for a ridiculous amount of caps lol. I saw a tse shotgun for like 8k. I've never amassed more than 4k through out my time in the wasted.
---
I noticed that switching to a different weapon or allowing the enemy to come closer fixes the issue.
---
I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll just remove nukes from the game. Nuking is the entire endgame. I think it‚Äôs much more likely that the scorched plague still haunts Appalachia, but it‚Äôs a lot more under control than it was in year one. It‚Äôs known that the scorchbeasts get a new queen a while after the previous is killed, so it‚Äôs possible that the only way to contain the threat is by continually nuking Fissure Site Prime.
---
Turn on pacifist mode right away and don‚Äôt claim a workshop (it initiates pvp), at least for awhile.  And store your junk often so you don‚Äôt lose it all if someone takes it when you die.
---
I can imagine for the next few days, there will be a crowd of people waiting at the Vault for new players to emerge. Look at it from their point of view. 
---
You come out, breathing in the strange new air, assaulted by the unknown smells and your begin to hear alien noises, practically blinking in the light, and as you regain focus there are 18 people standing silently, dressed in anything from underwear and tin hats, to skull adorned power armour, holding a whole plethora of guns, bats, knives, and to top it off, for some bizarre and unknown reason, you are surrounded by paper bags.
---
I'd turn around and go right back in and wait for the oxygen to stop.
---
Don't get me wrong, i'm sure you can fix a lot of the stuff, and A LOT more than i'll ever be able to! 76 is just an online game, so it's a more delicate process than trying to fix a singleplayer game.
---
And again, i am sure that you know a lot more than i do about this, so you are more than welcome to correct me, because learning something new is always a good thing.
---
üòÇüëåüèº
---
I couldn't see why not, but even so I think they did the "first main" quest how it is on purpose. It's kinda just a bread crumb trail, honestly just a better typical theme park quests than other mmo's. 
---
Woah, I just noticed you would be finding the overseers logs as people are coming back, and I think that would make her very happy haha
---
Looks like we ARE getting nuclear winter today then, awesome! Two minutes away! Time to finish up work for the day to binge this when it's done
---
Do you really think he gets paid to watch E3..... dont be a moron.
---
My point is, fanboys are blind, and always asking for gimmicks instead of new true contents. Getting excited for something is still under development, considering the massive let down F76 is still to this day is just stupid.
---
"16 time the detail...."
---
dunno, doesn't seem like it'd make sense anymore to have them if there won't be any more scorched around, like it should be
---
adding to that, having NPCs around will be a mess. 
---
to be honest I'd take them away and find another way to give the players end game content
---
Yep, Survival mode is still technically in Beta mode though.  The rumor/speculation is that once its launched fully in earnest its going to have ladder seasons where you'll have to start fresh at level 1.  Then once the season ends you'll get to move your characters to adventure mode and start over in the next survival ladder season.  You will probably be able to move them to adventure mode whenever you want, but won't be able to put them back afterwards.  That's what I'm hoping anyway.  That way we'll get open world PVP and a PVP battle royale game mode.
---
They are safe until they reach lvl5, then they got huge notification. If they die, they die.
---
And a stick of Dynamite. I'm actually a little surprised Dynamite didn't make it in the base game considering the region and mining influence.
---
Same, bought it a few months back and the only negative experience ive had was a player punching me while i tried selling stuff at whitesprings station. Had pacifist on so i guess he got more frustrated than i got angry.
---
Ark is also a bad example to use here, as it has a variety of communities.
---
Full-time ark official pvp players will never flood fo76 because the gameplay and daily routine is vastly different and, even as fo76 progresses, ark will still retain more value for a time sinking player. And thats mostly where the toxic playerbase for ark comes from.
---
If anything we should be worried about pve players, building enthusiasts or roleplayers.
---
Timezone?
---
Lol, shroud wouldnt give two fucks honestly, they will probably sponsor him to play it on release, and he probably wont play it ever again.. BRs are dying, single player games are making $ now
---
Let's be real, do Raiders ever give out free cookies ?
---
Hoping so.  That would make sense actually.  After all, it doesn't state "73 *new* perks".
---
‚ÄúWithout NPCs‚Äù you do realise NPCs are coming in the update right after yes?
---
I disabled DOF in my custom INI and it has helped a lot. It also makes underwater crystal clear, so that is cool.  If you do a search for "Custom INI" you should find some informative posts of people posting their tweaks.
---
My stock is basically serums and plans for half the game recommended price (other than event-based stuff which is still kinda rare so I sell that at full price), as well as a few quest-required items like crossbows in need of repair, chef hats, and swimsuits. Also any mods found during gameplay or items bulked get tossed into the machines until I next go to robot vendors. Most of my income comes from bulked stuff and plans, but the single best sellers in terms of turnover are outfit items - chef hats, tinfoil hats, spacesuits, that sort of thing. Whenever I sell one I go back to where they spawn and get a new one for the machine.
---
I‚Äôm in with whichever side lives at the crashed space shuttle settlement!
---
People got always excited when Bethesda is about to release something new. Bethesda knows how to build hype with nice videos. However people will always disappoint when get those releases to their hands, because reality is totally different. If you want to enjoy Bethesda products just don't ever buy or try them. Just dream about them and you are all fine. Bethesda products are all about dreaming, because reality doesn't meet with the hype they create.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure this is an FEV-related creature. There is no way in Hell that radiation could deform someone like this.
---
Then again, Wendigoes exist, so...
---
I was like that a month ago but ever since vendoring became a thing, I‚Äôve been making 5k a day just selling plans and legendaries.
---
I do a lot of events and grind for legendaries to flip. It‚Äôs a good business
---
Your parents must be real mean to you. Sorry you're so angry.
---
Surprise twist they can both live depending on the dialog used, food for thought.
---
Oh damb you must spend like crazy. I'm sitting at 6k right now thanks to the vending system
---
Is the Free Trial across all platforms? If so, when does it start?
---
Well yeah that's possible, it just doesn't feel right to have them again after they'll actually unleash hell in Nuclear Winter... maybe they can find another way to give us endgame content, who knows? 
---
We'll see!!
---
I don't want to agree because that's some genuine crazy dog people speak, but I do want more camp items so I'll take it. Lol
---
Touche'
---
I've been playing since the start and the answer is yes. Only the community is worth muchas more.
---
On PS4.
---
Today. All platforms for the next 7 days
---
1. Released as beta and needed more time. Rushed but New Vegas was borderline unplayable at release and it wasn‚Äôt even online. 
---
2. They promised cosmetic AND available in the game. Half truth. 
---
3. But they‚Äôve fixed a ton
---
4. It‚Äôs going to be ok. Don‚Äôt play it.
---
Three Dog is a beta, WE WANT MR NEW VEGAS
---
Pappododo im on rn
---
the only reason i play survival is to get those legendary weapons and then just scrap them for script. I have a new character that does about 4 out of the 5 challenges and then hop over to my main to finish it and sell it. otherwise, survival mode is just trying to run and hide from level 300s with TSE mini guns and shotguns who are jumping in the air like the hulk
---
There is an atom bundle right now
---
Thank you for the tips :)
---
Like i said, i'm looking forward to this update though it should've been there on launch. Having npcs in a fallout game shouldn't be something special
---
I'm on PS4. Went ps4 to play with a friend who quit like 2 weeks after launch.  Stayed ps4 cause the gf started playing and we now play together which is the only silver lining (admittedly an awesome one). I regret daily not having gone PC though.  From already having mods to better graphics to better controls and so on down the line.
---
Mt new Vegas is dope but that dont make the OG 3 dog beta.
---
Ill be on in about a hourish x
---
with a loud "TA DAAAAAAAAAAAAA!"  just my 2 cents
---
Yeah that definitely seems like something large groups of other people are not able to handle.
---
But us - the Vault Dwellers with no real experience prior to the vault opening? We truly are the only ones who can kill these damn bats.
---
I completely get what you mean I am a PVE player I don't do PVP much myself . 
---
I however do not believe you have to win to get the room, it is dependent on you rank. So like, if you get overseer rank 25 you get the armory room, once you get 50 you get the overseer room and so on
---
Juicehead kind of described it last night based from some leaks.
---
Sounds right, but what the characters just return to normal afterwards. Sounds kinda lame. I‚Äôm sure they have an idea of what they wanna do tho
---
Frankly I'd be more willing to try survival if legendary effects were removed, both from armor and weapons. I decided to try survival last night and got two-shotted by someone with an explosive semi-auto, while I was decked out in level 50 T-51 armor. I can appreciate the utility and coolness of it when fighting high-end creatures, but legendary drops are pure rng and some, like explosive guns, just make the game way too easy for those lucky enough to find them. Instead of needing skill and intuition to kill another player, you just need to buy an explosive gun.
---
We don't know anything concrete but maybe it's so that after you completed the main quest line you can access a new type of server which is pretty much Appalachia a year later.
---
Yeah I tried selling my plans. No one bought maybe I priced too high? Idk I try selling for 1/ to half the price the bot vendor asks for.
---
Totally, I‚Äôm hoping the ladder resets are true so the mode gets a little less crazy in the future.
---
Yea. To be honest the BR is optional and it's free. NPCs are literally coming out in the fall with 2 factions and new weapons and etc. Gonna assume OP didn't watch or read about everything coming out lol.
---
Could integrate a new one like into the current. Super good idea
---
He‚Äôs a beta *in comparison* to The raw Chad energy of Mr New Vegas. Three Dog is an alpha by his own right.
---
 I wonder if it will be a separate game mode in adventure.
---
Do you understand the story of the game at all?
---
And I think that‚Äôs ultimately a good thing, as it gives the writers some creative distance
---
New starters should come from the same area that the new NPCs are from (probably from the NW of the map).
---
Only the legacy players are from V76.
---
Bethesda could then add a suitcase or bin near V76  containing a V76 suite and a HoloTape that allows them to start the V76 Overseer quest line so the newbies do not miss out on anything.
---
The above probably will not happen, but would be quite a good way to get things rolling seemlessly
---
From what I saw/read you'll unlock a number of cosmetics (personal and CAMP I guess) plus you gain extra access to the new vault.
---
There's a mention of being able to explore the new vault and that based on your rank in the BR system you'll gain more access to it. So if you don't play the BR at all you'll have limited access.
---
From my understanding yes. They have new armors and weapons and workshop stuff, that can be carried over to adventure/survival
---
Or he could be one of the companions.
---
Like i said i'm not gonna play it anyway but that's not the problem. The problem is this game already has enough problems.
---
That's straight up Inception right there :P
---
The no option is pressing B and leaving...
---
I'm more of the mindset, let the new players get really, really annoyed and frustrated with the incomplete and bugged product, with all its glitched and uncompletable content, and mods that don't work, or are poorly identified, with quests that are hard to follow because the information is lacking, the RNG that is frustratingly un-benevolent, and ghouls that slither rather than run, and hit you for massive damage when they haven't even become visible yet.
---
Let them add their voices to ours in requesting that Bethesda fix some of the broken content to make the game a little better.
---
Maybe with more voices, and more submissions to Bethesda's fix-it dept, some of the things that have not worked since November, but have somehow gotten through 9.5 patches, updates, and server maintainences, will then get fixed quickly?
---
Just a thought, don't shoot me for thinking it.
---
Ive already been in one, i lost all my shit and died
---
The announced on twitter around 30 minutes before maintenance. Short notice.
---
I look for level 40- and team up with them. If they accept I fast travel and give them the package deal. The deal is 30 stimpacks and 1k and then I change servers.
---
Yeah I got that impression too, but don't you think it would be great if regardless of side you got hit by raider gangs in the world... Like it's other gangs or something
---
I will get on that after the server maintenance is done
---
there will be an atom pack once the servers are back up
---
The only difference between Survival and Adventure is the unrestricted PvP and the exp bonus in Survival. Sounds like Survival is the pvp-focused game mode to me.
---
Indeed, smart on Bethesda's part to leave little time to speculate on the new mode, and just give the world the chance to decide for themselves. Consider me stoke.
---
Thanks! I'll go check it's downloading now.
---
Do you understand the Fallout franchise at all?
---
Sounds better than when I had to listen to a dude having some "personal time" at The WhiteSprings. :(( worst random encounter of my life. I don't think he knew his mic was on.
---
no problem, happy to help. if you are worried about pvp and people pissing in your corn flakes just to ruin your day, dont be, just enter adventure mode. also they cannot destroy your base unless they are in pvp with you.
---
Probably stay that way till you kill them and have to wait maybe 30 mins for them to respawn. I assume they can be killable even when they are humans
---
Mine is closer to black bear lodge so i think I'm safe
---
Yeah, people bitching no matter what they do.
---
Scheduled maintenance and update hasn't started yet. But will soon. If you had looked in this sub, a few posts down from yours someone linked the details.
---
I didn‚Äôt even get a countdown timer. Just booted from server lol
---
1. They did make a finished game. Completing a scorch vaccine to get nukes and kill the SBQ was the end of it. If you had played and discovered the lore it would not come as a surprise that NPCs are coming after that.
---
2. Who cares you get tons more in game if you actually play
---
3. Most bugs are gone. A few persist
---
4. Again who cares. Especially if there are Adventure quests that tie into it.
---
You assume that development is an either or proposition. The people doing back end engine work to support a BR are not the same people doing art, quests and new levels.
---
It is possible to do both, and in fact they did both during Wild Appalachia.
---
Relax. Is just game why you heff to be mad?
---
They announced it. 30 mins ago. I know. Kinda close, but kinda expected it since they said it on e3 that they were putting in content later on.
---
I don‚Äôt think so. The whole point of the trailer was that Appalachia has changed, and people are now coming back. It‚Äôs much more likely that they‚Äôll integrate this new content into the already existing game.
---
Wasn‚Äôt being toxic, I voiced an opinion you don‚Äôt agree with, the two are different. If you dislike my opinion then that‚Äôs fair enough, but it‚Äôs still my opinion lol.
---
How does that matter? Do you think they first made the story and then made the decision to make it online and add no npcs? It's the other way around.
---
Yup I‚Äôve played every game excluding Brotherhood.
---
Bethesda could then add a suitcase or bin near V76 containing a V76 suite and a HoloTape that allows them to start the V76 Overseer quest line so the newbies do not miss out on anything.
---
go to bed todd
---
That‚Äôs a great idea
---
I think everything carrys over besides perks that are exclusive to the game mode. I could be wrong. Issue I'm having though is if the BR is just standard items and not marked as atom store, what's stopping people from getting max "Overseer" rank and giving away the PR skins or whatever else comes out. It won't really be exclusive rewards to that game mode for long.
---
Good.
---
I'm hoping it's a new mode like adventure and survival. So new players arrive in the old wasteland and then continue the story until finished and then when the story is complete the game tells you it's been a year and the wasteland is evolving
---
If that's true that is also really funny. Lucky you lol
---
The "Ring of Fire" cometh! :D
---
Please post pics and video!
---
and you guys let them get away with it again! oh don‚Äôt worry, they‚Äôll never do this again I swear. they won‚Äôt make another half complete game and finish it 6 months after release to the joy of the fanboys who are finally getting the product they deserved day 1. ridiculous
---
This is how the children of Atom started.
---
Do you have to go on Bethesda‚Äôs website for a key? Because it says it‚Äôs $30 on Xbox. Asking for a friend.
---
I didn‚Äôt pay 18 dollars for the color blue. I also didn‚Äôt buy some dumb side piece merchandise. You know how minuscule the amount of people that is? I‚Äôm condoning those prices and they‚Äôve had their backlash and we‚Äôve seen improvement. The topic at hand is battle royale. Stick to it
---
Everything I have read indicates it will be free on all platforms.
---
Wait a few mins, servers are down for maintenance, and everything will probably pop up in a few mins/hours
---

Is help from others super necessary? I‚Äôve never found fallout games to be particularly difficult, but keep hearing about newbies needing help.
---
Ditoüëç download begins
---
Bloodied builds are easy. Take all dmg  and AP perks for your weapon of choice (melee/rifle/heavy), add Nerd Rage, Serendipity, and Bloodied mess perks, Adrenal Reaction mutation, and the rest is dependant on how you want to play.
---
Nigh impossible to screw up.
---
I stopped min/maxing a while ago, and run a more utilitarian rifle build that isn't focused on CRITS, just base dmg.
---

Parachute out of a battle royal vertibird
---
No one said it wasn't your opinion. The two are very different, that's correct and I know what I said. "Lol"
---
You are never going to learn
---
I‚Äôd tell any new players to just take the game at their own pace, and not get caught up in trying to advance the main story or collect the best legendaries. I think 76 is at its best when you take the time to really explore the world and appreciate the smaller details.
---
OMG WHOLE NEW INTRO!!!!!
---
No, you can pretty much solo anything except a few quests. But in the beginning, when I didn‚Äôt know what I was doing, I met some great players who gave me weapons and food. I still appreciate it to this day!
---
find a good melee weapon as you will run out of ammo fast
---
The Battle Royale, think wastelanders drops in September?
---
Can‚Äôt wait to see you in Appalachia!
---
Thats what i mean. No company is paying him to watch the Microsoft conference or Bethesda conference. I cant believe how dumb that dude is
---
I'm gonna venture a guess and say year 1 and year 2 will be separate game modes
---
If I didn't care, why would I play it? It pains me to see a franchise so butchered and devoid of what made it great.
---
Wish I hadn‚Äôt paid full price for mine, it‚Äôs not even remotely the game I paid for anymore lol.
---
But that would mean all the new players have to sludge through the old content, and this update is clearly meant to attract people who were alienated by that old content. I think the integration will be seamless, but it means that new players will not be Vault 76 dwellers.
---
Ah gotcha, thanks! I‚Äôm very interested to see what the lone wolf experience is really like
---
How did they change it
---
It does not, but it's safe to assume that trying to cross the fire ring will kill you.
---
You could destroy whatever their stuck inside, but that‚Äôll give you a bounty
---
Perhaps.
---
I love the game, but the same stuff was said when Survival came out.
---
I don't play Survival, I prefer my Murder Hobo PvE only but they keep making new quests and content in general.
---
I mean, I'll give BR a try, much prefer PvP in a situation like that, but I'm just not as twitchy as I was when younger.
---
When I leave the game will my camp always be where I built it unlit Imove it?
---
I can absolutely appreciate you giving me the scoop.  It does appear there are a handful of individuals who see themselves as crusaders defending their broken product as some means of justifying their purchase and continued gaming enjoyment.  I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not the only one who is a conscientious consumer and can take a fair bit of criticism without losing my mind.  
---
I guess in the future I will refrain from posting here even if I purchase the game down the road.  I am curious, as someone who regrets the purchase - have the updates truly improved the game to where you think it‚Äôs going a direction of full redemption like No Mans Sky (arguably)?  Or is it hopeless?
---
Meanwhile I'm still banned. It's been 4 fucking months. Congrats on being able to make the game better. I tried and gave up.
---
Last time this happened to me, it was a mod that I had that was out dated.
---
They never have nearly as much stuff to show as most of the other companies. For them, I thought it was fine personally. But everyone is shitting on them because fallout battle royale as well as the numerous mobile games that were presented(even though one of them is on pc and the other just got announced for switch). I genuinely think it's just popular to hate Bethesda right now. Most of the people complaining about nuclear winter probably don't even fucking play fallout 76
---
Someone already posted, sorry about that
---
And hopefully the new combat mechanics are included in this update too
---
correct, it was a glitch that but was fixed. go figure lol
---
It‚Äôs not difficult and help isn‚Äôt really needed we just like giving people gifts I guess and feeling like we are coming to the rescue lol
---
Yeah, you can play it free for this week, then buy it if you like it
---
No, it‚Äôs not absolutely necessary but certainly helps.  This community is a very warm and welcoming one. So many players have just dropped in and gave me free stuff when I was new to the game. I know a lot of people are already helping new players when they meet one, I think we can show some generosity this week in particular to a flood of new players. It‚Äôll only help the game we all love.
---
Did they say that the area around the actual 51 door would be the battle zone. Most battle royale game have a map seperate from the waiting area. (I Haven't Watched the confrence yet
---
I thought that was great too, and really catches the spirit of most of the people who play this game. I've had a few minor run-ins with griefers since launch, but mostly it's been a great time.
---
Definitely don‚Äôt rush it but enjoy the ride. By that I mean, explore and enjoy the quests. It has become quite easy to just fast travel to a vendor around whitesprings, pick up a shitload a plans for dirt cheap and have the strength of a level 40 player at level 5. Don‚Äôt do this as you‚Äôll miss a lot of the fun of leveling up the normal way.
---
What platform are you on
---
That would be amaZing!
---
You can most definately do everything yourself.
---
 Most high levels will drop rad-x, radaway, or stimpacks (at least I do). All very helpful at low and mid-range levels.
---
just curious - out of those 100 at least one was usable or all just scrips?
---
We are actually talking about setting up a recruitment station down by the overseer's camp for our clan. 
---
"Come on in. Have some purified water and a bowl of corn soup. While I have you hear have you heard the benefits of joining Fever Clan?"
---
Wow pretty amazing. Thanks for sharing.
---
welcome back
---
PC doesn't have yet, it just went under maintenance.
---
I'll take anything at this point. I love every song we currently have but I could go for some variety.
---
Drops in sometime in ‚Äúfall‚Äù at least.
---
I'm more annoyed about the line 'What gives?'.
---
If it's as stupidly annoying to get stuff done as finding the bloody camera is then I will say some rude words.
---
They fucked up. The Spotify version cuts out at 1:54.
---
No update yet on PS4 at least, looks like XBOX has theirs.
---
This helped so much, thanks for  posting!
---
I am willing to help any new players On xbox I will be unlocking my water purifiers and i will be dropping items for all low levels near the overseer camp.
---
I was pretty much a lone wolf until level 50 or so. After that, I started to meet other players and actually talk to them, and I‚Äôve made some great friends that way.
---
games take like 20 minutes..
---
you think they are taking the scorched away? but the scorchbeast was even in the trailer for nuclear winter.
---
idk i think that ppl are coming back to appalachia because we got the situation under control, not because we eliminated the scorched and the queen, but because we know how to deal with them
---
I asked a question... "who asked for BR" and YOUR answer was "the community"... Did you forget what you posted? Did you forget why I even chimed in?
---
You answered my question by answering "the community". It was at that moment you decided to speak for "the community" and declare the desires as a whole. I simply disputed that and now you are back peddling. YOU SIR ARE THE ONE SPEAKING FOR THE MASSES!
---
Also, I wonder how long you have been playing Fallout games and how well do you know the community. Why do you think survival mode is a flop? It's not what the majority of the Fallout community wants, that's why. Strict PVP is not a desire for most Fallout players... In fact, I would bet that most Fallout players want to escape the frag fest nature of strict PVP shooters and that is why they picked up Fallout in the first place.
---
If you want to claim that BGS is trying to lure in new players that enjoy strict PVP shooter type games, then touche'... but that is a FAR CRY from claiming that the BR mode in 76 is there to appease the majority of longtime Fallout fans.
---
Here is a post for you to chew on...  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/byreuc/fallout\_battle\_royale\_is\_now\_a\_reality/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/byreuc/fallout_battle_royale_is_now_a_reality/)
---
It also looks like he might be wearing Tesla X-01.
---
Thank you for the heads up, time to get the download on the road.
---
You know damn well micro-transactions ARE a cash cow - even if all they offer is cosmetic.  The entire point of BR for games not initially designed for them is to produce a massive, reliable revenue stream.  And I would care less about all the fools who waste their money on that junk if it weren‚Äôt the probability that dedication of design resources to BR probably took away from the main game development
---
I‚Äôll definitely help out new players, I just hope this game will keep its mature and friendly character. Not really looking forward to a flood of 12 year old Fortnite players.
---
I didn‚Äôt think of the skins. What we need is something that makes all of our favorites ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù to everything and everybody except us when we look in our pipboy. Something beyond the favorites wheel. So our favs will not show up at vendors, in the legendary scrapper (always paranoid about that one), and to other players during trading.
---
Wonder which update will transform the Whitesprings into a ruined, radioactive hell hole.
---
Save most ammo you find (you can toss away missiles and .38 thought). Down the line, your gonna find/trade for a sweet legendary weapon, and having a surplus of extra ammo for it will be nice. (Your gonna chew through your ammo to take down end game bosses and events)
---
I need to Mr. New Vegas to make me feel sexy again.
---
That's a hell of a way for someone to have their first wasteland experience.
---
Give automatrons !üëèüëèüëè
---
Holy shit this is an really amazing idea
---
Why pay for decent writers when 90% of your playerbase only wants to shoot stuff.
---
I don't have a lot of experience with BR, but it will probably work like they all do. You wait in a Lonny til you get a full lobby, the game lasts however long it lasts (I think they said 20 mins).
---
If you log out you're forfeiting.
---
I bet he encountered the naked scorch bug.
---
I've been thinking this for a while. The introduction should have been given a small change ages ago. Instead of oversleeping for a year, the vault was releasing people in small groups so that they didn't all fight over the small number of resources outside the vault.
---
I‚Äôm with you 100%. I‚Äôm posted something similar on FB. I figure the more we expand the player base, the more time and resources Beth will put into 76.
---
It's like Super Mutants and their treats. I always fall for it.
---
I've been running up to all the fresh people out of the vault and giving people a nice little upgraded baseball bat + outfit + foods + water &lt;3 it's been a lot of fun!
---
Noted xD
---
RedEye was the perfect host for Raider Radio. I'd absolutely love for another host in his style if they establish another raider station. My only complaint with RedEye was he had like two stories and it got old hearing them for the 20th time.
---
Of course.
---
If you want more cookies it'll cost you though.
---
There is, buy 1000, and get +500 and a limited time jacket.
---
Lol, not related to this game in any shape or form, but I used to run a server on Ark survival evolved, and towards the end of my servers life (ran about a year or so) I got bored and basically removed all the rules and gave a bunch of new tribes a bunch of high-end gear and rockets and told then to go ham, but they ended up trying to follow me to any other server I played asking for stuff constantly.
---
It‚Äôs funny how you and like 20 others on this Reddit desperately do all you can to defend against criticism of the game.... when literally the rest of the gaming community is shaking it‚Äôs head.  
---
Enjoy your game shell I guess... or was that shell of a game?
---
THE NOOKIE !!!
---
Just to be clear. The story of 76 is literally everyone died due to becoming a feral ghoul, turning to a normal ghoul and feeling the people who wanted to kill them or dying for he scorched and the plague. Literally everyone died but the people in the vaults. Now that either A) we have the cure that the player made or B) defeated the scorched and the plague. People can actually return and not die allllll over again.
---
As a PvP player who almost exclusively uses VATS, this was the right decision 100%. This will put everyone on an even playing field, and won't instantly turn off new players because seasoned players are deleting them from existence. 
---
I think this game mode may even run better than adventure mode I'm terms of server stability. There is less gear taxing the server, less item spawns (possibly the removal of junk spawns from the world) no stashes or vending machines, less NPC spawns etc.
---
Can't wait to try it out today.
---
Several. 3 rifleman cards, tank, killer, bloody mess, gun foo, adrenalin, a couple others I can't remember name atm. Weapon is 2 shot explosive primed gauss rifle.
---
Sooo tempted
---
Well mister misses mister missy miss miss miss! Guess I just suck balls at communicating my thoughts!
---
Exactly buddy!!
---
I don't know for 100% sure but I am close to certain you will need PS+. The game is down for maintenance now. I imagine the trial will start when it comes back up in a couple hours.
---
OP said they didn't get an alert.
---
well since other cosmetic stuff is for all your characters this one should be too. aren't the atomic shop repair kits usable by all your characters?
---
QUICK! Don‚Äôt say anything bad. You‚Äôll get downvoted to oblivion. Smile and wave boys, smile and wave :D
---
That sounds interesting tbh. I haven't played since December but I'm playing through all the fallouts and just play this on the side with personal hardcore restrictions. Might really enjoy I think! But won't play to win
---
Yes, it's an online game that requires ps+.
---
I'm not sure about the free trial version, but they did release the beta as a separate version on the store.
---
I have played the crap out of FO76 but I will never stop saying that it could be made SO MICH BETTER WITH NPCs! They really were an integral part of what drew me into the storylines and the gameplay of every other fallout game and made me enough a fan of the series to play 76 in the first place. If this one came out alone I highly doubt I‚Äôd still be playing
---
Yeah or maybe they should just add the sex to the plan so at least you know you will be walking around in female clothes haha.
---
I say sucks to be them for missing out. Lol
---
But really it will be interesting how everything plays out.
---
Nukashine is great -- how else are you going to end up at top of the world at level 6?
---
He gets paid to play newest battle royale. They make the deals months before relase (he even teased games several times).
---
I‚Äôm exited. I always thought battle royale would work well with fallout 76
---
In adventure mode you no longer take damage when getting shot at by another player unless you shoot back
---
K
---
I dont think it has went live yet.
---
Right... or accidentally shoot someone first and they light you up. I know that still happens because one of my random teammates thought it was funny to kill a low level guy in a nuke zone that accidentally tagged him
---
Anger! Outrage!! Pitchforks!
---
But I want it now!
---
If everybody is a good boy/girl, is anybody really a good boy/girl?
---
How long is maintenance?
---
I worked myself up to lvl 345 solo. So its a nice challenge without someone babysitting you imo
---
i absolutely HATE playing battle royals, i am way to bad at FPS and will get absolutely demolished.... but i'll give it a go and try to reserve judgement for after i give it a few tries.   the trailer does look pretty fun.
---
I kind of like the emptiness.  It gives the world a different flavor from the other Fallouts, especially when you are low-leveled.  But I'm not going to say no to human NPCs.  I do think that Wastelanders will probably be a great deal more conservative than some believe, though.  I get the feeling it's going to be like answering to the NPCs at settlements in Fallout 4, to go rescue this or kill that.
---
When's it available?
---
I am hoping after the maintenance is over, idk how long that usually takes though being new here.
---
You knew it's coming today, be happy it's finally there instead of complaining.
---
Lmao ok so in order for me to be an informed consumer before a purchase, I should purchase the product and then let the developer know how I feel about my purchase?  And ‚ÄúI‚Äù am the sheep?  God you‚Äôre dense
---
What makes you think this is all the variety? Fallout 4 didn't have charisma checks. Also not every conversation in fallout 1,2,3, NV and tactics had more than 4 options. Also what makes you think that each of these options equals to what you say. The "do you think I'm a charity" could lead to more options or reject the quest ect. Seriously dude you are trying to start hate on something you know nothing about yet? What's the point?
---
I‚Äôd say two hours but not too sure. Two hours was roughly how long last maintenance was
---
I‚Äôm on pc!
---
Yeah well Most of the time people are forgiving fallout 76 has a nice community but I understand what you mean.Sorry I thought you were referring to the damage thing.
---
Unfortunately it was "fixed", same with melee damage gain when over-repaired :(
---
The Cult of Woobie must be a new faction
---
Uhh i dont think so.
---
I believe this subreddit is like YELP for fo76.
---
No one put a bad review :S
---
**Update - 10:00 a.m.¬†EDT:**¬†
---
We've now brought Fallout 76 offline across all platforms in order to perform maintenance and apply¬†updates. We don't currently have an end-time to share for downtime today, but we will keep you updated in this thread as maintenance progresses.¬†
---
Thank you very much!
---
I can spend around $10 on lunch some days, so I'm considering just skipping lunch next time I'm out and buying this instead. I'd certainly get around the same level of enjoyment tbh.
---
I bet he's got some incredible drops from WS glowing ones in the past, thus the glorious dedication üëç
---
And that's the reason people will start thinking the community is shit
---
That line of thought sorta breaks the entire thing doesn't it.  NPCs: Hey lets move to that part of the US where they are continuously nuking each other.
---
Anyone play Elite DANGEROUS? They have a few podcasts that are broadcast in game as radio an addition to having an RSS feed. it is really cool to warp to the system they broadcast in and listen locally.  
---
[Lave radio](https://laveradio.com/)
---
Usually a timer pops up in game but not this time. Oh well, good things to come!
---
Most likely once the servers are back online.
---
Fair enough, but why release it like that? Do more internal testing, maybe an opt-in open beta. Slapping a "pre beta" label on it isnt going to keep people from treating it like a finished product. Especially when they're launching it with a free week, which is when the game really needs to shine and convince folks its worth playing.
---
Awwwww.. did my opinion upset you. üòÇü§£
---
Why, why is that everytime i'm criticizing a game all i get are comments like " don't play it" or "stop whining". I care about this game otherwise i wouldn't write this. I hate battle royale but i like the game. No matter what i say, even though the criticism is deserved people will always hate on it. But criticism is important. If we just keep our mouths shut, things will get worse and worse. I like this community but it's as sensitive and blind towards criticism as any other. No matter the arguments no matter what happens people will hate anybody who doesn't say the game is perfect. And that's what actually pisses me off. I understand Bethesda. Why get rid of the bugs before launch when people will buy it anyway? I mean i'd do the same. After it's all about money. I'm not angry at Bethesda. I'm angry about the people like you who defend the game no matter what happens. You think you're helping the game but all you're doing is holding it back, stopping it from being what it could be. Think about that.
---
I doubt they will, but you never know
---
How do you know where the finish area is?
---
My understanding is we are only getting two factions, settlers and raiders. Which kinda sucks.
---
Thank you for this.  Silence the asshats
---
If they didn't want you to have it they would have locked their purifiers.
---
Ditto, hope to get the download started at the very least. None yet on PS4.
---
If your brand new to a fallout title then I would say follow the storyline as its enriching and a fun experience. If this is not your first rodeo then basically ignore anything that seems like a main quest and just start slaughtering everything you can until lvl 50. Then your basically ready to tackle the main and side story lines and get the best loot.
---
Almost certainly not but you may be able to get them mid match. The frog legs perk suggests maybe not but we will see
---
I hate big streamers and content creators as much as the next guy here, but if he plays nuclear winter (please god let it be stable and good) and his hundreds of thousands of viewers see a fun experience, I can't see how it would be bad for the game.
---
This is sad but true
---
2.35 for PC
---
yeah the improved ones are character specific but i think the others may not be. sure, but I don't think you need to worry about the coat, every cosmetics i bought on the atom shop i can use in every character. even my lv 2 is wearing a tuxedo
---
After they update it today
---
Yeah, there‚Äôs Adventure mode (PvP free for 99% of the time), Survival mode (for PvP players) and the new Battle Royale mode, which will be PvP as well. However, BR won‚Äôt be the main game based on everything I‚Äôve read‚Äîsounds like it‚Äôll be a much more condescend map.
---
imo its one of the best looking clothing yet and I might buy it, since I can't fucking complete my Imposter Sheepsquatch set I want to wear so much. (For real though, why is the Imposter Sheepsquatch Helmet so rare?)
---
There are plans to make lemonaid.
---
I'm wildly speculating üòÅ because it's fun to speculate! Nuclear winter should take place after we.nuked the hell out of appalachia and we unleashed the ring of fire, so technically we're still in phase 1 of the story (well let's say 1.5)
---
Lmao mood. I got told this exact same thing on twitter too :p
---
I don't think mutations carry over. From my understanding it is only carrying character appearance and camp.
---
That's what's so frustrating about it. In reality, it could be a really cool addition. But it's trendy to bash battle royale games because battle royale is so trendy right now and fortnite=cringe.If but for that, people probably wouldn't be hating on it so much. And that is despite the fact that it's just one mode. If the game was just that, then there would probably be a more legitimate reason to be frustrated imo
---
That's exactly what worries me.
---
That‚Äôs a great dlc title!
---
Same stats, I have a full set of +1 CHR armor and found a player vendor selling shielded casual armor to boost my charisma (12 CHR) for when buying and selling at robot vendors. It's nice that i'll have another purpose for it now.
---
Agreed, way too many PVP dev bucks being spent when we don't even have a decent PVE endgame yet
---
I was talking about the battle royale not the game itself.
---
Ya that or build this for us, but I‚Äôm hoping some of them will be like let‚Äôs explore this and bring so unique dialogue to certain areas
---
The part of the map that isn't on fire
---
Well this is an opt in open beta, it's totally not mandatory...
---
What's going on with it? I'm on the exact spot as the pic shows, but Rainbow Six Siege is advertised instead.
---
Anyone can give some up-to-date tips for the new players? What is worth stressing about and what isn't, priorities in loot, not obvious mechanics etc.
---
Nope.

SP - Your posting becomes more cringeworthy as more people come out with logical points.  I‚Äôm all the more glad for my non purchase because of your comments - and I‚Äôm totally sold on never buying and telling my friends the same thanks to the few redditors here.
---
How are we supposed to not use cats when there is an aiming bug (at least for me) where I every time I try to aim my weapon it sights in for like a second than goes out keeps happening. Guess I‚Äôm SOL.
---
&gt; Is it normal to be low on wood, food and water almost constantly?
---
It's not really normal to be low on wood -- just collect from every single log and woodpile you see.  Once you're not low on wood you should never be low on water, just collect loads of dirty water and boil it.
---
It's Battle Royale.. They are match making matches.. That can last up to 30, 40 minutes.. Once you die, you are out and can leave or spectate.. You don't enter late in Battle Royale. 52 people are put in a match making lobby.
---
ooh
---
Didnt it? So what were those yellow-red dialog options where the game would just give you more caps?
---
Are you really going to close your eyes that badly? Its a conversation ripped straight up from fo4, just like the rest of the game. If it looks that way, it most probably is. The point is voicing that this is a bad thing.
---
12 inches
---
I can't wait for it to arrive!
---
Thanks for the heads up, Ps4 didn‚Äôt see it yet but manually looking for an update worked.
---
It's 10$, I'm willing to support the new content.
---
Here you go, all the info you need is right here https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app
---
Maybe it'll be as simple as NPCs out in the open in the forest, and in indoors maps/geared up if outside
---
Gah, that's so weird when that happens. And they slide so damn fast!
---
oh sure well speculate all you want, i just got scared about my nukes and thought you maybe knew something I didn't. i was gonna start nuking everything!!
---
 **PS4 update available. 5.394 GB**
---
In his defence those bloated glowing ones start looking thicc after you‚Äôve been outside of the vault for a few months
---
you will need a ps4 account. you should not req a ps4+ subs.
---
I have no + subs, and been playing since nov.
---
Gonna be hell, got used to marsupial and speed demon. 
---
Still gonna be fun.
---
Are you stuck in a rut?  Drink NukaShine and discover whole new vistas.
---
It will not have any DR or SPECIAL bonus
---
But his stories are the REAL DEAL man
---
You do realize that every fallout tree ever has been like that right? It‚Äôs always ‚Äúget more info‚Äù, ‚Äúevil answer‚Äù, ‚Äúgood answer‚Äù, and then insert any number of witty remakes that don‚Äôt do anything. It‚Äôs been like that sense the beginning
---
ahah you got that right :P
---
Ok bye then
---
Ahahah no no it's speculation time, don't worry your nukes are safe, cuddle them all you want
---
Gotcha
---
Is it out yet?
---
Now that's not a bad idea. I want to see my stock outside the game.
---
Looks like they fixed a bug in the last patch, now two-shot explosive weapons such as Fatman and rpg show twice the damage instead of 1.01x. I wonder if the damage output also got a boost.
---
Stay away from the nukashine fellow vault dweller
---
Giggidy Giggidy
---
It's not specifically said anywhere in the official article that mutations aren't brought along, but that Frogs Legs perk was the main reason I suspected they won't be :)
---
I believe they said you could squad up, but aren‚Äôt forced to. You‚Äôll just potentially be playing against squads of four if you go solo.
---
I never understood whats the obsession with 4 dialog choices. Some conversations don't require that many options, and others do require more.
---
I dont understand why would they shoot themselves in the foot with that limitation.
---
Good point. I'm guessing it will be up after the update. Here is a maintenance forum to know when it's ready: https://bethesda.net/community/topic/347521/fallout-76-maintenance-june-10-2019?language%5B%5D=en
---
much appreciated. Silly question, how are the camps handled? Do you phase into them like WoW (because someone could build in same spot)?
---
Have you tried crying about it?
---
"i'm down!! Help!!!...oh sweet help - great thank...woah hey wait noooooooaaaargh..."*
---
**...Burp...**
---
the power armour station is the only one not to be found by just general play.
---
'miner miracles' must be completed for that. (you were going to ask).
---
Ive had no response since late February.
---
Hell ya! Time to kill bad guys and rebuild America!
---
At this point spend the $17 and get a new login. All that stuff you had is about to be meaningless trash anyway.
---
Glowing humans NPC‚Äôs? lol
---
This had me rolling.  These frequent redditors here must have sad lives.  The game is so good they spend all their free time notnplaying and defending how good it is
---
BUt iM roLE PlaYiNg A RaIdEr brAH..
---
Go back to the Vault 76 area and melee the fuck out of everything. You‚Äôll be able to kill the weak enemies near the Vault pretty easily and be able to stock up on ammo and health
---
Not really. I just don't pick much stuff up. I mine copper and acid, and sell that when I need money.
---
Not super jazzed about NW but I'm still gonna give it a try to see what it's like. Battle Royale ain't my thing in general, just curious to see their take on it. Maybe I'm wrong about it. It's happened once or twice before.
---
Wastelanders? Lawd Jesus I am hyped for every single part of that.
---
Shh, it goes against their narrative.
---
They can just log out and join a different server
---
&gt;  Might really enjoy I think! But won't play to win
---
Same. The way I took it is that you'll earn progression towards the Overseer rewards even if you don't win. Even then, I feel like getting first place still might be a lot easier than other BRs.
---
It was a new type of game for them. To assume it wouldn‚Äôt have issues for a while is naive. After last years E3 I wasn‚Äôt going to play. I don‚Äôt play online games. I got the game as a Christmas present and figured ok why not. Ended up loving the game. My experience has been good with the game. I‚Äôm not going to stop playing a game in my favorite franchise because of bugs. Hell when I played NV I had to start about five new characters 3/4 of the way into the main quest because of bugs. The reason I defend the game is because I love fallout. I love this game. I don‚Äôt care if they have bugs. I don‚Äôt care if they release SOME content I don‚Äôt like. I‚Äôve got my money‚Äôs worth out of every Bethesda title. Always. If I stop having fun I put it down.
---
People that say they like the cover better than John Denver's original are wrong.
---
I hope not, because I love trading
---
After my ban I bought a fresh account. Its up to 820 hours. I really like fallout. Couldn't really care for Bethesda though.
---
There are a couple plans in the power armor Bay at Garrahan mining headquarters, where you get excavator armor
---
How do you know they're still there without going in yourself?
---
Yeah that‚Äôs how it works. It may be random as to where it specifically ends up but yes the circle simply gets smaller and smaller forcing players into tighter areas so people are dying and moving etc. at some point the ring is so small someone will be the last standing.
---
Giggity.
---
I pretty much bet it‚Äôll be up in 1 1/2 hours or 2 1/3 hours because that‚Äôs the normal times its never lower them 2 hours
---
You are a sad sad little person Pudding.
---
I wonder if they would assign you a random squad for even teams
---
Don't know why you got downvotes just for speaking the truth.
---
The game funnels you in the beginning to places with quests. Once you have the basic plans, you should build a camp near where you‚Äôll explore so you can get food, water and sleep to regain your health. Try starting the play session with some xp boosts like sleeping to get Well Rested perk, playing music to gain Well Tuned, once you learn how to make cranberry cobblers, eat those to boost your xp gain. There‚Äôs a lot to explore. I know many people like to take their time and enjoy finding all the little stories, secrets and loot littered in the beginning areas. The main quest line is worth doing as you‚Äôll get rewards in weapons, armor, outfits and plans.
---
 **XBOX update available.** **4.68gb**
---
Maybe Vault 76 releases Wave 2?
---
Perhaps we were just the ones on the top level or in the main section. There could be another locked off section or even a deeper part of the vault that begins releasing after a set amount of time having allowed the first group time to explore and begin rebuilding. That would allow time to see if the first group survives, give them a chance to deal with hostile creatures lay the groundwork etc. before the second wave comes out to help pick up the pieces from the first wave.
---
Discord advantage will be huge.
---
Awesome, thanks a lot for your replies. I am stocked to play tonight.
---
Oh god yes
---
Those fat glowing ones were very Fatman-resistant. Normal ghouls should be a lot easier to kill, unless the challenge is killing them in nuked zone.
---
For the longest time I thought it was supposed to be a cat.
---
I've cried about a lot of things in the recent past. This is not even close to how those incidents felt. Grow up.
---
Hey man don‚Äôt project on me lmao
---
Patch Notes Are Up
---
[LINK](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/347559/nuclear-winter-patch-notes-june-10-2019?language%5B%5D=en)
---
yes, it's annoying
---
&gt;Tbh, I was really against the community driving for a roadmap from Bethesda for this very same reason.
---
I'd say that the roadmap had been in place for quite some time prior to launch. That would be typical for any large, multi-phase, software drop. We do it all the time for projects a lot smaller than FO76! I'd guess that it took a bit to release it to the community because they had to get approval from on high to release it and also to "sanitize " so no information got released that they were keeping quiet.
---
Why are you telling me this?
---
The only reservation I have about the game mode is performance. 
---
I love the game but sometimes it feels like its held together by duct tape. 
---
Adds to the charm I guess lol
---
Shoot I‚Äôm lvl72 and I‚Äôll take the lead ore
---
Patch is 2.35 GB for PC. Hopefully PC version is correct this time.
---
Thank you. This is nice to know.
---
Sorry, what did you say?  Couldn't hear you over the sound of my plasma rifle reducing you to green goo.
---
üòÇ
---
Are y‚Äôall going to be wearing the same outfits? Like matchy matchy? 
---
Pretty sure it‚Äôs RNG and they know everyone wants it so one incident probably won‚Äôt effect it anyways.
---
also at the top of annoyances for me, so we have to get beth fix it
---
Most likely there was something about bringing in your Camp or something like that I didn't excatly understand that part
---
Oh thats cold lol
---
You're not my real mom!
---
Gary!!!!
---
If you have a lot of junk (base supplies) people will buy it giving you more caps. You can then also look at other players' vendors on the map, it shows who is selling Stimpaks.
---
The trial period I don‚Äôt expect nuclear winter to fully release until July
---
I believe your missing the heavy/weighted staff. I would consider it pretty rare i have all the staff plans shown plus the clubs but neither in the heavy/weighted mod.
---
Same. I doubt it's going to be "Winner only", but if it is, that just nukes the whole idea.
---
Don't know why, mine say 5.11 GB.
---
Also, it would not show up until i decided to restart the xbox.
---
I hope the language bug is fixed.
---
This is so fucking asinine I don‚Äôt know where to begin.  I‚Äôve said it in countless replies the point about BR was that it illustrates developer priorities and that is what is concerning.  
---
You idiots have to deface an argument in order to shore up an opinion that this game is worth playing.  Sad
---
Have you tried it against the queen yet? The 3 times I've used it  I did not see a great deal of difference on how quickly she took me out compared to the faster swing speed Deathclaw I am using. Is there a timing thing to blocking I'm missing?
---
They said that even stuff like modding and private servers would have to wait till late 2019 at the earliest.
---
4 charisma?  You're like a god.  I only have 3, I can swap cards when I want to jump.
---
I've seen some truly inspirational players in this game üí™
---
You win
---
PRE BUILT BUNKERS WOT
---
Actually though, yes
---
God damn you.... XD
---
Dude im on xbox I just need to hurry up and get to level 100 mind if i play with you? My Gt is Talal8812
---
You will not be able to bring any gear other than cosmetics over to NW
---
Wait can you actually kill people in open world in Fallout 76?
---
I heard that game kinda restricts PVP on some stupid way that you can't dmg any1 unless they fight back.
---
January through December is straight pride year
---
Thanks, was waiting for it.
---
Are you playing right now? Is it open yet?
---
Robo-brain Jean Ritchie, anyone?
---
Now that you mention the mistress. I think it would be really cool if sometime in the future they brought that faction back to life.
---
&gt;I get off to Todd lying on my face
---
Yeah I‚Äôve got both of those now. Just haven‚Äôt updated the video
---
Well you didn't bore me the bit, good sir! That was a darn good story right there. Thank you, and thank Bethesda, for all effort making Fo76 better
---
Could possibly be up after maintenance.
---
Servers are down now though so maybe the download will open once its done, unfortunately they do not have an estimated time of when the servers will be up.
---
If not it will be hard to fight squads
---
2.35 GB download.. servers is still down
---
Just adding to what the other two said, note that you have to run power to a vending maching for your camp to show up on the map, but not to sell things. I built a switch into mine for when I want to revise my camp and don't want any surprise visitors looking for goods.
---
They‚Äôve said so many times this isn‚Äôt trying to be another classic fallout it‚Äôs its own thing
---
this list is so vague, it doesn't really say anything. Also it mentions "lol just go look at the roadmap" why not link to it then so I can? I tried googling fallout 76 roadmap but all I can find is what they plan to add later, not what's changed now.
---
You can place your camp wherever (except spots that are marked locations or are reserved for future content). Placing your camp reserves it for you.
---
It will be there every time you log in. There is a Mapalachia project that maintains a map with locations, random spawns and resources. You can find it on this Reddit here.
---
Take some workshops in the forest when you get a bit geared up and some food. It will give you plans that you can read to be able to build in your base.
---
when is maintenance going to be done?
---
I'm guessing that the main strongholds will be un-nukeable, like vault 76
---
Might be an unpopular one, but honestly, I'd love to see Rose as a radio host. Sure, she's a raider and all that stuff, but she has the best location to see everything all over Appalachia from the Top of the World building. Location wise, it'd make enough sense for me.
---
There's your answer man, as Vera said in dead money, "begin again".
---
They haven't announced the promo yet
---
Refreshingly cold ahhhhh
---
Agreed that the skill checks and dialog options will be better than most MMOs, I didn't consider the dialog options when writing my comment. Thanks for a good catch!
---
Where is Free Trial ?
---
definitely isn‚Äôt on pc yet
---
Ada with the Mr Gutsy Hover Drive was so much awesome ;)
---
I hope there will be an option to put into a squad with random players or to play a version where there's no squads allowed at all. Otherwise the entire mode will be biased in favor of pre-made teams from places like Discord and solo players will have a very, very rough time.
---
What system are you on?
---
okay, thank you!
---
So i did this, and could craft the stations at the workshop but i still don't have them at camp. Ill try again after patch. Thank you
---
Thats why im asking. My assumption is I was a special case for causing a huge amount of negative PR. So im wondering if anyone else got access back, or if we're all just plain fucked without any word.
---
bring back cowboy and grunt as auxillary perks
---
Nope. Wouldn't give it back. Would allow everything else to go back and forth, but not that particular weapon. I felt so wronged, lol. I did find and buy one later that wk in a vending machine for 5k. But it wasn't ffr. Now I make myself go super slow when scrapping for scrip. The worst part is (and I don't want to sound like a whiner, but probably do lol), for whatever reason on that day the gm decided to keep unfavoriting my stuff. I did not notice this until after this lovely event happened though. Ugh! Just one of the many warts that we accept because we enjoy this gm I guess. Almost thought this Saturday that it was going to screw me over again, but on a MUCH larger scale. . . Logged in Saturday morning, and noticed my camp icon was not showing my shop. So I figured, well the switch must've been turned off by some salty shopper? Nope. All 4 of my FULLY STOCKED machines were at 0/0 . Talk about a PitA. Luckily (almost) everything was transferred to my stash, minus the 20 some serums that vanished into thin air. That was a fun hour and a half I'll never get back restocking/re pricing over 120 items. 76! You're damn lucky I love you, lol.
---
Oh okay.. haha. 
---
Thanks for being patient with me üòÜüòÇ
---
Me too
---
I didn‚Äôt enjoy fallout 4‚Äôs dialogue system (few really did) but this clearly just isn‚Äôt a game made for people like you and *even then* here they come with human npc‚Äôs trying to add choice and consequence into a game where there are multiple people that need to be accounted for. This is them course correcting to make people like you happier. They can‚Äôt just snap their fingers. If you just flat out think the dialogue is bad then just wait for the next game or drop the series. Nothing more can be done
---
I am sure that could be a possibility. I think it would be awesome if there were chances for rad storms inside the circle as well
---
Might finally give this a try.
---
Please Note: If you currently use any mods or custom game files, you will be unable to join Nuclear Winter matches until they are removed. This has been done to prevent mods and custom files from providing a competitive advantage.
---
Fuck, I can understand that, but that's going to be annoying. Text chat, Perk Loadouts and BetterInventory has made that game so much better for me. Oh well.
---
PC. Farmed up some stuff yesterday night, grabbed all my spare junk from my old and now underused mule, and got plenty of stuff now.
---
There's no way to get it until the game comes back online.  Then you buy the E3 pack of Atoms in the Atomic Shop from in-game.
---
Now thats what I call a patch!!
---
I go left running out the clubhouse, (not toward the cars... and sometimes back down the stairs. If people are high they‚Äôll run right after me then jump down behind them. 
---
Same goes for the smaller buildings and you can pull them to the rear of houses so players won‚Äôt shoot cars. 
---
It works pretty well however there‚Äôs always 1-2 players that hit cars a dozen times because it‚Äôs ‚Äúcool‚Äù and ghouls go flying or just disappear....
---
I guess it really depends on how the dlc is implemented. Let's say for example the version of the wasteland with NPCs is a new instance, then as you transition into it, maybe a disclaimer pops up warning you of the changes to certain SPECIAL s, at this point you have 1 chance to respec. That I can certainly live with
---
Sounds good, however I have to ask, will the Alien Blaster be revised?
---
It's supposed to be the most powerful energy pistol lorewise, yet here it's the worst if using fusion cells, and mediocre with alien ammo which is super rare.
---
Exacto mondo
---
Looking good. Nice work from the team so far.
---
"For karma" in a subreddit where any naysay about fo76 gets you massively downvoted. Yes, gaining karma was clearly my intention.
---
Sure, it isn't out yet. But the choices shown are clearly the same as in FO4. As in, no choices, not even roleplay friendly ones.
---
I'll be glad to be proven wrong tho.
---
Come to me my children, I shall feed you from my hand!
---
Aaaaaaaaaaah. Cool. Thanks!!
---
I never thought of that. Oh God no! I'll be tripping over everything.
---
Pray really hard.  That's the way games are acquired nowadays.  We've moved beyond downloads.  It's all prayer-based.
---
I could be wrong but I haven't seen them post it anywhere
---
I have been on it for 5 weeks and I'm begining to believe being in ketosis is extremely normal.  But also being out of it is normal.  I think the human body is supposed to regularly dip in and out of ketosis depending on food availability.  We just have SO much food and carbs we never ever need to switch..which I believe is not good.  There is alot of health benefits to being in ketosis that arent just for diabetics and much of the science is proving that it's a the preferred metabolic path that many organs like including the brain.  Also if you ate veggies all day you would be in ketosis so again there are very healthy ways to do it.  
---
Your 100% correct eating high dairy high high protein high high fats..bacon, McDonalds, all that shit all day long isnt good Haha.  But having both is just the best of both worlds
---
Its a promo where by buying $10 worth of atoms you get it along with the atoms and an extra 500
---
Thanks so much!
---
And the release notes were just put out. Guess what, it does integrity checks for ANY alterations or mods installed, if found it won't allow you into the new mode. So your entire argument just fell by the wayside
---
You got a point.  Fo games aren't perfect but they are still enjoyable, fo76 included.  It's just so discouraging when I spend an hour or more prepping to launch a nuke just to crash when it comes time to read the rewards.
---
ABSOLUTLY right. Had they not OPENED with the announcement of Wastelanders, I am sure Kotaku would be hammering out the angry articles already.
---
Any estimate on when we‚Äôll hear about the other updates coming soon for Nuclear Winter? Like the roadmap we got with Wild Appalachia?
---
I'm not saying that they didn't have one. Of course they did, you don't make a project like this with no idea where you're going. But that wasn't my point. My point is that you can change your roadmap if its only internal, but if you announce it to the public, changing that roadmap becomes much harder to do and has real consequences. It also makes the public expectant about getting announced features at announced times. What happens if they come up with a better way to do things mid development? Welp we're shit outta luck, we're gonna get the crap version or it's gonna get delayed then everyone is mad. Where as before we wouldn't have known about the feature getting made and wouldn't be mad that its going to be 2 weeks longer.
---
Two shot weapons will show 100% hit chance but still miss most of the time.
---
HEY GUYS I HEARD DEMOLITION LOST THE TAG TEAM TITLES!
---
I'm starting Fallout 76 for my first time during this free week**.
---
My plan is to approach it like I do with the other Fallouts. Single Player minded. If I see someone I will stay out of their way, if they wave I'll wave back, if they leave me a gift I'll accept and give my thanks and move on.
---
I'm really excited. To just dig deep into West Vagina.
---
Oh I‚Äôm on Xbox I was gonna make you a weapon but Ig I can‚Äôt
---
I‚Äôm really keen to see more players around!
---
I still hope they one day give us more players on a world.. say.. 51 players..
---
I think you‚Äôre absolutely right from what others tells me as well. So thanks!
---
But still no way to actually download it far as I can tell, since the store page just asks you to buy the game?
---
I only saw the crossbow! Where was the bow? I‚Äôve been looking for a screenshot all morning lol
---
I hope it includes a Vault-Tec workshop kind of content with the ability to build a whole lot of Vault pieces. I loved building Vault structures everywhere in Fallout 4 and as far as I know in 76 these pieces aren't available for building.
---
Though I hope that if they do come they give us the actual assets they use to build their own vaults, plus consistent atrium pieces, pipes and conduits. I've never been able to make even one of my Vault look nearly half as real as Vault 81.
---
Ugh, I‚Äôm sick of people complaining about this. How can people keep implying that there should be NPCs and doesn‚Äôt make sense that they‚Äôre not there when that‚Äôs. The. Plot!
---
Take my money!
---
I think you are confused with what selling out means..... getting paid to lie about a game and getting paid to just play a game are two different things. You dont have a clue what you are talking about.  
---
Getting paid just to play a game when your job is to literrall play games is in no way selling out.....  
---
Salty salty boy
---
Whatever they are downloading should and almost certainly is the latest version of the game
---
It's also the explanation for why Appalachia isn't prominent in future time line Fallout games, why the BoS took so long to expand. There was a really brief entry in, I think, the Fallout bible about how Appalachia was one of, if not THE most radioactive places discovered so far. Interplay intended to do something with that, I think, but they got dissolved. I also could sworn there was something referenced in New Vegas about it, but I recently replayed it and never found it so might be wrong.
---
Also thanks a lot!
---
Thanks man, currently downloading!
---
They mentioned a smaller map, and because you don't need to go scavenging, they won't have to put in scavenge-able junk and weapons. I suspect this mode will actually run smoother even now that they fixed most of the server problems.
---
I got you. I misread and/or added my own assumptions to your comment in my head. I agree. üëçüòÅ
---
Exactly.  And you know what will help get rid of The image Fallout‚Äôs got now? Introducing new interesting content, make it free, and allow new players to form their own opinions instead of watching YouTube video reviews from 4 months ago.
---
3 star Wood legendaries fixed, nice!
---
I like this. That is a great idea. Not intrusive, but also a great welcome to the game
---
Clown Daddy‚Äôs a national treasure. He means no harm
---
If he was free he would be in the wasteland?
---
Lack of offline, mods, and private servers. There are some of us without a solid reliable internet connection that want to play but can't. Hopefully when I can host my own server on my old rig I'll get to play. 
---
I tried getting into this game, but hauling my gaming computer to the library wasn't really doing it for me. What's worse is the fact that I already have the "best" internet available for my address.
---
The Overseer will send you a sternly-worded holotape.
---
I don't think this is true.  People have been foaming at the mouth over the blackbird paint for months and as of last night I have seen zero people wearing that paint on ps4 since they rereleased it.
---
Wrong.  You don't get slap damage now, period.
---
All pacifist does is stop *you* damaging other people.  It even works in survival mode!
---
You should turn pacifist on if you're going to be shooting up the scenery in some event or other or you might accidentally start PvP with some player, but having pacifist on gives you no protection other than that.
---
said it would be available 3pm-4pm BST (my time)
---
Your tamed pets will stay around the camp device itself. If you move the camp device outside of your home your pet should follow it, my friend tried to trap their pet inside their house but their camp device was outside and their sloth teleported out of their house to be by the device.
---
to be honest all I see is this [https://deculture101.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/vlcsnap-1848618.jpg?w=300&amp;h=169](https://deculture101.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/vlcsnap-1848618.jpg?w=300&amp;h=169)
---
So... the servers will make everyone lag, except for the mysterious people who don't and shoot you for it?
---
Agreed. Even a 10 player increase would be a welcomed addition.
---
Loving some of those combat changes!! Sad I can't play till I get back to the U.S. :(
---
Good news everyone ! We got transported in a nuclear wasteland !
---
Did you even watch E3 - Wastelanders is bringing human NPCs to the game and we still have vault raids coming up.
---
Not gonna post any details because I think it‚Äôs against the rules but I had a level 9 offering a white powder jumpsuit for my tse handmade and I ended up losing the gun.
---
We‚Äôve tried it and unfortunately it seems there‚Äôs no set pattern for it. Even logging in with a different account (I have 2 Xbox‚Äôs) seems to not effect the outcome. 
---
I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs more server side and how many are for sale overall based on time, not based on individual characters or accounts. 
---
This makes sense, since you can find the vendor bot a dozen times+ and never see it. 
---
I‚Äôve only seen it once out of all the times I‚Äôve stopped. 
---
Good luck though...
---
r/atetheonion
---
Niiiiiicccceeee... love the additional weapons and armors that looks like it's coming!
---
Not necessarily in Appalachia.
---
I will take your advice and check it out either way.  I remain skeptical - the posts of some others have made me even more so.  Your post remains optimistic and I can appreciate that
---
I rebuilt my camp last week when a low level stole all my crops then sold them. I now have my crops inside in a locked area of my house.
---
I do now.
---
Bastard.
---
seems cant download on PC yet
---
20c is still a great deal.
---
You actually type in middle everything and you can get link like this: [https://fallout.bethesda.net/FunnyMemeIsHere/freeplay](https://fallout.bethesda.net/FunnyMemeIsHere/freeplay)
---
tldr; New players, why bother playing when I can do it for you!
---
He's literally killing people who are trying to get rid of annoying players.  He shouldn't be allowed to trick people like that.  If I think I'm getting an easy kill on a low level I don't want to have to worry about all these high level players killing me.  He should be banned for tricking people like that.
---
No doubt. The sprint, damage numbers, and animation interupts are huge!
---
Thank god we're getting a new main menu screen..Fasnacht was so long ago
---
But we don‚Äôt even get a warming when we‚Äôre about to scrap a favorites item in the legendary machine do we? Not like dropping or scrapping (for non-legendary favs). So yeah, I take my sweet time too in the legendary machine.
---
So you‚Äôre saying they wrote an entire story about all these factions dying because they didn‚Äôt work together (one of the biggest themes of Fallout 76 is *working together*) because of technical difficulties? Why do we have all the robot NPCs then?
---
PC version is coming up for me as 2.35 GB. Rounding up to 3 GB?
---
Shhhhh don't ruin the fun.
---
Boom. Roasted.
---
PC, but it's fine, I want to get it myself. :)
---
&gt;I‚Äôve said it in countless replies the point about BR was that it  illustrates developer priorities and that is what is concerning. 
---
Does it, though?  All development time is limited.  To some extent, it is zero-sum.  And you might have a point if Wastelanders wasn't coming this fall, or if the majority of content in Wild Appalachia wasn't devoted to Adventure Mode.
---
But this simply wasn't the case, so therefore, you don't.
---
Wasnt it proved you were lying though? Of was that some other 900 hour guy...
---
It reminds me of the waving cat statue on Raft now that you mention it.
---
Did you get any legendaries during the defense event? I was hoping I would but after nuking 3 different workshops I'm convinced I can't recreate WS Golf House
---
I really have no idea what they were thinking with battle royale. The whole genre has been taking a nosedive in the past few months. Cod's Br, dead. Battlefield's was doa. Pubg and fortnite have been losing popularity.
---
Sad that there is no solo mode... I‚Äôm sure they will add it later on but still
---
Don‚Äôt be a cranky old man.  If fallout as a franchise is going to survive it needs to appeal to a different demographic and get new players in.  I too have played every Fallout from the beginning... none of the unique content is mandatory.  There was outrage when FO3 was first person.  It‚Äôll be ok. 
---
I‚Äôve actually had a pretty good time explaining the lore and previous games to kids that are picking it up for the first time
---
I'm guessing my friends just stupid lucky
---
I wanted to. I've wanted to play LAN fallout with my friends for years. Unfortunately we got always online, which is problematic for people like me without reliable internet. I get I'm the minority here, but this game does still have valid criticisms. I *really* wish I could play this game without having to haul my gaming rig to the Murillo Library because as you put it-- this game is great and I wish I could enjoy so much more of it.
---
Enemy or comrade.  You decide.
---
I haven't gone through them all yet, but at least one was a two shot shotgun, which I use as a secondary weapon. So could be a few gems. All one stars though.
---
Ax and Smash are pissed!
---
Not really lol, you can only have up to 4, and there is a fill option if youre running solo
---
Just like BR wasn‚Äôt going to happen either right?  Pretty sure they said that months ago...
---
History is on my side bud - sorry to burst your bubble
---
&gt;They're in Dallas with workers from Austin? \*Breathes heavily as a creative professional living in Austin\*
---
Not entirely but sure it‚Äôs part of it. I think they always wanted human NPCs and had a story they could make it work to release them later. Idk which came first obviously but I think they had a story and a desire to have human NPCs. So they made it work.
---
They will have this, as per patch notes
---
I *just* sat down and saw that message of the day. Well, guess it‚Äôs WoW for the day until it comes back online.
---
Discord groups are unlimited.
---
Toward new disappointments and apologies! Here we come!
---
So the Tesla Rifle meta?
---
They really needed to fix how you can hit the ground and cheese the target without losing damage.
---
Battle Royales aren't even really popular right now. They were a few months back but the fad has died down tremendously. 
---
Think about minecrafts battle royale, it worked really well and I am hoping for the same thing with Fallout 76.
---
&gt; a radio host that announces current active events, unclaimed workshops now and then, newly released content, **nuke launches**...
---
Oh god.... I'm just imagining the horror every time the announcer has to say that some town or another has been nuked. Imagine if they have specific dialogue based on which locations are affected by the blast.
---
&gt; Vending: When Fast Traveling to a C.A.M.P. players now spawn near the owner‚Äôs Vending Machine, rather than near the center point of the C.A.M.P.‚Äôs build radius.
---
Incoming traps galore.
---
Yes a saw someone with a plasma rifle that seemed to shoot a flame.... I assumed it was just an available mod for the gun?
---
For an online game?
---
I guess the syringer stays broken
---
Wtf is Fallout Detroit?  Pretty sure all of that is either fan content or a mod, man.  Nothing canon about it
---
I think all you pvpers should just go to survival servers and leave the REAL players alone.  This guy FORCES you to fight him.  Who would think twice about killing a low level who doesn't know the game?  Now I have to worry about all their friends hiding and waiting to kill me?  This isn't fair.
---
Lmao. To suggest he gets paid for every game he plays is pretty extreme dude. I guarantee you that is not the case.
---
You just sound bitter.
---
Near the opening of Wastelanders trailer probably about 20 secs in, where the Overseer's saying 'We've seen many things'
---
A good majority of the bugs from release are fixed, granted, there will be some bugs here and there but it's a lot better than the mess it was at launch.
---
The game is pretty fun to come back to, they've added quite a lot of QoL improvements and new content for free. I stopped playing for a long while and I came back, been a blast
---
Yeah, just finished reading through it.
---
Is that a real question? We're getting a BR mode no one in the community wants, pushing the content we want another season off. Seems like a substantial backstep for an online community, FOLLOWED THROUGH by Bethesda.
---
Hopefully they release an alien season where alien ships crash and you fight 1-4 aliens as a random encounter and such and can get really powerful legendary alien weapons
---
Thank you!!!  Had to download the zip though, just an fyi.
---
I suspect download size difference is based on your region/language. Given you are looking forward to language bug fix supports my theory you're playing in a non native English region?
---
I‚Äôm a CAMP builder, I love building them, the more atoms the better, I haven‚Äôt bought any yet, I will very likely do this, there‚Äôs a lot of very cool things for buildings and I‚Äôve had more than my $60 initial investment of fun, without the whole being shafted for a monthly fee plus expansion fees on top of the base game crap. I‚Äôve spent more money on lesser games and it‚Äôs okay to dip in if it‚Äôs a good deal to you, I don‚Äôt find the regular priced atoms a good deal so I‚Äôve never purchased any
---
What does that matter? You can only be placed with 3 other people regardless of how many you may know lol
---
Just leave stuff in the chest at the overseer's camp. I intend to leave some extra supplies and plans there for new players.
---
You probably found a plasma rifle with a flame barrel.  Different than the plasma caster.
---
II saw the article, bought it, then submitted a ticket after realising it was too early.
---
I've started a new character and the quest are so boring it was like watching paint dry just to get to lvl 35 and after re balancing some stuff is better now so sticking to a curtain build is dumb.
---
100% sure the handmade skins will be a reward for playing BR like a mad man.
---
I took the skin off of my lever action and the ‚Äúunloaded on log in problem‚Äù went away.
---
100% agree, never gave up on the game and really feel like I've been rewarded!! Its annoying that people are still shit talking Bethesda in general but goddamn am I excited about the future of this game!!
---
Look that's a problem. I love the fallout franchise just like you so i still bought and play the game. But don't you think the game would be better without bugs? Don't you think it would be better if you didn't get spawned regularly inside walls? Don't you think the game would be better if the perks actually did what they're supposed to? Because if we didn't bought the game, if no one bought the game, this would never happen again. But we did. I bought the game and so did you and many, many others. I know it's too late and i'm part of the problem but for now all i can do is criticize what i think is bad about the game. Even if i get hate and get called a whiny bitch i'll continue doing so because i care about the game and i deeply care about the fallout franchise.
---
I heard that you couldn't VATS other players, not that vats was disabled
---
Idk about losing the music every time I turn it on it gives me the heck yeah chills
---
No i mean as i solo royale mode, they have squad's but not a solo que
---
You can do it completely alone but it can be fun with a friend or two, there are pros and cons to both..and I‚Äôm pretty sure it will be very easy to see the free trial and the new game Mode should show up[adventure|survival|Nuclear winter] after you start the game
---
thanks
---
I feel like this has been brought up more than once. Wonder how difficult it would be to implement. I would love a bonafide wasteland radio host to take over the airwaves. Radio has become quite stale, and I still love Three Dog and how much the radio revolved around the world and your choices in FO3
---
From my understanding, the maintanence is being done right now
---
I have a theory that there were both t-45s and t-60s in Fallout 3 and the main character just couldn't tell the difference. But that's just own headcannon. It would sound hella dumb if Bethesda officially said that lol.
---
I didn't see that.
---
I play alone and I'm not interested in teaming up with random people.
---
But imagine a server with 25 people in the same "clan" screwed
---
What bugs did you experience?
---
Yep.  It says I don't have enough free space to download the new patch even though my PS4 storage clearly shows 50+ gigs available.  So I'm searching the new feeds because this can't just be happening to me, right?  haven't found anything
---
You can't buy it yet until the game comes back online
---
So basically they're wild animals
---
Oooh that is a great question. I wonder if they have perk cards to make up for it.
---
I‚Äôm not sure about getting the free trial, but as for your second question I‚Äôd recommend just taking your time. Follow the first few missions for the main quests, but take your time exploring the world. The forest region where the game starts out isn‚Äôt very difficult, so that‚Äôs a good time to just take your time. 
---
For your third question, I‚Äôve been playing since the beta and only teamed up a few times, so it‚Äôs definitely possible to go it solo! Having said that, there are events where you‚Äôll run into other players. But those events are more cooperation than teaming up. Hope that helps a little, and I hope you enjoy the game!
---
Found it! Thank you!!! I love bows in any game, so hyped.
---
Yep. Just make our stuff invisible to that stuff. And when we cry and whine on Reddit  ‚Äúwhy can‚Äôt I trade my explosive super weapon to  some guy,‚Äù people can say ‚Äúwell, dummy, you probably turned off it‚Äôs visibility (or whatever).‚Äù Lol
---
That will never happen, its nearly impossible to manage to get people you know into the same BR server as the game does the matchmaking with hundreds of thousands
---
"your opinions are unworthy of mine"
---
"stick to the roads you'll live longer"
---
I looked at some of his other videos and he's obviously a hacker flying around the map and walking on air.  I'm surprised he's not banned, but I'm definitely letting bethesda know.  We can't have these toxic people in our game.
---
Omg. Lmao! That's funny. Are you on psn?
---
it may not fall under the classic definition of mmorpg but it most definitely has an mmo size fan base and they had to build it to accommodate all those different systems connections and servers. not to mention 3 platforms. I am not saying the game is perfect by a long shot but if there's anything I have learned as a "gaming veteran since 96" is that no project this large scale hardly ever rolls out smoothly. I work in the IT field too even on much smaller company sized projects when you're dealing with "new" its always jankie AF at first, then over time you work the bugs out, I do not agree with the current market model of allowing your customer base to also be your quality control. which is currently the new standard, its all based off lean manufacturing philosophies like 6 sigma and crap. (not super well read on them but I have a basic understanding.) essentially because so many companies are doing it now in order to stand a chance financially everyone is gradually shifting over to that philosophy/ practice.(think cell phones industry as another example, always pushing out the next line to stay ahead of the comp before they even have the bugs worked out of existing product. )  sad to say only federally mandated industries are adhering to the old school, build it right before releasing to the public. and that's only because they have too. this trend of game companies using the customers as quality control I beleive is going to continue. currently its in a playable state for me but I honestly didnt expect bethesda to make as many fixes as they have already. they are however rolling out new content instead of focusing on fixing the old bugs which annoys me. but over all I am still ok with it as a game.
---
Hyped to see what they do with the interloper
---
Seriously...  that or 5.56mm
---
Brutally honest answer: You already own the game. Fucking play it and decide for yourself.
---
Adventure mode which is the core base game works off a duel system. 
---
Survival mode removes the PvP restrictions completely. But keeps all the core mechanics.
---
Nuclear winter drops today with a BR mode. Apperatly has story and lore mixed into it.
---
Like the fact Bethesda said BR wouldn‚Äôt happen?  Or the fact that their sales are way under margin?  Or the fact that countless articles and mainstream youtubers have expressed the same sentiments about BR in this game and it‚Äôs future or lack there of...
---
Considering her voice is in the trailer I have a feeling Wastelanders will begin with us finding her, she explains to us why the people returned and will possibly remain as some sort of quest giver.
---
Are there any game modes being planned that are hardcore mode with zero pvp, collab only? No fast travel, significant death penalty, vendors have no caps, etc.
---
Game is good, not as buggy as before. Has some new bugs, but they‚Äôre not game breaking, just really, really, annoying.
---
Content is great, community is good too.
---
I‚Äôd say come back, it‚Äôs worth playing as is right now.
---
Release note claims provide little confidence in light of a history of integrity failures. A history of failures doesn‚Äôt guarantee future incompetence but it does inform the betting odds.
---
Sorry for the noob question, but how do we view it through the link? Possible on mobile?
---
We have been practicing with the events. It's pretty easy actually
---
Alright alright lets slow it down here
---
Cope come fall is gonna be pretty funny
---
/u/Jimquisition
---
Probably about how it would go, lol.
---
I wonder if they took nukashine in to account. Might be able to teleport behind the ring, alive, and thus win as last man standing without combat.
---
Just keep this in mind:  you can download Borderlands: the Handsome Collection (with the new DLC they released to bridge to 3) and a classic Sonic compilation for free this month with a ps+ membership. You can still play them even once the membership has expired.
---
Even if you absolutely hate 76, it's totally worth a month or few days free trial of plus.
---
Just notice your own shop I guess. If you see people stopping by and not buying plans, they must likely have them. This is also saying you aren't posting it at the suggested price. I always go under unless I know it's semi rare
---
The PvP is already the weakest part of the game, and it's time and effort that could be spent on enriching the actual game. 
---
Battle Royale adds nothing of note to Fallout 76. It will have a poor population once the initial release dies down. 
---
That and BR is a tired genre now.
---
I suggested this before and agree with it.
---
Especially since the assets to do such a thing already exist.  They just need to tie it to some kind of invisible, invulnerable enemy.
---
Yeah me either. Prob not gonna touch it u TIL they add solo mode
---
I thought it was a wendigo lol
---
Once servers are back online you‚Äôll have access to this sweet juicy bling coat
---
Really? You honestly think a game rating does anything?
---
Don't get me wrong, I agree with you. But my experience on the console has been a lot of little kids voices screaming over the mic or begging for resources.
---
FO used to appeal to rpg/shooter fans. It used to be an rpg first and shooter second. Now we get this hot mess. The whole problem with modes like this is that the loyal fanbase is getting the middle finger while all the existing bugs remain unfixed and the trashy battle Royale/pvp crowd (which is a resolute minority) are getting fallout flavored pvp modes that won't last.
---
Does Bethesda see this as a success? What's next? Skyrim pvp?
---
I would love to take a game like fortnight or COD and instead of put resources towards their player base for content they wanted, instead ignore them and have a passive pve adventure/rpg system implemented. How would that make all you br fans feel?
---
I agree. People going on ebay and buying full sets of perfect armor, and buying god tier weapons, just for PVP-- and you cant' know what they are wearing, to counter it. You have to guess over and over and over. I'd be so happy if all those legendary effects were gone from PVP
---
Already a sticky on the front FO76 page, guy.
---
No, the only real rewards we were able to see were the new perk cards that at that time, were only unlock-able by playing the BR mode.  I'm hoping thats still the case, we shall see.
---
my camp, my choice
---
I had to download and view in Dropbox
---
What's wrong with it?
---
I'll try that spot too.  Thanks!
---
In the atom shop
---
Ill feed them Mothman wings.
---
I've entered my fair share of Murder CAMPS. The best ones are the ones that have an awesome power connector maze leading to a Vendor that has "prize" items in it.
---
&gt;You know all its going to be is a bunch of people with explosive bloodied builds one shotting each other until everyone but the hardcores quit
---
It doesn't work like that. You don't carry any items, perks, special stats over into the new mode.
---
I'd suggest reading the patch notes, it goes into great detail about how the mode will work.
---
Good to know. However, will medic weapons be useless in this mode when fighting other people? It requires VATS crits to heal the team. That‚Äôs the question. I wonder if they‚Äôll even HAVE medic weapons.
---
Well of course, still nice to finally see it and know when it‚Äôs coming to the game though!
---
If it is locked down like that, that is much better, but this is fallout so I can only hope.
---
I was 12 once too... once.
---
I hope Nuclear Winter brings in so much money they can hire more developers and improve the engine for Starfield, ES6, and Fallout 5.
---
Look at Red Dead Redemption 2.  That game is a masterpiece from a graphical and system perspective.  (I feel the controls are like puppeting through molasses but that's Rockstar). The horse testicles are temp sensitive!   
---
I maintain that shark cards from GTA Online bought that shrinkage.  I want deathclaw shrinkage!
---
Is there nukes in BR?
---
"There was somebody downed around here.....Have you seen them?"  
---
\*munch munch\* "hmmm...?"
---
Yeh, send your gt dude. Always game for teaming, wa surely solo but got together with a few Americans and liked it even more. I'm a UK player so times can conflict but still manage to have some down time with my new found Yankee doodles.
---
It‚Äôs gonna be funny seeing people trying to jump up a platform thinking they have marsupial.
---
Gonna be more funny if I end up doing it.
---
I don‚Äôt normally care about BR‚Äôs, but it sounds like we can earn cosmetics for use in other modes. So I‚Äôll probably play it here and there.
---
Good question. I guess wait until the new mode is added (they are adding it now) then go to Beth's website and see
---
Fun. Simple fun.
---
&gt;According to the Wiki, Vault 79 is the Motown Vault...but not sure if this actual game lore or fan fiction: https://fallout-detroit.fandom.com/wiki/Vault_79
---
"A wiki for a fictional Fallout game set in the Motown Wasteland"
---
You aren't sure?
---
Very true
---
You‚Äôve already voiced your opinion so now nothing more can be done. Todd did not say that he was skirting around the fact the industry is in a pickle. We very clearly have a role in the direction of this game.
---
I see, so its a friendly competition is it?
---
Played for almost 3 hours this morning, I'm in the same boat as you. It's pretty good. Still lonely, much better teaming up with people. But the quests and game itself has gotten much much better since launch. I'm moreso trying to actually level up and learn the game in lieu of the NPC update in the fall. I'm excited. About to get back on now
---
Yess, finally that cage armor is arriving!
---
Yea the patch notes say its matchmaking like with every BR
---
https://youtu.be/uyJz7zpWCqA    
---
I believe you're asking them to get Jim Tom to voice a radio personality.
---
Decide they like the fact that people are friendly and join in...or possibly buy the game and nuke every vendor they see on the map. I can't really think of anything annoying enough to be a problem now that camps are basically safe. Then again, people can be pretty creative when they want to ruin other peoples fun.
---
Yes there is. You just queue and tell it not to automatically add people to your team.
---
So you're taking Switzerland's stance on this.
---
My biggest compliant about nuclear winter and Fallout in general has been the combat and movement. I am so freaking happy they have worked on it. Cant wait to get back in and see what its like. Hopefully big changes from what the patch notes say.
---
This exactly. Fallout 5 will be unrecognizable. I want to ruin someone else's game but adding an rpg/coop mode to a shooter or something and see how their fanbase reacts.
---
What is fucking WRONG with you!!??? Cram is wonderful! Spicy bits of radioactive pork matter blended with cat meat, gelatin, and diseased cranberries... you've clearly never had a properly prepared Cram &amp; cheese sandwich then.
---
Wait, Nuclear Winter is coming out today?
---
well, I wouldn't call him Dogmeat.. But I think having a pet would be great
---
Jesus Christ you must have a unhappy life to be so hostile.
---
It must suck to be such a condescending and cynical cuck
---
Incoming snarky remark in 5 4 3 2 1....
---
Oh yeah I only beg for food and water cause I'm literally out right now and the bar is almost all the way down
---
Go play fortnight. This is fallout.
---
Agree but, though it is absolutely a possibility in games overall, fo76 can barely handle Whitesprings in a nuke zone! I'd be worried if that's what was happening!
---
The Endangerol syringe barrel does nothing
---
That dude is just massively salty about 76 and feels the need to take it out on everyone instead of just accepting he bought a game that didn't click for him. Not even worth replying to when he goes off.
---
76 has issues. No one's denying that. But it's still fun for what it is and they've been fixing the most glaring negative points, so it's improving to be better than what it is. That's a plus.
---
Personally, I'm not pre-ordering any more Bethesda games, but that's because I've learned they think cutting the price by 50% or more two weeks after launch is a great marketing scheme. Might as well just wait a couple weeks to see if it goes on sale first since I *rarely* have time to play on launch day anyway.
---
Ok again. Do you think they first made the plot and then decided to wrap everything else around it? Let me tell you that's not the case. They didn't include npcs for other reasons. Maybe because they're expensive to make. After that decision was made they then proceeded to make up a story which explains why there wouldn't be no npcs. To put it simple: the game doesn't have no npcs because of the story. The story doesn't have npcs because the game doesn't.
---
You are not supposed to be able to hurt anyone in the regular (adventure) mode, if both parties have pacifist mode on.
---
but some people have figured out how to do damage anyway. Of course.
---
Im really intrested to see the new black powder weapon animations.
---
I mean like make it so you have to specify in your account or settings that you'd like to opt into the beta (blizz does this for their games). That way it's open to everyone, but you have to make an effort on your part to get into it. That would take away a lot of the arguments from jackasses on YT who will inevitably treat this like a finished product.
---
At the time when we played in April, yes, it's full on combat with who ever is remaining.  I will say this though, it the few hours we played I don't recall any team having 2 or more team members left by the time it was down to 2 folks left.
---
Don't forget the ice. üéä
---
Then why are you asking for a respec?
---
I‚Äôm here to mock you as long as you claim things that are actually false yes
---
1 per wave IIRC
---
Bruh
---
To shreds you say?
---
Is it rent-controlled?
---
It‚Äôs not the criticism. It‚Äôs the I don‚Äôt like it I won‚Äôt try it, and it shouldn‚Äôt be in the game, and no one wants it bashing attitude. 
---
Your opinion isn‚Äôt everyones, and like it or not Bethesda is still a company that needs to make money same as any other. The fact that they engaged with the community this much speaks volumes on what they want to do.
---
Imo the BR could be a welcoming addition to break up the regular gameplay. BUT as long as it‚Äôs not affecting my progression in the other modes it shouldn‚Äôt matter. Just something else to do. Most likely will bring new players.
---
And as far as pay to win goes they data mined repair kits a couple months after the game released. We knew they would come at some point. So far since then there hasn‚Äôt been another in that category.  To further the point I do SBQ‚Äôs regularly and have 25 or so of the free better version of the repair kit? 
---
Last but not least.. Bugs. 
---
It‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre ignoring them? Every single patch has released a list of fixes, and are literally hand picked from the list compiled here on reddit. Clearly they are putting in the effort here while still pushing new content.  
---
I‚Äôve been in this sub since it had 500 or so people. Voiced my own concerns through out launch as well. 
---
But at that point this sub had no contact with the devs. 
---
Now that it does we have seen much action taken in our requests.
---
Thing is, with all the visual glitches, especially the disco floor lately I kind of hoped....
---
Several times it was all white,all around me...I had the silent hope that this might be a Preview glitch *sigh
---
Welcome to the Appalachia. COUNTRY ROADS!
---
A claim is not a fact. Absent facts, the merit of a claim may be reasonably evaluated based upon the speakers past veracity.
---
Incoming plague doctor mask P2W outrage videos!
---
I read that too. Maybe they meant you don't need to create a Nuclear Winter only character?
---
I started a new account a little while back. Came out the vault and there was a bag. I thought sweet, but then some guy followed me around in the bushes for like a hour
---
 nope
---
I dig my crossbow and all, but the bow should be a lot of fun (hopefully).
---
Im still queing into a squad que but just as a solo so ill come up against teams of 4.
---
Can't wait for the 500 posts about "why can't I play?!" That will show up in the next hour.
---
Sadly no. Ideas how long they said itd be?
---
Thanks for the info.

That‚Äôs good to hear at least.  I loved the idea of MP fallout, but I dislike PvP for these types of RPG games.  I prefer PVE and limited  competition with other players in combat - which has always been wonky in Fallout.  I‚Äôm ok with that against the computer, just not against other humans.
---
I will check it out during free week to see how I feel about total product
---
How about some sort of underground city or something, but not a vault. Place where they‚Äôre creating these robots who look and sound like humans, ready to unleash them on the world above.
---
Yes, mini nukes, IF you find the right amount on nuclear briefcases, in April it was 4 I think, not sure the amount needed now.
---
Yes down the stairs outside the back entrance is where I prefer, if I decide to lead them outside. I make a right turn, run a few steps and turn around start shooting. Because the little passage is narrow, they literally have to line up when they chase you. A high powered ranged weapon can take them all out one by one.
---
Some players explode the cars on purpose, some are accidents, too many variables can happen in the parking lot and all of them make looting very challenging.
---
Do you mind making an imgur upload? I can‚Äôt view on mobile. If not it‚Äôs all good.
---
Everybody starts naked with nothing.
---
Other than that, I agree.  I'm not going to bash the mode.  I may not care for it, but others do.
---
I was out the second I saw that it's teams only.  I would would try it if I could go solo.
---
Makes me wonder about the PC text mods and such. My guess is it gets broken quick like. At least bethesda has been quick to fix stuff like that lately
---
I am setting up my camp by the vault. I can finally unload a bunch of recipes and blueprints at a substantial mark up.
---
About 4,5% of all players on PS4 have a trophy for killing 20 or more players. That's how small the PvP side has been. For me it's because the game doesn't really work with PvP but with this stripped game mode it might be better.
---
You don‚Äôt take any previous items into it.
---
I'm pretty sure it *does* work.  You just don't see the effect in Awareness.  But in practice, if you tag an enemy with a syringe, you do noticeably more damage to it than if you don't.
---
Yeah I get it but if like Survival it has a big BETA tag written on it, it's kinda self explanatory to me...
---
It isn't a mainline fallout game. It's fallout online. It's going to have aspects not present in the main series and be missing things from the main series.
---
Battle Royal is a standalone mode. Not required. Only unlocks cosmetics for adventure and survival.
---
It's going to be interesting to see how it all works out in a fallout engine but there's no need to play if not interested.
---
It's just another way for the online game to make money for continued development.
---
I'm more excited for wastelanders and hate fort night with a passion but I'm going to give NW a shot. If I don't like it, I'll stay in adventure. (But it looks fun, unlocks cosmetics and has some lore hidden in rooms only unlocked by progressing your overseer level.... So I'll probably play just for those.)
---
Autocorrect is a hell of a thing.
---
In the trailer there were options with other special stats like perception. We'll probably have options outside of charisma
---
*rages incoherently in r/falloutlore*
---
Okay, I defended the kid in the fridge. I'm tapping out, I got nothing here.
---
You have to remove all mods in order to join the BR, even text mods
---
PVP in Nuclear Winter will be different... and in all for it. Huge PvE content comes this fall but a brand new mode that‚Äôs free and gets you cosmetics sounds good to me. It‚Äôll be fun
---
This is deep
---
The bow is my favorite weapon it has been for years. When I go hunting that's all I use a bow and a sidearm.
---
Have you tried reaching out to Matt Grandstaff (https://twitter.com/gstaffinfection) or any other community manager on twitter about your issue?
---
Usually takes 2-3 hours.
---
Yes. That starts soon as maintenance concludes in a while
---
That‚Äôs why I said it seems okay. This is Fallout we‚Äôre talking about, I‚Äôm not holding my breath anymore
---
Lol yeah im down for whenever my schedule is flexible pike I said my gt is Talal8812
---
I know. But if you find a medics weapon, it‚Äôll probably be useless is what I‚Äôm thinking.
---
So are there new perk cards for adventure mode also? 
---
They make it sound like only some are specific to Vault 51 and others apply to all game modes.
---
Is this a drug? Would it replace grape tats?
---
 Robots for the camp would be very cool, would even open up some new perks and a robot building station like FO4, perhaps make them sellable to people who do not want to invest perks/time into robotics.
---
You said it yourself, "Fallout" was meant to be an open world story driven and exploration game"
---
This is Fallout 76, a different game experience because it is online and with that brings different opportunities that Fallout was not able to bring to the table.
---
Somehow the age old concept of "If you don't like it, don't play it" has not made its way to you yet. When it does, you will be much happier and save a lot of time posting your opinions on the internet
---
The patch notes say it‚Äôs based on squads of four but when matchmaking you can opt for ‚Äúfill‚Äù which means it will matchmake you to others with a space in their squad if your playing alone.
---
You're not wrong! I recently teamed up with a lower level in survival mode at his workshop. He added me as a friend. NBD. Next day I'm pvping, and get a message complaining I killed him. Didn't notice it was him, wasn't looking for him.. Sorry bud. Next day a PS message wakes me up at 11pm. "Hey mate can you help me out for a bit." BLAH
---
That‚Äôs Fanon, it‚Äôs not official so we don‚Äôt know anything on 79
---
Yes, all Bethesda games have mods
---
 [Someone wrote up a pretty good "Is it worth it" post recently that's worth a read!](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bn33ul/is_this_worth_buying_or_coming_back_to_the/)
---
It's waaaay more fun starting out with no help at all... just figuring shit out on ur own. I recall fondly my first night when 76' was released... two bottles of wine, two packs of ciggies, heater going full throttle...10pm became 4am rather quickly. üôÇ
---
It says on [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) that you can play for free, but when you click the link it brings you to the store to buy it.
---
See you after one week.
---
I‚Äôm done all of them.  These two are the only ones left for me to become a squirrel!  That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so frustrating haha!
---
This is how I read it as well.
---
I would have put actual cash, American, hard currency, dollars down that this was going to add winter weather if someone had asked me. Glad no one did.
---
Bethesda, give me Rad Blizzards!
---
Ok, so being able to fly around in 76 isn't hacking?  He should be banned.  Plain and simple.
---
In 20 minutes.
---
I do not know, my guess is this is more of a Bata to see how the server takes/handles it and get feedback from the community before releasing it in full.  A test server of sorts.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm going to be playing BR for this sole reason. The cosmetics and CAMP plans that will be locked behind the mode.
---
Fallout: Hunger Games! May the odds be ever in our favor üòÇ
---
valid point buddy but i am by no means able to equip them with endgame gear they still have a long way to go on their own the goal here is to just make the way to the endgame more enjoyable and diverse
---
for example if you want to do a heavy weapons character without help you have to rely on rifles till the early 40s most probably
---
and the other thing is that this is more of an asthetic overhaul 
---
if you want to check out my account so you have a better idea of what i am talking about anyway i hope not anyway feels bitter about this post :)
---
thanks for the feedback anyways btw what does tldr stand for?
---
I can see no reason for this not to work.
---
All that file does is override the 'regular' ini.
---
The game is not enabled to load loose files and what is packed in the ba2 containers won't load unless 'instructed' by the custom ini file so it will run 'vanilla' once you do that.
---
I am just hoping that they haven't messed up the ability to 'load mods' in the regular game in the process.
---
Given how low a priority would be to fix such a thing it would be pretty hideous.
---
Wait and see I guess.
---
You do realize that if you build your camp higher off the ground your camp budget i belive increases because i think....and dont take this as gods word....but the higher the camp i think you can add more stuff because it counts ground particles....so no ground more stuff....like fallout 4 system. I feek like i watches a youtube video of people putting themselves in middle of water for this reason. My camp is about 10 stairs high with the highest level able to place ground items only.
---
U-ranium U-ranium U-ranium
---
this is false; read the notes again
---
It's so creepy. Or a scorched in it's near petrified pose sliding towards you. Gross.
---
I just hope that whoever we are getting will be as awkward as Travis.
---
&gt;When the Fill option is enabled the matchmaker will find additional teammates for you. **When disabled, no additional players will be added to your team.**
---
That part made it seem like you still have the option to go in on a 1 person "team".
---
LETS HEAR IT FOR RED EYE
---
Are you really being serious? It‚Äôs a game and people can play it any way they want, if you don‚Äôt like it move on to the next server.  It doesn‚Äôt matter if your pve player or pvp player. When and if you run into these players then go ahead and try to kill them all with you 16 explosive weapons lmfao
---
I know, right? That's like half of an entire typical game
---
When we played in April, they we're all Vanilla.
---
I‚Äôm telling you if you don‚Äôt like it submit a ticket and move on. All you can really do is not give them money for things you don‚Äôt want to buy. It‚Äôs fine to voice your opinion but this just comes across as whining because it isn‚Äôt perfect despite being a step towards what you do want
---
Player events hosted by show host to determine radio playlist.
---
Come on people, don‚Äôt forcefully push 76 into the abyss, give them some good ideas other than a radio show everyone will get bored of in 2 hours.
---
Try, you know, bringing the game to life maybe.  Just a thought.
---
They should have the TV-announcer from FO4 having survived and making news broadcasts on the Radio between songs to announce when big events starts on your server. Also, that would give us more Ron Perlman!
---
What happens in the Wasteland...
---
I think you can choose not to have your squad 'autofilled' and play alone, though you'll likely be squaring off against full squads... so not ideal.
---
I don't think they mean companions in that way. I think they just mean characters that will have storylines that you'll meet, hell, get to know them, bond.
---
Does bass building feel out of place or natural?
---
You dont make any sense
---
Description:¬†SCP-096 is a humanoid creature measuring approximately 2.38 meters in height. Subject shows very little muscle mass, with preliminary analysis of body mass suggesting mild malnutrition. Arms are grossly out of proportion with the rest of the subject's body, with an approximate length of 1.5 meters each. Skin is mostly devoid of pigmentation, with no sign of any body hair.
---
3 dogs !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
They will go back up after the maintinance is done
---
... that‚Äôs the whole point of having a survival mode. If you don‚Äôt want that, play adventure.
---
The patch added some snow textures so who knows... Probably just for Nuclear Winter though.
---
Geeeeez. How many vaults are in this game? o.O
---
Save some for Fallout 5 please.
---
Making the fine people of Helvetia proud.
---
I wasn\`t really talking about the bots, it was more of a general idea :)
---
don't hope to kill anyone. The players that bought the game before, have all legendary items duped 10000000000000000000000000x times. It's fucking stupid that survival mode uses the same characters made on exploits.
---
Probably not. At this rate, I doubt it will be recognizable. It will probably be a pvp only game with no npcs and day one patches with nothing but mods.
---
&gt;"Discovered: Cranberry Bog" \*Screeching Noises Intensifies\*  
---
&gt;Interesting first play through...
---
Yeah, I knew of the blackouts, but didn't realize where I'd end up... there was some concern when I woke up.
---
And you know this how?
---
Exploding or spiked arrows would be real good too.
---
We'll have to wait and see for more info. It wouldn't suprise me if they added NPC companions. So it would be like you and 2 friends, with 1 npc. So max of 4 in a team xD.
---
Would you put a useful link, kind sir?
---
I don't think fallout needs to change their target audience. Single player games are as popular as they can be. There's literally no reason to attract fortnite kids.
---
That's just the wrong mindset, bro!
---
&gt;We‚Äôve also added a ‚ÄúFill‚Äù option you can toggle on or off when queuing alone or in a partial team. When the Fill option is enabled the matchmaker will find additional teammates for you. When disabled, no additional players will be added to your team.
---
Doesn't this mean that you can enter the vault as a team of one, disable the fill option and effectively play solo?
---
I've seen all this guys' videos and the only one with that in it was them *recording and reporting* a hacker. I thought this was all a joke but I can't tell anymore. Begone, thot.
---
Yes.  It's a barrel mod.
---
If it doesn‚Äôt carry over, then I hope they‚Äôll still be there if you switch back to adventure or survival mode. It‚Äôs a pain in the butt..and expensive to re serum.
---
Im excited just picked up fallout 76 for $11
---
That's what worries me
---
i‚Äôll join
---
It's irrelevant. Just wait 17 more minutes.
---
That‚Äôs basically the Institute, however I would of liked seeing some gen 1 synths in the game
---
What a friendly crowd Imgur has...
---
No but really, isn't there a new quest featuring a goldmine of sorts? Perhaps it's hidden in Vault 79 and we have to discover it to help save our faction?
---
Reasons
---
too long didn't read. You seem like a swell guy and don't deserve my cold assessment.
---
Wow for real? üòÆüòÆüòÆ
---
It‚Äôs the new drug from the project paradise event I‚Äôm not sure if grape mentats offer any better prices. Formula p is easy to craft in large amounts however. It only requires ash rose blood leaf and the kiliedopore flower found in project paradise.
---
It is vault 79. Its in the wastelanders art

If you *needed* them then you would be forced, but you *want* things that you can get or ignore. You are not entitled to every item and outfit in the game and you decide for yourself what's worth working for and how much you're willing to spend. If it's too much for you to spend your time playing through something that you don't like to get a want of yours there are (and will be) plenty of opportunities to find something that suits you. 
---
Which of the new cosmetics do you want so badly, by the way?
---
Oh great, another player that doesn't care about the toxic griefer playerbase.  How would you like it if you went to kill a level 2 for being annoying and then your whole camp is destroyed?  You'd probably change your tune real quick.
---
Just wondering why you‚Äôre calling it as patch 7?
---
I downloaded a radio mod in fallout 4 with this song and it played as I blew up the prydwen and it was so dope
---
Yes sorta. You will prob die tho because you will be on your own against teams of 4
---
But Travis gets better if you progress and becomes a freaking OVERCONFIDENT annoying prick. Please no Travis! :(
---
lulz.
---
Well shit, you've blown my mind, then. I was certain I read it, but fair enough.
---
You got a link to where you got the PDF? Would love to grab another copy of it, been a minute since I read through it. Now I'm worried other info I remember was wrong, lol.
---
"Hey gurl... lemme put my radtoad into your snallygaster"

I heard this in three dogs voice...
---
Remember kids, don't feed the Yao Guai, err I mean noobs !
---
You‚Äôre not being toxic, just whining.
---
Where exactly can you see through the map at Thomas farm? I just went there and wasn‚Äôt able to find anything.
---
its not out yet. be patient
---
Maybe some jokes about appalachilli and posum bacon. With the new town coming in being a space station. Id imagine it would be the perfect place for a radio station.
---
I worked pretty hard to make sure people spawned safely at my new camp... hope this doesn‚Äôt end up putting them in my foundations.
---
Relax damn
---
Think free week is only pc, not sure tho
---
Where is it posted that there's no VATS?
---
I stayed away from this game after the launch reception it's got, but from the tiny bit I played before the maintainence set in, it seems really fun so far. Always happy to see developers owe up to their mistakes, and I'm glad they've not just jumped ship and abandoned the game.
---
That‚Äôs why people say don‚Äôt play. If you can‚Äôt wait for them to keep working out bugs check back later.
---
TL:DR?
---
Yeah that's how it usually works
---
You shouldnt have stoped you are gonna be stuck for awhile also yea I get what you mean
---
Never been a fan either, but some games do it well.
---
a new build will also start out with nothing.
---
food/water will do the same job as stimpak's. lev112 and still only use a stim in dire need.
---
ammo EVERYWHERE . use melee or single round weapons until you have enough junk  to CRAFT ammo. steel,lead, gunpowder(old money and acid).
---
best of luck with rosie at lev 15.    you dont NEED to rush thru.

The women of¬†New Vegas ask me a lot if there's a Mrs. New Vegas. Well, of course there is. You're her. And you're still as perfect as the day we met.
---
It's an easy and good-looking aesthetic, the Savage Divide is Raider territory and is my favourite strip of the map, the idea of playing a wandering ronin who judges each situation in a way unfettered by any restraint or structured control can definately be appealing to some people, the Bone Raider Excavator Armour (such a reason entirely in itself...)
---
I've found the raiders to be violent and aggressive, but very honourable in how they cheat and grief :-p
---
A respec is more preferable but if that's limited for some technical reason then buffs are next on my list of options
---
Can we have auditions?
---
That‚Äôs the biggest problem w noobs
---
I loved his shitty punk songs too, so fucking raider but so fuckin good.
---
My word, that's a great idea. Good thinking
---
Yes on pc. They get a freaking perk load out manager.
---
Honestly if we hadn't gotten such good news about the Wastelander update I definitely wouldn't be getting this, but it sounds like Bethesda is actually listening and is finally moving in the right direction, so I don't mind supporting that and getting a bitchin' coat in the process.
---
Haha yes! That's what I did too. I was like guess I'll be here awhile haha. I never saw a nuke drop either, so I am suspicious as to whether there was one or not.
---
‚ÄúBut I WANT it‚Äù. Literally what I would tell my mom about a toy before she would say, stop whining.
---
What if someone puts the vending machines at the edge of a cliff facing off of it?  Do you spawn in mid air, do the Looney Toons look, then plummet to your death?
---
Yeah place your camp on elevated surfaces and you will increase height max is 10 stories but you wont be able to farm unless you can deal with 9. Npc will stop tracking you on my lowest living quarters like level 8. Decon shower sits on my 9th floor with some tricky placement
---
You say that you will continue to 'ride Bethesda' but clearly your tone is now different.
---
Being seduced isn't a bad thing, and most people actually enjoy it. It's okay that it happened, but you should be a bit more honest about it if you're going to share it with everyone.
---
True, but people wanted a challenge and with the right tactics I suspect it would be doable. Part of it will depend on how quickly you can get your hands on a scoped weapon. Harder to be sneaky as part of a team.
---
Also, would anyone like to add me on Xbox, feel free. I play primarily single player games, but I'm branching out into the online scene!
---
From what I've seen, some perks combine existing perks (every gun weight reduction perk is now 1 perk in nuclear winter. Other replace mutations in nuclear winter. Frog legs functions like marsupial but it's a perk card.

Here's a shit sandwich I made JUST for you. It's free, you'll LOVE IT.

Are they ever going to fix the damn music challenge?!

This person needs to be voiced by Sam Elliot.
---
Makes me happy reading this man, other people really make the game and it‚Äôs awesome seeing everyone helping eachother out. Enjoy! It‚Äôs definitely a unique game.

And it was right then, that God Howard gazed down from an orange colored sky, upon thy wasteland and said. 
---
Nuclear snow and canvas bags for all!
---
Where is 79 on the map? Is it in game?
---
I would imagine workbenches are op, but the base building itself has promise in my opinion. Loved the building in Fortnite but is was just way too fast paced for me to keep up. Thanks for all your answers!
---
Because i capped something, im whining? , especially the way "YOU"  put? Youre pathetic man, completely.
---
I‚Äôd say 1 settlement per region so it would max out at 6 but I don‚Äôt they‚Äôd go that far yet. 
---
My best guess is that we will have 2-3 city like settlements similar to Megaton, Diamond City, Goodneighbour and Rivet City (uninstanced) and maybe the odd outpost or two following the borders of each region or spaced out within a region that a city settlement may or may not be in to greater extend existing lore while adding new lore to the upcoming questline
---
No thanks. I still feel cheated. We payed for a full game, got given a ubfisjdd mess that 6 months down the line is still a broken mess.
---
Triggered here too?  Sad
---
LMAO!!!
---
I'm sitting at 3 charisma and just swap out Lone Wanderer and Hard Bargain.
---
&gt;We‚Äôve built an all-new Perk Card system specifically for Nuclear Winter and added 73 new Perk Cards, some of which can only be used during Nuclear Winter matches.
---
73 new cards
---
some of which only in NW
---
which means some of which also in the other modes, right?

---
I do wonder about giving them too much and taking some of the early challenges away.
---
Building myself up from scratch with my crappy camp are some of my fondest memories of FO76, I still have the screenshots on my loading screens. I played from the first few days after launch, and although amazingly I saw a lvl50 dude in PA already, there was no help. Up hill both ways yadda yadda...
---
Because MD is the actual sausage factory and a visit there poses a much greater risk of someone spotting a secret formula. An offsite meeting means not having to upend all the work going on in the actual studio while guests are in the building.
---
Give me a Husky Bethesda. Im going to name him Frodo and we will be best friends.
---
Dang I still got 6% left. Can‚Äôt wait üò©
---
I have no idea, but I guess we won't be able to obtain one. Since only our character appearance and SPECIAL? stats will transfer to the mode. With that in mind, I somehow want to test it and provide as much data to Bethesda as they need.
---
I‚Äôm also referring to the returning players hoping to get better/meta weapons. They played and left for whatever reason. They should still have caps to use. Either way, it‚Äôs a way to take advantage of the situation.
---
I'm so glad! It was a pleasant suprises to say the least.
---
Still getting the feel for everything. I'm having a tough time finding "direction" like I usually find in other rpg's. Any suggestions on that front?
---
Thats because most of the toxic people got banned ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇü§£ü§£ü§£
---
What about all the players trap camps with no floors beneath their vending lol
---
Always great to hear those who were once apprehensive are now trying and enjoying the game :)
---
I don't like it myself, so i just don't play it. The end.
---
I honestly wouldn't know. I started with Nintendo, moved to Halo in the glory days of Halo 3 custom games, then Oblivion and Fallout 3, Skyrim, Stellaris, and the classic Fallouts; that's my entire history with video games. I don't think I've ever played a BR before.
---
Que?
---
I‚Äôm hoping for something like this too.
---
Also totally random thought but the notorious Roswell incident happened in early July (6th or 7th depending on sources), would be neat to get an alien event around that time. 
---
Maybe a crashed UFO where we have to fight off waves of ‚Äúonlookers‚Äù (ghouls, scorched, etc) and ultimately transport or defeat the alien. Idk just thinking out loud
---
Along the same line, an event could take place where you defend the radio station and towers!
---
&gt; 52-player
---
Uh, so they have a new engine?
---
Fair enough, honestly the root of my gripe here is the grinding I will have to do. To give you more context, I'm currently halfway through re tuning my build for big guns because I realised too late that my build can't do much against scorched beasts. Now I'll probably put that on hold to prep for Wastelanders
---
I have no issues with PvE. I still 1 shot most things with sneak (2.5x dmg), and with a high base luck, my crit meter fills in 3 shots or less. This is also why I started moving away from CRIT perks in luck, I'm doing 1875 dmg with a non-crit sneak shot, 1500 with just a crit shot, or 3375 with both. 
---
At 19% health (52 hp), I do 750+ base  damage with a BE lever action, 1100+ with a BE BP rifle, and 450+ per shot with a semi-auto BE handmade. 
---
It works in PvP as well, but it becomes more of a "who shoots first, wins" scenario. With the 1-shot restriction in Survival, you're better off with DPS rather than front end dmg.
---
That was a nice touch.
---
Very nice capture, now if only the nuke actually had an effect on the buildings and landscape even temporarily...
---
I find it kinda annoying and over dramatic. I love the intro music to FO4 in comparison. I'm hoping the new music will be a little more low key.
---
I just tried and the free trial seems to just be redirecting to the buy page. Here's hoping they get it up soon!
---
The ones your talking about are nuclear winter exclusive it has 10 exclusives and the rest are in game I think they said 79 total I wonder what we get to play with now.
---
During year 2 of Ultima Online, Origin did a similar thing, pulling a group of their most critical 'ranters' (what we might call influencers today) to Austin for a get-to-know-us workshop. We got a 10 minute tour of the building, but other than that, everything else that weekend was done at offsite locations.
---
They wanted to woo us, but didn't trust us inside the vault.
---
I'm still holding out for Modus to take up his true destiny of being a radio personality.
---
Maintenance usually ends within 3 hours of start. Probably around 10:00 am PST
---
I REALLY hope some consolidation perks will make their way into adventure/survival. If love if I could free up a point or two in my builds.
---
This may also make trap basses easier to build now that you have a sort of welcome mat.
---
Did you find having VATS disabled to improve the experience?
---
I'll pass on settlers.
---
Tbh I was kinda hoping for rad storms :p
---
Oh, my God, y'all it's a nuclear explosi...oh...it's just Whitesprings...again. we now return to our regularly scheduled programming.
---
Okaay? Passive aggression aside, we were talking about mods that Bethesda has personally allowed like what Fallout and Skyrim eventually got (not CC). Creating your own mods through Nexus essentially hacks the game, but I‚Äôm not saying that negatively. Just phrasing correctly.
---
Yep this happens often and all we ask if for you to one day return the favour to somebody else. üòÑ

By "random" ammo do you mean missiles, mini nukes and grenade rounds?  Those can get very heavy. Same with junk. When I was grinding the 7600 wood challenge at any given time I would have thousands of wood scraps on my person. I'd drop a few hundred for any low level players I saw at their camp, but my generosity had more to do with my growing encumbrance than any goodness inside of me.
---
My point was that bethesda changed the lore for enclave armor already.
---
Im not against the new power armors.
---
&gt;Your opinion isn‚Äôt everyones, and like it or not Bethesda is still a company that needs to make money same as any other.
---
Battle royale really isn't necessary for them to make money. From my experience once they go down the battle royale road there's no coming back. It's just a cheap and easy way to make cash. 
---
&gt;And as far as pay to win goes they data mined repair kits a couple months after the game released.
---
To be honest i don't care about the repair kits at all, i actually like them because Because the sbq drops them. But that's not my point. They said they'd do one thing and then proceeded to do another. That's a problem. 
---
&gt;Last but not least.. Bugs. It‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre ignoring them?
---
Well... Actually they do ignore them. There are many bugs that affect a lot of players daily though people simply don't realize. Not many people know about the bugs, which also means not many complain about them. And so Bethesda literally ignores them.
---
I was really hoping for a fix on Possum Scout Badge quests
---
No PVP VATS. It is still there for the creatures.
---
LOL
---
Um, I'm under the impression that we take nothing into the mode. No armor, no aid. I dont' think we can take Nuka Shine in. But. Can we make it in there?
---
This is kinda true ngl
---
I suddenly feel like I need a human sacrifice to appease my lvl 200 ass.
---
Alright I'm gonna download and tell you guys the most interesting adventure perks I see
---
I definitely will
---
So I need to look for people with names like dropbear to have a chance of beating them, since I am terrible at pvp?
---
I turned it on to listen to it it doesn‚Äôt feel like it matches fallout there‚Äôs some parts that kinda work but idk it‚Äôs weird you would have to listen to it.
---
We just had an update and servers are still down once they‚Äôre back up I reckon you‚Äôll be able to find and download it
---
Go get some fresh air, it helps the brain work a little better.
---
Sure hope Nuclear Winter does good. The comments during the Bethesda portions of E3 were so toxic and negative.
---
It's not up yet
---
Yeah that‚Äôs how I read it also.
---
It's better to nuke south of Harpers Ferry, you get glowing ones in the burrows, and ALL flux types in the swamp south of it. Or the Cranberry bog. Both nukes zones are far better than whitespring. You can only get yellow and red flux, and a few purple north of the mall, while HF and Cranberry forest drop all types a plenty.
---
Only a few things from be aside from the actual excitement for the update. The raiders at the fallen space station need to call themselves the Space Cadets and some be wearing the space suits that you find there. (Or found after this update since they might not be there now?) . And how is this going to work for players that are going to be coming fresh to the game afterward the update. If this is an after scorched events type thing, don't know how it will work with players going through the original main quest but the new people are now in appalachia as well.
---
&gt;Dude, if you're reading this, thanks for everything last night.
---
üëÄ
---
Yes, I think it evens the playing field a bit for those that don't use it at all.  I'm a pretty heavy VATS user myself with a rifle build but I didn't miss it at all.  
---
Was it said there would be no VATS in NW?  Maybe i missed that, either way I think it works.
---
Nah it was ammo like shotgun shells, .44, 50 cal., .38, etc
---
Keep tryin, fellas. I'm sure you'll get that pesky Whitesprings someday.
---
been there from the start,but instead of mode, the player has to make that choise.
---
ie. easy feckin peasy mode = autoaim (vats), perks (blooded etc), super duper weapons(tse's) and tiger (tigers like to bounth) like mutations.
---
dont use all that, and fo76 becomes a VERY different game.
---
Fo76rt nite. Piss off bethesda.
---
Go ruin someone else's beloved franchise. That isn't fallout.
---
Terrible fucking idea.
---
I'm excited for you! So much for you to do! Welcome to Appalachia!
---
stand at vault 76 nukashrines instead üòÇ
---
It is! Even without any perks it was stronger than my bloodied sledgehammer with rank 3 slugger on!  Amazing
---
Your food bar doesn't* have to be completely empty. When I did the challenge, I was able to kill a frog and complete the challenge only being in the red.
---
Seconded. Give us a couple awesome hosts for faction radios. Take Three Dog and Red Eye for inspiration.
---
Free fast travel and new way to discover the map! lol
---
Dog. The Dog.
---
lol.. expecting bug fixes..
---
temper your expectations...
---
Three dog's father
---
Good idea. I've done it.
---
Good to know, I didn't want to risk it since under the status screen it only said starving when it was zero
---
Probably not.
---
Yep. 
---
It's gotten a bit better over the years and while I'm not thrilled with the game, the 76 community is quite nice.   
---
I think the frequent changes from 2 to 3, then NV then 4 kinda filtered out all the old haters and angry folks.   
---
LOL. I mean if folks think people were pissed about Fallout 76 on the subreddit here, I could tell some stories about how the NMA community responded to Fallout 3.
---
There were a few people discussing similar events yesterday morning on Xbox
---
&gt;Creating your own mods through Nexus essentially hacks the game
---
Literally what? that's the dumbest shit I've ever read lmfao
---
New players are always lurking here.
---
I mean, it *is* a great way to explore the rest of Appalachia without having to walk too far. I know I would.
---
They will go online when the maintinance ends
---
So anything with Wasteland Whisperer is just pacified? And it's like scorched and ghouls and stuff?
---
This is a great patch and major thanks to Bethesda for the fast traveling and combat and purveyor fixes. 
---
Just curious though if the challenge and possum badge fixes are coming anytime soon?
---
You mean G-O-D?
---
The fact that your comment is at - 12 votes at the moment clrearly shows the type of peoplesupporting this game: ignorant sheeps.
---
Would be good as long you include a Clown suit, Lv 1 Rolling Pin and Toxic Goo in the welcome bag

It is good, luckily I don't use PA very often.
---
Qu√©?
---
Did you know that an anti armor doesn't do anything on energy guns? Literally nothing? Did you know that class freak doesn't work with several mutations? Because a lot of people don't. And i think these are issues that need fixing though i also think they'll never get fixed
---
I ask this question a lot and hope you might be able to provide an answer:  if it's that easy, if the work has already been done, why haven't they been fixed?
---
I don't mean it snarkily, I know corporations silo up and require red tape, but if the solutions have been out there for years why aren't they being used? Is the hurdle legal, technical?
---
But sometimes someone has a clue
---
But what about zoidberg?
---
Updated, thanks!
---
If that's really the Laser Musket, it would be both weird and cool. Weird because didn't the Minutemen create it? (Hence the reason it got removed in the first place) Cool because **fuck yeah laser musket!**
---
iTs RolE PlAyINg BRaH...
---
Bullshit. Link the video then. I already said what it was.
---
I like Wall of Voodoo just as much as the next guy, but I've got to disagree with you on this one.  It *is* an excellent cover, but the sound is too modern for Fallout.  It took me a long time to accept the Beach Boys in the game (whom I am also a fan of) because the music doesn't "fit"
---
Like with the current quest system, only quest owner will be able to talk thru the dialogue.
---
Would have ruined it TBH, this coming from someone who mains a bloodied VATs build
---
"7.5gb" oh fuck
---
Mission abort, Mission abort!

"Hey, granpaw?  Thewres a set-el-ment that needs you hewp.  Hewre, I'wll mawk it on you mappy."

---
Oh no I totally get it, that‚Äôs why I posted it.  The Onion could have written about any game, or even subject matter, but they didn‚Äôt, and that makes my heart happy.
---
Never ever seen anyone know on here before.
---
I kind of wish that we could equip any clothes/masks we‚Äôve gotten from adventure and survival mode and bring them into Nuclear Winter. Would be fun to run around in a bunny mask!
---
Hah. Screw that!
---
I've been committed to a CHA build from the get-go. I've suffered this long with it, I deserve a reward.
---
Could never keep an nda. Worst person to put in a beta, everyone and their grandma would have known everything!
---
Wonder how a lvl 2 would fare in the Cranberry bog with no caps and nothing but a party hat?
---
I would definitely feel bad, and would probably have to rescue them, lol.
---
It's literally... Survival.
---
Bethesda has hinted that monsters of the wasteland have been adjusted to be easier. Could you give us any clues as to your experience with this? How are they different?
---
Maybe if you take your griefer blinders off you can see that he's obviously a hacker.
---
https://youtu.be/43xtYtUOifU
---
If you look at the roadmap, there's Nuclear Winter the battle royale game mode and Nuclear Winter, the DLC. 
---
We sadly didn't get any announcement on the latter. Who knows what that'll bring in terms of new build options.
---
I think it's one of those wait and see sort of things. Just a shame they weren't ready to present the full road map during E3.
---
lol wut?
---
are you serious clark?
---
Probably the same thing that occurs now when at a vendor, it will say they are busy and we wait until our turn. Biv I think is kinda special because you just wait for him to give you a daily or you‚Äôre reporting back, no real interaction other then that
---
I have no idea about BR games, but do the items spawn all over the place pretty randomly all the time, or do the same things spawn in the same locations in every match?
---
If it's random, then strategy isn't going to be much of an option. It's entirely based on luck and personal aiming/movement skill. Which is the part that switches me off. I've always been a stealthy, small guns, patiently-clear-the-area kind of player. If I don't reliably have the gear and perks to support my chosen playstyle, I'm just not interested :)
---
Go to Bethesda's website. Should be some pinks on there somewhere
---
"Becsude one dog ain't enough, and two is too low"

You must get off a lot then.
---
‚ÄúI call that one: ‚ÄòI wanna rock your body‚Äô, and in parentheses: ‚Äòto the break of dawn‚Äô‚Äù
---
Yes one time he said the magical number 21 minutes and he was right
---
I just rewatched the E3 Fallout 76 premiere and the lead director definitely mentioned settlement additions. He was vague but he seemed excited about it.
---
Definitely a good move, and I use VATS a lot.  It's way too much of a crutch for riflemen to just use headshot crits on others.  I'm also a rifle guy.
---
A lever gun with true mods is probably going to be very good in BR, because the hipfire accuracy on that thing is crazy even with stabilized mods.
---
That, is a good idea. Wish I would have farmed the costume shop more.
---
Do it do it do it do it
---
Yes!
---
Yes, but sarcastically!
---
No, but eventually yes!
---
Yes, yes 1000 times yes!
---
Why do iam afraid that all my stuff is gone after i play a round BR ? ...
---
In addition to the Space station, I'd say... Flatwoods, Whitespring, and Watoga perhaps with a questline to change the virus so the robots do not attack the settlers.
---
Say what you will about Fo76 but Bethesda always nails the music
---
They go by eastern time, its still morning and the update hasnt even finished yet. Wait a bit
---
Give all your legendaries to me, I'll see that she gets them.
---
Lmao, do you not know about marsupial?
---
looks like we got a time traveler here...
---
yes I know.. time zones..
---
everything is based upon US Pacific time...
---
If the settlers could actually stop the mole rats from destroying my generators and taking my vending machines offline that‚Äôd be great! The turrets are always napping üí§
---
Will you lose your junk and stuff in nw when you die with your existing char?
---
It‚Äôs based around est time.
---
you get drunk, black out, and literally wake up somewhere random in Appalachia.
---
Totally agree
---
It would probably have to be built from the ground up. Just a pipe dream.
---
We found a Brotherhood report on these strange creatures, and it appears they are
---
\[Data Corrupted\]
---
Glad to hear that. As long as there aren‚Äôt legendaries I‚Äôll gladly give it a shot.
---
Legendaries would destroy any semblance of balance and frankly wouldn‚Äôt even make sense to find in this mode
---
Whitesprings mostly has yellow. I like seeing variety. Nuking Charlestown is profitable
---
Awesome stuff. Really interested how our camps can be incorporated into this new mode. Will make for some cool designs , could even turn the tide of a battle.
---
If I have nukashine I always leave it at the vault or overseer camp, just as a welcome gift to easily explore the map üòÖ
---
Sounds a little Striking Vipers X-ish
---
Fractions don't sound fun to me! Math was always my best subject, but I don't want it in video games! (Sorry, I had to)
---
I will thumbs down you and make a funny rubber toy squeaky sound.
---
I've been poking around here lately since my friends have been playing this again on consoles, and now there is a free trial. The crazy thing i'm just learning though is that there is an npc named Wooby, and that has been my friends nickname for 20 something years. Weeeird man.
---
I would be down with kicking the BOS's ass back to Cali.
---
Free States for life!
---
it seems like such an easy makeshift weapon tbf, i like those kinds of guns
---
Perfect Storm?
---
21 it is then. I stand corrected.
---
Only against other players. You can still use VATS against AI creatures
---
I think a lot of newbies are excited to dig deep into Vagina.  Just make sure Appalachia gives consent.
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/347521/fallout-76-maintenance-june-10-2019/4
---
Nope, can't hide it. But you could just not click the menu option for it?
---
 No way I am aware to hide it, but you do earn a decent amount of atoms in game.
---
"Throwin' those apples at ya! Appalachia Al!"
---
Yeah I like the dark vibe to it, wish I just could play for a bit before real life stuff asks for my attention again in 30 minutes.
---
Maybe you could read the other comments where I said I've already seen all his stuff.
---
It's only 4.68 on Xbox One X
---
Seems like I'm just another uncultured swine :)
---
Is there anywhere/place summarizing the patch notes since december?
---
Lol if you can‚Äôt control yourself around voluntarily spending money on virtual hats, then don‚Äôt even think about playing a game with microtransactions
---
Hello Angry Kitty.
---
Yeah, Tony Hawk got "Ring of Fire" for one of the Undergrounds back in the day. It's probably similar to what they did with "Country Roads", they had a cover done for a charity.
---
Dude, you wanna bully low level but complain when higher levels fuck with you? Man the fuck up, bitch.
---
That's true fair enough. Should be expected to hear same questions about it being broken though due to the state Bethesda launched the game in vs where it is/going now
---
The CAMP site you build on is only present when you are logged into the game. When you disconnect it disappears. If you selected a popular spot others might build there and you will see a prompt on logon that indicates a conflict. You can elect to find another, hopefully clear, server or continue to logon without your CAMP. The later doesn't delete your CAMP it just isn't present for that session.
---
No you cannot.  If you can't keep yourself from an atom shop, what keeps you from going completely unhinged and buying anything you can get your grubby fingers on?  Get real. Just have some control my dude.
---
Can you explain it to me then (instead of acting smug)? I‚Äôm ignorant to how it works I guess.
---
The first step is admitting you are powerless over the atomic shop and that your life has become unmanageable.
---
i just jumped in a few weeks a go.. looks like my timing was great.
---
been really enjoying it, and has a great/friendly community. the few gripes i do have, seem to be getting fixed this patch. *mainly the scope delay, that bugged me.
---
It's pretty much accessible anywhere inside the game. That being said, you can earn plenty of Atoms just from playing and doing the daily/weekly challenges.
---
IF THEY CAN KEEP FO76 GOING FOR A DECADE OR SO...
---
I played a couple hours upon release and wasn‚Äôt super in to it so i quit.  I‚Äôm coming back to try it out and I‚Äôll gladly drink whatever the fuck that is
---
I wonder if we need a certain amount of perception/charisma to get those options, but they just hid it so we wouldn‚Äôt know. Or maybe the amount we need will simply be unlisted or the option won‚Äôt show up if our stats are too low.
---
I'm wondering if additions to the CAMP building side of things will come along with Wastelanders in the form of plans from factions (ie. Raider/Settler).
---
They still need to drip feed content to make it last, so I wouldn't expect too much from Nuclear Winter other than costumes and skins, since that's what those crazy kids who like these BR games seem to like :)
---
But after that, yes - who knows? Maybe more thematic items, storage items and all that kind of good stuff. I've built at least a hundred and fifty camps now, I think and there's nothing new under the sun, as they say. I'm ready for more variety myself :)
---
I think you need a hug. And maybe a cookie.
---
Yet all your burns are overused and vanilla.
---
I'm not against trading, hell I do all the time, I am just worried about the propagation of duped super end game weapons / armors. 
---
It looks as if I am in the minority and I wont lose any sleep or go on a reddit tirade if they decide to keep them trade able. 
---
I would just like to see some harder to get items like many other mmo's have where you need teamwork and time to get something that very few can/do have and they can't be traded or dropped so you know they were earned.
---
Again just my take and wanted to see how others viewed it. Feel as I have gotten that answer after all the down-votes. I do appreciate your response!
---
Already available through the console store
---
I will not grant them the pleasure and hope of building up a life ;)
---
Fallout sub coming full force this morning
---
Obviously not as catchy as some form of ‚Äúdog‚Äù, but maybe have it be the Vault 76 Overseer? She is still alive isn‚Äôt she? I don‚Äôt remember anything saying she died. And she narrated the wastelander trailer.
---
It would make sense for her as well, wanting to corral and direct the wandering 76 dwellers. Could have her announce certain events.
---
Yeah fuck those guys for playing the game the way it was intended lol.  
---
Sorry they didn't suck them off while singing kumbaya ü§£
---
Ah shit, here we go again...
---
I think it will only be like that for the first 1-2 days (100% the first couple hours) but look around the map now and I never see many people in Lewisberg for Lying Lowe, not many people if any when I jump to the legendary vendor. The enclave quest line me and like 2 other people were doing it at the same time. A month later my friend started playing and nobody was around. It‚Äôs only going to seem crowded when every old player rushes to do it at the same time because it‚Äôs finally something new
---
No VATS = not playable for me.   
---
Ah well, I don't do PVP anyway.
---
None of that in the game
---
I would say "In hindsight," the opening should have been as you described, but honestly I was thinking it might be something like that before the game even got launched.  Namely, that the 20 or people per server were scouts sent out to find the overseer after she goes missing while the rest of the Vault stays safe inside. Eventually we'd resolve the main quest and make it safe for the rest of the vault to exit.
---
I was a bit surprised by the "You overslept and now everyone else has left" storyline that we got.
---
&gt;I‚Äôve always felt the radio is super lackluster because of how repetitive it is and it‚Äôs not in a set order so you could the same song 5 times within the hour.
---
I suspect a radio host will only make this issue worse, as you'll end up hearing the same dialogue potentially within the same hour. Radio hosts sound like a good idea but in the long run, unless they keep cranking out new voice lines for it, it'll just become one more thing we hear over and over and over again.
---
From where?
---
once you reach level 50, don‚Äôt be in a rush to choose a new perk card each time you level up because you may want to bank several level-ups in case you want to suddenly re-spec your SPECIAL.
---
Dawg\*
---
I think the hate is probably more due to disappointment at what bethesda promised vs what they released. Should of delayed launch by like a year lol
---
It's the best alcohol in the game. 
---
I won't spoil why that is, it's better to find out first hand.
---
server stability.. too many new players hammering all the servers...
---
Just don‚Äôt forget to do your side quests every now and then. I finished the main story line and found out I can‚Äôt be bothered completing side quests I should have done months ago.
---
Choices and consequences will be coming with the the wastelander update this fall. At this time to the best of my knowledge quests are linear and do not have irreversible choices as of right now.
---
I agree with your reasoning! I understand why but I think trading really helps this gsme
---
&gt;Your character‚Äôs Adventure Mode S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stats will determine which Perk Cards you can use.
---
How does it work for new players/characters? Their SPECIAL are just simply 1 across all attributes (+1 from first levelling up).
---
This is actually how they should implement server-wise notifications of events (like Pharma or Sheepsquatch).
---
Don‚Äôt want to know?  Turn off radio (or different station).
---
From the trailer, it almost looked like conversations are instanced just like ESO. We will see I suppose
---
this is true, good point
---
Once I went to the first overseer camp and dropped 750 rounds of 10mm and .45 with some food and a Nuka shine. I have them a fighting chance. Lol. They likely fast traveled back after 5 minutes.
---
unfortunatly - that boat has left the pier. (told you to set the alarm, but we all overslept)
---
i Like your ideas tho.
---
i wouldnt say there are such mistakes only thing is that quest rewards will be tied to your level so if you want to get the best versions of these weapons/armor you would need to start the questline at level 50
---
but to be honest most of them arent bad but you will find better legendary drops anyway so i wouldnt say theres a need to do it that way
---
other than that maybe try to plan your character build with the use of nukes&amp;dragons website 
---
you cant ruin your build forever but planning ahead could prove useful and spare you from a lot of xp grinding in the late game üëçüèº
---
Smart sloth
---
I need the swimmer one. People that offer to die for me are never on when I am
---
Can I link the pics for you ? In here
---
Step 2. Accept that there is a power greater than yourself. PRAISE ATOM!
---
Not really. You can always respec when you get to higher levels.  
---
The rewards you get for some quests are level-related so a lot of people suggest waiting until level 50 to do the quest "Mayor For a Day" as the reward for that is a really strong, lightweight melee weapon. Most of the other quest rewards you'll end up dumping as you level up anyways and find legendary weapons from enemies.
---
Keep doin you, Dad.
---
pretty new myself, but i don't think so.. especially for a trial period.
---
the game lets you create multiple characters anyway, so know you always have the option to experiment without too much consequence.
---
you'll just be exploring really. collect and scrap everything is the most common fallout rule  ;-)
---
hope you enjoy it :-)
---
I saw in one of Bethesda's articles that cosmetics and items unlocked for camps will be useable on all of your characters.
---
Prince needs to be set free from as well.
---
I wasn't really going to reply to anyone just read, but this comment needs more upvotes stat!
---
Be careful. Downvoters are lurking :)
---
it's nice to see that our SPECIAL stats come into play in the dialogue trees
---
Instead of waking up after a reclamation day party, new players could wake up/ be thawed out from a cryo chamber in a (possibly secret) lower floor with a separate set of recordings explaining that the first dwellers have been released already and have begun rebuilding.  Then they make their way to an elevator and go through the vault that we all went through, getting their perk cards, CAMP, etc.
---
It's just going to be short conversations about whether you'd like to do the quest to join their faction, with some SPECIAL checks along the way to open up options
---
Don't drop/scrap/sell your responder gear or firebreather gear, don't get rid of your mistress of mystery items, you can't get replacements without starting a new character.
---
well kudos to you for buying one 10mm bullet for 300 caps
---
You keep your special points but they don't really matter. You only get 1 perk card per special. It really just means that your special/perk cards are unique to each game mode so if you go back to adventure after a match of NW it will revert back to what you had.
---
Still no fixes for damage sponges that will eat so many bullets guns break before killing them.
---
Or the terrible enemy AI that just sees enemies walking toward you, eating bullets the whole way.
---
It takes more than animation tweaks, to make a game feel like a real shooter.
---
im not watching 28 minutes of that...
---
What time will it start?
---
I'm kinda hoping it is a simulation run by Zax.  It is difficult for me to imagine how this fits in with the story and timeline, and that whole thing of 52 of our fellow vault 76 colleagues just slaughtering each other for Overseer rank.... We are killing each other off more than rebuilding or helping this land.
---
I'm going to say they bring back a dupe glitch they previously patched, and have another 2 hour maintenance saturday morning.
---
Huh, so those Hellfire skins are in the Atom shop. I wonder if that means Hellfire is non-canon and just a skin you can put over your armor like the Horseman skins? Kinda hope thats not the case, but guess we'll see.
---
Sorry, I have one final question. There is something I read that confused me from official website:  
---
*However, there are some exceptions. For example, if you have pacifist mode disabled and return fire against another player you will become hostile toward them, meaning you will then take full damage from their attacks. Additionally, attempting to claim another player‚Äôs Workshop, or having someone else contest your own will open you up to hostility with that player. You can also still take damage from environmental hazards that may have been caused by another player, such as a car exploding.*
---
*With a future update, we‚Äôre currently planning to extend this protection to C.A.M.P. as well, which means your home base cannot be damaged by other players‚Äô attacks so long as you and your C.A.M.P. are not hostile toward those players. We‚Äôll have more details to share when we‚Äôre closer to implementing this change.*
---
So I know the update is out so your CAMP can't get trashed by other players... Workshops though is a free for all, which makes sense. My question is - 
---
\- What do you use Workshops for, crafting? If so, is this the only place to do crafting? Just worried about getting killed when crafting weapons.
---
Clogging weapons with bodies is the new meta and end game. Gather your noobs.
---
Sorry to hijack the comments OP i dont want to clutter the "new" section with noob questions, but as well as what OP is asking are there any weapon types that seem to be OP or any early gear in the game worth grinding for to make the levelling quicker? Looking to get my trials worth.
---
DONT EVER LOOK AT YOUR HANDS!
---
Like finding Cicero before you start the Dark Brotherhood in Skyrim! If you help him with Mother's wagon, he remembers it and talks about it once he gets to the base later.
---
Activating VATS now gives you Blight.
---
I‚Äôve heard they are adding additional modes though - possible we could get some in a future mode?
---
If only they put a reduced weight card for rifles in adventure/survival.. hmm one can wish I guess
---
I‚Äôm naked rn for the immersion aspect.
---
We‚Äôre all imptantient, but I get they don‚Äôt want to make any promises. It‚Äôs not like shoving a pizza in the oven and knowing it‚Äôs done in 12 minutes ;)
---
I have a 3* level 50 bloodied DCG. I don't say this to dampen your enthusiasm towards TUM, but mine has hit damage over 1300. Just wondering how this new addition is different other than in name only.
---
Yeah as a melee I think it's gonna be good for me because I can't aim for shit but I can smash things with my fists pretty good.
---
Not ones that have separate and already established monetization methods already in place.
---
Seems to depend on how large the jumps in times are between the yearly episodes (for lack of a better term.)   That introduces other problems (character age for one) but like any story "reasons" could always be introduced as an explanation.
---
Todd seemingly makes an apology statement or mea culpa every year.
---
I hope that next year is the year where he doesn't have to be self-deprecating about what they acknowledged they screwed up the previous year.
---
You will become the ruler of Appalachia once all of the wastelanders start worshipping you like a cult :P
---
As someone pointed out, it seems to happens when a server gets to the point of quitting. Happened to me Saturday night in Harpers ferry. However the glitch or whatever was beyond annoying. NOTHING could be killed with a projectile weapon, you could crit them to one hit point and they would just heal to full. I have to beat down every enemy, and the amount of legendary enemies was astounding. After about an hour of farming the server quit.
---
I will point out though, this particular server would not allow you in to Arktos Pharma, it gave the message that was prior to the DLC update.
---
dude get over it
---
side note: you dont need this shit anymore, so unless you're playing barbies, its cool to scrap it.
---
Well for one it's not hacking the game, you're modifying the files, hence why they're called "mods"
---
you can literally use the creation kit Bethesda themselves supply to create mods, if it was hacking Bethesda wouldn't supply the tools required to create mods now would they? though if you're genuinely calling mods hacks you sound like a salty console player that's mad over mods that are visual for the most part or just a small QOL change
---
Step 3: Turn your will and life over to a higher power. Let go and let Todd.
---
I appreciate it, and I do not want them to go the D3 route and remove all trading I miss those old auction houses. I guess if they could truly remove duping I wouldn't really have an issue with it at all. Cheers!
---
So being a toxic is your side hobby while you wait for updates?? And youre still commenting too but continuing to be a pathetic loser.
---
Love what they‚Äôve done with Wasteland for sure, but - and just whining here - would like a ‚ÄúLone Wanderer‚Äù rather than managed-party approach.
---
I went back and started FO2 recently which I think is what got we wondering about a 76 mode that‚Äôs closer to the baseline Fallout.
---
Waiting for that also...gonna wait a few days before testing to see what they break... guns not being there when returning to adv mod ? Who knows
---
Do you mean tool? I think you mean tool.
---
I miss 3-dog
---
They can't be used up. The enclave say it's an automated facility that keeps producing them.
---
Yeah, the combat improvements affect the whole game, of course.
---
What I mean is what it says in the patchnotes - that PvP in BR has been tweaked so that fights come down to skill (removal of VATS, for example).
---
I wish they did the same for Survival.
---
I can't find it either... bah.

He ain't alive yet
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm really excited for and glad I have some level ups saved. Want to see these new perks. Come on slugger melee aoe like fallout 4
---
It really is! And I wasn't going to even try for it but changed my mind as I figured I'd sell it... But I'm keeping it!
---
Abandoning the game now isn't an option for them, even if they wanted to, as it would make the bad press of launch seem like a drop in the ocean.
---
I forgot to mention it.
---
What would make me happy would be Fallout 5 not a shitty dlc for the shittiest fallout game.
---
No but if the shoe fits
---
&gt; craft almost everything from your CAMP without requiring resources -
---
I'm assuming you saw this written as fact somewhere? So what's to stop me from immediately making a full set of marine armor and a FIXER and a BOS sniper rifle? I guess that makes it ok, and I like it
---
Why would you post that tripe lol.
---
You better play or find a job rather than wasting your tacky creativity in whining against a game.
---
Good to know I'm not the only one...
---
Hey now, Dark Age of Camelot did the 3 faction MMO first, and did it best! That's exactly what the realm vs realm vs realm wars were about, and I would enjoy Survival more, if there was a purpose beyond shooting at people.
---
There are 5 types of raiders,then there are responders, BOS, and Free States. Seems like every other player would be a raider.
---
He's a sociopath for money. Emotionless betrayal as the only thing you do and upload to the internet....
---
He is the shit daniel guy from rust. Trolling is hilarious when its the guys entire personality.
---
I think they just mean 73 were added but some are only for nuclear winter. I could be wrong though and you have to earn them in BR first.
---
nothing im more free than u and less fat u mad hahahaha
---
Any Dev who want to take care of my issue?  
---
Someone can tag them?
---
Biggest mistake u can make is to try this game... Dont support it. let it die.
---
Oh that's right. Well then, looks like we'll just continue to nuke ourselves again and again... after all war never changes
---
Also add more song and decrease the likely of hearing the same song within minutes of each other. :)
---
I like this, but imagine it, a charismatic host who tells stories, and a cool, calm, or even rickety and shook host who likes playing music.  (Redeye and Travis Scott)
---
Go check out pylon v-13 and listen to the audio tape - I don't want to spoil it for you more then I may have.
---
How do I join? ;)
---
by asshole I don't mean I go around being mean to people I am nice.  but I don't like to wait for people , I like to go where I want when I want how I want, I don't sit around and chit chat I got to much to do in my limited gametime. so I am a bit offputting to normal people.
---
This sub is equally as delusional, just pulling in the other direction, lambasting any form of exterior criticism as ‚Äúirrational‚Äù hate
---
Feel free to add me then: ItsKuffi
---
Can also help you craft some sweet gear.
---
That I'm not sure about, but it's much easier to obtain than relying on the random Gods to drop one. If you do get it I think a side by side comparison would be really informative.  It only took about 20mins to get it
---
Just dont buy that game in the first place. Its bad and the Devs shouldnt get any more money with it.
---
Hopefully it's like the sims - you need a walkway in front of something to place it down, so itll place you there.
---
This dudes job is to shit on games. How sad
---
Only 20 minutes to go now!
---
They did a really good job of using the time to add things players are excited about. I stopped playing for about two months but honestly, the lack of any other game like it made me gravitate back to it, and it's much better. 
---
Im happy they are seemingly getting a second go at this
---
My guess would be that it‚Äôll be here for a week while they give it a test, and then they‚Äôll probably take it away and bring it back sometime soon
---
Im gonna stalk em and grab their bags when they die...yes im asshole i admit it
---
*sees cat*
---
You kept asking yourself if you couldn‚Äôt or could, you never stopped to ask if you should.
---
\+1 strength on a piece of armor increases your Strength stat by 1. It's as simple as that. Equip that piece of armor then look at your S.P.E.C.I.A.L stats in your Pipboy, you now have 1 more Strength. If you then unequip that piece of armor your Strength stat returns to the original value.
---
Unless you have a lot of scrip saved up eg. 800+ and already some very good 2\* or 3\* weapons, I would go for 2\* weapons every time. You get more rolls (its only 50 scrip per roll) and therefore a higher chance of getting a weapon you'd want to use (or possibly trade for one you'd want to use).
---
But, with armor its a different story. 3\* Armor only costs 60 scrip per roll, and the first and third effects on a piece of armor are usually the most important ones (eg. unyielding + sentinel, bolstering + weapon weight) so 3\* rolls are the best option for armor.
---
In any case, I think its better to save up your scrip for a few days and then spend it all at once, instead of doing 2-3 rolls per day, as sometimes you will see repeating primary (eg. bloodied, anti-armor) or secondary effects (eg. explosive, +25% fire rate) over the course of several sequential rolls. So if this does happen, you'll want to keeping rolling until you run out of scrip. If it doesn't or the repeating effects are unfavourable ones (eg. +40% bashing damage), then you could quit, save some more scrip and come back another day, or keep going as you're still likely to get at least one decent weapon if you roll enough times.
---
Eh I see the Brotherhood more like a raider gang than a government faction
---
Most of it is irrational.
---
Thx friend update the post.
---
Lmao I love the main thread on that mod, the dude saying he‚Äôs considering reporting the creator to the ‚ÄúFederal Authorities‚Äù and everyone else telling him to piss off.
---
... More... Also means there can be less...
---
No problem! Thank you!!
---
I have the same fear. :/
---
For the first few hours I'll just use a new character and check reddit tomorrow to see if people lost their stuff.
---
You got fanboyed for speaking the truth üòÇ
---
Server is down for maintenance so I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre currently preparing for server overload, and will then make it full f2p
---
it's been a tough run. Not gonna lie. 15 perk points, locked in...
---
So, in order to be able to use these perk cards I have to play BR? It seems there will be no other way to access these cards.
---
Go check Bethesda and Fallout's Instagram pages... Every comment there will give you radworms. Like heck, even scorchbeast's fart attack is more civil than instagrams bethesda community ü§Æ
---
It's funny that you mention pizza.  I was thinking about my days as a pizza delivery driver as I read through these threads today.
---
That's when I learned about managing expectations.  You call and order a pizza, and you expect them to tell you when it'll be there.  But the thing is, that's an unreasonable expectation.  The people working there are not clairvoyant.  They don't know how long it'll take.  They give you a rough idea of how long it will probably take, based on an educated guess.  Depending upon the employee you talk to, that guess could be more educated or less.  
---
Managing expectations is a crucial part of the process.  Let's say that we can look into the future and we know that we're talking to someone whose pizza will be there in one hour.  They ask how long it will take.
---
If we tell them it will take an hour, *most* people are fine with that.  As long as they know beforehand it'll be an hour, they'll wait without complaint.  An hour later you have a happy customer.
---
If we tell them it will take 30 minutes, they'll be pissed when it's late.  An hour later you have an unhappy customer.
---
If we tell them it will take 90 minutes, *most* customers will be pleasantly surprised that you're early.  An hour later you may have a very happy customer.
---
So here you have the same experience, the same delivery time, but three different levels of customer satisfaction.  The only thing that changed was their expectations.
---
But in truth, the people at the pizza joint do not know the future.  Anything they tell you is a guess that may or may not be correct.  If you base your mood and your satisfaction on a task that is literally impossible (seeing the future), you're only setting yourself up for frustration when your expectations aren't met.
---
The point?   It's lunchtime and I'm hungry.  I want pizza.
---
Not live yet. Severs still under maintenance.
---
You don't care to use mods yet you call them hacks and make it seem like people are villains for installing optional modifications to make their game look different to yours, so what if I want all my scorched to be Todd Howard? or for my pip boy to be filtered so I can actually see what I have? it doesn't effect you in the slightest and sure as fuck doesn't give me an advantage that ACTUAL hacks like ESP, Aimbot and so on do
---
Again, this is a video game.  It‚Äôs made to let you do whatever you want. There‚Äôs ways that are made into the game to let you avoid certain things that you don‚Äôt like. Use them.
---
What. I'm flooding in water and food from looting corpses I kill. I can't eat everything before it spoils. Water and Hunger are not an issue at all
---
Rad worms strength buff FTW
---
probably at around the same time as the new updates go live
---
I think this was planned from the start
---
They‚Äôve been doing a great job in both fixing bugs and adding new contents. Still buggy but night and day difference from the game six months ago. If they suddenly bring out 200 hot skins for the weapons I use I‚Äôll be very broke.
---
Not going to bother. BR sucks and is over.
---
chill out wtf
---
With the new game mode using our existing characters are we now going to see BGS use admin tools to replace lost items when the inevitable bugs cause shit to disappear?
---
Sent you a request dudeüòé
---
&gt;Finally a proper skill-based game mode.
---
Well I'm out.
---
I'm more excited for the anti materiel rifle they showed in the other trailer.
---
And the map visibility changes in survival as well. You're not wrong that it is a pvp-focused mode; it's just not the \*only\* one, nor is PvP the only thing to do in that mode.
---
They're just gonna jump to wherever or whatever's gonna give them karma and feed their echochamber. 
---
"FO76 BR BAD!!!!!" is a hot karma farming trope at the moment so they have to cash in. Saw a post yesterday literally saying Beth should stop making all contents (that's exactly what the post said) and fix every minor bug one by one for a year or two. I actually felt like I lost half my brain cells reading it.
---
Very good point. I was keeping it brief because as much as I'd like to help I'm quite lazy üòÅ
---
Sounds fun!
---
It sounds like it‚Äôs independent of the game modes. The new perk selection menu is specific to BR though.
---
Naw, never been to that place. Been here since Beta. But you should know the pattern by now. Emergency patch in 2 to 3 days. Something unexpected always goes sideways. And as another poster stated...one of those things tends to be a duping technique or previously fixed issue that gets reintroduced.
---
Hell ya just got it
---
Do I see a Plasma Caster?!
---
We'll find out soon
---
*" Nuclear Winter Pre-Beta Sneak Peek will be available for play until June 17.  "*
---
If some of the new perk cards are simply 3 star lock picking/hacking....that would be pretty great.
---
Anyone hav
---
Well I'm stuck at 6/7 photos. Game frooze a few hours later, back to 1/7...I just want some quest and a backpack.
---
Oh, so you know the exact time the trial stops?
---
&gt; Wonder how a lvl 2 would fare in the Cranberry bog with no caps and nothing but a party hat?
---
Fast travel back to Vault 76 is always free, so if nothing else, they won't be trapped.
---
Some time free is better than no time free
---
If you have friends in the game which can supply you with a very good under armour that can help a lot at low lvls. The high end under armour items give high stat bonuses which do make a decent bit of difference, especially at low level before you can get your paws on really good armour pieces. You can also try to find people willing to help you craft and/or upgrade your weapons. Higher dmg receivers for guns and the like. Higher lvl players will have unlocked -a lot- of crafting recipes for those weapon upgrades.
---
No problem!
---
The reason he/she is getting downvoted is because of the unnecessary negativity.
---
It will divide the community and allow for proper teams to form in the wastes, I can't wait for the "large"-scale battles between raiders and settlers.
---
not counting chickens until they've hatched. I'll wait and see how this new content pans out, but I have this sinking feeling, that it will be more of being led around with a ring thru the nose.
---
I think like how many points you have in a certain special will determine what cards you can choose in vault 51.  There will be special level requirements maybe. Just my thoughts.
---
It was a great summary! (Also, drink ALL the Nukashine). A lot to new players seem to be really worried about PvP, so that‚Äôs why I chimed in. :)
---
I like this idea
---
If you can't find the other threads about this, there's no way you'll find your way out of Vault 76.
---
I'm more hyped about the plasma caster than the whole NPC deal.
---
I'm just trying to find where to try this free trail with my friends too but omg, chill out.
---
Wow my bad. That wording was terrible on my part. This should be better. One card is allowed for each tree. I.e one card in strength, one card in agility and so on. You cant have 5 strength cards. Just one. There are new perks for this mode some of witch do not carry over some that do.
---
The game is rated M though? Kids shouldn't be playing it.
---
Dang, i really needed that /s
---
Commenting because I am also waiting to go live. I haven't played in a few months and I'm excited for this update!
---
It‚Äôs also super easy to earn most of them, they‚Äôre not super greedy with them
---
Whoops! Too late. I'm supporting it! And so is my wife. And also her brother. Oh well... :p
---
Can‚Äôt wait to hear what they do with the voice acting.
---
Punch bowl? Sorry, I just bought the game recently.
---
the game is labelled 18+ for a reason, fuck off
---
Yup.
---
Just trying to offer a different point of view here, not looking to start drama, im not about that life.
---
My only experience with 76 is the beta sessions before launch, im a big fallout fan and whilst i certainly did get the Fallout feels playing the beta the game was, to me anyway, unplayable.
---
Bugs were rampant and optomization was awful and being so close to launch i decided to hold out on buying it. Then the reviews happened and all the press catastrophes. 
---
This stopped me form purchasing the game and if you try to look at the 76 launch from a non biased point of view i think everyone can admit it was a shambles. Since then i have always had the temptation to buy fallout 76 i just didnt want to buy a full priced game that has the controversy that 76 has. For me a game should never launch in that condition and i think during Bethesda's E3 conference they admitted fault and it was actually refreshing to see.
---
So, now im here with my One X stuck to the store page waiting for this trial. This is a big moment for the game in my opinion, this is going to be alot of peoples "second first impression" if you know what i mean, im probably massively overestimating the importance of this trial but i feel if they pull this off correctly fallout 76 might just become bigger than anyone ever thought. Im looking forward to see how far the game has come and what there is to experience.
---
I saw the Anti-Material Rifle and literally almost died.
---
When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east. When the seas go dry and mountains blow in the wind like leaves.
---
I have the game, and 120 hours, this is my one chance to convince people that its actually GOOD. Answer the question
---
This is the gist of my complaints for the past month. Adventure mode doesn't even run smoothly. I'm not going to invest a lot of energy into a BR mode only to have to deal with the usual bugs when I'm in the top five after 30 mins of game play.
---
Actually, I'll post a link in a sec.... Feeling generous.
---
Twist, he was a ghoul the whole time
---
Skins, collars, costumes... camp items for them.. dog beds, dog houses.. the options are endless
---
You are correct about DAoC sir, but seeing as it's in the same corporate umbrella figured more people would be familiar with ESO.
---
Survival definitely needs some tweaking. Now that they have a Battle Royale Survival needs to focus more on Surviving the world, not other players. They need to make the food/water/sleep more meaningful. They also need to have MORE enemies almost like swarms or waves that literally consume parts of the map. Also, they need more reasons to play the mode the extra XP and weekly is a start but they need more.
---
No nukes for a day (except for the lucky player that manages to not have the game crash when they enter the silo).
---
It's only for PVP, confirmed by Bethesda. You can still use VATS on creatures in Nuclear Winter.
---
When Todd pushes the button.
---
Have sex.
---
A lot of those bugs were things most people would never actually encounter.
---
They started on 10am EDT
---
It's weird coming to game subs and watch fans dismiss reality. I watched my brother play and he had to reset 5 times In two hours. Anthem still sucked but for slightly more competent reasons
---
Probably. Although I had a level 50 character with an explosive combat rifle attempt to take my settlement from me. He hid in the bathroom and killed me, I quickly respawned to find him. I was level 5 at the time so I knew I didn't have much of a chance, I chased him up a hill and killed him with my pipe rifle with only a sliver of health left. I basically hit the jackpot because he had 150lbs worth of junk on him that I took
---
That's what you say, but it hasn't happened yet, so not what you actually know.
---
Alright, Thanks :)
---
So you haven‚Äôt played it recently huh?
---
Nice this means we are getting close to servers being back up!
---
How is survival mode? Are higher level players just rolling over everyone or does it work more like a traditional fps?
---
I completed the 3 badges and when talked to the bot it took the 3 badges and I am not seeing anything to craft.
---
 I only have the plus 60 carry weight back pack and nothing else. 
---
  Am I missing something or do I need more badges.
---
Gotta wonder if it'll be an entirely new weapon or simply a new 'Caster' extended barrel for the Gatling Plasma. Speaking of weapons, the person with the sledge on their back seems to be holding an [oooold Fallout weapon](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Gauss_pistol_\(Fallout_2\)).
---
You‚Äôll be destroyed by the teams of cloaked one shotters!!!!
---
Wait WHEREE
---
The game is 18+
---
Haha as soon as you posted this I saw this message on startup
---
Didn‚Äôt even start toxic, you just get extremely triggered. Also, try to spice up your insult game, the repetition of ‚Äúpathetic loser‚Äù ‚Äúdbag‚Äù and ‚Äúno life‚Äù are just so overused they carry no weight anymore. Like I‚Äôve nicknamed you Colt after the gun, seeing as how easily triggered you are getting.
---
went live at 10 EDT, so presumably within this next hour
---
God damn are we entitled!
---
Yeah, yeah I'm stupid, now please link me.
---
I pretty sure the game is rated to not be played by kids at all.
---
That red ‚ÄúIt just works‚Äù button?
---
Isn't game already rated 18+ for being mature content game? 
---
It should filter kids at least from developer responsibility perspective...
---
Yeah it's annoying that their website is full of "Play Now" buttons but they all just link to the store to buy it...
---
Its what I said.....
---
Perfeect. Thank you!
---
takes long
---
I don‚Äôt have kids but I respect parents, children, and their families. If I encounter inappropriate adult behavior I joyfully report them. there‚Äôs no place for those types.
---
Its really not that hard to stay fed, there's animals every where and now with player vending - farms are open to everyone and a lot of people leave their water purifiers open. I never run out of food or water. It's really not that hard to manage - even with speed demon mutation which makes it drain faster.
---
It‚Äôs been there forever, it wouldn‚Äôt be fallout without it
---
Thank you for being open about it. One of my main subs I follow has the most toxic opinions on this kind of thing. Ive had to unsubscribe a couple times so im glad this is a safehaven for people with actual reasonable opinions.
---
I can see that point of view. But remember if the Brotherhood shows up at all it will be an offshoot of the main branch. Likely lead by a leader who differs slightly from the main branch.
---
It's not a pointless clock. It has buffs and debuffs. There're weapons and perks that depend on it. And most importantly it's not a chore at all. You get food and water everywhere and it takes 10 seconds to eat and drink like once per hour.
---
If this is the main issue that's throwing you back from playing then pretty sure you're just another poor soul who only played the game on kotaku or youtube. I'm not mad at all if you leave, go ahead. I for one won't be missing any troll
---
I'd be thrilled if they made it stop (longer) to accommodate download etc.
---
Usually its approximately 2ish hours. Sometimes sooner, Sometimes later.
---
Let me know if [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J17VBKufomM77fAjUjdnC1-wr_THgTsa/view?usp=drivesdk) works.
---
Yeh mate they where there thanks for that I can finish the challenge now.
---
We at The Church of Lootcifer will see you. We will allow this "Woobie" creature to... exist... for now. When the time comes though, for all times must come. You must step aside to allow The Interloper to walk the earth.
---
game is rated mature 17+
---
omg my calendar says it's the 10th - I missed a whole day, lol
---
Kids should 100% not be playing adult games. 
---
The ratings are there for a reason. If you let your kid play an adult game, then that's on you, but you (presumably) wouldn't sneak your kid into an adult movie...
---
# We need the punch bowl back!!
---
Yeah, I mean I know there's an emote but that emote wheel is kinda clumsy. I still prefer the flashlighty teabag crabwalk dance, myself.
---
oh it's live now then. Wait no that's just the phycobuff kicking in
---
I'm thinking when this pre-BETA is over, June 17th.
---
Again, video games are played by real life people. All this one does is troll and harass people with his emotionless voice and terribly lifestyle. He posts it online, repeat. You can still bring your sociopathy into a game world.
---
It's not made to do whatever you want. The OP even posts his video where he's literally walking on air (without power armor jetpack yadayada) so hes a cheater too. Literally not allowed in the game. 
---
This is just reddit, where i can do whatever I want then too. Praise me for it sociodaddy.
---
Caps, xp and earned cosmetics come back with you. If you find a submachine gun during a match, it won't come back with you.
---
I'm currently downloading the trial on PS4, NA.
---
So around noon. Beautifuly said.
---
It's the 10th actually
---
If you are this concerned don't buy your children an online 17+ video game where you play with other adults....and you know what? In my 400 hours of playing this game since beta, the only people saying rascist predatory, sexist, or just plain fucked up things on mic have been children.
---
I agree with most of your points but except for the choice and consequences because of the absence of the ability to save/load. I don‚Äôt know how the Wastelanders DLC will work, but it happened to me multiple times that I accidentally hit a Whitesprings bot while helping them fight against ghouls/other invaders or agroed them by sprinting past them in Power Armor with the Pain Train perk equipped. 
---
Making these mistakes irreversible would break the game for me and I suspect many others.
---
Yeah same question. The website says "Play Now" but the links just take you in a circle... I installed the launcher but it just goes to the store page.
---
Dont place concrete foundations in water.
---
I get 2007
---
I hope people get the full 7, that would be nice.
---
"wait, you guys are getting paid?"
---
Epic gamer moment üòéüëä
---
Preach it, brother.
---
doing your job as a parent is the system...
---
No. I expect them to release a visual roadmap of Nuclear Winter DLC and detailing each content's release order first; similar with what they did with Wild Appalachia DLC
---
I know. I was going off of adventure mode
---
there really arent any.
---
The only thing id say is, dont put a lot of stock in your build until after you hit level 50 and can move your SPECIAL points around and buy additional cards/card levels. Stick to using the perk cards that will help the most at the low levels, and know that leveling after 50 is quick to unlock the build you actually want for end game.
---
But i suck.... how am I supposed to hit anything.
---
Yup, should be next to the "new features button". No hate, I absolutely adore this game.
---
Monster fish?!?!?! Ok but pls let it be Travis, love that guy.
---
Wkrp on Appalachia!!!!!
---
THE BOX SAY'S 18.
---
your KIDS are online with 20/30 odd other humans !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
ARE YOU STUPID
---

I mean, I too think this "only seeing the username for the account, instead of the character" is just bad design, but protecting your kids from online experiences you don't think is safe, in any context? The line is one person long and starts and ends with \_you\_.

How am I making people a villain? I‚Äôm not sure why you‚Äôre so triggered, I‚Äôm just asking for why they aren‚Äôt considered hacks? IN A NON NEGATIVE WAY. I‚Äôm done with this thread because you are just way too aggressive to have a discussion with.

Really depends on your play style. If you like to run up to enemies and turn them into a grease stain on the pavement, then shotguns work really well. If you spec high into strength (which you probably will for the bonus carry weight) then melee can dish out bone liquifying hits. If you are more of the long range, every shot counts type, then a lever action, handmade, or rifle will be your skull piercer of choice.

I'm just waiting for some little shits mommy or daddy to complain that little Timmy was verbally abused in-game and is now suffering from mental health issues due to all the bad people calling him names and killing him all the time. Then some big news site/government shill/politically correct dimwit will moan/complain and say how bad games are for the youth of today and should be banned for teaching kids to kill and be mean to other kids etc etc. All the while we sit here shaking our heads wondering why little Timmy's mom and dad bought the little fuck a mature rated game and a headset to communicate with total strangers...GG dip shit GG :D

It worked for me now, but I had to restart the launcher

Self fulfilling prophecy?
---
Why don't you spend some time on it rather than already throwing in your 2 cents. It's a sneak peak in BETA, go enjoy it or don't.
---
I'm not the same person, and survival mode flopped because no real work was put into it.
---
And I'm not even gonna comment to whether Ive played fallout games as you're just needlessly gate keeping.
---
I think there's alot of people sitting on pins and needles waiting I'm constantly refreshing and trying,lol

EX MACHINA
---
Helping the squeakers is so much fun, though! They get so excited.
---
Try again. I changed a setting
---
This is my opinion and will change with the combat balencing today. It was fun at first but the rewards are not great. Its meant to be more of a challenging mode. Which it is. Higher levels that have their build right can rick roll you. But I have dropped level 100+ with my level 20 pistol nerd. You just got to get the drop on them. Its the fallout world, but with PvP. Gunfights were very onesided in most cases.
---
Hasn't played it, already saying what to do to make it "better".
---
How would you know without super powers or time travel?
---
I dont have high hopes any of this will happen.. nor am I sure I would want it to...
---
Ya just showed up for me! 50 min download thought lol
---
Like a real life Fallout mission whooaaa
---
it is, I just got the popup and my friend is literally downloading. He had the install option, Im just seeing buy now
---
I'm glad that VATS is not going to be used against people here. I don't like using it, and in a mode like this it would inherently put anybody not using it at a disadvantage. It seems like this is also surprisingly focused on PvE, if we get to fight scorchbeasts and other monsters. I wonder how many of the player deaths will actually be due to other players here
---
Well thats just how YouTube is, the majority of any given comment section is just people fishing for likes. Reddit pages and official forums are generally better places to get genuine negative feedback. Rather than just "lol fortnite am i right?" posts.

Patch notes today say it all takes place in the Forest.

I really wish we had more incentive to visit other people‚Äôs camps, I feel like it‚Äôs a lot of caps to get there just to see that it‚Äôs some crap house they put next to no effort into; or a wanna be death trap etc,

Edit: not to mention the over priced crap on the vending machine itself
---
omg I can finally purchase 3 star armor now
---
Well survival sounds like the way to go for you then. I've never played ark. The only things you could steal from players camp would be crops and water or any resources from the resource generators. But when you die in survival you drop aid items and junk so no weapons or armor can be taken from other players. Hope you have a great time this week and decide to stay. Good luck out there. üëç

It's Free now, Installing/Downloading on PC right now.

That makes sense.

Yes and the wonderful players that put nukashine in the punch bowl contributed to many great adventures.

If your little kid is playing an M rated game you have fucked up. There's some messed up concepts in Fallout and some teens saying the f word is the least of your worries lol

Bringing the Brotherhood back would retcon the lore even more. I accepted the satellite story but with that down and all the Appalachian BoS members dead there is no good explanation why an organization sitting in a bunker on the other side of the continent would show up all of a sudden out of nowhere.

People said free wknd starts at 1 a.m. (Moscow)

Why do you think team damage is an option?

Wholesome

Game is now available to install in Bethesda Game Launcher.

Look for the leader of the pack event. The alpha wolf you kill at the end usually drops a low level legendary item.
---
ESRB...nuff said
---
I was guarding the chief while launching a nuke and a lvl 46 assaultron ate about 500 rounds of 5mm from a gatlin like they were Skittles, taking absolutely no damage in the process. Long story short, I had to spawn at some random ass lookout tower about 19 caps away from site Charlie and make my way all the way back inside... Low on ammo of course
---
Either you farm the mass in another zone, or your nuke zone includes burrows, rocket shop and treetops house, with some luck, RR will be with ghouls (mutants are more common but hardly drop mass)
---
You eventually get to a point where you just have so many levels banked. I completely re did my points twice last night and still have 25 levels saved.
---
See the immersion of three dog made me feel like the wasteland was watching me and judging my actions which i liked, but ol stuttery balls in 4 just bugged me so i turned him off...the wife says I'm good at that.
---
Then I can type what I want about it without you hating on it. Don't you see the irony?
---
You'll grow up one day.
---
Yeah, maybe don‚Äôt let your kids play a game that was intended for adults. It‚Äôs a simple solution, but it‚Äôll save you the headache and worrying about your child being exposed to adult themes in an adult game.
---
Maybe teammates will be excluded from the VATS restriction? They said AI mobs would still be subject to VATS.
---
Yes folk role play, everything from bounty hunters to raiders to medics dressed in surgical scrubs running into an event and stimpack-ing all the fallen, to crafters like me, a wasteland witch doctor that sells a lot of disease cures through the player vending machines amongst other things, player vending is great btw, you see gun shops, power armour mechanics, all sorts really. As for loot if a player dies they drop their junk in a brown paper bag and it‚Äôs open to anyone who sees it to take it. In adventure mode it is just junk that is dropped and if you attack a player and they chose not to shoot back you do them 0 damage and they do not die. There are no such restrictions in survival mode and players drop junk and aid items when killed. As far as camps go they cannot be looted as there is no loot to pick up but they can be destroyed if you and the player are hostile to each other e.g engaged in PVP with one another.
---
Add to that: can I ‚Äúsacrifice‚Äù one character to grinding Nuclear Winter, and have all the cosmetics and gear I unlock available to my non-nuclear winter characters, or do I have to grind it individually?
---
I based my damage off the level 50 version, I've got a lot of those.
---
Having played NV, 4 and now this on  the so-called "hardcore mode"... it's no different.
---
If it bothers you... there's a ton of endurance perks that pretty much make it all but vanish. One of my characters drinks from puddles and rivers and eats people. Never need to hunt, cook or carry any of that stuff.

BREAKING NEWS
---
Thanks so much for this, and your investment in time, both OP and Bethesda!
---
There is SO much investment in creativity that I see from Bethesda that it almost hurts me to complain about bugs.. The Easter eggs just keep this series SOO interesting to play and re-play. That is commitment!
---
I would ask how are the dev teams are structured? I feel there is a core team that writes the new features, and then another group that fixes the bugs.. I say this because I see a repeating cycle, the first release of new content generally is VERY stable with no crashing and It's the "fixes" that are killing the stability, and thus the reputation of the game/company. If it's the same group that wrote the original new content, then I think they are being pressured to "fix" these items too fast, maybe by the business side? I've worked in pressured scenarios as this and understand it. If it is the biz pushing for the speed of the "fixes", I'd hope they would loosen up because it's  what is killing the rep of the great developers at Bethesda that deserve so much better.
---
How old are you? Does mommy know you're using the internet again?
---
I‚Äôve definitely been there in Whitesprings bots! How about a timed penalty instead, like Diseases work now, that imposes a consequence during your ‚Äúrecovery‚Äù from the ‚Äúnear death‚Äù experience?
---
Thanks, yeah downloading now.
---
Everything in NW is standalone, save for the cosmetics you can unlock for main game. 
---
As you earn experience in NW you can level up your Overseer Rank. With higher ranks you unlock more. I‚Äôm not sure the full mechanics but a level 1 and a level 50 will be on completely even playing fields going in for the first time.
---
My bunny compound may have to be converted to a cat compound. I adore all the camp items so much.
---
My post comment is coming up as removed for me so not sure if the thread is gone or not, but what I said in the first post was 
---
"I'm guessing this thing takes a day to install for people, and isn't out yet, so.....
---
I'm happy for all the new players and very excited for the BR but I just feel like people are not going to get near a full week."
---
oh like atom challenges?
---
yes, the semantics of ‚Äú18+‚Äù is cool and all but it isn‚Äôt reality- underage kids are present and they‚Äôre not going anywhere. unfortunately, systems will likely change to accommodate.
---
it‚Äôs like many other things in life- the presence of children ruins it for the rest of us.
---
Welllll let‚Äôs be honest, it was hot garbage on release. If for no other reason than stability/bugs. I still played to 50, but just came back for wild Appalachia and am 131 already and loving it.
---
Can we get this in compound versions I wonder?
---
I'm sure they do, but I'm also sure they are constantly using chems and probably don't think about what's in those cookies when handing them out.
---
Which* lol
---
But good explanation!
---
Only 7 of them are tied to the BR mode, the others can be used outside of it...we just don't know if they can be accessed or chosen outside of BR if you haven't played BR to unlock them.
---
So if the Raider Cage armour comes as a separate outfit and helmet... I‚Äôm gonna wear the Elder Battlecoat and Raider Cage Helmet to resemble the NCR as closely as possible
---
I know what you mean. Hate mobbing seems to be something that is inescapable now in many different aspects of life.
---
Theres constructive criticism and then theres shitting on something becuase you want to part of the outrage, at that point its not sincere and it helps no one.
---
Glad to see that 76 seems to be recovering. I even tgink just having human NPCs would be enough to bring a good ammount of players in on its own.  Its good that they havent done an "Anthem"and that they still have alot of hopes resting on this Title.
---
yep, daily challenges to get atom points, some you have to take a pic of someone in responder gear or complete an event with them to get the points
---
My thought was maybe the compound version might be a weapon mod? But you‚Äôre probably right, it‚Äôs probably a separate item entirely
---
hah, didn't think of that.  Downloading now.
---
I didn't say they were bad...it's just all those games weren't fun.  Online multiplayer simply is not fun or enjoyable.  I've tried a ton of different games over the last 15-20 years and absolutely none were as enjoyable as single player or local split screen multiplayer.
---
Sorry to tell you, but normal police uniform counts as responder, which you find in Morgantown airport
---
Then why would they say that adventure mode SPECIAL stats affect which perk cards you can use?
---
I‚Äôve already installed, servers are down for maintenance.
---
Still nothing for the Xbone. :/
---
Im just happy that they are focusing on trying to excite their already existing players instead of harvesting in new leavers :)
---
Haha piss off. I've been for as long if not longer than you. I didn't follow a guide for my build, and it took ages to get it to where I am now, and I'm still streamlining it. 
---
Every other post on here is someone moaning about getting killed in PvP lol. Bloodied is extremely risky in both PvP and pve, and you should be able to one shot people as a result of the build. One shot, one kill, one shot back and you're killed too. That's the trade off. There are weapons that counter the build easily, and it's not my fault or anyone else's that you can't counter it, and getting upset because someone said something mean to you in a game is utterly feeble.
---
r/woosh sorry :(
---
No one knows yet since the servers are still down.
---
Definitely. Reddit is Facebook just full of intelligent people. Hopefully people do try the game and actually give honest feedback instead of hopping on the hate train like sheep
---
Thank you for calling me genius. This being said, let me rephrase this: your cut-up header is crass, and you should be ashamed of yourself  to produce such blatant poor taste production. Many thanks.
---
No, servers are not up yet... at least for me on PC, Eastern US.
---
This is what I mean! We need to ‚Äòshine these unwashed masses
---
The bear costume looks amazing
---
That would be really neat but probably not yet but here's hoping for some planters in the future - especially since we already have some in the game like the ones in the Vault Tech Ag center!
---
Because it's where they belong.  I'm fine with raiders playing in survival (because I play adventure).  Hell, I wish all the raider wannabes played in survival.
---
Yea finally, and I get downvoted and insulted when complaining about vats and invisibility around here lol. Now we finally get a skill relevant game mode, no camping on rocks and one shotting everyone using vats because they can't spot you lol
---
I‚Äôll be at the mercy of my hotel üò¨

Aaah ok. Sorry, am at work and super excited over this change.

It was your free ticket from my base to somewhere
---
You sad was a good game, your opinion doesn't make a game bad for everyone
---
hoard less.. spend more..
---
I would rather see a 200lb account wide global mailbox than an increase to stash...
---
The game is down for maintenance at the moment. The expectation is the trial should be available after. 
---
I would expect about an hour from now.

legit, and the other half of the coin is parents. its on them too.

Me too.

"I haven't played forever, but I know that it's been a mess since launch"
---
Pffft. You do you, man.
---
During one of the wild appalachia updates they kicked me out of my camp location and I still can't figure out why. None of the quests I've seen takes you to where I was, so I just figure they'd block a big area for Vault 51 too
---
Is treat in the patch notes? I‚Äôll go take a look.
---
Lucky you! I have shitty internet and am download it at 2MB/s. 8 hours for me hahaha
---
Yo dog.... I'll stop here.
---
I'm not saying that's what happened. I genuinely believe that it was deleted out of your inventory. 
---
It's happened to me from my stash as well, but loads of people victim blame so to speak because any negative criticism is seen as blasphemy lol.
---
I used to feed the noobs till I went into trade with a lvl 5 only to see it was obviously a mule because he had nothing except high end legendary weapons in his inventory.
---
The music is giving me serious Skyrim vibes, makes me want to actually give Skyrim a try.
---
you can download it, but wont be able to play until the servers come live as they are updating the game now.
---
Tell them if they hear or see a warning about a nuke being launched they must rush and stand inside the red circle .... it is the only safe area on the map !!

Indeed and here in the U.K. it‚Äôs rated PEGI 18 for audiences aged 18 years or over:

Yeah, it's called game websites and youtube.

&gt;Pffft. You do you, man.
---
Always love interacting with fanboys.
---
Got to admit the opening left me with a bad taste in my mouth from the get go. It was way to slap-stick for me. Then the emotes, poses, and outfits - maybe I‚Äôve been watching my 12 yo play too much Fortnite but I was seeing a whole lotta similarities...
---
Ooops, allow me to clarify! You can craft almost any CAMP object to build your camp. They said the exception was obvious stuff like turrets, which will be lootable objects.
---
&gt;aren't all that critical of the devs, our criticism lies with the people up the chain
---
All of the issues in one line.---\^ You can't make a game like this work without REAL talent!
---
No. Each match your character goes back to level 1 with 1 in each SPECIAL and a level up to start. This is so that everyone always starts on an even playing field.
---
You do gain the Overseer XP like they said, however.
---
I would be happy either way they add it in.  It might just be too OP with how good str builds are already... but I won't be complaining. 
---
*Visualizing bows in power armor*
---
You are safe from us. For me at least the Free Trial link just leads to a payment page not a download. :(
---
I think Bethesda is trolling us wannabes
---
Most likely when the maintenance is over.
---
PC and PS4 people are able to download. This is lame
---
oh well.
---
I guess I'll just buy some ato......*SLAP*
---
Sorry, I almost got away from myself there.
---
Makes as much sense as the Cryolator being in Appalachia when it was supposed to be a prototype weapon unique to Vault 111
---
FFS people stop asking this question over and over.. use common sense man. The server isn‚Äôt even up so wouldn‚Äôt you assume it‚Äôs when you can actually play.
---
Strangely enough, it could totally explain why we instantly die in power armor when jumping inside a fissure, it's just too much for the suit to handle.
---
Coming as an atom shop prop called "Hoarders of Appalachia " same section as the repair kits.
---
I'll give you 10min. bet you've hit the 1000lb already.
---
Hahaha no.  No you cannot.  You need a friend or a second console to do it yourself.
---
...you know what the entire point of this series is, right?
---
I guess they could make a jail/fine system like in Skyrim where you would have to pay a certain amount of caps if you break the rules (shoot someone). Jail time could be replaced by getting banished for 30 minutes IRL since you can‚Äôt skip time in online servers.
---
Sounds like they're fucked unless they level up,  right?
---
Maybe he wants you to find him old records or tapes of music and comedy/drama shows and they're scattered across the map but really hard to find and are based on the month? Like October: Monster Mash, Dracula/werewolf/mummy radio shows, and that sort of thing?
---
OMG YES. My favorite gun in all of Fallout is coming. It's the reason I spec in rifles.
---
And how would I know that if I don‚Äôt play the fucking game. Hope the majority of the community is as toxic as you.
---
Yep, but I want to know how much XP you get per game. I want to know if its a good alternative to the mob grind.
---
Why ?
---
hope its good, and hopefully it will be like kinda DayZ Mod style BR.
---
NEW PLUSHIES, AHHHH.
---
I played ark and you‚Äôre not going to be doing any camp raids if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre asking.  You can still go and destroy a person‚Äôs camp though. But in survival mode camps are usually built with this in mind.  Not much there to destroy. Nothing there to loot really. You‚Äôll get rewards and loot from battling other players directly.  Hope that helped.
---
*  Matches currently take place in the Forest Region of Appalachia, which is surrounded by a raging Nuclear Storm.
---
The servers aren't up regardless.
---
But this game isn't exclusively a BR game, it's a fallout game. I get what you're saying however I think it's pretty great that in their first venture into online gaming that they will now have three separate game modes for their fan base to play a fallout based game in whatever mode they like best. Even if it's not the best BR game of all time, I dont know many other game titles that give you this much variety in one game and for FREE.
---
Thanks man
---
I have waited so long for the pink paint, I desperately want the pink hotter rod paint from fo4. I'll take it and be very happy though!
---
The vault boy/girl helmets are awesome as well!
---
I just want the dang beer keg
---
There are a lot of people running or a part of BoS / Enclave clans/guilds that would like to duke it out versus each other. 
---
I hope that comes next.

Scroll down and in the past 30 comments 25 are this question....

My take will develop once I try it.

So don't play it.......

"if you disagree with the assessment I have made by listengin to people who support me in my assessment...  you must be a fanboy".

Nope. Game had and has it's issues. Never said it didn't. But your "this game sucks and always has" shit is ridiculous, wind-tunnel regurgitation.

It's up now the free trial
---
Storage is fine. If I am able to have 40 weapons/Armors/Clothing, couple thousand ammo, couple hundred meds, 30 plans, and 100-200 of every crafting material in my storage... It's fine. Your doing something wrong. Not even counting the 400 personal storage.
---
I think it's a great possibility something like that will happen.
---
VATS is a fundamental part of the game. 
---
You shouldn't need to use it, but removing it removes an entire playstyle and makes this game far more twitch based than otherwise. 
---
Did you read about how I suggested it can be handled? Possibly nerfed? Ways to prevent detection?
---
Plus, it's a fundamental part of Fallout. Removing it makes this game like any other FPS.

1. It would have been surprising if they did not. Since H1Z1 and PUbg, every major game is doing it, as it brings money, lots. It even extended to kids through Fortnite.
---
2. Don't play BR then.
---
3. Who says bringing up BR servers will reduce PVEs?

People in the game are generally cool.  There is another Reddit called r/fo76filthycasuals if you aren't happy with the people here.

The little Wavy Willard makes me excited for like more theme park merch in the game too lol Would be neat if we could get like camden and wavy willard themed outfits you could find in game.
---
I'm surprisingly interested. I was never a fan of PvP in this game, when I heard the rumors - I thought Bethesda would be digging their own graves. Now that some information has come out, and we get to put our hands on it, I'm actually pleasantly surprised and excited to give it a try.
---
It's 100% skill - no vats, no OP weapon that took months of grinding, and it's all condensed into "about 20 minutes". I'm excited for an even playing field, and the opportunity to hone my scoping skills.
---
No no, you misunderstand. I didn't call you a fanboy because you disagreed with me. I called you one because you disregarded my opinion without providing any counter evidence whatsoever and did it in a shitty way. Why I quoted the

Shit like that shows you take slights to this game as a personal insult to you.

Actually excited to try it out.
---
Be safe on the country roads taking you to the West Vagina, friend.
---
I have one and its called brahmin, costs like nothing to repair too.
---
I did most of the crossbow badge with my brahmin btw
---
There really is no need to twink. There are enough variations of builds to explore for months.
---
I know what you mean, it seems like no matter what Bethesda do, people will always find something to hate.
---
I didn't see this fixed in the patch notes, let's hope it's an undocumented fix!
---
I agree, my lower level PvP character with limited inventory will be going in first
---
It‚Äôs better than Survival by a long shot - not having any gear at the start and no VATS is much better for PvP.  Survival mode is just beyond dumb and similarly PvP in adventure mode is total BS too.  Not crazy about BR in general but it‚Äôs far better for PvP 76.
---
Hi, found this comment a couple of hours ago while looking through the thread to try to find out the same thing. It's now appeared on the Bethesda launcher for me, so might be worth a look.
---
Me 2 tony
---
Try it out, if you don't like it then leave it. It's not going to affect anything.
---
Best fix of all!
---
Good idea, might pull in a few or even a lot of players.
---
Im glad they're adding an alternative mode thats more casual. Sometimes after work I like playing pvp games to just relax. With Fo76 I find it hard to get myself to play Adventure late night because its slow paced even though its fun. This is just a bit of fast paced fun.
---
Thank you for siding with the Settlers. Please make sure you keep your valuables in an easy to reach spot ;)
---
No offence to you of course.
---
What I‚Äôm saying has 0 to do with playing the game. It‚Äôs only based on the same spam posts
---
I get some fused Ghoulified Gorillas vibe from it. I hope they're more like this creeper to come.
---
Much appreciated. Though like many posts say, this is avoidable and less face it hilarious.
---
That said though, just tag the campers with a recon then open fire when you have some cover. People do it on xbox without the talking and it's easy to take them out if you have a decent weapon.

Launcher has no free trial just available to buy for $29.99
---
So don't play it. While you're at it don't cry on here either.
---
 \&gt; I preordered the collectors edition and returned it after experiencing just how bad this game was at launch.   
---
\&gt; Yeah, it's called game websites and youtube. 
---
So like 0 first hand experience, neat.
---
The PA Vault Boy/Girl heads are creepy AF.
---
Assuming it's the full game, you don't want to know.
---
Just don't start by playing on the survival server...
---
Read the posters in the train stations. If you see a lookout tower, climb it and survey the area once. Click on the thumbtacks on any map. Learn to temporarily suppress active quests so you can prioritize by area and not get overwhelmed. Do events. They give you money and stuff.
---
No handmade or gauss rifle skin &gt;:( ?! GRRRRRRRR
---
I would also like the ability to setup buy orders for mundane items like aid, junk, and ammo.  It can be tedious searching through various player vendors for a certain ammo type but if people could sell it to me directly it would be so much easier!
---
thanks!!
---
Nice assumption. I played the game for close to 20 hours.
---
Which may very well cause more issues, or fix them. I‚Äôm not sayin the game is dead in the water just that I‚Äôm wary of these big announcements because if the game in its state now isn‚Äôt changed before then, I can‚Äôt imagine it running BETTER let alone as ‚Äúgood‚Äù as it runs now.
---
Hah, that would be pleasant surprise for sure
---
When I drink one I always do the old Squidbillies yell ‚ÄúDouse the Pain!‚Äù &lt;glug glug glug&gt;
---
I already have. And I have restarted it five times now. There is no free trial there either. It is available to buy for $29.99
---
This is a really fair point.
---
Never. Bethesda took the game offline permanently.
---
im sure you love your holotapes then /s
---
Your gonna need patience and time to get that backpack and camera.
---
Better get ready to fap
---
c‚Äômon, you know i‚Äôm not referring to cuss words. quit playing dumb, u know what i‚Äôm talking about. perverts are fucking prolific on these networks.
---
Thanks for this. As a long time fallout player and (despite its problems) a huge fan of fallout 4, i hate multiplayer and swore to play this game unless it was free, But now im going to play it and depending on how fun this week is, i might purchase it.
---
You sir, are a generous person
---
We‚Äôre not actually killing ourselves though it‚Äôs a simulation
---
They haven't really said how long it'll be...
---
My body is ready
---
I'm baffled that people are actually happy about this.
---
Wondering the same. But pumped for the servers to go back up.
---
I don't know if there will be legendaries in this mode. Did they say? It would sort of make it that whoever finds the lucky legendary grab wins, since everyone starts off with the same stuff.
---
Psn is brm138
---
I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôve ever spent more than 3 minutes browsing this sub. Bethesda is criticized regularly. The difference between us and you is that we criticize because we love the game, not because we already hate it.
---
FINALLY A BULL BARREL FOR THE .44
---
it‚Äôs out now, technically. but under games  maintenance so nobody has played yet.
---
Natural selection... Survival of the fittest...
---
Depending on the drops you get, some of those mission weapons are huge. All rise was my goto till level 60 or so, and it wasn't max level. Perfect storm is a fun unique, with the right build and the wrong drops it could be your honey.
---
Will this problem be fixed with the 5.1GB downloaded from the patch 10 ?
---
Given the popularity of the FO76 Beta, they decided to rebrand it "sneak peek " expect the same outcome.
---
 War. War never changes...
---
I've been saying that we should have it as a claimable workshop and give the control to the people
---
Thanks.. I figured but it maybe glitched or something xD
---
I think the lore justification is actually creative. A robot wants to know who the best leader will be and has humans kill each other for it. No one said it was a good idea, robots in Fallout in general have always been shown to misunderstand their objectives in all sorts of messed up ways.
---
Understandable!
---
it's up
---
"We‚Äôve built an all-new Perk Card system specifically for Nuclear Winter and added 73 new Perk Cards, some of which can only be used during Nuclear Winter matches."
---
That sounds baller and all, but could someone explain it a little better? It said specifically for nuclear winter then goes on to say some can only be used in matches. If it's specifically for NW, when else could it be used?
---
only 150 every hour and a max of 1000 scripts
---
Thanks :D I just got this game earlier this week and was rambling to a few of my friends that it was really fun and they should try it but we couldn‚Äôt find where the free trial was.
---
Even had someone on youtube commented that I have no backbone for playing this game when there are "better" games out there to play.  
---
Well sorry for playing a game with my friends that I actually enjoy very much everytime we get together, well call me spineless then as long as I have FUN with a game which is exactly what a game should be XD
---
The copper harvest we've been waiting for
---
Grafton steel you find the tinker's work bench next to the one there inside the building.
---
apparently this is a ‚Äúpre-beta sneak peek‚Äù and the actual release date is yet to be announced. i think this isnt even a beta test yet, just something to give us an idea on what to expect on release
---
I should try that next time I go out to eat.   
---
"I want a refund for this food that i've eaten 1/3rd of. Turns out I don't like it"
---
&gt;Me and the Vault Boys when a nuke gets launched onto Whitesprings
---
So if you pre ordered do you get access to the beta of nuclear winter? Or is it like beta for everyone who has the game
---
poopy
---
No it's not. It's changed, and for the better.
---
Pretty much non existent. No one has ever shot at me or griefed my base in over 100hours of playtime
---
Turn on the pacifist flag in settings and play adventure. We are carebears over there. It's a great community.
---
xoTHICC
---
You can ignore them. They don't do damage.
---
Well done!
---
Pretty much....
---
It doesn't matter in adventure. Stay off random teams and watch yourself if you take workshops.
---
I think you might be overthinking the congestion.... You gotta remember that each server maxes out at only 24 ppl.  Look at Pioneer Scouts, Sheepsquatch, and Ark labs, Pioneer Scout Dailies, Biv Dailies.  How many ppl do you see there and how often? After a few days, there won't be any lines to talk to npc at all. There will hardly be anyone else around them at the same time as you.
---
Ooh where can I find those mods? Those sound incredibly good! There's still no risk to being banned for them right? I know that was an issue a while ago
---
Reminds me of why i stopped playing gta online. Nothing but foul mouthed literal children.
---
Not exactly what you're looking for, but have you seen this? The event only items on this list are probably the rarest. [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1p\_2jw2yNRY8JIE7qTfUwXTgivFDcuy0Xltb4N8kct4o/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1p_2jw2yNRY8JIE7qTfUwXTgivFDcuy0Xltb4N8kct4o/edit?usp=sharing)
---
Other way around for me, I went stealth sniper.
---
So Instigating/Furious + Chameleon/Bolstering
---
Level 30something, never met any griefers in Adventure mode. Maybe in Survival pvp but then the point there is to kill every one
---
Vrare. Play in adventure mode that will almost never happen
---
I mean it was Vault Tech who told us to ‚Äúrebuild,‚Äù and they‚Äôre some shady fellas. I can‚Äôt really say it‚Äôs too surprising.
---
go onto your kids account and change the privacy settings so only friends can message them and only friends of friends can send them friend requests.
---
It depends. Adventure mode had been retuned to not allow players to destroy your camp if you're in pacifist. Mostly now, people won't attack you or hound you much. It can still happen though, but now they won't do any damage to you.
---
what apology??????????? you drunk OP?
---
Now you are changing the topic of the conversation. The game was broken mess I feel I was 100% entitled to a refund based on false advertising. But that is not what I was here to discuss.
---
I am kinda worried about this too.
---
Theres a survival mode server where pvp is always enabled and now √• battle royale. Should keep a lot of pvpers busy
---
At lower levels, probably. But I rarely see it happen since I'm usually on the other side of the map.
---
It's still bad trust me, but go crazy
---
Can players be radio hosts
---
What behavior are you referring to that can get you arrested in the real world?  Killing people can get you arrested in the real world but is that okay in the game. I think you need to rethink your priorities if your kid can't handle the situations they shouldn't be playing an adult game. There is nothing to crazy going on in this game besides a few curse words and you can turn off game chat so settle down and get off your morale high horse and be a parent and stop expecting other people to do it for you.
---
Jesus someone went on a downvote spree here lol wtf?  Imma bump you guys
---
Ah I hadn't thought about that. No more VATS snipe you 60m away any more. Interesting....levels the playing field a great deal. Nice to see they learned from the testing in Survival Beta.
---
Ahh nah man I thought you were talking about some dude in game calling you a fucking prick or something and just being a general douche for not giving him something üòÇ but yeah then I agree
---
I've never really experienced that, but it's impossible to grief in Adventure mode now. The only real option for PvP is if you are defending a workshop.
---
You do indeed! :)
---
It's really not that common. I've got about 1000 hours now and I've only encountered a couple of griefers in that whole time and it wasn't anything we couldn't handle. Most people are really friendly - like Todd said - we could do anything and we choose to be nice \^ \^
---
Hunter's Longcoat and the clean variants of clothing, especially the Clean Spacesuit are super rare.
---
I know how you feel, I say 14 more minutes at most.
---
Random, but agreed.
---
Looks like it's available now.
---
Half of this thread r/atetheonion
---
So is there a benefit or something to becoming the overseer? So you win..your the overseer..is that it? Just start over again? Or do you get reign over the simps of 51? Run the fuckey experimebts and whatnot? Or do you just sit in the big boy chair for a quick selfie and bounce?
---
I have a pretty large friend list, only because of this game. Trading and server hopping. A tether in case you get dropped during a big event. 
---
Gt: mistarzanasa79. Id be happy to run with you sometime
---
Excellent tips, thanks! Didn't even know about adventure and passive modes.
---
Does this mean I can finally vats scorchbeasts and marsupial up to their level?
---
Have the fixed server issues? I loved the game, but finally just got fed up an quit after losing a workshop for the millionth time right as I get it up and running and using a lot of scrap to protect it only to have the server crash on me 10 min later. 
---
Was randomly watching Shroud last night on twitch because he was playing 76 and about 10 min into his game the server disconnected. 
---
I love hearing about the updates and want to get back into it, but it's just not worth my time to deal with the server disconnects.
---
I always buy stuff at camps with open doors and unlocked water processors. To those who lock everything, well let‚Äôs just say I don‚Äôt have a strong urge to defend their stuff when a bunch of super mutants show up, since they have everything ‚Äòunder control‚Äô.
---
Cool, thanks
---
You don't have to try it but even if you do - you don't lose anything so it's a win win either way if you play it or not. There's going to be plenty of other pve related content coming soon.
---
Jumpsuits and the field jackets (event rewards) are the rarest clothing.
---
Camp building and what I hoped would be in the game, Settlement building, is definitely endgame content for me also. I am hoping to hear more about where the fridges and display cases and making junk items into decor items etc. will factor in soon? Camp building is very limiting and stagnating. Need a lot more walls, paints, wallpaper, and building piece options.
---
Weapon skins and armor skins and CAMP items seem worth it to me.
---
Possibly
---
 "*Because one dog ain't enough, and two is too low, it's me, Three Dog!*"
---
Thanks for the info everyone. Can someone tell me more about survival? Sounds like you drop more on death and you can just openly kill other players.
---
Is it usually shoot on site? I want free range pvp, but also to roleplay a lil. 
---
Also what‚Äôs with destroying someone‚Äôs camp? What is there to gain? What is there to lose if your place gets destroyed?
---
That's awesome to hear. I wondered how accurate his comment was.
---
As long as your user name doesn't have the word goat in it
---
Hsjajdvhdhd
---
Easy, big boy.
---
A delusional person located. You were one click away from realizing how wrong you were.
---
You are truly in for a treat!  Enjoy my friend!
---
If I‚Äôm reading he patch notes properly, which I might not be, I‚Äôd assume that you keep you level and perks but no material (weapons/gear/supplies).
---
Adventure mode sounds great! Didn't know they added that.
---
Not likely, they can probably only afford this many players because of how much they took out for NW
---
WHAT
---
Psst...any police uniform you find lying around in the game counts as responder gear for challenges. Keep it on the DL, tho.
---
upside down 6
---
I don't want more players in my Adventure world, I can't speak for survival folks. I just like that it's a somewhat rare treat coming across people.
---
My $0.02 anyways.
---
yeah that's a viable compromise!
---
Could be they were trying to keep humans secret to reveal them later in the story since the beginning
---
The Br also has smaller areas to load
---
It doesn't matter how it's handled, if it will work on players then it provides an advantage to people who use it. And no, VATS is not a fundamental part of fallout. It was a method of aimed shots in the isometric turn based games. Once the games went 3D, it became a gimmicky bullet time mechanic (which is in no way new or fundamental to fallout) because you actually could just aim at an enemy. Now that it's online and it can't even be bullet time anymore, it's just a soft aimbot tacked on to the game
---
If it ran as fast as a wendigo, I'm going to go NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE
---
I think it‚Äôs interesting. Survival has PvP, but it‚Äôs really intended to be a more tense, risky version of Adventure. A lot of PvP players aren‚Äôt into it, they‚Äôre really looking for something more like a BR. 
---
I‚Äôm hoping for two things: 
---
1. That it proves to be a fun diversion for people like myself who can enjoy PvP, but aren‚Äôt totally consumed by it. 
---
2. That it provides a way to let players get their aggression and competitiveness out of the way, reducing the number of people doing it in Adventure.
---
Nope the 7 is up right and it‚Äôs 100% a 9
---
Me too BR√òTHER
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/347521/fallout-76-maintenance-june-10-2019/4?language%5B%5D=en
---
Looks like the game is still down and the trial hasn't launched yet. I'm hoping they don't actually have a server issue because that would seriously bring some heat from fans.
---
Oh wait, you can eat someone who's down but not dead? That's glorious
---
It could be a mistake or new content hidden within an image we are not aware of yet.
---
and also no entities to track.. or very very many fewer at least...
---
Excellent, I had no idea those were options now!
---
I wasn't that stoked.
---
But it's building.
---
Think it'll drag my interest in PVP out of the dirt.
---
Give what up?  I‚Äôm not on some holy quest to convince you to not buy a product.  There are plenty of people who think BR is a bad idea and would rather have more content for the main game.  Glad you called the upvote and downvote a ‚Äúdislike‚Äù ratio this proving my point that many redditors have no clue even what Reddit is supposed to be.  The upvote and downvote isn‚Äôt about agreement or disagreement, but rather if someone contributes to a conversation or not.  You don‚Äôt agree with my sentiments - oh well.
---
But wouldn't that make the 7 upside down if the 6 is an upside down 9?
---
I doubt it‚Äôs a mistake
---
lol there enough to go around
---
I love give me all you got. So good. I just found out that its actually Andrew WK lololol
---
Oh nice thank you!
---
They didn't add adventure mode, that is the game mode that launched.
---
IT truly creeps me out. And I don't get creeped out easily. But those swimmy boiz
---
I didn't know that i thought that since it enters through a seperate menu it would still be possible to build at the entrance to vault 51
---
Ya lvl 50 is just as common as anything else.
---
Alright,  cool your panties.  When I said it's "easy" I was referring mostly to the basic principals behind CREATING a bloodied character, I'll admit I wasn't super clear on that. I understand it's a risk/reward build and has draw backs like running any other build. And personally I could give 2 craps about what people think of me, this post attests to that I think. But we share this game with all kinds of people at varied age ranges, and the kind of comments I've received, mostly from bloodies, could seriously hurt less emotionally stable or mature people.
---
Hey OP, just letting you know that we've had reports of your Imgur link not working, and it doesn't work for me either. Ok bye üëã
---
All the items needed to make food are easy to acquire and all over the place . I have friends that are level 250+ that always ask for food because they choose to be lazy and not do the tiny bit of legwork required. I've never been low or out of food myself because, like I said, food is everywhere. Most food requires wood to cook with , boiled water , that you boil with wood at a cooking station, and some vegetable you pick up out of the ground . Or just meat from something that is dead and wood. Do the responder missions first like the game wants you to so you can get the forest disease cure recipe, and other very helpful plans . Once you reach level 20 you may want to get into a habit of bouncing from event to event to grind 20-30 is a tough time of the game . Do fertile soil and collision course a lot , grafton day . Swarm of suitors is a waste of time. Use cars at the whitespring resort to help blow up ghouls as you run for your life . Once you are level 30 , resume doing story missions. You are golden.
---
I'd say you should be able to do that over this week, I wouldn't see why not. If your rig is capable enough it can run two clients simultaneously.
---
I've never tried moving items between characters solo but I've read some threads saying it's possible but tricky.
---
I was hoping for an Order of the Tadpole fix.... I haven't been able to interact with Pompy this whole time.
---
Perfectly explained
---
Still a perfect time because of the influx of other new players. This game is 100% better when playing in a group of people near you level. Just save the story for solo.
---
Then it‚Äôs the latter of course
---
Or you could play the game, do quests, kill ghouls, and scavenge like the wasteland demands.
---
Fucking donation box.
---
I think at the beginning of every match, every player is given a set of perk cards to choose from and create a build.  but i'm just as confused as you, so take this with a grain of salt
---
Sure, sure, it will be a good tale to tell later. but in the moment: when you wake up as a newb level 2 with no idea what's goin' on, and you're in the middle of the Cranberry bog... heh. heh.
---
Level 200+... thanks for all the free stuff :)
---
FWIW a clean helmet spawns fairly regularly in the centre of morgantown on the shelves outside of the tent with all the 'civil servant' (police medic, etc) outfits in it
---
Music is very call of duty IMO.
---
Use workshops in adventure mode to prototype combat structure blueprints.
---
Nobody asked for it but it apparently has rewards so I‚Äôm guessing I‚Äôm roped into playing it. The current state of PvP is not profitable in the slightest.
---
The closest thing I experienced to griefing in the past few months was just last night - we took a workshop... and a random came... and just STOOD THERE. for no reason. in our workshop. and did nothing. lol. most people are not super confrontational and would rather leave and find a new server. plus they also changed it so people can't attack you at your camp if you own a workshop which was something that people used to do to "grief" other players etc. it's alot better :)
---
Adult here, PSN AldorinDK. I see Nuclear Winter being out on the title menu, but as far as I can tell, servers are still down, right?
---
Everyone starts with 1 card for each attribute in NW. Cards earned for NW may require x amount of a certain attribute to equip which is dependent on your attribute levels in adventure mode
---
This is gonna be the competitive fallout everyone was whining for when survival came out. I felt the same way at first but bringing more people to the game is a good thing, even if it's in a battle royale mode. And besides we pve people have wastelander's dlc to look forward to. I'm gonna try it for sure and I'm actually kinda excited for it. Only briefly played any other battle royale games.
---
Nothin. If i can make it I will. I'll try to be on tonight, Monday, round 5 ish central time.
---
Well everyone said being able to repair your gear using repair kits and not your resources was p2w so I believe yes the world is doomed.
---
Oh excellent, thanks for the clarification. I wasn't sure as I only played the beta.
---
Read the wiki
---
Seems like theyre still fucked for me
---
Honest question about Rad Worms in case anyone knows: IF I have the perk that mitigates limb damage, do I need to worry about rad worms?
---
Lol yeah, that was my first thought, too. 'They do know nobody uses the missile launcher and laser rifle, right?'
---
i don't think you remember the fear we once had during early encounters. most new players run away as fast as they can. i doubt any will be following around asking for more free stuff by giving them some water n stims
---
I actually want open word pvp (pk).
---
Maybe. That would make a lot of sense
---
Bobby pins     One pound each
---
If we can get private servers and modding then I am certainly up for playing it fo a long time. VIS G, Armor and weaponsmith as well as BLD and maybe some quest mods comparable to PV trio and we are all set.
---
I hope everything actually comes this time though
---
I've speculated before that the new NPCs have to come from outside of Appalachia. They are called "Wastelanders" and Appalachia isn't a wasteland (yet). This could refer to general nuclear wasteland in surrounding areas or it could refer to the Capital Wasteland. I'd love to the the latter, because it would give the wastelanders more background. If the wastelanders are really from Vault 79, then V79 probably lies outside of Appalachia, in some desolate area. If V79 were in Appalachia, they wouldn't call themselves wastelanders. So Vault 79 is either a place of origin for the wastelanders outside of Appalachia or it's a vault inside Appalachia and it's somehow relevant to the new storyline...
---
Don't think you can do it in teams.
---
100% with u on Excavator paints. I personally havn't used that armor since like lvl 50 at most, Now 218.
---
Wtf why do you deserve special treatment? You don't speak for all of us.
---
You may come across some griefers from time to time but its much less frequent than it was in BETA and upon release.
---
The only time I have been really harassed is at a workshop. I don't take workshops except for the weekly challenges and don't PvP. I've been one-hit while at a workbench once and I have been killed while in a vendor menu. 
---
If you don't engage back they *usually* get bored and move on to the next person.
---
Finally Mr. Pebbles gets some representation
---
Welcome. If you are on PC and want some company from a very high level player hit me up lol
---
Yes, up to 4
---
I have had a LOT of random assholes camping at places like train stations and flatwood set on harassing other players.  I've always been on pacifist.  But its still annoying.  Was SO much worse when players could destroy each other's camps.  But yes, the survival flunkies tend to wander around adventure trying to bully others.
---
You should try a br. Everyone drops in equal (minus hacks). It's what a lot of us wanted in survival mode. Barely play survival anymore but this is what fps is about, not gear but getting gear and using it on a guys face
---
&gt; Not only do you people seem to be fine with how Bethesda has been raping this wonderful franchise for profit its clear by continuing to support the abomination that is 76 that there is seriously something wrong with you.
---
I think there is something seriously wrong with you for getting so worked up about a video game. 
---
I mean did 76 catch you getting out of the shower and see your shortcoming or something?
---
I'd love that so much. They did mention companions but it might be a lot to hope for that they can live at your camp or be placed down in an area of our camp like our Brahmin or like how tamed animal friends patrol your camp.
---
Excellent, thanks! That makes a lot of sense, they would have gotten bored mostly and moved to something else.
---
Yes, exactly. Also those starting melee weapons are actually pretty strong, much more than lousy 10mm pistols or rifles. Should be fun.
---
Let people have fun, if you don't like it then don't play or spend money on it, no one is forcing you or anyone else to play or pay for the game
---
Thanks for the tip, still gonna keep playing.
---
its still rampant, at least in my casual play experience.  But I do stick to the forest areas for the most part.  I just get on mic and berate them for wasting their ammo on me in a disappointed, condescending mommy voice.
---
Preach brother.....
---
Nope. Light fixtures. Seemingly put in just to taunt us.
---
Oof. Is Hellfire PA actually a skin then? If so that's a massive disappointment. Mostly because I prefer the normal Hellfire PA, none of those three skins does it for me. :(
---
You should say what platform you are on
---
&gt; its out on pc 
---
where? I can only see the price 50% off in the Beth launcher.
---
Yes please! I want raider guards to patrol my base as I scour the wastes
---
if you can keep up with your addictions you could use Junkie's weapons
---
Good, we're already 2, join us
---
People like things *I* don't like??? **THEY MUST BE INSANE!**
---
Owls are just Tree Penguins.
---
Phenomenal!  Should rename it Queen Slayer üòÅ
---
Definitely unpower your vending machine, people can still fast travel to you if it's on.
---
However, if you feel like being a dick, find out where the spawn point is for your camp and train all of your turrets on that location. All of your turrets will fire at people as they fast travel into your camp and you can steal their loot.
---
Also, make sure you stash all of your junk and most of your aid because you lose junk AND aid items in this game mode, randomly might I add.
---
Other than that, have fun and try to get the weekly 3 star survival weapon as well.
---
Have fun!
---
Is this yours?
---
It‚Äôs still down, probably going live soon though
---
That‚Äôs IF they find the right gear each game
---
Bro you just posted cringe
---
They are not (PS4)
---
Absolutely have no idea what you mean. What build do you want.? A heavy weapons build or a melee build.
---
I'm happily insane then!!!
---
I‚Äôm so ready
---
Enjoy your report, friend. Just because you don't like it does not mean others cannot find enjoyment. And this is from someone who just wanted the game to have more content, less bugs, and a price drop.
---
No buddy, it will be fine. Would you mind just turning around and putting your gun away for me. I just want to make sure there are no giant ticks on your back *shotgun pump noise*
---
I really hope some of the new weapons include the assault carbine from New Vegas. The handmade is cool and all but I‚Äôm more into AR style weapons üò≠
---
I was watching commentary from a few streamers that I *used* to respect, who obviously didn't care about the company or 76 specifically, just throwing memes around instead of making any kind of useful observations.  Unfortunately they were the front end of the twitch commentary, so their disinterest was prominently displayed for tens of thousands.
---
24 in the regular world and 52 on the battle royale map.
---
Looks sort of like an ultracite excavator suit
---
See that "X" over theer?
---
Go stand in it.
---
I'm going to go hit the button to launch a nuke on the "X"
---
Can you show us on the doll where Todd Howard hurt you?

Limit what can be taken... say fill it with 100 waters... players could only take 2 waters per the already existing 20 time clock vendors already use. 
---
Same goes for other items on a per player basis and limit. 
---
Also if you place lvl 5 armor... those lvl 10 and higher wouldn‚Äôt see it, same with weapons.
---
Don't team with randos too. There's a trick where they'll team and then init pvp with a friend off team. It's not that bad because you won't take damage in pacifist, but the rando on your team dies and asks you to get his loot. Soon as you take the loot, now you take full damage. Weird coding but that's how they start pvp.

Jesus, you two get a room.

I don't like that that is becoming accepted and normal. That a game can release in a broken state and be fixed later. The game should release as flawlessly as possible and then expand as time goes on. Bugs and glitches are one thing, but it was quite obvious that FO76 was not ready for prime time and needed another 6 months of development.
---
&gt;Looking to youtube, and media is going to be pretty awful way
---
then where should I go? Other than youtubers I trust? I also come here obviously, but I have to be careful here because the only people left are the ones that are such fans they put up with the launch and following couple months.
---
Wow, someone put their grumpy pants on this morning! üòÆ
---
Easy, killer. Go eat a Snickers.
---
And it burns, burns, burns.
---
I think it depends a bit on the platform, but it's not bad at all in my experience. I'm at almost 400 hours on PC and have never really had to deal with griefers. Any experiences I've had that came close were more funny than frustrating (like the two 'park rangers' trying to charge a 'camping fee' and attacking when I refused to pay).
---
Nope, but don't worry, coming soon we've got a choice of skins for the war drum, golf club, submachine gun, and syringer!
---
lol somebody wanted to shed some karma.
---
I bought the game because I wanted what they were selling. I support them getting the game into the shape it should have been on release, because I'm already $60 out. It behooves me to support them.

I don‚Äôt think quite yet, but very close to it.

Thanks for the comment. Gonna block you now so I don‚Äôt see anything else you have to say.

That's what I was thinking. The helmet's very Excavator-y and the roundness reminds me of the Ultracite set.

Oh!  I didn't notice that while I was submitting another ticket last night.  (didn't bother to expand the spoilers then) That's good!  Well, half good since there's still the frog jars and outfit, but it's something.  There wasn't anything quest related in the latest patch notes..... \*fingers crossed\* for the next one.
---
Did you at least save on buying it now that it‚Äôs only $17USD ?
---
I'm on PC, and at work for the next 4 hours :( good luck though!
---
Well you know thats just your opinion, right?
---
Your a little late OP autism awareness month was April. Good luck with getting mad at people who enjoy things you don‚Äôt, video games are a big deal.
---
Pacifist simply makes your attacks not do damage to other players. If you do one of many things you can still be engaged in PvP, such as picking a locked object, having a workshop contested, having a team mate attack a player or either of the afore mentioned, as well as other actions.
---
Yeaaah golf club and syringer, everybody's favorite weapon T-T
---
If that‚Äôs the Battle Royale then yes
---
What about the statues that bleed? Like the power armor one that physically bleeds when you hit it. It's not _quite_ what you're describing but maybe we already have a janky testing dummy available.
---
When the servers are back online someone should see if the damage number change works with those statues...
---
Well they changed the message saying that servers were under maintenance but the servers are still under maintenance so idk. They'll probs be back up soon tho.
---
When the downtime is done I think
---
I've played since launch and 99.5% of the time have been solo. It is a multi-player game, but that doesn't mean that you have to choose to play with others.  There are some events (such as Scorched Earth and Encryptid, for example) where it is beneficial for players to gather and work together toward a common goal.  But you definitely don't have to "team up".  You complete the objective, get your XP and rewards, and then go you separate ways.
---
I know.  I love it.
---
That's a complex way just to trick people into PVP lol
---
I'll be on in a little. My psn is same as my Reddit name. Feel free to add me
---
servers are down, been like this for three hours. shouldn‚Äôt be that hard for them to roll out a patch but if it‚Äôs taking three hours i guess it is
---
Sooo much cringe haha
---
I'd say it comes down to playstyle. The right kind of build or combat engagement easily lets you take little to no damage in many circumstances, meaning Healing Factor doing little after combat ends. Healing Factor basically only handicaps you in the midst of combat, as it doesn't only reduce the effectiveness of chems, but also the effectiveness of RadAway and Stimpaks.
---
If you get the recipes and invest perks and time in gathering the necessary ingredients from time to time to build a solid stash, extend chem duration through perks and stack it with BioMesh mod for extra 50% duration, I'd dare say chems are not just viable but an amazing addition to any build in the game. Literally *huge* buffs for almost 10 minutes (depending on how mod, perks, etc. stack) versus healing outside of combat, seems like an easy pick.
---
Whether you stay on top of your chem management, both in terms of inventory and usage of them, is a whole other matter to consider. If you don't mind managing that, there's little to no reason to pick up Healing Factor and to simply go for a chem build instead!

&gt;People seem to be forgetting that people bought Fallout 76 because they were fans of Fallout&gt;
---
Yeah. The problem here is that they wanted it to just be another standard Fallout SP experience. Then were pissed when it wasn't. Not to even mention entirely new ideas and game mechanics.... Those are often "an insult to Fallout fans"
---
"No one" may have asked for a BR mode.... But it's a popular thing. If it brings more players and money in? Great. That helps ensure longevity and more content.
---
I don't think it's just a respec, but rather something to restart the character entirely but have maybe more SPECIAL points as you level or more 'epic' Perks to pick from.  I wonder when that comes about though, if before or after the story line with Wastelanders.
---
My server is back up but I can‚Äôt login in because my ‚Äúaccount lacks the required entitlements‚Äù. Googled around and it does have to do with server error. Few more minutes and we should be killing each other.

A player who is flashing a light at the ground means the same thing as well  :)
---
Taking a closer look, you're right.
---
Nol it shows that I have actually spent months playing this game... trying every build imaginable, from super tough, to intentionally nerfed. 
---
I dig in every corner, I spend my time exploring every area, inside and out.
---
No, My "pfft" response that YOU see as "fanboyism" is saying "my first hand experience beats your second &amp; third-hand argument".
---
There isn't an "Enclave" build.

The ring of Fire.

Ditch healing factor. Chem usefulness way outweighs that mutations benefit.
---
So after reading and talking to people, yes we can craft Nuka-shine and most things in there

All wood armor, chainsaw.

Explosive laser weapon value is going nowhere until the next dupe exploit. They're still super saught after in PVE.

You claimed it would make it more interesting.

You have 0 hands on experience with this new mode.

Argue semantics all you want, but you're the one chatting shit here.

No military or vets here? Everyone knows what a ‚Äúwoobie‚Äù is in that world... it‚Äôs the best thing ever! Haha!
---
I thought they changed addictions so that they aren't cured by dying.  No?
---
I think its a fun game, but a horrid game at that. I am with you 100%. What they did to us with this game was not okay.
---
I don‚Äôt see people angry, which is absurd.
---
When EA does something as minor as micro transactions, people go crazy. But when Bethesda blatantly uses it‚Äôs beloved fanbase like this, to test something, to use our brand-loyalty to get us to buy the unfinished mess of a game, and then to start completing the game overtime, that‚Äôs a whole different ballgame. It‚Äôs not okay, all this stuff we‚Äôre getting isn‚Äôt add-ons, it‚Äôs Bethesda finishing the game that should have been finished in November. They even admitted this. So to see people be so giddy and anti-criticism about this game goes to show how much Bethesda played us.
---
They arent listening to us, we don‚Äôt matter AT ALL to them. They‚Äôre releasing phone games ffs. Nobody wanted that shit.
---
They have not
---
Adding onto this, some bulk junk is extremely helpful and lowers the weight significantly
---
They're still working on it
---
The servers are not up yet.
---
It‚Äôs happening for everyone right now
---
No. I'm not going to watch a shill talk about how great the game is.
---
The fact is, they put out a barebones shell of a game, that people told them BEFORE RELEASE wasn't going to be a good idea. Because they wanted to do as little work as possible on their end for the mac profits.
---
I bought the game yesterday and I got the same thing.
---
They aren‚Äôt yet but soon I think they will be
---
Even if you respec, one of your other SPECIAL stats will drop. We only get 56 points of SPECIAL per character. We default to 1 point in each category and get 1 every level until we hit level 50. The limitation is balancing.

I recently came back myself... Does that make me a masochist? Or was it a sadist...

I play on PS4 with an average of 28-44 MB/s I get a disconnect once every 4-6 hours now since launch, there‚Äôs some inventory latency here and there but otherwise it‚Äôs pretty standard now, the performance has come a long way

Might actually check the maintenance status to see if it is over.

Kudos then dude! Really captured the essence of Twin Peaks! I was expecting a nuke going off and a few radroaches as per that amazing episode of the Return but I will also settle for the black lodge entrance and owls!! ;-)
---
They were told, numerous times, that what they were planning (no NPCs, for example) was a BAD IDEA. Then the canvas bad debacle. It was greed, pure and simple.
---
No, they were never promised, but FO76 is a shite game because it's barely even an actual game--it's just a corporate sandbox where they got in enough trouble they're seeing profit vanish, so they have to actually do something. Their ploy of "let's release something that's barely a game and tell players THEY get to do with it what they want, then we'll rake in the big bucks" failed.
---
It just works.
---
It's mostly plans you already have so enjoy all that extra weight
---
They are fixing the game. They are adding NPCs and a bunch of other stuff in the update. They do care about what happens and they have fixed or are in the process most of the complaints.
---
We knew that FO76 would not be very smooth, they were not experienced in multiplayer, but they are working hard to fix it and that is what matters to me.

Do we know if the paint rewards will be character based or account based yet?

That sounds like a really good idea.

My kids loved fallout 4. And to them..fallout 4 was a gane of running around daddys base with a sword..similar to minecraft. I would dunp all my weapons in a container..so no guns...like a better graphiced minecraft. I will not however allow them on thia game. There is no safe spot where you can elude the violence.   My kids game..we game together. But i stand by the esrb. Its there for a reason.

Many companies never founded their deployment strategy on CI/CD , that‚Äôs why they pay people like me and only usually after it‚Äôs so cumbersome to deploy that it takes sometimes a year or more to get the company into shape and get the deployments rolling out. With that said I‚Äôve worked at many large (fortune 50 and 500) companies and it will come as no surprise that only 1 had a full CI/CD pipeline and it‚Äôs because I built it under the radar and worked directly with the devs. Management is the enemy of CI/CD / devops/agile because if all those things are in place you don‚Äôt really need middle management.

 Healing factor has got to be the most overrated thing in the game

Nah. Thinking platforms are going up one at a time. Downloading for my roommate for when he gets home from work. Still looking for my Xbox. I'll reply once I find it.

Don't. Cats are the little known scourge of the wastes

You can find if the maintenance is over at [Fallout 76 forums](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/347521/fallout-76-maintenance-june-10-2019/6?language%5B%5D=en)
---
Most of the players just ignore you. _Most_ of them.
---
After recent changes the worst you can expect out of the average player in Adventure mode is spam _Invite to Team_ requests. Some people want a free ride to your location (free Fast Travel to teammates) while other people... well, they uh... they go to your camp and redecorate for you... so be wary of that one. The really not very nice people will get you into a team and then try to activate PVP. You should also be wary of that one. Just be wary of team invites in general.
---
As for the community on the forums you need to be wary of flat out bad advice and bizarre implications. When you see someone &gt; 200 they did not cheat to get there - it's easy. When someone cries about god tier weapons - they're not. When the latest YouTube video shows up telling you how to farm some ridiculous location - it's probably wrong. When tons of players congregate at Whitespring to get "all the god tier rolls" - they're naive.
---
Get a dense chest piece, find a shotgun, use Enforcer, and live in the Cranberry Bog once you hit level 40. Run events as often as you can. You'll blow past them in loot and levels in no time. :)
---
Private servers or at least logical "servers" would be so cool, so you could actually build a community!
---
Yeah, I think it feels more like Fallout, especially with the new images on the title screen.
---
Ah ok makes sense
---
I'm not sure...I don't touch Survival because PVP in games like this aren't my thing, especially since I only play casually and don't ever take the time to farm for legendaries or anything so I'm always outmatched.  
---
But this is something I might check out because it's sort of a level playing field each time, and it sounds like you'll still be able to earn stuff for you character in other modes.
---
I'd imagine there are also going to be plenty of people who want to be able to challenge others with equipment they've earned and not in a Battle Royale setting, so Survival mode will still have a decent number of players. The two modes don't seem to be in direct conflict to me.
---
couldn‚Äôt agree more
---
I'm already wet over here.
---
Seeing as they added a completely new networking element to 76 - matchmaking - it's unsurprising it takes a while to set up for the first time.
---
It‚Äôs definitely very intense and cool you notice it right away
---
Agree with you, the default squad mode put solo players at huge disadvantage. Other online games handle this better, in hardcore mode you either go into one of the two opposing teams or free-for-all everyone fight everyone else. Mixing the two mode will keep solo players from enjoying the game, unless he/she is as good as god and is able to handle a group by himself, which is hard but possible.
---
The comments disagree, I am clearly the odd one out and should just go die in a hole somewhere.
---
Don't be too negative, give it a chance to work, let them try to do it without shooting them down.
---
I like it. I like it a lot!
---
Just do it, you won't regret it.
---
It's actually free to play for a week on all platforms so now is your chance to try it out
---
It's free for a week, ask yourself after the trial.
---
By any chance was the cats name gizmo?
---
So. Much. Better.
---
I'm planning to see how the new mode is for levelling up a new toon, so it's a fresh level 1 for me :)
---
Well I started yesterday. No veterans at the exit. But oh well I'm rocking a leather set of armor now wooo
---
Correct me if i'm wrong, but i think that's what it says when they're testing it before it comes back online. Shouldn't be too long now. It will say it's down for maintenance, then switch to the lacking entitled requirements thing every time.
---
I love this game so much and i will always support it.
---
I am happily insane.
---
&gt; Or the terrible enemy AI that just sees enemies walking toward you, eating bullets the whole way.
---
I haven't played since launch week and this is one of the things I didn't like about the game. Especially going in solo, All the enemies in an area would start coming straight at me. If I had people with me at least it would spread them out between us but it still was annoying.
---
I...I took the day off for this...
---
It is definitely a good time to start playing, especially with the massive bug fixes coming with the new update, it will feel much more complete.
---
"At launch"
---
yet here you are, stating that the past 6 months are a shitshow.
---
You haven't played it for 6 months. I've been playing it for the last four.
---
You hesitate to take my opinion seriously, because I dare to take one that doesn't agree with you. It is that simple, and saying otherwise is disingenuous.
---
You formed an opinion on what was a very rough launch. and then fucked off. You can' t possibly form a firsthand opinion of the state  game since that time. 
---
Like I said... you do  you. That's not "dismissive without proof or evidence", that's "you refuse to be moved in any way" so it's pointless.
---
If you don't understand the special qualities and value of the Fear Teddy Bear I can only pray for your soul and hope you find inner peace.
---
Ohhh noooo
---
Around...think about it..
---
Not sure! Maybe melee cause ammo seems rare
---
Savage ... and yet ... satisfying
---
yeah with the mentioned Cannibal Perk.....rather intended to be used on killed enemies but people found out it apparently works with downed players as well
---
We've all done things we're ashamed of. Killed a fox once just because it startled me. Go give a possum a friendly scratch to get over it.
---
Yes!!! Solid post. Thank you for this :)
---
Adventure mode is the "regular" game. Survival mode is a separate server, but you use the same character. All your exp/loot carries over between the two. Survival is more pvp focused - you get more exp, have no restrictions on pvp, and lose some of your aid items as well as the junk you're carrying if you die
---
Just don't do the quest. I've played for years but when ever I hear him drop something and yell, "WHY. DO THESE THINGS. KEEP HAPPENING TO ME." I still laugh.
---
I would wait until november if I were you..
---
You don't like it? Fine, OK, move on.
---
I like it and enjoy spending my time there. Always wanted online multiplayer fallout and now I have it.
---
Same here! It‚Äôs incredible how far this game has come, having so much fun with it at the moment and it‚Äôs getting even better.
---
Aluminium and Lead are both worth bulking for lowered weight. I think most others don't make any difference, and Oil at least gets heavier (unless they fixed this).
---
Since we're not able to, uh, "procreate" with other players in game, it only makes sense that we would go the *other* way.
---
The servers are still offline. Just be patient.
---
That will require a ton of server space and infrastructure
---
Okay awesome! Thanks :)
---
What is your S.P.E.C.I.A.L.?
---
I've played since around launch and have avoided much of the multiplayer aspect of the game. You can solo the vast majority of the current content and with how few players are on each server, you can spend quite a bit of time playing and not see another player because the map is pretty big. 
---
Hope you have fun and enjoy the game.
---
I wouldn't mind an increase to the special point cap. I have to constantly re-kit for teaming vs solo, crafting vs adventuring, it gets really frustrating.
---
I can just imagine high levels snatching stuff from these boxes and selling them to train station vendors for profit.
---
Being normal is overrated anyway, which reminds me, did i ever tell you the definition of insanity?
---
Too late to go back to work?
---
Plans make fantastic bedding material for the princess bed.
---
I'm actually curious. There has always been a Lovecraft quest in the Bethesda fallouts. Did 76 have a dunwich building in it?
---
Haha first thing that came to my mind...almost starting looking for it at its mentioning
---
Hopefully no one said that, because that‚Äôs not true. People like you are the reason the gaming would can never stay stagnant. The bar has the be raised!
---
Just like the number of reports on this post. I‚Äôve never seen so many.
---
It's midnight here. I bought extra beer but it might be bed time soon.
---
At launch the game crashed every 30 minutes, now maybe three times in a few hours of play. Definitely more stable. No I only buy stuff I like and I like well-designed skins for weapons. Have thousands of atoms don‚Äôt know what to buy atm.
---
Listen, while I would love a host, I am totally okay with just more music. Or a mix of FNV and Fallout 3's radio.
---
What platform do you play on?
---
wait... wastelanders aka human npcs are coming to 76?   
---
maybe I will come back to the game if that is the case. I did like it, it just lost my interest really fast.
---
Just put your valued aid and junk away and dont freak out if you get killed. Thats about it, your camp should be fine just dont go there while your on the leaderboard if you dont want to rebuild it
---
Maintenance has probably not been completed yet. It's been going on since 10 AM ET.
---
Only the players that actually cheated in the game by using external programs got perma banned If I recall correctly and the ones that have abused in-game system have only gotten temp banned.
---
Never mind, as described in other posts this just means there is still server maintenance
---
Doesn‚Äôt like the game but specifically comes and takes his time to an all Fallout 76 Reddit to make sure everyone knows his feeling of not liking the game...
---
Do you have the luck card cap collector? If you equip that you can press y to search it to get double caps. There are maps online you can use to find all the stashes.
---
Ah, a yongnah subscriber.
---
I will have to head back tonight after work
---
With a handle like MotherTeresa you don't have any Charisma?? LOL ... well THAT will sure catch them off guard!
---
It would hurt me more if I had not given up on Fallout years ago, this community is a shining example of people seemingly blind to what once was.
---
There will be significantly less stress on the servers in BR mode.
---
* no weapons, armor, or stash is carried over, so the game isn't tracking tens of thousands of individual player items
---
* CAMPS don't require materials to build, which means they can reduce or even eliminate world-spawning resources like logs. Not having to track thousands of in-world items and keep track of who's accessed them should help considerably. 
---
* The map is much smaller, and can likely be loaded entirely into memory while you're queued up waiting for the match to begin.

---
Yes, people who invest in Perception and Luck and Agility will have an advantage in using it. That's the point.
---
Calling it an aimbot is an extreme exaggeration. You need to invest in that build to make it work well. Did you not read about how I said it can be modified for this mode? How about what I said in the context of the entire post?
---
I never said Fallout was the first game to utilize a free/slow time mode where you aim at an enemy. Just as I never claimed that Fallout was the first game to take place in a post-apocalypse. Neither of these changes the fact that both have been part of the game since the first and have taken different forms in order to accommodate the setting.
---
Removing is also cripples controller users on PC as well as anyone who isn't a twitchy, FPS player. You're wanting an advantage for one group by removing the one already in place for the other.
---
It's as simple as this: **I want people who invest in** ***character skill*** **to have an advantage over** ***player skill.***
---
its funny because its true.. ;D
---
You will earn atoms in the game fairly quickly so no need to worry about necessarily spending on it!
---
Grape mentats and maxed out hard bargain if you buy from railway station vendors. Players might be selling cheaper if you check their camps. You *might* get lucky if you grind some workshops/events and stumble on them.
---
The grape mentats and hard bargain works for selling for more too
---
Who?
---
Nah Spoder-man.
---
I'm not a melee player and never will be in fallout, but I wish I were. Definitely the best build in the game if you're looking for damage vs. cost. Sneak sniper is still good, don't get me wrong, but I think melee is objectively an easier/better build in the long term.
---
Grape Mentats, Sweet Roll, and Alcohol is what I use to buff Charisma, only knocks a few hundred off at most though.
---
So you can only increase your SPECIAL up to level 50, so you can't have 15s across the board, you'll have to decide what you want to focus in and as a result some other SPECIAL will take a hit (I'm running a 1 Endurance, 1 Charisma build because the other stats were too important to me to be able to put anything else in those two). And perks aren't set in stone, you can swap them around at any time. So for example if you have 5 intelligence and have 10 available cards for intelligence, you can pop in the lockpicking cards when you need them, but otherwise uneqiup them to make better use of those slots with other perk cards.
---
Also, you learn mods for weapons and how to make weapons better by scrapping them. So if you're using a hunting rifle a lot, pick up every hunting rifle you see and scrap the ones you're not actively using so you can learn mods to improve them.
---
Also, since weapons are levels, make sure you swap out as you level up. If you are using a level 1 weapon at level 5, you won't do as much damage as you would if you swapped out to a lv 5 variant of the same weapon.

I'm honestly little worried. It never takes this long, like yeah new stuff and all but... it should not take 3 hours. I believe they have tried and realized that something in it does not work and are trying to fix it, and this theory is supported by the fact that 3h ago they said it would be online in a moment, like usual.
---
Doesn‚Äôt it say ‚Äúwe‚Äôve brought fallout 76 offline for scheduled maintenance‚Äù in the upper right corner of your screen? I‚Äôm not asking in a reproachful way. Just curious.
---
That's good to know, thank you.
---
There‚Äôs was also a vault that had inhabitants sacrifice their overseer every year ‚Äúto keep everyone alive‚Äù
---
After FO with the Pack Hunt mod, it's just sad. I cant even be bothered.
---
If  feel like the biggest variable here is what players may do with preloaded camp blueprints. But without turrets and having to keep moving your camp as the storm closes it's going to be very interesting seeing the meta reveal itself.
---
Honestly it just depends on the consumer. Some people are ok with it because they always wanted a multiplayer fallout game and others aren‚Äôt because they wanted a single player game where they where able to do what they wanted. State your opinion but don‚Äôt try to attack those who actually enjoyed the game
---
The fallout 76 bandwagon is loaded up again. Pure sh*t posts and over 50 replies in mere minutes! Amazing.
---
Tasty ass kissing right here.
---
If you‚Äôre a vet we have a veterans group for Fallout and other games if you‚Äôre interested... let me know.
---
It sure will. But it would also be a cool feature some people might want. There‚Äôs obviously a problem if people are running keyboard stroke machines to stay online to sell..... I‚Äôm not saying THIS is the ideal solution... but there‚Äôs a solution that should be found. 
---
To your point, it may be more expensive than simple QoL fixes :-(
---
Kill mutants, loot their stuff, sell for profit.
---
West-Tek, Huntersville, RobCo (sometimes) should have mutants.
---
If you've got hard bargain 3/higher charisma can get about 50 caps per sharpshooters assault rifle.
---
Also check player vending, not sure metal walls plans drop but if they do your likely to find em for a much cheaper price.
---
put them in after the fact lol, they going to break the game
---
Funny thing is, nobody owns a franchise. Not really.
---
Run your own D&amp;D or GURPS game in the same universe. Tell the story how you want. The only barrier is if you want to make money off of it.
---
If you equip green thumb and grab every single plant at Silva and Billings homesteads you'll get about 400 caps in just about 5 minutes.
---
This will probably make survival a more level playing field. Question is how many people running around in survival with Assassin's Sentinel armor and explosive lasers actually want a competitive playing field?
---
He was a cocky prick.
---
I know so many are super excited for it and I am actually breaking down and spending on it myself. I don't care if everyone and their brother will be wearing it &lt;3
---
Pick up weapons and armor to sell.
---
Why even post this unless you like downvotes?
---
Does anyone know how this trial works? Like if I decide to buy the game, do I have to redownload the ‚Äúfull‚Äù version? Does my progress carry over? Thanks ahead of time.
---
Planning out levelling is the biggest piece of advice you could get. 
---
Think about what you want. Check in on the level 50 perks early and save some skill points till when you hit there so your not grinding them out for the next 25 levels after *(which come hella slower)*
---
Awesome :) thanks! 
---
Is it like a normal fallout game where you can stick it in a random drawer and it will still be there when you get back?
---
We going to get a bigger fucking camp budget.
---
No whole grains don‚Äôt need to be processed in the sense that say flour or ham are processed foods.  If you harvest wheat and eat the berries you are having whole grains.
---
A good easy way that I use is to just sell all the guns you find. Especially if you have max Hard Bargain, you can make like 20-30 caps for something like a mid tier combat shotgun. 
---
You can easily get a few hundred caps from a full sweep of Camden Park.
---
So, don't play the battle royale and just visit 51 in adventure mode.
---
I appreciate your answer, thank you.
---
A nobody, be glad you don't know.
---
But you sure do sing his tune.
---
Weren't we all supposed to be reluctant, dysfunctional allies?
---
Yeah the last update on the website has been the same text copied and pasted 3-4 times.
---
 There is corn everywhere. You can grow lots easily. Corn and Boiled Water make Corn Soup. Hotkey it and be done with hunger and thirst. ;)
---
Ask yourself how much do you spend on a movie, and how long does that last?  You're spending that much for a game, so even if you only get 4 hours fun, it's not too bad of a deal.
---
I love this game
---
glad the fixed the 0% vats bug
---
Or set up joinable factions. They did emphasize long term story telling.
---
Naw I know , I have my own very full discord. Was just taking the piss. But I'm glad you have a nice group
---
I've had the best and worst in alpha,beta testing but I see what you mean as far as is this a PR and what others have said that yeah it makes sense to NOT have had it in MD. I was thinking as per my personal life in that world and with all NDA I had to do ( which is how and why I've been asked to them so much, because I have name that I can't use in open Forums ***IF*** I wish to stay active) Just glad that your post has many people taking time to read it and share, I can't say I'll read all of them lol but glad it's here. So thanks again for sharing this.
---
No, because the servers are still down.
---
I have been waiting for humans to came back to Appalachia since launch. Always figured they would. But I did have problems connecting with the game without them there. I never botched about it online though. I played for a bit then put it down until a few major updates hit. And look at that, I'm super stoked for it. I'll be hopping back on and finishing up the default main quest. 
---
I loved fallout 4 so much, but without people it did feel a little barren. SO HYPED FOR THIS FALL.
---
Shit, I own the game and will still do that
---
Go do the pioneer questline. When you need to do badges, id advise; archery, swimming, athletics. They are the fastest to complete and involve fun side quests with refreshing gameplay. And once completed, you get the backpack adding 60 extra carry weight. EXTREMELY useful.
---
Not murgle???
---
Some healthy generalizing right there
---
That‚Äôs the newest thing I‚Äôve seen, thanksüëçüèº
---
I am not trying to move  you. Not my job. What I am doing is telling you that your entire 20 hours of gameplay during BETA testing is not indicative of where the game is now... so coming in here, swinging dick and telling me that it's "objectionable" that  enjoy the game is ridiculous.
---
You don't want to play it? That's fine, I don't give a shit. Like I said  "you do you". But saying "I played 20 hours at launch so this game is shit now, 6 months later is stereotypical online troll-shit.
---
There is an option currently to Respec one point at a time beyond level 50
---
The fact that this is a problem you have, and are worried about... is indicative the game has untapped potential in terms of commerce gameplay.
---
What‚Äôs max caps right now? Also.... great job at running such a great operation to be maxed out on caps!!!!
---
I see nothing on the Bethesda Twitter except true announcement post
---
My psn JerryMac2564
---
excited is good, but screams are bad :P
---
If they locked the punch bowl because it was causing instability with some of the new content that was released (which is what I suspect happened) then it might be for the best that it is still locked
---
Nuclear Winter will be in the FOREST only. The boundaries are marked by a wall of fire that will close in on you from time to time. So, whatever is availalble in the FOREST
---
its the fucking maintenance for fucks sake
---
Probably take another hour or whatever.. Hopefully before the 4pm conference starts , ugh
---
Yeah it's great to have a solid group.
---
And how are they supposed to know they fucked up if nobody speaks up? I'm going to keep complaining about 76 until they fix it, and I hope everyone else u happy about the game for whatever reason continues to do so.
---
Pete Hines said we would eventually get fully offline play with traditional mod support at some point down the road when 76 was announced, fwiw. Whether we get it or not js still in the air but it was promised to us pretty much from day one. With the Wastelanders expansion, the game everyone initially wanted is right there in front of us, its only one fulfilled promise away.
---
Yea looks like the excavator got a beer belly (full of lead ores maybe)
---
I think its exciting the direction the game is going. However get those big Bethesda nuts off of your chin. Alot of the criticisms Bethesda and fallout recieved early on  was definitely deserved.
---
Todd, I think you need to voice one of the upcoming characters in Fallout 76.
---
It detaches your right arm?
---
20 minutes and I'm out for the day. Laundry, dishes, and heck, even shaving take priority. Still, it's a big day, so I get that it might take awhile to get things in place. Hope the freeplay goes well for the new ones.
---
The servers are just down right now.
---
Sort by New
---
Guaranteed the new matchmaker they whipped up for NW is not playing nice.
---
I mean this pvp experience is different to survival and adventure pvp where its about build gear skill. This mode is literally just player skill only. Which I like now all the players who were complaining about not having good gear can do pvp in br mode. By the sounds of it its practicle to take a lvl 1 character in and not be disadvantaged.
---
I do kinda wish your special stats mattered therefore your build mattered but meh. Keep survival as an option for players to kill each other with op gear and this way everyone is happy there is a mode that caters to all.
---
Yeah you were banned from duping or purchasing duped items
---
Check Twitter or Bethesda‚Äôs website.. server isn‚Äôt up so you can‚Äôt log in
---
We just want you to wave back :(
---
Are you being deliberately thick?
---
Servers are currently down to the new update that just came out. That is the server maintenance message thinf
---
Or... could be maintenance. JUST a guess.
---
yall smell like shit
---
you're probably right..the NPCs will start the quest line then mostly be uninvolved I'm assuming
---
I've only seen the first three episodes but it seems even weirder than the original
---
I have seen enough videos to see what kind of buggy mess this game is and how bethesda is still making money with such a trashy game.
---
You need to do a quest chain which is a bit boring. It‚Äôs starts on top part of the map with scouts. Easier to search on the net then explain.
---
Oh. I skimmed though it since I was eating lunch, so I probably missed that. However, the way you're describing this donation box still seems kind of impractical to me. The Newbie's camp position could affect visitors, and if the flow of visitors is low it would affect such donations. Maybe if there was an icon for these boxes being present at Camps just like player vending it might work, but I'm not sure if it would get that much traffic.
---
Another option would be to place such a stash by vault 76 for such donations. High levels can only place things in the box, starting from 50+. Then, low levels could pick up such items coming straight out of the vault.
---
Hmm. Didn't expect to be downvoted for just saying I'd like to explore a new vault without battle royale but that's fine. Is it confirmed that the vault will be open even without joining the new mode? Great if true. Not complaining about BR mode; I just don't want to do it myself.
---
I still think they should expand Rose's Raider Radio into a full radio station. She already has a number of Raider-centric PSAs.  Add a few more of those and swap in the Appalachia Radio music for the elevator muzak, and you'd be there.  We already have the hijack-the-airwaves storyline in hand. 
---
MODUS would also be a good choice, for similar storyline reasons.  I imagine that could work well with the generically patriotic marches from FO4 Minuteman radio.
---
Anyone know of any actual holdup for adding new music?  Is it a matter of copyright issues/royalties?  Or increasing the download and/or ultimate file size?
---
You suck. Post your gamertag so I can nuke your base.
---
KEK just opened it and servers are up, GOGOGO
---
It's back online!
---
Okay thank you
---
3hours for me. And i will be waking up for work in 10hours, not much time.
---
This one maintenance is extremly long, maybe there is some problem.
---
Nope. It gives instructions for new players to create a character first.
---
Ooh!  Message me.  I have a few jobs for you.  I pay good caps.
---
There is a megasloth cardboard target datamined - not sure if it will do anything other then stand there
---
This is just so funny reading.
---
I‚Äôm thinking of getting it, what platform my man?
---
same here, not long now though as they have changed the news box and maintenance is normally 3 hours long . I recon about 6:30 they will be live.
---
The point of the mode is to be skilled base. The only level playing field is the level of entry. Everybody starts at zero in terms of equipment. Everything after that is up to player skill and a bit of chance.
---
The point isn't to provide an equal experience for everybody. The mode wouldn't be competitive in that case. Not everybody is going to be a top player. You either learn to get better, or accept your limitations and play for fun. That's what they mean when they say, "Get gud."  
---
If you feel like you getting better is a lost cause and that impacts your ability to have fun with the mode, don't play it. Simple as that.
---
That's the spirt.. I'm walking my dog to the beach till I hear news
---
How do I join?
---
If your on xbox I can help you im a avid 76 player my Gt is Talal8812 hit me up
---
I'm going to hand put herbivore mutations, just to promote a meat free wasteland ;)
---
This post gave me a headache.
---
What are the limitations on the trial
---
Very. Reminds me of FO3. I know 4 essentially had the same tune as 3 but I like the dramatic sci-fi feel, which this also has.
---
By chance did they give you a way to fix it? Or was it a problem on their end they need to correct? I'm  having same problems and cannot verify my account.
---
Ah! The solution I proposed! :D
---
I could see something like this tied into mailboxes, where another player could just leave something in your mailbox.
---
The reselling of cheap items meant for low-levels is a real thing, but that's just how it is.  I plan to have a vending machine for newbies filled with cheap things like Fire Axes and other basic, easily craftable weapons.
---
Guys! Stash your guns, and stuff in case there's a glitch and items disapeer

Damn you!!

---
Perhaps explain how you feel that Bethesda is raping the Fallout franchise and how 76 is an abomination? Claiming such and then attacking the community as them being the ones in the wrong is a surefire way to be greeted by animosity.
---
It is well known that many people did not support Interplay's decision to sell the Fallout intellectual property, but whats done is done and lets face it; the franchise wouldn't might not be around today had Bethesda not bought it. Just think if Bioware bought it and how much their last few big releases flopped. Would you rather the Fallout franchise end with an Anthem-esque flop of a release?
---
Lets face it, at least this isn't another flatliner like Brotherhood of Steel.
---
iT'S LIVEEE
---
I'm more interested in how the factions will fill out. Raiders returning, brotherhood...etc.
---
Also! Happy cake day!
---
Not kn xbox
---
&gt;For free...so I didn't pay $60 for this game?
---
No, you paid $60 for Fallout 76 at the time you bought it, every thing after is free.
---
Hmm.. Still nada on my Xbox üòê
---
Im doing this as well but for xbox gotta show these new players what our community is all about
---
Shhhh don‚Äôt ruin the fun with telling people who won‚Äôt read updates they are banned for duped items ü§£
---
"...I'm going off the rails on the crazy train...."
---
You can play in squads of up to 4 people if you want.
---
&gt;"Was/is" is not a speculative response. It's literally stating "it was and is...".
---
&gt;Don't backslide. Own your shit.
---
No it's not, not to me at least, the / is an OR not an AND. My bad if you interpreted it that way.
---
&gt;Not my job to convince e you of shit. 
---
I don't think you understand how adult conversation works. It's usually about the exchange of ideas. Especially here on reddit when we are in hyper-focused subreddits and individual threads. So I am not sure why you are even engaging me when you aren't trying to change my opinion?
---
time to put all my shops floating off a cliff
---
This isn't some internet or PC limitation thing. Anyone that plays on PC experiences these issues. Having the client freeze from clicking a radaway randomly, or the "server not responding" to 10 seconds later being dropped along with all of your friends from the server crashing isn't a client-side issue.
---
I get I get to be as popular as herpes in a monastery due to posting in what is essentially a F076 cheering section of reddit, but things actually did start working good in march as they were ironing out the server issues, you could hold onto a server for a long duration, and many of the game breaking issues overall were really starting to be smoothed out.
---
To be fair, the full crashes to desktop (CtDs) made progress in the last patch as that doesn't happen regularly now to myself or those I play with, but the rest still 8 months down the road are still the norm.
---
I have PS plus
---
If this is a troll post, I‚Äôm coming for OP first
---
Edit: Confirmed up on PS4
---
Are you on xbox? if so I would love to help any new players.
---
I don‚Äôt get it, have one but it breaks in less than 50 shots. Useless for any boss battle. Is everyone using repair kits now?
---
Literally the first Thing iam doing now
---
No, I'm 40
---
They are up on ps4
---
It's not, I'm not seeing the download either.
---
&gt;I haven't played since the week this game came out and I'm kind of excited to play it again.
---
Wow... you've missed a lot. A LOT!!
---
One sec
---
I'm in. Ps4
---
FO76 is absolutely not a min-max game. I mean, you *can* play it that way for crazy damage numbers and insane defense etc, but you don't have to do that. Here's a few tips for ya:
---
1 - You can't permanently break your character. All choices can be reversed, with enough levels, and leveling is very easy. With the ability to perk-swap, most choices don't even need levels to sort out tbh.
---
2 - Power armor is your friend. It offers amazing benefits, particularly earlier in the game - no fall damage (ever), strength of 11 regardless of your Special (carry weight!), very good damage reduction for ballistic, energy and radiation, and mods which complement most playstyles. Also some sweet skins. It's also accessible. Of course you can move to legendary non-power-armor later if you wish.
---
3 - Don't underestimate quality of life perks. If I was stripped of my perk cards and allowed to keep only a small selection, Travelling Pharmacy would be pried from my cold dead fingers. Chems and Stimpacks are HEAVY! There are many others, including Travel Agent and Hard Bargain which are also invaluable.
---
4 - Upgrade your weapon reasonably often. There is a significant difference between a level 10 weapon and a level 40 weapon.
---
5 - Take some weapon perks, but don't be afraid to mix and match early-game. It's fine. You'll settle on what feels right eventually, and then you can just swap in the perks you need for it.
---
6 - Armor penetration perks are probably more important than weapon damage perks (arguable, and not an issue until you're closing on 50).
---
7 - Junk junk junk. As much as you can collect. Just pick up absolutely EVERYTHING until you're full, then scrap it and stash your junk. When you start to have too much, make a vendor machine and sell the crap you don't want at 1 cap per piece - you won't worry about caps again.
---
8 - Explore! Some areas are dangerous, yes, and you might well find yourself in a higher level zone by accident. It's fine....this is where the adventure gets exciting, right? :) Stash reasonably often and iif you die, you don't lose much. You'll pick up quests, waypoints and you'll have fun.
---
9 - Take your time!!! This is not Diablo 3 where there's no game until end game. Appalachia is big, and there's something out there for every level. Have fun with it....listen to the holos, read the notes, hack the terminals. It's a rich world.
---
10 - Learn the game in Adventure Mode. Survival is fine, if you know what you're doing, but it's beyond brutal for a newbie.
---
11 - Don't let griefers put you off. They're in the minority by an order of magnitude, and most of us are pretty friendly. If someone is bullying you, report them if you can, and then hop server. No need to tolerate it.
---
12 - Don't beg for free stuff, but give a thumbs up if you get it. We're a generous bunch here, but many are a bit allergic to "Hi, can I have 12000 free 5.56mm ammo and a two-shot explosive handmade? Oh, and some caps and stimpacks. Say 5000 of each. Thx".
---
There are about 900 more tips that I'm currently not thinking of, but hope these help :)
---
Ist.
---
The vault tec one right?
---
I would love to see some new camp stuff to really add to the creativity that people come up with. I've always wished they would expand on the power connectors a little bit so we could come up with more contraptions.
---
This right here.
---
Sweet. Thanks for posting for us at work. Any update on the elder coat?
---
THANK YOU BROO
---
Tbf that drunk dude at e3 did not help what so ever
---
If you've never played then why are you here - why do you care. Despite the bugs - of which there are many - this is still a truly fun game that keeps us all coming back. There are tons of people enjoying this game. How about trying it and forming your own opinion instead of just parroting some Youtuber who gets paid for shock value and click bait :)
---
I think it would be a cool idea to have set as something that you take over, if you control it then you can decide the host/what music to play. If another person doesn't like your type of music selection then they can try and claim it for themselves and you can either defend it or let it go if you're not into PvP. You can also have like a defense event against Super Mutants so that they can host the radio show.
---
I know most people aren't in to PvP so maybe even make it a cool down so that once someone controlled it for like 30 min it allows someone else to claim it, first one to claim gets the dibs for that next 30 min. You also can't claim it back to back unless a certain amount of time has passed and no one else has claimed it.
---
Ill add you my IGN; VaynesBond
---
You mean clickbait. Those guys make me sick like some of the subs on reddit. You can't even post any truth anymore, it gets strait censored or drowned out by sperm donor babies.
---
Of my brother my brother and me fame, it‚Äôs a major podcast
---
Shot in and around my CAMP next to the Top of the World in the Savage Divide, at the unmarked ‚ÄòGlastonbury Grove‚Äô in the north east of the map... and the Watoga High School stage!
---
Yeah I think that will be interesting as well - and I've always kind of thought about Ghouls as their own kind of faction - like the ghouls in Underworld in 3. They've never really seemed to be an official faction but they definitely have that feel for me.
---
Anger! Outrage! Pitchforks!

Hey I took a shower already chill

But grain in ans of it self needs processing.  You dont just eat a stalk of grain you need to mull it dont you?
---
I just wanna  be the Doom Slayer of Fallout. Is that too much to ask?
---
I have not! Totally know where I'm heading the moment the servers come back online!! :-)
---
They‚Äôd never do that, if just shoot his inside out dick.
---
Remember that junk, chems, food, ammo and plans all have weight, my first port of call would be the Pack Rat perk to take the edge off the junk you pick up, and make sure you make use of your stash box üëçüèª
---
lol no
---
PS4 is up! Gotta go to work in 10 mins so can‚Äôt do NW. :(
---
At least I get to sell my stuffs to get my 1400 caps
---
Unfortunately I dont remember the reasons between perma and temp bans. I might have combined a few threads then. I do remember quite a bit of cheaters posting their repsonses to their tickets only for a few Bethesda people commenting that it thier claims were wrong and explaing to everyone else why they were really banned.
---
I do remember a few innocent victims getting their bans lifted but I thought the 900 guy had gotten a perma ban which was confirmed by a bethesda employee.
---
I dont remember them mentioning that last night
---
Kill laugh love
---
Sounds like an issue with your console
---
Okay awesome :) and if no one looks in there, it would still be there?

"What's up Wastelanders this is Black Bear! Coming at you live from wild Appalachia! Don't forget to appreciate those rhododendrons because even though the radiations killing you, the plants can't get enough!"

So something is wrong with your ps4 drive and you are getting the login error everyone is getting that indicates the server is down for maintenance which is also shown as an announcement in the top right of your screen?
---
Never heard of them.

Definitely!

Just drop or scrap everything you don‚Äôt immediately need

Off to enjoy an anniversary dinner :) hope to come back to it working haha
---
Well, Battle Royales have never been my thing, but it sounds like an interesting limitation.
---
You‚Äôre all angry for no real reason though. Just play the game or go away, it‚Äôs pretty simple.
---
Oh look it‚Äôs not fixed.
---
I have a Furious+faster swing speed flaming pitchfork I could sell you for a few thousand caps if you want.
---
They‚Äôre starting up fachnat?!
---
So they could use the song
---
Design your character. Then head out and do some shit. Build stuff. Kill stuff.
---
I would rather the game had faded into obscurity than turn into an opern world shooter.Bethesda Fallouts use a great setting as a backdrop for a "roleplaying" game that has nothing to do with roleplaying.
---
Its also very clear from the putrid stuff people are spweing at me that a more diplomatic approach would have meant just a much slower death to this thread without leaving a single dent in this echo chamber.
---
I forget the perk name but theres one that reduces chems weight. I use it and it's really useful.
---
Xbox servers are up people say but it‚Äôs not for me
---
Just feed them, invite to a team, and fast travel to Fissure Site Prime.
---
I had this problem when i switched from the beta to the release version. I must have uninstalled and reinstalled 4 times (with updates).  I must hate myself for continually buying this crap
---
I'm just afraid of getting rid of some things since idk if I'll find things as easy later on
---
With a full unyielding set you can get +15 charisma that said a full set will probably be like 3k-5k caps
---
Oh I love Vault Babies. They are usually a ton of fun and very grateful for the help.
---
New physical copies all platforms $17 on Amazon
---
Straight out of the vault, you should head to Cranberry Bog and fight a Scorchbeast.
---
Haha I thought that too. I have a feeling the cosmetics earned in NW will be pretty dope.
---
That means servers are down. Once everything is back up you‚Äôll be able to log on.

its your PS fam, delete this

1. In Adventure mode? No not at all.
---
2. Yes its a decent looter shooter exactly like fallout 4 if you've played that.
---
3. Games been getting major bug fixes since release I don't see that stopping now.
---
Just got in my first game... HYPE!
---
They are!!! Thank you for confirming!
---
Pretty good stuff, looking forward to giving Bethesda my dollars
---
Focus on exploring but try to Interact with the community One of the nicest community in any games.Try going for base building and do follow the main quest as it will tie into wastelanders
---
Right on, yeah I'd wouldn't mind checking that out. üëç
---
Apparently level doesn't matter though. Unless I'm reading the patch notes wrong (I might be).
---
Fallout servers are down for maintenance maybe? It‚Äôs not specific to Xbox. Xbox in general is fine I‚Äôm sure.
---
A helpful haiku to get you on the right path:

"Drop your junk my man,

I've been playing around two months now, with ~300 hours in the game, and I've had less than a handful of server crashes or CTD in that time. Xbox, for what it's worth.
---
It's up :)
---
Its still in maintenance are you on xbox
---
I will take it when I get it working. That should take at least 4 or 5 days
---
How are you at your cap limit? I can't seem to get enough caps myself. What's your secret?
---
Most things are easy to restock, especially ammo and aid type items.
---
Lucky hole mine wear excavator power armor to farm lead. Uranium fever event to farm steel. And gunpowder: acid and cloth. There is a map of resources locations. Lead, steel, gunpowder to craft your own ammo. Or buy these items or ammo from player vendors whom specialize in crafting ammo.
---
Haha wise words indeed. I can feel the unrelenting wisdom flowing through me üòÇüòÇ.
---
Idk i feel really good about sticking withthis game.    I have been playing since beta..and although thw road was a litgle rough every now and then..the +/- on this is so much in the + column to me. I remember when the stash was 400, when my tse collection got wiped in a fast travel glitch, when i scrapped my excavator armor while scrappibg inaide west tek..when you could farm watoga..the list goes on and on and on..idk. This game had given me something i dont think any game has before. Dont tell me you necer fucked around in highschool. The game was a lost kid fuxkin aroubd doin dumb shit for a few months. Been there. But you getthrough it. And now your better off because of it. Thats my take. This game is good. Its a good game. I dont think i ever played a single game this many hours. That tells you something.
---
Curious about something. I have the "physical" edition coming by tonight from amazon.
---
If I start the trial right now, when I get my code do I just redeem it and I'm good to go. Or will I need to wait till the free trial is over? If you do know, PC btw
---
I saw a popup in the Bethesda Launcher for the free trial.
---
Ahaha tbh I haven't had him "Awkward Travis" for long, I guess if I don't transform him there will be thousands of lines I haven't heard.
---
So that was you!!! Lol
---
Oh I def have that one, might have it equipped already
---
Finding a nice pace between rushing and taking your time. Make sure you don‚Äôt grind events just for the materials because if you don‚Äôt buy the game it‚Äôs wasted time. However, try not to rush through everything so that if you do buy the game there is still plenty to explore (there will be even after a week of playing regardless). 
---
Just immerse yourself in he world, look for cool places to build a camp, and find strangers nice enough to point you in directions as well as set you up with some ammo or food.
---
It's the color of babyshit...
---
Wew, I can kite enemies and maximize the damage they do to camps much easier now
---
Sam Elliot would be perfect for the host!
---
Yeah
---
Not that big tbh
---
5.38Gb
---
I would rather sit through 20 minutes of nonstop SB sonic attacks than look at Bethesda's IG comments.
---
Selling serums daily to vendors gets you the daily cap amount.
---
Over 5gb I believe
---
Okay, well scrapping like I never seen before it is haha
---
That isn't true at all. There are tons of posts asking for this that or the other thing to be fixed. Normally with lots  of discussion about how it could be fixed, or why people think it hasn't been fixed. 
---
If you're not seeing any of that, then you're only seeing what you want to see.
---
This whole time I had to update it
---
It's still not out yet. They just finished updating the game and servers so wait like another hour or 2 and you should see it.
---
wtf could possibly make you think they would just suddenly just add a single player only thing to a game that was marketed for being multiplayer
---
I had mules with max cap
---
&gt;gonna get delayed then everyone is mad
---
Simple solution is just stop telling the public what is coming... Like really that will work .. ya I know...
---
(I'm an old player) My dad was "hell no, I don't want a multi-player version of this..." While playing FO3/4 over and over...  But I bought him his copy of FO76.. made him play with me. Well now he's at level 39 and says "Hell, ya this really IS much better" ... "I should have listened to you.."
---
He is 78.  The point is FO76 is downright awesome and only problems it really has is the stability.
---
So here's the thing.
---
I bought 76 over a month ago and have been playing it for 4-5 hours every week. Its an ok game that keeps me entertained. I'm sure you will enjoy it too.
---
But well let me give an example. I sold you a car and its craps out  after 2 months. I apologize humbly and ask for forgiveness and even promise to slowly over the course of weeks/months/years fix that car. Does that make it ok? Maybe, I'm acknowledging the issues and trying to fix them. Does it make it ok when I knew the car would crap out in 2 months before I sold it to you and did a cost/benefit analysis and realized that it'd still be profitable for me to sell you the lemon and eventually fix it slowly as as I continue receiving a trickle of money from you even after the initial sale of the car?
---
That's what Todd did. He/Bethesda knew their game was a fuck up and still went ahead with the sale instead of fixing it and pusing back the release date.
---
I know I'm on /r/fo76  so i'll get downvoted for sure but fuck todd.
---
You could be right.  When I read that in the patch notes, I'd assumed it was just a bit of humor, but maybe it really was directly referring to people putting nukashine in them.
---
That‚Äôs fine. It‚Äôs great for outrage -and- jumping to conclusions, seems a perfect fit.
---
Damn I wish I could assist you on your travels.
---
All I can say is this...
---
Stay in Forest region (green area) and level up to 10 before going to toxic valley or ash heap (up north and down south on West side)
---
Collect everything and scrap every weapon unless it's your level. Try sell some items at times to collect caps.
---
Don't build too much. Build a small 3 X 3 home near water.
---
Carry water and food with you. Don't throw out items unless it's fat man's or missiles for ammo.
---
Find other players within the same level.
---
Have fun and explore.
---
Turn pacifist mode on to prevent griefers.
---
If someone follows you and annoys you, server hop. Quit to main menu and hop back in.
---
No, you can't. But you can get free atoms in game, so use those?
---
In some parts of the world it sure has been recently.
---
Great, thanks for the quick reply. Enjoy nuclear winter!
---
I could try the clean but this only happens with Bethesda software.
---
Yeah, Fallout will always be my favorite franchise no matter the bugs and errors it has.
---
Should be free for all platforms for a week.
---
WAIT... Hancock could technically be in it, he is after all a ghoul who has been alive since the war! But just a less cool and a little more insane because of the waiting for people to re-populate the world thing.. or would that make him more cool.. I'm not sure
---
Isn't that every other day?
---
You may be right,  i may be crazy!
---
Make another character. Move over your gear your saving to that one. As you get better you can organize them. One for weapons. One for junk. One for ammo and chems. You get the point.
---
I have to update now and i couldn‚Äôt before
---
Taste the Rainbow!
---
No... when they add the parade... it didnt get started till 6pm
---
[Dog (and God) ](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Dog_and_God) already exist and I don't think he's a good radio host.
---
It will be free on all platforms
---
Yeah but don‚Äôt be too upset at those people, because the wasteland I have seen was always willing to welcome back, or welcome for the first time, a fellow vault dweller.  If I could have anything happen to them, it would be to spare them from unfair criticism too.  You never know, they may have been unfairly criticized before themselves.
---
Do we have to disable mods before launching the game to play Nuclear Winter?  If so the new game mode is going to be a pass for me.
---
Yep, pretty much half of the musician objectives still won't even pop.
---
Anyone knows why I'm level 1?
---
I was higher
---
Brotherhood skin for the minigun :o
---
Sounds deadly
---
Absolutely this. I didn't realize when I first started, but every weapon and armor you scrap has a chance of unlocking a mod for that item. Early on, scrap *everything*!
---
Agreed, also, many of the live service MMO's start out the same way. ESO and TOR are my major examples. Both started off with an okay launch, but are now SUPER popular. Both (moreso TOR kinda) evolved a story line over the course of years, F76 is doing the same thing.
---
your comment has no point here.
---
Yeah there's a quest where a guys wife is a non feral, he ends up killing her. In fo4 the sub commander was sane, maybe put them down with the mole miners and make a back story for the legendary vendor.
---
Nevermind got it. Had to restart the bethesda launcher and now it says install instead of buy.
---
I bought the dartboard and have 3 lined up on a wall for target practice. I wish it registered damage numbers or let me play darts with a crossbow
---
Wait, so is purchasing a serum recipe and selling them a viable option for making caps?
---
Don't start in Survival.
---
I could see that if it was digital. But an update effecting the disc???
---
ZOMG! So many people..
---
Before anyone stresses over the need to respec, it appears that the speech checks are for multiple SPECIAL stats. So you can clear dialogue checks if your charisma is too low. 
---
If that is how it's implemented, I would say it's the ideal system. You get the reward of passing the check but the details depend on what type of character you are. Plus there are chems and other boosting items.
---
My suspicion is that none of the cards you earn in BR will be usable in adventure. You only have 7 slots (1 per SPECIAL), so I'm guessing that they'll be condensed versions of the perks from the base game. For example, 1 single card that reduces all ranged weapon weight, 1 card that provides the benefits of Pharma Farmer, Can Do, and the other "find extra stuff in containers" perks.
---
They also mentioned a perk card called "Frog Legs" that increases jump height, so there may be other cards that mimic other mutation effects as well.
---
Correct.
---
Team placement,
---
Time survived ,
---
Placement xp,
---
Player killed,
---
Players downed,
---
Ai kills,
---
Elite ai kills,
---
Nukes launched revives
---
All contribute to your overseer xp
---
Do the quest and kill Travis. That kid selling water in Diamond City takes over and is great
---
I see what you did there;)
---
I just tried on PC.  It lets me into the Atom Shop and check the Social tab so I assume it would let me into the game as well.
---
Every time! Only with Bethesda.
---
lol barbie stuff. ok bro.
---
Huh, so PC players would have to play the game like every console player. That would, uh, that would be terrible. I'm sure.
---
Edit: yes, I am jealous of load out mods...
---
Or at least temporarily incapacitating
---
Ah...hello fellow one of 10.  :P
---
I don't imagine the servers are flooded, I've never had issue joining a friend's game if I wanted to, and I don't know I'm not on today and probably won't be.  I don't think there's a whole lot they could do just starting out.  The only griefing methods I can really think of would involve other high level players.
---
SARCASM
---
Thanks lad!
---
I cant believe how many people dont play the game and just chug their favorite youtubers ball sweat while spewing out their copies opinions.
---
Worlds worst luck then!
---
I'm gunna guess the first time human NPCs appear it's going to be somewhere that gets nuke immediately.
---
The ftp players are all low
---
Its not free yet. Sometime today. Please sort a reddits posts by new next time. Answers can usually be found before you need to make a post.
---
Been there since launch.
---
thats a relief, i'll see you in the storm friend &gt;:)
---
" **Vending:** When Fast Traveling to a C.A.M.P. players now spawn near the owner‚Äôs Vending Machine, rather than near the center point of the C.A.M.P.‚Äôs build radius. "  
---
Thanks Bethesda! You made it even easier for me to kite spawned enemies to player CAMPs and maximize the damage done. On top of that, I can now optimize my trap setup at my own CAMP to kill even more players.  
---
It's like they specifically want us to do it to generate a cap sink. I'll do my part :D
---
If you compare the 76 launch to a single player game, it was rough, to be sure, but we've had worse launches.  We've had worse launches from games named Fallout.
---
If you compare the 76 launch to online games, the fact that most people were able to actually log in makes it a rather  successful launch.  
---
No one remembers bad launches, expectations were set properly, and we've had steady improvements since.
---
Make sure you are on Passive Mode until you learn the game.
---
Yes you have nothing and need to find everything.
---
Whether the game is good or bad is subjective, but on release it was objectively an unfinished and bug-riddled mess. Even for Bethesda standards.
---
Vault 51 skins should be reward from NW.
---
well, GI JOEs?  
---
Cosmetics, whatever, I've always called it barbies.
---
The clean billboard is a great idea - can't wait to see all the creative ways these get used!!
---
The free week trial is the full game. So if you want, you could not use/open the one you bought until you figure out if you like the game.
---
Yeah... I sort of mentioned that already.
---
Basically OSRS when it launched on mobile
---
If you're friends then you can join their server. Isn't that the same thing?
---
I guess you are üòÇ our battle will be epic.
---
No the game will be free for one week for those that don't currently own it.
---
No the full game is free to try for the next week. I am not sure if that includes the Nuclear Winter thing or not though.
---
there ahould be a 1/1000 chance of being teleported to a skyrim intro when we get NPCs, and then you get attacked by a scorchbeast
---
My gt Is Talal8812 if you need help
---
The mode is in sneak peek mode, it will be removed after the week. The whole game, including nuclear winter, is free for a week
---
It is for me. Some serums take more common materials, but they all require at least one type of flux. See here for more information: https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Category:Fallout_76_serum_recipes
---
The Hard Bargain 3 perk can get you up to 450 caps for selling one serum.
---
Are you scrapping and storing your junk? Scrapping your waste armor and weapons? You need to scrap them to learn mods, so you should be scrapping pretty much everything. 
---
Sell aid items you don't need. I normally only keep a few of the chems I use, and sell the rest. Stimpaks and stuff of course I hold onto more of.
---
Checking the server status and threads here would have helped you realize what's going on...
---
I'll put it to you like this, the scenery and world of Fallout games has always been a selling point, and adding human NPCs isn't going to take away from that.  If anything, I think you will probably like it as the quest systems in previous Fallout games are superior to the current implementation in pretty much all regards, from 3 to NV to 4.  You won't be any more required to partake in the new content, but it will be there whenever you're ready.
---
they are running it for a week while the free trial of the full game is going on.. then back into the dev shop to fix all the stuff that needs fixing before they roll it out for another test or for good...
---
None of the new content is going to change the base game. You can still do what you‚Äôre doing.
---
I do find it pretty strange no additional trophies has been added at all. I would have liked to have seen what they would have put up there for Wild Appalachia and what they can do in the future.
---
Dammit.. is that what keeps  moving in the bushes???
---
10$ for 1500 atoms, repair kits, and an outfit. Is definitely worth. You're really getting your moneys worth.
---
So far with my lurking, it reminds me of the ESO community. ESO had a similar rocky perception by gamers but once I myself hopped on I loved it, community is super nice too!
---
I think you only need to have five to get the max effects of a junkies weapon (+50% damage), but you're right - that still some serious drug abuse.  You don't get to be a serious junkie without some hard work.
---
Thanks I didn't see that and it's pretty much what I was looking for.
---
If you already own the game it will be free for ever. If you don't all the FO76 will be on free week including the Nuclear Winter, after that you need to purchase the game to keep playing!
---
Why is it making me redownload the whole game
---
Are you trying to convince me or you?
---
There are few items that you CAN scrap that you will want to have unscrapped, and none that I can think of in the early game.
---
I'm well into endgame, and I utilize the 'scrap all' button at workbenches multiple times a day.  You'll be best served to scrap all, and store all junk in your stash at every convenient opportunity.
---
Scrap is used for building C.A.M.P items, and for building and repairing weapons and armor *almost* 100% of the time.  It rarely does you any good to carry scrap around with you (and it's accessible any time you are at a workbench or stash box anywhere in the world).
---
This conversation didn't involve you. Please make both our days better, and keep it that way.
---
Thanks.
---
I always though they gonna do it. Pure logic.
---
Ahhh, thanks for that. I wasn't aware of that since this was my first attempt at taming. Makes sense now 'tho, as i have tucked my CAMP unit neatly under the stairs where the animal was stuck.
---
I need not convince myself of anything
---
No. Finding people selling serums under 400 caps and buying all of them is the viable option.
---
Ah, I see now.  It's just a fixation.  My bad.
---
One dude's got a lit stick of dynamite, that's cool.
---
By the ground, and the topography, I'm thinking Savage Divide somewhere?  It's not flat like the Cranbog or the Mire, and there's a few more plant lookin' bits than the ash heap but not enough for forest.  But there's not much detail, hard to say if my observations are relevant.
---
I'd love a few of them. Maybe one thats an AI, one thats super mutant, like in Nee Vegas, and one Wastelander. Maybe have events where they compete over radio towers?
---
I saw Hellfire Armor and the Anti-Materiel rifle in that trailer, so it's a long shot but those might both be.  And as a rifle user and lover of NV, I want that rifle and will play whatever game mode I have to long enough to get it.
---
one drink and you'll forget you read it...
---
No posts about it because u delete
---
Can someone more familiar with apple tell me how I can get this on my android phone? I swear apple users are wired entirely different because wtf this store.
---
Just hire the McElroy boys as the hosts and have them air from the irradiated ruins of Huntington (which should totally be fucking added to the game, just saying Bethesda). Trav can be a super mutant, Justin can be a ghoul, and Griffin can be a robobrain - it'd be perfect.
---
I mean i remember the launch...its a main reason why i didnt buy it. And its a big reason why people give the title shade.
---
Looking forward to playing it later today though to see what they have accomplished
---
I stuck it out on and off the entire time. I like the game alot. A big part of continuing to play is having friends to play with imo.
---
Oooooh, ok . I missed Fachnat
---
Link?
---
people with trapped camps are going to have to rethink their layouts.. lol
---
I bet if there were a dupe connected to it somehow they would hotfix it lol
---
You're discounting the fact, that many raiders may just be douches IRL as well.
---
Eveyone knows "that guy" at the office, or has some mouthy, racist, misogynistic nephew/cousin/uncle. They play games too.
---
Thank you. I want to try it out but am far too lazy to stash. This is awesome news.
---
Waves In a stagnant pool?? I see an active community attributed to an active game roasting maybe one of the saddest toxic reddit members alive? You made me feel good about my life reading your comments, seeing how much of a depressing, negative, uninformed, unaware, probably uneducated, sad, sad state of a human you are. Do you find joy in making yourself look like an idiot time and time again? Because I bet you do big fella.
---
Gary?
---
Wrong... It did involve me as it was in a public forum. And quit being a whiner, play the game level up and enjoy!
---
non-patch days, between 30 mins and 90 minutes.  Patch days, like 2-3x that long.
---
Thanks! Out of curiosity which do you find easiest to make?
---
Might make a new game mode you can only unlock after beating the scorch beast main quest
---
It's live
---
I like the backpack and sniper rifle, the whole outfit https://webtoon-phinf.pstatic.net/20190607\_161/15599164607717o6hf\_JPEG/6329272a-7b7f-43a3-964b-f87b03ae415f.jpg?type=q90 
---
Awesome! I stopped after the second strip when I saw the sheepsquatch on the toilet though
---
If it's not your thing, that's fine. No need to talk shit, though. You might be cool with workbenches all over the ground. Some of us like building neat structures.
---
Took the words out of my mouth.  üòÑ
---
I approve this idea.
---
Here's what u get:
---
https://imgur.com/VWmK0Pc

caps too!
---
And more than 3 songs.
---
There's a clean billboard?!  Awww shit time to start advertising my discount blueprints!
---
Isn't it a battle royale mode?
---
It's battle royale...................
---
So your best excuse now is that you were whining about something before having any information about it in the first place.
---
well its been 6 months and the way it was back then was that it said maintenance on the menu i didnt know it had changed my bad then lol
---
Stick with your team and crouch a lot. You won‚Äôt survive without your teammates.
---
Well i WAS going to have a stress free day.
---
So far this isn‚Äôt working with me anyway. I‚Äôm not spawning near machines. Are you?
---
That would be what a battle royale is.. so yes
---
You using mods? Inside the vault specifically says if using mods cannot access BR. This is to prevent anyone gaining an unfair advantage... like aim bots i think.
---
No, everyone starts with only a vault 52 jumpsuit, and 7 default perk cards
---
They're only adding to the game with this. The game you like playing isn't changing (at least not yet).
---
I've seen them more than once also at the hat spawn behind the whitepsrings service entrance.
---
Sneak peek, you can play it for a week. And it‚Äôs awesome.
---
This is Todd and company being mad at us as a community for being too nice in the apocalypse so they made us a game mode where we had to kill each other
---
Maybe a brotherhood station that reports the location of possible tech documents? And you return them to the radio host so they can send them to the superiors, maybe? Or it just spouts brotherhood propaganda or something, I honestly dont know. I bet this doesn't make a lick of sense. I'm tired. Ad Victoriam
---
Per the patch notes, no.  Everyone starts out with a set of special Nuclear Winter perks, although those can be upgraded the more you play Nuclear Winter.
---
And that's why I dont like Battle Royale.
---
But you are not vault 76 occupants, you are vault 51 occupants.
---
Thanks I'll have to try that.
---
Are they going to increase the volume on holotapes? Or at least give us a separate volume slider for holotapes?
---
When you leave once you die you dont lose xp, its usually if you quit mid match that you dont as is the case in all BR
---
didn‚Äôt ask for one weirdo
---
not likely.. I wouldnt hold my breath if I were you...
---
It sounded like it said you got to equip your cards.
---
If your not seeing it its because its not there
---
It should throw you on the main server then if you have me added you will push options then R1 then click on my name and join world üôå
---
How do you activate it in ps4 ?
---
which reminds me. I hope they make Rose a larger presence in the game and the leader of the Raiders. While I plan on siding with the settlers having Rose as a leader could convince me to use an alt character to play the Raider side.
---
Wastelanders isn't until Fall.
---
Lots of online games have rough launches that have faded from collective memory.  WOW, Diablo 3, GTA Online...  
---
I think online environments are just harder to QA.
---
I'd have a dozen enemies chasing me in a straight line any time I tried to walk anywhere... it didn't seem very interesting. I thought FO4 had great enemy AI.
---
It wasn't unfinished. It had a ton of bugs, but it wasn't unfinished. I was able to play the entire game all the way to the end. People tend to use "unfinished" to mean "I didn't like the state this game launched in".
---
That's what battle Royale is
---
I didnt talk shit at all.  I literally said you can scrap that stuff unless you want to play barbies, and you got mad cuz I called it barbies.  Then came round and picked a fight.
---
It's dollhouse barbies yo, which is fine.  Dont talk shit because you're mad about that.
---
What about Xbox I can't find it
---
Sure why not.
---
I wear unyielding armor, pretty much anything that can increase my strength, nerd rage, radicool, unarmed, and make sure you get all the mutations.
---
I simply added the game's exe file so that I could use my steam controller and didn't run into any problems, just that I have to sign-in every time I launch the game.
---
Have you tried launching the game in big picture mode? Also, make sure you have the in-game overlay turned on in the steam settings.
---
Dont worry. Keep doing you, at least until November, but dont sweat it.
---
Battle Royale is a whole other game mode so that won't effect your explorations in slightest. 
---
As for this 'year 2', dont expect it to ruin your chance at this part of the story, or rest of current story. Bethesda is about long term playability and always being welcome to new players. Look at Elder Scrolls Online. They're on their like 38th expansion or something and it is still stupid easy to jump right in. Basically, however this shakes up in November, I'm comfortable saying it won't ruin your experience and style of play.
---
Trial run for just Nuclear Winter until June 17th. They didn't say when they will fully release Nuclear Winter yet.  Wastelanders will be released this Fall. No mention of a trial with that.
---
That's literally where I'm at. In FO4 it was sacred to have the items and now everyone is like just scrap it all lol
---
Ok. I missunderstood. I thought it meant you could use your normal perk cards OR the default nuclear winter ones, leveling them up along the way.
---
Aw nuts, you're right.
---
I had two girls gang up on me with their fists. It's a mad house out there.
---
Maybe that stick is so far up your ass that it's obscuring your vision
---
I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre reading my comment, I never said changes weren‚Äôt coming. What are you on about?
---
This is mentioned in the Patch Notes...  
---

This. I wish there was a purpose to rebuild Appalachia. Every time I am establishing a comms net for the Enclave I can‚Äôt help but wonder who the hell is going to be utilizing the net and it just feels like a waste. With human NPC‚Äôs there‚Äôs a reason to do things; without them, you‚Äôre stuck striving to make a world better for unfeeling automatons.
---
Wait... Fasnacht is back?
---
No idea as I'm at work.
---
I'm guessing restart the game after it updates then look on your title screen...
---
Nah. You should play less games. Spend the summer looking for love and improving you, not on a game.
---
That's why I bought it on PC. I play most games on consoles but I have a PC pretty much just for Fallout games.
---
I wanted new weather based mechanics like temperature and dryness causing status effects. :/
---
Team isn't on til later. I plan to just peek and die lol
---
A good question.  90% of the time when I get rad-worms, I'm on the driveway of the Whitespring, wearing Power Armor. Since Power Armor negates limb damage, I don't worry about it until I get out of the armor. But you probably know that. 
---
I honestly don't know if Adamantium Skeleton is the paper to Rad-worms rock, or if it is the scissors (or the lizard, but probably not Spock).
---
Yeah but ‚Äúprocessed‚Äù foods are chemically processed foods like cured hams, bacon etc.
---
Speaking of repairing items, how do we even go about that tbh
---
I'm kinda miffed they went back on the no human NPC's tho. I rather enjoyed the openness.
---
Could be someone camping and healing
---
You get a lot of CAMP plans from defending workshops, too. I'm not sure about Metal Walls, since I've had them forever, but I don't recall buying them? So maybe I got them from a Workshop defend.
---
Imagine that... well it IS a beta. :)
---
Well poop.
---
Hey just starting out myself! I‚Äôm on PS4 though, but I‚Äôd be more than happy to join some adventures with you if we‚Äôre on the same system!
---
Please never fix the bug that sometimes causes ghouls to slide across the ground like they are sleeping. That's so funny.
---
What is the goal of having so many?
---
 Just to have too many?
---
 That just seems like a lot of wasted stash space.
---
Nice collection though I guess.
---
I've definitely been scrapping junk weapons and all. Found that out recently with the mods lol
---
Check the search, ive seen some posts on how to do it on ps4 on here today
---
Fast forward to present day.. Do you not like what we have today? Personally I'm happy with it but am just constantly ranting about the stability and bugs.
---
I'm interested in what others think of where we are..
---
I am not sorry about being passionate about something I enjoy and voicing my displeasure in a clubhouse dedicated to kiddily fumbling the corpse of a once great series.
---
Nope not a single one
---
Can you help me I can't find the fucker on the Xbox stire the free trial just doesn't appear
---
Yup, my Husbando was out West deployed to the wildfires last year - hopefully this year won't be the same.
---
Which system? I'm trying to get the Xbox One version but the trail download still hasn't come.
---
Wait... did you read what it said
---
Wait what? So main point of DLC is here for a week? Then why the fuck did they publish the update
---
*store
---
Nah you're the crybaby here cause you're all butthurt that big bad Jim is daring to criticize your idol Bethesda/Todd Howard and your precious game that you probably spent 200 bucks or more on.
---
It's not a "piggy back" for attention jackass, your post certainly is though.  You just can't handle people actually criticizing this game.
---
I actually don't have an opinion of Fallout 76 because I have not bought it yet(i'm actually considering buying it now since Bethesda is now FINALLY putting shit in the game that should've actually been in there on launch and it's now FINALLY looking to start *gasp* an actual Fallout game! what a concept!)so real nice job on reading comprehension there shit for brains.
---
Boy you sure made a complete ass of yourself by jumping the gun and assuming stupid shit about me didn't you genius?
---
Why don't you go actually contribute to society instead of whining like a little fucking bitch on the internet whenever someone's opinion does not magically align with your own.
---
I saved you from yourself and changed everyone else's lives by putting an end to your asinine bullshit, you're welcome.
---
51 dwellers, 1 overseer
---
Lol its called addiction and i have professional drinker equipped... Dont worry lol
---
No I get you man, idk maybe it wasn't phrased well idk. But I can tell you the new combat feels super crisp, just played 4 matches of the BR, wasn't expecting much but I was very happily surprised
---
It‚Äôs actually very impressive. Glad they got rid of vats.
---
Not on PSN. Still a 50% off game at $29.99
---
It is. I love it haha
---
I like to find AFK characters and leave power armor frames in front of them...
---
Do you have to stay in the game till the end? As I just quit when I died... Was that a mistake?
---
51 residents in vault 51 plus one overseer on top of that.
---
Oh ok it‚Äôs still showing a price on the store
---
Sure dude, will wait. 7 you say?
---
What is the point of power armour in this mode since you can apparantly get one shot in it anyway all you are is  a bigger target with less speed
---
Will be starting on PS. Any early game tips?
---
‚ÄúGuy took out his six shooter and looked over at me.  He then looked back at the ground, and looked over at me again with that crazy look in his eye.  He cocked his gun, and pointed it about 3 feet in front of him, squatting down and up uncomfortably as he did so.  I‚Äôd never seen a guy squat this quickly, but then again I‚Äôd never been this far east of Watoga.  He began shooting at the ground and jumping around.  Growing up in the wasteland, you pick up a thing or two...and one of those is listening to the steel another gent has.  By my calculations there was only one bullet left in the chamber.  I could see it was meant for a paper bag, and that‚Äôs when I knew I better get the hell out of there!‚Äù
---
And when the Free States is completley unable to do anything to The Brotherhood and gets its ass handed to it I will be down for it
---
Are you scraping or storing?
---
no, you get it
---
What? I‚Äôm currently playing with three other randoms. The game matches you to form a 4 man team.
---
As a parent, I can only ask... How do you keep the kids from screaming?
---
Good idea
---
Nukashine with Cola Nut and the alcohol perk is pretty awesome... Until you black out.
---
Yeah, very nice, very fast paced.  
---
Also got killed after 2 minutes; my hunting rifle against opponent's SMG...
---
52... 13 groups of 4...
---
They would have had to have been sitting outside the circle for well over 5 minutes, which I should hope isn't possible but who knows.
---
If that is the case then I think the circle damage needs to be increased
---
I'm in the Free States, so I have no doubts about our ass-kickeryness-ness.
---
To stop the brotherhood, all we have to do is send some bats after them. Look how it turned out last time...
---
No you still have enough, as is indicated by your analytical process.
---
Like Three Dog, the Lord and master of all he survey?
---
Ya i‚Äôm on pc. I deleted and removed my mods and the issue persists.
---
IT seems to be broken for me too. It insta-exit after kill and ignored gun-fu.
---
If you try and solo this game and don't have a group of friends to run with I can see how it can get old fast. I ended up creating a Discord and got a group going...so our daily/weekly hangouts and group events have kept us all going. You should join a Discord group. It makes all the difference. :)
---
Today still means today. They didnt give a time
---
Jeez.... wish I'd known. Ive been sitting now for 15 min waiting in vain for another match to be found. This is not ideal.
---
Very good point! The quest to defend it from enemies (non players) always gives you about 2 minutes to ‚Äúprepare your defenses.‚Äù A quest that says ‚Äútake your workshop back from invaders‚Äù indicates that someone has started to contest your workshop.
---
EST :)
---
Don‚Äôt discount encounters.  They offer very good xp and loot
---
Also.  I can‚Äôt stress how critical a char build is before hand
---
You won‚Äôt be able to correct any mistakes till post level 50
---
Yes you can ,4 man teams
---
Update ini files, if not youll have to reinstall if youre not sure what files to fix
---
Yes...we can have a whole batch of Nukashine for them to partake in.
---
It had a ton of bugs, hence it was unfinished. You don't normally put out a product and release it in such a pathetic state as FO76 was at release and call it a finished product.
---
You need to be on the main menu with your friend then invite them to a team, then select play with team.
---
Oh god oh fuck i have 9 mutations what will i do
---
You have nothing but 7 perks equipped and as you level up you get more
---
Not at my console but usually you click on 'Buy' and it will go to the next screen showing the price of 'Free 7 day trial' or 'Free'
---
I am not mad at him at all. I still like Bethesda a bit. I haven't played in a while too. 
---
I just thought it was funny how everyone was asking for PLEASE NO BR! They were full damage control telling people there wasn't a BR mode after that one fake leak. Then at E3 the guy said something like WE LISTENED AND ADDED WHAT YOU ALL HAVE BEEN ASKING FOOOR! BATTLE ROYAAAALE! Reminded me exactly of the EA Play Battlefield V conference. 
---
At the end of the day it is a very bad direction for the game. All those wasted resources and time. Hopefully they made it and will just ditch it for people to play on their own time if they want. If they have a bunch of their people working on it AND the normal game then it might be time to just give up on 76 completely.
---
It's something to do lol. It started with the idea of having extra so that when I meet a random with a set that's not finished, i can give them the parts, and now its grown into this collection. And not a single one stays in stash, they're all on my person at all times. With portable power level 3 making them 75% lighter, if I use excavator with calibrated shocks, then I'm still getting a positive carry bonus. Only minimal space is wasted
---
That was a feature in update , I knew it was probably gonna interfere with gun fu the feature was it closes vats immediately after kill
---
Duct tape
---
Ooh yes, i unsubbed from r/fallout because most the people there are justy salty fucks, if somethibg isnt tailor made for them, they hate it, they hate everyone who made it and they hate everything it stands for, and they hate you for not hating it
---
Everyone starts equally in Nuclear Winter, mutations and items included.
---
But you‚Äôll get em back as soon as the game ends
---
Dramatic ass lmao
---
I have 2 XB's. You can just play one of mine until it's finished.
---
Your right. I'm looking forward to playing FO76 with my son and explaining some lore.
---
It's a mix bag for me. I haven't played any survival because it's not for me.
---
While not a BR fan looking forward to the bridging of this game for my son.
---
Not meant to be a shit on new game mode post. Just pointing out for me at least the BR gamemode has some plusses and minuses for me.
---
Keep an eye open for posters for a party at a frat house. Go to the party and drink. You‚Äôll thank me afterwards!
---
I *really* appreciate it!
---
Tbf, some of the backlash was deserved. The PC community at launch, the canvas bags, the Nuka Dark. Game still has issues to this day, but it's not nearly as bad as people say anymore
---
You have to invite to team in the menu. Then just press play with team
---
Just keep telling myself that 51 dead hopefuls plus one brand new overseer = 52 cause that started messing with my OCD as soon as I saw it lol üòÇ
---
Make sure your team is all at the main menu, then hit social &gt; invite to team
---
Yeah when I read it I was worried it would cause an issue.
---
Not even beta.  It is a sneak peek TO the Beta, before we even get into a beta. lol
---
You are right I deserve to be nuked.
---
I'll hurry, I promise!
---
Oh alright. Thanks!
---
Idk if he meant to. Probably just didn't know. It just blows my mind they added it. Before the game came out I was so paranoid of them making it a BR game. I don't want to spend all this money on a dumb BR. Never have never will. Once Pete said they have no plans and don't follow trends I was at ease and bought the game. We were deceived...
---
Shrek didn't deserve this
---
When you submitted a ticket did you actually get a ticket number? Mines been blank since yesterday
---
Yup, It's what separates a developer from a Great developer..
---
After watching their E3 announcement, yeah, me too.
---
It feels like we're actually having our cake and eating it too.
---
Just like in Fortnite, there is luck involved...finding the best guns/armour..etc.
---
From the picture and the teaser video it looks like the raiders take over the crashed space station.
---
... Tell me more.
---
When trying to join server it says: "Connection failed ESM/ESP mismatch". I guess its working as intended. Bethesda quality.
---
Fair assessment. As it stands now, it feels incredibly lonely. Is that a feeling we want forever as former vault dwellers? Don‚Äôt we want to see what we can build and sustain? Who we can meet?
---
Turn off your mods.
---
I really don't think they thought this trough for Gun Fu and VATS builds.
---
You didn't mention platform, so I'm going to guess PC, and further guess you're running mods or a custom ini.
---
Just a heads up, they actually increased the budget cost of neon billboards, what a shame..
---
See you out there, wastelander.
---
No, you‚Äôll understand it when you play. You have your own ‚ÄúStash‚Äù. It‚Äôs accessible at many places and you can build stash boxes at your camp and workshops. Any player can access them but they only see their own inventory. It‚Äôs simple when you see it. 
---
World containers aren‚Äôt static. You can theoretically hide something in them, but you‚Äôll probably never log back into the same server twice‚Äîso you‚Äôll never see that stuff again. 
---
Use the stash. Love the stash. Be the stash...or something like that.
---
I'm hoping the BoS are involved somehow.  Not sure if them being present, or at least a way to communicate with them and accomplish quests though.
---
I have the game still
---
üòû
---
Mine frozed out sadly.
---
Congratulations, you are the 3rd person to post this in the last 2 minutes. Today at some point
---
That's awful kind of you!
---
Your right I was being lazy so far to level 20 I‚Äôve just lived off of meat. I realized I need to add some veggies
---
They say the update went live like 40 minutes ago. But I‚Äôm not having any luck finding it either on XBox
---
They are suppressed just for the mode
---
Thatll most likely drop thursday, inside the vault
---
They're alt accounts, pig boy.
---
I wish they gave us option to choose. I had my spawn point all figured out and built my camp around it so players spawn directly in front. They get full experience, see my welcome sign. Grab some crops on the walk in..... now all that work is wasted if they just spawn somewhere else.
---
Don't get me wrong, great improvement overall. Just venting a bit since it didn't necessarily apply to me.
---
Tons of bugs ‚â† unfinished. Every game launches with a lot of bugs. There's a bug in Overwatch where if you get de-meched as Dva to a Reinhardt hammer swing, you see the mech death screen twice, once in game and the second time as a black screen. This bug has existed since the beta. Blizzard has said multiple times that they've fixed the bug, yet it's still present. Is Overwatch unfinished?
---
Don‚Äôt worry, 51 people die so it‚Äôs fine
---
&gt; Workshops are pvp zones regardless of mode. Pacifist mode or not if you claim a workshop players can, and frequently will, murder you for lolz. Best avoided if you're not the confrontational type.
---
I'd suggest new players prepare themselves for the idea that it might happen, but give it a try anyway.  There are some decent rewards for claiming and PVE defending, and workshop PVP isn't as common as it used to be.  Most people you meet at a workshop are just there to help with defense quests for XP and plans.
---
So.. you don't want the Vats Crit +50% to work on my lever action rifle, does that also mean you're willing to give up the Bloodied Effect on your weapons?
---
Think about what you're asking for, I see these  comments a lot, and it's always players asking for what they don't use or have to be nerfed.
---
I agree that some perks are very OP'd in this game, but the only way to even the playing field for everyone would be to eliminate all legendary effects in PVP modes.
---
This! It is a side game, don't get so worked up.
---
Yes, but the cards in nuclear winter aren‚Äôt carried over from Adventure/Survival and vice versa. You unlock perk cards form leveling inside Nuclear Winter.
---
One of my favorite interactions in survival happened the other day. I was just server hopping to look for magazines and outfits and I figured Survival might be a good place to do so as the focus is more on PVP. I was walking from Watoga to Fort Defiance. I am on my lower level who was about 57 at the time. I am running up the hill and I hear it... the heavy foot falls of someone in the bright yellow bus suit.. A wild level 70+... I looked at him and he looked at me... and then we just ran in the opposite directions xD I was sure he was gonna shoot me in the back but not this time!
---
No I don‚Äôt think I will
---
My custom controler mapping on xbox also reset.
---
I'm 46. My reflexes and eyesight just ain't what they used to be. The idea of playing a twitchy, hit-scan, jump 'n' gun game with a bunch of sugar-fueled 12-13 year olds, terrifies me in a way that is hard to explain.
---
Sorry it is PC you guessed correctly lol. I wasn't aware I had any mods on. What are you referring too? Do you mean on my actually character or?
---
The radium rifle is my new favorite.
---
also, stealth boys. Every. Time.
---
D:
---
Its something none of us expected. I have always had a charisma high build in the old Fallout's but obviously there wasn't a need for it in 76. A re-spec would be nice given how long it can take to move special points around.
---
i got it with my xbox and have yet to open it because of all of the early complaints.. i'm very tempted to try it now though
---
I worked for one place where I outright had to leave because "If you don't have a ticket for that.....You can't change it..." All Dev's have some level of joy to what they do. But a ticketing system can really kill that FAST..
---
Even changing a multi level if, if, if, if,,... etc to a switch would get kicked out at a code review.
---
In reference to the bow seen in the Wastelanders trailer. I just bought plans from the raider vendor for "Marquee Arrows". It said I learned it, but nothing is craftable (not surprisingly). Regardless, apparently the plans are there to be had.
---
Right downloaded the patch, then pressed play and now it wants me to download a 59.3GB file again. Everything was ok till this patch come out. Anyone else had this issue too ? I am on PC and on a sub 5mb ADSL connection so 59.3GB is going to take me a very long time to download.
---
In guessing yes because it did during the game's beta.
---
I have been playing for 3 weeks and not use to the other games f*ck off you didn't have to reponed
---
I should have specified PC. It'll run the game well enough to let the two accounts interact in-game.
---
welcome to BR
---
Haha poor thing was like "CAMP IS HOME" and you were like "please just go outside wild friend" oh man you've given me a genuine chuckle
---
No need to rub it in, I'm still in class
---
I just said that there was hate and controversy and backlash?
---
76 caps? They need to increase that.
---
it's battle royale..............
---
Reported.
---
Makes me wonder if one way of designing the choice and consequence story, companions, and stuff is that they make Wastelander expansion into another new mode and it will be single player (or team limited instance co op) story.
---
Nice!!! Pure luck!!
---
3 kills for me. You have to spawn to your team.
---
After the patch is live
---
Spent $35, no regrets.
---
Yes but you dont have to team right?
---
Jesus, man we're just curious cause we want to play the fucking game
---
Yeah I think some of the criticisms were warranted. I feel as though more of the scrutiny was at the state of the game at release, not its current state.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve only watched a bit and I‚Äôve got to say, it is definitely pretty cool haha.
---
I have't used any mods so that is strange. Is there a way to like get back to the original game files only quickly?
---
Obviously when I‚Äôm server hopping to find a West Tec that hasn‚Äôt already been cleared out I want more players on a server....
---
Or a synth. Theoretically.
---
I dont think that implies what you are reading. It sounds to me like there will be a total of 73 perks available in NW, with some of them being new for and exclusive to the game mode. To me, that means that some of those 73 were lifted from the base game, while others are going to be unique to Nuclear Winter. It does not mean NW specific perks will be available in the other modes.
---
It‚Äôs pretty fun. Lot of luck involved for loot
---
Holy fuck. So damn frustrating.
---
Purely cosmetic
---
My minds telling me nooooooo.... But my body.... MY BODIES TELLING ME YEAAAHHHH
---
Honestly I have no idea how console players put up with the stupid bad design of inventory management and perk loadouts/switching...  when Bethesda broke the loadout manager in a patch, I basically almost didn't play the game until the mod was updated.
---
Fortnout?
---
Any updates?
---
~~I have. And the servers are back up and update live - and It's still asking me to pay for it.~~ Figured it out!
---
Happens all the time. Check at a vending machine
---
~~It's still asking me to pay for it.~~ Figured it out! Thanks!
---
It hasn‚Äôt worked yet for me anyway, so your hard work may not be in vain.
---
Ah, it's probs how much you get for not killing much and sneaking through, no doubt you get way more when you start killing elites &amp; co.
---
Oh man I am so excited to hear this! Can you tell us more about what happened //i'm a poor pleb at work and I guarantee you my download didn't start automatically
---
Or a synth.  Theoretically.
---
Mines 12mb and its fine.... Always has been.
---
It's just a visual bug in the PipBoy.
---
I'd have to say yes. but not betting my life of it.. that's reserved for the virtual characters :P
---
But don't you need repair kits, which are only sold on the atom store?
---
I use a Guerrilla VATS build. But not because I like it, but because it's so easy you don't even have to think. Just camp with chameleon and wait for someone to run around. That's not PvP to me, but hide and seek.
---
VATS builds would still work against creatures, just like it does in Nuclear Winter, of course.
---
I agree that the solution would be to eliminate legendaries.
---
Careful now, don‚Äôt run around with all that edge. You might cut yourself.
---
A Fox is fair game but a cat crosses the line
---
It's so true, I always wanted elder maxons coat in fallout 4 but I didn't want to side with anyone but the brotherhood in my first playthrough
---
&gt;Nah you're the crybaby 
---
Yeah.. that right there. Fucking baby. 
---
Glad you have no life and enjoy wasting your own time. Everything you just accused me of... go look in the mirror. Fucking baby
---
The first match I played, I got stuck trying to revive my teammate. We both couldn't move, and ended up burning to death.
---
You don‚Äôt have to, but you can‚Äôt kill them. And everyone else is running on teams. Got killed multiple time by a team of 4.
---
Nice I plan on greeting players also.
---
Holy shit yes, I might actually play this now!
---
It's a visual bug! Happened both ways with my scrip. I was like "Whoa! I have 240 scrip??" //runs to the Purveyor who kicked my scrip broke ass to the curb!
---
It's very original and has a lot of 'Kool' appeal..
---
Thank you, very much.
---
What‚Äôs the link to your Discord?   I‚Äôve never played but will be buying the game soon.
---
Same here, won on my first go having never tried a Battle Royale before! Really fun!
---
Reminds me of Bartleby from True : Rainbow Kingdom (etc) on Netflix.
---
Custom INIs, BA2s, dxgi, additional files in directory like loadout manager perk config file?
---
Still not free in Microsoft store? Am I doing something wrong?
---
Hapened to me too and we had such a good random team, shame.
---
I'm surprisingly enjoying it and I'm NOT a PVP type person; but I enjoy the suspense it produces.
---
Get bloody mess if possible. Often times the issue is that the body did different ragdoll on your end than the game expected, so it's there just not where you think it should be.
---
I genuinely hope that was sarcasm. I had to deal with quite a few unintelligent people on reddit yesterday.... and specifically on the fallout 76 reddit. It's a no from me.
---
Oh man are new players that bad now? I am a level 5 or 6 since I haven't logged too many hours in and haven't got to touch the new content, but God that sounds annoying I prefer to travel by myself and find what I need.
---
10$= 1500 atoms (500 bonus instead of 100), repair kits and Elder Maxons coat. Its well worth it for a E3 promo.
---
Jesus man lol
---
yeah thought it might just be me after not seeing another post.
---
You‚Äôre obviously not that passionate, considering  Bethesda communicated about how this FO game was going to differ from the norm. And how they were trying many ideas they‚Äôve generated in previous game developments, but could never implemented in the single player model.
---
Your ‚Äúvoiced displeasure‚Äù is sad. Once again, you succeeded a grand total of fuck all, with your uniformed argument, backed with non-existent points. And yet, you still had the balls to attack the community after your 5 iq write up. Your actions painted a mental picture of you dwelling in your basement, crying to your mum about how video games aren‚Äôt tailored specifically for you, like everything should be, right?  :-/
---
Keep up the active complaints fam, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre getting more enjoyment than everybody who isn‚Äôt strictly being toxic about absolutely everything, and actually playing and enjoying video games... oh wait...
---
Man, what a negative Nancy that guy is.
---
Oh a few years now I think.
---
Well first thing you have to do is wait for the trial to become available
---
bethesda launcher is up
---
Yes , first thing broken
---
With the satellite the brotherhood used
---
Just follow the questlines you get fresh out of the Vault. Stick to lower level areas (Forest, Toxic Valley, Ash Heap once you're a little leveled up, basically the upper left of the map) but don't be afraid to venture out, too. 
---
A lot of high level, day one players like myself will be on the lookout for newbies, so don't be afraid to accept random team invites. Yeah some will be griefers but the majority just want to give you some aid and stuff to get you through the week. We're pretty much a helpful bunch.  
---
On that note, if a high level comes running up to you, they probably don't want to kill you and are trying to give you stuff. If they do shoot, just don't shoot back. Fatal mistake (no pun).
---
Other than that... Wander. You have nothing to lose but junk when you die so might as well get out there and explore.
---
I hope not. It's been nice not having to hear the same ten voice lines over and over again. If they do I hope they at least have two separate stations, one with and one without.
---
So first thing you want to do is wait for the actual trial to become available.
---
You start with random or default 7 (tbd) then by playing the mode you can unlock more that you can use
---
He's refreshing on new trashing anyone asking
---
But everyone is hyped for BR...????
---
It's a blast!
---
Whooosh
---
See if you‚Äôve played with the changes and they‚Äôre better I‚Äôm all here for it man, I just thought you were shooting my concerns down with no basis. I‚Äôm excited for the changes, they look good.
---
Well, smaller area, no carry weight coming from other server, no stashes. I can see it lol
---
Wheres my slavery from nukaworld
---
Bye!
---
I tried it back in December and couldn't get into it. I just picked it back up and now all I wanna do is go home and play it
---
It is just a new mode but lots of new free items. I‚Äôm happy with it!
---
write a macro to change the name of the custom.ini file and assign it a custom key - -  works fine that way for me
---
agreed i have mine maxed out and its still a bit clunky
---
Is it not available? I thought it started on the 10th. It's the 10th.
---
just in BR mode you mean? or in adventure too?
---
You're the fucking baby here you dumb sack of shit, WAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH! Mean old Jim is actually *gasp*, actually daring to criticize Bethesda for their bullshit business practices ! OMG the horror!  God you are so fucking pathetic I almost feel sorry for you, you sound like some pathetic overweight basement dwelling little-dick virgin fucking loser.
---
You need to look in the fucking mirror, you are one of the dumbest motherfuckers on the planet, Bethesda does not care how much you lick their asshole, they will never be your friend, but of course your FAR too stupid to realize that.
---
Pathetic fucking cry baby cunt.
---
I'm more worried about all the TSE legendaries honestly, their the reason survival will never be balanced
---
I did, but nothing has been done about it.  It seems to be live now though.  If you go to the shop it shows the 500 extra and the coat.  It didn't earlier when I purchased it.
---
I swear I chose a bad username for my personality lol
---
Wait you can have teammates???? I thought is was a solo type thing?
---
Lol what a piece of work. Why are you even here?
---
So at work for a couple more hours, I‚Äôve heard you join in without gear/meds/food. So no-ones ridiculously op with tse waepons?
---
I didn't have to. I only had to pull the dll for SFE and my Fallout76Custom.ini files out and put them in a folder on the desktop so they wouldn't load and it let me in.
---
The error would suggest otherwise. I could be wrong but to me that indicates you either have or had a mod at some point. Either that or your game maybe didn't update properly? I suppose if it keeps failing and you're sure no mods ever, could try doing a clean install maybe? 
---
To be clear, by mod i don't mean you yourself have an aim bot or cheat in any way. BR will prevent any mod, regardless if it's deemed acceptable game play or not.
---
Your beyond help.
---
I would like to add this in, if it makes you feel any better my friend. I grew up in the gaming boom-esc generation. I am 25 now, so when I was 10, the game to play was Halo 1, 2, and 3 and the COD's, I used to be able to completely wreck most people in those games, and I was ehhh, ok at PUBG when it first came out. But as the years have gone by, I am definitely not as good as I used to be :( Games are still fun, but the reflexes kind of went down the toilet. Let these little kids have their moment, and just try to have fun :)
---
Most interesting text on this subreddit. Bsda is listening to the community and it's been my impression all from the start of FO76.
---
Same here!
---
I did the same thing played up level 22 when it launched and decided to give it another go when my buddy picked up the game I was surprised to find my self having fun with it again
---
The event: Encryptid is good for that. There is always about 50 downed players, only issue is to get them first before other players revive them.
---
&gt; I will fucking kill myself.
---
That's quite an escalation
---
up is down..
---
some people like it like that
---
Where do you get the deep pocketed plan?
---
It's about how you visualize the controls, and it's more relevant in some games than others.  There are some decent visualizations [here](https://www.quora.com/Why-do-some-people-use-inverted-controls-in-3D-video-games-What-are-the-percentages-of-people-who-play-inverted-vs-non-inverted).
---
It depends on the kills first game i got 475 and 24 caps
---
Edit: i think it depends on kills or how long you survive
---
I really didnt expect it to be as stable as it is.
---
Only a bit of fps lag on PC, but the same fps lag hits in adventure mode around the same areas in the forest
---
thanks for the update
---
From what I understand it's also on Spotify if that helps. I don't have an Android so I've literally no idea how you guys get music on your phone.
---
Were you able to find any melee weapons easily? Like a meat hook or something of the like? I can't aim to save my life D:
---
It‚Äôs an entirely separate game mode. Chill out.
---
Why don't you just play it and find out instead of speculating?
---
I've played three matches and died within the first two minutes in all of them. I love BR but I'm terrible at it. :) Good times!
---
Ooh this is a good idea. But does it have to be a teammate? Or just anyone?
---
*Preston Garvey idolizes you*
---
1. No, you don't.  you can repair with scrap (depending on what you're repairing, it varies, mostly wood and steel scrap, but sometimes leather, rubber, screws, etc.).
---
2. Repair kits can also be used, but they can be bought from the store OR gotten as drops from higher level mobs (mostly end-game ones).  But you absolutely don't need to use kits to repair - but if you don't have one, you can only repair at the appropriate bench (weapons bench for weapons, armor bench for armor).
---
There are perk cards that let you 'over repair' things, so that it the get extra durability (up to 200%), otherwise you repair them only to 100%.  Purchased repair kits also repair to 100%, and the ones that drop from enemies repair to 150%.
---
The beta beta
---
I used to be a pilot, so inverted y axis feels correct to me. When it's not inverted it just feels extremely wrong.
---
Auto weapons are the only way to go
---
I hate BR games too but all I see is glowing reviews for the update. I'm eager to try it out with my posse.
---
Yall really dont have Charisma? That was one of the first SPECIALS i put points into for teamplay. They do have a respec its just one point at a time so it takes a while.
---
It doesn't seem like all of this stuff is Atom Shop items. Some look like Nuclear Winter rewards.
---
everyone is equal...you find it, and use it.
---
Takes way too long to go from 1 game to another, that alone is making me lose intrest.
---
And I just blue screened.
---
Np
---
Yeah. That makes no sense.
---
Noobie here, what does nukashine do?
---
I have a foundation and a ladder coming off of it, and now i cant scrap either, as it says for BOTH items" cannot delete as the another object is dependant on it" or whatever it says
---
but, there is only the 2 pieces! and they BOTH give the same message, I can scrap or move them either...
---
I think I like it more because the matches are so short and you get gear super easily. Not running around naked for an hour
---
If BR isn‚Äôt your thing and you get bored, take a break and come back in fall for what is essentially season two of fallout adventure mode.
---
Imagine being mad that you have to walk up to someone a press a button
---
Todd: *Inhales*
---
WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRGGGGHHHH
---
Not everyone cares about rebuilding. The world is gone. Kill other people for their stuff if you want.
---
I got in the habit due to playing a LOT of flying/space games. "Push up for nose down" a la flight stick controls.
---
Oh nice, thanks for letting me know that. I definitely don't wanna spend my atoms.
---
Literally anyone.
---
this is the first Im hearing of it..
---
I'm also really enjoying it. I've been totally on the fence until now but it's actually quite a laugh.
---
Because I didn't see the second menu to modify. It wasn't there before the camera.
---
Yeah the pilot comparison makes sense to me.
---
Get mental help.
---
&gt;I will fucking kill myself.
---
Yeah that's what you're supposed to do didn't you read the objective
---
Is the fast "fort" building a thing in Nuclear Winter? That was the worst part for me. My fingers were never coordinated enough to get a structure up before getting murdered.
---
you said no vault starting with number 7.. except vault 76
---
Im away from home until the 29th so will miss the entire thing until it gets officially released
---
&gt;Bethesda is the leader in gaming innovation
---
In that same conference...
---
&gt;We‚Äôre introducing this amazing new feature called ‚ÄúNPCs‚Äù
---
"New Perk Cards"
---
And here I was thinking my collector's edition strat guide was outdated before. Now it's really really outdated. Lol. -cries in corner-
---
That's pretty neat. I really can't wait to jump in - hopefully my download will be done tonight D:
---
Seems like two shot is doubling damage? Do you have any non two shot explosives that went up?
---
He needs to become a radio host.
---
To my surprise, it's not even laggy on xbox.
---
Makes you blackout afterwards
---
When I look at this with really low brightness, the only part I can see is a cat
---
I bout my key from a 3rd party (G2A) and the key was suspended,  and got a refund within 24 hours of me bringing it to there attention it took Bethesda almost 2 weeks to communicate to me that this was the issue
---
Please also acknowledge any double-triple detonations on the same location.
---
"Really?!? ... Another detonation on the same place?  Someone's ex-wife must live there."
---
"Really?!? ... A third detonation on the same place?  Someone's mother-in-law must live there.  But not anymore!"
---
Any word on the elder jacket? Can't check myself for about an hour
---
Patch barely came out a couple hours ago and someone already complaining about being killed.
---
If you own it already just play it and see for yourself instead of relying on other peoples opinions.
---
I accidentally dropped my All-Rise looting Sasquatch impostor. Not really a huge deal but I was pretty fond of it.
---
In 4-5 hours it will be 11th in Europe. Just when I had a day off work =/. 2 shifts tomorrow, bad luck. Post update guys if you manage to find it. I'll keep on checking every now and then too. Usually, those things just pop in the search.
---
Yea what‚Äôs up w that?? Are we gonna miss the first day of only 7? :(
---
And you can play the new game mode solo.
---
Remember solo doesn't mean your alone, solo just means your not in a party.
---
Marquee arrows have been out since the start. They are listed under lights. You can also purchase them from other vendors like Grahm etc.
---
Well, that kind of sounds like you're saying:
---
"I love my car, but now that the manufacturer has a made a truck, I might just stop driving altogether".
---
Dude... just keep driving your car.
---
i agree. i was a whiny pos about it before launch but i enjoy it.
---
That would be because the trial isnt available on xbox yet. Which makes sense considering no one has the trial on xbox yet
---
Haha, right.. way less than adventure
---
Yeah, pretty much. :/
---
I think its like 129
---
I always wondered how to spell that.
---
&gt; So.. you don't want the Vats Crit +50% to work on my lever action rifle, does that also mean you're willing to give up the Bloodied Effect on your weapons?
---
bingo
---
But in Nuclear Winter, it sounds like you have to find EVERYTHING you use, every time you play... so maybe they have fixed this issue by making that kind of loot unavailable.
---
you CAN play 100% solo.  They didnt say you will be able to complete all main, side quests, and events solo.  Sounds like you're more suited for an offline single-player game. There are a few thousand.  Pick one.
---
I hope you're right! :)  
---
I'm curious about the new prestige option.
---
Why play Fortnite for free when you can pay for a downgraded version?
---
Just do the encrypted event, there‚Äôs a big puddle in front of the shed and people need reviving quite a bit with that event if you don‚Äôt want to ask anyone to help. Someone came across me picking bloodleaf and snaptail reed from the river and messaged me on console to say can I revive you so I jumped in front of an enemy, they revived, I went my way they went theirs, job done, there was no need to team up or interact any further.
---
It's just a glitch from changing characters I believe. Theres a couple of them including one that puts a handlebar mustache on all of my toons including my female mule. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Go to either the purveyor or the pioneer camp vending machine.  Usually just going into the menu of one of these two and back out fixes them in your pip boy screen.
---
Got it thanks
---
I could get mine just under 400 before adrenaline, sneak, crits, stuff like that. But I don't have one anymore. Prefer not to use explosive weapons.
---
total drama queen
---
Yeah like i said, i could be completely wrong. Just tossing out my 2 cents.
---
I'm hoping someone else here might chime in and give some input. 
---
I suppose alternatively you can make your own post asking the masses for help?
---
Or even open a case with bugthesda support?
---
Either way I wish you luck and hope it works when you try again. Oh and happy anniversary!
---
Dude where im at its almost the  11th stop defending stupid shit like this
---
all my Melee weapons have massively been reduced. PVE and it seems all weapons got a massive rebalance.
---
Wanna know how I know you didn't read the patch notes?
---
&gt; Simple solution is just stop telling the public what is coming... Like really that will work .. ya I know...
---
Lol, I agree. Unless they really start messing up on implementing content, it should have remained private. I'd rather them have the ability to pivot and introduce something new that isn't on the roadmap if it's some totally awesome feature, but now that the roadmap has been made public we're sort of locked into it. Not only that, but now the loom of published deadlines are constantly looming over the devs and they have no leeway unlike if the roadmap had stayed internal. I don't mind waiting an extra week if it means the content is a bit more polished and the people who made it aren't being driven to death to make a deadline.
---
I said this to my friend earlier. It is really shocking how little issues (meaning zero in about 6 matches) I have run into. It's really a good execution of the BR style merging with the FO76 gameplay I love. I don't know if the hype will last. But I'm having a great time with it. Though in my opinion the queue timer resetting when you lose players before the match actually starts probably shouldn't happen but thats about it.
---
No it would be like changing the engine in the car i already like. I like my car just needs a tune up not a new engine
---
Well you can play it free for a week!
---
Interesting read for later thanks
---
What weapon did you swith to then
---
Just remember, you‚Äôre nobody till somebody loves you, and I‚Äôm that somebody, I love you
---
There is an option to queue with teammates when you select the game mode.
---
Do you have neon lights and/or billboards? (Nuka Quantum sign, Old Possom bar sign, Pick Axe Pilsner, etc.)? If so, those were just increased in budgetary size, so you are likely well OVER the budget and will not see any savings from deleting smaller items as a result. You can try removing those items that were given an increased budgetary footprint, but that means you will probably not be able to add them back.
---
Hi that somebody, i love you, I'm dad.
---
You will never be required to spend atoms to play (unless you *just can't live* without that spiffy new power armor paint...)  Honestly, that would be pretty shitty and I'd be investing in pitchfork and torch futures if that was the case.  The community would never stand for something like that.
---
Maybe instead of going to YouTube and other media you could jump back into the game and give it another 20hrs(or less, up to you) and see for yourself where the game is.
---
I am not saying you will like it any more than you did previously. People have different tastes. 
---
You will hopefully see that the game is in a much better place. The servers are much more reliable. Bugs and glitches do still exist but as far as I am aware only minor ones, nothing game breaking. The separate PVP servers have all but wiped out griefers for those who just enjoy adventure. The addition of actual player vending machines has brought the map to life. Making meeting players a whole lot easier.
---
I was furious with bethesda at the mess they released but because of my love for FO games I stuck it out. The road was bumpy (to say the least), but I truly believe the game is now in a good place and improving with each update. I also believe the bethesda realised what a huge mistake they made releasing this game too early and are now doing their best to rectify it by listening to their fanbase and for the most part trying to give us what we want.
---
Anyway I hope you decide to give it a 2nd chance and that the game as it is now pleasantly surprises you.
---
I believe it‚Äôs under ‚Äúadd-ons‚Äù as ‚Äúdemo.‚Äù I could be wrong though.
---
FYI, they said in the patch notes that you'll have to remove mods and custom files before you can play the new mode. Sounds like you'll have to go back to vanilla for the time being.
---
Thanks for your reports! The recent V.A.T.S. change to close immediately after a kill was not intended to affect Gun Fu. We're looking into this and are currently planning to fix it with our next update.
---
Is this across all modes or just NW?
---
10 minutes nah
---
You don't have to do the swimmer challenge.. you can do literally any of the others that don't require interaction.
---
This is a list of links to comments made by Bethesda employees in this thread:

I play solo and I just went to the encrypted event, even if you have to buy a card and start it yourself. Plenty of people dying there for you to help. So yes you can play the game solo so stop with your bullshit.
---
I‚Äôm messing with you, good job that win! First day!
---
I generally don't care for PvP at all, let alone BR. I played two matches of NW and had a blast!
---
*you‚Äôre proving my point :)
---
It's 2:29 PM for maryland and 1:29PM for houston. It should be up regardless...
---
I just use the default settings. I fear I might be missing out on a more enhanced gaming experience by not adjusting those settings. Lol. I‚Äôm on PlayStation btw.
---
I Call bullshit, can‚Äôt get to just below 400 with a TSE handmade. Before the nerf, sure
---
Ok
---
Play and find out to be sure
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwcgm-g4Bac
---
Yeah, I had already disabled BetterInventory (only mod) and renamed my fallout custom ini before launching. I'm seeing a couple other threads where people are having all their prefs reset and even having perk cards assigned over their actual attribute level and being perma stuck in over encumbered. D:
---
hadn't put on power armor yet. good heads up
---
I see where this is going :3 and let me tell you, I already went there, and I am still suffering from laser burn :D
---
I'm new waiting for the free trial to begin so this is all news to me, but thank you for the heads up.
---
And by the looks of it, the game is only getting better. Still yet to play the BR but it's just another mode that doesn't take away from the rest of the game.
---
I really want her to get upgraded.  So I can kill her ass in a boss fight.  Maybe finally loot shielded plan for Raider underoos.
---
I would love this so much! Come on Bethesda - it was good with Mad Dog and Travis, lets have a new dude for our region! :D
---
There is certainly more to do, and its become a more stable and player friendly experience, but its still lacking in any meaningful end game content. If you want to experience the base game, and some recent additions, in their best possible form thus far - sure. If you are going to grind through the base game to get to end game you will find yourself underwhelmed. Depends on what you want out of the game.
---
My camo is in the cranberry bog sadly.
---
Are you able to queque up with people you know? Or only randoms?
---
Wow you found a nuke case already?
---
Ok I'll sit back down.
---
Same problem but xbox
---
Awesome thank you! I am so ready to hop in!
---
I ment like is it live now? There was a whole fiasco about it not being live yet last night
---
Just like any other br.
---
So wrong.. But feels so good!
---
Yeah they've been around - it was one of the first plans I bought when I started lol
---
Thanks for the quick response! I look forward to the fix.
---
One would guess to test it and see how people like it hmm ü§î
---
Wait " **Wall D√©cor:** Stitched up a few holes that were visible on the Mounted Scorchbeast Queen Head. " we can get that in the game?!
---
You do realize the contradiction here, right?    
---
"Yeah man, I haven't played the game since launch, but I know it's bad because of websites and youtube."   
---
&lt;five seconds later&gt;   
---
"I have no idea if the game is a mess because nobody covers it anymore."   
---
Just stop. You're calling him a fanboi, but it's obviously you who is the one exhibiting that type of cognitive dissonance.
---
Thanks bro. Turns out only took 499 times of clicking X on my ps4 but it eventually gave up and let me in after all that knockin
---
*Worth it*.
---
Haha I just imagined like shooting BRIGHT BLINKING arrows at people
---
Adjusting sensitivity - be able to do a double take so fast it could snap your real live neck.
---
Inverted - Idk... but I prefer it. I'm able to play both and it really just depends on the game which one I use. First person shooters are easier for me inverted, while free roam third person I prefer non-inverten. I'm weird, I know.
---
Theres 10 million posts every hour, people can easily use the search function but theyre lazy
---
People don't like it if they want to know
---
Well if its still downloadable on the 10th then they have done exactly what they said they would do which is make it free. 
---
Whats frustrating is when people get given a free trial then get annoyed and feel entitled that thier internet connections should be taken into conaideration. You will still have 6 days.
---
Been out since last night.
---
https://imgur.com/a/MMhVdqY

You can mostly thank Sony that you cant. They're stickers with cross platform. Xbox, PC, Nintendo are opening up a lot and putting pressure on them. Should be mainstream feature eventually. Especially if you buy a game twice, you know?
---
Just found out the culprit, the mothman neon stand sign from atomic shop takes up a bunch of budget for no reason
---
Hi Z0MG\_H4X,
---
I have tried big picture mode and desktop mode, both with no luck. I also have in-game overlay turned on. I also just tried uninstalling/reinstallling the game with no luck either.
---
Thanks,
---
Justin Smith
---
Hey no worries man I'm sure it'll be fine after a clean reinstall, something fucky with the update. fingers crossed :)
---
Many thanks, enjoy the update!
---
They still haven't fixed bunker buster lol.
---
Yes you need to invite them to team via the social tab on the main menu
---
It applies to launchers only. Explosive rifles etc did not get buffed
---
If you're not having issues aiming where you want to, it's probably fine as it is
---
LMAO that's not even going to get you to level 50.
---
Call BS all you want. My bloodied handmade as it stands does 301. I know my TSE handmade was doing more than that. My TSE lever was doing over 500 per shot.
---
Wow, yeah...my brain went a totally different way
---
Why don't you play it and decide for yourself?
---
FOV is adjustable to 120, I think? I play on 100.
---
FPS; my build is overkill for this game, but it does not sustain 120fps+ 99% of the time in 1440p and maxed out. (9700K, RTX 2080 Ti, 32gb ram) I actually get drops down to the 30s on the whitesprings golf lawn -- which leads to bad optimization in that area because the same thing happens on a GTX 1660.
---
More often than not though, I'm generally well above the standard 60fps minus the aforementioned golf course. I honestly don't pay much attention to FPS unless it is noticeably stuttering.
---
Where the trial currently is.
---
Some, absolutely... a lot, possibly... all of it, not really.
---
Please get a mic if you play any multiplayer game that requires teamwork, and yes that means adventure mode too (if you play coop)
---
nope just recently started playing again and was enjoying it then i logged in one day and this was happening
---
The mode is actually real fun.
---
i never played hardcore mode on those games.. but now i feel like cheating lol i got used to stay feed and drink and search for those, in f4 i was like lol this is food... what's for?. same for vats... "oh wait mr. raider" i must scroll my entire inventory and decide what would be better to use in this battle. also why my weapon never broke?
---
It's free for a week.. try it!
---
Hi, if you're still receiving this error message can you please try completely closing Fallout 76 and the Bethesda.net launcher, and then relaunch them both and try again? This may help to resolve the issue.
---
The free trial? I couldn't find it in the store and the game page only showed to purchase still
---
Invert x axis too?
---
Totally, especially when you can't see what is doing it. I love the mystery, it's exhilarating  :P
---
Not everybody wants to talk to you get over it

Yeah, r/fo76filthycasuals is a much less toxic place. I recommend hanging out there.

Its in the patch notes, but its not written clearly. What they call "consistency" actually meant that a great number of them had their budget space increased.
---
For real, how hard is it to get an answer? Christ.
---
Hell yes have an updoot.
---
Yeah, same goes for survivalist mode
---
EDITABLE BILLBOARD??!?!  Holy smokes my penis can only get so erect. How can you edit?  Manual paint?  Drawing? Or just by sticking wall decorations and letter signs on it?
---
No one is going to see you in your camo there :P
---
Yeah I gotta say I agree with the majority here, I think it‚Äôs fine if they roll out new content. Regardless of the state of the game. Which is actually the best it‚Äôs been in a while. You just want something to bitch about!
---
Todd said the game community was friendly. This is Reddit
---
Yes you are. Is this really your idead of a good time, insulting someone who will never be able to play a proper sequal to a game they love?
---
Look, here's my $0.02. Worth exactly what you paid me for it.
---
1) It's the shit-hot game mode right now. As a business? it makes sense.
---
2)  A franchise needs to attract new players to stay "alive". 
---
3) Maybe it'll "clean up" adventure and survival by giving a certain group of players somewhere to scratch the itch that current modes don't scratch... leaving the current modes to "find their groove".
---
It looks like pikachu
---
okay preston garvey, who let you in here?
---
ah dang.
---
What is with you people here, you're like the 3rd person here that keeps changing the goal posts in these conversations or changing the topic randomly. You'd think after months of people trashing the game you'd get better at defending it.
---
You said I had 0 first hand experience, I responded that I played for almost 20 hours. 
---
Now you are saying that doesn't even get me to 50 as if that negates my 20 hours of experience. 20 hours is more than any game deserves to give you a feel for it or catch your interest.
---
Is there somewhere I can connect with other players without spamming in the subreddit proper? I need to revive and be revived to get the backpack in about a week or so.
---
Im very skeptical, but since its free im going to give it a shot. Who knows maybe i'll love it, maybe not. 
---
Im hoping its at least somewhat polished, I know it was very buggy in the past.
---
So its still the 10th and not the 11th? So everything is how it should be then. Like when they recently said it will be live on the 10th at a undisclosed time.
---
I like how you assume they absoloutly owe you this FREE trial at a time thats most convieniant to yourself lmao.
---
Okie dokie
---
Gotcha. Besides I rely mostly on vats anyway when not using a scope.
---
Talking about the DLC vaults besides them, he was wondering if vault 79 was the one in the ash heap but that‚Äôs 63
---
Everything
---
Chat volume is off by default for me on PS4. If I don't manually go in each &amp; every time I play and turn the volume up, I can't hear anyone.
---
It's free for a week.. try it! Some updates/additions were much better than others, but I have a feeling that the new DLC coming later on, will be great
---
Unless something immediately killed and ate him. Then we'd never know. And after being trapped in the dev room for God knows how long, his survival skills probably atrophied and made him easy game for a deathclaw or something. Chances are, if he got out, he's one of those stripped, bloody skeletons.
---
I am planning to run and give little gift sets to newbies :D I got plans, upgraded baseball bats, clothes etc all ready! Been trying to collect canned meat stew to give them that extra boost.
---
I'm pretty happy with it. I went in solo and placed 7th and made it to the second to last ring. When I saw the starting map I knew I would. Everyone else spawned in a marked location. I chose the most desolate spot where I knew there was still some buildings and there was some crates placed there with guns and stuff and nobody was anywhere near me. I almost got eaten by the storm though in the first sweep. That thing moves FAST.
---
You have to hit the button to "Buy Atoms" in the store window. It's one of the options there.
---
happens the same on pc
---
Yep. Seeing the same over here, still. Guessing the maintenance is either going long or Beth is staggering the pipelines. Oh, well. We will get it soon enough.
---
Agreed - everything else seems to have been forgotten with all the battle royale news, but I‚Äôm more so interested in the other changes coming before Wastelanders.  Hoping that everything else didn‚Äôt get pushed to the fall though.  A summer roadmap would be very helpful
---
They would have to time out the dialogue between songs for each option to be the same since the radios are all synced.
---
Dont think they would have abandoned it anyway. They are probably gathering and polishing their multiplayer capabilities which they can include in later games.
---
I‚Äôm half-assing my job rn and browsing reddit at stoplights so I can get home as fast as possible
---
I'd have recommended it before E3 and now definitely do. There's tons of posts like this all the time - the answer is always the same. Get back to Appalachia.
---
Fair point.  I guess I am speaking not really to the ‚Äúhey this bag is not right‚Äù part and more to the presumptuous, ‚Äúbecause of avarice, or lack of care, etc...‚Äù part.  These people have delivered awesome games for many years by and large, and ones that inspired other parts of gaming industry.  I think critique is fair always.  I just did not see a lot of constructive critique.
---
You know, because it's made by a good company that still appreciates gaming, releases when it's finished, and doesn't exploit players with false advertising and overpriced microtransactions. But sure, it's a circle jerk. Notthing like this reddit, no.
---
I've been seeing a lot of good feedback from other players with performance compared to launch.. then again, there are still others having major issues like crashes. It really depends on the person's rig
---
My tse handmade is in the 360's with adrenal and rifleman perks
---
In fallout new Vegas he was a pre war AI, so it‚Äôs quite possible that the radio station is already active
---
Had to ask. It usually the first thing people forget when an update is performed.
---
Go to the atomic shop (might have to be in a nuclear winter lobby already) and mark something as a NW favorite
---
Oh I don't think I tried that! Thank you very much! This chicken breast is amazing üòã
---
This is just a similar art piece detailing the game mode not a future roadmap
---
Nope, I'm just doing his job for him. Someone else actually did give  a nicely written and compelling argument. The other 10 people attacking me are all just rabid fanboys. But I knew that's what I would get posting a comment like I did on r/fo76
---
Oh cool, now you can't be killed even if afk, I didn't know.
---
to argue with people.
---
Unarmed is quite viable, especially if you are Bloodied.  But you're right that Scorchbeasts are a bit of a problem.  Fortunately, because Unarmed only has 1 damage perk (Iron Fist), you'll probably have space in your Strength tree for a rank of each Heavy Gunner perk.  I carry around a Gatling gun for dealing with the Scorchbeasts and can usually take them down before they decide to land.
---
Go to atomic shop and press enter or whatever button to enable already owned apparel
---
Yup
---
Hey, I can bet you weren't the only one.
---
to be fair i wouldn't mind like 1 settler/companion, but I don't wanna have to feed them, i want them to be independent, not just an annoying thing to take care of
---
go into atomic shop, go to something you own and press enter on it.  it says equip for nuclear winter
---
Not really at all.
---
From the patch notes:
---
&gt; You can now select cosmetic items that you‚Äôve unlocked in the Atomic Shop as favorites.  
---
&gt; When you favorite paints for items like weapons and Power Armor that can be found in Nuclear Winter, they will be automatically applied when you pick those items up during a match.  
---
&gt; Conquer your opponents in style by favoriting cosmetic items like outfits and headwear.
---
Got more than I bargained for, looks like my LUCK is maxed üòé
---
I think that hating on Fallout 76 has become basically a cult. There's dogma that the game is terrible and crashes every 30 minutes. Nothing can go against the belief because "everybody knows Fo76 is bad". It's maddening how people can claim that the game is still shit while saying the they have not played since launch (or never). And how do they know the game is still bad? Because some mr. Angry Youtuber said so... We haven't come far since the times of Galileo Galilei...
---
I bought mine at a vendor before they moved all the factions to White Spring.
---
I saw that BR focused image and it's great for that one sole feature but it makes no mention of the vault raids and other stuff coming with the rest of this DLC season.
---
https://i.imgur.com/luaXcqA.png -  just as the "Wild Appalachia" DLC was more than just survival mode or any other single feature.
---
You have to favourite the item in the atomic shop itself.
---
Trust me, I've wondered the same thing üòÇü§£
---
Could you actually get the coat? I've got the atoms and repair kits, but the coat is nowhere to be found.
---
It was there for me as soon as the servers went back up. Try going through the atoms store or try the website on another device might come up. What region are you?
---
A ping system would be great!
---
I know that most solo queue games are probably going to be rough, but I just got my first win, and it was with randoms. And there were only 3 of us. Hang in there!
---
Having lots of fun so far.
---
Oh shit, Elder Maxson coat! Looks ill finally have Something to spend thise atoms on.
---
Ik and I love it! Don't have to win üò™
---
Weapons like the DeathclawGuantlet and powerfist only work outside of power armor and take a little more building around. That being said I run them do just fine with a furious 1* handmade rifle to take down airborn things. Going with a shotgun is also very viable just depends on your style. If your on ps4 i can set you up with a few things.
---
Okay so FYI do a hard reset and it will show up!
---
Oh, these new controls.... they‚Äôll take getting used to...
---
Is editing the ini still allowed to remove the depth of field and change the fov? Or will it get you banned?
---
You have to craft it at the armor workbench for 3 cloth
---
No I'm just old and It was supposed to be a reply to someone and I posted it wrong. Sorry.
---
So then it's not a 7 day trial. 
---
I understand it's free but people are allowed to be excited and people are allowed to be disappointed.
---
Like the cultist gas mask, may pick that up.
---
There are two types of fallout players:  those that can tell each style of PA by looking at it, and those that just think of it as blanket ‚Äúpower armor‚Äù
---
I don‚Äôt really like it, something about it just doesn‚Äôt flow well for me also there‚Äôs way too much waiting between selecting the mode and actually loading in. That needs to be sorted majorly fast.
---
Well said (but I'm biased of course).  
---
Don't ignore the bugs, the issues, report them!  
---
But at the same time, don't let the issues define and control the whole experience!  
---
Is it frustrating as hell you can't properly upgrade all of the robot armor,'or down grade the materials on all the leg armor, combat to trapper... 
---
Hell yes, but it also does impact the game enough, even collectively, to invalidate the sum.  
---
Keep talking about what could be improved and submit suggestions to Bethesda in a well (or atleast intelligible) format and it benefits us all, from the Players to Bethesda at large.
---
And I'd say I'm more cautiously optimistic, overwhelmingly so, but I've been burned enough to not have an exit strategy... ;)
---
Same omg. I have like 4 hours left here and I'm dying. My friend last night was like "you're gonna call in tomorrow aren't you" But I was a Big Kid and came in today and it's really been the longest day of just.. reading reddit lol
---
Nah.
---
&gt;but I know it's bad because of websites and youtube
---
Never said that, as I explained to that dude way down the comment chain.
---
I mean look at his post history.... obviously he does.
---
Servers are up; might need to back out of the game completely on console or close and open up bethesda.net on PC.
---
Yeah - I dont normally like BR games but this seems like a fun. I think if you are a PvE person mainly then you should at least try it, its zero risk PvP basically.
---
So wait im confused, downloading the free trial right now, is this just battle royale? Orrr?
---
Im on ps4
---
yea had to restart xbox for it to show up for me as well.
---
So we're just ignoring that they lied to us multiple times, falsely advertised the game, the canvas bag, the rum and never planned on doing anything about them until lawsuits hit. And released the game early completely broken with bugs dating back a decade or more ignoring even modder fixes, and still thought they deserved more money for portioning at least 70% of their pre-existing art assets to sell for exorbitant prices . They knew it was unfinished and broken and they SOLD IT TO YOU ANYWAY. And wanted more money on top of it. You spineless fanboys.
---
The game still has connection issues. What, exactly has improved so much that you need to complain about criticism as if it's so off base?
---
This place is THE biggest circle jerk, and you people only criticize when it's "safe" and popular.
---
Beth just tweeted that there will be a delay on it's appearance in the store.
---
Yes, bu PubG 76 doesnt have the same ring to it
---
Oh yeah especially the dog food and wood- I always ran out of wood when I first started - kind of a good thing because i'd go off exploring for wood and then stumble into new things like "oh piece of candy" and forget why I needed wood lol
---
I might need a new mouse. It never happened before until recently. Except that when I‚Äôm not in combat it works just fine.
---
considering the nuclear winter cards are supposed to be strictly for taht mode, and won;t carry over to adventure/survival, i'd say they are going to be post-patching the patch.
---
I suppose I may have to use a gun sometimes, I was planning to fill strength with Iron Fist, Incisor, Martial Artist, Blocker and Barbarian though
---
Worked for me as well.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox and I did that, maybe I‚Äôll restart my console
---
Yea, I don‚Äôt think I can get it on xbox yet
---
Ok. It's fun. Deal with it.
---
Hopefully you'll finally be able to put her down.
---
I was planning on never even touching power armor, do you use any rifle perk cards?
---
I would say its more structured in terms of story lines, quests and challenges. Little has changed regarding multiplayer aspects, outside of Survival and the new Nuclear Winter mode. Its not GREAT for a lone wanderer, but its an overall better product now.
---
Well, tons of improvements, new side quests, enemies, backpack
---
They can see who I am, and they can verify that I'm not making up the interaction, aka I exist as a person and did take a trip to Dallas, confirmed by community managers who are employees of Bethesda Softworks
---
The combat changes definitely improved PvP, it feels less like you're fighting against invisible spider webs and much more snappy.
---
Did they also update consoles to 60 fps? Thats pretty cool
---
Cheers, I believe the word for people who all think the same is cult, or at least boring.
---
Ayoooo got that pizza pie dick
---
Sounds like a scan/repair the game is needed. F76 uses a single ESM file which is basically all the games data.
---
Same here. What a mess, but it was not surprise at all. Bethesda keeps delivering broken updates.
---
So instead of dancing around it with your little winky face trying to be coy, why don't you just say it?
---
Wrong, the trial is live from the second it becomes downloadable. If it becomes available on the 10th and you cant download it before the 11th then that is your own problem. If it doesnt go live before the 11th then ita a 6 day trial
---
If I was able to I'd give you an award for visibility. No pun intended. I just think this could be something relatively simple to implement, and impact thousands for the better. Have my upvote.
---
Still love this game and nuclear winter is *^%}ing sick!
---
good idea.  too bad most of mine went into a suitcase at a train station loooong ago....
---
We don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs available on literally every system aside from Xbox. It‚Äôs quite frustrating.
---
Good work. Do we have the Nuclear Winter perks?
---
I am also not a BR fan but this is fun.
---
Thanks! I‚Äôll probably load it up later today and try to get back out there
---
It's nothing you should give a shit about.  Read the words I bothered typing.  There is ZERO chance that they're going to lock shit behind these special checks, they are going to exist for at LEAST additional flavor and at MOST might have some minor effects on quests.
---
Hold on a sec -- you didn't even realize I was a different person and you want to lecture me on "you need to read the preceding comments"? 
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAAHHAHAAHAHHAHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
---
For sure, I spent a lot of time yesterday running around buying things from Vendor Bots because I kept seeing "Max" as my cap total! thanks to all that have been patronizing my and my plan purchasing habit!  A VERY good issue to have!
---
How about arrows made of the robot protest signs?
---
If its been awhile since you did a full move/delete/rebuild I would recommend it anyway. Thats the only way I have ever ended up with a budget increase. But if its been less than 50 levels or so since the last time you did one, then its likely negligible.
---
How much is Bethesda paying you?! Duper!!!
---
Jk I was not excited about it but it actually looks like I‚Äôll enjoy it. Starting with nothing sounds fun.
---
There is a difference between argument and discussion as most people here can't grasp.
---
I've opened up some NW packs and didn't get any new perks yet. Might take a while for people to find them
---
Disregard I went dumb
---
All BR is luck based when it comes to loot, that wont change ever
---
&gt;I don't like rewarding companies for shit behavior so I would really ask anyone thinking about coming back whether it's worth rewarding BGS with any money after the absolute mess this game is/was for the 6+ months since its release.
---
Again, literally your exact words.  You can lie all you want, but you said what you said. Don't accuse us of moving the goalposts when you literally can't be honest about things you said just mere minutes ago.
---
I don't know, but it's a common (and brought up) suggestion as a QoL improvement.   
---
**Disclaimer:**   
---
The Holotape issue rides the line between bug and QoL in my opinion, and as important as I agree it is, I'd rather have a stability fix over a slider, if given the choice, but I'm am hopeful in time we will get both.
---
While I've had moments of a seemingly overwhelming amount of enemies coming at me, it's in specific spawn points like Whitesprings where they get bottle necked but luckily I haven't experienced anything like what you mentioned and never a line of them following me around.
---
We get it Beth, you like using profiles on Reddit to sell your product.
---
Telling somebody that helps nothing
---
I saw something require rank 105
---
Doesn't work :/
---
Not much of a royale or pvper but it is pretty fun I played a match n loved how balanced it was
---
Currently unarmed is op because the meat hook is bugged and gets bonus damage from unarmed AND one handed. So 60% more damage than normal. Get a bloodied meat hook with bonus PA damage and you get some stupid high numbers. Use a shotgun with maxed enforcer perks to cripple scorchbeast wings and make them land, then run in and smack em
---
Who knows, maybe they'll actually get around to fixing adventure one of these days.
---
Angry much? Lol
---
yes please add the ability to make enemy cons and markers show up as blue or something red/green is horrible for us color blind. Almost lost my first NW match because the last enemy looked green.
---
Higher ranks unlock more of Vault 51 and the holotapes scattered around, more perk cards to use in the mode, and also this crate icon pops up in my rewards when I level up as well but I don't know what that is.
---
play on ps4.  smooth as af.
---
Yeah i was being a wiseass
---
It was never an issue AFAIK. Lots of people complained they were banned for mods or for regular play, but every single one of them eventually gets caught, or admits to, cheating. Never heard of someone getting banned for the mods mentioned here.
---
Imo, I'd sacrifice Barbarian.  Flat damage reduction, like Serendipity, Lone Wanderer, and Dodgy, will outclass perks like Barbarian every time.
---
O geez cant wait to see my tse weapons, i have four of them.  My dragon was already pushing 2500
---
Type about what you like and you wont have time to type about what you dont!
---
Sure! It's great. The combat feels so much snappier and smoother. I got 7 kills with a nuke! Having a \*blast\* haha.
---
Having hope and fear about something =/= whining.
---
You're just being pathetic.
---
Haha, thanks.
---
Can‚Äôt wait to start a shady fighting club with the boxing ring
---
Marquis de Arrows is my French RP character
---
Are non bloodied weapons viable? I'm not sure I want to be that much of a glass cannon whilst sprinting at creatures like the queen
---
More of an observation than a gripe, the bad RNG is on my half.
---
Not at the moment but I might in the future. Having the furious on the handmade helps a TON with this as I just save it for flying and long range aggro. Anything that gets close gets the pole hook,gorgnaks axe in power armor( also don't 1 shot things which is nice for nuke zones) and the DCG has to eat but I have a instagating one and it usually ends up with 1 swing 1 kill on anything not legendary or extremely end game. I am also level 138 and this is my second player since beta.
---
Don't take anything for granted. Many things have been changed from previous fallout games, from weapon damage to ammo types to chem effects and even the junk that random scrap yields
---
Thanks man. I have glasses that kind of help but I feel like I let my team down because I couldn't see some things that were being marked.
---
Was going for more of a yellow Jigglypuff.
---
Im seriously impressed how well it worked.
---
Expected to walk into a laggy broken mess but no.
---
Got six kills on the first round and had a blast.
---
Definetly positively surprised, and i havent played br:s in months due to losing interest
---
That's worth maybe 500‚Ç¨ in 2019.
---
Even if you do melee only, I suggest at least 3 points in perception for glow sight perk as it gives a bonus 60% damage to glowing enemies with any weapon.
---
Agreed!  Both this and No Man's Sky I have really enjoyed seeing the game makers stick with a product and support the faithful players throughout the social media barrage and make some amazing improvements/evolutions.
---
Yes! It's annoyingly difficult talking over the music without yelling at your friends in a party.
---
Awesome.. if they would fix us Pre-Order peeps' issue, I might say my 59.99 was worth it..
---
I just want(NEED) the credit for discovering all of the possible locations on the map. Can't get the Atoms rewarded when it says you need 2 more here, 3 more there, etc.. and the entire map is already discovered.
---
I have a camp in the mire and one time a scorchbeast spawned at my house which is near a hill - I have a bloodied deathclaw gauntlet and I was able to JUMP and hit it twice and I killed it. Knocked that sucker right out of the sky.
---
My revolutionary sword does the same amount of damage as before, I don't have and melee perks or mutations so mabey the perks/mutations got nerfed.
---
&gt;is/was 
---
see that, that's me covering my ass. The slash is an OR. Context, friend.
---
That means I don't know if the game is bad, or was bad. Was implies it is no longer bad. Meaning it is decent if not good now.
---
i wish i knew as well confused i opened the perks and got a card idk if that was it though
---
I mean with my friend. You can‚Äôt invite people to join a team at the main menu &amp; you can‚Äôt during the winter lobby. I wanted to play with my brother but if I turn fill lobby off &amp; start one I can‚Äôt invite him still once I get into the vault waiting area.
---
Im sure this kind of shit posting is the ideal way of contributing to this forum.Even 4chan would be a preferable place for discussion.
---
1060 and i5-7300 1500 euro setup stop with the jokes ok.
---
The nice part of the BR is that you get loot for winning that transfers over to the main survival mode
---
People were complaining about this shit in November and it‚Äôs still not been added. It‚Äôs comical.
---
That shit doesn't sound normal in the least, takes 20 sec here to go from NW select to lobby - then another 20 to spawn on map.
---
And FPS is actually better than in adventure, kek.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt it be nice if we were older?
---
I thought that‚Äôs why it was 52 people fighting to the death until there was only 1, so 51 corpses. It could be a Roswell reference though.
---
1500 for that setup? you got ripped off good sir.
---
So you use your existing character but none of your weapons or armour, right?
---
It's easy to run a Melee + Rifle build as the melee perks are in strength and most rifle perks are in perception. Works pretty well for me :)
---
I only made it half way I was 23 when I died it was very fun I was paranoid didn't know what to expect especially in the forest area.
---
i know i want me some new cosmetics
---
Fallnight?
---
i didnt even think about that Fast Travelling thing. That makes so much sense now...
---
It was a blast, a great change of pace from survival and adventure mode.
---
That's hillarious omg... Time move faster!!!
---
Go to base game, scroll down to add on/demo. Boom.
---
I'd say try r/fo76FilthyCasuals
---
Give me your shit before you kys tho pls.
---
Love to know why I'm getting downvoted..
---
Oh man that sounds really neat. Thank you for sharing!
---
Man I just want a way to buy it. It doesn't appear that apple has any android market apparatus to take money.
---
It should be right now, for a week but don‚Äôt know how PS works
---
This comment alone has decided for me.  I gotta stick with it now just so I can try to live up to that level of pure god damn alpha
---
They mentioned the below in the patch notes today so it looks encouraging! 
---
"By earning Overseer Ranks, you‚Äôll unlock new cosmetics that you can use in all Fallout 76 game modes, such as Power Armor and weapon paints, C.A.M.P. and Workshop objects, and much more."
---
In fortnite its visible to every too, so that must mean making it visible to only your team can be hard to accomplish
---
Not out yet.
---
I respect you
---
...only to have her rise again in a nearby assaultron body, faster, deadlier, and snarkier.  Cue boss battle music.
---
Read the patch notes from today.
---
Team chat
---
&gt; 5- Mutations should be disabled in Nuclear Winter. Period end of story.
---
afaik they are disabled. I atleast couldn't use mine. No healing factor, no high jumps, nothing.
---
HA that‚Äôs a joke, I‚Äôve  lost all hope for EA. I remember when Anthem was all hyped up and they said it was the Destiny killer. I just chuckled and kept on playing D2.
---
I checked a moment ago and I couldn't find a way in yet. Maybe after Nuclear Winter is no longer in "sneak peak"?
---
Gunna give it a go as soon as the kids go to bed
---
True, that sort of sweetens the deal. I hope it's good, just got to see how the new combat mechanics and the tweaks work in the mode.
---
Why you being a dick, dude?
---
Chill, man. I 100% guarantee that you would'nt speak like this were he sitting in front of you... talk to him like he's a person, FFS.
---
Also how much ram do you have and which programs are running in the background.
---
Wait never mind I'm stupid, I found Creature crusher which makes you deal 100% more damage to animals. Many other perks have had their effects modified though, like master commando gives +40% damage with automatic rifles and lockpick/hacker let you pick any level locks/computers
---
I can cover some but not all, and I was asked to leave my pages and pages of notes behind, in large part because my shorthand is unreadable so they had no clue what I was walking out with, so it will be from an imperfect recollection.  
---
The delay specifically?    
---
I doubt we would get a complete and honest answer here,'to potentially damaging PR wise, but my guess(s) would be..   
---
-Due to the short B.E.T.A. and (IMHO) I sufficiently rigorous testing they honestly thought it was ready.  
---
-Game breaking and majority stability issues didn't become fully realized until after launch and players got unfettered access to '76.    
---
-Even if there were a few known serious issues a delay could have been seen as much more costly, from both a PR and sales perspective than the fallout (no pun) of a release.  If this was the cases, they likely learned that might not be the case
---
That seems plausible to me. Like I said, I think I had mine running at just above 310, if I remember correctly, and (unlike our narcissistic friend down there) Im sure there are better ways for me to optimize my build that I wasn't taking advantage of.
---
Yes, you literally spawn in only in the vault 51 jumpsuit. When you find armor like wood you get the whole set. I didn't actually see any creatures or terminals and lockpicked containers but didn't do a whole lot of searching either the storm closes in fast. Weapons are in supply containers hidden around and they are automatically put onto the favorite wheel. Your characters only influence I believe is the SPECIAL numbers
---
Haven‚Äôt you all read ‚ÄúIf you give a ghoul a radroach‚Äù?
---
Nah. No more whiny babies on reddit.
---
Yeah load time is too long
---
My D1 Xbox One gets the job done, have no clue about PC
---
Idk what Overwatch has to do with anything, that game wasn't near unplayable in release unlike 76. I'm not saying it's unfinished in the sense that they forgot to put the latter half of the main story in there or something, I'm saying it never should have released in the state it was and should have went through months of more development.
---
I genuinely would've done what you did a bit, by stepping away from 76/FO to a degree, but I would've probably had to just disappear entirely. Something I'd see, even in game, would make me be frustrated and want to say something. Like *"Ugh I can't wait for... etc etc... when this will finally be fixed"* which obviously would've been bad lol
---
But also just as you said, seeing all the crap on Reddit that you have the knowledge the say something back, and... again... can't. It might not be *too* hard to keep one's mouth shut on details, but when they're things you're genuinely excited about, that only makes it that much more difficult. *Nevermind* the fact that you didn't just have a few details... you had a truckload of info! Hell, as you've said, you **still** have things you have to be silent about! 
---
I can imagine that these points are a huge factor for why the others wanted to remain anonymous. The onslaught of "Give me details!" by people --not just strangers which are easier to ignore, but from close friends-- would be quite the additional burden to stack on top of the one you *already* have.   
---
Which if that IS the reason for their choice of anonymity, I hope Beth realizes they (Beth) have placed their faith in the right people, because you guys were able to keep silent but have gone to extra lengths to avoid temptation :) It might make them less apprehensive in the future to do similar things, as well as more willing to open up lines of communications to the non-crazies so they (you) can leapfrog the normal bug/issue reporting channels :)
---
Apologies. I misinterpreted what you meant.
---
Thanks man, I know it's not game changing but it should be enough help to make the entrance into the game alot smoother
---
Where do you work? I have a poor friend who does HVAC in the mountains outside of Denver and he had to drive out east to the plains today.. so he went 3 hours east, then back up into the mountains across town, then down through traffic to get home. Poor guy won‚Äôt be home until like 8 tonight üò≠
---
Tell that to the guy in my squad using chameleon, but maybe it's a bug
---
The mutations are disabled, but I did find a mutation serum in game. 
---
Also, I‚Äôd hate to have to worry about food and water. Nuclear Winter is a fast game mode, I like it as is. A great change of pace from adventure.
---
And the level 2 reward? What it is? A bronze logo I see, but what it does?
---
I do get knocked a fair amount. I put on mysterious savior to help with that. Dodgy also helps a ton. I would imagine other gauntlets would be viable. Especially if you stack a few of the food items that buff melee, take a fury, and even better with a bobble head or magazine.

I killed a squad solo I was so happy , was happy how the items slots auto equipped the auto equip of armor , it‚Äôs pretty interesting at how they did it

That's how others do the quest...hes getting it...

"and added 73 new perk cards..." "some of them new and exclusive to the game mode" is slightly confusing (if there are 73 new ones, any of them will also be new for NW), but it sounds more like they added a bunch, and some are only for NW.
---
Bruh, there ain‚Äôt nothing to contribute to this forum, you‚Äôre too stupid to create a platform for any intelligent debate or criticism. From my observation, this forum has been about roasting your small, single-minded ass, for having the audacity to make empty arguments on a sub dedicated to the player base?? You should go back to Facebook arguments, probably more suited to you.
---
LONGBOW!!!!!
---
I'd love for them to add dreadlocks. Would add an unkempt look to the characters like they belong in the wastes
---
the game is still shit
---
Nice try fallout sub
---
76 wasn't "near unplayable" at release. What are you on about? I literally played the entire main storyline from start to finish in the first like month and a half. 
---
You could literally say that *any* game could have waited another couple of months to come out. I can't wait to see what happens the first time someone finds a bug in CP2077. Again, you're using "unfinished" to mean "I didn't like the state this game released in".
---
I‚Äôm cool with no npcs. Doesn‚Äôt bother me that they‚Äôre back
---
Yes. Me too.
---
No problem :3 Combat also feels very fluid and less jumpy so that was enjoyable
---
Sounds like a you problem. Update your stuff.
---
I 100% disagree with you. However my gameplay must be a lot different.  No crashes great match up. Love the quick pace. Hell one match someone, somehow launch a nuke!
---
i got level 5 and acquired ‚ÄúSmall NW Stash‚Äù but don‚Äôt know how to get it
---
Y‚Äôall just can‚Äôt help yourselves, can you?
---
It‚Äôs a fun change of pace from Adventure and Survival modes.
---
I usually play solo also. I was able to revive another player doing Paradise. This event or Encryptid are both good. Worry not.
---
lol, right?  
---
OP needs to calm tf down.  There's a fuckton of merit badges you can earn to do the tadpole quest and if god forbid you need to interact with another player, I think you'll survive it :)
---
Oh shit really?! That's awesome!
---
I have a feeling that won't matter. Most of these new players likely won't understand leveled zones and you can Fast Travel to camps as a relatively quicker easier way to get around the map initially before you've explored the area.
---
I literally haven't crashed once and haven't waited for more than 2 minutes
---
I would also agree you wanna put the points into luck for Serendipity. Saved my grass more times than I can count AND it works on fall damage lol
---
I'm sure if I had nerd rage maxed out, which I don't...I've only got one point in it, I probably would have gotten around what you're hitting with it. I think mine was 313 with the one point in nerd rage.
---
Its also the same error code server maintenance gives so it could have just been down for ashort server side patch
---
Oic ok, thats still cool though
---
Thank you! Passing this to the team
---
OH Please, Oh Please.... let it be just stabilization fixes.
---
Woooo!!! PARTY LIQUOR!!!
---
Full game, The new DLC is a battle royal but you are free too try any part of the game. 
---
Hope you enjoy it.
---
Agreed. i hated Fortnite and CSGO danger zone but nuclear winter fucking rocks!!! Especially having a nice team where everyone communicates and all. I'm sweating like a loaded fatman in nuke zone
---
Most companies would just cut their losses and run
---
Not Bethesda. They're genuinely trying to improve it and make it better. You gotta give them credit for their dedication to saving the game. Reminds me of how Destiny 2 was in it's first year. 2 years later and hardly anybody badmouths the game anymore and the game's very much active (even more now that Activision is out of the picture and Bungie's reverted to being indie)
---
Can someone buy from my vending machines while I'm playing?
---
Are you on a 15 year old PC, because it's working amazingly for me.
---
*edit: Original post was saying that no one attacked me*
---
No, it did. The fact that only one person actually gave a real positive argument on the improvement of the game and everyone else attacked me or my time played or whatever other insignificant point or non sequitur they could make shows me just how miserable everyone here is. I get it though, after the last 6 months of what you put up with in this game, all that's left are the diehard fans and you all are tired of dissent and negativity. But you better get better at dealing with it if you want this game and sub to be more appealing to newcomers or people returning.
---
Apparently there‚Äôs a delay on Microsoft‚Äôs end. We just have to wait for the store to update.
---
You can do a duo just fine. I think the only option not available is solo? (Not sure.)
---
But if you just want a duo, turn off the Fill option and it won't use the matchmaking.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/yPcygdH.png](https://i.imgur.com/yPcygdH.png)
---
I think it needs to be a reactive target. so that the more damage it takes in a single hit the larger the geyser of blood that fountains out like a gwar concert covering everyone. in the aria.
---
New guy - starting tonight on PS4.  I am a 31 year old married dude...could use some help if anyone wants to!  Name on PS4 is same as on here.
---
Push to talk is a thing. I'd definitely not have open area chat in any survival/pvp mode.
---
Yea that would probably do it
---
I totally agree on all points, but it just not my thing. Having played a few matches now, its worse for me than i thought, since I lag and stutter just like in Adventure mode, except its even more dangerous
---
Nope, just tired of browsing new and half the threads are the same damn question that could be simply answered by reading the subreddit or just playing the game they already own and forming their own opinion.
---
It's just being lazy.
---
Theres a fill option to pair you with randoms
---
Just chill do something else someone will hyu on here when it‚Äôs up I almost guarantee it

---
 &gt; Thank you! Passing this to the team
---
Okay, first off, don't be a dick about it. Shit like this is why you're getting downvoted.
---
Secondly, I'm not assuming shit other than I thought they'd release it in the morning or some shit. Furthermore, any time is convenient, i'm just surprised it's not up yet. I never implied or acted like they owed me shit. I merely asked a question for my friends who don't have a reddit so i could figure out what the hell was going on, and you've been snarky from the get go. God forbid someone actually want help.
---
I was actually wondering what is the purpose of camps in the NW mode - do you need to repair or just somewhere to hide temporarily? Can you move the camp?
---
It's a pretty big radius. For example, If you're at The Flatwoods Church, you can be heard all the way to the Red Rocket there. Not sure exactly how far.
---
If your team is alive theres a chance they win, if not no
---
Yea, it was tons of fun playing but made me realize I have no friends.
---
Then i Would have all exept the wendigo, thats neat
---
Not anger, disappointment. It's honestly really entertaining reading all these posts by people like you who eat Bethesda's shit up even after they fucked you in the ass. I have 2 brain cells to rub together and as such I saw that this game was going to be shit from a mile away and didn't and will never spend a cent on it. This sub is just a place I go to when I feel like laughing at some idiots.
---
They said there's a "fill" option to join a random team. Is that not available?
---
I'm just glad I subbed to Origin Premier for a month and never bought the game.
---
Not unless you just want to spectate.
---
no it's a 6
---
fallout 76
---
vault 76

:/

Juicehead did a live stream and had the class freak card and a serum that he was able to use. It was the twisted muscles mutation.
---
Part of me didn't believe at first but it's just too badass a picture, I have to believe it's true so I can live it one day
---
Did not place my  CAMP blueprint down. Honestly the storm was moving so fast I didn't get a chance to make use of my CAMP other than a foundation and wall to try to trap players. I assume not because it's a pure fighting mode chances are they won't appear in the CAMP or on map.
---
I've played 6 games so far, no issues man. Seems to run better than adventure mode
---
&gt;Perk Loadouts
---
Talk to me! where are these?
---
Go look at the picture lol
---
It can take time to populate in the storefront but will be active today. Thanks for your patience!
---
Didn't even realize I had teammates for the first few rounds... sorry about that guys..

---
Shouldn't this sort of thing been done months ago? Maybe when in beta? Thats my issue. Games are now sold as incomplete beta concepts, not complete games.
---
How else can I hide??
---
Thanks for the praise, I'll admit it's also selfish, I want a better game to play! ;)  
---
Don't feel bad about complaining, it's our right as paying consumers, but be constructive, file bug reports, even if you think it's something they would already know,'because you'd be surprised how many times everyone knows about an issue but the Dev's, because no one submitted it, assuming the next sufferer would.  
---
They didn't go into great detail about the structure of the teams (or I don't remember those details).   
---
That specific question however I can answer in part, they do have separate groups for QA and development.   
---
The "Revision Control" issues they have I mentioned, and also called them out when they gave (what I perceived) me a snow job.  
---
They would not/could not go into great detail, but they said it is something they are working on getting a better handle on.
---
I am aware of this, but sadly the randoms have just either not spoken or went off by themselves
---
You‚Äôre welcome
---
Well guess I gotta shuffle my build around a bit then
---
You can gain mutations during game, maybe that's what happened?
---
Lol sure sounds angry lol You assume I have no critical thoughts on the game to make yourself feel good. Have fun out there!
---
Not to mention Fallout NV, the new darling of the FO community, which pain her with a bug where you could lose your followers permanently by sending them to the casino...
---
Ruined a pretty hefty save file. Traded it in the next day. Bought it 8 months later after it was fixed.
---
It's not about content being locked. It's a playstyle that I enjoy which I obviously didnt plan for. I imagine others feel the same way. A re-spec would be appropriate.
---
You come off like an asshole. Why you so mad?
---
Or you just make a backup of your custom.ini and remove the archive lines for your mods. Just switch between the two INIs depending on what mode you want to play.
---
Since it always autoplays please add a radio version of the jukebox.. shutting it off &amp; turning on radios every time I come back to camp is exhausting üôèüèª
---
Yes, a 66% loss in damage output with melee.
---
Booyah.
---
EDIT: Actually not sure whether is just melee, or bloodied, or the adrenal reaction mutations.
---
I just know that yesterday upon logging out my DCG did at least twice the damage it does right now.
---
Gonna take all the perks and equipment off and all the usual shenanigans and relog and hope this is just a mirage or something.
---
EDIT2: Not a mirage. It is less than half than it was yesterday. Too frustrated to look into it right now. Logging out and waiting for the inevitable addendum to the patch notes in a couple of hours saying 'we forgot to mention that we horrifically butchered x, y or z. That is all.'
---
Maybe they will learn to form their own opinions :)
---
Perfect. Thanks
---
Just saw a tweet that its been delayed....Microsoft error being worked...
---
No. You have nothing when you spawn in.
---
https://nukesdragons.com
---
It's actually running smoothly despite it being in pre beta. Haven't crashed once and the wait is fairly short. The only problem I have is a lag spike when building in BR. On PS4 at least.
---
Only if the one he voices is a killable NPC. I miss the days of being able to kill every NPC and can't wait for next game from Obsidian!
---
But is there an ETA? Saying it will be today can mean a lot of hours waiting.
---
You do realize that they're not deserving of praise for doing something that they should have done from the start. Right?
---
Ok awesome thanks I'll figure it out! Because that girl was PISSED.
---
You said you dont play BR games which is fine but all your other points is what makes a BR game Especially the luck factor. In BR if your good  you will still likly.lose if you get shit loot.
---
Just died because i forgot weapons also come in semi auto variants.. stood there like an idiot wondering whats wrong with my gun
---
Someday you will do it. I believe in you! It def happened tho! Hill + Marsupial and Strange in numbers- I was flyin man.
---
No, I believe you can only have 7 at one time,  and card packs only give 1 card, but the cards are much better by themselves now.
---
Well if non bloodied doesn't work out I can always hunt one down and see if I can live with being so fragile yet powerful
---
I was in basically instantly, only played a few games though
---
Nope x.x tried that and a few other random methods. Such as teaming up ig and going to the location of vault 51. Everything is greyed out when I try to invite when at the menu or before you get put into a lobby.
---
Should be able to change it in settings. That being said in game chat has been buggy as hell for me lately.
---
the original post said "not in this thread." Dont misrepresent me or put words in my mouth I didn't say. The reason for the edit is I wanted to de-escalate your emotional state. Clearly, you're not wanting that kind of friendly effort.
---
You should go do something other than post in /FO76 for maybe an hour. Go clear your head, because you're really wound up and you're seeing enemies in every shadow.
---
When I start feeling this way, I like to play video games with my friends. I suggest you try Fallout 76. It's really good.
---
aside from not being able to use power armor with fists, they are very powerful. before all the two shot explosives were dominating the world my first toon was fists. i didnt have to put that many points into damage and a lot of my build was defense and quality of life. i was able to 2-3 shot almost everything and scorchbeasts died as soon as they landed and i absolutely never died. i'd go pistols or shotguns to give yourself ranged since you can double dip from strength or agility. not really worth it to try and go rifles since perception isnt going to help you out much past rifles. 
---
this is assuming you dont enjoy power armor, because i absolutely hated having to wear it. you could do heavy weapons instead of shotgun. theres a few builds that let you do nuke zones in hazmat suits but you have to get all your defense from perks alone
---
I‚Äôm still getting an error saying vault Tec engineers are getting the servers back up(error code 3:0:8444249301319680)
---
At the time I was trying for well over 30 mins with friends in my party playing the new mode. For some reason when a update happens 30% of ppl cant sign in when its finished. Weird
---
Not a fan of any BR's , but this is pretty cool so far!!
---
If you get in a squad and everyone has mic's even better and got my first win when everyone is able to communicate...PLUG IN THEM DAMN MICS PLP!!
---
#FREEWOOBIE
---
1 week free trial? lol no. the trial is for the battle royal mode for existing players.
---
Lies, deception!
---
Yeah I really think it could benefit from a server wide notification as well, but instead i'm just frantically messaging anyone over level 50 like "ARKTOS IS ON!"
---
&gt; because of avarice, or lack of care, etc...
---
I mean... did FO76 at launch seem like a "Cross your t's and dot your i's. We're going to put in a lot of effort and make this perfect" kind of effort?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning
---
I'm sorry if you get the impression I've been seduced...  
---
All I can suggest reading is my comment replies in this and the cross post on the Root Fallout sub.    
---
I openly criticize Bethesda in response to constructive comments, hold them accountable for instances they attempted a "snow job" to valid questions that deserve an answer, and will continue to post the bug Roundups, adding to the ones in place and rebuilding the original "specific" pages.  
---
The multiple public list of issues, many not yet acknowledged and  Addressed by Bethesda is anything but kind to them, and prevents them from claiming "all is well with the world".  
---
That said, riding the very fine line between a Fan (which I admit to), a harsh but decidedly neutral critic, and finally an unconstructive rage filled Reddit troll is hard, and I Struggled with the tone in this post. 
---
Again I apologize if I give the impression of a seduced "yes man", because I've failed to an extent if that's true and you are not yourself trolling.
---
That would be cool but I think it would be betrer if he had commercials for his merchant business

Dog the bounty hunter?
---
You run into glowing enemies quite frequently at higher levels. The most popular method to grind xp and legendaries is to farm bloated glowing ghouls in nuke zones.
---
I don't assume you don't have critical thoughts on the game, I assume you have no critical thought at all lol. The moment someone on reddit turns to passive aggressiveness, you know you hurt their feelings. It's just banter, don't take it so seriously lol. Alright then, have a nice day.
---
&gt; Pete Hines said we would eventually get fully offline play with traditional mod support at some point down the road when 76 was announced
---
They said more than one year I think. I'm also expecting that but not soon.
---
Fair point. I think most who have no interest in Battle Royale will not be converted with this. I like this mode a lot but your not gonna find me on Fortnite or  PUBG because of it.
---
As for technical shortcomings I think I have been fairly lucky so I should have mentioned that results may vary.
---
Great! Another disappointing patch...it's the third time in a row. No new contents ( a mission from time to time is NOT sufficient for an MMO ), still not a proper endgame, no new enemies, old glitch still there unfixed. All the effort for a miserable battle royale mode. GG bethesda.
---
What do you get when you win I won one but it didn‚Äôt explain it very well
---
Why should other people convince you to stick around?  What makes you so special?
---
Hey, that rhymed!
---
Don't know why they didn't build in a mod disabler into the game mode.  Totally agree in spirit but the implementation is just bad.

So much has happened- I think you would definitely benefit from watching the E3 stream - and looking at the most recent patches - here's today's for you : [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/byylhe/fallout\_76\_nuclear\_winter\_patch\_notes\_june\_10\_2019/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/byylhe/fallout_76_nuclear_winter_patch_notes_june_10_2019/)

Omg yes.   
---
My friends list is large enough my game freezes for 3 to 15 seconds every damn time I open it.  
---
Will be on the next "UI" bug page I make.
---
Teamwork should be op dumb Ass,  go cry somewhere else.
---
It's there near the bottom
---

---
Second! As I am not seeing it.
---
Maybe increases with overseer rank?
---
Odd because it is usually the level 50s or 80s following the new players around.
---
How do people have cosmetic items. Can you transfer your characters appearance (clothes) from adventure mode??
---
play the game.. stay if you like it leave if you dont..
---
I like it.. so i keep playing it...
---
Wooooah woah woah...the Maxon coat was in the atom shop??
---
Okay firstly, if you think i care about a few downvotes then think again. My mood or feelings dont change because of a few virtual numbers. I am well aware that people find it hard to swallow the truth so in return downvotes are given. Im tired of people not using any gumption or writing absolute bollocka becuase they feel like they have been wronged. Its pathetic, this isnt aimed just at you. Its aimed at alot of people recently.
---
But whilst im here
---
So you never implied or acted like they owed you anything?
---
" Its 2:29PM for Maryland and 1:29PM for Houston. It should be up regardless"
---
Again......... "It should be up regardless"
---
Acting like you are owed this.
---
When I won my ranking went from 0 to 4, got a few perk packs and some other stuff (Can't remember what sorry, was quite excited)
---
Glad I could give some hope, which is the intent, if just a cautious glimmer of such.
---
Can somebody post a pic of this??
---
*Side eyes RifleGaming*
---
All I see is the store is standard $30 and tricentennial $40. Nothing in the add on section except offers to buy atoms
---
Go find them in the atomic shop, then select them as a nuclear winter favourite.
---
Todd Howard recently came out and said he released 76 knowing it wouldn't do well is the only example you need
---
Do it from the main menu and access the social menu.
---
There are FO players..... and.... "those" guys..
---
I'm a FO player.. and now FO76
---
*Correction: Either a vault suit or a custom outfit if you hearted one for the mode. But it's the same either way: everybody starts with nothing but the clothes on their backs
---
In main menu inv people via social
---
It‚Äôs the fallout 76 appreciation bundle. You buy 1000 atoms and get repair kits (useless) a coat (maxxon)  and 1500 ATX
---
Go to the main menu and invite them from the social menu.
---
I am just super chafed that for whatever reason your voice has more weight than the rest of us. I can already tell reading your post that you and I have almost nothing in common and it really concerns me that you seemingly have had more influence here than the rest of the community.
---
It doesn't have an option there either. You sure?
---
Go to the Atom Shop and press the NW Favorite option on the cosmetics that you purchased.
---
I've been seeing people complain about the Fucking dumbest shit.  Good to show some people just want something to bitch regardless. To much foliage are you fucking serious?
---
Dang it. I'm on PS4.
---
who gives a shit bro, a game is a game in the end, whether you enjoy it or not. Just move on lols.
---
Thanks for sticking with the slog/wall of text and for the feedback.   
---
There is, in my opinion, hope, we just collectively need to keep the pressure up constructively!
---
The patch notes said you need to make a new character.
---
Those npc's are fake my dude bruh. You feel me now?
---
Mama Murphy over here.
---
If you‚Äôre a new player..
---
Use your existing character. The only thing that carries over are your special stats. Not your perks.
---
Thanks for putting up with the wall of text, and happy to share
---
Agreed. It didn't really address the real problems. They admitted that they knew about the problems beforehand but launched it in that state anyway.
---
Where did you find nuke codes? Any specific types of places or just totally random?
---
Have you tried accessing the Social Menu thru the Main menu and adding them to team?
---
Does the ring insta kill you? Or do you take damage and have a chance to get out?
---
The mad lads did it. They actually put Maxson's coat in the game
---
Will give it a go now, thanks
---
It's up now. Just search for the standard game and it should show "install".
---
Took me a couple mins the first time but since then it is relatively quick. I play on PS4 so results my vary.
---
I agree a bit, but also if it draws more people in then that's fine. Its optional so if we dont like it we wont bother with it but I have a feeling it's going to be a lot of fun for people that enjoy this game type.
---
I think a lot of it is down to labeling. If they called it team death match, or made it a kind of king of the hill where teams had to try to hold a silo or multiple teams had to hold all 3 while trying to launch nukes to win, people would maybe hate less. Who knows though. These days they could have released the entire game as free, and all this DLC free and people would STILL complain about something.
---
Just got it, first time purchasing atoms had to have that coat.
---
I can't look it up for you right now, but things like scars aren't part of the Face or Body editing options - it's another top-level option in the same menu as those and Sex.  Don't remember what the option is called, but that's where you can edit marks, blemishes, makeup, etc.
---
Well I‚Äôm confident you are, that or you‚Äôre 12 years old. You‚Äôve now contributed sometime to this forum, and you‚Äôre yet to make any reasonable observations, arguments or points about anything, you continue to say stupid stuff, it‚Äôs amazing.
---
I was following your previous posts for my own personal enjoyment. I‚Äôm sorry, but some of the stuff you comment is so low effort, out of the picture, out of the world, that I can‚Äôt help myself to feel bad for you and laugh.
---
Agreed! Have my upvote. I'm guessing there may have been a duping issue and punchbowls? No idea though.
---
Just use your regular character. You  start with nothing. Doesn‚Äôt matter what your build in Adventure is. Has no effect.
---
I was so surprised when I saw the article on their site! Weirdest part was the lack of publicity they gave it, I just came across it by chance.
---
Hmm.. I don't know what it is but it looks like I took a carry weight hit as well. My base used to be 280 with just perk cards and SPECIAL, not counting backpack and now it's down to 250. Disabled and re-enabled all my weight related perk cards but no dice. I don't think it's weapon reclassifications...
---
Ermmmmmmmmmm.....you might want to do a bit of research mate. Its a free week on all platforms
---
I do quite hate power armor, never wear it.  I was thinking of maybe using crossbows for range and when they're added swapping to bows
---
Looks like a lot of stuff ripped from the creation club. Not sure they've ever done that before.
---
Also, are rewards given out during this NW beta week?
---
In the atomic shop you can mark outfits you‚Äôve bought as favorite and you‚Äôll equip them.
---
Faction war pvpve events seems most likely, and maybe what npcs are hostile and which are friendly
---
Question, did you newer account get banned or are you referencing the original set?  
---
Can understand and empathize, assuming I was innocent and got banned, especially when actively trying to improve the community, I'd likely not have the fortitude to keep going.
---
Watch those will be in the next atom bundle...
---
Does it still say they're still down?
---
Hey, any chance you would be up for making some serums for trade or caps?  Looking for healing factor, marsupial, herbivore, bird bones, speed demon if possible.
---
it is, i‚Äôm level 5 and only have the small stash there are more but idk where they are
---
No the game is a trail as well as the BR mode.
---
And you lose nothing when you die
---
Except your dignity, of course
---
This post sounds like something the Enclave would say.
---
Okay. The XBox One trial is up. Got to the Tricentennial Edition and the prompt to install is there with Gold.
---
To fight at your strongest is the challenge some want and prefer, Survival accomplished that but it‚Äôs much less profitable than Winter right now, so people will be in winter until that changes.
---
I could do that. I wont be home for about another hour. Will that work?
---
One of the guys that's on angryjoes video while they were watching E3 was still not liking the game because of graphics but did try to play again.
---
I never thought the fallout franchise ever focused on graphics so someone telling me they can't enjoy a fallout game because of graphics kinda doesn't make much sense to me.
---
The group I play with dumps them in Flatwoods after we've got through them. To me they aren't worth the weight keeping in my machines as I am constantly at max carry weight.
---
Its still june 10th. Chill out
---
I loved Redeye as a host, but his song selection was weak. But the stories he told were hilarious.
---
From a technical standpoint 76 was far worse at launch. From a narrative standpoint Anthem was and is a far worse mess.
---
Alright, I'll give that a shit when the boys are done with their matches. Thanks for the info :)
---
&gt;It was by far the shittiest release I've ever seen from any online game and I've been through plenty of disastrous MMO day ones. It was definitely near unplayable atleast for me and my friends with rampant connection issues, crashes and quests breaking due to bugs. Good for you for having a different experience though. 
---
Maybe you should've realized that you were only a few cases out of literal millions of players? Idk about you, but I like remembering that my experiences are only that, mine. I've had a *ton* of luck not encountering tons of bugs in 76, but I don't project that bug-free experience onto everyone else like you seem to. "I had this experience with the game so *that's how the game is*." Of *course* there are a lot of bugs, just like *any* Fallout game, [including New Vegas (which people like to conveniently forget).](https://kotaku.com/comprehensive-fallout-new-vegas-patch-will-hopefully-5684137) 
---
&gt;&gt; Again, you're using "unfinished" to mean "I didn't like the state this game released in".
---
&gt;
---
&gt;No, again I'm saying it should have never been allowed to be released in the state it was because it was a fucking mess and a disgrace.
---
That's your opinion. There is absolutely no objective quantifier for when a game is "finished" enough to be released. 
---
&gt;Idk why you are trying to defend this, Bethesda wouldn't be a laughing stock right now if they had just made the game release in a better state.
---
For one thing, I never once said that it was *okay* that Bethesda released a game with a ton of bugs, merely that it happens. Nor did I "defend" them. Why is it always this combative language with these disagreements? Oh no, I'm acknowledging that dev teams are humans who can't possibly fix everything they have to before publisher-imposed deadlines! Second, do you mean Bethesda Softworks or Bethesda Game Studios? Third, "laughing stock" is a bit of a reach. They released *one* subjectively bad game.
---
I dunno, i found it incredibly stupid... like mind numbingly useless. I DO hope though it might appeal to the 10yr olds out there and pull them away from survival mode. That'll be a nice side bonus i guess. I seriously cannot believe i will ever want to play this mode again. If "dumb" had two baby, and then those babies grew up and had inbred babies together, the dumbest one of them would be "nuclear winter mode".
---
Thanks for putting up with the wall of text!  
---
It's understandable, there was about 2 weeks right before survival mode I had my "trading outpost" destroyed every day, one or more times, and glitched into PVP repeatedly, was close to raging out.   
---
But I stayed on course and we have seen massive improvements there.
---
Spot on, breaking through the wall of red tape and SOP's can be harder by an exponential degree, than the required fix, it's maddening but almost unavoidable as companies grow...  
---
Thanks, if we want the prefect wasteland, we have to work together, in game and out
---
The tech is there. Beth developed seasonal changes in a game jam for Skyrim back before it released (but the seasonal changes weren't added- don't know why).
---
Don't know the (optimization) cost of actually running that, though.
---
My friends as I were wondering this as well. My friend is 100% planning on joining the settlers and I plan on doing both the raiders and the settlers but definitely leaning towards the raiders and we were like... well will that flag us as hostile? It's going to be interesting to see if settlements of NPCs will become hostile based on your choices. I am excited about it.
---
Yeah, but I'm thinking since its pvp, they might reset due to balance. Since you get perk cards from lvling up
---
Why dont you just quit already then? Is making constant reddit posts your new end game?
---
The second you start policing what people should consume and what is "good", to your own standards, you just become apart of a deeper social problem. You came into a post about someone stating they are willing to try a game for free after nearly a year of patches and updates and declared they, and others, are stupid. If you think that's banter, you're sorely out of touch lol Nevertheless, you also have a good day!
---
Thank Ye kind stranger.
---
Must be me but I don't get the hype of the Elder Maxson Coat. There are enough other outfits that I prefer over it and it isn't really worth buying the ‚Ç¨10 bundle (or whatever the ‚Ç¨ price is). 
---
I have bought atoms before but an item like this isn't making me interested in buying some more. I would have rather seen some riot gear, even if it was only cosmetic.
---
Its not out yet......
---
Or in New Vegas when you couldn't play without the game crashing.
---
It was my day off... i tought i could play it today... its anoying
---
My wife watches me play and says that I miss a ton of stuff that is red
---
No one can yet
---
I already bought it :)
---
2 girls, one /u/KagoruRhodes
---
We all know how this ends.
---
Unyelding armor. Wait before I talk to you let me hold this gernade
---
Have you at least tried it? I've heard it's actually quite fun. No reason to hard quit a game cause you aren't a fan of a game mode :\
---
Don't insult NW by comparing it to kiddie shit like fortnite, it's much more enjoyable and not for sweaty streamer trash.
---
"Place players right in front of your Vending Machines" is apparently 30 feet away from my entire camp setup... on bare ground nowhere near my vending machines.
---
Also the reticle added for the Fatman is completely useless as it doesn't take projectile arc-trajectory into account. The Fatman fires mini-nukes on an arc, so using the new reticle will result in you nuking your own feet quite a bit of the time.
---
Maybe a quest revolving around someone that hosted a radio station in the vault, helping him/her get a station active
---
And a chance to be overseer.
---
When is it out?
---
Just drop all your stuff to the lowest lvl you can find near a train station. Quit. Unsubscribe for sub. Leave here without saying posting a word.
---
I didnt mean to implicate that it worked, but the effort was made.
---
Use the search function here, plenty of explanations
---
No stay away.
---
Resolute veteran master race. Shame i mostly went for shotguns over heavies but in like 6 levels i will be a walking tank
---
I just started installing the trial right now on Xbox. I found it by looking up the game in the store and it said install on the top of the screen. Now I did just see where Bethesda support said there‚Äôs a delay on when it shows up so it might not be up just yet for everyone. You can try restarting your Xbox to see if that helps but I can‚Äôt guarantee it will.
---
Very interesting. I watched their release showcase and I thought it all felt very genuine. In fact, you could tell most of them were very gunshy when making an announcement and had visible relief when it was well received. I do hope they continue to deliver on this game, as I do love it and have kind of become weirdly attached to my toon within the world, and I would love to continue playing. I am on the fence about a BR style mode (though I do play BR games) so I am interested. Hopefully they mean what they say. :)
---
legend. i just searched it on ps store. I‚Äôll check in a min and if i can‚Äôt find it i‚Äôll post again.
---
&gt;Most other games you pay that for, you can play and beat in a couple weeks and you're done.
---
While true, how many of those reading this expected to get 10 hours of play and be done?
---
How many of those reading this expected to get penalized for pre-ordering the game? (ya beating that same ole' drum. Can't discover already discovered locations....)
---
So ... Nuclear winter is PUBG? Did I get that? I've never played PUBG, so I genuinely don't know if I've used that newfangled slang correctly. All I know is that dang kids need to get off my lawn.
---
73 cards in total.
---
The ancient ones + the new ones for Nuclear Winter.
---
They aren't new cards in PVE.
---
You're awesome.
---
I like how we'll still have the option to play in the original barren wasteland. I kind of liked it like that.
---
legend
---
That's unfortunate that you cannot see the threads of everyone else having fun and somehow realize that instead of finding a Vault-Tec experiment after everyone is dead or rescuing them, you are an active participant in a psychotic experiment.
---
But have fun wherever you land.
---
I‚Äôve spent a total of $20. Once for the tuxedos because I‚Äôm dumb and we got like 3 and a few hats. And this time because I‚Äôm getting a return of 1500
---
He's wanted. Fair game.
---
Even though he's a new level two. Rough but still fair game.
---
Silver lining is he might be an alt of a higher level player and fully knew what he was getting into.
---
It's a good thing it's an optional mode you literally do not have to play for any reason :D
---
Cool story bro, can‚Äôt wait for the sequel.
---
This is 100% an opinion. But it's from someone who's played pretty much every play style. Here's the minimum stat allocation I recommend--&gt;[Build Planner](https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/planner/#AwEABQMEBwcBAQEAGE8D6AEDQAEnAvABA8QBA28FgAEDfgELAzYC2wEDAA==)
---
2 Strength- for bandoiler, if you're using melee I recommend 15 str. I personally play a rifleman with 2 str and bandoiler is the only reduced weight perk I use. If you plan on getting up close and personal with guns, you may want to grab blocker as well.
---
1 Perception- If you plan on using melee and/or heavy guns without vats, you don't need perception or any of it's perks. There's a couple useful perks, most notably glow sight, but they are not necessary for end game. I personally have 15 perception. I recommend at least 13 for a rifleman so you can grab all of the damage perks, tank killer and at least one point into concentrated fire.
---
6 Endurance- Adamant Skeleton and Fireproof are game changers when it comes to defensive perks. A crippled limb makes any bad situation a lot worse. Sure a stimpack can heal it but that still takes a couple of seconds that could otherwise be spent shooting or running away. Fireproof keeps you from killing yourself if you're using weapons the with legendary effect explosive. Explosive is without a doubt the most versitile and sought out legendary effect. There's a good chance you'll be using it if you use any guns at all. If you play pvp you will without a doubt be going up against them. A notable QOL perk is sunkissed but rank two is unnecessary imo.
---
4 Charisma- Lone wander is strong.
---
5 Intelligence- Demolition Expert 5. You're going to want this if you plan on using guns. Like I said before, the explosive legendary effect is op and it's boosted by demolition expert. If you're using stricktly melee, I'd still grab at least 3 intelligence for crafting and durability purposes.
---
7 Agility- Action Boy is huge for any build imo. White knight isn't necessary but it's a great QOL perk because armor can be costly to repair and annoying to have your armor break in the middle of a fight. I recommend taking a rank in adrenaline and gun fu you plan on using VATS.
---
8 Luck- Bloody Mess is necessary if you want max damage. Starched genes is necessary if you use mutations(everyone does). Class freak is a huge help because it takes away the negative effects of your mutations.
---
Yeah that same dude would probably jizz his pants for a pixel graphic jrpg, or remaster of blah blah blah .
---
Welcome Back!
---
It can take some time to populate onto your xbox storefront, but will be available today.
---
You looking for more of a stealth build or just rifle damage in general?
---
Yah, I havent touched it in  months. 
---
Not touching it again especially after the announcements.
---
I remember seeing all those options and chose to clear them all out and had no other face modifications left to remove. I also seen two other new people with the same face as mine thinking they were trial accounts like myself, which is what got me thinking it was to differentiate the people who bought the game and haven't. i'm trying to upload the pic i took of the scars. ( they look like chemical burns ) i've never seen this from fallout 4 either.
---
Yep, really annoying lol
---
Just rifle damage
---
I didnt want npcs at release. But I want them now. Not because I'm changing my mind, but because it's a sensical and exciting way for the world to change. 
---
We came out of vault. Its barren. Creatures fucking shit up. Human npcs would have taken away from the primal survival feel of it.
---
Now that we all essentially beat the story and ironically nuked west Virginia to shit to eliminate threats, it's time for colonies to come in. Perfect way to advance the world!
---
Not sure I will be able to do that.
---
The only significant change today's update has brought for me is overall 50% DPS loss.
---
Pondering what to do next... for now, bed.
---
It's up now on the Store.
---
Lmao that‚Äôs hilarious.
---
Could you do it for me as well? Willing to pay.
---
Sammee!!! I want some new radio stations too!
---
You quit before even trying it when everyone is having a blast, bye kid
---
&gt;and added 73 new Perk Cards, some of which can only be used during Nuclear Winter matches.
---
They could word that better then.
---
Sorry, as I mentioned this was done on my phone, I've been unable to get WiFi to save my life and my plan to reformat using my laptop failed horrifically when I discovered my AirBnB, in LA has DSL (I s*{^ you not) that is so damn slow I could not bring up my GoogleDocs page.  
---
I made the choice to post, as the majority of the NDA expired during the BE3 show, in part because I'm an admitted "squirrel", easily distracted by a new issue/bug/idea/shinney object and was worried that the delay would result in it never seeing the light of day.
---
Can I... visit your basement?

I found it, the ps4 store is so shitty. Had to click on the game and it was under addons.
---
Where is this battle coat, I can't see it in the atomic shop?
---
Here here!!!!!
---
it's working now.
---
You‚Äôre making it sound like you contributed something?? Please detail to me what you have contributed with that pea size brain of yours??
---
Send your location and we'll call an ambulance for you.
---
What apology? He was even blatantly dishonest yet again with his claim that the player base actively chooses to be nice to each other.  
---
Because we all know you can totally kill people with pacifist mode on Adventure, right? Him being disingenuous like this was some grand experiment that happened to work out is nothing new. Fuck, he could have at least apologized on stage for the bag and Nuka-Cola issues. Those were practically layups.
---
Hmm, I dont have a macro program...  hmm.. could do a batch file to rename or move it.  Do you know if the strings folder needs to be moved or renamed?
---
You're probably onto something there.
---
Although I was in a game just now with only 48 people in it üòÇ
---
the only thing you're ever going to use ranged is for scorch beasts and maybe pulling ground mobs to you without having to run to them. possibly you'd use it in nuke zones with power armor but when i ran fists i just switched to a fast 1h or 2h weapon instead of my deathclaw gauntlet. i still did crazy damage using a weapon type i wasnt perked for. between talons and twisted muscles, then glow sighted martial artist and bloody mess you can get a ton of extra melee dmg without even taking a perk specialty. and this is all assuming you arent doing a bloodied build, which would get you a crazy amount more dmg but you have to pick perks specific to that build
---
Still get ESM/ESP mismatch with all my mods taken out as well as no custom ini ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Just saw the datamine for that, and I‚Äôm leaning toward it being something else. Can kinda see a resemblance tho
---
If you're given a Vintage Nukashine drink it on the spot.
---
Correction its litterally just gone live for me.
---
Tell him to do this.
---
Restart xbox.
---
Log back in
---
Search fallout 76 on the store. 
---
Find fallout 76 standard edition on the store.
---
Halfway down the page it will say 
---
"In This Bundle" and have a standalone version of Fallout 76 that is selectable.
---
Select this version then it shpuld now say install.
---
Install game.
---
They said there would be a Prestige system for us Vault Dwellers.  Once you reach Level 50, you can choose to reset your Level and become a Legendary Vault Dweller.  There are also special bonuses you get but they have not shared anything specific yet.  I also wonder if there is a limit to this Prestige system.
---
I can confirm this.
---
Just head to the Xbox store, and it'll be there waiting for download. 65.83 GB though, so it's going to be a several hour-long download.
---
What‚Äôs the point of being the overseer of a bunch of meat piles and junk bags?
---
Thanks for the comment!  
---
I don't want to admit, publicly or otherwise, how much time I have invested in it, and not sure I can sustain it forever, but for now I'll do my part.
---
Idk haven‚Äôt tried it yet or done any research. The perks and everything are different. It‚Äôs a stand alone mode from the game.
---
U using bloodied if so adrenal reaction
---
no because a community is a group of 4 friends, it's 400 people who all share the same gameworld and ruleset
---
No mods are allowed in nuclear winter lol
---
Dopamine
---
You do you man.  I remember when i was 10 aswell, i used to get upset over games too
---
Sorry bud. This aint working here.
---
OMG I love it!    
---
I love the IC (in character) observation of various out of game mechanics.  
---
Just 2 episodes out so far, right?
---
I agree good sir
---
Again, there really is no reason to be a dick about this. Literally all i did was come in here and ask a question.
---
 It‚Äôs in a bundle which is a pretty good deal tbh
---
Added to the new system. 
---
In this new system some are old and some are new and only usable in Nuclear Winter matches.
---
You hit it on the head. It just keeps getting better. Sure there are still bugs and there probably always will be. But people are blind to say that it hasn't changed or gotten any better. It's a fun game - people just didn't want to give it a chance.
---
I can see it now, Insult Bot will take out ads to insult me over the radio so he doesn‚Äôt have to track me down twice a day.
---
I love it that way, so many places to hide
---
I'm lvl 5 overseer. Won twice but idk what I got
---
Other than that is there anything else you‚Äôd change?
---
Your enjoyment of the game will be dependant on how much you let the game push you towards things you might not like doing.
---
Socializing is probably the biggest one.  A lot of the challenges and game structure push you into talking to other players. 
---
I am not a social gamer at all, at least I wasn't before 76.  Now I have a full friend's list and a consistent adventuring partner, all connections made in game through asking players for photo challenge help, or people talking to me about my CAMP.
---
Have fun, make friends, talk to people, ask for help. It really expands this game.
---
How are you getting 101mb/s?
---
I barely ever get 15mb/s.
---
I really hope that we get to see more Rose, either leading these raiders or even trying to start up her own separate faction of raiders if the new arrivals don‚Äôt accept her as their leader.
---
Don‚Äôt make me roll over and  tell your mom what a shit you‚Äôve been.
---
I followed what I saw in other thread, did a hard restart (hold down X on controller and select restart console)... and now have free install option in store
---
you‚Äôre overseer level is going up... once u reach a certain level you can access the office I believe
---
I salute your dedication in this weird niche pursuit. Someone has to have the most sets of PA, and it will evidently be you!
---
How do I equip the battle coat? I bought the bundle

---
haha they almost did.
---
I'm all good now except my throat is still a little itchy lol
---
Worked! Thanks again
---
Tbh my only gripe with BR in general is that winning means nothing and this takes care of that
---
It‚Äôs available now! Just started my install.
---
I normally give them some purified water and if they are are nice I give them genera advice and good luck
---
Except that the host from FO4 wouldn't even be thought about as a twinkle in his great grandfather's eye yet........
---
Lol I just watched that a little while ago.  I was thinking the same thing.  At least Joe was excited with the new stuff.
---
"I can't wait to see how all the haters" 
---
What a weird thing to wait for, if the game is so fun - why are you waiting for people to hate it instead of playing?
---
The game is locked when you are finished downloading. I can't start the trial version.
---
Nuclear Winter is fun as hell! I love it! Already at Rank 4 after about an hour and a half of gameplay, and it is so fun. Just had my best match at third place. Found a late game grenade launcher and wrecked a guy in power armor with it. Was in one of the final circles. Got killed shortly after that, but it was great. 
---
Will definitely looking forward to playing more this week, and can't wait to see how it evolves in the future!
---
Ah, ok. Maybe just specify a bit more when you say that, hmm?
---
What if it is an enemy of the enclave
---
this is a link to the screenshot i took of the scars in question. i cannot remove them at all.
---
You will need to disable any mods or custom ini files to enter into Nuclear Winter.  This has been done to prevent mods and custom files from providing a competitive advantage.
---
This game is and has been objectively awful since launch, polishing a turd comes to mind.  How many people even play now? I'll come back when actual new content comes, but this game is rough as hell for any price.
---
Lmao, I appreciate your good wishes. I remember when I was bitter and hated everyone and everything.  You‚Äôll grow out of it, bud.
---
P2W!
---
Thank you, that's the idea lol. I mean Zeke had to steal the idea of the atom cats from someone, right?
---
I won once currently. I played with randoms almost every round and it was a bit chaotic sometimes but overall I really enjoy thr Battle Royale

---
It's pretty clear that it was intentional since they INCLUDED IT IN THE PATCH NOTES.
---
Don't get me wrong... BR doesn't appeal to me in the slightest.
---
But, if it takes the team-baiting, "PvP even when nobody wants it" players somewhere else? Then I'm all for it.
---
Eh I think it‚Äôs shit myself.
---
The game mechanically and as a whole doesn‚Äôt lend itself to this sort of mode, the combat feels really bad and it‚Äôs just not fun.
---
Tonnes of camping, weapons feel ridiculous when you‚Äôre using them compared to enemies, maps too small with little of interest.
---
Also the load times fucking kill this for me, over 5 minutes to get in to either immediately die or spend half the Match time doing fuck all.
---
I really enjoy Fallout 76 but I might just sell it if they think this is an acceptable game mode.
---
I‚Äôve played some bad BR modes but this one takes the fucking biscuit. Hot trash, not fun in the slightest
---
You have to craft it. Its an overarmor.
---
We got our fast travel mats.. just they are SOO big and require power.
---
You are able to select a perk every time you level up after 50.
---
Are you talking about being able to increase SPECIAL stats after 50 so you can fit more perks?
---
Yeah it will end for everyone, so they can review stats, balance stuff, then release it for good after.
---
Anyone know how to get this? Atoms aren't available in the atom shop on PS4 for me (EU)?
---
and some examples of "Human NPCs have been part of Bethesda's vision for this game all along", because I remember them saying there will be NO npc's at all... never heard them say adding them was part of their vision.
---
Went into adventure mode as-of Lvl 4. and didn't see anything new to build in CAMP. Was curious about the red banner that is listed as a reward
---
We're seeing reports from players that it is now populating stores! :)
---
I couldn‚Äôt figure it out either sadly
---
amazing idea
---
I think I'd like playing with that girl.
---
I like it, it's touch and go.
---
I assume you mean something other then the perk cards?
---
I read there's gonna be a perk to help you find them.
---
**They wish to cure us.**
---
**But I say to you we¬†are the cure! The cure for that infirm, imperfect condition called ‚ÄúHomo sapiens!‚Äù They have their weapons‚Ä¶ we have ours.**
---
**We will strike with a vengeance and a fury that this world has never witnessed! And if any mutants stand in our way, we will use this poison against them!**
---
**We shall go to Scorched Earth, take control of the cure, and destroy its source!**
---
***And then, nothing can stop us!***
---
If you're excited about the npcs then just wait for that. Don't let an optional game mode ruin ths rest of the game for you
---
that was literally the first part of the sentence...
---
I got it, you gotta go to social-&gt;friends-&gt;invite to team, while on the main menu
---
First few gigs usually download at between 101-160mb/s insanely fast then it goes down to around 35-40mb/s for the rest which honestly I‚Äôm still pretty happy with
---
Sort by new next time. Do yourself a favour
---
The lobby is kind of cool though. Lots of stuff to look at and terminals to read.
---
"Thanks for not cutting and running after attempting to scam the player-base on multiple occasions, and partially delivering on making a game that is somewhat playable in the sense that it only crashes sometimes now almost a year after release."  
---
Why would we thank them for doing the basics after charging people $60+ for what was undisputedly broken promises and lies at release? I wouldn't thank a mugger for not mugging me. I wouldn't thank an online retailer for finally sending me a hat I ordered 6 months after the promised shipping date. You treating a company that has openly chose to fuck paying customers over like some old friend is weird.  
---
We owe them absolutely dick. They at least owe the playerbase a functioning game.
---
Is it a camp item?
---
really? shit, my bad.
---
I just one my first match
---
So the bonus coat thing isn't craftable but instead a single item put on the next character you log in as? That seems... Dumb. Hopefully this is not the case. I give zero effs about the repair kits.
---
do a hard restart - hold down X on controller and select restart console... worked for me
---
A list of all the rewards we can get/unlock at each overseer lvl would be nice. I have played 5 rounds and now I am overseer lvl 4, but I am  still not understanding how a few things work in vault 51, since the time before each round was not enough for me, to explore the vault and see all the information there. I have found some terminals, that require a certain overseer lvl to be accessible, but that is all so far.
---
*played red dead redemption instead of both*
---
I'm content
---
I bought it because it makes me feel like this  [https://imgur.com/gallery/iENxT](https://imgur.com/gallery/iENxT)
---
That's probably why it's in pre beta
---
That, is one heck of a collection, well done!
---
Congratulations!
---
I appreciate your opinion
---
I want them to bring back raiders. Scorched just feel like intelligent ghouls. Or ghouls with guns. I think bringing back gunners or raiders would be great.
---
Having too much animals could get really annoying. Might have a few guys role their eyes reading this, but I play Fallout casually and Fortnite competitively, and even in more casual modes having too many NPCs that could potentially distract from fighting real players is properly hellish. They could spawn a bit more but it‚Äôs important to make sure you aren‚Äôt just getting third partied because you‚Äôve got two animals on you at the same time.
---
Completely respect that they‚Äôre two different games but NPCs in BRs has never gone well.
---
Now that's the stuff I don't mind focusing on.  I'm very forgiving with so much, but bugs in 4 that never got fixed should have been priority one. 
---
Modders have fixed tons of issues and I don't know why Bethesda can't use them.  I know mods don't undergo a huge amount of testing, but that can't be the only hold up.  Is it legal? Financial? Most of the modders did this for free, they would probably be open to releasing Bethesda to use it for a small amount of cash, a credit in game, or a stack of hard to get swag.
---
After each round it shows next overseers level rewards. So far it always is one box and one perk card. But I have no idea what is/was in those boxes.
---
What with the focus on cryptids, I wouldn't mind the radio host having a little George Noory to them, a la Coast to Coast AM.
---
Maybe even NPCs calling in to report cryptid sightings so we could go find those mysterious, majestic creatures, and kill them.
---
It is not working for me in Adventure mode. I could careless about Nuclear Winter mode. I welcome the update, just not my cup of tea.
---
1070 and i7-7700, I'm running it fairly smoothly at max settings. Has to be something on your end
---
Thank you very much! Will start the download now!
---
No you favorite it from the atom shop to wear it in nuclear winter. You craft it in standard/survival
---
Alright I've found out what these crates are, they're player icons, not loot boxes or camp storage crates.
---
Adventure mode in vault 51 i guess.
---
P2w imo
---
Strongly disagree, my friend. But to each their own. Thanks for coming out.
---
I'd like a server filter for solo vs team. I shut the fill team option off because I didn't want to ruin it for someone else because I just wanted to feel the mode out and not really play to win. Just wanted to mess with the weapons and perks and see how it works (I like it so far). I did place 7th though doing it solo on my first run which was way better than I expected. You really have to keep quiet and pick your shots so you don't break stealth because that red arrow marker over your head when you're shooting brings all the players down on top of you. I didn't get a chance to get back into it yet after that match but I'm heading back in now.
---
Nice! That is going to be so fun for me since I suck at PVP
---
I'd check now because Beth just tweeted that it is now live for some regions with all others to follow soon.
---
Thanks. That helps.
---
Cool stuff. Nice collection!
---
Kotaku will find a post here about someone who doesn't like the new patch between all the ones posting that they love it:  
---
"People in Reddit hate the new mode and lack of new content" - Kotaku
---
I'd never give up. In Todd I trust üòç
---
I think I'll use Barbarian, Ironclad and Lone Wanderer then.  Thanks dude
---
Careful unless you want to lose karma, this sub with a lot of people who like to kneel. But even now its hard to consider this a $60 game compared to Fallout 4, and no bigger doesn't mean content, wish they just recon this entire game and make it all with NPCs imagine finding Mistress of Mysterys storyline with NPCs and saving the mother or helping the guy who built the lure device for sheep squash.
---
I saw the notification as well, I think it'd just poorly worded and confusing. I also don't really understand how the perks/awards work either, once again to awkward wording.
---
&gt; It does not mean " I am insane and about to kill you".
---
It doesn't?  Damn.  So how am I meant to say that?
---
After each round the game shows a perk card plus a container for the next time you will level up, as rewards. I am overseer lvl 4, but have no idea how and if those containers are awarded. I am kinda clueless right now, what rewards we can get.
---
Thank you for the update! I‚Äôm gonna try and find it now:)
---
Who said you have to pay for it?
---
Very true, I AM playing. But when I'm not playing, and killing time at work, I dont think I am alone in thinking the drama around the game is fascinating. 
---
You obviously agree and have am opinion as well or you wouldnt have commented.
---
You on PC? We could play it together some time
---
Lol.love how someone downvoted you for this. But I think the culprit is the icon above your head when you emote?  Haven't played yet but thats my guess.  I can see that being frustrating.  "Crikey!  There someone with a cartoon thumbs up pop up box in the distance!  Let's get him!"  And you're just like shit I was just happy my teammate gave me ammo now everyone knows where I am.
---
Edit. Fortnite doesn't have an icon display like that. And fortnite is trash. Not even close to BR originator. Just a company good at using kids to get money.
---
Do you even know what that means?
---
Add fallout 76 exe to your nvidia control panel, make sure in your OpenGL settings that your video card is selected.
---
Yea I guess bcs I mentioned fortnite, but what I mean is that if it was easy to do, a game like fortnite that revolves around BR wouldve done it first
---
Yea. I got plenty of perk cards. Idk about the caches. I feel like their should be a lobby for you to figure out all that stuff before it puts you in the game.
---
It‚Äôs actually a bus attached to a hot air ballon lol üòÇ but I hear ya üëç
---
I think the biggest problem with all these "should I play again" posts, is that every single one of them almost are using it as an opportunity to point out that you stopped playing it because you didn't like it. Most of the people here are still playing because they DID like it. Most people already thought it was worth it and that a why they didn't stop playing, so you still may not like it even if the majority of the people tell you that it's worth it and you know that. Since you already own it, it seems odd not to just play it rather than ask a bunch of people with different tastes than you for permission to try it again. No offense.
---
You lose nothing. You gain exp and caps!
---
I think you're mistaking my opinion for crying or whining. I asked the question because I was genuinely curious. 
---
I shared my take on it because that's my take on it. 
---
We have PvP and PvE. I'd love to see even a small dungeon crawl that has got to be done solo. Maybe you drop down a hole, land in a random spot below, and have to trudge around and find your way out. That would be *something* for all the players who love Fallout as a solo game. 
---
Similarly, if the battle royale is winner take all, quite honestly, I'll never win. My hands are pretty crippled and my vision isn't great. I'm not crying over it. Just saying this won't be a good fit for me. I'd love though to be able to explore this area without expecting to be shot moments after I spawn in.
---
Same -xbl
---
He has cooler looking clothes :( he does more damage now :(
---
Crazy part Fallout 4 gets updates once every 3 months(last year every month) at least for Creation Club but none of them can add Lever Action Rifle fix still lol. Checked last week and it was still there.
---
Just switched to low 1440p - 144fps.
---
Ultra 1440p gives me 35-45 fps, nice one. =)
---
It‚Äôs every person for themselves that‚Äôs why u said this
---
I've been playing fallout since 2008, and while fallout 76 isn't really something we wanted, I've enjoyed playing it and its added content. A little gamemode that is completely optional isn't going to ruin all of fallout. Chill and let people get their hands on it before you start going HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHBAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHBAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHBAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHBAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
---
They‚Äôre not your friends loser
---
Can you choose your cosmetic outfits at all?  Would like to have an unstoppables team...
---
Original set. When I mule things in huge bulk and organise my mules I record it for video proof. I'm not getting banned again for some stupid bullshit like "hey we see you drop traded 9000 fuel 6 times" thats 50+ fuel, so you are banned. Excuse me for wanting to use different guns on different character builds and trading in a method that works. Trade menu closes when someone fast travels nearby.
---
Sorry this ended up as a rant. But yeah Bethesda suck at customer support.
---
Not every piece of content needs to be catered to you
---
There's dusins of us‚ù§Ô∏è but go play on the freeway like the big boy you are üòòüëå
---
There arent icons on fortnite when you emote, though?  That's what I imagine the issue is. Animation stays global, ui confirmations need to be team only.
---
It comes ~~with~~  as a bundle: Buy X-many ~~caps~~ atoms get so many extra plus this neat little swagger.
---
People underestimate grenades. MIRV, with 5 stars in explosives, is a bad mofo.
---
The time before each rounds is kinda too short. Havn't been able to explore the whole vault and read all the information that's there yet.
---
I do hope that, for the sake of everyone who enjoys pvp, this is true.
---
I hate that,  but I really want that
---
You have to make sure you save your changes after each update to your character. It's easy to back out of the menu without confirming the change first, which reverts it back.
---
Sounds like it.
---
Yea fortnite has the dance ones, but they also have ones with animation, about half of them are animations and they show to everyone on the map
---
It's a jacket. You won't even win the ladies with it.
---
Exactly. All that coat does is win.
---
But you still helped them! It's just that selling it for caps wasn't QUITE what you had in mind. I'm sure he still appreciated it! Newbies run away from me... :(
---
None, but I would like to be capable off buying it with atoms, as we were promised
---
Why would you jump out of a plane?
---
üëã
---
thanks there. i'll give it another shot.
---
LOL. I can't even kill a radroach without VATS.
---
I agree it's a long wait time though, maybe if there were vendors for skins/cosmetics to look at it would make more sense.
---
Apparently not
---
id like to see the data on that
---
do you out nothin but nukashine in it? Iirc i made 1 nukashine and the rest in the bowl were other beverages.
---
You mean ATOMS.
---
Still doesn't mean you have to pay for it.
---
I‚Äôm flattered.
---
I am in the same boat lol
---
Ok you're not getting it I see why you were downvoted lol üòÇüòÇ
---
Don't avoid Nukashine -- embrace it.  It's a great way to find interesting parts of the map and make a Ulysses like journey through unknown dangers back to home.
---
....Back in my day of 2017 there was this meme called "lets make it a BR game" as the signal that a game dev has ran out of ideas...
---
You have to buy the e3 atom bundle its NOT in the shop
---
This is basically the beta for nuclear winter. It hasn't been release yet. Which toxic streamer do you get your info from?
---
No, played many games already.
---
"Zero effort to make it a deeper RPG"
---
Did you ignore the rest of the showcase? Wastelanders is going to try to do this. Whether it does it well or terribly is yet to be seen, but they *are* putting effort in.
---
Hey, they still haven't given us any skins for the wonderful legendary "drill"....
---
It's a fallout game. If you're already a fan of the series, why do you need more motivation to try it?
---
They mean that if you want it you have to spend money on atoms. You can‚Äôt just use the ones you earned in-game.
---
Yea. I just found out the special from the main game translates so lower level players are definitely at a disadvantage. It feels odd to me to donit that way
---
Can't wait to see you in the wasteland man, hopefully you have a good time and enjoy the game. If you are on xbox I can help you out, just tell me and I can drop you some guns and meds
---
This is awesome, I‚Äôm going to stop being a salty douche about stuff and enjoy going back to being a care bear.
---
Edited because of spelling like a dyslexic monkey.
---
The things I should be doing instead of playing fallout.
---
Yeah ok sure dude I love it and been playing fallout since the first game.
---
So once again..... you admit that you have no idea what you're talking about.
---
Ui confirmations are something completely diff that fallout doesnt have, its a new concept relatively since apex brought it back a few months back
---
It's because everything is static for the most part and set before a match.  
---
There's little variance that has to be handled server-wise, decreasing the overall load. Shit is still a little finicky, but far less than what the servers held together by tape and bubblegum have to deal with on Adventure. The main issue I can see with the BR mode functionality is the increased loading time. If people are willing to put up with the increased loading times and cramped map, it could be a relatively successful mode.
---
Played a few rounds and loved it.  Im sure bugs will continue to be fixed.
---
&gt;I have nothing wrong with homo people
---
We're you in a PUG or have a team of friends?
---
Oh nevermind then. I'm still at work and haven't even updated yet.
---
Won't be bothering with it then.
---
This is a great list, thank you. I am lvl 9 and these are the kind of tips I have been looking for. I would have underestimated Travelling Pharmacy perk.  So far I am using up all of my aid at way too fast of a pace! #alwaysHungry #alwaysThirsty
---
I‚Äôm sat playing the mode and it‚Äôs as unenjoyable as they come
---
I think you missed my point. I'm not planning on playing it. I'm interested though in hearing from others how they feel about it.
---
read the full post not just the title
---
Punch people and emote
---
holy shit, have you ever put in any effort to think about the world of fallout?
---
Doesn‚Äôt mean shit
---
You obviously have bad taste ‚Äòdude‚Äô
---
Well it's not part of the atomic shop so what they said still stands. Can't buy the tricentennial edition extras in there either.
---
Happy Trails to you in Appalachia...
---
not sure exactly what dog this game means, sounds similar to other sayings that mean to talk bad about it, so why would it be a faux pas to talk bad about it at Ars Technica? it sounds like they enjoy talking bad about it
---
Don't post dramatically before leaving. Just leave.
---
Nice!
---
LoL
---
You made your point. Just uninstall it then.
---
To OP: see ya.  
---
Everyone else: let these raging babies get it out now so our community can stay wholesome and pleasant. Partly why our community is awesome now is because of the small minded YouTube sheep listening to the internet instead of forming their own opinion and refusing to play. I see this as a win.
---
 Yeah ok troll... go back to fortnite.
---
Me -&gt;  [https://imgur.com/gallery/eFfmdb3](https://imgur.com/gallery/eFfmdb3)

TIL George Bush plays 76
---
Not stupidly big map, great falloutlike combat, idk what else you were complaining about, but NW is blast. If you dont like it bye
---
I just got a third notification about it. I've received like 5000ish Adventure Mode exp overall from the matches I played, supposedly and about 60 caps.
---
This sounds like it could turn into a wholesome cult. "Come, my children. Let us slay this griefer in The Mire. Forward!"
---
They also secret buffed TSE
---
I demand a radio host for every faction with only one radio station location where we can kill the current one and take it over for our faction! Imagine the fights or then again probably every player will say Responders Radio host is the best and leave it alone and if you disagree bring it on because I ain't listening to patriotic music from the Brotherhood or Heavy Metal from Raiders or worse Enclave classical music.
---
My wife is gonna be pissed when she sees this charge on the credit card bill later this month. She'll live.
---
When levelling up you can pick a Perk Card from a different SPECIAL than you've selected to rank up. I missed out not realizing that until Level 40.
---
Go into the Atom store and unfavourite it
---
I did. "I loved fallout 3 and 4 and the idea of a co-op fallout will always be a cool idea", you already answered your own question. I love the fallout world, this is most definitely a fallout game, and I enjoy playing. Any "motivation" is up to you.
---
Just about to post this, was looking forward to testing it out with the new speeded up Vats, I had assumed a John Wick esq blood bath. But it looks like it's killed it.
---
The game has gotten better and I appreciate Todd's apparently humble attitude, but the launch state (and for several months after) was completely unacceptable. They still need to be held accountable for it so they don't shovel unfinished buggy garbage out as full priced software.
---
Im so afraid of the now 18 people who still support the game. My comments are true no matter how many negative votes happen. It doesnt change the fact they lied out of their asses and screwed over numerous customers of colelctors edition, a quality game, and bottles of alcohol with false advertising. I hope you spent money on the collectors edition and i hope you finally get it, because i dont enjoy people getting so royally fucked like that. Excuse me for wanting better things for people who invest time and money to have an outlet for enjoyment in their life.
---
Don‚Äôt let the door hit you on the way out
---
Well said my freind
---
Stop drinking Monster energy. ;)
---
**Responding in the off chance this is a legit gripe vs another trolling.**     
---
The disclaimer is there as a defense / automatic retort to the countless trolls in this community.  
---
There is a very loud minority that brings nothing constructive, only hate, anger and ill will to nearly everything of a non-hypercritical nature of Bethesda and '76 specifically.  
---
I both won't and can't play the "disprove a negative" or "give us your SSN" level of chicken often resorted to by many of the more aggressive trolls.    
---
Either accept what I've posted based on the quality and character of my post and and comment history or don't, with the understanding misleading the community does nothing but undercut and knee cap any reputation and standing I have,'invalidating everything I've done, and everything I would consider to do in the future.  
---
It's your choice to take a chance on a random, mostly anonymous internet stranger, who unlike many who comment has a history and a reputation, or not.  
---
**Point of order:**   
---
The piece was published from my phone during E3,'immediately following the close of the '76 portion.  
---
Technically I skirted the edge of my NDA as I think it was supposed to wait until the close of the evening, but I didn't want to wait any longer.  
---
The NDA written by Bethesda, was mainly to prevent us from leaking information before they could debut it at BE3, so following the simplistic and reasonable logic train, it only makes sense it would happen during or immediately after the presentation.  
---
My apologies if I do / did come acrossed as egotistical, narcissistic or otherwise self involved, or a "savior".  
---
That is not the intent of the post, nor any other.    
---
I'd hoped the fact I credit the people who bring the issues to light, vs claiming it, by not providing that credit, would reflect that.   
---
If I've failed there you have my apologies.  
---
As for your statement about results, what results would you want shown?
---
Somebody got pwnd methinks.
---
I want a faction led by the guy who does the athletics running test course. I don't care if he's a raider, Brotherhood, waster, junkie...
---
I can‚Äôt hit shit either. People need to stand still more! Dammit.
---
np, good luck out there
---
Played for just about an hour. 
---
While they say the vats bug with flying enemies is fixed, the no damage bug still exists with long range weapons. (Have video of this)
---
Ghouls in white springs are still stuck 8n prone positions while attacking. (Also have video of this)
---
As well as 3 runs on 3 different servers and not a single legendary drop from any of them. Not one. 
---
And the possum badges are still broken and can not be completed. 
---
When are these issues going to be fixed?
---
I can proudly say I have never played Fortnight, I was referring to PUBG lol
---
Ok sorry for the misinterpretation mate, I've been playing it since the servers went up and I'm really enjoying it so far. I always wanted to get into BR but found the fast pace offputting but with 76 it's a nice slow pace and I'm interested in what I can do as I level up and gain more perk cards. Overall it's good, could do with some tweaks but it feels familiar and not like fortnite etc. Try it.
---
If you dont see the free install option in the store, do a hard restart - hold down the X on the controller and select restart console. This worked for me
---
Ah not limited in off time just limited in duration. I work 12 hour shifts at night 2 nights on 2 nights off so I usually only sleep in 4 hour blocks. my circadian rhythm is fubar. so I get sleepy randomly, plus I have family, phone calls, my dog needing to go in and out, tons of interruptions. basically I sometimes only play in a 30 minute block, or sometimes I can get a nice mostly uninterrupted day when everyone is gone and I have the house to myself. no Rhythm or reason my playtime is all over the place. basically for my erratic schedule I have found its better to solo and make the most out of my short burst plays I can. I have messed up on long days by making friends with peeps doing silo runs with them and being nice and relaxed and then they start showing up on short sessions when I just don't have time to fool with them. I pretty much stopped adding people to my friend list because I don't like the commitment, interruptions and obligation on my short days. I'm a show up and be a hero no commitment guy :P I like peeps just not extended relationships, I feel obligated to interact if they're on my friend list so I just keep it clean.
---
the title sadly is misleading and i cannot change it. but i want to know more or less why you stick around more than convincing me to stick around
---
Good take on it. Thanks.
---
Spot on, and technically I skirted the edge as with a clear head the day after I'm pretty sure I should have waited until the close of the evening..
---
You don‚Äôt need cosmetics. It‚Äôs your choice to play it if you want them. No one is forcing you to play br if you want camp decor
---
Spawn locations are handled when the base is generated, indicated by a "technical data" item placed an the ground. This is a teleport marker.
---
This item would be placed on the terrain geometry.
---
You simply would spawn on the ground at the bottom of the clip face. Nowhere near your base.
---
No.. its lame... I tried myself on xbox.. not even a map marker
---
It's great to hear people are enjoying this so far. I can't wait to give this a go... 
---
Also, grats.
---
I wonder if they split up people using controllers and m/k.
---
I got a bounty for stealing from my own supply drop. It was just after a server maintenance so there were maybe 8 people in the server. It took like an hour to find someone to kill me, and only because I tracked them to a workshop defense and goaded them into it.
---
Okay, where's the complaining about the tricentennial gear?
---
You should! I only save that privilege for a special kind of cunt
---
Why do people care so much about the lore?
---
I appreciate the offer but I get some terrible anxiety playing teams games with people. I enjoy stuff like this a lot more playing solo because otherwise I don't relax even if the people on my team are really nice.
---
*sigh* If only it was a bioshock style drill instead of.... that T-T
---
I play on xbox and find a match within seconds of queuing. 
---
Check your NAT settings maybe.
---
Lore? Unfortunately I‚Äôve given up on that aspect of the game completely and now just try and enjoy it for what it is rather than worrying about what it could and should have been.
---
Yeah, they buffed automatic weapons and other types some time ago even, they are great
---
How am I crying?
---
Well it turns out I REALLY SUCK at shooting people. Stand still you mofos!!!
---
Power armor really was never OP in PvP. And no they didn't nerf it. Heavy weapons received a buff a while back iirc. Its still a massive amount of fun and definitely a viable build. Hope this helps!
---
I was just saying
---
Got my camp set up by the bridge next to the overseers camp, feels like the first few days of the game again
---
Vault Tec would like to speak to you.
---
I wave at everyone just to make it clear: I see you, I know you're there, and I'm not interested in anything more than doing my own thing. But I also say hi when people get on elevators. Apparently that's weird, too.
---
Heart emotes are for after I buy something from someone's vendor. If there is a "so long and thanks for the plans" emote, I haven't found it yet.
---
Can I come just to see this because it be great
---
Battle Royale games like Fortnite or Apex Legends has you sky diving/parachuting from a plane or drop ship.
---
You pick your starting location by actually dropping in to said location.
---
My apologies if that's the case, as I mentioned in the comment above,'it was not the intent.  
---
With the assumption this isn't a "trolly" comment, could you specifically point to what came acrossed as overtly egotistical or presented myself as a voice of the community as large?
---
I'll give you that. 
---
A casual player has little to no chance in the beta pvp mode.
---
You're not closing your eyes everytime you pull the trigger are you?
---
You mean like the beta for the game? Because so much changed from beta to the first 3 months of release...
---
Have you forgotten about martial artist?
---
I totally get you, I'm mostly a solo gamer too.
---
Hunger and thirst can be an issue in the early parts of the game for sure. Following the first couple of overseer's camps will help you here. In the longer term, build a camp and make a cookfire. Kill the wildlife and cook the meat. You'll be fine :)
---
EDIT: I'll add hunger and thirst into the list - good call!
---
I have no idea. Wish I knew.
---
Did u see what looked like huge mountains or a wall?
---
i remember saving every 10 minutes because I knew that the game was going to crash if i went into a new cell
---
So was I when I first saw / played with the Alpha of NW.  
---
Here is to hoping we get more positive surprises.
---
Other users are reporting issues with not just this card but VATS in general. As in 'not being able to hit the broad side of a barn' in VATS.
---
Is just hard to get anything across over all the NW noise.
---
So does anyone know how to get x-02 in adventure?
---
I hear ya, the implied obligation could hamper quick plays. I do 12s also. Never done 2 on 2 off. That sounds horrific for a night shift.
---
Where can I find that leveling guide? I might take a peek.
---
Holy shit, you trolls all study from the same chalkboard, don't you?
---
1) Post self-congratulatory, other-insulting opinion.
---
2) tell anyone and everyone that disagrees with you that they are intellectually inferior for daring to disagree with you.
---
3) repeat.
---
it's tired, and transparent, man. Find another way to entertain yourself.
---
1070 TI here + Ryzen 5 2600 with a whole 25fps on low.... Wtf it going on, it's even worse than on release date.
---
Thanks for slogging through the wall of text, here is to
---
Hoping for a consistent and positive step back towards the community..
---
Nope. Idk how to claim NW rewards.
---
Edit: so those rewards are icons in atoms shop. You don't need to go to adventure mode, only to improve your special
---
Sadly no :( Was curious myself but the door's closed and when you jump toward it you get through it only to see rocks :/
---
Aye seemed like it, as well as a massive smoke plume and fog behind it
---
You are ready to go once you redeem your key.
---
In the vault before you deploy bring up the pip boy and act like your leveling up
---
While my experience with people in normal has been mostly positive....
---
Todd clearly has never played survival mode.
---
It's not for Adventure Mode. You want the content, play the proper mode guys.
---
I‚Äôve come in 2 and 3rd place with a team but I have no idea how or how I‚Äôve hit and killed some people üòÇ 
---
Off topic: How can you team up before you go into NW? Am I missing something?
---
But‚Ä¶ but how will I ever get the attention I require if I just... do stuff without telling people about it?
---
The combat is trash though and it always has been? How‚Äôs it
---
Because we‚Äôve followed the franchise for 20 years.
---
Humor. Commentary on all the idiots who called the repair kits P2W. It‚Äôs a sweet jacket. Get over yourself.
---
oh damn,  and here I was excited they were going to work on fixing the combat issues. Guess I'll log in with my melee character to see if they actually got that fixed while I figure out what perk card to swap out on my rifle build.
---
Me 32 and my gf 14 got both 2lvls after one win and about 5loses. Now we are 34 and 16. So it work.
---
Pretty much me also.
---
I‚Äôm hoping for this soon too.
---
You get one for each of the main armors but you have to log in each day, starting today
---
For no reason :D Bethesdadrone.  
---
If it's so good stop wasting time here and go play it, pretty simple.
---
Hands on what exactly? There's nothing in the game apart from maybe 2-3 quest chains.
---
Buff or nerf?
---
Happens sometimes. The tree assets stretch out crazy and it looks like a huge wall and kills the framerate. It tends to go away after a min or 2 tho
---
Oof, you seem really bothered by people asking questions, lol. You should get your priorities in check.
---
***~~Amethyst~~*** ***Rose hated that***
---
I want that blue silver skins for fusion generators
---
You forgot to howl!
---
I am lvl 9, I would have assumed that meant back off, don't touch that bag. Unless it was accompanied by some sort of dance.
---
Yep, super frustrating. I just thought it was fixed settings in the new game mode until I saw this post.
---
Same question I have 
---
 But I have theory so maybe that‚Äôs levels for every character, maybe uve got some low lvl as I have and they are leveling 
---
But I‚Äôm not sure
---
ive only been on NW but yea my sprint and push to talk were reset. was annoying
---
Probably then, yes.
---
If you set a floor mat on the ground and set the plant just right in the corner of the mat, you can then pick up the floor mat and put it inside with the plant. Kinda hard to get it right, but it works.
---
This was really interesting and also gratifying to know that they are listening and even go so far as to bring people in that aren't employees for a play test. Thanks so much for sharing! Also, thank you so much for posting your bug reports, all of us lazy gamers are appreciative (because then we don't have to)!
---
I dont think it's odd to take a little pleasure in watching people eat their own words.
---
In? You can‚Äôt go in.
---
Ive never liked br, and after a good 2 hours I still feel the same. I'll just stick with survival and adventure.
---
...it's pre-beta? Maybe chillax a bit my friend.
---
I would love that mostly since I love blue but dang silver would compliment blue for sure!
---
I'm in bro downloading my free trial
---
Of course there‚Äôs going to be people complaining. I stopped watching YouTube videos because all they ever do is complain and want to sell false negatives for likes and subscribers. I know me personally, I don‚Äôt need to be told how to feel about a game or how to play. If it was just people playing, maybe I‚Äôd watch but rarely is that the case.
---
Nah I know what it said, why on earth would I want to play a game with such a toxic community?
---
It was a typo, I meant to say 'dig'.
---
Wow that's some bs, maybe because it's a sneak peak right now? Hopefully anyway..
---
Possibly.... I was just pointing out that anyone from FO4 is way in the future from FO76. So using the same people they would end up with a different character name due to timeline difference.
---
Same here dude :)
---
Works for me after I updated the custom.ini. 
---
I had to disable better file names, that needs a heavy update, but the rest work fine.
---
Vats broken , been working flawless many weeks , now i cant hit shit even with 32 perception . 
---
Gunfu perk is broken 
---
Way to go Bugthesda üëç
---
Come back when you learn to read
---
I can‚Äôt remimber the name of it but I got it on my industrial water purifier and they have it coming out for the small one and generators
---
Bring back dogmeat
---
Servers seem fine for me, just the settings that got reset
---
I hope you are just baiting. If not, well, good riddance. 
---
Alternative game mode that minimal impact on the rest of the game: ‚ÄúBethesda bad because they hurt my feelings by adding a game mode I don‚Äôt have to play!‚Äù
---
Reasoning like that is why gaming in general is becoming a toxic cesspool. So many people on this subreddit behaving like Bethesda is strong arming them every step of the way to play something that is completely avoidable.
---
Just play Adventure mode if you can‚Äôt be bothered. It is that fucking simple.
---
Wonder why I'm waiting so long.
---
We need a button for new game when we die that's for sure.
---
I'd see that if it was closed beta but I'm willing to bet that since it's open beta with the free trial period it'll carry over.
---
Because it is the only way to communicate with peeps outside your team.
---
I've never personally done it (have a Strix Laptop I boot up for transfer purposes) but I've read about it on here quite a few times.
---
Sounds like you may want to launch one from the Bethesda launcher, launch the second from the desktop/install folder exe
---
bit more work but far safer than dropping a bag and rejoining server or handing off to a rando
---
ü§£
---
This would be amazeballs
---
Oh hope they come up for me soon. I just started playing the game 3 days ago so the addiction is strong!
---
Warm up in tbe boxing ring
---
Just .. mean.
---
the Mistress of Mystery quests are already fantastic and people would be annoyed if they couldn't play them down the line. Would rather expand them and add a new group of NPCs that are reviving the organization.
---
definitely check your settings and everything because I've been doing nuclear winter for like an hour straight on xbox with no issues there has been a little bit of lag occasionally
---
Is Keanu gonna be the next Geraldo?
---
Agree in large part, it's a hopeful step in what we (as a community) think is the right direction.  
---
You are likely right, the majority of this will stay in the '76 Sub, even though I posted the article in the main Fallout sub, because of the hostility many have towards the game and Bethesda as a whole.  
---
I'm told the post over on the Fallout side has had the Mods intervening and deleting countless caustic and unacceptable comments, which is a little sad.  
---
We as a species seem to be stuck in a cycle of wallowing in anger and click bait outrage, I personally have stepped away from every social media platform due to the unavoidable toxicity and I can only hope we move away from the abyss before it consumes our collective souls.
---
He'll want a frosty cold glass of Nukashine?
---
That‚Äôs something you need to answer yourself.
---
That would be so great
---
Yeah thats a shame, my sens and all binds are gone
---
i dont use any string files as they interfere with other mods that i run
---
But PubG didn't invent battle royale either
---
They are randomly in any kind of loot container as far as I can tell, just more likely in better loot. You can go to a train station and use a terminal to search for then
---
Sorry don't follow the reference / understand the comment, but I am a bit fatigued today
---
Not sure about that circular logic.
---
Those damn bags need to be vault Blue or something... they're practically invisible in some terrain.
---
as for the dance, it usually goes like this:
---
jump... back up a bit, look at the ground, strafe in a circle, find the bag finally, shoot at it...
---
...and then pick it all back up because the recipient has run away.
---
Ok now I see it. Thx for sharing the story
---
Same
---
Nope I don‚Äôt have time for people like you goodbye 
---
I‚Äôm 18 btw
---
I wouldn't start over.
---
Plane jumping can look like a gimmick but it gives your squad to anticipate where to land. The way we spawn now is really no different other than removing that ability to maneuver last minute if you notice everyone heading that same direction.
---
And the last loading screen is an advantage for those with better computers/internet since they can start looting quicker
---
Ohhh I need some bacon for lunch!  
---
Thanks for the feedback and for slogging through the wall of poorly formatted text
---
I mean...you see exactly what you get, and you know the price.  What more could we tell you?
---
Have you had long queues? My wait hasn‚Äôt been more than 1 minute max
---
Or just alpha
---
Lol I flat out told my fiancee before she went to work that we are $10 poorer now.
---
I tried a couple rounds, it's not for me.  I do not like pointless PVP or battle royale type games.
---
Imo it seems like a big giant waste of development time and money.  These are the type of games that kids like these days so I don't blame them for trying to fit in.
---
 It is just definitely not for me and I hope it doesn't take away development time and money from the normal game.
---
nukashine for all the newbies!!
---
I don't get the inclusion of the repair kits. 
---
I've got enough improved ones to make that a stupid purchase for me. I want the coat (hopefully its for sale separately? Haven't been on today).
---
Yes some have learned that a buggy laggy engine with less players will defiantly improve with 52 players instead. It doesn‚Äôt take a genius to see how pathetic it is for Bethesda to jump on the br wagon.
---
But I want to spend atoms on slightly different colored parachutes. 
---
Jk
---
True
---
just keep playing what you're already playing.
---
Isn't 1500 atoms $15.00 normally?
---
It will be interesting to see how it works out. A decent chunk of weapons' strengths lie in their AP costs. The Combat and Radium rifles for example are leagues cheaper to use in Vats than the Handmade is. With that ignored, it is Handmade or nothing.
---
I want to see how these new perk cards will compensate Vats allocated special stats with the absence of the mechanic.
---
You really enjoy it but would sell the game over one mode you don't enjoy playing lmao? They announced more quests with npcs and dialogue trees. How are you this upset over a mode you don't have to play?
---
I need to know tooooooo!!!
---
That coat has always been one of my favorite items. To me, for 7.99, it is. But it just depends on what you value in this game. Aesthetics or practicality?
---
Can't have a cashgrab when you are missing the cash part....  Game was such a shitshow at launch, I'd be surprised if they made a profit on it all.
---
Buff
---
You gain a tiny amount of caps for adventure and some xp. Aside from that, I haven‚Äôt noticed any of it being directly linked. No saved up armor or aid,  no cap costs and stuff like that. I‚Äôm not sure what they really plan while ranking up that will be a benefit aside from BR itself but I guess time will tell. Until then, it‚Äôs something different to do when you want to break free of usual tasks.
---
Repair kits not worth is but the other stuff that‚Äôs up to you. It‚Äôs just going to be cosmetic. Repair kits you get from the SBQ are better but I have like 60 I‚Äôve collected and never used any, so that isn‚Äôt to much of a selling point I think
---
Actually you can use vats on the animals/creatures just not on players. Caught me off guard when I accidentally honed in on a mongrel lol
---
Helmeted Cage armor was my favorite
---
Lol at all the "this is just a Fallout 4 mod with no NPCs and is a blatant cash grab" people.
---
I am one of those new players- thanks! I started three days ago and someone came to my camp waved at me and dropped a paper bag with a 10 MM with over 1000 rounds! It‚Äôs helped me a ton. I got tato plants and everything now! 
---
Now I am just trying to get to that ferry vendor for the fertilizer producer haha
---
Anyone know how to get the Xbox version I can't find it anywhere
---
It‚Äôs a sweet jacket but I‚Äôm not paying for atoms
---
https://nukesdragons.com/
---
The leather armor has spikes if you use the brawler mod.
---
bit of an overreaction
---
All mutations?
---
I don't understand - it's a playable mode. In fact, given it's considered pre-beta, shouldn't there be more dialogue (especially from the community) around how to improve it?
---
Y'know..like the purpose of this thread.
---
In the end that chest is icon.
---
Duh...lol you‚Äôre getting $20 worth of a bundle for $8
---
üôÑ
---
so go back there where you're more comfortable. a minor summer game mode addition while they work on NPCs and new quests, who gives a shit? it's not like they are making the entire game a BR mode.
---
I‚Äôm not sure how to judge the effort made on something unless one has an internal perspective really.  I wasn‚Äôt behind the scenes, so I don‚Äôt know.  But I have put a ton of effort into something with a team working tirelessly and had it fall apart.  On the outside it may have looked haphazard, but from the inside it was, (in my situation), an ill-fated set of circumstances that set the wrong ball in motion.  &lt;(has to be a bad joke in there somewhere).  So my best guess/judgement is based on what this same group of people has done before.  If instanced results were dictated by hard work, then that would be a different story.  But the only thing generally indicative of hard work is long-term success.  They have a long track record of making great games that scratch an itch hard to find elsewhere.  And, they have a long track record of launching with bugs in their games.  Is it more likely that they changed entirely who they were and what they were all about, or is it more likely that they tried their best and had more bugs than usual in a project that is different from anything they have done before? I don‚Äôt know...but I have to temper my imagination with what I‚Äôve seen traditionally until that tradition changes.
---
Please do. :) We're good people...not toxic. Mostly just drink, play and bust eachother's balls (or other bits for the ladies)
---
The first couple are perk cards, a photo frame, and skins for your stash box
---
Not to mention it's all free. 
---
Your investment to get entry to the full 76 experience and new content is still only the price you pay for the game.
---
Take Destiny? 120+ US easy just to get the game and full content released
---
That is not how war works.
---
Was pretty cool, I managed to keep the giddy fanboy inside me under control, and only looked star struck once or twice. ;). 
---
But in all seriousness I agree, but it's hard not to read a lack of response/feedback/comment from them as anything "Constructive" when faced with a fathomless and unresponsive Black hole of submissions to the Dev's...  
---
And that I think is what the community saw in Bethesda's silence, ironically enough, and I personally hope this is a step back from isolation, into the light with the community at large
---
lol I'm glad. Yes. We have 23 planned so far that I had already written...but we have 3 season arcs worth of ideas so we'll be going for a while. 2 episodes are up, the 3rd is dropping this weekend once I finish editing. We now have a full cast on board, so we can do a lot more fun stuff. :)
---
I will say I was actually surprised that I enjoyed this mode as much as I did, I can‚Äôt even say that about CoD‚Äôs Blackout.
---
Because time and resources that went to BR could have gone to npcs or keeping the world from opening up into a void and me falling through the flat earth.
---
I had to kill something in adventure mode to get that level up.
---
Thought it wasn't going to be a problem, died quick when I panicked and realized vats didn't work.
---
Main Menu - Social - Invite to Team and then start Nuclear Winter.
---
Hello. I know this post is old. I came to the same conclusion you describe above and have been farming the quest. Do you know if the "signal strength" rewards are levelled? I have only ever got light plans or mod plans from signal strength but have only used low level characters.
---
It's a live game... why not a LIVE DJ? It couldn't cost that much to have an actual Appalachia radio. They could comment on nuke drops, SBQ kills, big survival mode firefights.... Hey, you could even pay caps to advertise your vendor! New caps sink =).
---
I was stuck in aiming, shooting and other things after being resurected by teammates. It is little buggy, but on bethesda standarts this is super smoooth and well done.
---
Notable difference for me on PS4 since launch. 
---
Game runs smoother, I haven't had a crash in weeks, still plenty of content for me to enjoy since I didn't power grind my way through the whole experience.
---
Are you on PC? Maybe your PC is trash.
---
If someone dislikes the game though, their words are true to them and others who don't like the game. I don't particularly like Fortnite, so if I say I don't like it - I won't be eating my own words if other people do like it, because I still don't like it.
---
What do you call stepping out on that stage last night?
---
When I got home and on my PC it was all set to go so maybe you will get lucky, if your PC is on and Bethesda launcher is running at least.
---
***redacted***
---
OP found dead with 3 gunshots wounds in the back of the head, an apparent suicide.
---
Says the guy who has been contradicting himself this entire argument?   
---
Nice try bro, but you're out of your league here.
---
I think needle spine comes from the anglers (u can find plenty of those up the top of the map, just look around abit), and I remember getting Heat flashes from a diseased honey beast during the fasnacht event.
---
With so much foliage, just pretend you are a plant and strike when the walk past you. 
---
Literally works every time
---
About 3 feet away from the barn facing the house, close to the big fan
---
How do we open the boxes we get for leveling up?
---
You are in for a treat when you log in your melee char.
---
I'd know because I logged out not three minutes after seeing what has stealthily happened to melee.
---
Invite to Team never shows for me unless i'm in the same lobby  with the person i want to invite
---
I am a poor Xbox owner! But we shall see!
---
Same.  My camp is built into a tower, so there‚Äôs a very deliberate approach path to take to get the full experience. Now I‚Äôm afraid ‚Äúnext to vendor‚Äù will have people spawning in the back and all my outdoor decor will go unseen. 
---
We had a solution: welcome mats.   Now we have the same drawbacks but with less flexibility.
---
I got around 3 or 4 of the same notification, but no levels in Adventure mode. I'm in the lvl 140's though, and the XP I saw on screen would in no way have levelled me up that many times. I'm pretty sure it specifically said "go into adventure mode to level up", too. Must be a glitched notification.
---
I got to put 1x beer in it before it was killed off and some random drank it - otherwise I've just been giving unsuspecting people NS via drops
---
Thank you very much
---
Yeah, same thing happening to me!
---
Its bugged
---
It's good till July 8th is what I read on Bethesdas website
---
NP, have fun in the wasteland!
---
Its Maxsons Jacket from Fallout 4, its up to you if its worth paying $10 for $15 worth of atoms plus the jacket (fuck the repair kits).
---
What's so mean about a free trip\*
---
*\*in the truest sense of the word*
---
It does, Thanks!
---
Different races would be cool, but SM's would be a challenge due to the animations and weights being different enough to cause issues, maybe ghouls would be doable without much work!   
---
Factions are coming in  Wastelanders per lastnight BE3 presentation.  
---
Flags are hard, custom wise, how would other players see your custom texture?   
---
Agree with the stairs, need more options there.  
---
Yes, the FT thing is killing me, I think Bethesda is afraid of "abuse" of fast travel mats, but it should not hold them back!  
---
What Invis tick?  
---
Agree on SB's been an issue since the beta    
---
Don't know about the Scorched NPC's.  
---
Define help? They appear to have store lines and ways to improve or destroy the WV wasteland..
---
Not in the lobby. We all exited to the main menu. Then build a team there and then start nuclear winter
---
My buddy just picked up the game recently. Took him to beat a SBQ when he was level 7 lol Next we're gonna take him to nuke the burrows.
---
I know it's petty, but I'm playing now and it's just not as enjoyable. Every patch they fuck something or secretly nerf something, but don't worry because we're getting content now that should've been there at release lol.
---
Um, isn't this same in counter strike? Legend of shoting pvp game?
---
You don't bring anything with you in terms of gear.  It's def an even playing field I've only gotten a few matches in so far tho.
---
I have decided to stop giving new people gear. I give it to them we become friends and then I never see them again.
---
Your special points transfer, but your cards do not and you can only have at most 7 cards.
---
Side effect of radiation poisoning.
---
I feel like there's gonna be an influx in Maxon look alikes running around the wastes for a few weeks. Haha
---
I'm guessing y'all missed e3
---
Same on xbox
---
Take all of my upvotes sir
---
Look dude, i agree bethesda fucked this situation up. But you being an asshole to Fallout 76 fans doesn't make you better than them.
---
Who cares? At least they're doing a different take on BR. 
---
What does that matter to you? If it lures in more players, it means we continue to get updates and new content....free.
---
I've never seen such an absurd reason to whine about something. They could have bundled BR into a paid DLC with other content that you wanted.... Then whining would be justified. 
---
You don't have to pay for it. Or play it. So who the fuck cares?
---
Incorrect.  Mods are not *disabled*.  Nuclear Winter (and *only* Nuclear Winter) will boot anyone attempting to enter that mode with active mods.  You may still enter other modes with mods and the mods should work properly.
---
Of course, every patch manages to break at least one mod, as this patch managed to break Perk Loadout Manager.  Thus anyone using it will need to wait for the modder to issue an update.
---
I just renamed the string folder and it was fine.   Just renamed the custom and it was fine.
---
Make Wooby a random event.
---
They fucked it. Knew this patch would break something essential to my build lol.
---
Ah I have no idea how auto updating works on consoles, wish you luck and hope you have fast internet haha. I must say I am impressed so far with the first match I played.
---
Also in the white springs golf course building with the ghouls next to the glowing one / Wendigo on a shelf
---
FYI - your whole team wins, not just you.
---
So everyone has to be in the main menu to be invited?
---
Awesome, he said sarcastically. I was worried when the new combat "features" were announced that this exact thing would happen. Then I was like, oh they won't screw this up...should always go with your first instinct.
---
Isn't the nuka shine content black and red? If so it would be very popular, also sorry if I got colors wrong but forgot what atomic shop items for nuka shine look like besides the free bowl lol.
---
While in the waiting area go to your pipboy and press the level up button, works the same way as in the normal game when it comes to card packs.
---
Been playing this build for about 3 months, it actually feels like I contribute to the SBQ fights.
---
Yeah I agree with this actually, unlike cod or whatever, You can actually carry on playing the game afterwards at your own pace. 
---
Plus if I'm ever going to like a BR it's going to be in the fallout universe.... Nowhere else.
---
Are human npcs really coming to fallout 76?
---
Tow shot as well do you know?
---
That's the only way it worked here
---
True, but Perk Loadout Manager is not working in Adventure Mode or Survival Mode where mods are supposed to be functional, so your comment completely misses the issue lol
---
Hope you're not trying to play Nuclear Winter with aim that bad. -.\^
---
How do you open it/access it
---
Gotcha. I did not know that, makes sense now.  I tend to stay away from games where the only thing to do in the game is shoot each other.
---
 I prefer progression, story, exploring, ect..
---
 I did 2 rounds of this nuclear Winter and decided it was definitely not for me.
---
because its hard to stand by some nuclear waste barrels for 10 seconds, or stand in stream for 1 minute, or...
---
Funny, my two favorite games right now are NMS and FO76 right now. With both I could see the potential to be amazing games but was concerned that the developers would just just drop them and give minimal support or move on due to the backlash and hate. Now both games really are in (I think) a great place. It really makes a difference when the developers interact and listen to the communities.
---
Wow... from the 10th to the 17th. Literally the only week all year I won't be able to play :( Any information on when it'll be avaliable again?
---
Yeah, I still get my John Wick, just need to hit hit VATS after every kill :)
---
I had to remove all mods from my fallout76custom.ini in order to get them back (probably because of a conflict with perk card manager).
---
My daughter bought that power armor just because of that reason. So no your are not alone.
---
Oh the crates are perk cards?
---
Ah okay
---
&gt;I have one and its called brahmin, costs like nothing to repair too.
---
Dude I lol'd way too hard at the mental image of some guy in his C.A.M.P. brutally beating a brahmin, then carefully recording the results, then changing weapons and repeating it all over again.
---
What have they done now? Haha
---
4.68GB, downloading it now actually.
---
Same, but I'm going to keep badgering them about it in the vain hope they dont decide 'lol nvm'
---
Nah I work off mostly wind power, give me a souped up windmill!
---
But I‚Äôd still buy the fusion one because 2 of my characters are still nuclear!
---
About 5 gb
---
Are you seriously comparing AUTO AIM / AIM LOCK to a glass cannon melee build??? Seriously? You can fire off 10 shots before a melee player gets close enough to hit you. How is VATS even remotely comparable to a bloodied build lmao
---
Oh the vault paint job one, I like it too but just wish the would add more items with that paints job especially Fusion Core Generator since a Fusion Core Generator takes same amount of camp budget as a smaller one(could be wrong if it was changed in any recent updates as I have't been checking since light/turret budget was changed).
---
Gatling gun + plasma granates = everything is death.
---
But yeah, with bolt action weapons you gona die.
---
No, you're safe!
---
Understandable. I don't play br games as well. A few rounds of apex or pubg from time to time but nothing too serious. But I will give this a try though.
---
Some old boy totally called this when they announced it last Thursday lol
---
He knew it would break gun fu and he was right.... So if someone can see it happening before it does, but the people testing the game can't see it.....how much trouble are we in üòÇ?
---
It gets better and better.
---
You know the rule....  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNr0WXQ3Ho4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNr0WXQ3Ho4)   
---
 Wouldn't be much of a test dummy if you could kill it.
---
thanks, good to know? but you can only find out after unlocking them so far, right?
---
would love to see an ingame list so I can set goals like "im playing at least like lvl 10 for that sweet PA skin unlock"
---
So, who's the veteran that came up with the name?
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure they said that only your S.P.E.C.I.A.L. and appearance transfer to BR
---
Black with gold detailing.
---
There‚Äôs a lot of luck involved too.

I‚Äôm just glad that there is no way anyone can see how bad I suck at NW!
---
From my understanding yes, seems like you get multiple per level up too. Atleast I haven't found any other thing that would be connected to the crates
---
Randoms

---
I have found that ammo is also a huge pain in the ass. You NEVER have enough of it. I have lost quite a few battles simply because I ran out.
---
Yes, that was the intent. I'm being intentionally an asshole because it's funny. Like I said in my other comment, it's just banter so don't take it personally.
---
Your SPECIAL doesn't affect stats, but it determines which perks you can take. Bloody mess provides 15% damage for example, but requires 9 luck to put on
---
In case you haven't seen it, their patch notes confirmed that the BR mode is instanced version of the forest.
---
Agree. I've played probably 8 or so games tonight. Most times I was killed in 5 minutes by a squad (I'm solo). Others I made it to the small circle but still died. I did have this one mad game where I went nuts with a 50cal though. Its not felt unfair yet either. Nuclear Winter has been a pleasant surprise so far :)
---
Are you able to pick your teammates? I can't see where to invite friends. Or is matchmaking not available yet?
---
please don‚Äôt eat the windogos. they‚Äôve done nothing to you.
---
I understood your comment before you decided to edit it and add all that unnecessary bullshit.
---
Da fuk?
---
Agree and can only hope it's the first step in what the majority of us feel is the right direction.  
---
Bethesda as a whole lost a great deal of my faith over the first 4 months + of '76's launch and existence, and not all is forgiven or forgotten, but as jaded as I am, I won't spike myself and ignore a positive note when it happens.
---
They could always get DiMA to play some smooth jazz or something.  Who knows how old that one is, plus he could easily "forget" that he used to be a host.
---
So how does one get the scortchbeast queen head plan? Since they're fixing it it must be obtained somehow
---
Yeah it‚Äôs awesome I love it.
---
Thanks for the help getting it working for me in adventure mode.
---
They‚Äôve been in the game for a while! You might hold onto it tho- with NPCs they‚Äôve said they‚Äôre bringing in companions so there‚Äôs the chance there might be dogs!
---
I built a bunch of level 1 brotherhood recon rifles and handed them out with some ammo. Gotta fill those ranks hahaha
---
Yep.  Had to rebind all my keys.
---
Gatlin have huge amount of ammo and medium speed of fire. You will kill whole squad with one magazine.
---
I feel your pain
---
What happens when you win a match?
---
ok, going to use my perception build for now.  Then when people get some more info on perk cards switched to luck or str.
---
Really wish they just allowed us to make a separate from zero guy and didnt use anything we had.
---
Yeah. 
---
Except they're atleast doing it differently. 
---
Everyone keeps having this idea that BR is everywhere. 
---
There's maybe a handful of popular BR games. The 2 biggest being apex and fortnite.... Where it's the entire f2p game. Then there's COD. 
---
Then there's a bunch of BR clone trash that no one cares about. 
---
And now Fallout. It's not like Fallout isn't filled with systems and gameplay mechanics that weren't already done to death....
---
It's entire build system using stats is the oldest RPG system in the book.... Didnt hear anyone complaining about that. Or systems that require a certain stat + a roll to determine success? Table tops have been doing that since the 70's.
---
It's BR mode is arguably one of the least done mechanics in the entire franchise.
---
Make an educated guess.
---
What is traditional to leave out of the patch notes and then add as a footnote when no one is looking at the patch notes anymore?
---
Wow I must have missed some amazing and dark responsive based on the whole thread being deleted
---
r/beetlejuicing
---
I sure hope so. Wouldn't mind seeing more friendly super mutants like Grahm but getting to interact with them more than just a chattering vendor.  Be even better of Grahm becomes a quest giving npc or bigger character in Wastelanders.
---
the icon you can access it in atomic shop scroll down it's at the bottom :) next to vault 51 icon
---
Yea bare bones of it they adding battle royale for this dlc season and after this dlc season they adding NPCs that come from outside of WV and you can side with different factions. Also will be a long wait for NPCs though as we barely finished Season 1 Wild Appalachia and now we in Season 2 Nuclear Winter and Season 3 Wastelanders
---
Higher damage then the weapon you have equipped.
---
You are evil Sir!
---
...and i like it!! A lot!!!

this actually worked
---
What dark rabbit hole did this commenter go down?
---
perfect that's what it was------------
---
my cash is ready.
---
I didn‚Äôt even know you could favorite things in there, guess that‚Äôs new with NW. Thanks!
---
Excuse me what the fudge
---
If you use Perk Load Manager, that may be the issue.  This new patch interacts rather catastrophically with it.
---
You don't place camp, you place things you loot. Like wall, guar post, turret,.....
---
Dmg nerf? Stealth nerf?
---
No not that one it‚Äôs the conveys paint skin for the industrial water purifier
---
First company to introduce high-speed rural internet at a decent price is gonna get stinky rich.
---
I can't have +30reload speed for rifles perk because i have only 2perception. So yeah SPECIAL affect your gameplay.
---
Damn... Now i see the cat too. And from now on will ever see it as that. Thx! lol
---
Nothing in Nuclear Winter will negatively affect your adventure mode characters. You will receive exp and caps, that's all.
---
I quit this game because of the unfair advantage people have from duping themselves or trading for duped godly items. This new mode is bringing me back (thought I was only gone for 3 weeks, I expected it to be longer hiatus). Finally, I can log in to the game after work, and not have to spend an hour just farming bullets, aid, etc before I can do PVP in survival against people who cheat anyway.
---
More than that I hope all the employees are getting paid well and looked after and not dealing with toxic crunch culture and demands.
---
Me two
---
What platform are you?
---
Non bloodied it‚Äôs 202.
---
It isn't a trolly comment and you do deserve specifics 
---
"Choosing submit them through the customer service path instead of the Dev's for ticket numbers I spammed them the first two days.
---
This overwhelmed the Customer Support team and ended up with one of their Managers beseeching me to stop, just for a couple days, to allow him to take this to his higher ups to find a new, less "Spammy" Method."
---
Instead of using preset methods you intentionally overwhelmed a system that your fellow players also rely on for help here. I bet it sucked hard if you actually had a problem that day.
---
"Sparing you all the details of the hour long call, I'll just cover what I considered important.
---
To start, I got the impression it wasn't the conversation he expected, and after a strong exchange we got down to business.
---
He asked what I wanted "
---
This sounds egotistical AF to me. We get no details except a "strong" exchange that ends with beth asking what "you" wanted.
---
Like the whole way this is framed is kinda cringe. We do want to know what someone with so much internal influence was telling them as someone who I guess has more sway than the rest of us. Like what are you telling them we want? 
---
"With thousands upon thousands of people reporting issues and having opinions how do they filter the junk and the crazies from the people who (at least in their minds) bring something to the table."
---
Fuck everything about this. Those people are customers just like you. Even if they don't "bring something to the table" their voice is just as valid as yours.
---
"A vocal minority will accuse me of being a "shill", that this post is a work of fiction, or more likely assume this is a star struck fan fluff piece.¬†"
---
Ugh.... More assumptions about the community.
---
You are here posting that you gained more access than the vast majority of us, and yet insult us when you didn't follow the system as it is set and some of us are trying to communicate through the channels provided.  
---
This whole post reads like some story egotistical people I know who say laws are for stupid people while they themselves break the law would tell.
---
There are a ton of people posting postitive criticism and ideas here, in the forums, and in tickets that don't ever even get acknowledgement and yet here you are saying "hey guys if you just blitz their customer service back channels they will fly you out and feed you and dote on all of your opinions."
---
Wow....I had no clue, I thought Bethesda said from the start there would be no human npcs in fallout 76. This will finally make it feel like fallout.
---
For real omg- we almost got like fiber and then they decided our city wasn‚Äôt big enough to make enough money and didn‚Äôt do it - was a sad day
---
Cool.
---
I play melee, and really liked the (furious deathclaw gauntlet with extra claw) until I started carrying too much stuff...now I live in excavator.
---
Kinda miss not using some of the weapons, but have found others that work well for me.
---
After I stopped with the gauntlets, I used a plain cultist dagger and Blade of Bastet for about 25 levels; for the last 25 levels, I've been alternating between a vampire switchblade and The Gutter (a vampire Assaultron blade) for anything other than SBs - those were executioner combat rifle for L50s.  Break out the big stuff for L65 and 80s.
---
Perks:
---
Defense: fireproof, which I believe helps protect you from the SBs sonic attack, and ghoulish (radiation provides slight healing effect). LoneWanderer.
---
Offense: I'll second glowsight, along with incisor (armor penetration) and martial arts (swing speed).  Bloody mess (bonus damage).
---
Nah just mentioned BR mode and NPC's, was short and to the point but somewhat maybe a little positive about the NPC's.
---
They're not loot boxes, it's a stash box skin
---
Bingo.
---
To be fair I didn't stay in long enough to check whether the weapon had been nerfed, or Adrenal Reaction, or Bloodied, or all three.
---
All I know is that my DPS has been pretty much halved.
---
All but herbavore
---
Because the Bloodied build only needs one it to kill me, even when I'm in full Vanguard's with 500+ DR.
---
Ohhhhh thank you so much for telling me
---
Me too! I wanna know so much about Grahm and the other mutants he knew
---
+karma
---
But isn'it hard to read within the small amount of time we are in the vault :/ ?
---
If you plan on doing most challenges (free atom points and mods) or are more focused on being a solo player I would suggest at least 3 charisma for maxed out hard bargain and 5 intelligence for maxed out gunsmith (this will cover other perk cards like maxed hacking and some essential cards for challenges you haven‚Äôt encountered yet. 3 perception as well for lockpocking.
---
Each level after 50 lets you move a skill point or pick another perk card, so once you get those challenges done you can finalize your build.
---
Then again, if you make friends ... we are more than happy to share cards to help out with certain challenges.
---
It wasn't as bad as people pretended even in alpha.
---
Why do "gamers" / most modern consumers feel that purchasing a product means you're in some kind of "relationship" with the provider of said product?  I think we've all been swimming in post-WW2 consumerism and commercials for too long.
---
Not every game that doesn't have a good release is a shoddy fly-by-night conspiracy to swindle you out of your money in exchange for a shit product.  Games as a service like this one **need to be good** for a return on investment.  Noone made the release bad on purpose.
---
When I see gamer outrage, I feel like telling that person that they need a hug from dad, not a games studio or publisher.  Don't buy games at release, it's that simple.  And if you don't want to play a game, don't play a game.
---
I have a dish mounted on my roof.
---
51 DEAD dwellers, 1 ALIVE overseer lol
---
I believe someone said once your back in the vault you do the same as if you were leveling up in adventure.
---
Ok, cool. Thanks!
---
Well balls...thanks for the heads up though.
---
I'm sure the queue times will go down. Keep in mind that they dropped this on a Monday morning when the bulk of the US player base is at work, and the ones who aren't working have to download the 7gig patch.
---
Also, they don't normally do updates on a Monday, so anyone who missed the e3 presentation or isn't on reddit might not even know it's live.
---
I'm going to try it tonight after work, but am not looking forward to it.  I just want the unique plans/recipes you earn in it.  Once done with them, I'm not thinking I'll play it.
---
You have every time you load into the lobby.
---
Seriously idk why some people are so accepting of companies behaving like this. Hold them accountable or its just going to hurt the hobby as a whole
---
Let's get this reply upvoted so that people can know!
---
That makes sense from the patch notes. Thanks!
---
If you aim after the shot it will break vats.. This has for me always been faster then gun fu cause it doesn't switch targets till loot is spawned.
---
So now your free to use your points somewhere else cause its never been faster then doing it yourself.
---
Since you ain't gonna be decked in full top tier legendary items it helps a lot. Perk limitations help too. No vats helps the most.
---
Thanks for the info!! :)
---
Stop acting like you're an autistic hermit and interact with anonymous online people lmao
---
No that‚Äôs for the perk cards. There‚Äôs clearly other crates as rewards just can‚Äôt find out how to get them either.
---
\*Copies his build and is ready to paste link...
---
&gt; not power-gamey 
---
Nevermind, I'll show myself out lol.
---
This is for pc mind you. Controller might hmbe different idk?
---
This is only BR game where people actualy chose to spawn together. Also because people are mostly adult and have slow reflex, everyone have hight chances to survive gunfight. Which is great. I hope there won't be much progamers ruining our experience.
---
No gloves?
---
Is this a tweet from POTUS ?
---
You can premake a team by inviting friends from the main menu.
---
I guess that the game could have been borderline profitable... I remember reports that it sold something like 20% of Fallout 4 sales. And Fallout 4 sold like hot cakes... But the financial damage was done by damaging their reputation. Many people won't buy any Bethesda game now. So that's why I'm glad they've kept their promise and continue developing the game. That's the only way to repair their reputation...
---
its a bug, no fix in sight
---
Nah. The map is very small for the new mode and hardly any entities and npcs and persistent camps and stashes and inventories to track.
---
Hmmm
---
Thanks, I've added glowsight to my build planner and I'm thinking on fireproof
---
So close but even then black is really popular especially on that power armor we had early so it would make a large sack of cash for Bethesda then.
---
This is what i feared üò≠
---
No bugs. After 2 games, jumping the gun a bit.
---
I've literally just read about a game breaking bug with exiting PA and reviving a downed person at the same time as the button is the same for both actions.
---
Combat shotgun seems a little bit OP in close range but i mean, thats what shotguns exist for right?
---
How the heck did you get so high of a level
---
so with this free trial is it possible to make an alt account free with a throwaway then load both games at the same time and mule stuff yourself? i'd love to get all the old junk from my first character onto my new one
---
It was foolish of you to buy fallout for BR.We won't miss your toxicity. Bye.
---
Im not hating on the BR but wouldnt it be better if it was a 26vs26 guild members or factions in a battleground style like wow bgs?
---
I am FACEmunch3r on Xbox. Maybe I‚Äôll see ya around!
---
Here!
---
Yes I just wish I wasn‚Äôt so bad at it.
---
First is picture frame, then icon, and later idk.
---
I know a few people, as I've mentioned avoid, who have reported it working now.  
---
VATS is treated like "hip fire" by the engine, not an aimed shot, and the adjusted mods on the weapon seems to significantly change the success rate.  
---
That said they need to fix the inaccurate percent reporting, it's worse for melee than with 2 shot!
---
I would love that. The ghouls had some of the most interesting story lines in previous games.
---
Actually im not sure if it's just Explosive/Two shot or both
---
you get a good bit of EXP which ranks you up, and more xp/caps for adventure.
---
I might be. Let me know when youre ready. Ill let you know if im still on!
---
Yeah I was thinking it was a blue ish green
---
They really did. I love them all. I want to protect them!
---
You know you can have 5 characters in the game. You could always make a new level 2.
---
Press tab in waiting lobby/vault 51 and it will automatically open a perk card pack itself
---
I literally lived 10 seconds before i died in my first match, i really liked how different the new game mode feels, makes the game fresher.
---
I came back after 6 games and I had leveled up, was exactly where I was when I logged off, and had all my gear, mutations, perks, etc.
---
Theres a terminal in vault 51 about how it was commissioned for the vault for research purposes.
---
Has there ever been a BR game with hostile AI (not to mention frigging nukes)?
---
I've played 7 rounds of the new mode and gone back to adventure mode twice. So far nothing has been effected beside getting EXP from competeing in the mode, I think you get caps too, but I'm at the cap so I dont really know
---
You need briefcase too
---
all NPCs are fake...
---
If they can get to you, sure. But you'll fire 10-20 rounds with your lever action rifle before they're in melee range which is more than enough to kill a bloodied build.
---
It's time for you to learn how to aim by yourself, rather than using the vats aimlock my man
---
BR combat totally different bc it‚Äôs unpredictable. Excited to see where this heads.
---
I'm sorry  but I'm going to have to agree with you. Why are we praising addition of NPCs? It shows how sad the video game community has become...fucking NPCs.... things that are in arguably 95% of games. This is what people were asking from before the game came out. It's not a genius move on their end..
---
It's a start for you. Not us.
---
The signal to noise issue is generally better mitigated by systems designed for it, like reddit. But even threads that rise to the top here rarely get any input from Bethesda unless it is something stupid like fertilizer in a bag left on someones bed.
---
But you just bypassed everything. I think it speaks more about where Bethesda is at with their community communications than about what you did, but it does not leave me with a warm, fuzzy feeling about the whole situation.
---
Not to be a downer, but i suspect in april 2020 most if not all will only be playing cyberpunk. Haha
---
Wait an actuzl stash box skin for adventure mode?
---
The durability thing was part of a patch notes, they mentioned how it had been a mistake. Melee for me is exactly the same so I dont see a nerf
---
Wait you receive caps? Thats awesome!
---
Game wait for everyone to load, before it let you load in. They you are invisible for few sec.
---
No, but you aren't always moving, so as soon as you sit still for a couple seconds that is all it will take. Have you never played a lagging PVP game before?
---
I'm dealing with the same dilemma.  My character is level 56, but I'm leaning towards starting over.
---
Yeah really glas how it turn ed out
---
I thought that was just the extra resistance from being over 100%?  Not the life of equipment?
---
Or just do it the way World of Warcraft has handled it for years, whenever a major game play change occurs you get a free respec. We can keep the old system in place and simply when a major update happens they let us adjust our characters without having to grind 15+ lvls.
---
Go to th social menu in the main menu.
---
It's not my thing, but it seems like they got it mostly right. I played four or five rounds and I think I'm set. It's consistent with the rest of the game, for good or ill. The loading times didn't seem that bad to me. If anything, I wish there was more time in the lobby. As more stuff opens up I'm going to want to explore and read terminals, and I feel kind of rushed as it is. Don't hate the fire ring, either. It made NW feel PVE and PVP in equal measure. The UI is probably the biggest hurdle. I'm just used to my shortcut keys, but I've also been a continuous player since the BETA.
---
My only complaint overall is having to hold down E to revive a teammate for what felt like an eternity while I'm being shot at. I get need for the timer, but it needs to be shorter. I wouldn't be inclined to revive anyone the way it is.
---
Still able to build CAMPs which are the largest cause of lag, due to them requiring every single item to check their X, Y, Z coordinates for each item in the CAMP.
---
Ok the issue you've shown doesn't stop him from shooting and ironically is on your side, and an all to common occurrence.  
---
It's a known issue, and I'm not sure if this is new, or a reintroduced problem, but as I understand it the switch to power armor didn't properly see the "race change"'on your client, hence why there is weird stretching and alignment, I'll try to remember and include this when I remake the "player" bug page
---
Trying to start a new character takes so damn long now. I tried the other day and in 18 hours total time I got to only level 30.
---
Yeah. I am on PS4, so I'll give it a go. Will be fighting months of muscle memory though...
---
It‚Äôs the same thing as just saying the holocaust didn‚Äôt happen. It‚Äôs been established. The people that were there when it happened know it happened. Just changing something to fit your needs is a disrespect to the past.
---
Thanks, you too
---
Maybe now you'll stop listening to all the little kids on YouTube spew their vile opinions.
---
Is it? I mean, I get why it *should*, but I remember Fallout 4 was weird about this because the framerate capped the loading speeds, so you didn't see much benefit off SSD unless you were running the Load Accelerator mod.  I'm not sure if that's something 76 changed, although no such mod exists for it.
---
I haven't and won't..
---
It's pretty boring tbh. For ppl that enjoy "go ham on 51 other people 20 minutes of rushed PvP" then that's great! To me it was just really dull just running from fire and getting killed by a stray bullet or random scorchbeast showing up.
---
Yeah, if they are shit comments. I just went and checked on your history. I can see why you are downvoted all the time, you act like a troll.
---
I use SSD
---
You do know that the entire reason why fallout got popular is it took those old mechanics from books and brought them to the pc in the 90s with a scifi setting right? That was really new back then, fallout 3 brought that into 1st person and innovated again...at least to a point most games weren't willing to go towards at that point in time...now its BR where it will be one of those 'trash clones' you referenced. 
---
However the easier way to refute this argument is to say I don't think a game franchise built upon putting the RP in the G should be making a battleroyal that burns down what little bit of RP was left in the G that is the map of fallout 76.
---
To be fair I did turn off adding myself to a team (as I say, solo player) but I might have to give group play a go tomorrow. You are right about jumping back to Adventure though. Started a new character specifically for NW, finished my last match then switched over to start the Nuka Shine quest. Is it just me or have load times gotten faster?
---
I browse by new, and just double checked. The only ones downvoted are the pointless threads and comments.
---
Enjoy!
---
Edit: moved comment where I meant it to go.
---
I hate the fact we got Shit Royal mode that no one wanted the playerbase is like 98% PVE and we just want more PVE stuff. The rest of the patch is great but can we stop trying to force fo76 to be a PVP game now.
---
Yes, but be sure to look everywhere. My team rolled through a picked clean area except i found 2 unlooted midtier drop boxes in water
---
Arghh stop teasing me with the Helmeted Cage Armor, I have been waiting weeks(months?) for it to release.
---
I just started as well and I‚Äôm enjoying it
---
&gt; also this crate icon pops up in my rewards when I level up as well but I don't know what that is.
---
Someone else mentioned that you have to go into your pipboy and click the level up button to "open them" just like perk packs in normal mode.
---
same
---
but then I wont have all the special points?
---
The map in the trailer for it was just the regular map, you can even see the new river gorge bridge in the trailer which is right over flatwoods.
---
L2p
---
Bethesda removed that weird FPS limitation in patch 3, 4, or 5? I don't remember which, it was well before Wild Appalachia. The game loads about 45 seconds slower on a HDD system vs SSD system in my experience.
---
But yes, you're absolutely correct about F4 as I ran the load accelerator mod myself.
---
No you get a minute to pick your cards before the round.
---
Thanks for this!! Will check out when I‚Äôm off work.
---
Lol i went straight in to gunslinger so after a day your good.
---
I think the ps4 triggers have a shorter pull then xbox so you could get quite fast im sure.
---
I play third person until I know the exact location of any enemy. It seems some guns are more accurate in first person but I can't prove it.
---
Yep. Here's the detailed post if you're interested:  [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/4f9q90xXpnRJ8vlIWVJxVK/fallout-76-nuclear-winter-is-coming](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/4f9q90xXpnRJ8vlIWVJxVK/fallout-76-nuclear-winter-is-coming)
---
I like the ability to change between, neither is too overpowered
---
I know... NPCs... WHAT AN EXCITING NEW FEATURE. HOLY SHIT THEY'RE REINVENTING VIDEO GAMES AS WE KNOW THEM.
---
I'm seriously tired of seeing people fellate Todd Howard with every post.
---
Same here. It was really depressing to find the notes under Dyer chemical.
---
Yeah it made me really sad. Especially after finding the notes about the people talking about leaving and forming a settlement where they would be safe. It hurt that they died that way :(
---
yeah if you run a str build you are boned lol
---
The biggest cause of lag is CAMP's and they showed you can build them in the BR mode. So I doubt the lag will be bearable.
---
I still want to know what is operating Appalachia radio
---
Why do you believe that it should be forced
---
Log out. Restart.
---
Currently at work for 8 hours is there solo duos and quads? Or?
---
Explosives probably need a slight nerf imo. Playing today I got a huge amount of kills from those. All lasers needs a slight decrease in firepower.
---
The issue is that ( from my expierence ) we're getting thrown into different matches. Last time 2 of us got to one server, one got into a different one and 4th player got stuck in main menu. So it looks glitchy rn
---
The problem is the biggest cause of lag is CAMP building due to each single item in the CAMP requiring constant updates of their X,Y,Z coordinates.
---
Sometimes this can also come from, oddly enough, overly enthusiastic developers.   
---
I can speak from personal experience it's very easy to ignore (even willfully) the issues because of the stars you have in your eyes, put there by what you see as a visionary product.  
---
This isn't an excuse, apology for them or a justification, just an observation.   
---
It still means better QA, and a good deal of that can be avoided by using a 3rd party, a "fresh set of eyes" to do the checking, testing and cleaning.
---
OK, thanks for the info, gonna unequip a few cards until it's reliably fixed
---
Yes but they don't require materials to make is what I was saying. You don't get to bring gear / mutations / weapons / armor that give you a real advantage over someone else.
---
Its fun and will be for a week then it will DIE just like survival mode and be a massive waste of time. I get it we got a tiny part of the player base screaming for PVP but the fact they do not bother with survival mode shows battle royal will flop just as hard. Its a PVE game and should do what it is made for online co-op looting and shooting.
---
Leave your server and join a new one, it might spawn properly.
---
And they never said it should. Stop crying about it.
---
I have not played BR yet however it seems the balances from br mode affect survival and PvE too as I usually play PvE. ALL weapon classes are hugely down in power. my 1star furious handmade with 1/3 over repair and no other rifle perks was at like 55ish depending on chems and mutations, now its somewhere around 32. Don't even get me started on my 1 star instagating DCG because that was my baby and with str 15 and full punching perks(nonbloodied build) it went from 290'ish to 190'ish.
---
Quads only.  Hope they open up smaller matches at some point too!
---
This has nothing to do with advantages, this is about the massive lag 52 players will cause on a server that struggles to handle 24 players now.
---
You might just hop in the atom shop and re-select them. This used to happen to me with icons and emotes.
---
Awesome thank you!
---
Will do, thx!
---
Some of the rewards are perk packs for the game mode. Others I think are used in adventure
---
Totally agree. Maybe it‚Äôs just the beta? Solos should be easier for the server to handle so not too sure.
---
We are the vault dwellers. Cant npc ourselves!  Lol. And ya I want overseer to show up. Maybe she'll pop in surprisingly in that update. Maybe shes a super mutant!  Or a synth!  Twisssttssss
---
I'm sure they'll add it eventually. Just remember that this is just a sneak peak.
---
Awesome üòé
---
Fortunately this is a sneak peek week and Bethesda has plenty of time to, hopefully, implement things like this.
---
Scrapping items doesn't affect the budget bar what so ever for me. It's not greyed out like exceeding the budget has done before when my camp duplicated and stored itself several times over. It just doesn't move no matter what I try to scrap. :/
---
I would suggest party boy and whiskey. And pain train if you are planning to use power armor!
---
Oh neat! That's interesting.
---
Gone back and forth a few times now and absolutely no issues.
---
In wouldn't keep weapon artisan on all the time since you only need it when fixing weapons. That should free up those three points for something else in Intel as well.
---
It must be a glitch of some kind. I get no ‚Äújoin‚Äù option like I do on adventure and survival.
---
I think when the vaults open up they need to give us access to the mother of all generators
---
The Vault-tec super-reactor!
---
None of this piddly 100 MW of power.
---
500 MWs BABY!!
---
No idea how, but its a holdover from a bug a few patches back where basically no mod could be attached (you could craft new ones, but not attach loose ones).
---
They fixed it in the next patch, except somehow X-01 helmet mods got overlooked.
---
My second death was to a radium rifle that took half my max health away in seconds, so rad guns could be strong
---
Responding with the assumption this isn't just trolling.  
---
No matter how far they come, or what they publish, there will always be some (and I'm guilty of it as well) that will not be satisfied unless X is abandoned for Y.    
---
This is not exclusive to Bethesda, but part of our nature as humans.  
---
For now I'm going to keep going, and for your sake I hope the studio learns many valuable lessons from '76, making FO5, if and when it comes, a better product as a result.  
---
Because at the end of the day, mistakes and outright failure are required for growth and success.
---
World war z, its relatively new and exclusive to epic store so not as widely known
---
Thanks it worked
---
How do you get briefcase??
---
Why not 6 million? Cause its stupid thats why.
---
That's true. but you asked: " Really wish they just allowed us to make a separate from zero guy and didnt use anything we had. "
---
I've read this twice now on both /r/fo76 and /r/fallout, and I wanted to say thank you for sharing this. Sometimes there's far too much speculation when it comes to things happening behind the curtain with major publishers, and their radio silence (for whatever reasons) compounds perceptions of gross incompetence or negligence. Usually the truth is somewhere between, but posts/stories like this help remind you that the developers are humans working in a corporate structure at the end of the day. 
---
I remain cautiously optimistic that Bethesda can turn F76 into something more people will play and enjoy with friends, and move past the stigma of its really rocky release state half a year ago.
---
Random drop
---
ROFL, so yeah you didn't check my post history, if you did you would have seen I was proving the orange idiot worshipers wrong, until I was banned for not drinking their koolaide.
---
Thanks for proving my point.
---
That specific stat is higher or lower on that item than on the item you are currently using.
---
Those outfits are pretty neato
---
That would be great especially the connectors that give power to everything within range of 5 titles including turrets and can connect to other connectors too!
---
I'm pretty good at all the br games that have come so far and I gotta say this mode really surprised me. its great so far besides the usual clunkiness in 76 when it comes to movement where you get stuck on a pebble when running around.
---
Yeah. They seem to have hidden them good.
---
Whoa, you got away with saying that workshops are PVP zones without being downvoted into oblivion. Well played!
---
Yeah, this sub is so fucking creepy..
---
Raiders would be awesome too
---
Hell no. Most decent VATS builds 1shot anything and anyone.
---
No VATS. Just skill.
---
If there's only one overseer how does that work. Do all four win, or do you, as the last team alive battle it out between yourselves?
---
It was fun for me for about 15 minutes. Then I realized how many issues it has and got really frustrated with how clunky it felt. It has potential but will take too long to fix. Basically like everything else in this game.
---
Are there new trophies/achievements with this update?
---
Is your weapon damage listed lower? Or are you just *feeling* it's lower? Do you have examples?
---
The post is incredibly vague, I'm at work so can't test now but I know my bloodied auto handmade did aro 360 damage before. I will check later if it's changed.
---
Only looking at Strength here with no attention paid to your other SPECIALs: Just get Slugger 1, Expert Slugger 1, and Master Slugger 1 instead of maxing all out. You'll use 3 perk card spots and get +30% two-handed damage versus maxing them all to 3 and using 9 spots for only +60% damage. Use those extra six spots for +3 martial artist for much faster swing speed so you get more hits in (which more than makes up for the 30% lesser damage) and +3 blocker to greatly reduce the damage you receive from melee attacks. Blocker in particular is hugely helpful in Whitesprings with the ghouls crawling at you.
---
EDIT: I'm blind and somehow missed you have Martial Artist. So do level 2 of each card and still add Blocker.
---
Special points still matter though, how fast and long you can run, your over all hp, how much you can carry and hit with melee, those are all special points bonuses with or without cards.
---
Sitting here at work browsing reddit. Counting the minutes until I get off work is more painful than being a little kid on Christmas morning waiting to open presents.
---
It's being asked for on other threads and Wastelands is proof Bethesda is listening to the community so hopefully it will come!
---
It's a camp loot box
---
But the cards require specific special stats right? Or do you mean you can pick your special stats before the round starts too?
---
How do you even have an organized team though?  When I play, I am dumped into a random group of people I don't know.  Is there even a way to team up with friends?  I read somewhere that you can, but how exactly remains unclear to me. 
---
Also, the mode needs for the spawn locations for weapons, etc. to be constantly changing.  We  don't want select spawn locations to guarantee the best weapons and gear every time.
---
Only BR I‚Äôve ever played and I keep dying. Not killed a single person. Have tried 8 times now.
---
Confirmed: renaming the custom ini is enough to get into NW. :)
---
I loved it. It was much better than cats. I'm going to play it again and again.
---
I really want to like the new mode as it will give me something to do between content patches for the normal game.
---
 I just can't get into it. I don't see the point in just going out shooting other players and then starting over and doing it all over again. 
---
  Funny thing is I used to play Call of Duty games religiously and was really really good at it.  I think I just got bored with that type of game and haven't really picked one up since, until trying nuclear Winter today.
---
  I just can't get into a game where the only objective is to shoot other players.  I have 0 interest for that these days. 
---
It a shame because it looks like others are having fun,  I was just unable to find any myself.
---
Hi, I‚Äôm interested in joining the cult.
---
This makes me want to make a Jim Lahey inspired character (RIP Sweet Prince) and walk around with a bunch of Nukashine saying ‚ÄúI am the Nukashine.‚Äù
---
Mine worked just fine... It sounds like packet loss. Make sure your neighbors are downloading porn and try again.
---
PC servers working good in NV USA.
---
&gt;an ill-fated set of circumstances that set the wrong ball in motion
---
That's a really weird way to say you think Fallout 76 was doomed by fate itself, like the development process was as cursed as Romeo and Juliet.
---
I don't get why a lot of people have to do this type of rationalization for F76 , it's okay to admit they fucked up and tried to pad their profit margins. It's okay, you can still like them even after they do horrible fuck ups. I think you're doing demonstrable harm to the gaming industry by doing that, especially with the track record that Bethesda has on fucking over consumers. But that's a different discussion then "I think Bethesda has always acted in the consumers best interest and F76 may have just accidently happened because of reasons"
---
That‚Äôs so good to hear, I really needed the reassurance
---
You're a saint.
---
I haven't won yet but I assume the group just wins.  Overseer is just the leveling system, as you gain overseer ranks you can access more of the vault.  You don't need to win to level up overseer ranks.
---
Ah maybe it‚Äôs because I am a Lowly console player haha
---
Why? Wouldn't you be able to use heavy weapons, shotguns, or melee with a str build?
---
It was not. You never read that in any patch note. You read it somewhere else. The only thing that cane ‚Äúclose‚Äù was ‚ÄúGrognaks Axe can now be repaired to 200%‚Äù.
---
Omg that's awesome. I feel like this would be least frustrating br to lose for some reason. I lost cause i got nuked?  Well shit kudos to that guy for DROPPING A NUKE ON ONE PERSON lolz seems comical. 
---
Battlefields has similar big bomb in their br. But I haaaaaaate it cause it's such a serious and long running game mode. 30 minutes of skill out the window because some lucky kid got 3 of those things to launch.
---
It's certainly unclear, but I still don't think they gave us any reason, based on that release alone, to expect new perk cards in Adventure and Survival yet - although I wouldn't rule out a mechanic like that with the full release.
---
But if we think about how BR works, you need to level the playing field and that likely means a fixed set of perks for everyone to start with that will do you things you need in Nuclear Winter.
---
Just wait for it to come out full time then the sweats well appear
---
you say that, but you are all over the anti-hate groups trying to defend the hate groups.
---
Can you favorite any outfit you want, or just atom shop cosmetics? Ive been running around in my bathrobe since day 1 and I want to keep it that way.
---
Aside from the fact that the time line would be wrong it maybe could work. Have Dog present the raider radio and God for the settlers radio.
---
Bye and blocked.
---
I'm also having server problems on PC here in Ohio, USA
---
Thanks for the reply, it‚Äôs good to hear there‚Äôs been no issues, I feel more reassured now üëç
---
I know right? I don't think it's the best battle royale mode I've played, but it *is* actually a lot of fun, I could see myself playing this for a long while.
---
Me too its like PUBG/FALLOUT whats BETTER?!!
---
So how do I queue with my friends on PS4 for Nuclear Winter? I‚Äôve looked and can‚Äôt figure out how.
---
You are invited to my home, welcome.
---
I hope my tatos are ok.
---
Dunno, its just odd. Very un-dude.
---
We about to reclaim Jerusalem lads
---
Rad rifle dealt 10 times more radiation damage in fallout 4 and it was a really good weapons there. It's good to see this rare weapon back on its glory!
---
I guess all conversation degrades to that level when you decide to be a turd rather than present valid points.
---
Invite them to your squad via the social tab and once your squad is ready just click play and NW
---
Stick to one PS4. üôÉ
---
I‚Äôve only played one match and we won. I got 4 kills and my buddy got 2. The server ran flawlessly and the time to kill is pretty much perfect. Good job Bethesda üëçüèº
---
Honestly with how buggy raider radio is (xbox1), I'd prefer a quest that lets me find a holotape that I can load my own music on too and play that in game.  It would be cool to play any song I own but have it react the same way as radio music does (ie turn down volume when needed and off when listening to holotapes).
---
I have gotten a few mutations as well.  Chameleon heled me win a round solo.
---
Fair point, I had not considered that line of thinking..    
---
Well damn, looking at it that way we are in be "[Why do you beat your wife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loaded_question?wprov=sfsi1)" territory.  
---
There is no valid or acceptable response because it's a no win scenario.
---
Yeah I read the description of the feature in the blog post and knew then it would probably break Gun Fu so wasn't really surprised but you would think that would be something you'd predict and test.
---
I've only ever played pubg besides this, and I was terrible at it. 
---
But I know this map, I know the guns and the combat...and I'm actually doing really well it's a ton of fun for sure
---
Nope, you can pick perks but your SPECIAL is based on your character. I would assume for a new player it's just 1 across the board. You can only have one perk equipped per SPECIAL, but some of them have very high costs, like bloody mess requires 9 luck
---
Yes but I want Ross to have a radio show. Her commentary cracks me up.
---
I mean, I drool over fallout lore as much as the next junkie.. but it‚Äôs fuckin‚Äô fiction, man.
---
ya its one part of the game they haven't yet managed to fuck up (give it time, they will).  just lead with your face and mow stuff down like a murder machine, pretty fun.
---
Fucking thank you!
---
Fantastic, exactly what I was hoping to hear üëç
---
Are all these ps4s on the same network? Could be a bandwith issue or just leave it unplugged for a few minutes and try again
---
I think we eventually unlock the schematics for the new power armor, and some weapon skins
---
Yeah I am pretty pissed they spent all these developer bucks on this without fixing end game pve first. I don't mind the addition of the mode but omg fix your core product first.
---
You have to go to the Social Menu from the Main menu and invite your friends to your team.
---
Are they still in your "stored" tab as part of a blueprint, or anything like that?
---
Gotcha, thanks.
---
Player icon in the atom shop.
---
It's either a player avatar or a vault suit.
---
My squad and I are absolutely loving it. This is what we hoped survival would be and it‚Äôs amazing.
---
Can explain the advantages of +30 on slugger vs 60? It frees up card space I know but he‚Äôs still lacking in damage output
---
Woah there is a huge difference between an in game armor type and a genocide
---
I still pass out gift to higher levels. New neighbors get goodie bags in Appalachia, that‚Äôs just how we do it here.
---
Emote maybe. Or picture
---
Atom shop skins.
---
I want mine to be on fire.
---
Yeah, OG of the plasma weapons.  Love the look and style and looking forward to getting one!
---
There's serums? What did you get?
---
Well considering the Fallout tattoo(s) on one of them, I'm a bit surprised which category they ended up in.
---
That was my concern as well but it doesnt appear to be the case but only played 4 matches
---
Bug: Scout Leader Pompy isn't giving me the toxic waste daily. Tried with two different characters.
---
We heard the Overseer talk in the trailer so she is still alive. Maybe she is helping the settlers come back to Appalachia. And she can finally tell us how disappointed she is that we blew it to hell.
---
I had a similar problem and they said they are looking at it
---

---
I believe it‚Äôs only purchasable with the E3 special atom pack
---
They got meds for that ( grape mentats+ excel) and I sell a ton out of my vend
---
It's intentional that it's not working in Nuclear Winter Mode, but they still allow them in the Adventure and Survival modes.
---
They did give us a "gift" emote. It's worked well for me so far
---
There is a lesson here about online games and guides
---
Got it. Thanks!
---
The game is great for the most part. The biggest issue I have is when a bug is so blatant and everywhere it makes me wonder if real testing was used. For example most everyone for the last two weeks get stuck when traveling to camps with vending. It‚Äôs not even uncommon. So that makes me upset when they obviously saw that and didn‚Äôt mention it or just didn‚Äôt even test that.
---
I had a similar post and they said they are looking at it
---
Try enabling uPnP on your router. I know its an issue for xbox.
---
Np :)
---
I find it ends up with a trade invite, which I back out of... and 3/5 players end up just running away right away.
---
Woah really? They were already stupid expensive
---
Yeah, my thoughts exactly. I don't have the budget for more plushies, but I can't not buy them.
---
Nope, only issue is having to toggle mods on/off which means exiting the game entirely.
---
Indeed, it could even affect NDA for Bethesda to confirm this is a thing and bring pressure from others wanting to join. You haven't said anything they need to damage control and not hinted to anything they need to get on top of to stop misinformation so if anything you can probably take this staying up as proof of validation as best as can get. 
---
But as this isn't a new concept it isn't outright unbelievable. Ubisoft has invited noteworthy community members to meet them on the idea of fixing and building for the community for example.
---
Yes until I deleted my Mothman neon billboards. The neon billboards are the problem.
---
It should be a new stash, not an actual lootbox.
---
I've been in survival a ton and I've never had anyone damage my camp - I even have active vendors at it.
---
patch notes probably contain the info you require..
---
Im terribly sorry I dont have any links
---
As I said above, add +3 martial artist which means he's getting way more swings in with his melee weapon. That by itself more than makes up the difference between 30% and 60% damage. 3 or 4 hits at 30% is better than 1 at 60%. And then add +3 blocker because that way lessens the melee damage he'll be taking while swinging his weapon of choice.
---
Thanks. I know it was still going to be a while. Was just wondering if it was still planned or if they were going to play "Pretend we didn't say that"
---
Have you actually bought the plan yet from the Enclave vendor for some 5,000+ caps?  The bug is that it shows in your crafting menu even if you have not read it.  I fixed this problem by buying and reading the plan.  I've applied this mod over a dozen times with no issues now.
---
You all have to be at main menu , invite them and you can load in to winter after they joined
---
I honestly do both, but it doesnt hurt to go bak to high level just to fuck around and farm shit for ur vendor.  Honestly now that you've already played most of it you can just take your time with new toons.  Or try new toon on survival mode.
---
I saw in another thread that someone said these are actually skins for your Stash - maybe check that?
---
The reason why survival mode is dying is because of cheaters. Everybody running around in stealth with full Assassin‚Äôs, Sentinel, Powered, Cavalier, Chameleon, etc. Armor and Bloodied explosive Handmades locking on with VATs  trying to fill a hole in their soul with cheap victories.
---
These are the people that existed before the fallout PvP community so take that for what it is. A lot of people that played Fallout before 76 were literally in their own little world convinced that they were the best and when 76 dropped they stopped at nothing to cheat themselves and the community in attempt to prove that almost destroying the entire fucking game.
---
Not till this afternoon
---
Step 1: Post on Reddit
---
Step 2: ????
---
Step 3: PROFIT
---
Are you talking about yourself
---
Because of meetings, priority lists, documentation requirements, mandatory reporting etc..  
---
Professionally I've had fixes that took a week plus of meetings to approve, 90 minutes of "day of" prep, a bridge call during the process and documentation requirements that took 30 minutes to fix, all to do a 90 second fix, provided by the company who manufactured the software on question, run as a self installing executable.  
---
In short the red tape results in taking a 90 second fix and multiples the time and effort required by an exponential degree, which is one of the more maddening side effects of   bureaucracy
---
I wish this was true haha but i have experienced some types of lags and bug/glitches (ONE JUST RIGHT NOW) - where i was doing a emote in vault 51 and my character got stuck doing the emote even when i respawned in the game( battle royale mode)  and in the morning it was just a bit buggy and crashed on me . ( im on PS4 )
---
Who knows what perks there are.  But melee is rare to melee.  Its mostly guns so far.
---
No I outright just deleted 6 different lights and got none of the camp budget back and I wanna place my Mr. Pebbles stuff I got from the atom shop.
---
Hi! Thank you for your report. The recent update that causes VATS to close immediately after killing an enemy is not intended to affect Gun Fu. We're currently looking to address this in our next update.
---
I am the chosen one.
---
Did about a half dozen hops after the update and I really don‚Äôt feel like I was consistently hitting any closer to vending machines, but OTOH, I have yet to materialize inside a foundation today, so maybe better...?
---
That must be a pain, I‚Äôm on console  so I‚Äôve never had the luxury of the perk loadout mods etc but must be annoying if your on PC
---
You could probably do well either way since you have a character that's 50+ with an established build. But personally I would start over and experience everything anew.
---
it's quads but i read you can disable team filling or something and play alone or in a duo, but of course then it's harder to win
---
The isotope serum
---
Hey I got the perfect 3* war drum so I appreciate it
---
That was it. Haha weird...

Nothin, it‚Äôs XP like player XP

For sure - I'm not letting this bad boy go unless someones willing to finance Signs &amp; Letters in exchange for the collectors item.

It's a shame we don't have decorating capabilities. I'd put it in the museum I've been planning for when it drops.
---
Ok, but releasing a fallout game, without any sort of dialogue or character choice, was wack.

Need to find the briefcase and use it in your pipboy.
---
I knew that was coming, thanks for the heads up.
---
Aaaaaand.... thank you !
---
Questioning  people, especially random internet strangers, is key to a healthy and stable existence, don't stop, but thank you for understanding it can be both simpler and more complicated than initially thought.
---
I was specifically talking about bots in response to the dude above claiming its all bots like a crazy conspiracy theorist does.
---
Naked ~~Thurs~~everydays
---
If I‚Äôm not mistaken he has martial artist.
---
It really is, I can't wait to unlock the others. I just played pretty much nonstop until halfway through overseer rank 5, I need to take a bit of a break
---
I've thoroughly enjoyed the road so far, and from an immersion standpoint, it feels truly like a Wasteland experience, spending so long being among the first and only adventurers to journey out. Now it will feel like others (NPCs, Raiders) have observed our triumphant reclamation of New Virginia &amp; seek to impede our progress.
---
I really like durability in fo4 engine funnily enough coz I disliked it in 3 and nv.  But I guess it's nice that I dony have to worry about repairing but what di we do with random junk now outside of crafting?
---
It doesn't really take more time that it used to - if you're only interested in leveling best to find a place to grind a lot of XP like West Tek server hopping or Whitesprings Golfcourse etc :)
---
Is that just another random loot you find in the loot boxes?
---
I loved this weapon in Fallout 2 and I really hope they add it in the game.
---
Haha funny enough, I meant to switch to my alt on the first run, but I forgot to confirm it. Didn't realize until the end, was damn happy everything was still there!
---
If you have ever played Garry‚Äôs Mod in an RP server, they sometimes have a radio room where you can set up your own station.
---
Basically, whatever you put through your mic will end up playing as a broadcast through little radios each of the other players can place down.
---
There is a way to link youtube videos right into the game and it would play the audio.
---
It would be awesome if they had something like that, where the radio host would be a player on the mic!
---
Maybe they have a preset music cycle (or can choose any song in the game to play next), however they get to say what they want during the commercial breaks. 
---
Of course it could get out of hand fast but it would make for an amazing experience!
---
People could take it upon themselves to even pay to have their camp shops talked about like an advertisement! 
---
Idk i know Im going off but it was a cool thought I think lol
---
You unlock areas of Vault 51 that give you rewards when you meet lvl 10, lvl 30, etc...
---
Wait when did he apologies ? I don't remember him doing so.
---
Same this game went from borderline unplayable to the majority of bugs fixed and more content shelled out than most games. With Nuclear Winter and Wastelanders seemingly dropping before year 1 is over, I feel this game did a crazy 180.
---
It deserves to be reevaluated. And Bethesda needs to gain a little respect back. They tried something new it fell on its face but they kept at it.
---
&gt;Never have I had a friend go out and get undeservedly eviscerated by the public personally and professionally
---
Professionally, him specifically, it was 100% percent deserved. This isn't the Devs fault, no one here believes that. What we do believe is Bethesda at the corporate level made egregious decisions and the devs probably made lemonade out of a bucket of pine cones. Very strange you personally feel this way about Todd. This game is beautiful and has/had the potential to be the best FO game yet. But that doesn't have a damn thing to do with Todd. The dudes got that politician PC bullshit thing going on I just know it when I see it.
---
To each their own :D
---
I personally think the gunplay feels better in Fortnite, but I don't really play that much anymore.
---
Yeah. I‚Äôm not getting stuck but I‚Äôm not any closer to the vending.
---
Oh geez, I'm blind. Well, then do each slugger to 2 and still add Blocker level 3. It's crazy useful for melee.
---
As you get more overseer xp you unlock more rewards, the power armor is somewhere up there :)
---
Cool thanks.
---
Brother/sister (idk) I have the same story! Welcome aboard!
---
Search Fallout 76 Roadmap and it will tell you just about everything added
---
Thanks for the info. Do we know what these rewards are yet?
---
team up on main menu first then hit play with team
---
I‚Äôll get them into my raider gang &gt;:)
---
I seldom use Vats with most of my weapons, but, I have an Instigating Explosive, vats fills 15% faster Lever Action that stacks a Crit every 3rd Shot, so why would I not take advantage of that +40% damage bonus, 
---
Would you want your BE rifle nerfed in PVP? 
---
My point is that players are always asking to have something they're not using nerfed, while they are getting huge damage bonus from something else. 
---
The game mechanics and balance are such that any good build can kill any other player with the right strategy, and nobody is invincible, but the ones that are used to playing in God mode, or were previously taking advantage of a nearly invincible armor configuration are now whining because other players can kill them.
---
I consider myself above average at PVP, but I still get killed (65% win vs 35% lose), I'm also someone that played previous FO versions in Hardcore mode, but there seems to be a lot of players in this game looking for an easy button, and complaining when it doesn't work their way.
---
*DUMBO* dont you remember the 300 dead valt dwellers you have looted
---
Sell it. Share it.
---
Look, if that's what they want to accomplish, fine. But it wasn't communicated. "Durability of items will be lowered to allow for more use of junk" or something. Thats all is needed.  I understand balance. Doing it secretly?  I dont understand. Its shady and doesn't show trust.
---
*:)*
---
It absolutely does. Ghouls and BGO xp were halved as was the spawn rate and xp from monster mash.
---
A new game mode like how we have adventure and survival? Year one, year two, etc
---
the special bundle should be there, on xbox it was at the far right.
---
Quads is actually kind of fun, it‚Äôs really cool to plan out stuff with other people.
---
I liked the lore. But your analogy is a non-sense. The armor is included in the lore in a acceptable way as a prototype for vault 51 in a terminal inside. Comparing this with the Holocaust is edgy.
---
Ok, thanks!
---
REX NEW VEGAS
---
I've only been playing it solo so far, wish any of my friends played xD
---
Dumbo is an elephant.
---
ALSO YES
---
Not true for me. It just waited until the last possible second to open the map while I was both sleeping and playing an instrument. It was totally worth it for the chance to finally hear six different people playing instruments at the same time.
---
So far all I‚Äôve seen for example is the displayed Brotherhood armor skin that‚Äôs in the vault, but besides that I‚Äôm unaware of the awards behind those areas
---
does in work angainst player in stealth?
---
Indubitably
---
Why did you buy the game if there is a free trial week? I think you messed up and are trying to blame Bethesda for it. Sorry dude, cant blame everyone else for your choices, not how life works.
---
I need to find out what's behind those lasers lol.
---
It's still pretty bad in terms of server stability and crashing.

---
An article here I've finally found sheds some light and a small workaround for the glitch I'm experiencing.
---
It said I got 3 or 4 levels as I played but when I went to get them I had no exp.
---
Is that your opinion, or based on fact, coz I see a lot of people enjoying this mode right now
---
Thanks for the heads up. Glad they acknowledged you so fast.
---
You'll just have to find new things to do then. I got a character to level 57 in just a couple of days playing for a few hours after work :)
---
Its a charming type of pity that can't quite be explained
---
Yeah not true for me, I was just playing the banjo and the map opened for me
---
And, this is NOT the kind of game one plays looking for a "finish". I think that aspect throws some people off because when they realize that there's no finale, no grand cut scene at the end they leave and trash talk it. I love that this game is what you make of it and that it gets the DLC'S
---
.
---
The only complaint I have is that the game mode doesn‚Äôt know what it wants to be. Like the ring of fire moves fast but the gameplay wants you to build a base and hold down an area, it‚Äôs kind of weird.
---
Quick pedantic question, why do you guys say "thru July 8th"? Bethesda does it with the update timeframes as well. Through = in &amp; out, before &amp; after, on one side and the other while having passed through the thing. What's wrong with "until"?
---
They seem to be in regular containers and loot boxes. Not sure how to find 4 in one session though.
---
Yes, it seems endurance and perception will be key. May have to reroll since i used endurance as a dump stat
---
That is the most ominous smiley I have ever seen.
---
I feel like early game power leveling would be great to do in BR until it was easier to just grind mobs
---
Beth if you see this I want you to know this is all lit. This is exactly what I wanted. I've got 1,600 atoms but as soon as I get home I'm getting that new bundle too. Guy's I'm so hyped about NW things are getting better!
---
# WHEN CAN THEY TAKE MY MONEY
---
because them owning up that they were at fault is good enough, it shows growth, it also takes a lot to say they were wrong on stage at the biggest gaming event of the year.
---
*disappointment*
---
Were is my snow it is nuclear winter so where is my tundra?
---
I mean that is FO76 every few hours right now.
---
Italics
---
*I LOVE ME A GOOD SPLOSHION :)*
---
NP I hadn't noticed that pistols worked. I only tested rifles.
---
I cannot explain the old magic, I was not there when it was written.
---
Is that pack only purchasable at E3 or can one purchase it online?
---
&gt;Now I am just trying to get to that ferry vendor for the fertilizer producer haha
---
Just fast travel to player vendors that show lots of plans available. The one you want is called brahmin pen, and it's super common, so you should be able to buy one for less than the robot vendor charges.
---
If you're on xbox I have a couple. Send me your GT and I'll give you one for free.
---
I've got over 400 levels between characters. Some of them are mules. 
---
I've worked out ways to level quickly
---
you invite them to a team on the main menu
---
There has to be a reason to play one story mode over the other. I imagine people will just play Wastelanders otherwise.
---
Lvl 5 will reward you with the option of building a small nuclear winter container in your camp back in adventure or survival mode. The container will work as a stash box. Regarding the rewards for the previous lvls it seems that we get an player icon and a photo frame. At least thats what others have stated.
---
Is it worth playing if you absolutely suck at BR games and are guaranteed to be last place each time?
---
You do need ps plus
---
Not when you have Momma Dolches and Canned dog food.
---
Add them in team at the main menu, I would assume. Haven't tried it yet.
---
"everyone who disagrees with me is a sheep who can't form their own opinions, so lets be glad they are leaving so we can have an echo chamber with no opposing opinions" 
---
lol ok bud
---
Good on you for giving it the old college try though. I've never really been into BR, but am going to give this a shot as well. Might end up liking it, might stick to Adventure.
---
Well i'm also enjoying it. It turned out to be better than a lot other battle royale games and what i was hoping.
---
Yeah, I was almost tempted to buy a Bloodied Fat Man a few minutes ago when I saw it was doing 4800 damage with my current build.
---
Nice. So do I just scroll over someone else camp and it will show me there is plans? Thanks for the tip I really appreciate it. I walked all the way over to it and can‚Äôt get in without being tore apart by zombies. I‚Äôm level 6. Haha
---
Ok I will pm you my psn id
---
Never actually seen the mod for sale at the war room vendor, probably checked for at least a month.  Never ever seen an X-01 mod in the wild before either.  The mod is worth the caps and doesn't require flux like it does for the other PA sets.
---
People are still playing this dumbshit game? lol
---
Yes, after a couple of server hops (which shoouldn't be the way to get it)
---
It has red circle next to name. How do I get that off?
---
Actually bethesda can technically just take their mods and code since they own it already
---
That was it TY
---
I love this! And I'm glad they didn't too! The best part for me would be hands down getting to play this with my husband! Plus the small group of people that we fight end game enemies with every Saturday all day are awesome! 
---
Honestly, besides a few bad eggs I've come across in game, the community as a whole is awesome!
---
I love how you can get stuff pve players cant just enjoying pve. Reminds me a lot of wow pve and pvp sets
---
I will legit spend atoms on skins for my legendary shovel.
---
But good PvP design puts mechanical skill over statistical advantage always, because otherwise it doesn't reward skill, and isn't interesting to most people who enjoy PvP.
---
What?
---
They didnt have to admit they were wrong is was extremely obvious to literally everybody. The world was talking about how screwed the game was at launch.
---
Its great that they said it but it doesnt excuse the amount of shit they shoveled
---
Ooooo I like that idea!  ECHO ECHo ECho Echo echo.  
---
Fo real, tho - majority of people who "hate" this game repeat the same things over and over that arent true. Like no content. World is "dead".  And the such. I speak truth in my chamber of echoes.
---
I got 3539 on it, at full health lol. I think since ts is back to it's x2 damage output you can aswell use those again for those not into bloodied builds
---
Are nuke winter rewards account wide like purchases in atom shop; or character specific? I ask cause few people have perception and endurance builds which i think will be key in nuke winter
---
This is a continuation of the main story, not a separate mode.
---
whats better for pvp, targeting HUD or recon?
---
They only one I can tell from the others really is the X01 because it looks like an alien.
---
They really ought to. It would be amazing to get at least 3 'year's of content updates at the very least. But hopefully more meaty stuff than a simple medium-sized sewer system with a 'quest' and more pvp stuff.
---
Where does it say they changed them back
---
Havent tested the idea yet, but id imagine having a clean (no mods) second copy of fallout76custom.ini and just renaming between launches would work.
---
Yeah i went up to rank 4 and stopped for a while. I like it tho.
---
I noticed that. It moves waaaay fast and killed me instantly.
---
you'll see when you get too many ranks hah
---
&gt; Both the Gamer and the Studio/Dev/whatever want that relationship. They literally just stood on stage at E3 and told us how they've heard us. hey release patches monthly based on our feedback. Online gaming in the modern day is a relationship for some games.
---
This is called "marketing bullshit" and it's been around since the dawn of man.
---
Can you explain a little bit more in detail? Remove all mods, load the game, enable the mods again and you are set? Or is the perk loadout manager not working anymore?
---
Those are the numbers, and they seem to be pretty solid as to what I've seen them doing with sb's ect
---
Does this work better for pvp against stealth players?
---
Their article did mention companions but we  don't know how it's gonna work yet. But by god I better be able to get a ghoul companion.
---
Sure Todd.
---
There's an unmarked Vault in the most northwestern corner of the map. That's possibly the vault the raiders are coming from given the close proximity to the crashed space station. I might have to check it out again and see if they added the number to the vault door or if it's still a purple box.
---
Thank you, I have it downloading and by the time I'm home from work, hopefully it is completed.  Do we know if trophies are working during the trial or do we have to start a new character once we buy the proper game?
---
Thanks for the report. We'll look into it!
---
This is good news. As such I wonder why it wasn't in any patch notes?
---
'True' explosive weapons were long overdue a buff. Like even before they 'reworked' demo expert.
---
Have they also 'tweaked' the durability? I had a TS Rocket Launcher that you could see it losing condition as you fired.
---
Welcome!
---
Thanks for this!! It was there on my second attempt and I farmed the shit out of it lol
---
It reminds me of a centaur from fallout 3, but taller.
---
Also I rather have a tiny death claw *:)*
---
Didn't really look at it as of now, needed a sbq to do so, everything else dies after a few shots, but for me they wouldn't even need that in exchange for these insane damage numbers
---
Several quests, two high level dungeons, brewing system, lots of qol stuff (double stash size, weapon balancing, etc), a scouting quest line, ledgendry trader...
---
The biggest thing is likely player vending, which puts player camps on the map,so you can visit prior and see what they've built.
---
Is important to note that npcs are coming in an upcoming dlc. They aren't here yet.
---
Never wanted a pvp in the first place due to it being a fallout game. Now they release a fortnite rip off...great..
---
Wow im going to have to try that!
---
Check the trailers for Wastelanders and Nuclear Winter on YouTube, outside of the echochamber. Wastelanders is decently well received while Nuclear Winter is more than 50% negative reactions. They just don't know their audience, and I'm not going to pretend they do because maybe a little bit of the shit they are throwing at the wall lands near where I want it.
---
I will never understand why people like these unimmersive, childish and ridiculous skins.
---
Same experience for me! I usually don‚Äôt like BR games but this was pretty fun and I actually enjoyed it. I‚Äôve played like 10-15 games of it and yeah I will play this more :)
---
(assuming the check clears)
---
Just found on the east side of the county fairgrounds after 5 hops. 20 at wavy Willie's got me nothing
---
I was just stating a thought, not really against nor with the decision to change durability and sorry if it seemed like I was ignoring your statement, I do agree that it is bs that they aren't transparent with every change they make with the game that will affect they way we play/enjoy it.  It's my fault I guess that I just randomly made a statement that wasn't really directly related to your main point that shows my opinion on it.
---
  I do hope in the future they understand that making sudden changes, especially if its somewhat major, can throw players off guard and if it's a change no one likes then its gonna be more trouble.
---
Oh yeah. That's the one.
---
Anybody get disconnected every single time they try to load?
---
Seems we no longer get notification of what item is purchased from our vending machines, just a cap figure. :-(
---
I wonder if it was intentional
---
A ic hopefully they did it intentionally and this isn't change that was accidentally done
---
Nuka dark was a third party product not directly Bethesda. And it was clearly a cheap looking bottle on purchase page people just got mad for making a bad decision. 
---
Canvas bag yes big issue no excuses. 
---
And PC community could have chilled at least A LITTLE about all this. Master race is beyond toxic now a days. But yeah it was rougher on PC to start.  Especially the wide resolution only being stretched. That was weak on beth.
---
Main, you don‚Äôt keep any equipment from NW or change your camp
---
What platform are you on?
---
Pretty sure you're in the minority either way but I'm happy you haven't had your camp attacked. I've had a much less than stellar experience.
---
what paltform
---
Only issue I've had after playing for a cpl hours is on PS4 like 1 in 10 folks have a mic so my squads have no coordination and everyone is just wandering around blindly. Maybe some sort of a chat wheel for the team could help fix that.
---
You can choose to be put into a team of 4 (including yourself), so you will have people backing you up. And trust me, from what I've seen so far, you are not alone if you don't play or like BRs. You earn xp for just staying alive, as well as killing enemies and players, so you can still earn the rewards for playing even if you don't perform well. It will be faster if you can get some kills and stay alive longer, though
---
Wait they got buffed? Oh snap. I already have two shot versions of everything. I‚Äôm excited to see what the damage is now
---
I spawned in my first match - in a stroke of luck - well away from any other players so I had time to get my bearings and scrounge up some gear. Not that it helped much, as I went up against someone and though I got a few good shots in, I completely failed to notice he had 2 mates with him so that's a fight I lost.
---
I really hope so, these guns should be extremly powerful, heavy and expensive to maintain as they're intended to be
---
Go to the atomic store and you can favorite clothes, but, i can only favorite the new coat and my trucker cap, i cant favorite my other outfits for some reason?
---
No one was interested so I guess I'll just not do it then
---
It runs of a backup generator powered entirely by canned dog food
---
Lmao fair enough. It's still pretty nice though.
---
Really hope so
---
All I did was comment out the \[Archive\] section to get it to launch. I was worried the other performance-based changes I have in there would have to be disabled as well, but nope. I also had to rename the Data\\strings folder until the tagging &amp; sorting mod gets updated. Surprisingly, I was able to leave the SFE-updated dxgi.dll file in place.
---
What?! Human NPC's are coming? Are you sure; that would be so awesome...i hope I can have a companion. üòÉ
---
Seems that everyone is trying to emulate that weiner "Angry Joe" YouTube guy.  They quote the guy verbatim en masse.  
---
"This is an objectively terrible game!"
---
Ask them what the word "objectively" means.  They haven't a fuckin clue.
---
I would assume account wide, because it shows up with the atom shop logo in my camp menu.
---
What, no love for BFF Tabitha?
---
Will give it a try
---
Follow up.  Does it count toward the challenge of deploying your camp 76 times?
---
You want to be able to have a commando style camp for survival, without having to trash your adventure camp?
---
If this is what you mean, then I‚Äôve wished for the same thing.  So I made a Survival only toon that rolls with a basic pad for repairing, stashing, then running. 
---
Yeah costs more caps but it‚Äôs worth it to me
---
I‚Äôm on ps4 I‚Äôve played over 20 games. No lag at all and I haven‚Äôt came across any bugs. Yet.
---
I think you are hot trash at the game and are trying to bullshit yourself and the community to hide the fact you suck
---
Want to know how I know this?
---
The fighting is smooth, the weapons are balanced, and camping is a impossibly hard task to accomplish in game that
---
1. Is this fast
---
2. Small map which is shrinking (which you yourself stated)
---
3. Displays a big fucking red arrow above your head when you get tagged.
---
One of things I‚Äôve learned over the past 10 years or so about these online message boards is that when somebody complains about a game and one of the first things they complain about is camping it‚Äôs not a game problem it‚Äôs that the person sucks.
---
One day brother
---
played for about an hour.. grinded on some mole men..
---
seemed ok to me...
---
YEAH YOU BETTER APOLOGISE lolol jkjk thanks bud. I still havent heard of any confirmed secret tweaks yet so maybe we're all clear and I can stay calm.
---
I did tear the ps4 apart cleaned the laser and the game started. Hmmm we will see.
---
Do the main quest until you get to the part that tells you to tune in to Rose's radio station. The area around her isn't level capped, so if a high level player was recently in the area you will get swarmed by level 50+ mobs.
---
Take your time and fully explore the forest, toxic Valley, and ash heap, and then start the Savage divide once you get to level 30 or so.
---
What platform are you on because i rarely experience any crashes or disconnects
---
Yes it is, and I'm sure you'll be able to find someone to team up with üòÉ
---
I know that‚Äôs what they said. Just wondering if anyone is experiencing any bugs or unintended consequences switching back to adventure if you know what I mean. But good to know you‚Äôre experience was solid.  Thx!
---
I also like to know
---
lol I know right
---
I‚Äôve had the game since the day it released?
---
I had missed that 2 shot was back to full damage. Time to pull some weapons out of the ol' Stash Box and check 'em out.
---
What was the rewards?
---
I'm a level 120 and I still haven't nuked :(
---
Through the atom shop, you can select which items to equip from the ones youve bought
---
Take off all your gear
---
Log out
---
Log back in, put your gear back on
---
I think we'll be seeing this kind of post more in the following days. I like the gamemode and it's pretty fun but queueing solo and getting rushed by three people at the beginning or getting to the last 5 standing and it's versus two duos or worse against a group of four, it is tough to say the least. I dont fault them though, I wish I had more friends to play with.
---
i‚Äôve leveled up in multiple matches (according to the notifications) but any of the xp hasnt gone over to adventure, it‚Äôs probably bugged. or maybe i‚Äôm just missing something.
---
This is the exact thought I had. I kept getting crappy outfits from him when he showed up.
---
I have had very minimal problems on PC the whole time
---
Most of those are unrelated to the game
---
If you‚Äôre on Xbox, I‚Äôll pay ya $20 for your game when you‚Äôre done installing it. HMU if interested.
---
Vault-Tec would like to know your location.
---
So long as it doesn't have an annoying voice/personality (like FO4s radio host...) and they add more music in...just so many times I can listen to Ol' Man Mose before wanting to put a bullet in my brain.
---
A thumbs up and extra xp
---
It will probably be a while before anybody gets that high, I'm only rank 5 and already noticing that it takes a couple good matches to rank up
---
Sometimes servers disconnect - it still happens. But I've keep workshops for hours before with no issues and sometimes you can tell when a server is going bad and you should bail - such as legendary items just laying on the floor that you can't pick up - unwarranted lag spikes etc. Sometimes tho depending on what you need- workshops aren't always the best way to get resources.
---
Yea just only on explosive heavy weapons
---
Dang, I'm on xbone or I'd join ya
---
I saw someone say they were stash boxes, but have not yet confirmed.
---
Ill buy it again just to launch on steam..
---
I mean.. Id rather just be able to get a key from bethesda for already owning it.. but that isnt going to happen...
---
Using r/fallout isn't the best example because that sub is basically just r/falloutnewvegas they shit on pretty much any game that isn't NV and were pissy the game was multiplayer and wasn't a new stand alone. If you even acknowledged it had problems but has potential you were constantly bitched and downvoted and called a shill.
---
Following
---
Good for you broo. Haha
---
I guess you meant won in your title. 
---
I just won my first match too. Me and my team all managed to get a .50 machinegun and we traveled to the center of the map just to kill anyone that came at us.
---
I would make a character specifically for survival mode but with people already being decked out and I don't feel like making another character over again(this is my third), a commando style camp would be an amazing feature. But yeah I just really don't wanna deck them out over again and transfer all my good stuff to play with.
---
No idea.  Looked in Adventure mode and didn't see anything there either.
---
Close and reopen?
---
I dont think its petty to be annoyed they broke something that clearly would have been noticed had they spent a whole 5 minutes booting up the game and shooting 2 level 1 scorched.  Especially when gunfu was one of the main reasons we wanted vats to break after a kill in the first place.
---
Not saying flip out but not saying they get a free pass because "new content" either.
---
I was looking for it the pack was live or not, but I'm back and checked myself, thanks
---
Well I've been playing solo and I'm rank 7. I only won two games. I figured there's a team out there that's won every game so far and levels up extremely fast.
---
Well how would we shit our pants then?
---
Meanwhile I'm 5 minutes into waiting for it to find a NW game.
---
Not sure, already had that done.
---
It‚Äôs a icon. Lvl 5 it‚Äôs a stash box for camp
---
We were all noobs once
---
varying, some are a minute, others have been 10+. But Im in Australia and this came out at like 4-5am for us
---
He is a liar I don't trust him.
---
you think so? that would be messed up.
---
but considering i didn‚Äòt buy the key from bethesda directly in the first place and only paid 10$ ... meh, i can do it again for steam
---
Iv played 2 games so.. You know.. Expert here.
---
The defense structure was helpful seeing over the foliage. But then everyone including enemy has markers so its kinda pointless. Also the circle moves so fast that building hinders more then it helps. Unless you pick the final spot by luck then it may help.
---
Is your monitor plugged into the video card or the motherboard? Is it trying to use onboard graphics?
---
Wow I meant it in defense of the game üòÖ idc if you think I'm gay it's just funny to make some people think you are to see their reactions. Happily married father here üôÇ‚úåÔ∏è
---
Nah man I came out saw a level 120 parked at the bottom of the stairs in power armor and almost pooped my vault suit. WE DONT WANT ANY~
---
he was an AI? 
---
never knew that woah
---
The only bug is far is it keeps saying I got a level but when I go to adventure mode there‚Äôs nothing new gained
---
i did and edited my post stuck at 18/18gig now with the same problem
---
The funny thing is, 95% of the map is desolate and the other 5% is decently busy. Didn't run into a ton of people until I hit a higher level and roamed a certain.... fancy place .
---
Thanks! So alt should be at least lvl 50 I guess.
---
Also on a PC, and had very few problems
---
Idk.. But all players have a marker.. Yellow =friend
---
Red=not friend
---
So you just shoot wildly in the direction of markers?
---
Not my thing but if ppl enjoy it go for it.
---
Yes I've seen those! I also have a snally spit attack but I don't think those will be displayable lol. But I also have my extra Enclave commendation and I think I have some super mutant body parts as well.
---
Ah yes, they should be sued and lose money... Then go out of business and none of us ever get a game from them again, thatll teach them to take longer to make a game.  
---
Meanwhile we sit here with no more entires to some of the best game series ever made.  
---
I would rather have a worse start to a game and have them fix it then get no games at all, because lets face it, it probably Zenemax calling the shots on when they need to releass these games but bethesda getting the flack for it
---
I dont get bothered personally. Just giving individuals a notion to actually use some gumption.
---
No offense taken but they have sold for that.  Not fast but they have.  I have limited supply so dont care about if they sell fast.
---
Ho don't worry I won't play it, it's a shame you think i'm making a fuss about it, I was simply replying to you and explaining why some fans might not enjoy it.
---
they already said no when they first announced it..
---
I got it on one of the early sales right after launch.. Ill wait for it to be on steam sale, no biggie...
---
Hard to say, I don‚Äôt pvp. It truly depends on whether you are playing first person or not
---
I'll try, but I've never heard that would fix a perk problem. Traveling pharmacy has no impact.
---
I haven't played Survival yet, level 120. Do I loose my chems if I die? I've kinda wanted to play here recently.
---
Meeting different opinions with "you're an unthinking sheep" just seems a bit much, I'll readily agree there are many who bang the same drums over and over despite the game making changes to fix things - but I don't think peoples criticisms are all born of baaaa'ing people on youtube. I feel the game has made changes BECAUSE of the people who speak up and voice their complaints, if everyone just always said the game was roses and sunshine - some things might not have been fixed at all.
---
Changed rhe GPU, crashes gone. Had sessions over 5 hours at good times (kids back at parent's, wife on vacation) - teammates at gtx980 experience downtime, I stay on the server and they join in.
---
Its not rocket science. Seems a difficult aspect for you to grasp though
---
To my understanding, its the consoles that have suffered the most in terms of disconnects/crashes/freezing ect...
---
This is seriously a workaround?
---
thank you!
---
I don't know what to tell you. I haven't personally even downloaded the game, I just offered the bare minimum in the way of ideas. 
---
Here are a few more:
---
Pause and resume download
---
Restart PC
---
Close the launcher and close it in task manager
---
Cancel and restart download. 
---
I don't know if any of these will work and cancelling it might make it worse.
---
The controls reset occured on Xbox too.
---
I've seen a few posts now indicating bugs when switching back to adventure. Stuff like carry weight messed up because perks aren't working correctly for weight reduction anymore. Or having more perks assigned than possible. As in have 2 points strength, yet have 3 perk cards. 
---
Not sure how wide spread or if directly related to the new mode. Might just be completely random due to new update.
---
i‚Äòm sure we won‚Äòt have to wait long lol
---
i‚Äôm a 70 and my nike quest glitched
---
Sounds like it would make life a lot easier so good luck, hope it works üëç
---
Damn, even before battle royale the movie :3
---
# DO YOU MINDDDDDDD?!?!?!
---
I‚Äôve found all the codes just no nuke suitcase. Anybody been apart of a launch yet?
---
Oh I see! I am not so great at PVP  but I plan to get in there and give it a shot. I can't aim for shit but I'm hoping I can find some melee
---
Could be it. In patch notes they talked about a much higher number.
---
Edit: And yes language bug is fixed.
---
Bad News, although visually it looks like its working, its not, the perks are not swapping out, author aware, thinks it might take a while due to nuclear winter seperate load out. 
---
 Bummed.
---
Ya but it makes me feel good inside to pretend I'm smarter than them.
---
Yes. Problems been around forever
---
SHHHHHHHHHH
---
Actually, you can get cobalt flux, (blue), from the tree sap and firecracker berries. Fluorescent flux can be found from rhododendron.
---
Not yet, this is kinda like a beta for nuclear winter
---
So uhhh... does this include **the** nuke aswell?
---
I joined an adventure server, and somebody had nuked fissure prime, but the red nuke zone was covering beyond Watoga...
---
???
---
Newbies gotta stick together
---
Explosives needed a buff if it‚Äôs going to require 5 points.
---
I tried pausing and resuming, i will try to restart my pc now. Launcher got closed with task manager and everything with no result and if i need to cancle it and download this mess again i will skip that game. I wanted to grab the game and try it out with a few friends but this incompetence from Bethesda to make a Launcher where even a simple game download is buggy is a straight no for me for this game and their Launcher. 
---
Thank you for your suggestions tho, i hope a restart will fix it.
---
So worst case, you die, lose some junk, and learn not to trust strangers so much. It's still better than what's been going on. Although, personally, I think the best solution would be guests should spawn right at the edge, or just outside the build area.
---
They kinda lied when they said your level &amp; special points don‚Äôt matter. I got a rank 3 perk card for agility in the BR mode &amp; i couldn‚Äôt equip it because my adventure mode character didn‚Äôt have a high enough agility stat.
---
Cant do a pic but have a fo76 vault boy masküëç
---
Deleting everyone's base means deleting their base.. their entire base itself &amp; everything in it. Are you unclear about what deleting something means?
---
I have to rebuild my base every time I move it because the terrain is never the same. I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one. I've never complained and I've never heard anyone else cry about it.. only you.
---
Life happens. Get over it. The world doesn't exist to rotate around you.
---
be nice if we had some kind of ping like from BFV firestorm/apex. like to be able to callout enemies or loot to teammates not using mic
---
Thank you so much. I wonder if they purposely made it so tricky to find
---
If you're using PC mods, it may be that. Seen some really funky stuff with perk manager.
---
You know the rules here, you cant leave unless you make a dramatic exit and exoect people to care
---
I want it tooooo!
---
Now if only the petrified corpses were that useful in the base game :(
---
I hope so too, can't imagine what's going on with the launcher to prevent a simple install from happening.
---
The newcaster lived 25 years BEFORE Fallout 76. if he survived the initial bombs he might be in his 60s, but it should not make it impossible to use him, we have had elderly people in Fallout games before.
---
My assumption is that the amount of the world and the amount of items rendered has been lowered allowing overall higher quality in nuclear winter
---
Im surprised and glad it seems to be running as well as it is and we arent hearing more of these stories..
---
Im sure there are plenty of hiccups Im not aware of but by all accounts things seem to be going very well.. 
---
they must have tested this.. lol
---
I'm thinking single platform floors with several levels of staircases to give you a height advantage, and platforms to put turrets on if you happen to find them. Either that, or elaborate death rooms filled with traps to kill people who come hunting for you.
---
Well if you insist
---
Doesn't sound like we have any other choice 
---
Ok, let's do it
---
You lead the way
---
Ah, good point...would love to see it applied to the main! And some of those tasty weapons, I wonder when they‚Äôre coming over?
---
We shall reclaim America and rebuild this great nation God bless the enclave
---
And Three Dog was a clever historical reference as well, which I really like
---
Ah, thank you
---
Yes, turn off "fill team" when you select the game mode.
---
Think it‚Äôs in you‚Äôre imagination from not having them. I don‚Äôt see any negative effects, I play another character that has no mutations and it acts just like that
---
They're lay around the map and make a really loud noise when you're near them.
---
I miss the glowing long dogs. They were my favorite glitchy enemy, even if it was impossible to kill them.
---
Which console?
---
Love the supply req tape idea!
---
I went to the Mothman Museum on vacation, got a T-shirt and a stuffed Mothman. I call him Mothy.  Also snagged a perfect vintage desk fan at a thrift shop just up the road from there. I‚Äôll try to group them for a pic.
---
Ok so you‚Äôre replying rudely to a new person and yes, them storing everything in everyone‚Äôs camps would be essentially deleting them. That is very different from moving camps but ok
---
Ah, that is one weird icon. Thanks!
---
I swear if Woobie isn't a companion come Autumn I will personally go to Austin and free him myself.
---
Stay away from the east side of the map until you are about level ... 25 or so? (Maybe higher, depending on the weapons you have.) 
---
Do the quests! 
---
Most players are super friendly and we like to give gifts. However, avoid random team invites unless you‚Äôve talked to the person and gotten to know them. A lot of people send random invites to get free fast travel, but sometimes it can be for nefarious reasons. (If your ‚Äúteammate‚Äù engages in PvP, that opens you up to it, meaning you‚Äôre able to be killed.)
---
Pacifist mode is essential if you‚Äôre trying to avoid PvP outside workshops. (And random team invites.)
---
Was when this was a problem agesss ago
---
It‚Äôs still a recurring problem if you **join** someone else‚Äôs games, but it was fixed from when you were just logging in
---
Ahh okay. I'm still figuring it all out haha.
---
Wanna play Nuclear Winter later?
---
I think this "crate" is the player icon of the blue crate. There's another one at 5 Wich is a workshop item (stash box)
---
Pretty sure its a camp stash
---
Wait I think we are talking about different comments. The comment I am replying to was someone talking about using the guy from fallout 4.
---
&gt; Fallout ~~3~~ style dialogue system
---
Fixed it for you
---
A fallout 76 tshirt from gamestop, only 10 bucks
---
‚ÄúWe owe them absolutely dick. They at least owe the playerbase a functioning game.‚Äù
---
...how is that mentality working Anthem‚Äôs favor?  Look, before that‚Äôs taken as more salty than it sounds, I feel like I didn‚Äôt make my post clear.  Sorry if that was the case.  There are times for constructive criticism and times for praise.  I don‚Äôt feel like we owe them anything.  I want to offer praise when it‚Äôs due.  If I make something to the point that I would sell it for money, I would have to be somewhat proud of it.  I would want the customer to enjoy it.  If I never heard praise when I did things well, only criticism, I wouldn‚Äôt know what people like...only what they don‚Äôt.
---
looks like it's not to much after I got the damage balanced out between mutations and perk cards however it does seem to be tweaked a little all around if you will. cant tell the feel of it yet since I just got teamed back and up have not got to nuke a queen yet.
---
Don‚Äôt know why this is downvoted. It‚Äôs the truth.
---
They wouldn‚Äôt write this about a good game. The reason it‚Äôs funny is because it‚Äôs true but still obvious exaggeration.
---
Sounds good.
---
Yup they do :3 Just got 'kill a player' trophy !
---
Out your PS4 into rest mode. All PS4 download speeds are throttled on the system for download while on. It‚Äôs so you can play online and download a game at the same time. If you put it into rest mode the cap is lifted. Just check it in an hour after.
---
Been playing for about an hour now. West coast usa
---
That's awesome. I'm going to have to drink some now...
---
Sure sounds great.
---
I think you detailed the way alot of players got their initial impression of the game so I think the opinion is warranted. And I agree that if people see if what the game has actually become as opposed to spewing random untrue vitriol it could definitely do some good for it! Hopefully most people have a positive impression this time around!
---
Todd Howard got absolutely grilled by the Internet for like 6 months and became one of the most hated people on the internet. Despite that, he showed his face publicly at the biggest gaming convention on the planet and apologized publicly. Not even the people who made No Mans Sky had the balls to do that.
---
This further cements in my mind that Todd is the ultimate Alpha male and probably smashed DoomGuy‚Äôs mom.
---
Me and my team somehow spawned all across the map and each made our way to the middle of the storm killing everyone we saw and winning the match, so much fun.
---
There is a solo mode. Queue up and turn off the "autofill team" option and you can play by yourself. You can also team up with friends from the main menu so you can have squads of 2-4 filled with people you know.
---
If you've got bad teammates it's essentially singles, for you at least.
---
FLIRT
---
Oh ok, I was wondering if this was possible before my cousin got on.
---
When I remove my Class Freak card, all my Special stats change. Try it.
---
I feel this on a personal level lol
---
Two questions, and at the risk of making you feel like an idiot, is it powered on?
---
Are you leaving the workshop a lot? Someone might be taking the supplies, so you should lock the extractor.
---
apex is over there
---
&gt; it makes me wonder if real testing was used
---
I've worked in software, games even, for about 20 years. I have never, ever worked at a place that didn't have a QA team. 
---
I have worked at *many* places that didn't make a priority of fixing the problems that QA found. 
---
I have been in meetings where we discussed an issue, and the meeting took longer than the fix would have taken, if anyone was allowed to work on it, which they weren't. 
---
So in my experience, don't blame QA. Blame whoever prioritizes what to work on. There is likely a producer, designer, or product manager that deserves your ire more than the QA team.
---
Any news on being able to respec? Haven't heard much about it.
---
Winner winner bloatfly dinner.
---
I‚Äôm sorry, but are you trying to shame someone over quality of life video game preferences... in a video game sub?
---
Hi! Thanks for your report, we will investigate. As some added information that may help our investigation: 
---
* Do you (or did you) have any mods installed after downloading today's patch? If so, which ones?
---
hairy Gary
---
if you make a character fresh out of the gate, &amp; jump into BR, you won‚Äôt be able to equip any card higher than a rank 1 card because your adventure mode character does not have those special points allotted. 
---
A bit of a stretch to call it an ‚Äúunfair‚Äù advantage, but there is an advantage to being a higher character level in the BR mode.
---
Lol oh please, I probably just made every newbie reading that want to try it that much more and it will still be just as hillarious when they meet their first sheepsquatch... at level 2.
---
XD
---
I‚Äôm only interested in PvE, but I can imagine it‚Äôs better for us if they get another revenue stream for Fallout 76. 
---
Also, since there‚Äôs no risk of losing any items I tried a few games in the new mode and had fun with it!  Might try it as a way to level up new characters.

Congrats man, hope to not get smeared by better players when I get back home to try it out.
---
Well the only thing the Restart did is making instead of 18gig 17gig which is supposed to be downloaded already so nothing.
---
My Download should have been finished 30 min ago and my friends are waiting for me to join. Such a shame that bethesda cant even get this simple thing right without having to be bugged. Thanks for your effort but i skip this game its simpy not worth it, waiting for the download beforehand and now 30 min just to try to fix Bethesda's Mess with no result. I wish they would just have brought it on Steam right away instead of experimenting in stuff they have no clue about seemingly
---
He can apologize by giving me 35% off on Fallout 5 when it comes out for buying 76 at launch at full price.
---
They have mentioned a while back that things like team deathmatch and stuff might be added, that probably means they will add them since they were already considering those modes
---
Thanks! I think it would be a perfect fit, especially since the relay tower is well within the storm.
---
Everyone should try it at least once.  And the first one is always free...
---
Sure people aren't snagging them? Make sure it's locked so that only you can use it. Also make sure that you have enough generators to power it, and that they're wired to the machine itself. I felt like a fool because I didn't actually attach my water purifiers to the generator in camp, figured it out after an hour.
---
You're paying for the jacket and the atoms are free. ;)
---
The number one positive thing I can give Fallout 76‚Äôs launch is that me and my friends were actually able to log into the game when it released. I couldn‚Äôt say that about BFV, Sea of Thieves, and other big AAA games in the past year.
---
I could find a single bullet... Think my team mates were just taking the ammo.
---
But if you pick up a weapon it auto equips. It's a BR. Ill be in survival now i can be left in peace.
---
The only one that I have.
---
Pre-Dog.
---
Dude the aesthetic design direction is shit and the critisism totally valid for the most part. We have more mascot heads and fur suits than we do legitimate faction items that are true to the franchise.
---
I love this game but please don't encourage more of this visual stupidity.

It still puts you against premades and it sucks sooo fucking bad, cus every game is just VS 4man squads when ure solo

Try to play with friends. (its better that way) don't play survial at anything below level 50+.(you will get killed by level 150 like I do) use the inspirational perk that will give you a xp boost when playing with a team. Try making a C.A.M.P in a good location like the posiden power plant and try to farm it for XP,Loot and generator plans  (it gives like 100 to 200 XP) Good luck :)
---
My two shot fatman is grateful and comfortably sitting at 1888 damage
---
Hahaha fair enough. If I get home and the fianc√© wants it I‚Äôm sure we will buy it. I tend to waste atoms on really silly things so I may owe her Maxon‚Äôs coat lol
---
The first sixty days of this games life were hellish, and I cannot condone the state of this game at launch or Bethesdas corporate decisions surrounding it and pre-ordered materiel.
---
That being said, now that the game has seen a couple months worth of patching and updating it doesn't even resemble the game at launch anymore, to me atleast.
---
I love the events, throwing soup at new players, and leaving bagged fertilizer on the doorstep of the old players. Working through the creepy ambient locations, and enjoying the lighthearted easter eggs.
---
The game is also surprisingly couples friendly, my wife and I have encountered a fair bit of similarly paired players out there.
---
Ooh, I'll place it right next to Vending machine now where players spawn!
---
Having radiation is a negative effect which should lower maximum health points, not available health points.
---
I'm surprised this haven't been fixed since Fallout 4
---
I see your point, I'm pretty much feeling like you. But in this circle jerk you are fucked if you don't love the game
---
That sounds almost like they reverse the prior explosives nerf. Wouldn't be surprised since they constantly have patch/version control problems.
---
"informed consumers", You mean sheep people that can't form their own conclusions since they haven't played it at all. Cool deal! I'll tell you what Reggie said a long time ago. PLAY THE GAMES.
---
brock15415
---
I really didn‚Äôt consider that point. I mean if your paying someone to test why do you not fix the issues found? Management at its finest.
---
I thi k it just effexts some people more than others....   
---
Or, just like with bugs, somw people just have a suoer low telerence for them and expect perfection, since many people say the game was "unplayable" yet i have managed to pkay it just fine

Is that T51 paintjob based off the Brotherhood Outcasts from FO3? Holy heck.

That's bizarre. This game seems to just wreak havoc on random people who play on Xbox. I feel your pain. I haven't had issues myself but I get at least one crash every single time I play this. I played for about 5 hours one Saturday two or three months ago and it crashed nine times. Got dropped from my server 21 and 14 minutes after launching my first two nukes... the game deleted my best weapon.... I made a post about a lot of issues here https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bz1ah3/these_bugs_are_just_silly/ . The WiFi thing is a new one to me. Do you have this problem with any other games?
---
The issue can be hardware related. Not all games have the same networking load. Reset you router and use default settings. Other than that the issue could be presenting in another game eventually.
---
&gt; Commentary on all the idiots who called the repair kits P2W
---
Eh, argument could be made that it is - but much of the anger was because repair kits aren't cosmetic, which is what the atom store was said to only sell.
---
See I wasn't crazy when I posted playing the Alpha,
---
It's light, fast, fun and yet feels like fallout
---
it's still trash. fanboys be fanboys
---
Where's my canvas bag
---
You got a nuke too?? That's awesome! Glad you're having a *blast*!
---
I feel like I shouldn‚Äôt have written about Todd...lol...it‚Äôs just he‚Äôs the one that said it.  I was seeing him as representing Bethesda and a response in kind.  What I will say is that I would only blame one person when everything goes wrong if I would give only that person credit when everything goes right.  No one would give him credit for all the good...that goes to Bethesda as a whole...and I have a hard time seeing it differently when I turn that around.
---
I would throw money at a sheepsquatch plushie!
---
Ghouls and melee scorched enemies will beeline, but that's typical behavior for a "rush" type mob. Some of the smarter creatures and enemies like scorched and super mutants with ranged weapons will use various tactics like taking defensive positions behind walls, trees, cars, etc and sniping at you.
---
Took you're advise and also all removed all my perks. That seems to have work. 
---
Because 3rd person enables the user to see around corners and over objects.
---
Rose sounds too much like Wreck-It-Ralph's Vanelope all grown up.  Crazy glitch sending me out on suicide missions..
---
vats is still useful for PvE stuff
---
Agreed. Good idea. Anyone else having a blast btw?
---
correct
---
Every blue moon I‚Äôll suffer a crash (averaging once every 96 hours according to my spreadsheet) and I‚Äôll be heavily over-encumbered and unable to sprint. A re-log fixes it every time, thus far.
---
They said repair kits and things available in game. People miss that part a lot.
---
Just crashed while in second place in nuclear winter üò¶ but only crash in a few hours so not bad
---
As others have pointed out, are you using PLM?
---
If you are disable it. Patch 10 has broken it.
---
No matter what perks you apply, they won't 'register'.

---
 &gt; You got a nuke too?? That's awesome! Glad you're having a *blast*!
---
PC here, in fairness minimal issues. 
---
I did experience the Day One beta bug where clicking any button in the launcher deleted the game and required another 50GB download, which is inexcusable.
---
Yeah it's just a pain in the ass to have to move things one at a time every time I go into a stash. Deposit, back out, deposit, back out.. &gt;.&gt;
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs available yet.
---
Wood armour.
---
Wood amore
---
I tried that and it did help, was at like 12FPS with extremely low GPU usage (5-10%)/ before. But im not sure how to further increase performance.
---
This would be great...a good example from another game (The Division) is the Rick Valassi (sp?) channel where he spouts conspiracy theories all day long (all right, it's just an hour's worth of time in real life)...but considering all of the problems with the vaults, power struggles between factions, etc. it would make for some good backdrop noise.
---
but nuka world was my favorite dlc
---
just one sided, if you wanted the coolest content you had to side with the raiders. I imagine this manifestation will be more balanced.
---
Reported for not liking the game enough
---
You want to sit there longer????
---
how do you turn damage numbers on on adventure mode?
---
I use them to get rid of the weight
---
Oh no, is this back? This is the worst bug I have had to deal with since beta. Do you have to do it everytime?
---
 Gun Fu broken confirmed, but then it worked again, then it was broke again...
---
A Bethesda thing without a lot of bugs? What year is it?
---
Maybe you can find v51 in adventure/survival mode?
---
sounds like they accidentally undid the previous nerf
---
enjoy your temporary opness
---
I was using perk manager and a couple of other mods, but patch 10 broken them all. I was running clean when I had the problems, but my config might have been fried. I'll try reinstalling mods later.
---
I get people like BR modes, I just hope some other team is working on this one. They really shouldn't be wasting resources on this mode when the main game still had major issues.
---
I don't have this problem with any other games but the repetitive disconnects and crashes happen too
---
Your fps would tank hard.
---
&gt; I mean if your paying someone to test why do you not fix the issues found? 
---
Ultimately you don't have the resources to fix everything, so you do the most important stuff first. Where things fall apart, IMHO, is when someone in charge has a very wrong idea of what "important" actually means. 
---
Or, when that someone sticks to what is "important" to the exclusion of EVERYTHING else. Maybe there is an embarrassing typo in the product. Well, it doesn't BREAK anything, right? You can still play? So it goes to the bottom of the list even if it would be a trivial fix. Pretty soon, your product is overrun with little issues and looks like crap, but hey, none of them are "important."
---
Also, I can tell you from extensive personal experience, that the longer an issue goes on, the easier it is for the whole team to let it slide. You let a really bad bug linger for a while, and the world doesn't end, and then it just gets harder and harder to find the time to fix it ...
---
Well not sit there, just have the opportunity to free roam for a while!
---
It's started and yes you can team up to squad of 4. Don't think npc are here yet.
---
Couldn't tell you where i found it tbh, fairly certain i just picked it up somewhere
---
This will be patched in two years
---
Free trial week has started + the trial run of Nuclear Winter.
---
You may premake a team for NW via social menu.
---
The NPCs are part of Wastelanders which is year 2/winter content.
---
The Mire. The Entire Mire is Haunted. There's a Samsquanch out there
---
I sure hope so!
---
You're gonna be sick of the sight of it after a while, *errrrrbody* is gonna be wearing it. Imagine it like the Hunter's Longcoat was easily available, it'd be the favourite of a lot of players until they saw 40% of every server wearing it
---
I seem to remember people on this sub advocating *not* to buy repair kits at any cost to show Bethesda that we're not accepting them breaking their 'only cosmetic items' promise for the shop?
---
Haha thanks...
---
OMG yes that was me lmao
---
You were crouching on the roof of your camp and I was like "well it is survival" *pew pew pew*
---
fun times. hope you enjoyed the caps! I needed that plan haha
---
That's bizarre. Have you tried a clean install?
---
Nah it‚Äôs trash. Bad combat ruins it
---
I'm just assume that they're adding Wastelanders mode and not replacing Adventure mode with it.
---
Uhm, fallout 76 is an online multiplayer game . There's no single player mode
---
&gt; So do I just scroll over someone else camp and it will show me there is plans?
---
Yeah, all the green tent icons on the map are players with active vending machines. Hover over them and it'll show a little category list (weapons, armor, meds, plans, junk, etc) and how many of each category they have. 
---
Also, unrelated to the brahmin pen, try to find someone camped near the Whitesprings train station. It's a very valuable travel spot since it's right in the middle of the map, and when people nuke the resort it's usually used as a safe travel point just outside the blast zone.
---
Best of all, that side of the resort is heavily patrolled by high level non-hostile (unless you attack them) robots, so you should be able to safely walk from the station to the front door of the hotel. Go in the front door, go down the steps, and hang a right. You'll find a long hallway filled with shops, and vendors from every faction are down there, so if you can't find something at a player vendor you can probably find it there.
---
level 7 atm, its pretty cool, i dunno about the rewards though as i've not got anything  yet
---
But the first time you mess up big...   Lol
---
Other than that, refreshing your ini files (remove the fallout 76 folder in documents/my games) or updating your drivers, I'm not sure that much else could be done.
---
Wrong, it is only throttled when playing games. Not while just being on. I can have my ps4 on no games. Download at 40mbps or more.
---
MTWGA!
---
It's much more fun if you get in a squad and play! Never done BR either! Played for 3 hours today and had a blast.
---
Not sure sorry
---
Lol, game was getting boring üòâ
---
At least they‚Äôll know how to read the in game prompts and get their backpacks, scrub.
---
What's even worse is people are openly hateful of those who bring up valid criticisms, calling them names and telling them to go away. Seems many of the launch issues were fixed quickly because of the people openly calling them out
---
People shouldn't spot you if you're not running around and actually crouch
---
yes.. it says so right in the OP
---
Serves you right! No mutants allowed!
---
I had the same thoughts... Hence a previous comment on Bethesda serving us cold piss.
---
To be fair, I had similar reservations about Nuclear Winter, and while it's nothing special, it feels like Fallout BR and that's good enough for me.
---
So, while I refuse to get my hopes up, I also refuse to completely abandon hope altogether.

One word: NukaShine
---
originally i did a clean reinstall to fix the crashes but this was the result
---
I'll do more research later
---
Not all PS4 do that. My OG and Batman edition do not.
---
I won my 1st game. First win in any BR game in my life. It really felt good but since then I usually end up in some 10 - 15ppl slaughterhouse :D 
---
Anyway, after 2 hours playing I must say I had really great time. However I still dont know where to unlock those chests I got from overseer level.
---
How hard is it to kill a lvl 230 player?
---
, just started yesterday
---
That's still rare?
---
Thanks, I‚Äôm hoping you‚Äôre right. I put my ps4 to sleep and immediately the voip call I was on went to shit. It must have started using more bandwith
---
the only thing it's amazing at is making me realize how seamless and better at everything fortnite is than this crap battle royal.
---
bethesda's head is still in their ass. shitty weapon swapping, shitty looting, shitty weapons, shit forcing squads, i could go on. it literally does nothing better than any other battle royal out there and bethesda fanboys 'oh it's so good'.  no it's not!
---
thanks fortnite for raising the bar and thanks bethesda for milking your fanboys.
---
Yeah those were great.
---
I've actually got a video from November with one of those.
---
Same, level 7 too. It's not much of a reward but there's a holotape behind the stage with the musical instruments for anyone over level 6.
---
What reason does a person or group of people have to be personally attacked?
---
If i was to guess, i would say theyd replace what we currently have with it, however, it would be better to have like a drop down menu for the different years they do this, like it said in the trailer, year 2 begi s with wastelanders, so there xould be year 1 what we have now, year 2 with wastlanders, year 3 with whatever they change it to next year... Ect...  
---
That way bew players could still exoerience the growth of the wasteland
---
Damn. That sucks : (
---
Everyone... even playing field.
---
I hope we can have robots. I enjoy them as companions so much more than people or dogs.
---
My main is HW/explosives, in power armor. Transitioned to doing it as a low-health build around January-February. 
---
It‚Äôs goddamn amazing, especially since you get so many toys to play with that all actually work (well, except the broadsider. Poor thing). My fat man can oneshot mirelurk queens, missile launcher can one shot sentry bots, autogrenade can oneshot most anything else. And those aren‚Äôt even my normal use weapons. Bloodied primed (good god I‚Äôd give a lot for a BE; 32% dps increase for me!) 50cal for the queen or ending SB in seconds, instigating 25% fire rate gatling gun for daily trash and long range accuracy, vampire LMG for massive self-heals. 
---
And all those weigh less than 1 rifle, with Bear Arms. I do use ordinance express for the explosives though- 10 mininukes, 40 missiles, 80 40mm grenades, plus 5-30 grenades and mines at any one time. Although I don‚Äôt use the grenades or mines much anymore. Still have 1star perk for the throwing ark though!
---
what in the world makes you think a BR is a "proper mode" for a freaking fallout game.
---
Have you tried playing?
---
I notice it in every game that allows you to jump freely from Crash Bandicoot, GTA, Halo, Conkers Bad Fur Day, etc. Only games I've ever noticed you can't are game where you can only jump at certain times Legend of Zelda OoT, Tomb Raider, and Uncharted are the ones that come to mind there.
---
*maybe*  
---
I'd be naive to think they didn't hope..
---
Right but aren't those more related to the business departments and heads of Bethesda and not the actual developement team?
---
You take other perk cards off ..don‚Äôt have to have a card in each stat, just a total of 7 cards or ranks.
---
Social Tab - Click Name - Invite when waiting to loadout.
---
I would love to but voice chat has never worked for me and i dont discord.. 8(
---
good luck and many frags to you!
---
YES! It‚Äôs actually really fun. Make sure you perk into it as well as a weapons class. There‚Äôs some pretty neat perks associated with non-PA build.
---
Edit: autocorrect mistakes
---
Edit/addition: as well as a sniper build, I‚Äôve got some one handed melee perks as well. Really helps once you‚Äôve been noticed
---
wow man you're angry, take a chill pill no?
---
Cringe LOL
---
That would be a good way to use the vats button to do that instead since we cant vats in this mode anyway.
---
It told me I got a small crate when I ranked up. I have no idea what this reward is.
---
How about this? https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=3f5459f&amp;d=sg2pd2pk2pp2pl2p02ej4c72i12ic1a72am2a00a31lt1lv0l12lr2l71la2&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=
---
It's Maxons Battlecoat from Fallout 4
---
Chad.
---
The game, appears to have been designed with an Arc and "chapters"..   
---
Maybe a failed experiment, but we will know either way in time
---
Thanks I guess
---
ahaha that was so much fun, glad you're a satisfied customer! when you first started shooting i freaked out and ended up hitting my weapons workbench lol
---
Where is it I can‚Äôt find it in the atom bundles
---
Haha totally understand and I've been the "lazy" one in the past, let's hope it's not an exception but a step in the right direction
---
 check atom shop?
---
I‚Äôm pretty close to those, I‚Äôve got atrength maxed out though, as no PA mean significantly reduced carry weight. It‚Äôs also kind of difficult to get the ‚Äúweightless‚Äù items to assist.
---
I was playing H1Z1 Just Survive before getting into FO76. I didn't think the bugs at launch were all that bad. Relatively speaking, of course.
---
My dude, pvp without salt doesn't exist. May be a single grain sometimes, but salt non the less.
---
12% accuracy reduction with class freak
---
Agreed, the BR might not be for you, but worth playing a couple games if nothing else!
---
May Atom bring you strength with his glow!
---
To clarify in the vault when connecting to players there is a sign that says ‚ÄúZax will award victorious overseers with exciting prizes and gifts!‚Äù
---
Bethesda is powerless
---
Same! Also push to talk and vats. PC here, no mods at all.
---
So theres pve stuff too?
---
That what I was thinking. It's just a couple of guns, but they are irreplaceable at this point.
---
Allowing to many would lead to loss of build diversity. They've already said that in an upcoming dlc there will be a prestige system in place.
---
Yeah I looked but didn‚Äôt see anything.. I‚Äôll have to check it out again and look better
---
https://imgur.com/a/J8wBiYO
---
&gt; Sliding and launching enemies?
---
Curious, I've never seen that. What GPU do you have?
---
Which part?
---
Mine didn't?
---
all, it just disappeared from the pipboy
---
I have felt a little squishy. But I would rather have squishy over the rage that comes when you put 20 bullets in someone and they keep walking. (Apex/fortnite)
---
Yeah, you can kill creatures for some loot. Though I think the Scorchbeast is there to prevent camping, since it seems to only appear on the last circle.
---
Thanks. I'll make some tweaks.
---
Hahaha I didn't mean coming out of the closet ya ding dong.
---
Xbox one og. Did you watch the clip? Enemies slide a couple times a week for me
---
Thanks for slogging through the wall of text, **Twice!**.   
---
It's easy to forget and loose perspective, I'm guilty of it as well, I'm cautiously and guardedly optimistic and that's all I can hope to encourage in people...
---
Good luck buddy!
---
Think it's only specific outfits.
---
You will have to lean on power armor at first, if you don't go pure stealth. Once you establish a strong set of perk cards and a half decent, full set of med-heavy armor you won't need power armor unless you're going into a nuke zone. 
---
Fireproof is a must, adamantium skeleton is a close second.
---
I‚Äôd prefer higher end armor be actually worth the weight, especially with only 100 carry weight.
---
Oh man, imagine if *all* the factions have been hiding all this time and end up coming back for a big new faction content drop, with players having the choice to ally with one faction only for unique bonuses. Where is Raleigh Clay anyway? (He's probably dead somewhere)
---
It‚Äôs a fuckin Samsquanch Ricky!
---
Welcome üôÇ Have fun üôÉ
---
What article mentioned companions?
---
Not going to argue with the failings customer support side, in the least.  
---
No response to appeal?   
---
No request for an "apology?"  
---
Nothing?
---
The main gate terminal requires an overseer rank of 99. My guess is you gain the entire vault as a home/base then
---
\*whispers\* I really like your armor and stuff.
---
Ah, I didn't notice that it was XBox, I did watch.
---
I wonder if it's platform or GPU dependent. I have NVidia GPU, while XBox one have AMD.
---
Nooooooooooooooooooooo
---
I definitely think you should have more weight considering the menu is still clunky and takes forever to find and drop weapons. But I want high end armor to do more, but I also don‚Äôt want a level 3 armor issue like blackout had for so long. That was so irritating.
---
I powered them with 2 small instead of the medium generators :( :(
---
So stupid, had 2 workplaces for over 2 hours :D
---
Well that's enough for today ;)
---
Thanks for the swift reply!
---
I dont personally want faction armor that much. I really enjoy the design and there is so much for everyone to customize and and creative with.
---
To each their own really.
---
[The soundtrack to this post](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK5sIE1PEwQ) as I envisioned it when reading the last part of the OP.
---
Yeah so that one guy that finds a legendary explosive shotgun can one shot everyone right
---
I think that might be a reward from the new mode maybe. It shows it in the vault.
---
The people who are complaining about the fact that "ThEy FiNaLlY mAdE a FuLl GaMe AnD aDdEd NpCs!" annoy me the most.  It's called storytelling you simpletons.  They're trying to make an evolving storyline, I can respect that because it's insanely risky.
---
Just won a game by dropping a nuke on 4 pour souls, can confirm it was amazing
---
I try not to go to that sub anymore it's a shit hole.
---
now that we know the real reason there are no people outside the vault right now we should all feel bad...
---
I'm unfortunately at a fairly low level (40) so I still need supplies myself but I'm always willing to help out a new person if I can, if I have anything to spare for a friendly face I will but I usually put stuff in my shop for cheap caps cause I know how hard it can be to level up sometimes.
---
Feedback I have so far is:
---
Add a PING system like Apex
---
Add a minimap
---
Keep custom keybinds from Adventure mode
---
It doesn‚Äôt sound like the legendary effect explosive was buffed,  just the weapon class classified as explosive.
---
No.  It‚Äôs good the way it is.
---
Not necessarily. If there‚Äôs no branching - all of the recorded dialogue could be used.  And if they have someone on staff do the voice, they could add a half dozen new lines every patch to keep it changing. 
---
But if I were Todd, here‚Äôs how I‚Äôd do it - I‚Äôd make it a contest. If you‚Äôre copying Fortnite with BR, why not also copy Boogiedown?  Every patch, have people submit their readings of a couple lines, pick a winner to record half a dozen additional ‚Äúsecret‚Äù lines. Pick a few runner-ups and hand out a pile of Atoms and maybe an exclusive CAMP radio transmitter decoration. Boom, everyone on the team gets their bonus for player engagement. 
---
Bonus - when the next patch and second contest winner content is ready to go live, add a quest to hunt down and disable the previous underground radio host to unlock the new radio host.
---
Y‚Äôall can‚Äôt drop a nuke on someone in fortnite so run along
---
imagine getting downvoted for this. lmao this sub
---
remove the perkmanager.ba2 file all i did
---
Playing solo is a bad idea.
---
There‚Äôs 3 new dlc quests, go to any train station and there are posters on the wall. When you finish them they give you repeatable daily quests and you‚Äôll also get some good CAMP items for them
---
Those "many" people that say they won't buy a bethesda game are the same one's frothing at the mouth for BE6 and starfield.
---
Your progress does carry over.
---
Sadly there isn‚Äôt a way for singles or duos much like apex.
---
In BR all existing perk cards have been combined to always have max effect, price is also different. You also can have only one perk active at a time per special, +10 completely new perks specifically for BR
---
Why assume we have nothing in common or don't want the same goals in the game?  
---
I'm being aggressively neutral in the post, trying to weed out extremes of positive or negative responses to keep credibility and neutrality, and it could be that rubbing you the wrong way, and
---
I apologize if that is the case.  
---
That said, there were 7 others, so even if we don't share a vision, one of the others might be closer to your desired goals.
---
so you're saying we shouldn't hold the companies responsible for their screw ups?
---
I think, then, that you'll get the worse start you want, but will never get the fixes you're hoping for, and gaming as a whole will get worse for consumers.
---
I just don‚Äôt like the fact that taking out Power Armor of all things is just as easy as taking out someone in wood armor. It feels *too* equal.
---
Don't feel too bad, I wondered why no one came to my vendor shops for two weeks, I never actually connected them to the generator I built JUST FOR THEM.
---
Honestly
---
have you tried it yet? Mine is downloading right now, but I am worried that it is a demo version and not the full experience
---
Take your time. Don't go straight to the higher level zones.
---
The crates drop at specific level intervals. The perk cards are much more common.
---
Yes - are you OK with fallout? if so you'll do ok.
---
Solved the problem. I needed to restart my PSN after the update.
---
At level 7-ish a NW Crate unlocked for me (I think... the notifications don't last long), it shows in the atom shop now... I'm going to assume it's a stash box. I've never been beyond #2 in a game yet.
---
Mine has almost finished downloading. I do not think there is a demo version, so fingers crossed you got the right one!
---
Can't we give them a break for trying something new? If you compare this new version of Fallout at launch against their other games they are more experienced with making we are judging the game against an unrealistic scale. They tried something new and had some problems they didn't see coming. I wouldn't call the game garbage, more like unfinished. To be fair they are finishing it and not asking for any additional funds... If in the end they produce a good game, we all win.
---
Haha this cracked me up
---
Epicc
---
I have not been able to play it every day, but have been playing for about 6 months. I just now made it to Whitesprings. It's as if I'm playing an entirely different game now. I think the notion of just how different it is should be paid attention to by Bethesda. Part of the hesitation was because of that damn Scorchbeast that gets triggered if you head east as the crow flies from riverside manor. I went around to the north, using the mountain to hide myself and avoid it.
---
NP, thanks. I was, but patch 10 broke it, so I had the problems running clean. I'll try reinstalling later and see if things still work.
---
Just logged in and took a look and at 70hp out of 240 I‚Äôm apparently getting 863 on my bloodied DCG with adrenal reaction, a weighted right arm, no talons mutation and unyeilding armour which I think is around about where it usually is but I can‚Äôt remember exactly what it was before lol
---
Join us and help us rebuild this great nation
---
OK everyone. We need to boost this one.
---
The emotes should just be a baked in part of the game.
---
Photomode poses - sure charge me for them.
---
The necessities - needing to place a camp and eat and drink - come on.
---
from how far away?
---
It‚Äôs in adventure/survival rn, just can‚Äôt get inside. North of Aaronholt Homestead it‚Äôs unmarked
---
Yeah, I'm having the same issue, iv been getting one shotted as well.
---
I just had 4 up close shotgun blasts to an enemy that registered over 100 damage each, he turned around and shot hit marketed me twice and I was dead, in power armor no less.
---
Is anyone else having to download a 66 gig update on PS4?
---
Ugh I'd go talk to the some of the NPCs where you left off, see if you can trigger it. You on PC?
---
It's a BR mode, that means gameplay changes.
---
Too squishy? It's been balanced around fights/matches ending quickly and onto the next one.
---
Getting downed and killed? It's a PVP mode, it happens. 
---
The storm moves fast? Move before it does, it's your choice to stand around.
---
But meh. It's just a Pre-Beta, things will be adjusted when it's taken offline again.
---
Feedback is feedback, but somethings are inherent to the game mode.
---
Starting with underarmor while others can't wouldn't be very fair...
---
Allright. The game is a blurry laggy mess with "buy microtransactions" popups in a AAA game. Hopefully next one isn't a cashgrab!
---
Kinda lokked like the tenticle monster in lucky hole
---
This type of game rewuires it to be good, it makes it money through lengivity, so its in the interests to make it good or people wont play or at least not for very long, and then they won't be spending money in the atom shop ect...  
---
Ive played many games in early access ect... Games that really showed peomise, but what made me stop playing them was the lack of content and updates theyd get.  
---
Now by all means complain about the things you want fixed ect... But some people were literally pulling lawsuits against bethesda because of this game, and i oersonally think thats just insane
---
In my experience the accuracy 'malus' seems to only affect VATS.
---
Is hard to tell if it affects hip-fire at all and doesn't seem to affect aiming down-sights or scoped aiming.
---
So this sub is only for people who have positive things to say about Bethesda? Checked rules a few minutes ago and nothing lists that its against the rules, maybe people who criticize the game care about the game hence why they still here?
---
Chad
---
Search the PS store under free or try. It might be under demo.
---
Thanks for the tips! Can‚Äôt wait for sever to be up!
---
It was pretty close it should‚Äôve killed him on top of that I hit him twice
---
If there's no moonshine mama mask I send it back
---
&gt;I haven't played in two weeks, is Nuclear Winter ALREADY out?
---
Yes. They walked out on stage at E3 and laid out all the upcoming content, and then dropped the "BTW, this shit drops tomorrow."  They're also doing a free week on all 3 platforms, so it'll probably be full of squeakers for a the next few days.
---
I tried disabling vsync in the ini, some people said it worked for them but it didnt do anything for me. Thanks for the help though.
---
I know its not an issue with my GPU because I havent really had any issues with other games
---
Huge fckn no
---
This is why democracy doesn't work.
---
Lvl 5 will reward you with the option of building a small nuclear winter container in your camp back in adventure or survival mode. The container will work as a stash box. Regarding the rewards for the previous lvls it seems that we get a player icon and a photo frame. At least thats what others have stated. I kinda missed how and when I received the first rewards myself, but I can confirm the lvl 5 reward. So I guess that it will continue like this and when you reach certain levels, you will get specific rewards.
---
Hey bubs you watching this documentary on Saskatchewan‚Äôs?
---
So I feel like an idiot,  but I don‚Äôt see ‚ÄúTop Demos‚Äù anywhere... I‚Äôm looking in the PlayStation store
---
The Canvas Bag and Nuka Dark debacles are absurd and I'll die on that hill every damn time.  Firstly, the Dev Team isn't even responsible for merchandise, so they may have input in it but ultimately it's not their priority.  And Secondly, these ideas go through thousands of iterations.  At least the Canvas Bag had some legitimacy, but even then they reserve the right to make changes to the Collector's Edition.
---
No.
---
Ty and nice character btw
---
toward the east of the map
---
Maybe he used critical
---
Only if it's been modded.
---
The only difference between underarmours otherwise is the Marine one weighs twice as much as the others.
---
They had their chance with top of the world radio and rose. God that channel is lazily annoying.
---
Interesting post. Gives me a lot to think about, but I still think that serving us a full priced game that turned out to be a 2 year long project just isn‚Äôt what I want. I want a complete game that gets even better over year like Rainbow Six Siege, not the barebones of what could be a game but needed another year of dev time and was thrown into the Wild. Not sure if we have the devs or publisher to blame for that (probably the later) but I guess it‚Äôs good to know the people on the ground actually give a fuck.
---
And again, you aren't listening to me at all. 
---
There is a difference between critisizing it in order to see some change. And just being shitty to e everyone who likes it or defends it. It doesn't need to be a fight. If one doesnt like the game , yes it seems strange to me to hang out in the sub spreading toxic messages. 
---
If they dont like it, but play it, I'm confused. 
---
If they dont like it but want to see it get to a point where they personally believe its plays le and good, then they can be constructive and productive with their dialogue. 
---
What are you even arguing for still man. Move on.
---
I‚Äôll start by saying it isn‚Äôt always my choice to stand around, because like I said, you leave your team, you die.
---
And I don‚Äôt want this BR to be fast paced tbh. If I wanted fast fights I‚Äôd be in Apex. Nothing about Fallout is fast, it requires mental and physical prep. 
---
And yeah, true the storm is meant to push us together, but this is ludicrous. Even Apex has a reasonable storm speed.
---
Because of 5 no votes (counting me) on an idea?
---
Absolutely, playing as a solo stealth sniper and have a loot of fun. It's not to hard if you went to high level zones as a low level character. Only if you go into nuke zones you need a PA!
---
It was on Bethesda's website where they had an article about the Upcoming Wastelanders DLC
---
I can't post pics. At work. 
---
But I have the blue t-shirt, Mothman Pop figure, Excavator pop figure, and socks.
---
It is impossible to have a demo setup for 76.  They will give u full experience for the time period of the trial. Just like beta
---
I get my PvP fix from other games. No interest at all in this game mode, so I'll continue hunting rare items to sell in my shop. I'm excited for legit vault raids, though. And the entire Wastelanders content looks amazing.
---
Is adding custom.ini and changing settings not bannable? Im unsure if i should do it
---
Let's hope they fix this with the next maintenance.
---
Yeah but like what tho?? No quests. no dailies, other than SBQ the only thing remotely fun to do is farm whitesprings and the burrows
---
No gloves. I noticed that immediately and thought ‚ÄúBethesda should give us the option to equip gloves‚Äù
---
I made it halfway till my horrible aim cost me. I dieded
---
It doesn't seem like **any** of your adventure mode content is imported into NW, cosmetic or otherwise.
---
Very good deal. A $10 coat and you get 1500 points and 6 useless repair kits.
---
Surprised  myself that I'm having fun with the mode
---
This has happened to me before and was bugged for about a month. But after that I was back to normal
---
Nope
---
Which is what I do. I'm just wondering if anyone else feels the same way is all.
---
Yup that worked. Guess you can only find it under "free games.wasnr even under the category of "all games." Just free. Thanks
---
God job! I also like the free power armor skins. There will be a new skin every day so don‚Äôt forget to grab them!
---
Official stance is they're unsupported. (Eg their support cant help if you use them)
---
Been running mods on two accounts since December.
---
Not allowed in NW because stuff like glow ore/plans could be an advantage.
---
Well guess I won't be joining raiders unless they have an option to take her out permanently and with the option to mess with dead body by launching it off the Top of World with explosives.
---
I majorly changed my build, gonna try this.   [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=ffb4533&amp;d=sg2pd2pk2pp2pl2p02c72i12ic1lt2sa2sb2s61sv3eo2ej4eh2a72&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=ffb4533&amp;d=sg2pd2pk2pp2pl2p02c72i12ic1lt2sa2sb2s61sv3eo2ej4eh2a72&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=)
---
It's in a free week just download it and try it.
---
I couldn‚Äôt agree more about the ping system and minimap! The ping especially is really essential when playing a game like this with randoms.
---
Your loss
---
Uh, you can go play adventure mode still?
---
Just scroll down and read posts
---
Absolutely.
---
You actually learn after a while that PA is a crutch and you're never going to do max damage in a tin can.  This becomes even more apparent after you start getting good legendary gear and you start giving up a lot of stats for protection you wouldn't need if you were just killing things faster or smarter ie sneak and sneak attacks.  When your gear gets really really good it can even surpass PA damage reduction if you spec right and that's before considering assassins cavalier or sentinel bonuses.
---
Really hoping PA specs get some love soon.  PA is kind of an iconic part of the game and the deeper into the game you go the more "meh" it feels.  Maybe with the new game modes they will shine a little brighter if people dont have their normal gear.
---
My wife literally never uses VATS. Ever. I don‚Äôt know how she survives mole rat and bloodbug swarms.
---
Thought I read on the Bethesda site you buy them in the atom shop. Could be wrong tho.
---
You never mentioned leaving your team results in dying, you just said you got downed, then killed and that it wasn't fun, so I said that's just what happens in PVP.
---
Running with a team is a choice, not everybody wants to, so yeah, I stand by my statement about hanging around. It's a choice, die with your team, or die without them/one.
---
They tried to put him on the cover of Vogue but his legs were tooooooo long.
---
Everyday is leg day, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
---
Teeth, claws, all the way
---
I dislike PA, but you pretty much need it for nuke zones. You can opt to wear a Hazmat suit, but you'll be extremely vulnerable to any ballistic or energy dmg.
---
You have to go into the atom shop and set them as nuclear winter favorites
---
Yes, many things should be improved to make it even close to other PvP games, that's for sure. But this is what we got so far. If people are enjoying it, then it's fine. I'm sure Bethesda will tweak more things in the future.
---
Fractions aren‚Äôt fun at all, decimals suck too.
---
Do not go into survival mode,  stay in adventure if you really want to test it out,  I'm sure you will find plenty of people higher level willing to help.  Also know that the people playing nuclear winter are not necessarily like the rest of the adventurers out there
---
The goal was not to crush them, but to hold them accountable and have ticket numbers for documentation purposes.  
---
It was all to common at the point for Bethesda to hide behind the mantra of "submit a ticket" or "what's the ticket number" and the Direct to Dev path didn't give a ticket number and said as much.    
---
I'm trying to be tactful and neutral, not burning bridges or let my perceptions and human so faulty recall incorrectly paint a picture, the goal was an overview and impressions, not to hide or make myself "better" and the rest not worthy of the effort.  
---
Again I'm sorry you find the post that bothersome / cringeworthy.    
---
Everyone has a right to voice their opinion, atleast in most of the USA, less so in the EU and The rest of the world, however there is no requirement for appreciation or respect for said opinion, and some, by the very nature of our humanity will be more relevant than others.  
---
A bug report saying "shit broke, fix it" is white noise, but one detailing the steps to replicate the bug, and some suggested fixes is not.  
---
Not assumption, proven and demonstrable fact, I've been told by the mods countless trolling and overtly hostile and toxic comments have been removed in the past 15 hours proving the point, and the history of the sub(s) are well established.  
---
I am sorry you see it as basically an ego trip, and I've never once said there are not valid criticisms, posts and comments here and in other formats, quite the opposite.
---
Be aware that they can contest it and shoot you at the same time. If you are just hanging around a workshop location stay outside of the green/red "bubble" if you don't want to challenge the person contesting your ownership. This helps prevent sneak attacks.
---
**DON'T PAY THUGS** that say they will leave you alone for caps. They won't. Raiders are raiders. They will take the money, kill you, and perhaps trash the workshop.
---
Beware of low level players with high wanted bounties. They are likely a trap for higher level raider players, or they are just fools. Suffer neither one.
---
Tip for leveling fast: make your way to whitespring and stay there until you reach level 50, then you‚Äôll conquer the wasteland with ease.
---
Zd
---
No "sticking it out" for me. I genuinely enjoy this game.
---
TAKE DOWN THE REPAIR KITS
---
You didn't stick with us
---
I‚Äôll check today on mine.  I made posts about this in the past and haven‚Äôt noticed the bug in a couple of months since a patch released and fixed it.  But clearly it‚Äôs a problem still. I wouldn‚Äôt think you are bs‚Äôn
---
What you too good to get clean to visit my house? You think I want that blood from bloodied weapon all over the place? Also I just leave mine off with a switch so someone can turn it on if they want to.
---
With lots explosions. duh.
---
Then why are you here?
---
I can not wait for some more Vaults.  They are one of the best aspects of the franchise.
---
The div 2 missed its mark, so i came back to FO76 yesterday. The new mechanics are so fun if you enjoy a nice paranoid session.
---
I don‚Äôt remember if it was in the video or notes for the Wastelanders DLC, but it was when they announced the Raiders/Settlers factions that you can choose between. Juicehead also did a small analysis of the trailer, suggesting that other factions will return as well (including the BOS)
---
Bump !!!! The new players don‚Äôt know! Cmon Bethesda lol you know it‚Äôs going to be hilarious. Do eeeet
---
maybe try this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHT35fWCuQc&amp;feature=youtu.be
---
graphic preset settings to medium. The default High/Ultra settings are a real killer. Drivers should not crash of course but worth a shot.
---
So miss out on what ever becoming the overseer does?
---
Would I be able to activate the key and download in Bethesda launcher and skip installing from disk? I don't have a cd drive.
---
Im more curious what BR fans think.   Don't think someone who still plays FO76 enjoying more FO76 even if it's BR would not be a bit biased.
---
you could try taming, arktos, build a better base
---
farm things other than whitesprings, get involved in the economy, get rich, look at other players bases
---
Yea and it literally takes 5 shots with a grenade launcher to kill somebody lol
---
I‚Äôm at 7 now so I‚Äôll have to go check in adventure, didn‚Äôt see anything in the atom store.
---
But I thought getting team ranked as 1 in NW gave another reward, only from getting that not just from your level :)
---
I was considering picking up destiny 2 again but if i gotta pay to catch up ill pass
---
That‚Äôs absolutely needed, they can probably buff them even more. There‚Äôs no reason to haul a grenade launcher and rockets around when your explosive pistol and its weightless ammo do more damage.
---
I started as a PA build.  Made it to level 170ish going straight PA.  I tell u. It‚Äôs fun. I changed to an unarmored build and now am 190. So I‚Äôve had some time to experiment. 
---
changing to a sneaky unarmored bloodied build has been the funnest thing ever.  I definitely die on accident sometimes because no armor.  But sneak around one shotting people is so fun compared to spamming stimpaks in PA when facing off with some crazy enemies.
---
Possibly but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll be straight away, or least if it‚Äôs part of the wastelnders dlc it‚Äôll be close to the end of the Roadmap
---
What else besides whitesprings is there to farm?
---
Yup, exactly, the newscaster from Fallout 4, who was alive 25 years before Fallout 76. he could still be alive, we dont know if he survived the bombs.
---
And can we get a system where we can add songs? Maybe there can be holotapes scattered across Appalachia and if we give them to the radio host we will periodically hear them on the radio.
---
yeah got lags too with pretty not bad spec
---
No one said anything about canceling Bethesda. I'm basically saying dont brush off toxic game development. We need to show that it is not okay to release games in states like this was
---
I agree. I've tried to play battle royals with friends and never could get into it but this one is really fun. I got 3 killa my first game instead of sucking ass like in all the others.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt it be larger than half of your base?
---
I actually really love this game. It‚Äôs free - no downside to trying it
---
Critical doesn't apply in NW
---
Very nice.  So Bethesda has a bugged game mode? Who would have guessed..
---
Free? How?
---
I wouldn't expect you to understand, especially if you don't by now. Actually listen to people's criticism instead of fanboying when people criticize something you like. There was and still is plenty of VALID criticism for the game, Bethesda, and Todd Howard. 
---
Learn to sort out what's good criticism and bad criticism. It's an important life skill.
---
Good find, will have to read this at home.
---
Yea never understood why they were so weak compared to what it takes to maintain them
---
Outside.
---
As a separate radio, yes.  
---
I do not want a radio host to ruin my music. It's super duper luper annoying to listen to the same repetitive blah blah blah over and over again in between my songs when all I want to hear is the music itself on repeat. Three Dog got annoying after a while in Fallout 3. New Vegas's radio was annoying for it. Fallout 4's radio was annoying for it as well...  
---
Radio hosts are never fun to listen to on repeat and I do not want to have one in Fallout 76. It's one of the reasons why I can tolerate grinding in Fallout 76... I got pure music in my ears and no need to listen to "HELLO WEST VIRGINIA!!!! Today's news... Blah blah blah blah blah."
---
It‚Äôs free this week since E3. And if you wanna purchase it I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs only 17$ on Amazon and half off one the platforms themselves.
---
As a rank 9 player I think it's pretty balanced. I usually end up with an abundance of healing items when I make it to the final 10ish people. Sure rads can be a bit annoying the first half but I like that it's actually pretty deadly.
---
I mean, technically, this is a sneak peak of the mode
---
It doesn‚Äôt release for a month or so, they have time. If it even needs a roadmap... Fall from sky, kill everyone
---
Ok so this doesn‚Äôt work? Why is this so hard to download? I see fo76 but it‚Äôs still just showing the 30$ option ughh.
---
Edit: nvm
---
I still find it funny that RedEye is a literal reference to Fallout: Equestria, ha-ha-ha. He was a nice radio host for a bit until he got repetitive (like all radio hosts do in video games).
---
Got it! It‚Äôs the small supply crate, don‚Äôt see it in the atom store only in my build menu. Guess we can unlock the 2 other crates maybe :) thanks for your help!
---
Sure, but even if they never show, there shouldn‚Äôt be anything stopping my character from taking a BOS flag from an outpost they left behind.
---
Even better, feed them a few nuka colas *and* Nukashine. Every so often I brew up some shine, grab some various nuka colas, and dress in a nuka world outfit (the garish orange one), top hat, and bottle cap glasses and play the Willie Wonka of soda. It‚Äôs fun as hell knowing they‚Äôll eventually use that shine thinking it‚Äôs another health drink
---
As a bonus if it‚Äôs early enough for them they get a nice little experience/atom bump for discovering a new region
---
I just don't think they'd cut off the original content to anyone.
---
No, it‚Äôs the auto laser pistol that‚Äôs unbalanced. Thing melts.
---
You're talking about the game like you know but honestly you just sound like you have no idea. No one is just sticking it out, we love this game and play every day.  Its most likely better than the game you bought. Why come here, put the game down but then ask us to give you a reason to play. Lol sorry but no.
---
So you can only wear outfits purchased on the atom shop!?
---
This is my most-played game since it came out in beta. I'm really enjoying it, and you'll enjoy it even more as a new player coming into the game with as many improvements as it's gotten.
---
it was mostly playable but I still crash it freeze up at least once a play session every day. it used to be multiple times per session before though.
---
As far as I know.
---
Well, you have bad network cards or shitty internet. I have owned about 8 ps4s, all works fine and no issues. About 20 online mates all same. If an application is opened, it throttles it. But none opened it works fine. If you start download when playing a game, and close. It may not increase. Pause the download, and start again. It will reset and go to a faster speed.
---
I think I just got more XP for getting first, didn't notice anything else unique. Fun fact if you get a duplicate card from a pack you get 50xp instead. 
---
As for issues, I just made a post about it but my biggest feedback is the directional sound of gunshots bugs out sometimes and you hear the sound in a different spot from where its coming from. Also the "constant gunfire" bugged sound is back in this mode, where it sounds like a machine gun is firing constantly from a random point where there's nothing actually happening.
---
Look at the big dick energy on this guy
---
Takes a while it says.  U open up different parts of the vault
---
There's encrypted event and Aktos Pharma. But you know what the hardest enemy to fight is? Another player. A new game mode just released for PvP. There's your content, champ. Go get wrecked.
---
Battle royal last person standing wins. 
---
No logic needed.
---
It is the epitome of sublimity, a veritable universal panacea.
---
But how is it?
---
Honestly, "essential NPCs" is one of the most frustrating changes Bethesda has made to their games. I remember how damn _cool_ it was in Morrowind when you would get the "With this character's death, the thread of prophesy has been severed..." message. Yeah, you might have to go back to an old save (unless you knew the "back door" route to the main quest) but just knowing that you had the choice, that you could say "Fuck it!" to a storyline like that...it was empowering in a way that later games have never been able to recapture.
---
Your rank is associated with what you can access in the vault. It requires a rank ten overseer rank to go into the office iirc.
---
I think for the preview they're doing for this mode they made it so only group was available for whatever reason, but according to datamined voicelines, solo is mentioned along with grouping up. So if you want solo, you'll have to wait until they reintroduce it.
---
Todd and his team didn't do anything on Fallout 76. They're working on Starfield.
---
Fallout 76 is currently being lead by it's own team down in Texas.
---
They‚Äôre actually adding random billboards but you can always like put your neon letters over them and stuff - I‚Äôve seen people do that with the gas sign
---
FAKE APOLOGY
---
If he really wanted to apologize. he would remove the Repair Kits from the store and admit that they broke their promise to us to keep the store about Cosmetic enhancements only..
---
That's a typical Sorry/Not Sorry from your Corporate America
---
To be certain I make myself clear.
---
REMOVE THE REPAIR KITS! STOP BREAKING YOUR PROMISES! RETURN TO YOUR HONESTY!
---
REMOVE THE REPAIR KITS!
---
I don't know what triggered you so bad but like I said if that issue is enough for you to stop playing there are much worse things in the game and really you should just not waste your time. There are other games to play.
---
Sounds like a prequel to vault 76 opening then.
---
Auto grenade launcher needs lots of love. 40mm Ammo is heavy and expensive yet the damage is less than a legendary gatling, I‚Äôve never seen anyone use them.
---
I reeeaaaly hope they can get Malcolm McDowell as John Henry Eden to come back. Maybe some sort of power struggle between the ZAX and MODUS to trigger the personality emergence.
---
Even if it's not full on Eden for lore reasons, I just want patriotic tunes and McDowell's voice floating around the wasteland.
---
Dude it‚Äôs freaking documented on Sony‚Äôs website. Anyways not here to argue. Peace.
---
Wait. Human NCPs are coming? This is a revolutionary idea. Dropping a game then years later actually developing a storyline. Well done Bethesda. Bravo.
---
Yes until the last 2 people fight it out be the overseer.
---
What was the other game you picked over Fallout?
---
You think? That‚Äôs a shame, bit of a tease!
---
457 on that two shot one, it's pretty nasty now
---
What did they change if you don't mind me asking (at work). 
---
I've already had an interesting time with the stock controls on PC, things get a bit hectic and fingers go dumb, gotten me killed a few times.
---
It's fun. I suck at it, but get a little better each time. Preying on squads engaged in combat with each other seems to be my niche right now.
---
Hm. I think I might and I see it‚Äôs 29.99 on ps store. 
---
My daughter broke my disc drive somehow so digital downloads for me until the PS5. One thing that I didn‚Äôt like were the lack of human NPCs, is it true that they are on the way?
---
Yeah. I suck at BR games too. Luckily the bulk of the overseer XP (a different XP that earns you overseer levels and rewards) is gained from just surviving.
---
Surviving for 6-7 mins gets you ~100 xp. By comparison a kill gets you 20xp.
---
I like being a stealth sniper so I was happy to simply occupy the many bushes and be patient.
---
Hey i‚Äôm interested in this too, if anyone has the answer reply to me so both of us can get the notification. I‚Äôd like to see a tracker of some  kind for wins
---
Spoken like a true fallout fan!!!!
---
What kind of improvements?
---
people must have shit themselves.. lol
---
No - Sydney Australia here so 8:18am and hard at work. Will try when back home. Hence my question.
---
Yep! It was confirmed at E3- here‚Äôs a link with the trailer : https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/byrfuz/fallout_76_official_e3_2019_wastelanders_gameplay/
---
Sadly, I predicted this.
---
Google is not your friend but you can surely find a lot about fo76 changes with it.
---
Love the new mode. Aside from the inability to move straight into another game, the only other thing I would change is to increase the amount of stamina used by jumps and disallow jumps while fatigued or add a cool down between jumps. I am already tired of people spam jumping all over like a cracked out fool while I try to shoot them.
---
Go troll elsewhere. If this minor issue is enough for OP to quit the game there are much bigger issues he is going to encounter and he will just be wasting his time trying to play again. There are plenty of other games out there that fit his needs.
---
Actually sounds quite tasty but I'd have to bribe my local zoo keeper, probably not going to happen.
---
I think it was RDR2? Or maybe it was battlefield
---
Only time will tell. Dataminers will get bits and pieces here and there, maybe a major leak.
---
Try running fullscreen rather than windowed/borderless window or vice versa.
---
What do you enjoy about it?
---
Lemme guess, it has something to do with nukes : p
---
allready tried that one :/
---
NO way muchacho, that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs fun
---
I'm a huge PvP fan in other games like destiny, titanfall etc. and a Fallout fan. But never liked the PvP in 76 because of dumb OP builds and I like my fallout to be more like rebuilding a wastland than a slaughterfest. 
---
That being said, this is probably the best execution of a merger with a BR we could have asked for. Not many bugs. Minor irritations but thats about it. I like it. And it'll keep me entertained for a little while at least.
---
Criticism is certainly valid for multiple aspects of the game, but most people who qualify as "haters" just don't like that the game exists at all.
---
Thanks for the help
---
Definitely- I run a melee / rifle build and I‚Äôm actually worse off if I use PA
---
What are the overseer level boxes? Does anyone know?
---
I could be tempted, but I've yet to see if the mode is "for me" or not yet. Fully intend to give a whirl this evening.
---
Holy shit. You‚Äôre doing like, a REALLY good job at convincing me
---
Yeah ive seen, but customisable billboards would be better in the sense that it would take less camo budget, less resources and look better then having some neons glued to a board
---
Do you mean cryptid event? If so those proc few and far in between for me. I've been strictly playing survival mode just to test my skills and to make the game more intense as for the new pvp that came out today for xbox nuclear winter, it's basically PUBG in fallout.. so that's a hard pass. My main issue is that once I reached lvl 50 it's like 2 or 3 shots can kill everything but a scorchedbeast and mirelurk queen. The game has barely any main quest missions to begin with and even fewer daily's. This game has spoiled me to the point that I dont much care for any other game but playing this game makes me feel like saitama
---
New storylines new enemies they added dungeons Got rid of 90 percent of all the bugs and working on getting rid of more player vending is a thing now backpacks and cool quests to go with it and the game is more balanced now
---
You can't swap weapons that fast, healing, ammo, weapons, armor it's in different tabs and in the heat of battle can't change them or drop them that fast
---
I love the nuke system in it. But holy shit the rad damage. No hazmat = dead puppies.
---
I agree with the sound for sure. It was throwing me all out of wack. It was fun tho! I wonder how you get the cool shit in the vault!? I want that statue!
---
UpDog
---
Dang i thought it allowed me to be overseer welp time to grind 5 more levels
---
I love this game and I really want other people to love it too. It‚Äôs still got bugs so don‚Äôt get me wrong, there will always be room for improvement but it‚Äôs come a really long way from where it was at launch
---
I was so close! I got picked off as soon as I got my 4th briefcase lol
---
I wouldn‚Äôt worry about it...I tried shooting as many as I could from my Fatman, and even stuffed a few in a grenade launcher, but I simply could not win the game.  They‚Äôre convenient sometimes but do not waste your money on them believing they will help you win.
---
Really? I'll have to check it out
---
What do you have it on?
---
Definitely the mire, it gets the darkest there and it‚Äôs got a natural spooky vibe
---
What do you get for winning? Extra XP?
---
Well lets cross our fingers for outer worlds, heard everyone is killable.
---
That took me so many server hops in so many caps spent fast traveling to find and after I finally found it I run into that darn tourist two or three times randomly so frustrating..
---
Huh, that does sound bizarre
---
And I *do* like the game. I never stopped playing. But I just can't stand the fact that people are letting Bethesda get away with their shit.
---
I do t know about the rewards, but if you enter the atomic shop you can ‚Äúfavorite‚Äù an outfit for NW
---
I am on Xbox since I don‚Äôt have a decent pc
---
It always bothers me seeing vending machines with crazy prices too. The only thing in mine that I would consider overpriced is supposed to be, as a joke. I've got a plan for the Single Action Revolver Ivory Grip sitting in my vendor for 20k caps. Waiting for the memelord who ends up picking that one up.
---
I wish they‚Äôd let you set up your own radio station. You could record your own lines to be broadcast and maybe you could go and find old lps or tapes in the wasteland that you could play on your radio station you‚Äôve set up. It would be super fun to scan for people‚Äôs unique stations and it would be super fun to make your own station. I can only wish.
---
Only when you enter to the session of someone.
---
Yes the actual weapons class are buffed. missile launcher and fat man were quite underpowered and needed it
---
I see where you‚Äôre coming from! Does give some room to be creative too tho
---
Stating a simple fact is hardly being a dick about it. Being a dick would be going off on some ridiculous tirade about how this is the worst thing to happen ever and will somehow destroy the game, the entire FO series, and possibly gaming in its entirety while simultaneously insulting anyone who likes the idea. I just have no interest in pvp at all so while I'm looking forward to Wastelanders NW is a skip for me.
---
I don't think you get actual containers,  but rather the containers you encounter in game have better loot as you rank up said containers.  Just my theory though
---
Yeah, you just have to go to the outfits you own in the atomic shop, and it gives you a new option to ‚ÄúNW favorite‚Äù an outfit
---
I had no expectations for how it would be, I don‚Äôt usually play any BR type games and very rarely do I jump into survival mode. But this mode is really fun and glad they made it. Thought I would try it at least 1 time when the servers came back up just to see what it was like and then jump into adventure.. well 5 hours later I still haven‚Äôt got to adventure üôÉ
---
You removing the message on the post (that you haven't played it) frankly explains that you don't even know what you're saying. I'm done with this stupid conversation.
---
You dont keep your passives anyway - str 15 guy has the same carry capacity as str 1 guy. Same for perception and endurance.
---
You can only slot one perk card per SPECIAL. These ARE limited by your stats. So someone with PER 1 can't slot the 3 point commando skill.
---
I dont know what the most expensive perk card is - I have only seen ones that cost 3 as the most expensive but there may well be costlier ones
---
Just won my first as well, fun ass game type!
---
I'm really happy you enjoyed yourself Krannex! This is something I've looked forward too and am glad it's here!(I've posted about and commented about Fallout BR for a long time and this sub have given me downvotes everytime. I don't think they are against the idea of it and won't be playing it, just that it is trendy and very group think to hate on fo76 and the options it provides)
---
You can change your controls in settings before tue match begins. Just fyi
---
Yes please! Also, please some sort of reference to GNR or maybe a character simply named Dog in referance to Threeeee Dog owwww.
---
You go to the clothing in the atomic shop and equip it in the lobby
---
Yeah i just think it would be cool, saves having loads of camos with all the same billboard in each one too
---
What about my post illustrates that I did not think there was plenty of valid criticism of the game and how they handled certain things?
---
Never a better time tbh! Tons of new things happening right now!
---
 Noooo, you seem like such a cool guy and now we can‚Äôt play lol
---
Oh I said it was xbox at the beginning of the post. No worries. My wife and two buddies don't have this issue and we're all on xbox.
---
Press enter on pc or if on console press whatever it says at the bottom when you hover over the outfit in the atomic shop
---
For those of you still searching. To find the demos category you need to scroll all the way to the right on the free tab.
---
No need to apologise. Honestly it could just be the fact that this happened at all and my own experiences with feedback feeling like it goes into a void that is rubbing me the wrong way here.
---
Cring normy, xD
---
Go to the atomic shop. When you find apperal you want to wear there is a new NW favorite butto. When your favorite the item it will be equipped in NW. You can check by seeing the atom bomb by the outfit. 
---
The rewards at the lower level overseers ranks so far. Are player icons. And stash boxs so far. I'm level 7 overseer.
---
Haha well thank you - I try to be as chill as possible. But even if we can‚Äôt play - there‚Äôs always reddit. Reddit never changes
---
This could be. I haven‚Äôt noticed an increase in loot yet though
---
Which are disabled in Survival mode. 15 strength has no effect on melee damage.
---
Its a zax computer so sounds like a simulation, cant say for sure though
---
It's principle at play here..
---
They did something they expressly indicated they would not do... They then sat there bald faced and ignored the very people they addressed when saying they wouldn't do what they did.
---
Then they come out with this "apology".. "Heartfelt" and now everybody wants to be a sympathizer.
---
FUCK THAT.  I say "Never Forget" "Never Forgive" They need to be held to their promise.  Then I'll start playing again and take then at their "Apology"
---
&gt;*Rubs Nipples* We're sorry..... *Lays on bearskin run naked while rubbing nipples* We're really... really, sorry...
---
The image that appears in this post is of two historic buildings in the town I grew up in, which is in the south of New Zealand. Why?
---
It's a fun change of pace but I'd like some improvement in the vault section. It's fun running around but there's not much to do other than reading the terminals.
---
Idk if i reading the screen wrong or something but if I'm not mistaken it mentions rewards after the match is over on the level up screen
---
The reason I still dislike this game is that I shouldn‚Äôt pay full price for a game that may or may not get better 1-2 years later. 
---
It‚Äôs great that it‚Äôs finally half decent, so I can probably see myself playing the game once they add a story, NPCs, mods, etc (all things I think should have been in any Fallout game on release)
---
I jumped on a few weeks ago: the game seems to have come a ways since the Angey Joe and Laymen Gaming reviews. Glad to see more content is coming.
---
FFS!!!
---
We played for one year, hell yeah we count.
---
Yeah we could definitely use some variety - a lot of camps do look the same these days. Nice posh little brick houses with resort items inside. Meanwhile I‚Äôm over here in my shit shack just playin my banjo
---
Your comment is like a pizza cutter. All edge and no point.
---
No issues here
---
You can get hazmat suits.
---
I second this.also if you'd be able to list how to access them as well.like the crates you win at certain ranks
---
u/Valseek u/LadyDevann
---
Yep, this post right here officers. This idea is too good
---
I‚Äôve tried other battle royale type games and I‚Äôve never liked them. I‚Äôm also horrible at them. But this one I actually like! It‚Äôs probably just because it‚Äôs more familiar to me, but I‚Äôve been having fun with it. I like that there‚Äôs also the ‚Äúfear‚Äù of being attacked by other creatures instead of just players.
---
On ps4 its only 68 GB :)
---
How to i claim stash boxes?
---
Rank 6 and counting... sorry
---
I understand. I liked it right off the bat. But get where you're coming from. Every survival mmo starts pretty bare and gets better as more shit ks added. They dont all cost 60 bucks though. I've gotten my mo exa worth though
---
Two shot explosive flamethrowing supersledge still the best god tier weapon?
---
By far my favorite game
---
I wasn't aware of that. I've seen the technical data a lot and I run to pick it up, and wondered where it even came from in the first place.
---
They really should start adding stuff like that into the game. one of my favourite things about the fallout series was wandering around listening to somebody ramble about the happenings of the wasteland.
---
But Reddit... has changed. Subreddits fight over dominance with memes. Pushing their ideologies to just troll one another in hopes that their meme reaches the front page and boast their internet points. It‚Äôs no longer about coming together in harmony. Reddit... has changed
---
Mine was only like 5.4
---
Oh no I want a stuffed mothman
---
Well done Overseer!
---
Yeah it‚Äôs definitely way too weak, I think it‚Äôs more of a burden to use as it‚Äôs loud and makes you a bigger target so I usually just let my teammates take it.
---
https://discord.gg/3KHSuz
---
That‚Äôs the link to a FO76 minutemen discord group. I believe they have a subreddit as well
---
I volunteer to be radio host. 
---
"Good day to you all vault dwellers out there, today we are going to lay down some saucy tunes. Now dont let these jamming tunes distract you, plenty of messed up stuff out there to look out for. And now a shout out from the overseer. *plays back audio* "help oh god im surrounded. Someone. Can anyone hear me? Please"... wait a minute...
---
I stopped playing because I wanted to play a VATS pistol build, but the game doesn't feel balanced enough for that style of play.
---
Or, maybe I got drunk and blew on hookers and blow.
---
From what I understand, there was a way to dupe items using the punch bowl. 
---
I know I accidentally doubled my bourbon and whiskey a few times.
---
Hooray me, I played a video game.
---
PvP or PvE? Or are you looking for an all arounder? Automatic Rifles/ Rifles is pretty meta right now. You stack with criticals and perception not much any one can do while at a distance. 
---
Heavy weapons are also good. They have highest dps in the game. They just suffer from inaccuracy. That and it costs alot of time to use the ammo. 
---
Rifles for PvP. Heavy weapon for PvE content. 
---
Some melee weapons such as the meat hook can benefit from both one handed and empty handed perks. Zero need for ammo and little repair too. I‚Äôd say if you want most power, find a Bloodied version and give it a try.
---
Do perk cards stay after each round? Or every rounds starts at 0?
---
It does take up a sizable amount of room if you look at it in the build menu
---
6 people died it didn't count though cause I died
---
This is really as much fun as I've had playing 76 except for maybe Fasnacht. It will probably be fun for longer than Fasmacht too!
---
Hey, everyone forgot Destiny fuck ups when TTK. The only reason I didn‚Äôt keep playing that trash is because they started charging for DLC after saying they would not, and then they locked me out of content because I never bought it. Bethesda hasn‚Äôt locked me out of any content yet, but I‚Äôm sure they will after waste landers; ‚Äúyes, we said free DLC, not a free expansion‚Äù is what they will say. People will downvote you for speaking the truth, but you‚Äôre absolutely right, we BETA tested for one whole year and gave them feedback on how to improve. They listened, Bungie did not; so here I am still playing this ‚Äúnot-so-bad‚Äù game, but in reality, it was never that bad. Just bad publicity.
---
&gt;while I refuse to get my hopes up, I also refuse to completely abandon hope altogether.
---
I pretty much feel the same way/
---
I know synth tech is centuries away, but I‚Äôd love a Rose/Rosalyn synth to run around with.
---
Pretty sure they start with some small boosts without mods.
---
No Setting For FOV on Console yet srry
---
It‚Äôs almost as if you never had doubts about a game but then had a friend show you the light
---
Nice! I haven't tried it yet, let's see how it goes.
---
That .50 Cal is the absolute best weapon. Unless you can land a solid headshot with some of the scoped rifles, that 50 will win you the match.
---
Warm and server with ice cold Nukashine
---
2 teams*
---
Do you have your Nukashine ready?
---
Found a good legendary pitchfork last night, gonna put a flame mod on it, buy that vaultboy helmet, put my red tactical light on it, and wear the blackbird xo-1 armor.
---
I‚Äôll be the stuff of nightmares
---
The only thing i feel is OP at the moment is whoever seems to get PA seems to be almost invincible. That also may be because I've died to many PA folks so far üòÇ
---
But yeah, like I said, this really feels like what you'd expect in a Fallout Battle Royale mode. Literally anything as a weapon and you have to watch the dangers of random creatures attacking you, along with other players. I'm diggin' it.
---
Hopefully there's more than 1 raider faction and one settler faction. Like separate gangs or chapters.
---
I mean i had to uninstall and reinstall my game for the game to update.(I have done 2 fresh installs at least to try and combat this.) As it has been since beta. I can launch the game ONCE per an install before it forces me to find it in the folder. I crashed twice trying to eat and drink a unique bug that has been a random weekly occurrence. For some reason my Grognak's axe vanished after doing 2 rounds of the new battle royale. Within that battle royale as i load into the screen i notice others are already opening chests. Seems a bit weird to allow people that ability in an arena. My teammate had two crashes in a row just earlier. We have been server dc'd twice.
---
That was just today. So yeah its not nearly as bad but i am pretty surprised they are offering a free week and preview to something they seemingly are unsure how to make stable.
---
Agreed.
---
Level up and explore it. Stuff starts to open at level 10
---
Still can use them as cannon fodder. Lol.
---
Hopefully you in enjoy it, it was a blast! If you play on pc we can play together.
---
Yeah, the other creatures surprised the hell out of me the first time I played. To the point that I accidentally shot and exploded a car next to a mutant hound and a split second later realized "Oh, I don't have Fireproof and this car is gonna kill me."
---
I def think starting with a new character would be good. A different way to experience those lower levels
---
Invite them to team trough social menu while in main screen
---
GOOD NEWS EVERYONE!!!!!
---
Vault 51 in Adventure Mode is still a buildable  area as of 6:32pm EST. I am here right now and am able to place a Camp!
---
On a side note, does anyone know how to get apparel in the BR?  I see a handful of people with stuff on in the vault before the game starts but I can't find anyway to get my own. I have stuff that I've gotten from the atom shop but my character doesn't spawn with anything.
---
Lucky I haven't found the breifcase once. Got all 4 cards multiple times but no briefcase
---
Being a Mass Effect fan, I wish to god EA had stuck by Andromeda and fixed shit. They started to, then collectively shrugged their shoulders and walked away. They could have salvaged it and saved the game through updates and fixes, instead they just gave a collective middle finger at the entire community.
---
No matter how mad I'd been at Bethesda, at least they've stood by their product. They worked to fix it, improve it, and make it into a much better game.
---
Rectifying mistakes is good. Shredding your goodwill and benefit of the doubt because you keep releasing broken unfinished games with the same bugs that other fallouts launched with as well and brushing it off like that‚Äôs their MO so it‚Äôs cute, isn‚Äôt.
---
I know right!! It‚Äôs hard enough to get the robot to spawn...
---
They're player icons
---
It probably stems from lack of personal items and CAMPs.
---
I was lucky to find some and still died, though to a person also in power armor so I think it needs a *tad* more balancing, not a whole lot.
---
I sorta screamed and my boyfriend just died laughing at my reaction! I had no idea that a scorchbeast could appear!!
---
Never had this happen. Stop being rude to new players
---
I wouldn‚Äôt know...lol.  I have no idea who works on what.  I just addressed it that way since he addressed the public on behalf of past missteps last night.
---
I've never seen this. Steam also have problems  occasionally. I could the suspect would be you don't restarted after install launcher (before install fo76). Do you friends have this problem? I could suggest uninstall launcher, restart, install launcher, restart, install fo76. If you have archives in /ProgramFiles(x86)/BethesdaLauncher/games/ could copy them in other folder in order to backup. But I think you lose you progress on close the launcher first. Also could check preferences on antivirus and firewall.
---
Imagine bootlicking a proven liar. Yikes.
---
You can level up your character in a perk card screen, similar to BR mode, when playing in Adventure mode. The first rewards, including Medium crate and Epic crate are C.A.M.P items. So by deploying your C.A.M.P, you can build them. In the C.A.M.P building mode, in Adventure, you can also save blueprints of structures before queuing for BR. Once you are in a BR game, just select the blueprint after deploying your C.A.M.P.
---
Atomic Shop's *NW favorite* button appears only on apparels that you own.
---
I played the beta and have played it ever since. I have 390 hours into. Yup i had doubts alright. Just stop lol
---
The other issue I had is that it wasn‚Äôt a Fallout game. Like I wouldn‚Äôt have minded a new IP that was an MMO, but it felt like it was simply taking advantage of a beloved IP name.
---
You can check to see if its in the atom shop. It should say owned if you have unlocked it. If it says owned you can craft them in your owned workshops and camps. It will just be under the stash box option.
---
Source: im playing right now
---
Literally nothing in your OP says anything about valid criticism, and reads exactly like a fanboys post. Having read some of your replies to other people(after my first two comments were posted) you seem a little more level headed, although still leaning on the fanboy side of the spectrum. And that's fine btw, you do you. Just don't be surprised when you make a post that appears to be fanboying by the title and OP, and people call you out for it.
---
I will never stop asking other people‚Äôs opinions on video games
---
Agreed. I have no problem finding aid/buff items. Radaway is a bit more rare but that‚Äôs fine in such a short game mode
---
The Adventure Zone is sooooo gooood.
---
I think they list those things in the patch notes..
---
Im terribly sorry I havent got any links...
---
Try putting a porta potty down somewhere inconspicuous in the middle of the map and hide in it.  I win every time.
---
There will be all [kinds](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6lu7jIlXd5clSzKJ23Inza/atomic-shop-patch-10-items-and-sales) throughout the week.
---
Also laser weapons do some good damage to my surprise! Definitely stick with your team mates!
---
üò≠üò≠
---
Savage.
---
did you try through the game's Atom store?
---
We need some enclave radio up In here
---
I found it a blast so far. Fights feel fair, not one shot killed. I like BR but they usually cause me too much stress and this doesn't do that. My probs so far are teamspeak not working or happening, also I need to get good at fav wheel, it is difficult in this mode
---
i dont think you can couldnt figure it out
---
Yeah a prompt to be thrown into another lobby on the death screen would be great.
---
On the top right of the map, you see a gauge telling you how close the fire is. What color do you guys see? I‚Äôm not going to mention the color I see because it might influence your answer, but, which is the ‚Äúsafe‚Äù square for you guys ?
---
With both mutations? Damn that's almost negligible.
---
Well done for releasing a broken game and fixing it in real time when you could have just delayed it a year and released it all at once, in ‚Äúworking‚Äù order relative to bethesda games and not ruined their reputation.
---
I don‚Äôt see anything about fixing sliding enemies or enhancing the perk system by letting you create/save decks, so I couldn‚Äôt give less of a shit about this patch.
---
GREAT idea.
---
I almost never use power armor.
---
Oh nice, I'll just grab Eagle Eyes to offset the change. Thanks!
---
Mark it as favorite in the atom shop.
---
I believe you can unlock be cosmetic items to be used in any mode, as well as earning XP and caps for that character.
---
You have to invite them from the main menu by opening the social tab
---
I actually like the raw feeling of the gun play. It feels old school. No one is jumping around dodging bullets.
---
Are there any members of the dev team playing as well??
---
It sucks going into these threads and seeing people praise Todd. Talk about Stockholm syndrome. He gets to mentally abuse you and lie to you but his company fixes the stuff that should be and needs to be fixed and everyone forgets he‚Äôs lied through his teeth since 76 was announced.
---
There already is, a couple players hooked up the other day on adventure mode and exchanged numbers.
---
Which is always broken for me.
---
yup, they seem to be tagged as an armor peice, when you equip any armor that isnt the vault suit the cosmetic unequips
---
Yeah I agree with you( long time bf player) but I am having alot of fun with it.
---
I had some lag while firing laser weapons as top 3 squad while we were all getting blasted by scorchbeasts, not complaining, but the lag cost me the game.
---
It wouldn‚Äôt let me even move on the main screen after you select NW! It is frustrating!
---
What u said to the other guy wasnt an asking for a opinon. It was being an ass.
---
I was curious how they would integrate nukes, so its not a silo run...good to know.
---
Wow, way to be a dick. Go troll somewhere else.
---
Anytime dude. If you ever need a group to party with just hit me up lXl Luckie lXl is my gt!
---
I run an unarmed melee/rifle build, and find I rarely need PA. SBQ fights mostly occur in non-radiated areas outside the nuke zone. If I need to go into a nuke zone (like a nuked Whitesprings),  I toss on PA, and equip a melee weapon. Many of the unarmed perks also work for melee (incisor, martial artist), strength, and twisted muscles also works for both.
---
You need a better PC.
---
Yeah with this patch a bunch of bugs....my guy doesn't move, an enemy's can just pound me. Controls continuously are disabled, reload matrix doesnt work. Rubberband. Its definitely not my internet. Ohhhh an shut my controller off an its fully charged, an even at that I have the cord plugged into PS4....I don't mind you all trying to attract the attention of the kids audience with the fortnite update but damn...you all knew this mode was coming, an laggy buggy controls should NEVER be an issue..But...I love 76 an will continue too..just fix this
---
There‚Äôs a nice spot I used to be at overlooking monoga by a closed mine. There is a lead deposit too
---
I think it auto kicks you after a certain amount of time after you die. Not sure if the rest of your team also needs to die for that to happen though
---
hey sick thanks boss, what do you guys do and is it very active?
---
If one merely looks at my post, you‚Äôll see that I was asking for an opinion. He came into my house with disrespect so I fired back
---
Hell fucking yes
---
If you want the imposter sheepsquatch event you can always start it yourself, its repeatable if you have the caps to buy the recall circuit board after you do the quest. Also nuke areas other than white springs and see what happens. I thought I was tough till a 3* legendary level 70 something glowing yogi and his friend put me in my place lol
---
I've been having an alright time with all of that, but you have to pay attention to setting up your Favorites and knowing what is where so that when you get into a fight you can switch to what you need fast enough
---
Agree 100. I tend to get one shot by people I don't see. Also fight happen so rarely even if you are looking for them. This mode is like OK fight! And so far it feels fair enough
---
If it has that little energy flash by its damage I would think so. But don't we have show numbers on dmg option now? I have not played for a week due to working full time and taking 8 creds of summer college (yikes!). I suppose you could compare the differences.
---
This just made my day honestly.  Because I totally understand the principle and felt one way about it and then another.  I think actually there are several competing principles at play and that is my issue because I agree with you totally about if you say something, you should do it, and if you can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt then provide an explanation but at least acknowledge the change.  The explanation can be satisfactory or not, that‚Äôs a whole different issue.   But yeah, thanks for the laugh while making a good point.
---
Major reason I ask is because say you're in the last fight, why would any one person on either team risk dying for the sake of the team winning if that means they won't get credit for winning if they die? Hopefully someone has experienced this and can give solid info.
---
Wheres my Fusion Generator skins at?
---
Just.. why can‚Äôt you people search? Every third post is someone asking if it‚Äôs time to return. There are even default "should I return?" Posts and wiki pages to try and combat this.
---
Complaining about what should be in a proper Fallout game in a Bethesda made Fallout game is dumb, buddy.  
---
On top of that, it has nothing to do with what I said. If you want to access Vault 51 content, you have to play the Battle Royal mode since that is where the Vault 51 content is located. I don't know what you expected.
---
Im not trying to be mean
---
I‚Äôve stayed away from the game since launch for obvious reason. Was considering giving it a try since it‚Äôs a free trial and they said the game has massively improved.
---
However, you just convinced me otherwise. The game has been out since November, 8 months. If it is still having the same core performance issues since launch, that‚Äôs a good enough reason to stay away. So many other games I can play that at least run well.
---
I put shine in my shop by flatwoods every chance I get for 1 cap seems to have the same result
---
What a stupid post.
---
Game is fine on my end. Just some lag now and then
---
So.... read the patch notes
---
You pick your perks in the pre-match hub area in Vault 51.
---
They don't reset though so you will have the same set of cards each match until you change them.
---
You get new perk cards for leveling up in this mode as well.
---
I had the same problem on my ssd. I think that ,even if the game is 66 gb,it ask you to have like the sum of all patches available.
---
Maybe you could transfer it to a bigger hard disk to do the update,then back to where you want it.
---
Trust yourself, you should know what kind of games you like by now. Looking toward someone telling you whether something is good or bad is always going to leave a predisposition based on what you're told rather than what you experience. 
---
Games have always had issues, I mean.. always. Game breaking bugs that stop you from progressing, duplication glitches, etc. Halo 2 had glitches where you could bounce off the ground and fly off into places you weren't supposed to go.some of the newer pokemon games have duplication glitches where you can copy items. Games where you could get stuck in an autosave that had an unwinnable fight because you didn't have enough items stocked up. There are plenty more examples that you probably didn't notice because those are single player games, so you're much less likely to come into contact with them unless you're seeking them out.
---
It's fun but clunky.  No good way to trade, or signal what you have.  Or that you need something.  The Radium Rifle is obnoxious .  Not because it's so strong but because getting shot by it griefs the crap out of your game, so even if you win the fight there's almost no way you have enough rad away to be functional.  Spawn system is not my favorite but I'll get used to it.   
---
At the end of the day it's an extra BR mode to the fallout game we love.  Not a stand alone BR game.  And it feels like it.  All this coming from a Cod/BR guy with 1000+ wins in fortnite and another 100+ in blackout.
---
I'm talking solely of the BR mode, the thing is if I want to favorite something have togo to 3-4 clicks to get that gun I just found on the ground
---
Ayy thank you. We could not figure it out
---
Not really because they still allow damage stack with chems and bobble heads that can boost dps so much you can down someone in a couple of seconds. Which wouldn't be to bad but stim packs stop the healing effect the moment you take damage so needing the DPS to out damage someone spamming stimpacks isn't there.
---
I agree, not complaining about the mechanics in adventure mode. But for pvp or br in this case, you just want everything to work smoothly; fps, controls, aiming etc. It‚Äôs indeed all very clunky. Feels like playing Counter strike back in 2001 again ;)
---
Why do you say that, am I not allowed to state my opinion
---
Glad its opening so I can shove boots down the throats of those raider scum. #NeverForgetSummersvilleDam
---
You get new perk cards too, right?
---
someones a little salty beth is getting good winter reviews...
---
Are these perks all new? Or some old ones with the new ones?
---
Fed 4 Rank 1 Nukashine when I seen they joined. The funny part was where they ended up, they never complained. Found it real funny
---
Running ultra settings on fo76 isn‚Äôt completely optimized. Put shadow distance (or quality i cant remember) on low and then you should see higher frames. You wont be able to tell the difference in the change
---
Don‚Äôt listen to one person. How would he even know unless he is still playing. He‚Äôs trolling.
---
Tried it. Nothing at all like a Fallout game. As for 'battle royale' ... well, the kindest thing I can say about it is "that gets old very quick".
---
That's sounds great
---
Those are Stash box skins for adventure mode
---
Heck, I'll voice him for free if you write for free! Even got a decent mic setup.
---
It's novel. Im getting farmed non-stop.
---
I‚Äôve played fortnite, PUBG, and apex, but so far I find this one to be the most enjoyable
---
Wait rly, Is it because if so i wanna hop back on
---
Ah yes, both are great games for the collection, I own both of them, but 76 won't disappoint you. All I play is 76 and the players you meet are just really good caring people who just wanna help out if asked. It's a full on RPG game playing with real time players from all around the world and the monster you fight can be pretty out of it. I mean if me n u were to team up and you were the leader of the group I would see all of your missions you have to do and I can see and hear everything u can. With all the updates coming soon it's gonna be in my opinion one of the best games I will own!. Go get it and get ur friends to get it too. The games heaps better playing with freinds and it's fun by yourself too.
---
That may have been me, was it in a nuked area?
---
I wonder if you could go and find another camera to repair and use. Maybe you need to activate the quest in the pipboy again?
---
Can't upvote this enough! We need to show then that there is more to the wasteland than one hit kills. But on another note I fully support the lite hearted troll storys I've been reading.
---
It is glitched then, hopefully they look into it soon.
---
I'm also talking about the BR mode, yeah.
---
It's a little clunky, but it's something you need to set up before you get into a fight, and I'm sure we'll all get more used to it as we practice.
---
You just kinda have to know, wish they made a list but the first couple rewards are stash box skins and perk cards
---
Thanks for the psa!
---
By the down votes and my own tries clearly I was incorrect
---
There are new perk cards, but they are only for Nuclear Winter.
---
The queue times not my problem, i feel like we just spend too much time in the vault before the game in general. Its always at least 2 minutes.  I think thats regardless of how many people are trying to play, because theres areas in the vault that unlock as your level goes up.  So they give you 2 minutes to explore it all
---
ok thank you
---
I believe the gameplay itself isn't canon, the vault terminals + holotapes are.
---
What platform are you on? It‚Äôs certainly not as active as it used to be, compared to the earlier days after launch. But I think the PS4 and PC players are a little more active than the Xbox players. 
---
It‚Äôs a lot of just helping each other out, grouping up for stuff, etc. I‚Äôm on Xbox, and I personally am open to helping anyone in need
---
I honestly would trade 50k caps in a heart beat if it would let me respec.
---
I ended up moving rocket league(8gb)to a different drive and it let me download the 2.5ish gb patch. So maybe it's just a graphical error that goes away once you clear enough space for the patch. Still should be fixed though, or at least tell us how big the patch download is in the launcher itself so we know how much space to clear without having to look it up every time
---
[I don‚Äôt have a way to award you silver, but take this ](https://me.me/i/or-jo-youre-a-great-person-and-hope-you-have-18508020)
---
There was a pretty in depth post about this. 
---
Think basically it was set it at the medium preset, lower lighting distance, don't touch the draw distances. Something like that. 
---
I never got the boost the post claimed, but I did get a bit more stable performance/less FPS drops. It still happens frequently however, I'm not so sure specs make a lick of difference past a certain point.
---
Yeah thats how its always been, you'd think they'd fix it by now but if its just their servers then they should get new ones
---
I'm on PC my guy, thanks a lot for the info it's much appreciated. Is there a place to go to find clans and communities?
---
Its related to your rank. For example you will need rank 10 overseer in order to access the overseers office.
---
Oh yea that respec was nice, screwed up and invested in stuff that was useless like the mine, would kill to have that here.
---
Considering how fortnite takes popular features from other games watch out for nukes in fortnite coming next week
---
I'm guessing that it's to make it easier for players to determine DR/Resistances.
---
Sucks that cosmetics are only useful until we find armour, but I get why that's the case.
---
‚ÄúMounted Scoarchbeast Queens head‚Äù

Didn‚Äôt know the plans were out there. Where/how do I get them?
---
No, you‚Äôre free to say whatever you want, just like I‚Äôm free to call your opinion dumb as well.  
---
The game isn‚Äôt perfect. Broken? Absolutely fucking not. You‚Äôre just one of literally hundreds of trolls that‚Äôll be peppering this sub with dumb posts for the next week at least.

"Yeah the 60$ game sucked in November, they straight up lied to us about the collectors edition, the beta literally deleted itself, the quests and crafting system were broken, PCWorld was actually unable to review the game because of how broken it was, it had(s) more bugs than a picnic in July, a patch released in January actually caused *more* bugs than it fixed, but 8 months later it's a solid game so that's good!"
---
But Todd Howard made some joke onstage about criticism and Bethesda showed us a feel-good video about the community, so it's OK they knowingly released a broken game, charged us full price for it and shoved in micro transactions for good measure. 
---
Oh, but of course the Atom shop has worked absolutely perfectly since launch day, so that's good right?
---
Step 1: Open Skyrim
---
Step 2: Chop wood

Step 3: ????

Step 4, PROFIT
---
I hate battle Royal. Hate fortnite. Hate Call of Duty. Hate PUBG. Mainly because I have never had an interest in just running and gunning against other people.
---
I gave this a chance because I love fallout. 
---
I have to say.... Much to my surprise.... I absolutely love this mode.
---
May have to give the other games a chance now, lol.
---
Since its BR I would expect power armor is the new version of 'sheild' so it stands to reason it would dissapear just as quickly. Only way for it to not be OP
---
So is this mode only temporary or is it here to stay?
---
Same here, happened in the middle of a 2v2 and I‚Äôm on xbox
---
Oh okay thanks
---
Yeah, I'm not saying it's perfectly balanced or anything like that, just that it makes the PVP combat we are used to seeing look pretty ridiculous to be honest. A lot of people defend it by saying there are counters to different builds etc but that doesn't mean it's good or shouldn't be changed as I think NW clearly demonstrates.
---
I Just Played Today :)
---
Caps and XP character. Cosmetics account.
---
That‚Äôs a pretty lame justification if that‚Äôs the one thing you have to point at. But oh well, have fun enabling the creation of shitty games. If we never get a decent Fallout again, I‚Äôll know who to point the finger at.
---
Do your have all the mats?

---
He said nothing disrespectful. U are asking for people to tell u what to think. Dont you have a brain? Get ur own opinion. Just because people hate it doesnt mean you will. If people love it doesnt mean u will
---
Serious question, console?
---
PC
---
It's a completely different system, so you'll have to make sure you read up. Even the perks that come over are a bit different.
---
i7-6700K, 32GB Ram, 2080Ti FE I consistently run at or around 100fps @ 3440x1440, everything cranked max, FOV 90. FO76 is one of the less demanding games ime as well for my rig - you should be rolling much better imo. Not sure what to tell you - did you make any changes to your prefs file for anything? I've seen presets that can put the hurt on by doing that. Hope it's something simple! Hate it when games don't run well like that - oh I mean, on the outset, you could try validating your game files.... but, probably not going to do the trick.
---
I Have Loved and cherished this game, Im Not Trolling I promise
---
Your experience is very unique and obviously not the norm. Are you doing a standard install without changing any of the settings?
---
From what I have seen they are either new or are variations of the same ones that have been reworked to work in Battle Royale.
---
&gt;they're adding them because people demanded them
---
I am pretty sure that all of this years content was planned out long before release, that is the nature of corporate bureaucracy. and saying that, i am pretty sure 2020 is already planned and under development and people complaining is going to have little effect on the fundamentals of the expansions
---
Ok then I‚Äôll stop having fun with my game I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt realise it was upsetting you
---
But if you load in late you are invisible for a minute or two which is good balancing imho
---
As in im playing rn
---
raider station hosted by raiders and or rose
---
Developers that care don't knowingly release broken games to the public, lie about collector's edition contents, introduce bugs in patches, etc. etc. etc.
---
It almost sounds like you have some access control issues within your windows environment.
---
I'm positive this has nothing to do with the game, so I'd start with steam support. The big picture overlay is a bit buggy, but you'll have to use it if you want to use all of the features the steam controller, or any other controller, has with steam.
---
When working as expected, you should get the big picture in-game overlay without launching the game while in big picture, you just have to make sure your controller is connected and the game should launch with the big picture in-game overlay.
---
This more than likely means you don't have to materials to repair the weapon in question. If you hit the repair button it should pull up a menu showing what items you have and what you are missing as well as giving you the option to tag them for search.
---
Ok Im Not trying to Convince you to stop playing it im just giving you a heads up
---
I‚Äôve seen a few jokes and I get a laugh all the time!
---
Awesome thanks! Probably something they should have put on that intro terminal lol.
---
raiders rise up. this is our chance
---
Right. Alternatively stop releasing beta software to the public if you don‚Äôt want eviscerated.
---
Asking for an opinion isn‚Äôt asking people to tell me what to think. People ask for opinions for video games all the time in similar fashions. Saying that I‚Äôm coming in and just shitting on a game is rude and disrespectful. Having the audacity to say such things clearly shows that the man has big dick energy
---
Every online game has lag! Atleast on xbox. So ain't nothing that's gonna be perfect, ever so just deal with it and quit complaining in post that aren't on the official forums. It's never gonna be perfect, and it isnt that big a deal most the time anyway. It's just the way every Bethesda game has been, always has a few hiccups. And I'll admit launch was a failure but it's a million times better now.
---
I'm with you, I'm actually pretty pleased that the NW gameplay rewards knowing the area well, feels like a little reward for all of the time I've put into the game in Adventure Mode
---
Yeah, 'Let's have 20 new Minigun and Missilie Launcher skins, and none for the Gatling!' 'Great idea, Jim, let's do that!'
---
I‚Äôm just going to get them addicted to drugs and alcohol.
---
Yea, so don‚Äôt scare people away.
---
I bought fo76 knowing itll get better like no man's sky. I dont regret either purchases
---
Some old, some new, some old but adjusted.
---
You can only slot one card per SPECIAL though.
---
Example cards: 
---
1pt - do 100% more damage to creatures (yeah theres AI creatures in there). New card.
---
1pt - lock pick. Pick all locks. Adjusted card (all 3 in one)
---
3pt - bodyguards. Get +12 defenses per team mate. Old card.
---
Overseer does not work. Overseer is only puppet to its VaultTec masters.
---
I thought I read " 72 new perk cards, some of which can only be used in NW"
---
But I was working when I was reading through the patch notes
---
What platform? XBox1 here and yes it does crash sometimes. If youve played fallout4 its about like that on my platform.  I will say stability has gotten much better over the last 3 months. With the free to try  week going and them allowing us to play the new NW game mode in the same week I expect some issues.
---
I sort of agree but in my personal experience my team run into players a lot and we tend to get into more gun fights so it hard to notice that we haven‚Äôt run into any creatures.
---
You can VATS on the wild enemies scattered around, just not on other players.
---
Yeah, I felt the same way. I had to make my own content, because what gets released is just too little for me. That's what you'll have to do too, if you don't want to play the new game mode.
---
Personally, my current goal is running the "BEST SHOP EVER". The best guns armor and mods, already kitted out. The rarest outfits. All the game holotapes, ect. Try building an inventory of field jackets and leather coats, I dare you. Can you keep shielded raider leathers in stock? Can you even make them? Sold out of excavator calibrated shock legs again...  better go launch a nuke for flux. That Mr. Fuzzy suit finally sold, now you need grind tokens for another month... 
---
My shop keeps me busy 24/7. It'll probably keep me busy until Wastelanders, which is the content I'm personally interested in. If being a super shopkeeper interests you, give it a try. If not, you'll have to think of some other time consuming task.
---
JUST HAD THIS HAPPEN WHEN I WAS LAST TWO SQUADS
---
Ok, you make a valid point and im starting the game rn so I make a post Tomorrow on how i feel about it
---
I've been running heavy guns/unarmed, mostly cause surviving nuke zones without power armor is a heavy investment in perks and I prefer having a ranged option to shoot scorchbeasts out of the sky, and honestly haven't noticed a huge difference with accuracy. It's there but not crippling by any means. Just be careful with rad x cause it kills your mutations till it wears off. With adrenal reaction, twisted muscles, and talons I'm hitting 850+ at 30% health, one shot most enemy's, sneak attacks are brutal Haha.
---
oh, well thats kinda sad
---
I'm reasonably sure that they're only for NW, but I'm no expert
---
Bloodied builds are the hot ticket atm. I do a bloodied commando. I die a lot though since my armor isn‚Äôt tailored to it (or I just suck... I probably suck but it‚Äôs still a blast).
---
Literally every Battle Royal game gives you the rewards if your team goes on to win and you stay in the match spectating until the end to encourage players from instant dropping and stressing the server  
---
I don't see why Bethesda would break from the mold with their potato servers. I would assume you would get credit for where the team finally places at should you die early and remain to spectate.
---
I'd let Todd Howard mentally abuse me any day
---
Ugh.
---
That's atypical. Potentially a specs not being up to snuff issue, but hard to tell without your pc specs.
---
i play on PC. i have a feeling that this will crash often.  i will keep playing but if it keeps crashing like this i may just give up
---
Gave a nukashine to a new player once, hilarity ensued. Gave him a spot on our team after we all had a nice laugh.
---
Are you guys serious here? There's a button on the right to shut it off. They're rarely hidden that much so you can't access it
---
Currently, everyone's map marker is the same color, making it pretty confusing if more than one person on your team has a marker down
---
Psn Jimmylipps
---
I made a batch last night and gave out 7 today to people at the overseers camp
---
Never would I have ever thought I'd see people thanking Bethesda for Fallout 76. It used to be a joke but now I think they could quite literally try to sell an actual turd because there would always be at least one person thankful for it.
---
Do you have neon letters? I think patch notes said something about adjusting budget for neon signs and letters. So if they increased it, could explain why you're over budget now.
---
Wait. Human NPCs? Someone explain
---
Well, as people said, it could have to do with damage or it could be something else entirely. The game is still pretty broken even after 10 patches. In this specific case, it seemed to be a problem with a specific item but in yours it could be something else entirely.
---
If this happens to you again, feel free to contact me and we'll test things out together if that's something you'd like to do.
---
I think mine was 5gb
---
I‚Äôve been playing for a couple hours this evening. I‚Äôve never played a Battle Royale game before but was willing to give it a try. I‚Äôve played probably about a dozen matches, never did particularly well but had a lot of fun and met some new people which was great as well. I‚Äôll definitely be fitting in as much play as I can during this week.
---
i have no problem with any other games besides this one. i will try more and see if it keeps crashing
---
Pharma is way harder than sbq,try tha. Sounds like you haven't done that event
---
It is fun. I liked the style.
---
Whatever you say. Have a good day
---
Dang.
---
That's what I thought.  I'm very confused right now.
---
The more would be Soo hardcore. Or like you have to be level 30 overseer to head to the more or something
---
when you put a decontamination arch inside a normal doorway, the button is not reachable. I've seen this at a camp that was, ironically, selling a few bloodied weapons.
---
Well, I guess I'm just special and screwed. :(
---
Whoo sounds like a blast! I bet you had the time of your life! Yolo!
---
Thank you. You have a good day too. Or night. Or afternoon
---
So it's only one card but we can upgrade those and the costs of a card are meaningless? Unless of course we only had less points that allocated in a certain SPECIAL?
---
Dude, me too
---
I played a round earlier, someone launched a nuke just east of the agricultural center. The last two rings were within the fallout zone. My team had to go in without hazmat suits or RadX and with only two having RadAway. It ended up being two teams inside the zone at the end. We won by the skin of our teeth.. and by virtue of being the last one to actually enter the zone.
---
I‚Äôm not too sure about that. You could try using the search bar at the top of the FO76 subreddit (on mobile) and see if you come across any posts ‚Äúadvertising‚Äù diff groups and communities
---
rank 4 is a stash box
---
You're hired 2 thumbs up
---
this did not age well
---
You've got 7 slots, but you can equip as many of the same special perks as your special will allow. So you can have 3 strength perk cards so long as the total cost doesn't go over your strength special stat.
---
I mean Clint was already a radio host here anyway. Hire Clint and bring in Huntington (somewhere near Hillbilly Hotdogs? They already play loose with our geography. Stick Huntington across the river or something). Do quests for him to get the radio up and running and then they can have Events to change up the playlist like others have suggested.
---
NOT ENOUGH RAIDER THEMED ITEMS
---
I played a little PUBG with one of my close friends and it was ok, but this just tops all the Battle Royale mode for me. It feels the most...authentic and true to itself, I guess?
---
Is that cheating or is that just maxing out a specific build?
---
Nah it shouldn‚Äôt be level capped bc of player count but it should totally let us swamp it up. Also being attacked by a wendigo would be fun
---
I‚Äôm not even sure what you are complaining about here. Radiation works exactly as it was meant to and always has. It literally lowers maximum health points.
---
Early suspicion it's a simulation ala vault 112
---
I'm sure they are doing just fine. If this game wasn't making them money, they'd stop dumping resources into it immediately.
---
Lower the settings a notch if it's just crashing outright. Trial and error till it works without crashing.
---
Sadly theyre only profile icons. But there is unlockable styles for stash boxes
---
Should have seen it during the dbl exp week!
---
You evil bastard .... I like it.
---
The quest is entirely gone from the pip boy. I suspect I should be able to restart it by finding another camera but I'm not about to start searching for one after I already had it. If I come across one in the wild again I'll continue it, but for now I'm entirely writing off that quest and item.
---
This game is objectively horse shit compared to other Fallouts (and other games in general). Like, it‚Äôs on par with Duke Nukem Forever. A majority of the Fallout fan base wants a decent Fallout game (just look at r/Fallout if you need a source on that one) but if Bethesda keeps making money off of this shit, it will become the norm, and that‚Äôs not okay. I‚Äôve been a Fallout fan since the first game and I have plenty of friends who are as well. None of us play 76 anymore. I don‚Äôt know a single person who does because we all know that it‚Äôs just downright awful. Even Todd Howard had to apologize at E3 because he knew it was shit. He says they deserved the criticism for putting out a half-assed game. 
---
If you want this to be the norm then by all means, keep playing. But if you want the series to move in a positive direction, you have to stop enabling this kind of treatment towards the series.
---
I've wanted Responders stuff for so looooong. :&gt;
---
As a level 1 player, If you have only one point in each special tree &amp; want to equip a card that cost 2 special points, it doesn‚Äôt matter what you un equip, since you will be unable to equip it due to a lack of special points. 
---
I am aware that you can only equip 7 cards, but if a level 50 is able to equip a rank 5 card in each stat, while a new player can only equip rank 1 cards in each stat, it isn‚Äôt really equal is it? 
---
It‚Äôs a small advantage, albeit not be a lot, but it‚Äôs there.
---
Yeah definitely, I rarely use the other generators at all unless I'm really low on materials
---
doesnt seem like it unless your gonna buy another copy...
---
Ok I‚Äôll stop enjoying the game if it‚Äôs upsetting you so much you have to formulate an argument
---
If you buy another disc then you can log in?
---
Fucks sake.
---
Overseer 5 gets you a skin for your stash
---
Havn't played the main quest?
---
How about Fallout 4?
---
It used to be even worse when people would launch nukes. The glowing ones used to award between 700-800 xp per kill if I remember correctly. You could level up 5 times in a matter of 30 minutes.
---
Oh. Also, do you need to win a game to earn that Power Armour skin or is it from tiers?
---
lmaooo
---
...You made comments about a game's current performance without having played the game recently?
---
Are you for serious?
---
Yeah I wish I was able to farm those guys back then
---
Yeah...lol.  This is my first...no, actually second thread.  I meant the title to be sort of ‚Äúcatchy,‚Äù but ‚Äúcatchy‚Äù on the Internet is sort of just like ‚Äúclickbait.‚Äù  And I also realized I did not write it well.  I reached out to ask you why you thought that because you wrote mixed things about the game in response.  And I see now that it appears as if I am saying all the criticism was undeserved. I guess I felt like there were always negative posts, and personally I have really had something I worked hard on go down in flames...and when that happens and people criticize your project or decisions, you can take it.  That is criticism to me.  It is anything beyond that, which is what I am referring to.
---
Maybe they can be domesticated. Or used as bait for quests.
---
I just wish I could lower it.. That and the atomic shop.
---
No clue haven't won yet or gotten far enough in the ranks
---
It‚Äôs in the upcoming update
---
My dream would be Enclave vs Brotherhood of steel with all the legendaries and power armor (of course if they ever managed to balanced them)
---
Oh yeah I farmed that place at the double exp weekend and levelled up around 15 times in about 2 hours
---
Head Canon atm:. Your player stumbles on vault 51 and enters.  Inside you enter a Sim pod placing you into NW.  This explains the lack of skills/perks/gear, the changes to the wasteland, and a reasonable motivation to kill othr vault dwellers... Because you know it's a Sim.
---
More to come as overseer rank reveals more of the story.  Looks like overseer Gil exited the vault and left the door open to me.
---
You also get adventure mode exp and caps for playing. Not a ton though.
---
Oh hell yeah I did
---
I saw a meme that made fun of the fact that even when we play the game again we usually make the same decisions because aside from wanting to see a different possible ending ... it's still "our" moral code that guides us.
---
I assume they mean along with a whole new account.
---
They are icons. Atleast the ones that I got this far are.
---
i figured this would happen, just wasn't gonna buy the game till i was sure lol
---
What, you can't nuke Flatwoods?
---
Anyone else getting stuck in the "looking for match" screen for 20+ minutes?
---
I think you can find the camera anywhere BUT the camera that starts the quest is that specific one. I say that because a buddy of mine was able to craft the camera off of a random broken pro snap I found just lying about.
---
You're fucking deluded.
---
Jeez then something very wrong is going on lol
---
WV wasn't hit directly by nukes. Pre-76 opening anyways. 
---
Most of the damage to it was caused by questionable practices by corporations before the war, ensuing chaos post war and during the scorch infestation.
---
If you don‚Äôt Danse, then you‚Äôre no friend of mine.
---
I am wondering about the same thing. Theres nothing in the Atomic Shop nor anywhere in Adventure Mode.
---
Yes, the "box copy" doesn't contain a cd, it just has a download key printed on a cd shaped piece of paper.    It says that in the Amazon description, or if you zoom in on the image of the game case it says it in small print at the bottom.  It seems kinda dumb that you gotta wait for the code to be shipped in the case,  but they charge full price for the digital copy.
---
It was good times man. Goooooood times.
---
I actually found another Mothman neon sign and that seems to have done the trick... They are so expensive now üò≠
---
Good luck!
---
Well it did continue to download and finished up eventually it just didnt show the correct size and time or progress. 
---
I played now for approx 1 hourish and well it wasnt too worth it. It feels like fallout but so weirdish off and restricted. And our experience so far was "yea game is mediocre" does it get better with time? I mean ive played a lot of fallout 4 recently and it just feels so off to play this now. And the audiologs are annoying, they autoplay for the story and keep on and on and on i had to mute the voices in the option to be able to communicate with my friends properly. But i dont want to only hate on the game, i like the looks and the map is actually quite beauitfull where we walked around. The lavish nature really feels great to walk around. Maybe we get into the game before the trial ends but right now i dont think so. We didnt had expectations after all this shitstorm yet it still feels so mediocre and average
---
Ah okay. I never looked at it that way, but I can totally see it
---
I wish it did. Can\`t wait to see how they retcon this one in. Probably won\`t be done well.
---
One is a player icon
---
The vault one is a photo frame
---
The later ones are stash box skins
---
The little red boxes with a nuke in them are perk cards
---
They're all automatically given to you, there aren't any loot boxes unless you count the random perk card you get
---
How do you play with a team
---
Ok, I Have seen posts on the Subreddit about people getting at and not being happy, my friend played it yesterday to see if it was any better, he said no, Ill try it for myself and Im very sorry i didnt give own facts on it, Like I will post Tomorrow and tell you what i think, I have also said I have loved this game and Really want it to get better, i have based alot of what I said on Recent posts and what I have heard
---
Two of my four characters that took a drink at the frat house woke up there. Fun time for the lower level one who had barely left the forest area.
---
You are aware that Fortnite is specifically built for BR while NW is just a BR add on to an MMORG right? Take a step back and look at the whole picture like an adult before you make yourself look like a child.
---
yeah i was worried about this with the way they described kill shot registering and kicking you out of VATS... I love gun fu and hope it is back sson :-(  
---
I DO like how quickly the kills register though - once they get gun fu working with this it will be sweet...
---
Thanks for voting for trump
---
None of this excuses the terrible release, or how bad the game was(it‚Äôs actually not bad now). What it DOES do is allow me to consider their next game worth a shot, and no, I‚Äôm obviously not pre-ordering.
---
This sort of ‚Äúrelease the game now and finish it later, obfuscating the problem by calling it a road map‚Äù is a crappy trend that I am becoming increasingly wary of.
---
No problems at all.
---
Cool bro added you up!
---
On the PlayStation
---
Wait. You get adventure mode rewards for NW?
---
Never played a battle royale before and I have to say it was shit.
---
Half of the time it was come out of vault spend 20 secs looking around to get bearings before guy in power armour charges up and shoots you with some huge gun... I am still in a vault suit with my bare hands... how can someone get all that stuff in 20 seconds. wtf?!!
---
The other half the time you do find some wood armour and something to shoot with,  you then manage to find some one... you kill them and are immediately shot in the back by some one else.
---
Not fallout and not fun... best thing about it has been that I now know to avoid anything 'battle royale'.
---
Noted, I appreciate that advice. I usually jump into random parties in these type of games to get to know ppl But I'll definitely be taking your advice.
---
Amazing advice and thank you :) I was actually wondering just that, where to build my C.A.M.P
---
Also what are those loot boxes we get each level? Are they cosmetics we can get in adventure mode? I understand the cards. But also can confirm I did not get levels in adventure mode
---
time for a fucking crusade
---
I saw something showing that they were starting to send them out this week or last.
---
thank you!  I assume the intention was for it to switch targets immediately after kill when gun fu is equipped - this will be sweet :-)   it is already one of my favorite perks and this would make it that much better :-)
---
Yes, i can understand that point of view. Play a role, pretend to be a bad guy ..... but there's an immersive quality (if you will) that makes that unlikely in my humble opinion. It's the duration. The specific intentional going against your true nature for so long ... see ...Maybe if the game was only one or two hours long .... but pretend to be a sick, violent psychopath for 780 hours? Naw ... I just don't think so. You make a good point, but i don't buy it.
---
You honestly believe he got undeservedly eviscerated? For lying doubling down and fixing the game to where it should have been at launch? Yikes.
---
Not got the link but it'll be all over here
---
Bloodieds die they just also kill superfast. Sometimes it's a trade off, sometimes it depends on what you're hit with.
---
I was just watching oxhorn play it and a random stopped shooting at him to wave and they buddied up despite being enemies and oxhorn was killed shortly after. He rejoined the lobby and ZAX said that making friends was a bad idea, or something like that.
---
People have been saying those are actually profile pictures.
---
I assume we aren't getting those sorta rewards until it's released proper, I've earned a load of crates but I have no idea what they are
---
I love BGS and I love most of their games. I think that TES 1-5, Fallout 3 and Fallout4 are all amazing games and I am thankful for them. But they totally fucked up the launch of Fo76. I had some fun with the game but so many things are just so poorly designed and boring. So yes the game is getting better (I thing the Nuclear Winter is a very good mode) but they deserved the criticism.
---
So can I not complete the hunter tadpole badge? Spent a chunk of time killing a Yao Guai with Rose's Syringer and didn't get the check mark. Last one I needed. Cmon, Bethesda.
---
&gt;I stuck it out on and off 
---
Those aren't phrases that go together. Like at all!
---
Apparently they're icons for your player
---
What's UpDog?
---
I don't farm whitesprings, I stick to west tek, generals steakhouse, robco, and sometimes harpers ferry
---
"Nucular" :D
---
try the scan and repair option in the launcher.
---
 There was and still is a lot wrong with the game itself. The mission design in the main quest for example is terrible.
---
Hunter is fine.  Chemist is not.  Hunter you have to kill one with a syringer but Hunter you just have to shoot them, it doesn‚Äôt register when you do.
---
LMAO good call
---
They are. I have one of those as my profile picture right now.
---
i do realize this.  but you do realize that by throwing their hats into the BR landscape they are held accountable to the standards of their competition.  
---
now if you would quit drinking the koolaid like a child and drink a beer like a man and analyze why they would throw their names into a crowded market you would see the only real answer is to fleece you fanboys out of more money.  
---
you can't polish a turd of a game by adding more shit to it.
---
Gotta craft it I believe.
---
Battle Royal = kiddie mode, no thanks.
---
Gotta craft it at the armor workbench
---
Thank you so much!
---
Once I'm back on Friday I'll try and remember to circle back to this, thanks for the details
---
Orrrr it‚Äôs just a fun side game. If you don‚Äôt like it, don‚Äôt play it and leave the community. You‚Äôre part of the 3% that come here to shit on the game. Your words are not taken seriously, so you would be better off investing your energy elsewhere.
---
Does that mean we can‚Äôt favorite in the atom shop to wear in nuclear winter?
---
Yeah, to answer your questions just interesting locations with resources and enemies to farm that's why I want to survey the map, my level is 113 but level doesn't matter really
---
Welcome to the wasteland. What platform are you on?
---
They can be anything from pictures to cosmetics, like the power armor on display in vault 51. Sti dont know how to access them though
---
Does anyone know how to get the E3 bundle on PS4 in EU? Atoms are only available to buy in the PlayStation store not the atom store and the bundle isn't there :(
---
I'm glad Bethesda is continuing development and making improvements. Also for what it's worth I enjoyed playing through '76 on release.
---
But I don't think it's right to be giving Bethesda accolades for releasing '76 in the state that it was and fixing it after the fact.
---
I have no clue what so ever..   
---
This is a text post, does not include a picture, weird
---
Well it‚Äôs a fair argument. If the series goes to shit, you won‚Äôt have anyone to blame but yourself. 
---
Cheers!
---
Bloodied builds are kind of ridiculous.
---
Lmao I know! Where are these damn crates!?
---
It‚Äôs sad how easily triggered you people get because someone believes BR is a bad addition to a flawed and rather unfinished product.  I guess it‚Äôs nice to be in the software industry where ‚Äúfailure‚Äù can never be measured because you can always have two more years to fix everything.. and collect more money in the process.  Participation trophies for all!
---
Obviously my fault that a game dev is incompetent
---
Good was worried about using my alt for it and not getting the stuff on main
---
I remember in the beta they gave you some stuff when you interacted with them. Just small amounts of materials or ammo, but still something! Then on full release they just stopped doing that.  Havent gotten loot from a single one since launch
---
That's how battles royale games work. Your'e supposed to die quick, so that it's a quick deathmatch, survival of the fittest.
---
It doesn‚Äôt help when mods for the r/Fallout sub and streamers participate in attacking the game. I‚Äôm sure the combination has driven away a lot of players who would have tried it otherwise.
---
It‚Äôs a shame people are willing to be so toxic.
---
Chad!
---
Yeah, I‚Äôve never battle royalled before and I‚Äôm pretty terrible but I‚Äôve enjoyed it so far.
---
What's wrong with battle royal? I see why people dont like Fortnite, but the format isn't bad.
---
For me it is a faint grey, but I have weird version of colorblindness
---
yep, I don't really think  every last thing in fo76 has to be "cannon" in order to be good.  It's just a game mode you can play or ignore, and whether or not it fits with anyones preconceived lore expectations is irrelevant.  
---
If anything coming in with an expectation that everything will be "official cannon" is setting yourself up for failure.  I don't think it's official lore that thousands of nukes went off in Appalachia 25 years after the Great War but that shouldn't stop anyone from playing adventure mode.
---
Your not wrong about that. Now we can see how much damage we ate doing. It's hard yo feel like your pulling your weight when your teammates can 18k of damage each.
---
If you go to the main menu and into the atom store there is a button option that allows you to wear it in NW
---
Sadly I think you might have a really good point. They play games too don't they? That makes me sad just to consider.
---
You know the one truth I have learned about "bad guys"? They usually don't know they are the bad guys. Oh some of them do. Some of them take great delight in being an a&amp;&amp;hole. But the bulk of them feel very justified in what they do. The people they hurt aren't victims, they're losers or pathetic or he's getting "them" before they get him.
---
Remember that Hitler didn't think he was a bad guy or "the" bad guy.
---
Yeah didn't notice at first but it's in the Mire, near dyer chemical I think but is it just a regular enemy or something more powerful I wonder? To rival sheepsquatch or even the queen
---
What do you play it on? How has the feel of the game felt so far?
---
Oof, less than a month old account, only posting on this subreddit to troll...
---
I‚Äôm sorry that this is the only way you can feel good about yourself.
---
I am not sure as I‚Äôm on Xbox I am sorry
---
The point of being informed BEFORE you make a purchase is so you don‚Äôt make a mistake.  You made the mistake and then doubled down by making yourself believe it was a finished product.  Pretty sure that‚Äôs tantamount to either fanboyism or low expectations.. either way - you are no one I‚Äôd be interested in sharing any further conversations with.  I prefer people who hold themselves and others to a higher standard than ‚Äúfailed to meet their own product deadlines but have promised to fix things.‚Äù  You call me a sheep, b all I see you doing is baaaaaaaaaad for the rest of the gaming community by enabling bad industry behavior.
---
How do you unlock?
---
Im seeing someone else say that the crates you get arent actually crates but are player icons of the crates. 
---
OP in the link made a comment saying so

Buy or own outfits in the Atom shop and then favourite them and you can wear them in game
---
ITS good But i LOVE to hear some jokes or Funny coments good work
---
By getting ranks(levels) in nuclear winter.
---
A+
---
Well this is definitely the most unique comment so far, and I must say I am shocked it took so long before someone said something political lol
---
Ah, thanks for the info.
---
Once acquired how do you open them? In a menu? Can‚Äôt seem to find where myself
---
I haven‚Äôt played yet, but reportedly you can select any Atom Store cosmetics in the store itself and mark them as NW favorites. They‚Äôll then appear when appropriate. Also worth noting is that, in NW, I think costumes only appear when you have no armor. Once you pick up armor, costumes disappear.
---
I literally have no idea what you are talking about here.  I didn‚Äôt remove any of my messages in this post.  I‚Äôm sorry someone on the internet has bashed the game you enjoy and that triggers you.
---
You can access any skins and icons you get in nuclear winter in atom shop.
---
They are icons, not lootboxes
---
Again I'm sorry that's the take away.  
---
I started as one of those Posters sitting unacknowledged by Bethesda, my goal was not to crash the system but to force a dialog, which succeeded.    
---
At the time all of this started there were hundreds of angry voices on Reddit, BethNet, etc, I don't apologize for deliberately forcing myself out of the pack and into the light, I think it was worth it.  
---
The action and result can be seen as selfish, hell I'll openly admit I wanted my voice heard, but it's not to bend the will of '76 to my vision (well maybe a little, who wouldn't) but to get issues publicly acknowledged, more transparency and  better communication, which appears to have worked, atleast at the moment.
---
What about it feels clunky to you? Runs totally fine for me
---
pvp without the cheap builds is nice.
---
No prob! :)
---
What about the crates ?
---
Ugh.... Settlers or Raiders?!?
---
Which one to choose????
---
I've passed on all the plush animal stuff, but I'm getting that wavy Willard's gator as soon as it hits the atom shop.
---
on PC... yes. For the second account you just need to launch through the fallout76.exe not the bethesda launcher.
---
The crates are icons, you‚Äôll find them in the Atom shop too..
---
Is this a joke or r u dead ass
---
Honestly anywhere near water. There‚Äôs lots of rivers and unmarked lakes, some beautiful cliffsides too in the middle of the map. Water gives you purified water easier when you find plans for water purifiers. Or you can find deposits on google pretty easily, look for lead/steel or whatever resource you need and if you park your camp on it you can extract them for free resources.
---
Your vision is glorious, great one. We shall follow you to the depths of hell.
---
Four Dog. Three Dogs cousins daughters brother.
---
Seems like they can easily have at least 6 maps for the 6 pre existing regions at the least.  Forest, mire, bog, divide, ash heap and toxic valley.    
---
But really they could probably have at least 12 or 18 maps by making each one a specific slice of the pre existing zones above. Never mind making project paradise into a map, the burrows, the new vaults yet to be released, etc.
---
Oh sad but ty fir the info
---
That right there is what forced me to do what I did, the silent, unresponsive void, I get it.  
---
In the end I can only hope this is the start of better communication with us, if nothing else.
---
Such comments are hardly surprising given how nuclear winter is as far from a fallout game as you could possibly get... dozens of people running around frantically shooting is hardly the carefully considered rich backstory  environment of an RPG. 
---
I'll leave it to the squeakers and stick to the real fallout (which 76 only *just* manages to achieve so far)
---
Bethesda doesn‚Äôt have a history of reusing voice-actors in different role in the same game, don‚Äôt get hysterical.
---
Fair enough. As I mentioned earlier, I‚Äôm not entirely familiar with all the systems in the game and, this particular event I described in my post was my first experience capturing a workshop. Since it was a first for me, it left a bad taste overall as you can imagine. I will try to improve my gear in any case, thanks a lot for your input!
---
Damn yeah I see that in the atom shop. Thanks for letting me know.
---
Thanks for the feedback! I wanted to focus on building him up before expanding on how creative I could get with it. Like documenting his development. Will definitely consider it for later episode thoughüëåüèæ
---
Please clarify for Bethesda that what you want is additional radio stations.
---
Oh man you can see everyone‚Äôs damage? That‚Äôs going to be deflating as hell as a fellow rifle build. I‚Äôm not saying they will or should but assuming they need bloodied I guess anti armor is the next best? My mutants explosive pipe revolver rifle is my best gun and it‚Äôs only at ~300 damage. 
---
That being said, yes I would like rifles to get buffed a little. I have no interest in playing bloodied and dying all the time.
---
Stash box
---
Keep deleting stuff, you're good at that. If you can't form your own opinion that's sad. 
---
You're just listening to YouTubers that benefit from the outrage . They make careers out of that (same as with people that do reaction videos) 
---
Look at what happened to Star wars battlefront 2 , it was indeed a bad game in launch (like this title) but like all companies say.
---
No online infrastructure is perfect on launch. Heck !! Even Warcraft 3 had online issues and that's perfectly fine because nothing is perfect on release. 
---
Now you're saying that the battle Royale was the "last straw" for you but you don't even own the game. You haven't even played it, someone on the internet that benefits from rage have you his opinion and you took it just like that. 
---
Calling me a delusional individual for forming my own opinions is kind of pathetic from someone that just prefers the voices of influencers than his own opinion.
---
And you know, being mind numbingly boring
---
I have to agree I hate battle royal games but it is fun. The only detraction for me is not being able to join with friends and be on the same team. Hope that makes it in the end. Does it come down to one player or a team?
---
Yeah man, I don't think going overboard on someone is good. But Bethesda messed up basically everything possible with the launch of FO 76 and so people being harsher than normal is justified in my opinion. The bigger the mistake, the more the criticism is actually NEEDED. 
---
As someone who has many, many, many times poorly worded his arguments I get it though.
---
Welcome brother! Just wait, it gets better.
---
Ok, I'll bite. For once. Then I'll stop listening to your ignorance.
---
&gt; Developers that care don't knowingly release broken games to the public
---
Have you seen the state of gaming? Basically no game is "not broken" at release. I don't remember any. Also, gaming companies don't shift deadlines, once they are announced. Sad truth, but truth... if this is mark of developers not caring, then no developer is caring...
---
&gt; lie about collector's edition contents
---
Yeah, I'm sure the game developers are responsible for shipping goodies. What's next? Are they responsible for food in cantina too? Or for watering the flowers?
---
&gt; introduce bugs in patches
---
Do you know about software development? Patches bring out new bugs, that's reality of SW development. And if you are talking about the one patch that re-introduced bugs, that was an honest mistake, not a symptom of not caring. I'm fairly sure noone at Bethesda went "MUHAHA, let's put some bugs back in, to prove ho EEEEVIL we are...
---
QED, Bethesda cares...
---
BR fan (thousands of hours played) and not a massive fan of 76 (played probably 6 hours since release and bought on release day), this mode is super fun, it adds a pretty neat twist with having npcs and the environments feel really fun to fight in. I can't see it being competitive like Pubg or Fortnite but for some fun matches it definitely holds up. Its a different feeling than most BR's and its pretty interesting. The first time a scorchbeast came sweeping down in the final circles was seriously awesome to see.
---
Its not. I want a radio host for Appalachia radio
---
Because I‚Äôm interested in the game, not the disturbing fetishism over ‚ÄúLord Howard‚Äù
---
Looks like I picked the wrong day to quit playing fo76.
---
Oh ... OK.
---
But can we also get more radio stations?
---
There really is a lot of potential for this game mode I believe. I hope they add a few more weapons too like the Gatling Plasma/Laser or a Fatman launcher (maybe with only one shot). Stuff like that could be cool
---
I checked and nothing.
---
I'm thinking the crate gave perk packs for nuclear winter
---
We're just a *simulation*, man. ^inhales Jet
---
Chad!!
---
This too. Lol
---
Have you found one yet?
---
I am in Australia so if you still haven't found one, that may be the issue.
---
Totally siding with Raiders if Rose is in the picture.
---
I got the bundle. Go to buy something that‚Äôs more atoms than you have. Click purchase more atoms. And boom there it is.
---
Three Dog‚Äôs great, great grandpa Dog
---
It‚Äôs already fully repaired.
---
And I got a server disconnect while reading this love letter...yup thanks for sticking by us.. ü§£ ü§£
---
I've always considered any weapon or skin in 76 non-canon unless specifically made here and it's appearance purely for player enjoyment.
---
Think of the story that was being told, though. Year 1, there‚Äôs no other living humans besides us. They‚Äôve all fled from the Scorch or died from it with the only other options being turned into a super mutant, ghoulifying and going feral, or morphing into a wendigo. We, the dwellers from 76, spend a year eradicating the Scorch. We settle down afterwards and start to rebuild Appalachia... Then, everyone comes back. 
---
Sure, having no NPCs at launch was weird for a Fallout game, but it works so well in the story.
---
Legit, thanks.
---
this.  there's no reason to not just try it out.  If you don't like it that's fine, plenty of other games out there.
---
Thanks for slogging through it.  
---
I'm going to agree, having a more "polished" launched product and a public timeline, even if vague, would have been better, but the free DLC and updates tempers my frustration a bit, as we are not in the boat some are, getting half a game and paying for what should have been there in the first place.  
---
No, we are just having to do beta testing ;). 
---
But seriously, I've got more than 12gbs of unpublished content for FO4, about 6 or 7 mods worth, sometimes you have to draw the line, stop the feature creep and publish.  
---
Not excusing or justifying, empathizing
---
It's that. I hope some of this stuff is unlockable and not just purchasable.
---
The crate at levels 5, 6, and 7 are all different stash boxes you can place in your CAMPs in Adventure.
---
You last sentence there took the words right out of my mouth. It‚Äôs what a Fallout BR would be like... 
---
my first thoughts exactly when I saw two streams on Youtube earlier.
---
Dunno what I was expecting, but, I got excited to play it
---
Because the game downloads the update.  It has to have space to complete the download before it updates your game (in some cases, the download is the whole game, and it simply replaces the old file.  In other cases it only downloads the parts necessary to do the smaller file replacements or patches).
---
We get the same question every patch, and the answer is the same every patch.  It's not going to change any time in the foreseeable future.
---
Ah brilliant! I think it just wasn't refreshing earlier it's working now!
---
You dont have to manually unlock the chests? I havent seen anything pop up saying i unlocked anything
---
Its pre beta. They will tweek it according to feedback
---
What if I already have 5 characters? Can I still create a new one for Nuclear Winter?
---
Yessir, it‚Äôs a dope coat! Enjoy. Lol. Plus the extra atoms were nice
---
Thard be cool
---
I have not :/ I sat in the "waiting for game" screen for about 20 minutes before giving up.
---
That's literally my whole feeling of it at the moment. It's Fallout BR. Simply put. It's what's keeping me playing, honestly. Totally loving it!
---
There are no chests to unlock, these are either icons for your account or skins for your stashbox for adventure/survival mode.
---
Its the same as setting an icon in adventure and surv. Open atom shop and youll see ones to buy and ones owned. Highlight and select an owned one. A small check mark should show in the top corner. Its now your selected icon. There may be some that only work in NW mode. I cannot confirm that yet.
---
Excalty I got a Tse and it sits under 300  with out the demo perk. Yet my buddy is dropping this in one attack. I'm like dude.. ü§£ ü§£ Leave some for me.
---
That‚Äôs too much to ask man. Set your standards lower then they‚Äôll deliver that lol
---
Bro lol imo this doesn't show anything.
---
They still launched a game that was horrendously unfinished. This toxified the entire community except those who couldn't be offended by anything...
---
Almost a year later and they've fixed some things shows they care so much? No by my standards....
---
I recently went into this game and was looking to see some of the changes. At least I could now change the name of my PA and weapons which should've been day 1 features. They were in FO4.
---
Nope my PA name change screws up whenever I leave the changed suit.
---
Then the PA bug is still there where if I drop a PA the 'collect' option isn't there until I enter then exit the suit? So there's 2 bugs now. So finding this out negates that I even changed the name in the first place cause the name reverts back after you exit the suit lol. They didn't even test this before sending it out....
---
I really tried to give this game it's chance but I almost don't even care if they fix everything. You look at everything else they pulled with locking up and reselling the clothes etc and I'm bitter still. 
---
FO4 was incredibly better then this game could ever be.
---
I didn't find PA too hard to take down. A couple of hits to the back of the head with a combat rifle and they're downed, then just spray them with a machine gun or something.
---
They show up as chest when you level up, and when i get to them at least they just disapear
---
I noticed recently that between the bog town and pylon v-13 there are resources to farm. Acid and oil.  Also there are random legendary mobs to farm if you have strong base defenses. the third floor of the tall building is full to farm for screws, the rail car has several batteries to farm for lead and every type of free workbench. 
---
Now that I detailed it I might move out of the acid cave and go there. Lvl 65 and I‚Äôve never invested in base defense perks, I need to figure that out.
---
I had a good time at launch too... 3 crashes in first week and 3 more over the next 6 months. Some disconnects and a few T-posing ghouls. Solid launch for any online game. Even for Bethesda that was a great launch in my experience. And the launch was like 100x more better than Fallout New Vegas. Sadly, this experience wasn't so smooth for everyone. That's the reality of SW development. Some systems, some configurations, some networks... someone always has a hard time. And for Fo76 it was true as well. Of course there were tons of people just stirring the pot claiming how "their friend" had constant crashes, tradesteal bugs, etc... But even when you filtered out the fake reports, many of enthusiastic players had a hard time with the stability and bugs...
---
Yes such as caps and ex
---
You need to edit the .ini file.  Google it
---
&gt;absolutely game-breaking
---
This is my feedback
---
Any idea if the cosmetic items you unlock are account wide or just for that character?
---
You deleted the message from the thread, people can no longer read that you haven't played it .
---
I haven‚Äôt listened to one single piece of fucking commentary from a single YouTuber.  The one I mentioned before made a Twitter post that someone else had pointed me towards.  Every review I have read since release said it was a total shit show.  To deny this and say all those people are crazy and part of a conspiracy to make money on criticism is plain bullshit.  If you think THAT is a logical argument, then arguing with you is a fools errand.  The game supposedly will have a free trial this week to which I‚Äôm going to try it for myself to get one final opinion before making my purchase decision.  It‚Äôs clear from other commenters and other threads here - there are a lot more people unhappy about the BR mode than you‚Äôd imply.  I‚Äôm sorry your delusions of a ‚Äúgreat game‚Äù have been soured by majority opinion, but that‚Äôs the way shit goes sometimes.  Hopefully Bethesda heard those voices and made changes because God knows no developer would ever fix their shit if WE didn‚Äôt hold them accountable.  
---
And considering your rush to judge others for making such criticisms, I‚Äôd say you fall right into the category of the PROBLEM and not the solution.  Because you can‚Äôt fix a problem if you pretend there isn‚Äôt one
---
Yes, these are icons. Icons that represent chests. They aren't lootboxes that you can open. Check "Icons" in atomshop and scroll all the way down, you'll see them there to select.
---
Well thats annoying.
---
It's very simple, after about 5 tries opening an empty porta potty, your enemy will lower their guard thinking you've moved on.  At that moment when he open's the sixth porta potty, you have readied your Grognak's axe and plunged it into his skull.
---
There is a flag on your compass that points you in closest direction of circle as well
---
But it's broken. I can't use it.
---
People always complain about something. I am glad too that Bethesda didn't give up. The Menu video alone is a great improvement.
---
Exp
---
Slightly above average PC here, the game just keeps you in a loading screen until everybody is in. No advantages
---
Why don‚Äôt you just make your character bloodied
---
I've done nothing. Installed the free version to try and was shocked it ran that bad. Playing BF5 maxed no issues at 100fps
---
Man I have no idea what this means. I can‚Äôt wait to get home and log on to see what the hell you are talking about.
---
There is on XBox.
---
You deleted the big statement you wrote , that big wall of text you wrote without even playing the game lmao
---
No idea.
---
It's most likely because the game is familiar and you're not learning everything from scratch - you know what you're looking for and what you enjoy using, you know the map, you know how to play the game already. I was sceptical but it's pretty alright.
---
Because I don't like running around with low health.
---
Creation Club skins? Hmm...hope they're only a dollar then
---
The Vault Boy and Vault Girl PA helmets are the most unsettling things Bethesda has ever produced.
---
That must be the issue then. I waited for so long, my controller turned itself off.
---
Good luck finding a match. I have been trying since 6am (I'm in Sydney)
---
I know how they work, but it's the quickest out of all the BR games I've played. Or at least it seems that way.
---
The only one I've played where you can't move after being downed as well. Which makes death even faster. Which is why I would like to see a revive system, even if the item I mentioned is rare.
---
When was human npcs announced?
---
So want to do nuclear winter
---
Yep people dont even need to play the real game to get rich
---
Hell yeah and pets would be a nice thing too they we're in npc fallouts
---
It‚Äôs a player icon in the atomic shop.
---
That‚Äôs really strange. Screenshots?
---
Maybe [this](https://store.playstation.com/nl-nl/product/EP1003-CUSA12054_00-F76SP10000000000) will help? It's for the Netherlands PS4 site but can possibly be changed or redirect you based on location?
---
Bethesda has done a lot of things right lately but man...a "fix" that breaks an intended effect of a perk? Like no one on the dev team popped up and said, "Say, if we close VATS immediately, what will happen to Gun Fu?"
---
I think survival mode is dead now, change my mind
---
Lmao every thing I said is an objective fact. The ame was broken when it came out.
---
*oh shit this guy has valid criticism, better check his account to see if I can negate any uncomfortable feelings I'm having. OH! I see his account is a month old, that means the game wasn't broken when it came out!*
---
Brilliant.
---
I'm rank 9. I should be able to let you know in a little bit.
---
The quest are good to play alone. The loot is fun playing as a team.
---
Thank you!  Nice to know i didn't miss something.
---
What do you get if you plant shit seeds Randy? You get shit weeds.
---
RIP The Liquor!
---
It wasn‚Äôt deleted by me asshat.  The moderators in the forum have deleted several people‚Äôs posts including mine with no reason given.  I guess you can call that censoring
---
Thank you to Todd Howard for keeping me banned allllllll this time...
---
Nuclear Winter is fun. I got the Chameleon mutation almost right away and it felt super cheesy shooting people then just vanishing. Didn't help much though when I was alone against the last team of three.
---
It‚Äôs funny I love this game more than fallout 4 and new Vegas and fallout 3 overall but lately on ps4 my game freezes every 10 seconds I can‚Äôt even pick anymore I‚Äôll freeze in air and get vats by some faggot
---
Why the heck can't you favorite under armor to wear in nuclear winter!
---
I don't get that either. I have no interest in a BR mode, but I don't see any point in acting like an ass over it or towards anyone who does like it. I'm perfectly content to keep on going with adventure mode and looking forward to Wastelanders.
---
It's not a centaur but thanks for the reply.
---
I‚Äôm still hoping they are going to add the handmade skin!!!
---
Hi still hoping they are going to add the handmade skin!!!, I'm dad.
---
I found nothing in my stash box from this mode.
---
It‚Äôs fun. It‚Äôs tense and rather random (the last time I didn‚Äôt find a lick of armor!) but yeah I can see me wasting time on it.
---
No, I mean like it unlocks a stash box in the camp section
---
Didn't you read what I just wrote? No online infrastructure is perfect on release , you're going to have your bumps on the way but at the end of the day it will get fixed.  Even Warcraft 3 (one of the best online game modes I've ever played) suffered at the beginning of its face. But that's with every single online infrastructure.
---
One of my few kills today was with the Gatling.  I felt like a badass; then I got killed.  My biggest ‚Äúcomplaint‚Äù is everything stopping in order to glance at the map or inventory.  I‚Äôve been trained by the BR genre to be able to use these on the fly.  If we could just drag and swap weapons as they stack-up on the wheel, it would help a a lot.
---
yeah i know i was referring to not having one at the time lol
---
Yeah I wouldn't say it's cheating I run a full stealth/vats critical build and can one shot most things. Though I usually go down in a couple shots if I'm detected
---
Almost is key. All other games from all other platforms work flawlessly aside from POE but that update has been buggy.
---
I have my vending machines hooked up to a switch, I just power cyclemy camp and it normally fixes it when it happens to me
---
Yeah I always hated battle royal but this is actually fun. I gotta admit I'm a horrible sniper but today I managed to powerfist a guy. I'm all happy.
---
I had to reload the game for it to show! Got it now- thank you!
---
Same!
---
dude it's a great game I've been able to have fun and find things to do since the beta not many games can do that
---
Search for the Tricentennial Edition and the option to install should be there. That is how I finally found it after waiting all day.
---
Spawned in. Was immediately attacked by a glowing rad scorpion, before I could even get my bearings. Ran in confused terror toward a barn next to me. Jumped onto something for height to protect myself, and a person in power armor walked in and killed me instantly. Total game time: 2 minutes, 20 seconds.
---
TWO MINUTES AND TWENTY SECONDS.
---
&gt; I've got a plan for the Single Action Revolver Ivory Grip sitting in my vendor for 20k caps. Waiting for the memelord who ends up picking that one up.
---
Yup! Mines sitting in there for 15k. Most items I‚Äôm selling are under 100c, with only higher-end legendaries marked over about 250.
---
Yeah, every second comment out there is saying how they lost faith in Bethesda and won't buy anything because "Imaginary scenario XYZ" (e.g. killing nexus mods). But Starfield is guaranteed to be at least a mediocre success and TES6 is bound to be a huge success. Once the casual crowd finds out there's "Skyrim in space" and "Skyrim 2" the sales will go through the roof. And then the nay-syaing crowd will bite the bullet and play the game. Because in the end games are about having fun. And when masses are having fun with a game, they cannot feel left out... It's easy to ignore unpopular game like Fo76, but quite difficult to ignore something popular. Very little gamers are patient gamers...
---
When I turned on the game today and saw the notice my first thoughts were "Is it Tuesday already?" and "Did I sleep through Monday?"
---
Love the game. 
---
I got it a couple weeks after launch and I‚Äôll admit it was a fat steaming pile of shit, but I‚Äôm glad they are doing their best to fix it and I‚Äôm very excited for the future.
---
Lol I‚Äôm sure they are luxuriating in great pay, benefits, and work-life balance
---
Good lord! 300%!?! How does that compare to marsupial??
---
Ok thx. Also, you know there‚Äôs holotape for rank 6 behind the red curtains on the left side in the music room, right?
---
Iam impressed that the lobby with 51 players in a small area is pretty stable on PS4 pro ! Also the mode is quite fun.
---
I was revived by a level 20ish awhile ago so I followed him and dropped a 3 star for him as a thank you. Immediately responded "I don't want this shit wtf" 
---
Can't win
---
Fallout 4 was the first and only game in the franchise I've played. I still play it today, and it has eclipsed Ocarina of Time as my favorite game of all time. I was absolutely pumped when 76 was announced, but have waited to buy it because of the backlash. Is it time to buy now, especially with the new updates?
---
I applaud the mods for silencing someone that complains about something that he doesn't have ;)
---
You haven't even tried the game therefore your conclusions are someone else's.
---
Level up and do it a point at a time or start over. Respec at any time would fundamentally break the game.
---
The only problem I have with Nuclear winter is I can't figure out how to queue with my friends so we can play together
---
Wow. That was not obvious at all. Thanks dude
---
&gt; Add a matchmaking filter for teams, and solo matches 
---
Yes please, and as if teams weren't already at a massive advantage, many perks and magazines reward you even further only if you're on a team for some reason. That's my biggest complaint so far; the odds are stacked so heavily against solo players currently. My only other major complaint is that radium rifles are way too common. Pretty much every player I've ran into is using one, and I am too. It makes stimpaks kinda useless... They should be a gold chest weapon in my opinion
---
Try to do a search for Fallout 76, that's how I first found it as I've been refreshing it every two hours or so until it finally showed a ninth result.  Should say "Demo | PS4" it is listed between Full Game and 500 Atoms on my results page.
---
It‚Äôs not just about being ‚Äúperfect‚Äù it‚Äôs about holding up to a higher standard to which this game fell incredibly short.  The same can be said on day one for just about every EA game that is released.
---
The difference is that the gaming community simply opens their wallet regardless of flaws and then on Reddit‚Äôs like this, people who criticize as a means to improve the game get harassed for being invested in caring.  I was one of the people excited about MP Fallout and then horrified when it released in the state it was.  My nonpurchase was my way of saying I don‚Äôt approve.  I‚Äôve come here in reconsideration, but also in frustration about the BR decision.  As a result, I‚Äôm harassed and others are as well for having this opinion.  That‚Äôs fucked up
---
Might be a bit easier when people get home from work etc fingers crossed!
---
I hate to suggest it because I think you‚Äôll have to restock them but maybe storing then placing them again will fix?
---
Exactly.
---
These same people would flip if they bought anything else that incomplete and buggy.
---
I agree with this. I think i was landing shots for 180! It does good if you find it early and people don‚Äôt have 50 cals tho!
---
Yep, me too!  Come grab some legendaries!
---
(Plays sad trombone) womp womp...
---
There hasn‚Äôt been one released
---
My experience with new players hasn't been that good on PC so far ;_; Almost all of them I've met have been insanely rude and toxic, one guy followed me around screeching into the mic while another one just shouted the "N" word the second he left the vault
---
Tried giving one guy some stimpacks and water and he told me to kill myself, this is why I'm worried about the game coming to Steam, because I feel like they're gonna have free weekends all the time and people like this will eventually take over.
---
Same, never played BR. 2 times lost then 2 times win. Mics are indeed a must have.
---
I never concluded anything other than my disappointment that BR was chosen.  YOU triggered commenters (who haven‚Äôt given up) completely misrepresented my post because all you could think of was how can this person disagree with me.
---
A total ‚Äúreeeeee‚Äù moment for the internet
---
You can craft it at the armor workbench I believe it's under outfits. It cost like five cloth to assemble it.
---
Fall.
---
Next fall
---
Why do people act like fortnite is a terrible game? It's solid and that's coming from someone who isn't keen at all on the visual style. If you like pubg you should give it a try.
---
He probably has a very sad life, so complaining about things make him feel better and justified. Without even trying out for himself , he's jumped to conclusions and he thinks the world revolves around him. Kind of sad tbh bits alright, I know people like him. It's sad &lt;3
---
Haha yeah, it was rough at first for me too. It gets a lot better once you unlock new perk cards! Also literal visual stealthiness helps :).
---
Damn man. That‚Äôs messed up! I had good experiences so far. My mike is off though ;-)
---
tell that to the 6 feral ghouls now running after my redheaded ass
---
There better be a trap in that suicide booth.
---
The boxes are player icons.
---
I think the time to kill and how long you stay down for is perfect. And Putting respawning into NW would be a horrible idea.
---
do you need to play nuclear winter to unlock the plans?
---
Unless that's one womp for no and two womps for yes you have to use your words.
---
How do you open or access these crates?
---
Yeah..I restarted my system probably about 20 times today thinking that would help. I've been searching around all day and helping others almost as long. Funny thing is, I'm still waiting on MY download to finish!
---
Finally us Responders can do our jobs!
---
im impressed
---
No, you listed several facts and drew a conclusion which is your *opinion.*
---
Facts:
---
Bethesda lied about the collector‚Äôs edition. (Not the developers, as you so poorly put it).
---
Bugs were reintroduced with a patch (and subsequently removed with another).
---
Your stupid bullshit:
---
Everything else.
---
I have been enjoying the game but the bugs are killing me... Right now I just can't walk, so I might quit playing if I don't find a fix for the bug...
---
Sorry for the late response, that is correct. But even if you decided to PVP I don‚Äôt think there would be enough lag to considerably impact the outcome of the battle.
---
Are there holotapes in the general area?
---
That sucks. I'm sick today so I was hoping to get some time to play before the other people in the house take over everything I own.
---
If you find a game, let me know.
---
NW is shaping up well, I just haven‚Äôt figured out how to get different outfits in NW, is that an unlock? Or is there a stash you can access?
---
The bugs are terrible and warrant the loser trombone... the womps are the sound effect created by a trombone.
---
yea i'm a little worried that there wasnt anything in this patch because now they are gonna be focused on this new DLC they are gonna forget about us
---
What if i use a mine ?
---
Well, he/she is announcing publicly that they love nuclear winter. The service is that you may too? Dunno just trying to throw them a bone.
---
damn, does it require a lot of matches? how it is stat wise?
---
There‚Äôs a shitstorm a-brewin‚Äô Randy, I cant smell the shit in the air!
---
Thanks finally someone answered.
---
Lmao so instead of intentionally breaking the game they...accidentally released the game...broken? I'm not sure what you're saying. That means they just ignored months of alpha/beta testers feedback then, that's fundamentally worse. 
---
Do you think they just had absolutely flawless internal testing during the entire development, and everything went to shit the exact day of release? The fucking beta literally deleted itself from people's computers. The game was so broken it just...quit itself. 
---
This game was broke, they knowingly shipped it in its broken state. End of. There is 100% no excuse for that.
---
Absolutely no clue lol. Only reason i know this is because of the terminals in game. Sorry.
---
Yeah, I'm trying not to let it get me down, but so far I've yet to find a nice new player, gonna keep trying, though!
---
Since the update on PC today I've crashed twice while opening the map and two of my friends experienced the exact same issue when opening the map.
---
Aside from today I haven't had any notable crashes in my 100 or so hour  play time. Server stability is a whole other issue entirely though and I agree with the OP above that stability is pretty bad.
---
You're not being harassed, you exposed yourself with self pity to a forum where people play the game. You haven't played it. You can't form your own opinions , you depend on reviewers. It's sad :)
---
fug, thanks anyway, I have yet to even enter the vault 51, and I'm sure as hell not gonna play the br mode if it takes overseer lvl 10 or some bs to unlock it.
---
I came so close to winning. I got out numbered by a team of 4 :(
---
 Interesting how Shotguns use up all the damn perks. I don't use em' anymore myself. Consider this:
---
 My 15 Strength is all my Knives. They are amazing and the core of the build.
---
 I think its 14 Perception and the Rifle Perks, that's being changed To Auto Perks, but of course can be changed back anytime. Grenadier is in there too.
---
 I have 5 Ironclad for 50 Ballistic and Energy Resistance and 3 Fireproof. I rotate Aquaboy, Ghoulish and Sun Kissed for the last point. This build sells Stimpacks and poping one for a limb is rare, but easy.
---
 I dunno 4 Charisma and Lone Wanderer is hard to beat for solo.
---
 Yup 5 Explosive and everything else, and there is a lot gets slotted in and out for crafting.
---
 I use a bit less Adrenaline. My knives go to 'one shot' quickly. 
---
 Luck gets 5, 2 for Starched Genes and 3 for bloody Mess.
---
 Now the point of all this is that I have one very very good weapon set, my knives. One quite amazing weapon set, my Rifles or really now my 2* Handmade Exploder with 30% more for Animals, pretty well all bosses. As well I have a buffed TS Auto Grenade Launcher that does a lot of damage to entire areas.
---
 I get all of that and buff them from my perks. You get to use Shotguns, see where this goes?
---
I got to play 3 games before work and I‚Äôm itching for more. This shift can not go fast enough.
---
Just repaired my handmade and shotgun to 200% WA worked as before. If I remember to and I don't care about losing the server I'll change cards, then logout and back in to force-load the perks, a pain but sometimes needed.
---
Yes this too is a proven method, however, remember to place the mine far enough away from your own porta potty.
---
It‚Äôs been working as intended for me today. I‚Äôve repaired a lever action, assaultron blade, and hunting rifle all to 200%. Maybe it‚Äôs weapon specific?
---
I finally joined a game!
---
Yes! I love it. I hate that after this week we have to wait for it to come back
---
It took 5hours to download and install
---
Are you using the perk loadout manager mod?
---
I think you just did the tadpole challenges... the possum challenges require 8 badges for the high capacity mod.
---
I‚Äôve been wondering the same thing as well
---
Do you actually get to be the Overseer?
---
No problem, figured it out earlier.
---
Fair enough. It‚Äôs much better with a group of friends. I‚Äôve come close to winning but always ended up out numbered there towards the end.
---
&gt;how can this person disagree with me 
---
&gt;Hasn't even played it 
---
&gt;Looks for online reviews 
---
&gt;It says that I should jump from a bridge 
---
&gt;Jeez I guess I have to kill myself since this is what everyone is doing
---
Yes, I know what sounds a trombone makes.  The problem here is that instead of helping confirm the bug you're just being a dick about it.
---
Fall come here sooner god dammit!!!!
---
Charisma has a great perk that decreases enemy damage when you shoot at them. Requires 9 charisma though :(
---
When you are in the main menu, go to social and invite your friends to your team. Then whoever is team leader selects play with team and that will queue a game with your friends.
---
How do you use use the crates you get with levelling up on Nuclear Winter?
---
They're player icons. The crates are. All rewards are in the atomic shop.
---
Basically every other BR feels better. I love Fallout but can‚Äôt twist my soul and say I like this mode. The map is not designed for BR, it doesn‚Äôt feel intuitive, the UI is bad and feels slow in general.
---
It's just random internet strangers why bother giving the slightest damn about upvotes or downvotes? Especially in a gaming sub where the avg user age is slightly below the rest of Reddit which is mostly college aged to begin with
---
after reading the comments here i got this great idea time to get the still fired up....
---
Nice! I spent $90 NZD on it and had absolutely no regrets!
---
Let me play you a sad song on the World's Smallest Violin
---
Nothing was directed at you. Commenting on the bug. Don‚Äôt be so sensitive.
---
Are Nuclear Winter perk cards account or character bound?
---
What if i cant find the outift in the shop?
---
Used to almost always get nuclear material from them. Be nice if they at least yeilded that or ultracite
---
Umm... they're not griefer. Adventure mode as is is so anti-griefer this is pretty much the only way you can be push into PvP.
---
How long did you have to wait?
---
Awesome! Thats insane! Do you know if its NW exlusive?
---
Make him a boss if you nuke a certain area. "A new enemy is terrorizing the wasteland" Legendary 3* glowing lvl 105 wooby is here to ruin your day!
---
That's the issue though.  If one build is clearly better than others then either it needs a nerf or others need a buff.  DPS should be similar with these builds or the game promotes one specific build which is boring.  It's not like there is much of a point to healer or tank type specializations in this game anyway...
---
i found a game within a couple of minutes, don‚Äôt join as group
---
Returning player, anyway to get past the 60FPS cap or make it feel less janky? I got a 144hz monitor and I remember on release I had to mess with an ini and it felt MUCH better.
---
Now it feels like forced vsync and mouse acceleration and its making me a bit dizzy.
---
Repaired my lever action, mini gun and axe with no issues. All over repaired.
---
Yeah I have been catching bits and pieces of it.
---
Getting on now to check some of it out
---
I would love to but voice chat has never worked for me I cant hear a thing..
---
Its going free to play supposedly. The base game and the first DLC will be free and all the other expansions will be paid. I was just about to buy it but I guess I'll wait to try it out
---
I'm of the opinion that many low level players from and around 76 are mules or 3rd 4th 5th characters with specific goals and having others run up waving and heart emoting so cringe it's worthy of one shotting, but as that is not possible in adventure they turn up toxic to 100% max :/
---
That's vault 51, we've known this since about March
---
It's really fun! I dropped a nuke and it killed my whole squad and the enemy's, got a stalemate.
---
I'm pretty sure it is. They mention that NW has a lot of exclusive cards.
---
What about challenges? Does placing a camp in NW count for planning your camp 76 times?
---
It was in the trailer one of the first ones to
---
I wish it could handle pvp. Sadly the frames die once people start shooting. - ps4
---
You can party up from the social menu while at the main screen then just press play and choose the gamemode and you will be in a party
---
Only the future will tell, Ad victoriam brother.
---
Autumn. If you‚Äôre not American ;)
---
Oom nom nom
---
What do they mean free trial week? After that would we have to pay to continue, I thought all DLC was gonna be free
---
They did make them separate. My cousin just bought it, and she's wearing her regular hat instead of the suit helmet
---
Be careful what you wish for!
---
Awesome! Thanks!
---
Please tell us about those issues, because i experienced zero issues in my 10 matches
---
Yep, same for me.
---
Go to your armor workbench look under outfits and see if you can craft the coat that comes with the package. If you can then you have purchased it. the extra Adam should also show up on your screen.
---
Definitely makes sense. Can't imagine what marsupial + frog legs would be like.
---
No, they're not bad at all. After a round where I got decent loot to start, I found out taking one out was fairly simple
---
I experience a crash here or there. It seems like, if I play for 6 hours continuously, I'll have at least one crash. I'm on PS4.
---
How do you squad up. I am on Xbox
---
who is shaming anyone?  where do you even get any of that? 
---
Im saying if the worst that guy has to deal with is having to irradiate himself again then I don't think he really has any problems at all
---
but by all means, please jump to conclusions and create faux outrage where there should be none
---
Your entire premise is based on an assumption that a person can‚Äôt possibly form an opinion of a product based on visual, audio, and anecdotal information from others who have used said product.
---
That‚Äôs as idiotic as it is flawed.  The absence of logic is astounding.  I suppose you hold exclusive rights to truth as well?
---
And people should... not complain when that happens? Thank them for a defective product?
---
Confirmed. DJ Khaled and ‚Äúwe da best‚Äù radio
---
Oh, it‚Äòs live?
---
Honestly minus the bugs which I agree were warranted of backlash I genuinely believe people just didn‚Äôt like the type of game 76 was and blew the hate out of proportion.
---
Is there a specific outfit you‚Äôve bought in the atomic shop that you can‚Äôt seem to find?
---
PlayStation store under demos
---
Stupid truly has no limits
---
Yep I got it! Thank you!
---
i am not or no mods that change perks in anyway
---
^this... the darn machines empty themselves   its getting super annoying
---
(PC) - had the same issue after some update, I couldn't hear anyone else. Try putting master volume and chat volume to max, then lower the other volumes to the level you want. That solved it for me.
---
Same problem, tried multiple weapons, card ranks, target types, no Gun fu. Hope its hotfixed and not left faulty until patch 11.
---
People get really tribal when it comes to their preferred Battle Royale game.
---
There‚Äôs so many goofy guns and equipment (as you would expect from Fallout), it‚Äôs just been a fun experience so far. Plus the majority of people have no idea what to do so it‚Äôs all fair game haha
---
The system cannot break down one-tenth of a cap so it rounds it up and the seller gets nothing. I now sell ammo at 2 caps and get my share.
---
I searched on my iPad and was able to find it under ‚ÄúFallout 76 Free Trial‚Äù as well on PlayStation store.
---
I'm not totally sure but I do not think you get any additional XP for staying in the match to watch your teamates go on. I dont think whatever placement your team gets to without you, affects you.
---
Is there anyway where we can access the vault without being in the pregame lobby. You only get like a minute to explore it which isn't enough time when holotapes are usually longer then that.
---
About a minute but after I died, I tried rejoining and its taking longer
---
I kinda like Rose as a raider radio host.  But Rose gets to invite a raider to come in to co-host.
---
I haven't tried the pharma farma card out in a while I will test this card too hopefully no others have been affected and they can fix this quickly
---
I assumed this was satire. Is it really worth trying?
---
I honestly agree with you.
---
I've never encountered it before today.  And I got it twice in an hour.  I am using a full auto tesla, so I suppose that could be part of it but also a QE railway, does that count as an explosive type weapon?  Because this is bullshit.  Not just one or two, after a certain point EVERY SINGLE enemy is invulnerable.   And you're correct the only fix is to log out and find a new server.  Fuck that shit.  And what's funny is its booting me out of vats when I "kill" them indicating they are somehow being registered as killed, but then just fill the HP right back up.  I hate it.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
appreciate the attempt.. but Ive done all that and more multiple times..
---
rn master and chat are 100% everything else is 50% or less...
---
I just cant get it working
---
Even there it does not say it's free, it only gives me the option to pay for the game.
---
I‚Äôm just glad we don‚Äôt lose anything. (Right?) I am so far from OP in PVE and PVP but a chance to play on a level field sounds fun. Now if my PlayStation would finish installing....
---
Enjoy. The weapon repair kits can be used on the fly you don't have to be at a workbench to repair a weapon with a repair kit.
---
Well that‚Äôs a heavy question if you have only played that one game in the series;  and comparing anything to Fallout 4 or Ocarina of Time is no lightweight consideration! Lol. What‚Äôs cool about coming in to one of these games after this much time, but not at the end of its cycle, is that you will likely have non-stop content for a long time because naturally there will be more in there already.  I think Fallout 76 as a taskmaster will entice that part of you that enjoyed ocarina of time.  From a look/feel standpoint it will undoubtedly satisfy your Fallout 4 side.  It is free now so it‚Äôs a great time financially to try it.  It could be a lot of newer players makes it feel one way or another.  What I can say for sure is this: if you are annoyed with something at all or something is not working to the point you are frustrated with the game, put it down.  It‚Äôs not offline like those other games, but personally I think it‚Äôs a great time to begin...well, except it‚Äôs Monday : (.
---
Then you're going to feel like a dumbass.  Because after testing a bit more there is no bug, just a broken mod.
---
womp. womp.
---
^this
---
no wont be able to do it again till tommrow
---
Two hours into my update so hopefully can finally play it soon.
---
And by blast, were you referring a grenade blowing up your face or did you get nuked?
---
Does it? I thought it was just icons in the Atom Store
---
Poop, I rely heavily on Gun Fu : /
---
At this point saying "it was a pre-war prototype" is getting a bit tired, so I'm pretty unsure about how I feel about this. It's bar none the coolest armor we've had in Fallout but... man, how many things are gonna be retconned as having actually been invented before the war and just "reinvented" when we previously thought they'd been first introduced?
---
You saved me some more testing I had just finished my second round of west tek using different weapons and I had the same result, no switch so I assume no increase in damage, i hope it's fixed quickly too if they need to do any maintenance with the BR mode
---
I agree.    
---
I think you should have to find the station so your Pip can link to it. Make sure the NPC is nothing like 3Dawg.
---
But as a bloodied ranged build you'll unlikely notice and never get hit anyway, depending on fighting tactics.
---
This ^^
---
Yeah you mark the ting in the atomic shop
---
Become a high enough rank to unlock it for adventure and survival mode?
---
No you should probably just not bother. Because clearly nothing has changed.
---
Now I can't find a match :(
---
They‚Äôre both bad games
---
No. It really was that bad. You just have a really high tolerance for bullshit.
---
It was one of my favourite perks when clearing west tek :/ helped me build a nice bonus during SBQ fights too.
---
By the look of levels needed to access stuff it‚Äôll take lvl 101 to get
---
No clue, I was talking about console trophies/achievements rather than in-game ones
---
Add him to team before you join any session
---
The fact he admitted to the deserved criticism.....and waited for the response says a lot.    
---
Hines should have had is a\*\* out there too.    
---
I've played 3 rounds of the BR. My skills aren't good for that kind of thing. It is quite interesting.
---
Yeppers! Got until the 17th to try it out!
---
Inside the vault says it's about 20 min, that's on par with every other battle royale game, including Fortnite.
---
It only seems shorter because you die to quickly. Improve your skillset and with a bit of luck, you might get to play longer. 
---
That is the nature of Battle Royale.
---
The time should be shorter and Vault 51 should be able to be explored in Adventure mode.
---
They mentioned in the patch notes that mods would be disabled for NW, I'm curious how they're going about this...I'd say its probably tripping out on the custom.ini settings
---
I just got in one! What's the gameplay like?
---
You can, I can choose my hat, my face gear (glasses,masks, bandannas etc) and also the skins to my PA and weapons
---
I've been reading that they are player icons and or skins for your stash box in adventure mode I believe.
---
Most battle royale games have that. Probably testing player connections and such.
---
And you're talking to someone who feels the same way, yet offered to play with you.. the best way to deal with anxiety is to not let it control you, in any way possible. This is literally the best way possible. You found someone you have things in common with, figure it out together.
---
Never played PUBG, but I totally had a flashback to matchmaking in Halo 2.... I may have been out of the gaming game for a long time üòÖ
---
The bird is mine!
---
Lol, I appreciate  the thought. I'd still enjoy looking at it to see what people are using at max efficiency :) Maybe get some ideas.
---
Glass canons go pop real easily, you pay for low health and lose lots of brown bags.
---
if that‚Äòd be the case, i‚Äòd understand. but my mods are working, it‚Äòs just the camera setting that‚Äòs giving me a CTD. so weird
---
Everyone starts off with nothing. The circle gets smaller after so much time. I lasted at best 8 1/2 minutes. I got to use Grognak's axe for the first time.
---
Nice thread showing yourself to be whats truly worth a sad trombone...
---
PC. I'm not asking for like ... babysitting though. I just would like to function on my own better :)
---
looks like we got our answer!
---
Those players might be playing for the first time and need to gather relevant information or to set perk cards etc.
---
Also the hellfire armor has been datamined. It wasn‚Äôt a thing till 2277. They are just putting back in a bunch of old assests from 4.
---
It‚Äôs not ‚Äúamazing‚Äù but it‚Äôs better than I expected
---
And you were correct
---
I've done a few runs.. once I had a team of 3 people and we got 1st.. and the other we had 4 and got 1st again... big difference
---
Just got done 6-7 rounds of Nuclear Winter. Not a fan of battle royal type games but be damned if it isn't a good time.  It needs some tweaking to be sure but out of the box it's still really fun.
---
On PC, hit the /
---
It is for BR fans. Problem is anyone else is just gonna get steamrolled and feed these players. The whole thing is very "niche" in that sense but I fully understand that this game mode was not made for me.
---
&gt;It would make sense to unlock them via the BR mode so people have another good reason to play 
---
No. It's bad enough that they locked an entire story behind Fortnite 76 and earning "Overseer XP". If they did that with dozens of new perk cards... I'd honestly be considering retirement after 660+ hours. 
---
They were going in the right direction with the unique weapon rewards for Survival. This is a giant leap backwards.
---
I wouldn't say it's better but it could/will be in the future.
---
Bethesda announced last night during E3 that human NPCs would appear in the upcoming DLC Wastelanders.
---
My furious SMG went between 28 and 33 damage. It stayed at 33 after changing targets, too. Idk if the damage is bugged or if the display is bugged, because it seems to actually be increasing damage to the enemy
---
Have headset on PS4. No one speaks or listens.
---
Yep hope to see a shorter wait. I love you chose your spawn and go, but 3-4 mins between matches is rough
---
Oh so there‚Äôs a significant downside
---
Just rename your custom.ini to anything else, easiest way.
---
Go to a train station and look at the posters there
---
I cant wear my plague mask and a hat..
---
I had similar problems. Switching to full screen from windowed full screen made a big difference, and turning off depth of field made it playable.
---
Correct, as you level your overseer lvl up, new rooms unlock, etc.
---
I'd like to know as well
---
Never liked a BR before until now. The Wasteland looks the right place.
---
Then we need Baby Shit Green PA paint as well.
---
Player icons and stash boxes, you get a box icon at rank 4 and a stash box at rank 5
---
Yeah I‚Äôm not new lol I just didn‚Äôt see the outfit in the atom shop cause I had to reload them game :)
---
What have you done???? That‚Äôs the skin I use.
---
XP and caps for sure. I haven't seen anything else really. A photo frame?
---
Hey there! Haven‚Äôt been on this sub in a while, this is a dumb question but by scope delay do you mean you‚Äôll hit your respective trigger for the scope and it just wont come up? And sometimes once scope does come up, the screen gets stuck in scoped view? Cause this was happening last week after I re-logged in last week, and it wouldn‚Äôt go away after a hard reset and uninstall. So I just gave up for the mean time til hopefully it got patched. Hoping this is the patch!!
---
But what does the box do?
---
Its more of a loading screen simulator I stuck at battle royal and aside from that the clunky controls makes it even worse.
---
Never saw a reason for survival to begin with, hardly anyone wanted it.
---
Thanks dude like I‚Äôm not sure what the yellow and blue crates mean when you level up though
---
Kill the sheepsquatchy.
---
To infinity, and beyond!
---
It made the world feel like it changed and developed
---
