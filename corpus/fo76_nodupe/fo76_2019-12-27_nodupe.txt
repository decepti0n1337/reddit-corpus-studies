It was not ignored, it was removed my moderators.

---
This should have been a clue that this type of question is an issue for this subreddit.  
---
Most likely it was removed for being an uncivil post.  Usually these types of questions cause people to fight, so they get removed rather quickly.

---
Ohhhhhhhh here comeses the spellering po-lease
---
Dude you are really fun. I'm glad I get to meet atleast 1 idiot a day. Thank you for the satisfaction
---
I've got a few of them, I can only guess htey drop from enclave events. Usually Dropped Connection Events. I've been doing them to get the Enclave plasma pistols to just scrap and learn the plans.
---
I don’t even play this anymore and this is unacceptable.
---
Yes, except for anyone that posts a thread on Reddit asking if they fixed it without using the search option, for you it’s way worse now. 
---
Now hackers can upload and email all your porn to your mom or boss. 
---
I’m sorry, someone should have told you.
---
are you looking to start a fight.  Because everything  you have said thus far is indicitive of someone wanting to start a fight.
---
Fooled me twice, can't get fooled again!
---
Yeah, I played from WotLK to Cata, dropped it when Mists hit. Been playing FF14 for a while, but decided to unsub for a while.
---
DayZ, that's the main game I play for a similar experience to 76, although it's buggy as hell, it's one of the few games that gives me that feeling.
---
Terraria was one of my favourite games before I had the internet, since there was more choice than Minecraft in gear and designing bases.
---
There was also the white plush carpet (on display at my camp, third floor, XB1)
---
Same for me on Xbox. No wrapping paper at vendors for several hours and no Scorchy Clauses during that time - but my Santatron was still working.
---
All fixed now on Xbox.
---
Welcome to the game! I strongly suggest scrapping EVERYTHING early game.
---
my google news feed works pretty well. It's seems to revel in Bethesda misery.
---
Like the post-war baby boomers?
---
I got the reference (I think), just not the intention, thanks for letting me know.
---
I must have missed that one, thanks for pointing it out.
---
Good work! Kinda tired of actual misinformation spreading around.
---
Has this been fixed?
---
Thats the aim of the game boiii, when you’re a high enough level with good gear mobs just aren’t threatening. I’m a ps4 player and am super stoked for rust coming out next year.
---
Hopped outta yer armour didn't ya?
---
I believe I received it an hour or so later
---
Yeah, avoid creatures that do a lot of damage or have a damage over time effect (like poison or a bleed effect). They will take you right past mostly dead to completely dead.
---
Are those perks or weapons?
---
What did you do to get it to work?
---
I've felt since the beginning that the extreme hate the game receives is a meme that got out of hand. Don't get me wrong, there have been plenty of mistakes from Bethesda, but the sheer "who can be more outraged" "Who can hate bethesda the most" posts/articles/videos come from meme origins.
---
I have big sad. I am out of town until after the event ends. I really want those head mounts.
---
Yeah.  Small 700
---
Medium 1200
---
Large 1500
---
Oh so they can't add things to other players inventories anymore? Sweet!
---
It’s not just games journalism, it’s all journalism outside of a handful of major, highly reputable publications. The only thing that matters to the companies that employ these writers is clicks. They don’t really care how they get them, they just care that they do. Writers who generate more clicks, generate more revenue and subsequently get more work. 
---
Most writers are freelance, so they need to churn out as much content as possible to make a living under this new business model. It doesn’t make it ok for them to be so lazy, but it is important to understand why it’s happening. 
---
Support quality content, pay for that content when possible, share it with friends as well. It’s the only way to help good writers and responsible journalists get ahead.
---
Just waited. Nothing appeared, and then I went to my Atom Shop and saw that I owned the sleeping bags.
---
Bloodied melee is king for dmg but if u want range, go bloodied stealth commando.
---
It's definitely RNG but it's heavily weighted towards the suppressor being a lower chance.  It's nice when you luck out!
---
Yup looks like it’s fixed!
---
Love this post.
---
Enough of this. Yes! It’s been fixed, and yes you’re a lazy asshole that can’t use a search function.
---
Some highly regarded moron on YouTube was going on about lawsuits due to people losing their gear, really??
---
Had to reply against that crap. Just amazes me how many people eat it up &amp; believe its true because the moron who doesn't check facts, lies &amp; exaggerates said so.
---
amen brother!
---
Did you have to claim it within the atom store as well? Or did it already show unlocked?
---
Do you recall if the twitch link was the first time you linked it? Or was it linked before?
---
It actually was not working for about 5 hours today. Not misinformation. Just an issue that's now been fixed.
---
Lmao, this made me chuckle. Thank you
---
I have too and not even listed in my vendor so just lmk when you have caps
---
What do you mean by saying juice head is only interested in a tiny portion of that world?
---
This comment is justified! It needed to be said!
---
This post wasn't about protecting Bethesda. In defense of the game a bit, sure, but moreso in defense of the playerbase and in defense of accuracy. I've seen too many misleading articles and far too much reddit sourcing in the last while.
---
You’re going to get a write up from kotakus transgendered autistic disabled writers about how your toxic and deserve to be cancelled.
---
Like he’s not I retested in soccer lol
---
Don't need real defenses when they can just remove pvp from the game, like they did.
---
I must also remind you that true White Knighting is fixing your armor cheaper.
---
Why waste time on this shit game?
---
Well, I'm getting rid of all the ammo cause of the weight. Acid or flux is the new king for 1st subscribers if you ask me. But for most 5.56.
---
Wow that's unbelievable! Just makes it more sad to see all the hints of survival mode that they left behind 😢
---
There just isn't enough people on board yet. Plus item for item trading would have to be a thing. The trading system needs a rework similar to previous titles where you put all you want up for trade, then both parties accept the final trade as opposed to item for cap trade how it is now.
---
as a 1st subscriber, I would never get rid of acid or flux.
---
And none of my 1st crew would either.
---
We hoard it.
---
Thank you gramma police, without you I wouldn't know how to make proper sentence structure! My day is complete
---
I can assure you that "Must" is too strong a word. I just hit 1,100 hours on 2 seperate accounts
---
Make sure to thank the coder who went in at night to fix things.
---
You purchased the game
---
The video featured in my video wasn't from ErectBan. I keep seeing people post this and it is misleading. As far as I know ErectBan didn't release any footage 
---
The original source of the video shared it in a small private group first (which I am in) as proof that the hack works. Then they decided to share it around to spread the word. I asked them to demonstrate it again for me in my video later on and test some other stuff like ATX and quest item stealing
---
You sure about that?
---
Must be.   
---
I took 10x Workshops around lunch time Eastern, on my Private server, on the PS4, not one gift over a 2 hour period.  I was getting gifts last night with no problems.  Gave up after my sister arrived for a visit.  So this was a REAL issue
---
If it's working again then it's been fixed.
---
I had to link the account, and it auto claimed everything.
---
I run a bloodied pistol/melee build and love it. I have a bloodied ffr 10mm/ bloodied black powder pistol with +10% dmg while aiming, BE pipe revolver and a BE western revolver. Love all 4!
---
I have various other be weapons for the character and they all work well.
---
Theres no armor penetration mods/perks for the pistols, so if you're not junkies or bloodied then aae or as ffr would probably be your best bet!
---
This guy gets it
---
Why am I not a reliable source? In this instance I heard of a hack, saw video of a hack, and then went to the video sources and asked them to reproduce it to be 100% certain it was as bad as it seemed before covering it
---
What would you change lucky break out with?
---
I did notice an increase in legendary non event scorch during the event
---
The best police money can buy
---
Wait, why you raging at this dude for? Not challenging you, just curious
---
I think I know what's up then. Sounds like account linked before the drops dont work and need to be unlinked and relinked through the portal from twitch prime.
---
Thx for the info/deats
---
Thanks again man, you have a good one too.
---
It's not, it's morally wrong but we are living in a world where right and wrong are very subjective and even less respected.
---
Just found my first one after being on a afternoon. So its good now.
---
They stopped on ps4 for maybe an hour or two but yeah there will be videos about the sky falling end of  the world shit
---
Alpha code is 75272864
---
38 has been free scorched killin for the event at least.  They drop as much or more than I put in them!!
---
&gt; the video itself only shows about 30-40 players being hacked. The 500+ bit comes from the hacker at the end, a claim that is not substantiated in any way. 
---
The video also shows the same people being robbed multiple times. It blows my mind that anyone took that 500+ number as fact.
---
There’s places you can build where enemies rarely spawn
---
I used to love this game, but they aren't worth defending, the servers are a mess and the game ran smoother during the B.E.T.A than it does now! The game chugs even on private servers, no way it'll handle extra npcs without a complete rework of the engine!
---
FYI You need the keyword to decipher (which isn’t available yet). Anyway someone posted the code.
---
Usually have to delete 2 or 3 things before I can place anything, can't even replace what I scrapped!
---
It does, I use it on my BE 10mm.
---
Its a beast.
---
I'm not sure what they're going for either I'll post a price check and find out
---
Level 20-30 is the toughest part of the game. Chances are you want to do story missions in areas you’re a bit underleveled for. I recommend spending some time in the coal mining area (south-east) or the toxic valley (north east). Neat places to explore and enemies are a bit closer to your level there than heading west- those sections of the map can have very high level enemies that make it tough. If you’re stuck, maybe see if someone higher level can help carry you through a tough area
---
You may be rite, but that would be the only pistol with anti armor mods.
---
Fucking despise yongyea content lol its just ridiculous
---
Tip 1: refund the game
---
Tip 2: dance
---
There's a chance to get plans when you craft a gift and open it.
---
500 atoms and a free hour in the ball pit.
---
Yea if 1:1 would be ideal for anything that you scrapped
---
Maybe we will 😘
---
Games Journo disingenuously reporting on a game? Fascinating stuff there. 2014 called, they wanted me to tell you that nothing is new here.
---
Me too, used to be much more of a thing, but some of us still do it.
---
They are both instanced and shared containers. Others can see what the overstayer has dropped and see what you drop in them. I’m not sure how long the items persist. I would expect it’s like any other container.
---
A few players out of thousands if not millions. 
---
532 out of even 100,000 is less than 0.5% if its 1,000,000 its 0.05%
---
This is one of the best posts I've read on Reddit in a very long time. As an older gamer it gives me some hope seeing that there are still other people who value true journalism. Facts still matter to me.
---
Or you could change your point of view. You can go from third person to a first person view which can also help with aiming to shoot. Plus you can also zoom in to use gunsights.
---
Awesome!
---
People were warned about the inventory hack a couple of days before and the software was only publicly available just shy of 24 hours on pc before it was patched.
---
I was on about 3 hours ago and I was getting presents from my santatron and vendors were selling wrapping paper
---
Can you link your build? It sounds really neat 😊
---
He also doesnt bother to do any research like when the video of the hacker stealing peoples inventorys appeared he said that acctually in the video 500 people were targeted when really it was about 30 with the guy claiming to have done it to 500 off camera
---

It's a thing :)
---
If you’re not using vats then a 10mm two shot explosive could be good. 
---
I’ve had a lot of fun using a 10mm instigating ffr, bloodied 50/25 vats, and a quad explosive. 
---
I would love a 10mm quad ffr 25 vats!
---
I am shocked. Very concerned. I am worried about Games Media and the quality of the writing bullshit. Gosh dang it!
---
I have three accounts on PC and this reliable works. You are doing somthing wrong. Have the player add you and then you add the player. Works every time.
---
Polygon and Kotaku are and their staff are not journalists.
---
They're glorified bloggers looking to create impressions for their online ad host.
---
Their mission isn't to report on news. It's to sell ads.
---
I understand, and will try again.
---
I and a friend went to wavy Willard’s to try Revives , my buddy kept getting too much damage no matter what we tried and went straight to Respawn, an encrypted event went off about when we got tired of trying. At encrypted the Bots  downed him in the pool by cabin and I got the Revive in .🤷‍♂️😅
---
Lol nope 35c
---
https://nukacrypt.com/
---
Let's say the game is going to co tune fir 2 more years. Theres going to continually be more camp items. We dont have an unlimited camp budget,  so your gonna have to deal with it.
---
The first reports of people actually being hacked was roughly 18 hours or so before the hot fix was released by Bethesda. You might be thinking about people spawning items into the game. 
---
I was actually surprised by how fast Bethesda reacted once the hack went live. Especially with most people being on holiday.
---
Oh...
---
That will save me some caps.
---
So, you want people to still call out that 76 is a shit show yet also tell the media that it’s not as shit as players say? The media is always horrible and usually unchecked, but I don’t see the real bad side here honestly. 
---
We still need to band together and get Bethesda to listen for once. The media, despite inaccuracies that you state, wants Bethesda to either listen for once or continue to break them down till Bethesda listens. I don’t think the best move for us is to attack the media that is, for the most part, on our side. Enemy of my enemy is my friend and such.
---
Don't forget we had to explode the legendaries body in order to loot back then.
---
* Item
---
Is this a possible allusion to the fact she may be about to push you off a cliff? Either way, loos awesome dude!
---
God yes. It would make the greenhouse 10 times more useful FFS. As it is, it's just a decoration piece. But not only that...we could finally wall in our crops and keep enemies from destroying them.
---
nice, thanks, packrat gone then, ok ok
---
My tip is before leveling up make a nukesdragons perk card build and figure out if you want to be melee or not and bloodied or not, I’ll leave a link and I actually don’t mind making you one based on what you want to play as if you want
---
Who was that?
---
I appreciate the effort you've put in to citing articles directly and calling out the mistakes and inaccuracies. I find a lot of the 76 haters who don't play are just jumping on a negative headline. It's not constructive but people just want to point and laugh I guess
---
Um... what?
---
Bethesda should find the IP's of these exploiters/hackers and send them some personalized updates via the launcher with a computer melting virus or two.  Maybe the bastards will learn not to sew chaos when they are crying like babies over their destroyed computers.
---
As for the video with 500 people stolen from it, I heard it shows only 30 and claims that over 500 were stolen from...so that is shaky proof.  Regardless, this wasn't handled right.  Would have been more honorable to shut the servers down on Saturday when the hack went live until it was resolved (since they, admittedly, were fast in patching it...took a day or two).
---
So unfortunate for those who were affected, regardless of the number.  It's like Stalin said, 1 death is a tragedy, a million is a statistic.
---
Get that guy a puppets.
---
So lucky! I ended up getting two friends.
---
Anyone wanting an easy solution, if you have two friends. Have one join your team and get them downed by you other friend. Easy.
---
Thanks for comments :)
---
Can confirm, PC is still good for a while yet. Though I saw another post claim restarting PS4 and FO76 brought the content back. Hopefully it is sorted soon!
---
ok that you, gonna tune it a bit
---
I like using it as a honey pot
---
Drop it in a obvious open location, wait for some sucker to hop it, pop em' full of lead when they realize it doesn't have a fusion core
---
I am not asking for unlimited I'm asking just to have a bit more
---
Craft a gift?
---
If you actually think the game ran better during the beta you are delusional.
---
i recommend maxing out container searching perks in luck. endless source of food, water and meds. this resulted in 100 pounds of my stash being taken up by stimpacks so i got the perk to reduce chem weights to counter it. as well as that i got the ammo weight reducing perk so that i would have more stash space as well. have fun
---
I have an AAE black powder pistol, if you're interested in it. I'm on ps4
---
Yeah it did, sure it crashed more but it sure didn't lag as much as it does now!
---
It absolutely runs smoother now, during the beta the game constantly lagged and crashed. Did you actually play the beta?
---
I have a lot of duplicates if you're on the xb1.  I've collected them while trying to get those damn icicle lights.
---
thank you, hey what about “first aid” and “pharmacist” are those as useful as they sound?
---
The gift drops were not happening on the PS4 around lunch time Eastern.  I had 10x workshops going on my private server for 3vhours with no gift drops.  Also, not one scotch Santa at any of the workshops or defend events.  
---
So there was a real issue fir at least a few hours on the PS4.  Just because it's been fixed doesn't mean that it didn't happen.
---
What happens if a deathclaw and a sheepsquatch have a baby?
---
Yup, had the beta key, didn't play the first week of the beta because well that was Midnight in my country, but the second half of the beta I took part on, the current version of the game chugs so bad it's just not worth playing anymore! Playing on PS4 Pro!
---
I was completely blind to how much sensationalism existed in gaming news until the launch of this game. Whatever happened to the days of Blast Processing and 32 more the bits?
---
That would have been honest at least.
---
Uno like what happens if you do something and that something at the same time. Uno what i mean
---
The first week the game was awful, and I’ve heard a lot of issues with the ps4 and fallout for some reason. I’m on Xbox and I don’t have a ton of issues.
---
Hell, don't even just call out shitty sites and articles. Call out the main sub. There was a huge topic on r/Fallout just yesterday acting like the hack was still in the game and hadn't even been acknowledged yet.
---
Deathsquatch jr
---
Okay but a little but more isnt a solution cause they are going to keep adding stuff throughout the life of the game. Your not going to be able to display everything.
---
My biggest problem is that issues with FO76 exist. But the hyperbole trying, seemingly, destroy the game because it isn't their Goldilocks of the Fallout series is just ridiculous sometimes.
---
The two daily quests for the tadpoles can reward badges. I got one from each of them today. So make sure you are doing those every day.
---
Sometimes if you server hop a lot when you play it will trigger one of them again so sometimes you can do those dailies more than once a day.
---
Paid shills are absolutely a thing. Many companies use them. That Bethesda is one such, I have no doubt.
---
Oh, i have the flexibility to change to unarmed, which is great.
---
So 3 perception would be enough?  Move 3 into agility?
---
Just checked it's 
---
S:15 P:9 E:4 C:5 I:5 A:10 L:8
---
Far from being min/maxed. Strength lets me swap heavy, shotgun and melee. Perception is all rifle. Endurance is for lifegiver. Charisma, lone wanderer and rank one tenderizer. Intelligence is gunsmith. Agility is action boy, adrenaline and dodgy. Luck is bloody mess, class freak and starched genes for a bunch of mutations. Important ones are speed demon, adrenal reaction and marsupial.
---
I play low health and occasionally swap in need rage and some other stuff if I really want to do damage.  It could definitely be better but it works well.
---
&gt;Where do you get the information that search lights improve range and accuracy of turrets near it. That sounds like conjecture.
---
I can give you anecdotal evidence only, though I do seem to recall reading it on a post way back when as well:
---
I'm located a short distance from WesTek and also close to the radio telescopes. Without the searchlight my camp used to get wrecked by super mutants and scorched regularly. A while back I installed the searchlight between a missile and a heavy laser turret and none of them even get close now. It definitely seems to make a huge difference for my camp
---
Can confirm that I had no idea it wasn’t working
---
I boot up the game for a couple of hours every other week, it hasn't improved yet, but I'm trying ot give it a chance, they just really need to focus on stability!
---
The game has been out for over a year already with no real big content added yet.
---
Here's an idea: Bethesda could care enough about quality to actually do QA, as opposed to foisting that on their customers. Then they wouldn't have the much deserved negative attention.
---
It was absolutely more than one dickhead
---
&gt;It’s pronounced: Mhmhmrmhmhmrrgggmmmmurrrggghhhhrrrrhhhrrr
---
Or just Mumbles. 👍🤷‍♂️
---
Agreed, if the game was a little less laggy it would be so much better. If I remember right Bethesda has a bunch of performance and stability fixes coming with wastelanders.
---
Yep, I keep hoping Bethesda will increase the budget some more.  Feels a bit too low imo
---
Wikipedia is not a source. If we cited that in class we would have been docked for failure to cite source
---
They need to prioritise the stability over wasteland era, as mostly one is likely to counteract the other!
---
I would put us at a DEFCON 2 right now
---
Would this be better?

---
What happens if you ask if the PC hack has been patched yet?
---
I think only once did my camp defenses actually preform the needed task and 3 of the 4 turrets where destroyed. Honestly I feel like camp def (Minus traps for players trying to steal my gifts) only serve as aesthetics.
---
It happened to me right after the daily challenges reset and I was switching servers.  Thought it was busted so kept playing, once I saw posts I restarted the console and everything was back to normal.  Maybe if I would have restarted sooner then it wouldn’t have seemed like such a big “deal”.

I read somewhere that wastelanders is a completely different build of the game, that’s why we had the issue with 250 dr bug. They put all of these bug and performance fixes into that build.
---
If Survival came back, and without the fast travel limitations, it would be the only 76 I would play. Not for the PVP but the thrill as you stated.
---
Learn? They have learned. They have learned that people will tolerate this and keep giving them money anyway.
---
 if you keep supporting them, they wont ever CARE.
---
Pointing stuff like this has brought me several death threats in the pms for liking the game.
---
The game broke so badly that people were robbing you from across a city.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
The game has broken so many times this year that I'd struggle to recall every time it did. If they dont get every detail right, it might be because it's hard to parse the specifics when Bethesda wasnt even clear if the patch had actually fixed it
---
I'm just saying I'll take what I can get even if it's not much
---
So, Trump is right? #fakenews
---
Yeah sure thats real
---
grats that X-01 is very nice
---
The BOS vendor sells tje plan fpr the vendor in the Whitesrpimgs. Just craft some and scrap em.
---
You shouldn't care this much about dumb video game stuff my dude.
---
Having things on display also is a budget eater in itself. Those and turrets use up a good chunk you basically have to decide whether you want to show off or defend yourself or try a half assed attempt at both lol
---
Been thinking about buying 76 for a while. What happens if I do?
---
How do you guys still defend a game that's had all its promises broken about what it would be, then slapped a monthly fee on?
---
Pirate outfit goes well with them
---
It's weird how it's balanced like so, really. I think the intention was simple really, they wanted to limit how much 308 you can craft for rifle builds (since early on hunting rifle uses 308s) and once you're crafting ultracite 308s you're probably mass producing them for the MG42. Course I'm also pretty sure the primed hunting rifle uses prime 308, but it's not like anyone really uses a prime hunting rifle over a 50 cal version anyway. Plus the hunting rifle scales pretty badly into lategame too.
---
It didn't break, it was purposfully hacked, and they patched it in a day. Let's burn bethesda hq to the ground.
---
Is “the truth” too much to ask for.  You don’t need to make things up and be hyperbolic when the situation is as much of a shit show as it is now.
---
Feck yeah. I fell like god in it.
---
Santatron and scorched are working on xb1
---
the internet did way more damage to this game than bethesda ever did. (Well FIrst was shitty but people had lost all expectations at that point anyway).
---
meanwhile i can be fighting enemies near my base and my turrets give zero fucks or if they do they shoot the enemies them immediately start shooting my base
---
I don't have any turrets because where my camp is there are no enemies so that helps with the budget, also I don't have a huge intricate camp with everything displayed no I just have a few little knick Knacks that I found cool displayed
---
Thanks but I'm on PC :(
---
i was playing maybe 2 hours ago and was farming them
---
You'd think the hate train would've ended by now. But the fact that this game is still growing, means it wasn't a complete failure.
---
Meh, they should be tweaked.
---
They should be normally effective during the day, and just better during the night. Having them be worse during the day is just so bad that they’re not worth using. Especially since we can’t control what time of the day we play, like in fallout 4.
---
Mod it up now!!!
---
One was LegacyKillaHD I believe. He addressed it at the end of the video, based on a reddit post. He also heavily implied that the video from the hacker showed 500+ people being hacked, and made it seem like stolen atomic shop items in your inventory were gone for good. Not sure what he was talking about there. Would be difficult to steal a recipe unlock permanently.
---
Now that will be something!
---
This is my melee build. It's a stealth, anti armor melee build, built around swing speed, anti armor weapons, and vanguard armor, with ap refresh to maximize the use of dodgey. It works wonders, and has high survivability. Feel free to use it.

[Fallout 76 Build with 15/3/5/6/5/11/11](https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/planner/#Aw4CBAUECgoBAQEAJHcDeAN5A1YDswEDfgOCAQULA1kB1QEBDwVPA0AFPwPwAQPEAQNRAzYCAA==)
---
What do you think of this?
---
Yes, you can absolutely swap out slugger for gladiator later on. My melee character has the perks for unarmed too, depending on mood. 
---
If you’re going two handed you’ll want to find Weapons with a swing speed legendary effect, as that is the downfall of two handed, especially if you’re swarmed by a mob. 
---
You really really need to put more points into agility. You’ll need some sneaking or sprinting- especially if you’re playing bloodied which your build suggests. You also want agility for power attacks.
---
No. I don’t understand what you mean. 
---
And somehow, I understand even less that at the beginning.
---
First off, any video game you play makes you a gamer. Not counting mobile games because they're different...but Sims counts.
---
So what platform are you on? Guessing PC since you don't play video games other then Sims...which is good. It means you can mod the game...slightly. It also means I can tell you what keys to press to get menus and such.
---
So let's start out with the real basics that you'll need to survive. A camp. It sounds like you have a shack built. You'll want to use a bed as often as you can while you're a low level...it slowly heals you up. Craft a water pump, it's the most basic water item, it'll give you dirty water but for two dirty waters, you get one boiled water. Boiled water is used it almost all recipes. The major recipes you'll want to focus on are soups. Soups heal, and they fill your hunger and water bars. It will give you rads though so make sure you have some Radaway for later on when the rads take up a fourth of your health bar. 
---
Another useful recipe is vegetable starch, but that's for crafting. See almost everything in game needs glue. So you need to make a glue farm. When your running around, keep an eye out for corn, mutfruit and tato plants. Flatwoods has tato and mutfruit plants. No corn though. I can't remember a closer place to get corn other then Silva homestead which is quite a bit of a walk from Flatwoods. The bonus is there's a workshop next door that has a ton of Razorgrain that can be made into soup.
---
Speaking of workshops, unless you're on a private server or in a fairly empty server, avoid workshops...if you take one over, someone can come along and PVP you for ownership...and high levels love to do this. They'll sneak up and kill you in one shot. I'm a level 135 and I was still getting killed in workshops at level 120 or so...so I stopped taking them over unless I'm alone. The bonus of a workshop is you get resources/plans. Resources can be pretty useful...if you hold the workshop for a long time (this is where private servers are super handy). Otherwise just running around grabbing junk is better. But plans...you get a lot of plans if you just take over workshops. Plans can be for armor, weapons or camps. I think workshop plans are almost always going to be camp items. When I was lower level, I would just take over the workshop next to Silva homestead, and then server jump as soon as I got my reward. That would mean I could farm plans fairly easily.
---
Anyways, most of the basic plans you need for survival, you'll get by doing the main quest. You'll get a lot of useful stuff doing the main quest actually so I suggest to stick to it as well as the Responder quests...at least at first.
---
So by now you should have a decent camp setup that lets you heal and fill your hunger/water bars. That's the basics...keeping your bars filled and yourself healed. 
---
For your character, play around with this: https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks
---
It shows you all the perks in the game and you can make various builds to see what build you'll want to end up with. By build I refer to your character. Are you going to be a high damage output user, with low defense (we call that a glass cannon), or are you going to be a high defense, low-medium damage output (we call that a tank). Or what weapon will you focus on...pistols? Shotguns? Rifles? Melee? There's a ton of choices and tons of builds you can do. Honestly you don't really need to worry about the finer details until you hit level 30...then you need to start thinking what you're going to specialize in.
---
It sounds like you're having a hard time with shooting though, so you'll want to use VATS. It's an in game helper that helps you focus on one enemy at a time. If I remember right most VATS builds focus on Perception...but I could be wrong. Use the above link to figure out what perks give VATS bonuses/are useful.
---
Oh something else, when you're running around collecting things like junk...you want to keep your eyes open for certain scrap items. I find adhesive, oil, springs, screws and gears are the most useful. So in your Pipboy, you'll want to go to the junk part and I believe hit C to get the component view. In there it'll show you the scrap items, hit Space to mark which ones you think are useful. It'll put a little icon next to whatever junk item has something useful in it. It's just a good thing to use for keeping your junk/scraping efficient...since you have limited Stash space. And always scrap everything at workbenches when you see them. Don't put junk into your Stash unless you scrap it first! Scrapping saves space.
---
Played on xbox. An hour ago
---
Was in glass cavern mining ultracite and scorched.
---
For a handful of xmas scorched.
---
Spawns have been changed and plans gifts five are also worse than when it started
---
I prefer Dodgy to White Knight, especially w Action Boy. Armor doesn’t break that quickly, and the mats aren’t that hard to find and store.
---
You may want to consider Sun Kissed, Fireproof and rad resist instead of Iron skin depending on your armor
---
this is inaccurate. Spotlights makes the turrets target fire if the spotlight has a lockon. it doesnt extend the range of them at all. they all abide by the same bad line of sight and hitboxes like everybody else
---
I wonder if there is an old school nuclear threat level system that could be used for this
---
You should definitely play the other Fallout games too, if you liked this game chances are high that you'll like Fallout 4, Fallout 3 and New vegas are very different, and fallout 2 and 2 are turn based 1.5d games, but im having a blast playing those.
---
That 500 number assumes that the dude in that video is the only person doing it and that he stopped doing it outside of that video. He wasn't and he didn't, he's just one single example, so that percentage doesn't work at all. 
---
Also if you think that millions of people, or anywhere near, are still playing F76 you're kidding yourself.
---
It's cool, don't sweat it!   If no one ever told you, hgow would you know, right?
---
White Knight,you may need to redistribute stats. Lucky break hardly ever rocks. Without White Knight your armor will break almost daily. You need to have that on at all times if you are not running power armor.
---
wrong reporting or not the game is still a disaster, so no point in defending it let alone asking for help to do so  ffs
---
That's funny because you can't view your physical pipboy while in power armor.
---
I have icicle lights no mothman. What mounted plans do you have? Any rare?
---
I haven't had time to play much lately so I dont have much. I have some Halloween plans though.
---
I think people try to sell all of that stuff, now.
---
I don't know and I don't get it.  I mean, it's even possible to like the game and still realize the company is steering it into the ground and has lied to their customers at every turn.
---
Uno if something happens whilst another something happens like that uno what i mean
---
Refund?
---
Oh wow, another idiot.   
---
It's up \_for you\_ in \_your region\_ on \_your platform\_.   
---
People stating it's down and the items are no longer in the shop aren't wrong, it's not just one godamn server.
---
Add me on PSN D-Wall317 I have a ton of plans on sale 
---
What’s your PSN?
---
Bloodied with faster swing speed and/or Bloodied with faster fire rate
---
I remember that response, they basically claimed it was a "small number of players affected" even though the servers were practically ghost towns for 2 days because nobody was logging in for fear of getting their inventory jacked.
---
Maybe they'll give us all canvas bags and 500 atoms to cover it.
---
Slow motion? That sounds an awful lot like FO4, that's the second time it seems like you're making this story up.
---
[removed]
---
Editing is key. While it is hard to put away older atomic shop items. You can always rearrange and rebuild. Trust me I know the struggle. Especially when they added display cases. It's brutal.
---
Now go get strangler, it’s better
---
Yes, you can swap your perk cards out between unarmed, 1H, and 2H melee. Don’t be afraid to mix and match to suit your current needs. Also, there are other branches you may want to try that will complement and/or backup your melee build, such as PA/heavy guns. 
---
I have a bloodied deathclaw gauntlet/unyielding build for everyday use, a tankier PA/bloodied Grognak’s axe for when things get a little hairier (or when I’m tired of being so squishy) and a PA/bloodied .50 cal build for the SBQ. Or — maybe none of the above will work for you! But I guarantee, if/when you find the right gear, it’ll fall into place naturally for you. Good luck!
---
This was fixed Monday...
---
... they 'fixed' it a day ago.
---
I guess at least that's what they told us.
---
You know u can trust bethesda right? :P
---
Farming holiday presents has been the best thing about Christmas for me this year lol
---
Im still not trusting it it's to easy to mid it on PC
---
Thanks bro appreciate it!
---
The first article isn't bullshit, though...someone lost their equipped gear in my camp the day after the "fix" landed. Or did a very passable con job to scare people into thinking he did.
---
I hear ya. I loved dropping them for who ever cam to my camp though to buy something. I think i spent more time waiting for presents from b.e.n my Santatron so i could hand them out 😅
---
After an hour+ searching here's a better path. You take the door to the right of the DMV bots then follow the hallway through the big room with the statue. Take a right into the next hallway and the first room on the left has a walled office (filing cabinet room) that you go into. The box is on the desk next to a broken pc and is unmarked but looks cleaner than the other boxes
---
I don't know if it's fixed or not. Someone allegedly had his shit stolen in my camp (or did a very good troll) the day after the fix landed.   
---
Everyone going "bethesda patched it so you're good"...oh god bethesda patching something doesn't mean it's fixed, guys. It means we need to look for WORSE bugs.
---
*sips nuka cola*
---
Ah yes, the buzzfeed of video games.
---
Exactly. It's like they blindly support it solely because its Fallout.
---
Well-written with excellent points throughout.  I couldn't agree more and wish these "professionals" were held to account. Unfortunately this kind of shoddy journalism occurs fart too often in the mainstream media as well.
---
If it wasn't fixed, you'd still be hearing people crying about getting their gear stolen.  Plus, they said it was fixed, data miners checked it out and concluded it was fixed, and the people in the discussion where the hack initially leaked have said it's been fixed.
---
Or, it's a grand conspiracy where all the script kiddies got together and decided to lay low until YOU got back online so they could get all your gear.
---
Hello Whale
---
1k in a machine if you're lucky, 50 cal are pretty crap on their own, low level? Not worth it.
---
Subreddit: "you need to go after cheaters and hold them accountable"
---
Bethesda, clearly unable to even keep their own game functional, let alone forensically track down cheaters: *nervous sweating* we'll get right on it.
---
Wow, who pissed in your cornflakes and why the hell would bother posting on a subreddit for a game you obviously hate?!
---
If you enjoy RUST, be aware that they've stripped away (thank god) most of the griefer bullshit designed to target that audience.
---
Regardless of the poor journalism mentioned, there is no way to defend Bethesda as it is the biggest villain in the situation. Just look at the product we spend our money on.
---
**- Unstable performance:** my game crashes three to five times a day and I play with the low presets!
---
**- Hundreds of bugs:** for every 10 bugs fixed 30 new ones come up!
---
**- Atomic Shop:** Products with very expensive prices. Power armor skins, for example.
---
**- System total weakness:** hackers make the party (you well know what they did). Not any patch that will hold them. They can come back anytime with new exploits.
---
**- Griefings:** These guys simply break PvP rules (taking advantage of Bethesda's failure) and steal hundreds of players. Bethesda, of course, does nothing.
---
Bethesda only has two priorities: Atomic Shop and Fallout 1st, the rest comes later. They do not care about their customers. They treat them like trash. It is impossible to defend such a disgusting company like this.
---
Well, Legendary versions are Unicorn drops.  You can sometimes find the normal in world, and they're still solid for DPS.  I just recently learned the plan to make them, so I haven't checked if I need max Science or not...  but technically I can make them if I had the perks.
---
Like what one?
---
76 is done. 
---
Let the game die. Let Bethesda realize their folly. They won’t learn unless you let them fall. Let their next game determine their final light in their currently dark tunnel of Game development.
---
The only real answer
---
You can switch around. I started full health two handed and transitioned to unarmed bloodied. You can switch your cards at any time so when I find new weapons with good rolls I usually try them out. My best advice that works for all melee types is get scaly skin and carnivore mutations. You can stack melee boosting meat as much as you want and there are tons and tons of different meats. Deathclaw, mole chunks, Yao guai, mutant hound are just the ones off the top of my head that gives you 10+ melee each or 1+ strength. Also swing speed is great for two-handed and one handed, power attack is amazing on unarmed.
---
You only assume you are hearing it from an active member. How are people so trusting of complete strangers on the internet. What the fuck happened to everyone?
---
Yeah but my issue is it stops me when I’m running and jumping all the time. Is that the issue you are having?
---
I'd only change two things. 
---
One, scale to level of the lowest level person in the zone, not the actual zone, so if everyone at the event is 50+ we can actually get drops worth using. 
---
Two. Up the odds of the rare masks.
---
Make sure to throw on super duper and scrapper before you start crafting. Also the lowest level works to save mats.
---
Open then
---
Have you tried changing servers?
---
Will do thanks! Hope this weapon isn’t in the same league as the Radium lol
---
We do our best =)
---
Yes it's like a stutter and you even fall half way during a jump
---
Look how many times this exact question has been asked on this sub. After a while, people should be able to use a search bar.
---
I understand what you are asking for. I guess I'm saying no. Work within the constraints. It's likely we will see a camp budget increase in the future, it's a popular request.
---
No, it's nowhere nearly as bad as the radium. You may be able to also buy some of the mod plans from vendors to reduce your material costs.
---
Open them, they're in the aid section. You get a toy, an alcohol and possibly an event plan from each one
---
I have a some stuttering problems relating to movement. It's whenever my movement stops, there's a brief freeze.
---
I found out that if I take a speed demon serum, it gets rid of the problem completely (it's very obvious, I'm not imagining it) while the serum is active. It doesn't cure all my stuttering problems, just that one problem specific to movement changes.
---
Yeah when I switch servers it sometimes help but sometimes it doesn’t. I’m switching to an ssd Saturday so I’m hoping that helps a tiny bit performance wise.
---
Thanks , I do have 4 Turrets also
---
Sniper rifle is hunting rifle with appropriate mods. Sniper combat rifle is combat rifle with appropriate mods. The name of the weapon may be influenced by the receiver and other mods (scopes, stocks).
---
Man you Bethesda apologists are absolutely hilarious!
---
The point is that a hack of this nature should never have even been possible in an online game.
---
It does with a vending machine ?!
---
Thanks !
---
What platform are you on?  If you’re on Xbox I can help out.
---
Gotcha! I guess I don’t pay too much attention 😂 thanks for clarifying for me
---
Run t-51b lvl 50 armor with emergency protocols on the chest. U NEED serendipity in luck and need rage in intelligence. I usually run no PA and sneak to reduce damage taken, but railways don't work with sneak so I stopped using them. Use a handmade now.
---
Did trimming a few turrets help?
---
Bethesda hears ya! Bethesda don’t care!
---
There’ll be many many more.
---
What happens if you nuke Murgle the cat while wearing a clown suit?
---
Yes why do they shirt my own stuff? I also noticed they shoot my walls for no reason non stop
---
&gt; There’s places you can build where enemies rarely spawn
---
So  is that how you want everyone to solve this problem? Because if everyone did that,   the game would not be able to place your camp half the time when you log in because someone else's would be there.
---
The blue lights are on the small gift ?
---
Hello peasant.
---
This isn't a new problem, and it's most definitely not limited to FO76.  "Calling it out" is pointless too because the comments sections on those sites are way more toxic than Reddit.  Unfortunately overblown, careless or even deliberately misleading news for the sake of viewership is the norm.  
---
The only people who can do anything about it are Bethesda (by rebuking the inaccuracies publically) and Bethesda (by ending the tide of ammunition that they hand to their critics).
---
What? I play for the limited time rewards because it’s fun. Just because you don’t feel that way doesn’t mean I (or anyone else) should have to play your way..
---
The bullshit part was everyone talking about “over 500” people being affected when the video hardly showed even 100. Not many people watched the video and just upvoted parroted information because they were upset
---
I take over all workshops with sanats in em for hours in end for no results on it.  I wanted to do some nw to unlock winter stuff but not if i dont get the last 3 i need.  Gift wrap is crazy high in cost.  I never have caps for that grind.
---
Some servers do not have everything I have been on a few that still do not have the tattoo parlor it says future content to be add in a later date when you interact with the door
---
I feel this is one of those arguments that if people got their way all we would have is Two Shot, Instigating, Vampire, Junkies and Bloodied. Nocturnal is suppose to be terrible as it is just a place holder prefix until you get something better. 
---
One legendary that does need to be fixed Berserkers. The effect is that damage raises when your defense is lower. However the damage lowers even below the base point pending on your defense which makes it useless.
---
They are kinda, but queen nukes, when done correctly are outside the rad zone, and I carry a suit of power armor just in case of radiation zones, but I have more defenses without power armor, due to my perks,mutations, and armor, so I'm losing nothing by not using it.
---
GTAV is a shitshow of game breaking exploits to this day, is Rockstar getting the same level of hate? Counter strike has been out for 20 years and is still exploitable yet it's been a favourite franchise the whole time
---
 The point isn't that the game isn't broken, it obviously is, but the response is way out of hand on every single issue. It's just tiring.
---
In Agility I got Marathon for sprinting. How many points more into agility would you suggest? What should I take away from and what perk cards in agility do you think are best?
---
About bloodied: I keep seeing this mentioned but I am still confused as to what people mean by this phrase. Is it an effect? What perks suggest so? I’m sorry I’m still new and this game is much more complex than I thought.
---
I'd like to throw my two-cents in here, as well. I have a friend who is a "commentator" for a well known website where his articles on gaming related stuff gets *a lot* of views. He basically writes pure opinion and passes it as fact because, well, that's just what you do when you have no experience with anything but generating click bait. He'll flat out write things that are false then wait a day or two and put in a redaction or an edit to clear things up.
---
Gaming articles just don't have as much reason to be fact-checked or even fact-based because at the end of the day the generation running the economy feel that it's just games.
---
Mirelurk queen claw isn't available. 40/43 are available. Other 2 is the scorchbeasts.
---
I hope someone is keeping track of all the negative accounts. We need to challenge the courts to come up with internet advertising laws to curb this constant misuse of the sub.
---
Seriously? Calling out a few articles on the latest 76 news for being too “hard on the game” is just the lost cause and total bullshit rude this has been.
---
In what way has this game gave me a SECOND of notability when it comes to the things it promised, can’t follow through with, or try to fucking charge me MORE for on unfinished game.  Fake news, real news, where does Bethesda and the fandom draw the line?
---
I don't know if it does.  I'm saying, is there anything in there that says they can do this?  I'm not arguing with you, man, I know you're upset but I'm trying to talk you through it.
---
This is pretty much how it always is for consumers, they get theirs, you wait for yours.
---
How many dickheads was it?
---
Dear people who gave this post awards. 
---
You are the problem.
---
Exactamundo
---
I went broke doing it, but I found making marine helmets and selling them to a vendor first (maxed hard bargain grape mentats), then buying what I can in high quality wrapping paper helped me. Even if it's only 1 or 2 when you have caps or when the daily reset happens if you've got the 1400 caps and spent them it's still good, I've managed to get the paper at 1408 caps from each vendor with perks/grape mentats.
---
It's not even that many. Like I said several people get robbed more than once in the video. Magnus_Ti or whatever the name is gets robbed 3 - 4 times in the video. The fact that anyone would stick around when they've been totally robbed multiple times is also suspect, imo. Seems like he was doing this sometimes to strangers, sometimes to friends who were in on it.
---
The video is quite short and yet almost 50 people were affected, direct evidence. Is it really such a stretch to presume that number is probably quite a bit higher? He was able to do its for **days** and you think it's crazy to estimate over 500 people were also fazed by this?
---
Get real. People parrot this because they presume, incorrectly or otherwise, that these websites are doing their due diligence when making these articles. And in Bethesda's case, you really all that surprised something like this might be going on?
---
If this happened to a respectable company I'd be shocked and take the time to research it myself, but Bethesda? It's literally just another notch on their belt and I'm not expecting people to delve into the authenticity of it because they probably expect this from them. I know I do.
---
No carpet please
---
People who don't even play the game make sure they check in to see what they should be hating this week.
---
I had heard the Scorchbeasts weren't in the game and also heard it was a super rare drop from the Scorched Earth event. The 3 are the only ones I currently need! 😊
---
That’s ok! Just a great guy offering to decorate your CAMP with some mounted heads since you didn’t have the plans.
---
Gift wrap you can make you're own at a tinker workbench(double with chemist) and santatron is free in the atom shop and if built at your camp will collect toys, coal, and gifts for you. Santatron can also be built at any workshop you claim
---
Everything works like that except atomic shop items and Nuclear Winter stuff except when there is a bug, so event items like Faschnacht stuff is totally okay OP
---
The handmade gifts have higher rare drop chances
---
Thank you guys! Yes he was such a cool dude!
---
Thank you for being so detailed and informative. Bloodied sure sounds strong, but also sounds hard to manage. Do you think it’s something a first timer should try?
---
I totally forgot agility itself actually affects your stats. Thank you for that I will modify it a bit on your suggestions. Appreciate you!
---
Large gifts only?
---
There aren’t enough players who still like the game to call then out.
---
It's really ironic that in your quest for the truth, from journalists for articles you read for free, you're absolutely spineless when it comes to the never-ending deluge of abuse and dishonesty Bethesda hands us, and you actually PAY FOR IT! Yeah yeah downvote me to Hell, you know you're all full of shit.  
---
Some article was off because of a change made in 24 hours, but literally falsely advertising this game is ok and everyone else is just out to get it. Holy shit, get a god damned clue already.   
---
BETHESDA. FUCKING HATES. YOU.
---
Whoaaaa, brooo we met randomly in game a couple of weeks ago, anytime you feel like playing hit me up my guy, always down to provide some content for people
---
Bull. Shit. It absolutely was to protect Bethesda. One article is horrible because a fix went out in within 24 hours of print, but all the lies Bethesda told you regarding a product sold to you for money, doesn't get a peep from you.
---
Dude. Your comment reads as nothing more than trying to start an argument.
---
I’m still waiting for Fallout 76 to come to Xbox One.
---
A snow covered wasteland with Bing Crosby Christmas music would have been a great experience
---
Some perk cards can help with VATS lasting longer like under Agility Action boy/girl help AP points generate faster. Also get well tuned by using an instrument to generate AP faster. Since VATS use AP using perks for AP helps VATS last longer.
---
Oh so people actually sell the mutations for caps out of their CAMP vendor? I did not know that was a thing. I don’t mind spending caps I just need to make some first, haven’t grasped the economy in this game yet.
---
I’ll make sure to snag Starched Genes for when I get these cool sounding mutations. Marsupial sounds dope.
---
I am on Xbox, always appreciate more buddies as I don’t really have anyone to play this game with.
---
My gamertag: captive scholar
---
This is my PA melee loadout: [example](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=e355c98&amp;d=sb2s42ss2sm2st1pe2ed3eu0cr0c72i44s10ih2id2a72a42a12la2l71lu2&amp;w=&amp;m=&amp;nw=&amp;n=) 
---
When I want to run heavy guns, I swap out the melee cards and Martial Artist for Heavy Gunner/Expert HG/Master HG. In Intelligence, I swap Power User for Stabilized (because fusion core depletion is more manageable in short periods) and Makeshift Warrior for Gunsmith. If you have a weapon dependent on fusion cores I’d switch Power Smith out for Stabilized instead though. It’s all about finding a balance. With the Speed Demon mutation reload speeds really aren’t too bad — just reload between enemy waves or billy goat up onto high ground with the Marsupial mutation. 
---
Then for unarmed I use Blocker, Iron Fist, (both maxed) and Martial Artist in strength, Makeshift Warrior and Nerd Rage in intelligence, and usually maxed White Knight in Agility in place of Dodgy or my armor breaks way too fast. It’s not perfect or optimized by any means, but it’s working out for me.
---
Are you running the running the game in HDR10 or Dolby Vision 12?
---
What? People solo raid dungeons all the time in WoW, doesn't matter the number the gear drops from a set loot table...oh wait... making excuses for FO76...never mind.
---
How was it designed? Better gear the more players? At least one person isn't left with shit?
---
I remember getting shit upon when I made that exact same comment when a Kotaku writer said the online part of fallout wouldn't be an issue.
---
ok, how are you surviving the rads without pa for sbq? I melt like butter
---
Well if you go low health and stack unyielding it adds 3+ more strength per piece but you become very squishy. I found a happy medium with 4 unyielding 1 bolstering for damage resistance and one piece has poison resistance for bugs and lizards. I have +1 strength on each piece too so Fully boosted I’m close to 50 strength.
---
Okay, I honestly agree with what you are saying! And appreciate your stance against the media, and the half facts being presented by these groups of entertainment bloggers. 
---
Mind you, not to call  you out on armor and weapons  breaking  twice as fast. 
---
I hate to say it, I  am 2600 hrs in,  and they are breaking at an alarming rate, even with percards equipped, compared to before the introduction of the repair kits.  I could go twice as long as now, before my weapons or armor needed to be fixed. 
---
Also I  believe Bethesda loves this kind of media attention, think about it, it  keeps the game relevant.
---
 I have heard more about  fallout 76 in 2019 than any other major video game to date.
---
 Bad publicity is good for business, it keeps the name of the game fresh in peoples minds. Than Bethesda throws a free DBL XP weekend, and  free to play. 
---
You tell me you would not want to check the game out to see what everyone is talking about, good or bad. 
---
And then if Bethesda can hook 15000 new players it keeps the game going. Conspiracy theories, maybe. I think at the end of the day, it is a brilliant marketing strategy, straight out of the CIA playbook. Reverse psychology.
---
And to be honest with you, think how brilliant Fallout 76 truly is in its own right. 
---
I wouldn't put it past Bethesda to be behind some of these controversies to keep the corporate ball rolling! 
---
Nonetheless I wish you, and everyone the best.

I hope everyone has had an amazing holiday experience, and I wish everyone  the best for 2020!

Lmao

"We would like to apologize to those of you who were impacted by this exploit. We want to make this right, and we are currently looking into ways we may be able to compensate you"
---
Bethesda: here's 500 no wait 1000 atoms
---
 
---
Next patch screw up: "We would like to apologize to those of you who were impacted by this exploit. We want to make this right, and we are currently looking into ways we may be able to compensate you"
---
Bethesda: I know you all lost everything again and now are back at level 1. Over a year later with so many problems. Here's 500 atoms.
---
Kinda like Fox News
---
I have had many times loading into a public server gave me the message “Your survival tent could not be placed.”

Thank you for such a detailed reply, I see what you mean now by branching out into a hybrid type of method. It makes sense that Melee and Heavy Gunner builds are both kind of STR based so they overlap.
---
Also thanks for sharing your build. It always helps to have a visual for me!
---
Let me show you [something](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/W97AR1r)

Well that's why I mentioned properly placing the nukes.  Most skilled SBQ Nukers know to leave specific portions of the map out of the blast zone ; either V9 and the shack, or some aim higher and leave the SE plain open for people to fight upon.  Either way, when you can tell it's a well placed Nuke is by how much open room there for people to fight on the ground outside of the blast zone, drawing the Queen to hover and land where there's no rads.
---
Bloodied, explosive, anti-armor, instigating, two shot... It depends on your build. My favourite combo for a revolver is instigating + limb damage + low vats usage. My favourite for a 10mm is anti-armor + faster fire + low vats usage. 
---
I have tried them all. I have them all, in fact. I collect 10mm and revolvers.
---
You mean you agreed to let the enclave use you in their insane war against humanity today
---
Lol this game is trash and Bethesda is milking you dry. Open your eyes. The game is low quality garbage. It's not fallout
---
Little bit :) thanks for noticing
---
Lol then just play fallout 4. 76 is garbage
---
The best advice is to get a refund
---
Well some of them are. 
---
I fucking love tim rogers and jason shreier from kotaku. But that's cause they are actual journalists or just aren't the clickbait shitty journalists the site is filled with.
---
My alts survival tent has prevented another characters tent when swapping toons on a private server. I have no idea how any of it works.
---
Everyone knows the Brotherhood is the Superior faction, Your Country Needs you Enlist
---
I'm waiting for it to be free for gamespass members.
---
I just started fo4 and didn't know about those, but thanks for the info!
---
I just want double exp. maybe triple.
---
What's wrong with calling a trash game trash?
---
Pick up **EVERYTHING**, If you're walking into a strange area, that you've never been, use VATS to see the enemies around. **DO NOT** take on enemies above your level (unless you have a very powerful weapon that beats all others in it's class), pick up **EVERY** chem and healing and food item, oh and to counter all of that weight, use perks like thru-hiker which reduce drink and food weights by 30% if the perk is level 1.
---
So you just ignore the fact this does happen in games? Shit GTA Online still has this problem.
---
Your friend is employed as a commentator - an person whose entire job is to give their opinion - and you are upset that he is "passing opinion off as fact"? What does that even mean?
---
Than i question how much fighting u do bare minimum my guns need repaired once a day and my armor is broken almost all the time especially my leather peice thing is made of paper
---
I had a Campfire Tales event show up the 23rd, but after nearly finishing the event my game crashed out.
---
[Bethesda apologists hated that]
---
The rewards are fine for 3 or 4 man teams, which is the design and intent. 
---
Imo it's fine.  If you spent a ton of resources soloing the queen, should she be nerfed?
---
There is a video of it, it's linked near the top comment.
---
Something to cover the ugly roof would be nice.
---
The media isn't a monolith. Saying "overblown, careless or even deliberately misleading news for the sake of viewership is the norm" is treating every journalist and outlet the same. Some random-ass YouTuber is not the same as a full-time reporter at an actual website or the people doing games coverage at the Washington Post.
---
My strangler heart pa's disagree with this assessment.
---
They're really kind of hurting for recruitment
---
If every 10 or even 20 person lost their jobs/died/any thing else, it would be pandemonium. It is not asmall number, it's extremely disrespectful, they are like always trying to downplay the problem.
---
Well, its not actually unacceptable, is it?  I mean - you're still subbed?  Right?  So you're accepting it.
---
I admit its pretty terrible on alot of things but what else would i be playing most of the games recently have been pretty dissapointing
---
Which ones did you want? I have a few extra if you are on Xbox. Tragically no icicle lights
---
I mean, on one hand that'd be useful, but on the other hand it would be permanently stuck at DEFCON 1.
---
Seriously. The only time I can think back on when this game wasn't in active crisis mode was during the Fasnacht event. At all other times there have been consistent issues with server crashes, dupers, hackers, griefers, broken events, content that eats player inventories, stash boxes that eat crafting materials, Atom Store rip-offs, unethical business practices...
---
I guess at this point the drama is part of the lifestyle.
---
Just to be sure.
---
Windmills do NOT cause cancer.
---
So you support fake news as long as it fits your narrative gotcha.
---
Strange!  It seems to be the exact opposite for me. Just today I had to  repair my weapons twice, and  power armor once yesterday, and once this afternoon, after playing 6 hours in. 
---
It might just be a platform, or server issue? 
---
I noticed it right after the launch of the repair kits, and it has only gotten progressively worse in the last 3 months. 
---
Nonetheless I  put up with it, and try  to make the best of my time.
---
So you support fake news? Great thing to keep supporting im sure going by feels makes everything better.
---
This actually tickled me, thank you
---
&gt;I am not sure how you got the impression Bethesda could pull off a non-buggy AAA release but that mistake is on you. 
---
Probably the literal tens of millions of dollars they spent on development and marketing, I think. Saying "it's your fault that you thought the game would work" is maybe not the best defence of a developer, if you really think about it.
---
You need to run energency protocols on chest piece if running bloodied in pa, and know serendipity doesn't work in pa as well.
---
Dodgy isn't a bad idea as well as fireproof, and blocker. 
---
But the main thing is emergency protocols or death.
---
Ah yes, "the media." Let's make broad sweeping statements about the entire construction industry next. The media is bad, construction is bad. Medicine is bad.
---
I kill everything I run across. I have to regularly make more 5.56 ammo.
---
Only planters? SO many FO4, Nuka World, Far Harbor, Robot DLC and other assets should be available to build at our camps and workshops AND planters too of course :)
---
Obtainable through in game quests and missions, NOT atom store.
---
There isn't one truth to report. There are lots of different facts, from which reporters develop a narrative. The broader narrative around Fallout 76 is that it's busted. So that's why lots of stories get written about it being busted.
---
Have you ever met a journalist in person?
---
I've not noticed any increase in needing to repair anything. I run 5 star gunsmith perk with 3 star white knight. When I go into my PA I will add 2 star power patcher  (or which ever the one that slows PA degrading) and I don't have to repair my stuff very often.
---
One item, which is debatable if it's even that good, which takes seven centuries to unlock and craft, which then lags and crashes the game if there's too many of them in one spot. Okie dokie dude.
---
hahahaha haven't played this in about a year, watched this for longer than i should have. the music really sets the mood
---
Serums are a good store of value, as is violet flux. I'd always take flux over caps if selling expensive weapons or armor.
---
If $13 bucks a month is what constitutes as being a whale these days...then I'm a balaenoptera musculus
---
Which mod was that ( the last one ) ? The main 2 mods I wanted from the Radium was powerful auto receiver and suspressor. 
---
 I have unlocked all the ultracite laser mods - took about a week.
---
You should really play any other Fallout gane if you want a more interactive, interesting experoence.
---
This is just like a fallout game without the meat, and shy multiplayer elements.
---
Imagine playing the Sims, but Leveling up Skills, Moods and Building are gone. That's how crippled this game is. There is still something but...
---
Be aware if you move your camp and do not save or blueprint those items, you will not be able to rebuild them (unless you later acquire the plan)
---
Reverse
---
I have way too many display cases, but there's no other way to lock down things - if it were possible, I could take down half of them that are holding things I don't really need to see all the time but don't want to lose.
---
&gt;Theirs is a dying profession, and it arguably deserves to die if they've abdicated their responsibility to be the gatekeepers of truth.
---
In a thread of truly terrible posts, this might be the worst one. Journalism isn't dying, newspapers are dying, but I guess you'd need to read up on the media industry to know the difference. 
---
"We're at a time of unprecedented attacks on the fourth estate, one of the most important functions in a democracy. World leaders are attacking the free press and calling for the imprisonment and execution of journalists, even in the free world. Journalists everywhere are being executed for their work. But I disagree with this headline about a video game exploit so maybe we don't need them after all???"
---
Yeah not really, if even Free-To-Play MMO's can do faster. There is literally no excuse, the decided the transaction service.
---
Would be helpful.  I saw a level 14 or so in just his skivvies tonight and panicked that the hack was back.  I already check here all the time, and also right before playing, but it shows that trust is pretty damaged for me right now.
---
I put the truth in quotes for a reason. 
---
But it’s a pretty basic tenant of real journalism that the facts drive the story not the other way around.  We wouldn’t find this acceptable behavior in any other profession (law, engineering, policing) so why make an exception for journos. Just because it’s convenient to a current position?
---
"I agree with your stance against the media" yeah man democracy sucks ass, why would we ever need to hold people in power to account
---
George, is that you?
---
Actually there's rumors about Early-Mid February for Wastelanders Update
---
Lol the topic is about fallout 76. Ita always an appropriate time to trash this. Just really surprised people actually still play it.
---
Well, it's a tenet of journalism that's based on facts, which drive the narrative. But like, even if you play and enjoy Fallout 76, are you saying there aren't a series of facts over time that support the narrative that it was very buggy at launch and continues to suffer major issues of playability? 
---
Like, there are other narrative choices to make with what we have now, but the easy and obvious one is pretty well-supported.
---
The inventory hack is fixed?
---
Which wouldn't be **so** much of a problem... except the daily/weekly "exclusive" sales. Miss it and you can't buy it for another 6 months.
---
So that is a responds stating you have not actual rational for your statement.
---
Than u either dont play very long or run every condition perk u can  they even made it worse and nerfed white knight a while back only gear i have that lasts along time is my robot gear for some reason
---
Agreed. Normal during the day, and stronger during the night.
---
We treat noobs great. A majority of us will give you stuff to help you get going. Pvp is totally avoidable. Add me and I can help you get going worthless1509
---
It's a triple A game from a new studio under bethesda's banner who had never made a game before and originally were making a hero shooter that was in dev hell.
---
The player base for 76 in general is very good. No one can hurt you unless you shoot them back. The only exception to that rule is if you claim a workshop. I personally haven’t dealt with a DC in a few months with decent internet.
---
It's legit, all of those outfits always drop in a single bundle with a 0.15% chance (1 in 666) from events in Savage Divide.
---
People keep mistaking Bethesda Austin as Bethesda Maryland.  
---
Bethesda Maryland are the people who made skyrim, fallout 4, fallout 3, morrowind, arena, daggerfall, oblivion,   and more, whereas BGS Austin is the dev for 76 (They were originally making Battlecry as Battlecry Studios but it went into dev hell)
---
working 50+ hours a week and having family makes you be a little pickier on the games you spend money on due to limited time to enjoy all of them.
---
The servers are hit or miss. It seems a bit more stable for me recently. Private servers help, but you have to subscribe to 1st for them
---
This is one of the most caring communities when it comes to newbies. No one will ever look down on you. They will want to help by either giving you supplies or giving you information to point you in the right direction.
---
I think a lot of people forget that fire range on turrents is a sphere... place them too high up and you are shortening their range, not lengthening it. 
---
defenses are best placed on the stairs + platform object. two turrets per, with overlapping fields of fire. 
---
my base is near lower level spawn points (level 1-5 mobs for the most part) and the most have ever had was light wall damage and 1-3 crops destroyed. I only use 2 rocket launchers about 1.5 floors above ground level, and 7 turrets at 1 floor above ground with the last one at ground pointing into my main base stairway in case something rushes through. 
---
floating bases for the win.
---
Yeah, not sure on who's name though.
---
Nothing is ever removed from the game after events. You can keep the gifts and open them later and still get the rewards.
---
76 didn't break. There was a very assholic hacker who developed code under the guise of being a fix for a issue that was further developed into a hack, and the hackers for this and the last hack LOVED the attention, in fact several of them WENT to news sites to get this to blow up for the fame.
---
Well...  
---
If it weren't for kotaku, we wouldn't have known of the bioware developmental state around Anthem.
---
What do you consider to be good rewards?
---
I just scrapped a bunch and unlocked the ultracite mods 👌But I’m not sure what the last Radium mod is, it wouldn’t tell me what’s missing but I guess it’s a scope or sight? The Powerful Auto and suppressor were actually not among the last few.
---
How do you do QA on code that was purposely created to be a hack?  
---
Bethesda did not create the code that allowed for this hack, the hackers did.
---
I can't understand. If you want me to reply fix your grammar
---
Juicehead also mentioned lawsuits for players losing items in a digital game.
---
You are not alone brother
---
considering all NPC factions are currently dead, um, we are all freaking presidents.
---
I don’t get your goal here? Are you trying to get me in a technicality or something? 
---
I said in my first post the game throughout its life has been a “shit show”.  My point is, people (writers) that feel the need to be hyperbolic and untruthful with facts to support a narrative are at best putting out a bad product, and at worst opportunistic liars.  It’s almost definitely just the first but that’s not a good bracket to be in. 
---
There’s no need to be hyperbolic when the actual evidence can make the same argument just maybe not as clickbaity as you want it to be.
---
The Enclave is like Walmart, they'll hire anyone with a heart beat.
---
I cannot recall a time that we have been as bad off as we are right now in a year of play personally. There have been some bad times but this takes the cake.
---
Yes, the performance is still unstable and Bethesda keep fixing it in every patch, but not all PCs are built the same which makes this hard.  
---
The buggyness is due to this being a wholly new studio who was bought out by Bethesda Maryland and given a game that was only a concept created by Bethesda Maryland.  
---
As for hackers, every damn game from GTA Online to CSGO has had and will have malicious hackers no matter what you do, you just gonna patch what you can and make the hack weak while the hacker moves to another style of code.  
---
As for the hack, it was not bethesda's fault that the hack exists. The hack was originally a way to steal strangler armor under the guise of being a fix for it that another person made into a very malicious piece of code that they injected into the game itself (Which could be seen itself as illegal) that stole all that was in a player';s inventory.  
---
New code will and always will get made for malicious intent, and props to bethesda for responding so fast despite the fact that it was nearly christmas and the team was surely going on break.
---
The problem with the travel mat is that people could use them to be dicks and make you appear in a locked room full of rad emitters and spike traps and flame throwers oh my
---
99% of the time private servers are lag free. i can definitely tell because i gather water almost every time i login to do basic food/drink crafting and find that i switch to private just to do it faster than pub servers.
---
I agree.  When the game first started, a scorch beast would stop by every day and destroy my crops, so I planted indoors with crops planted on campfires.  I thought they would leave that glitch functional while they worked on planters FO4 style.   It really ticked me off when they patched the glitch but still no planters to replace them.  I've been waiting to be able to move my camp without losing my crops.  I never heard about a rug being able to do the same thing.   When players visit my camp they see the campfires with crops and start flashing question marks at me.
---
It'll come with Wastelanders as rumored and thusly announced by Bethesda.
---
Days can vary when I play from a couple of hours to 5+ depending on factors.  I do run every condition perk and I have the two luck perks for armor and weapons to be repaired at 2 stars.  It is amazing how useful the perks can be when you don't focus completely on DPS.
---
I have heard that you might want to craft all homemade ones before the 31st, but I think the gifts themselves stay forever.
---
I will take that as a confirmation. And with that I will laugh at how sad your life must be that you hang around a sub reddit for a game you do not like just to randomly shit on it. And then pretend like you actually accomplished anything.
---
Juicehead at least even doubted that the hacker was being truthful since having to count 500 people is insane dedication.
---
You saying they could have stripped naked and cried wolf?
---
I habeeb it.
---
Lol my life is sad?! I'm not the one playing this shit game.
---
Ah! Thank you so much
---
There's one that spawns at that lookout north of the whitesprings. Cant think of the name, starts with an M I believe, something lookout. Yao huh spawns every time.
---
whats the best non-gimmick weapon setup? IE just items and perks only, not chem/health level dependent stuff?
---
Name one good media outlet that has no leaning, perfect citation, and full credibility. There isn’t one. All have taken a knee to reflect actual interests of their publication. Construction has not. Medical fields have not. Both of those are core industries. They don’t compare.
---
After looking at your user flair I'd say they adapt to their playerbase quite nicely :D
---
In GTAV there was a hack that let you kill people in single player.
---
Seriously asking, why do you keep playing and defending this game?
---
It is crearly not consumer friendly and rewarding such behavior just make bethesda care less.
---
This ain't not gta online or red dead online if that's what you're implying.
---
Doesn’t matter as they aren’t collecting gifts anymore , bugthesda seemed to have ended the event even tho they said it would end I believe the 31 st
---
This was certainly bad, but having your stuff eaten by the Vault raid and support being all like "Too bad so sad" wasn't a walk in the park either.
---
Yuh, there is a difference saying "Pistols no longer function in game because of a bug" and "One specific pistol stopped working for a few days until they fixed it." But an even bigger difference when they report "ALL PISTOLS DON'T WORK FALLOUT 76 IS TRASH DON'T PLAY IT!" 
---
You can't say the first or third are valid because it helps Bethesda realise there are things to fix, or that it rallies the community....it's just bad journalism.
---
They fixed it several hours ago
---
Im on PC so itd take less than 10 minutes to download anyways...is that your main problem with the game?  Download time?
---
The first time i heard of kotaku was about this game, and it was the bit that put me right off of them, it was when this game was leaked and described as a "rust clone" which is what sparked off the hate train against this game and got so many people, includluding fallout fans, to never actually buy and try the game, but instead to turn on bethesda and spread hate at any opportunity
---
i have a level 10 that launched a nuke.   i’m working on getting a level 15 to solo the silo and solo the queen!
---
Look if the media reports that your dumpster caught on fire and got carried away in a flood when in reality it only caught on fire that doesn't change the fact that you still have a dumpster fire on your hands. and no one gives a crap about how it's being classified "unfairly". Our bigger question is why do you keep giving the bum more booze and matches to light dumpster fires with in the first place.
---
I personally believe its the most egregious pay to win component to a game i have seen in a long time. I subscribe because its literally stupid to play this game without it. thats how stupid OP it is. 
---
between 1st and the repair kits i purchase with the points, i went from struggling to keep my armor repaired each day and barely getting anything done to massively farming the living hell out of legendaries with this scorched event so much so that me and a friend both had to start mule characters to hold them all while we wait for the daily reset of the 150 script. 
---
we come out of glass cavern at over 1200 weight of crap every run and generally 5-10 legionaries. and thats not even counting the presents themselves that i havent bothered to open yet. this event is hugely over delivering, and its only possible because we can loot whatever the hell we want and scrap it all and put it into our infinite scrap storage thats right outside the exit, then teleport to the merchants and sell off what we can before they run out of caps/scripts and store the rest on alts. 
---
all on a private, lag free server, with no competition or grief or exploits.
---
No, but some people don't like re downloading 50gb+ as not every place has fiber optics yet.
---
lol that's what Wastelanders is gonna be supposedly, a huge fat download of new locations, actually joinable factions, and several human NPCs with working conversation dialogue. That's not gonna be a small update to do all of those things mins you. Not hyping it up, just expect it to be a fat download
---
Ho Ho Ho santa is back
---
thank you
---
I believe they had the fast travel mat in there for a few, but people were using it to do shit and they got rid of it. You can however still get one for workshops.
---
Ohhh nice didn’t know that , thought they’d did it like the Halloween Events
---
Makes sense
---
I agree. As much as bad journalism rustles my jimmies, Bethesda just keeps giving them new material for clickbait, they don't even seem to try to manage their own public image anymore.
---
It's usually tied to a higher level player being in the area and them spawning leveled for them
---
Depends. I've always wanted to support 76. Bethesda took a risk and I commend them for that.
---
I support the game. Despite all the shit that its put me through-bugs, crashing, various glitches... I found the game pretty refreshing especially playing with a friend. 
---
Would definently support a overhaul of the game. If Bethesda took the game down for a few weeks to iron out the bugs, test them and renew the game, it would be good for them.
---
But to do this is VERY unorthodox. Like a car with defective factory parts, Bethesd should fix the problems. It's the least they could do to start gaining decent PR.
---
lol you're late with the news, either that wasn't happening and was just a rumor being spread, or they fixed it before I logged on around 4:20 my time
---
Bro, millions of people is not at all realistic about the numbers.
---
It was happening as I was trying to farm them before that time and others as well were posting
---
Grinches be grinchin'
---
the original is reported to be but there are rumors of a workaround. Something about using trading instead of transfering to buy an inventory for a cap if other redditors are to be believed.
---
Oh hell, you are laughably naive if you think the construction field and medicine are completely free from political influence, issues with sources/citations and being credible.
---
I'm playing a game that I enjoy and will continue to play until I no longer enjoy it. You are haunting a sub reddit making bullshit posts while patting yourself on the back.
---
Its gotten to the point where you have Yongyea click baiting and spreading misinformation about the game... its sad.
---
Also with Fallout 1st, so many videos and articles going "YOU NEED TO PAY $100 FOR PRIVATE SERVERS 11!11!" - like not really? Its a sub fee that also comes with more than just that, have you never played an MMO game? Some don't even let you access without paying box price + sub fee. They're acting as if this is the first time ever a game has asked for an optional subscription.
---
Usually it means you should take a break from the main quest and level up before proceeding
---
Tim Rogers is such a funny guy, I can sit and watch him ramble for hours, he just has such a unique personality.
---
As Enclave its fun to play with a community.
---
That's a good analogy :D But as in real life, you can go into rehab metaphorically by not using fo1st for a while. I cancelled mine after first month and when I returned to the game after couple week break I found out I don't really need it anymore. I'm set for life material-wise (and I didn't even grind for mats, just played the game during that month) and the tent is not that much needed anyway.
---
Maybe they'll add some new features that'll change my mind but for now it's not really worth it to renew the sub past the first month.
---
I'll keep that in mind thank you
---
That could have been the issue now that I think about it, thank you!
---
Lol you call this haunting? Holy shit your soft. I hope you didn't pay for that overpriced subscription shit either. That would be real sad.
---
12 dollars? You over paid, friend. :)
---
Friend got a free copy when he bought a new xbox controller, lol.
---
I cant spare the points for those and im not dps i need pretty much every weight reduction perk just to play
---
That was an extremely isolated incident though, not really a persistent and ongoing threat. Still sucks but it wasn't exactly an intentional issue, so I put it lower on my personal scale. Something akin to when people were losing power armor early on. 
---
Hackers have been actively messing with the game for months now however, their latest act by far the worse. That to me is much worse, and it appears to just be escalating.
---
On one hand, what you say is correct.
---
On the other, outsourcing a product (not exactly the case here, but pretty close) doesn't mean it gets a free pass if it's bad, It was still the consequence of a choice made by the company.
---
Not sure if this is a ninja edit or some non /s sarcasm.  
---
Supporting someone lies to fit a narrative is not great, please don't justify it with whataboutisms.
---
You’re probably in the savage divide when you should still be hanging around in the forest, ash heap, and toxic valley. Level up a little and quest in those areas before you head on to new ones.
---
They spent as much on all the past games, and they have all been as bad. That was all I was getting at. I think you got me wrong, I am not defending Bethesda, I am attacking the gaming community's reaction to their failures.
---
 Bethesda is never going to do something like that the damage has been done and the word has spread that this game has problems. However many people are playing this game is whats left of the fallout community, its never going to grow any bigger, but i hope wastelanders is a breath of fresh air for those who played from day one!
---
I just hope so and it's not just a 20gb update. I wanna see them redo the whole game entirely so the current build of the game were playing now with all the bugs it has is just straight up gone and the graphical bugs are gone too.
---
&gt; My biggest problem is that issues with **FO4** exist. But the hyperbole around this the game, because it isn't their Goldilocks of the Fallout series, is just ridiculous sometimes.
---
&gt; **FO76 on the other hand is itself ridiculous this community has standards people**
---
 FTFY
---
This is a pretty common thing. Rockstar does the same thing when you buy a shark card. Money comes out, gta$ goes within 48 hours.
---
At this point, the controversies and butt jokes of this game is providing more entertainment than the actual game.
---
Right there with you, Red. Thanks for all you do with PKOA. I'm glad to be a part of it. Christmas really sucked for me this year, but at least I was able to play with you guys. And don't forget, you ain't alone, my friend.
---
I mean it *is* a Bethesda game, man. To this day FO3, NV, and FO4 are buggy pieces of shit if you don't install some unofficial patches on PC
---
I'm just hoping Bethesda is gonna surprise us with a redone game like what the devs did to Ff14. Only difference is Bethesda kept the servers live so we could keep playing and catching bugs so they can fix it in wastelanders.
---
...what?
---
I'm asking if people in the same cell can still clean out my inventory or not. I don't trade with people anyway, I don't care if people are getting screwed that way.
---
Yeah I used an EMEA key last night, set my location to Austria to use the key and turned off my VPN to play and it works fine
---
Well, no. Because I'm opening up the conversation that it is unacceptable. Everything isn't so black and white in the world with me. If something is unacceptable and I start to notice it, I open a conversation. If middle ground can't reached then action. It's more fulfilling this way.
---
Awesome, great to know, thank you. There's no possible ban chance right?
---
Dude just get over it, it’s patched!
---
They have "kinda" kept support for fallout 4 and skyrim. Like they got 4k updates and stuff. Its kind of understandable of how well the game runs if they patched the previous game and copied what they did there to here.
---
No problem and I highly doubt it
---
Your calling out a player online for playing the game? Thats just part of it man. This post is pretty ridiculous honestly
---
Got the same drop from one violent night. Accidentally scrapped the forest mask at the power armor station behind the warehouse before i realized i recieved all of those.
---
I won’t come back until my stash is unlimited.
---
So you support false advertising and broken promises? I can play this game too. It's ok to lie to you AND charge you money for something broken, then break it again over and over. But if one article didn't check their facts right up until print, once, that's just a bridge too far for you.
---
It is a small amount of players.  Less then 1000 and it seems to be less then 500.  They have reached out to compensate and will have the numbers to what is a very small % of the playerbase who were hacked.
---
You QA your own code to make sure it won't get toyed around like it were open source.
---
No cuz there useless deathtraps ill take the free kill
---
Yeahhhh I think they're much closer than you think
---
Traveling Pharmacy 3 star and feather armor 2 star.  I think I cycle between junk perk and strong back 1 star depending on what I'm doing.  Oh and bandoiler 3 star as well.
---
The internet did nothing more than wisely advice innocent people not to waste their money on this dumpster fire. You can't get mad at other people just for having standards.
---
... you do relize thats your fault right? You plenty of time to stash that or use it.
---
Given the way these hacks work it'd probably still by remote just leveraging a different system of the game
---
Stash full of legendaries and vendor stuff no pay to win here and scrap ox behind paywalls. I fail to see how a blue screen buggy game over a year after release is my fault
---
Hmph, this should be a wake up call to the masochists that still play this garbage fire. Bethesda either has no idea how many people got hacked, or is trying to downplay the issue in some pathetic attempt to save what's left of their disfigured face. Either way you are most likely not going to get back any of your lost stuff. BETHESDA DOES NOT, NOR HAS IT EVER CARED ABOUT YOU. I will be abandoning this game and I will **never** come back. 
---
I'd advise the rest of you to do the same. Goodbye bugthesda
---
If its unacceptable then there is no middle ground.  Its unacceptable.  Period. You've already come to your conclusion.
---
Except, of course, now you're looking for reasons to back off from it.
---
If its unacceptable - take your business elsewhere.
---
This should be against the rules to post he didn’t do anything wrong
---
Ok, so basically a completed character  can do nothing as a leader anymore, but benefit as a member for himself, if he repeats quests, which are from others.
---
So the fun with these is indeed finite...
---
&gt;I am not sure how you got the impression Bethesda could pull off a non-buggy AAA release but that mistake is on you.
---
I love how you call valid criticism "hysterics", then admit that anything but a giant cluster fuck was inevitable. As if that's somehow acceptable and not worthy of criticism. Like one can't be criticized if you just fuck up all the time.
---
lmfao dude said he still enjoys the game thats the most inane shit
---
Yeah it's out fault for paying money for a product and expecting it to work. Do you even listen to yourself? Holy shit, what is wrong with you?
---
Lol
---
Because its up to you to control your stash. I dont have 1st. So i can tell you for a fact that as much of a pain in the ass it is you couldave stored your shit.
---
You do not play the game. You do not like the game. And yet you search though the sub reddit replying to dozens of posts just to complain about the game.  
---
That is the definition of haunting.
---
its sad ur actually getting downvoted on a game thats hasnt been fixed in over a year
---
I've said it before and I'll say it again - Games 'Journalists' won't give your game positive press unless you pay them for it - Bethesda clearly isn't paying the required *bribe* money the hitpiece writers want.
---
Where was your intense desire for the truth after Bethesda lied multiple times about this game? Why do you suddenly hold people accountable now? Or are your principles limited to people who have something negative to say about something you enjoy?
---
This one seems like it's on you. Should manage your inventory better..  plenty of stash boxes and workbenches around the world.
---
honestly ur better playing something else if you care about ur stuff not being stolen
---
Thanks, good to know!
---
It's unbelievable isn't it?  
---
One article sets a fire under their asses, but not being lied to and sold a broken mess for upwards of a hundred bucks. Bethesda can lie through their teeth, AND charge money and these dopes will not only buy it, but pretend it's not a problem, and actively attack anyone who knows better.
---
Bethesda should've stayed in their fucking lane and never attempted multiplayer.
---
Negative I have recovered my flux many times already today
---
Falling out of the tree
---
Stable flux?
---
Yes
---
The game is fine, or at least was when I still played.
---
Why are you here if you hate it so much?
---
Honestly you're just making excuses for the company's mistakes.
---
If performance issues were only due to hardware differences, it wouldn't run like shit on ps4 (and believe me it does). 
---
If the game is buggy due to it being made by a new studio, that was still bethesda's fully aware choice.
---
Gta Online and csgo have hacking problems, yet they do not get the same flack because gtav at least comes with a good offline game and csgo bans thousands of hackers every month, patches security flaws and even updates the game's graphics 8 years after launch.
---
Hackers breaking 76 to the point of fucking looting other live players was only possible due to how poorly written the code was. Yeah hackers are scum, but you don't leave your froont door open all day counting on people's best behavior.
---
Lastly, bethesda's response to the latest hack was the complete opposite of fast, they were not only told beforehand of the hack, they were also told how it was done, and it still took them a fucking week to do anything.
---
The only thing that's more disappointing than fo76, is people going such a long way to stand up for a brand.

Steam reviews for FO,NV: "Worst Fallout Game"  
---
Don't even get me started on Tactics reviews.
---
Your shifting standard of “bullshit” is pretty wild given you’re still playing this game.
---
No. No. (Invested 500k in wrapping paper)
---
Because youre blaming someone else for your problems instead of taking responsobility for your actions
---
My actions didn’t cause a blue screen. . .
---
Bro WHY DOES GAME JOURNALİSTS DONT TAKE MY VİDO GAME SERİOUSLY bro cringe
---
So pedantic.
---
If you're on XBOX or PS4, yes, it's still active on PC.
---
Yes as in they will be removed?
---
I'm here because I keep looking for a sign that this game is worth coming back to, yet all I see are people either jumping ship or claiming it still floats while ignoring the water on their knees.
---
You don’t get to be self righteous, you didn’t program the game either. Blaming me for code someone else wrote and passed off as a finished product is tantamount to ridiculousness.
---
Once upon a time I was one of the first and worst abusers of 'bloggers who think they're doing important journalism.'
---
I was an idiot, and so are they.
---
I uninstall/reinstall this game on a weekly basis anyway, so, sure lol
---
Except you just explained exactly why it's bullshit, one person swearing they still got hit after the patch isn't proof of anything.  If the hack were still active this place would be burning to the fucking ground by now.  Know how easy it would even be to fake getting hacked after the patch?  Take off all your armor and just have an outfit on, go somewhere with witnesses, take off your outfit so you're naked, "OMG SOMEONE HACKED ME".
---
A few suggestions.  
---
Bulk and sell your scrap; you don't need much of anything if you don't make ammo or build repeatedly.  
---
Sell or drop all the ammo you don't use.  2 full fusion cores are all I need in the rare case I pull out the PA.  No reason to have mini nukes or missles unless you actively use those weapons.  
---
Turn that flux into serums.  Get one recipe for each kind of flux and  your stash box will thank you. 
---
Scrip those legendaries.  Unless it's something market worthy either sell it cheap or scrip it.  
---
Make a mule character.  Find a friend to help you move items to store.
---
I dunno about the bluescreen issues, but carrying around 300 pounds of junk seems avoidable. 
---
Make a 2nd character, find a friend to help you move stuff around.
---
A republican and a fo76 fan wow it all makes sense now
---
I think it can, but idk how many people will be around to see the shortcomings dye off. People rarely come back to a game they were burned by. Too many games, too little time.
---
Yeah i'll give you that, the vault experiments are always a good story.
---
Yes it would take a huge leap because that isn't how logic fucking works.  It would take me five seconds to walk up to someone right now and kick them in the nuts.  Logically speaking does that mean I could kick over 17000 people in the nuts in a single day?  It takes time, effort, things are going to get in my way, I won't be able to find people and so on and so on and so on.  Even the most degenerate hacker is going to get bored of shit like this after the first few dozen people.
---
This may sound just obvious, but just ignore them. They will soon see that they are getting no attention from you, so they will go search for someone else to bother. He keeps at it cause he is getting an reaction from you.
---
Are you suggesting it’s ok for people to write completely false media articles? If you are going to be objective it, you should at least be objective of everything. There are clearly issues with this game, but that does not mean we should not call out journalists for being full of shit. Call them both out, fair is fair.
---
Which is why smart people cite the sources that Wikipedia articles cite.
---
Those are all good suggestions, alas all I do is make massive amounts of ammo. It’s what drives the game.im talking 200k of ultracite at time. I always cap out and script out first thing when I get on but because of this Christmas event
---
I’m much more loaded than usual. Just seems like after a year we could have the product we all paid for and we’re ensured we’d get.
---
You must be one of the very few.
---
I’m sorry this has happened to you. This sounds like an individual that I came across a few months ago. I blocked him. Have you reported him to Microsoft yet? 
---
I think I seen you play a few times in NW. I always seen your name pop up. That’s a shame that people come to this point to do this.
---
A broken clock is right twice a day.
---
Don't use turrets man, not enough crap attacks anyways, and what does, you can kill or the people who spawn it in when they come to your camp can kill... i can count on one hand how many times i didn't notice, and some walls got destroyed...   
---
DON'T USE THEM. The only reason i can see for using them, is if you have a forward operating base like camp, using it to farm a deathclaw spawn or some crap, and to that i say... WHY!? You don't need a resource node, you don't need turrets, they eat your budget up and it's too small even without those things.   
---
Kick ass house&gt; a turret and some lead every 2 hours.
---
We need a fair and balanced view of the game, someone who both plays and listens to feedback so they can accurately feel the pulse of the game and disseminate it to their readers. Right now we have the equivalent of the worst CNN and FOX and friends have being slung in out faces.
---
All turrets have a chance to bug and become hostile towards player built objects OR the player... don't use turrets lol, unless in a workshop, even then you're going to have to tear em' down and build em' back up!
---
Loud, annoying, obstructive and WEAK AF anyways. Shotgun turrets and lvl 2 machineguns are the best.
---
I can't really think of many situations that warrant long range effectiveness for a CAMP defense... most times they pop right in front of whoever FT to your CAMP to begin with. I say they're worthless 9/10 times. Fight me!
---
Oh what's your source?
---
take my downvote bud.
---
Yeah, my 2nd character is stuck at Pleasant Valley Station awaiting the scrip refresh, and will probably be there for a few days.  I have my weapon mule super overweight at the legendary station rolling for level 5 weapon weight reduction armor.  We're all overloaded.  If you have a way to make a mule character, I strongly suggest it.
---
That's also not true.
---
Yes, but even those few articles woefully pale in comparison to the creative, intricate, first-rate reporting that Pulitzer Prize-nominated Buzzfeed News does. I’m not bashing games journalism — it is just as valid as any other subject, and it can/has be done in a way that rivals those subjects too — but Buzzfeed News covers a lot more than that:
---
Currently, Buzzfeed News’ front page has an article from their reporter abroad in New Delhi, who reports that India’s Hindu Nationalist Government has been shutting off internet across the country as Indian citizens turn to the service to protest a new anti-Muslim citizenship Law. Next to it is a report from their Reynosa, Mexico reporter, who has uncovered new information that shows US border agents are sending asylum-seekers back to Mexico without their children that they showed up with. As I said in another comment, they leaked the Trump-Russia dossier that most other news sites/outlets wouldn’t even touch. They broke the story about Kevin Spacey and his sexual assault of a minor at a party. There’s a reason Buzzfeed News was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize in both 2017 and 2018.
---
To me, this is much more important reporting than Kotaku writing about a failed game. I’m not saying that the game is unimportant, but there is a clear difference in scope between the two sites. Sure, maybe I gave Kotaku an unfair deal putting them with other blog sites, but I still think they sit far below Buzzfeed News and other international news reporting outlets.
---
Doesn’t gta5 run clientside as well? Stopped playing that game when some douche took all my shit. Seriously, most of the games i stop playing is because cheaters are ruining it. But i think GTA5 still has a big userbase so don’t know about the todays cheating status ...
---
What an intellectually lazy strawman.
---
&gt; I don’t even play the game anymore, I just think a lot of media outlets and you tubers are very obviously stretching the truth
---
If you aren't playing, how do know?
---
He hasn't gotten a reaction out of me until today, just couldn't believe someone would make a comment like he did. I'm hoping to spread awareness to Bethesda of the lowlifes on their servers
---
Yes reported and blocked his main and the account he made mocking me.
---
Move your camp box in the Edit Menu around your camp, it’ll change your general spawn point location! it helps a lot!
---
Jason Schreier of Kotaku is one of the few real journalists in games media, he broke the story on the sexist work culture at riot / the trouble behind destiny's development / the trouble behind anthem's development / the recent issues of crunch at rockstar in prep for rdr2 and that's just the notable few that i could remember without any effort...almost every big story that kotaku broke were done by him...
---
I'd love for someone to point out another journalist whom has more original news to share
---
...other similarly skilled journalists are Paul Tassi of Forbes, Jim Sterling (even if he grand stands too much and is the "blogger-i-est" of these named), Geoff Keely (old guard), and Greg Miller (newer geoff basically)
---
You're damn right. 
---
Ethically speaking that's the best option. 
---
Kill 1,000 people and save millions or let millions die because you wouldn't kill 1,000 people. 
---
Ethically speaking if you could save a large enough percentage of the population you should always save the population.
---
Imagine if there were 1,000 people with a deadly and highly contagious virus would you let them run around spreading it or quarantine them to save the rest of the population?
---
In this case Bethesda isn't ignoring those affected they're actually trying to help and they do have a couple million total players but active players aren't nearly in the millions more like in the hundreds of thousands. Because active players means those that will play the game for a few hours each month. Player retention is a problem with any Bethesda game due to having a highly limited supply of content. Whereas most other mmorpgs have a steady flow of evolving content that pushes the grind even higher.
---
I would, though I highly doubt they will do a full revamp, unless its somehow very profitable for their bottom line. 
---
The game itself to me a paradox; it goes against what Bethesda is known for, which is releasing games that have potential (but are very buggy) and relying on the community at large to bring polish / fixes. In the case of Fallout 76 its a live service, so Bethesda is at the helm of both maintenance and content creation. However the game still relies on the community to bring the game to life (albeit with a limited tool set). In addition, since they had heavily relied upon the community to make bug fixes (namely through modded patches) I feel their technical competency in this area is still inadequate.  
---
My guess is that much of Wastelanders will rely on the instancing technology currently employed for raids and private servers, so the overall experience won't differ too much from what we have now. In the 12/18 ITV they mention the Wayward encampment as being a  "new instanced location"
---
really, spreading false news is ok with you?. if you are being objective with 76’s shortcomings then why not be objective of false journalism?
---
So you say its super common and can only find 2 examples... Of which the first is actually not even that bad, since publication dates and write dates are not the same, especially with you count a less than 48h windows between publication and hotfix, which seems more bad timing than bad intent.
---
The 500 in one night was the claim of the guy in the video, which actually showed in about 12min that he stole the inventory of 78 people. Now if he can steal stuff from 78 people in a 12min thats sped up, he can easily steal 500 and a shitload more in a few hours, so the point that the video directly shows 500 incidents might be not correct, but then product of the information definitely is.... thats also what the reddit comments were about, not that it shows 500 thefts, but that atleast 500 peoples stuff got stolen in a few hours which was proven by that video.
---
Seems like you have more a problem with negative or criticising exposés about 76 than actual, reporting.
---
I just edited a wikipedia article about the german picture rights law (or whatever the translation is in english) because people wrote bullshit in there. I quoted sources and linked to other information, but i didnt have to do any validation, if i wanted to i could have fucked it up and not care at all, thats how secure wikipedia information is.
---
One of the scout challenges requires crafting three plasma grenades. Prior to this event the plans for them we’re super rare. 
---
Regarding your question on whether some of us craft grenades—yes. Yes we do. But nuka grenades is the way I go. 
---
My absolute favorite way to kill something is to throw a grenade near the target(s) and the shoot the grenade using VATS. It’s sooo satisfying. It’s such a big kaboom.
---
This perspective is part of the problem IMO. Bethesda and games journalism aren't my enemies or my friends, they are two corporate entities competing for my attention. And I consider willfully or neglectfully inaccurate information being disseminated by media to be just as lazy and abusive as Bethesda QA slip-ups. They just don't get called on it anywhere near as often as Bethesda does.
---
Simply put, I will continue to criticize this game (ideally in as productive a way as possible), but my honest and analytical criticism of this game is undermined by the emotions and ideology that tribalism and self-indulgence are creating in gamer culture, and by the sensationalism that goes on in games media.
---
Ignore him, why are u getting so bent out of shape about this?  Also, get your kid off your profile don’t put personal info out there like that - this is the internet u gots to be careful.
---
yes but the OP is not defending Bethesda’s actions, it is fighting against false journalism. since when should lies be allowed just because they fit your narrative? if its ok to be objective about 76’s faults then it’s ok to be objective about lies and exaggerations from journalists. Call them both out.
---
You don't have to interact with anyone you dont want to online. Just block him and don't respond to any smurf accounts.
---
Yeah I have been in the Savage Divide a lot, so that does make sense. Thanks
---
What sources would you recommend they use?
---
How about playing the game firsthand? Well it would be a crapshoot if you actually encounter the hack and even then all you'll get is footage that can already be sourced on youtube and, well reddit. Attempting to recreate the bug would lead to an inevitable ban and that's assuming the Servers aren't down because of the hack.
---
Okay so there's no point playing the game to get information. How about getting info straight from the horses mouth? Yeah, what about content updates from Bethesda? Oh those are posted on reddit aren't they. Well there's always the Bethesda.net forums... which are completely dead. Not dead as in "barely anyone around" but dead as in "the only posts are patch notes" and even then they are used as a reference in the Polygon article you linked.
---
I'm pretty sure a lot of games journalists would be using different sources if there were any of note.
---
I opened 1000 Large Handcrafted gifts and only got like 38 of them so I think they are pretty rare.
---
If you're daring enough you try collecting some fusion cores and hunt down a set of level 15 Raider PA pieces. Those could potentially help you in higher level areas / enemies. Depending on their numbers you could bum rush with melee to quickly take them down, or try kiting and corralling to mass kill with grenades. As you level up and reach the appropriate breakpoints you could "hermit crab" into higher level power armor.
---
Learn how to ‘highlight’ junk that you need like lead, makes it easy to find stuff you need for crafting, remember to scrap junk and bulk the junk in order to save on your weight limits. It gets pretty grindy at times if you are soloing the game but anytime I got put into places I was out gunned I just hit a good farming route and collected lead and legendary gear until was was lvled up enough to carry on. Have fun
---
I may do so thank you
---
There is plenty of valid criticism, and there is also hysterics. My criticism is that the media and the community went far beyond what was necessary when throwing hatred around. How is this so hard to see? The game got brigaded by communities who wanted nothing more than to see it fail, that isn't criticism it's just plain old hatred. This whole business about the exploit was by people who simply wanted to ruin the game because they think Bethesda deserves it.
---
You made a typo. 
---
"a few players" -&gt; "quite a few players"
---
Your welcome.
---
What’s the badhistrory ‘tween Kotaku &amp; Bethesda?
---
Beta day one PS4 player here. Most of the "griefers" have moved on to other games. You get shitheads here and there but nowhere as rampant as it used to be. As mentioned, workshops are the exception but that's just gameplay, not griefing (especially since they got rid of Survival mode, taking Poseidon or Ammo Factory workshops is considered a sign to the server that you wanna PvP). Fights can sometimes break out around Whitespring/after endgame Scorchbeast Queen fights -- if PvP isn't your style, just keep Pacifist mode on and don't ever shoot back. 
---
Back in the day you could harass players pretty easily and destroy their base without provocation but those days are gone. No PvPer worth a shit will harass low levels. I love a good fight but with someone on my level. I regularly find low levels on the server to gift plans/gear to and most high levels I know are the same. So if you see an overgeared 300+ coming straight for you don't run, we're just trying to give you stuff to help you out.
---
Servers seem pretty active. Most of my friends have moved on to other games but there's still a really healthy number of oldies like us running around. 
---
As for disconnects... I get a blue screen maybe once a session if I'm at it for a few hours but overall I'd say the game is a whole helluva lot more stable than it used to be.
---
Wrong. The weight limit is your normal carry weight + 1500. A full set of weapon weight reduction gear can turn 2000 weight into 250 easily.
---
&gt;drops the n bomb
---
I'll never understand this. it's just a word. I probably use it several times a day.
---
Yes a picture of my kid on my Xbox profile is something I need to be worried about. Someone might come and kidnap him if I beat them in a game
---
How classy of you
---
Don't worry about friends, they're not worth your time. Listen to your radio. Friends are temporary, but Butcher Pete is forever.
---
I have the same processor and amount of RAM and usually get around 60fps at 1080p with an RX 570 Pulse. It sometimes dips into the high 40s if there's a lot going on.
---
I don't hang around [insert pejorative term here] so I guess my skin isn't as thin skinned if I spent all day circlejerking on twitter about how progressive I am.
---
You just activated my trap card
---
Literally no one could care less about whatever you're trying to turn the conversation into
---
I mean, I could say the same about this thread, that's my point.
---
it's a waste of time through and through.
---
Yet you commented
---
What happens if we were older, and didn't have to wait so long? Wouldn't it be nice to live together, in the kind of world where we belong?
---
yet you created this thread
---
again, that's my point. getting offended over a word.
---
Man, you got some real idiots commenting on this thread don't you?
---
That's the hardest weapon ( Radium rifle ) to unlock. Anyone who can do that is a legend.
---
38 is  much, must be about 200 plans in the pool, I think only get 3, and I spend lot caps and time farming
---
Might not be a popular opinion, but I kinda hope they dont increase drop rate of rare. Add new items, sure, but if everything drops quickly and abundantly than it really takes the fun out of getting something exciting or working hard for something and finally getting it. See forrest jump suit vs mechanic jumpsuit. I still havent completed 100% of clothing, and that's okay, because I get to keep coming back to try. If one day I log in and poof, I suddenly have everything, I'd be kinda sad.
---
How does me joining a session and being spawned inside a cage with 20 clones of myself attacking me while I am on fire constitute working? The exploits in GTAV get big points for creativity that's for sure.  
---
We obviously disagree on the intensity if the failings here. But I have a genuine question, why do you come to this subreddit? This place is bombarded with negative comments in almost every thread, and I just don't understand why people who hate the game so much stick around. Do you find the game fun when it's working?
---
Real intelligent individuals I see lol. I love how people always go to "it's just a word" 9/10 times those people are racist as fuck and that's their go to excuse. It's almost fucking 2020 there is no excuse or reason for behavior like that but they will always have one 😭 tragic
---
&gt;They leaked the Trump-Russia dossier that most news sites refused to publish.
---
Because it was a made up piece of trash written from whole cloth and paid for by the DNC. I'm not a Trump supporter but I do try to look at all sides of a given point. The facts on the dossier are clear and even the house didn't try to impeach on it because it was entirely false. You're trying to show what great journalist do but Buzzfeed didn't even do the most basic research and/or validation of the document.  You just have to read through either the Mueller report or the FBI's IG report to see the actual facts...
---
I feel you. I had a rough time at the start as well. Took me a great while to have enough of everything to just do a quest. Cuz I died all the time. Its not the end of the world I learned. Dust your self of and try again try again.
---
Actually explosive build was my first build after I got above level 50 lol. Ordinance express made explosives very light so I carried a lot of grenades missiles and nukes. Then soon I realized how weak they are compared to explosive legendary effects, and all launchers break very fast so I moved to shotgun and heavy weapons etc.
---
Can't help you with more, but I only knew about anchor farm &amp; I still eventually learnt the plan. Good work :)
---
That’s what i do too, which is why I learned the plan before I could think twice
---
umm... is this even a thing ? as far as I'm aware, you can't learn to craft the metal helmet by scrapping it. I mean, I'd be happy to be proven wrong...
---
A word you obviously use and have no problems with so that tells me all I need to know about the type of person you are. You and the harassing player would probably get along great. If you'd like I can set y'all up a lil chat date and you guys can argue over who's got the better shit excuse for being a bigot ☺️
---
No, he could be in some pedo’s spank bank. Just tryin to be helpful, no need for a ‘tude dude.  Maybe that’s why u b gettin harassed.
---
Seriously!  They assume 500 people even play this game anymore!?  How optimistic of them!
---
Congrats!! Achievements like this are special for sure!

I just don't need to be talked to like a child I know what the internet is I wouldn't have a picture up if I wasn't comfortable with it. And yes because I made a sarcastic reply to you're comment that's why I get racial slurs used against me and personal insults lobbed at me. Nailed it!
---
You can mate, I've learnt it.
---
Yeah it would 👍
---
Oh no, really? 😔
---
...I'm sure this makes sense in your world.
---
You continue to amaze me with your genius wit 😂 there's a million other places you can try and be a shit stirrer pal why can't you take your antics somewhere else ?
---
There are a few in the mezzanine level of top of the world
---
Yeah I agree it’s super fun indeed. A while back when I used grenades more I often waited when a few of those super mutants and scorched walk closer to each other, kaboom you can take out more than one. Now that i learned the plan maybe it’s time for explosive warfare again lol
---
that's rich coming from you.
---
current year, bigot, you got all the buzzwords. I'm sure twitter already crowned you with their blue virtue signal but you'd probably fare better there, haha
---
Yep, you’re wrong. To my knowledge metal helmets and combat armor helmets can be learned via scrapping. On pc I believe you can learn the unreleased marine combat helmet plan via scrapping as well.
---
Game is pure trash, they technically are not wrong
---
Huh, good to know. Guess imma go scrap a bunch of helmets then &gt;&lt;
---
I don't live in twitter land or a major gaming news outlet for the mentally handicapped so yes, it does.
---
This happens ever 5 god damn minutes with the santatron. Makes me wish the turrets would turn on me to end my suffering.
---
"Look at me Mom I'm arguing that it's alright to be racist are you proud of me" literally you rn 😭😂😂
---
I found that it may help to scrap metal armor at the same time, but maybe I was lucky?
---
You madlad. Congrats!

lol I don’t know if I’m one unit or one hundred units away from becoming a legend. The last one I unlocked was reflex sight, only one left to unlock, I suspect it’s also a sight, maybe recon or NV.
---
I usé be and AAE láser, I can kill 5 supermutant with one shot lol. The problem is the durability oficial this weapon, I usé too be and AAE wester
---
I’m the same way! I stick to Sims, Planet Zoo, Fallout, Skyrim, Detroit Become Human, and Red Dead Redemption. 
---
I’m a terrible shot so I usually level up my charisma and health first, that way I can sweet talk people and run away when it goes south. 
---
The nice thing about games like Fallout is that you can play it several times and experience new situations each time you play. I’d recommend leveling different skills each time so you can see which skills you personally prefer having. If you like combat, damage, health, and shooting skills are usually the way to go. If you prefer a calmer story, charisma, lock-picking, and carry capacity might be better. If you’re not sure yet, try them all! :) 
---
Good luck out there.
---
It is white knighting to downplay the fact that all that shit did haplen and Bethesda continues to fuck over their buyers
---
" major gaming news outlet for the mentally handicapped " 
---
So hang on, to your mind; -not- being a racist = being mentally handicapped ?
---
My tip to you: quit this trash then buy and play Fallout 4 with mods. An infinite better experience. This game is just a trainwreck of bad decisions and poor development
---
when you equate saying ****** to being literally Hitler as the modern left does, then yes, you're most definitely mentally challenged.
---
Why are you interacting with him is beyond me. Just block him. Smh why people feed the trolls. You have all the tools needed to not have to talk to any of them, yet you don't use them then complain.
---
No thanks, at least I know the bugs in there at the moment.  If they reworked it from the ground up I'd have to learn dozens of completely new annoying bugs.
---
Honestly the game deserves more hate, it shouod be shutdown and brought back as a full game a la ffxiv
---
There is zero chance of this.
---
Your analogy would only work if you first mentioned steve stole your shoes off of your feet from 300 yards away and then kick you in the face from 90ft high in the air
---
.....I actually agree with Remzoh, other here are just gonna stab you in the back later by stealing whatever they can from you. (Also so much more)
---
This game will be a huge drain on your time and more importantly your money. (Literally will try to rob you again and again by trying to make you feel good temporarily) 
---
Seriously, if you want an actual good game, get OUTER WORLDS.
---
(History never Changes)
---
I did not interact with the guy at all after my first encounter. He messaged me today after killing me I guess to rub it in and said what he said. I blocked and reported him. I don't know how that is feeding him when he's gotten no reaction from me personally. I just felt like sharing the story so hopefully Bethesda can get on top of disciplining toxic players such as him. Love the automatic judgement from you, really helpful!
---
Fact is that shit did happen and every few weeks its something new and terrible. Journalists arent the problem here
---
Wellp Goodwin's law invoked! Annnnd there's the "left" argument too, quelle surprise. 
---
Using words like that, even when there's no one around to be offended normalises racism. Normalising racism leads to \*Bad Things **™** \*
---
It's a lesson we learn from history over and over again, and going about thin skinned liberal lefties ain't gonna change it or make that shit acceptable in a world that knows better.
---
One of my friends is going through this.  It's got to the stage where he's trying to use a service to find the other guy's IP address via his PSN name, to DDoS him.  Because he thinks he's being victimized.  He's just escalating things and giving the other guy the drama and attention he wanted - but you think I can convince my friend to just drop it and block him?? Sigh.
---
Yes, specially loading world and raid
---
I think you could rationally explain to your friend that it is not worth it. Really? Going to those lengths is just absurd. If you can't convince him, maybe find new friends because this guys sounds very vindictive and he might snap at you one day too.
---
Everyone who supports 76 so much in this abusive relationship is super depressed. Every day there is a new post on this sub from a borderline suicidal person coming here and saying they needed the "community" and the game is their solace in aloneness and depression. Its fucking creepy how often it gets posted
---
I saw a YT video the other day of a kid crying over his items being stolen by a group of bullies. It was very painful to watch :(
---
Eh, this is 76. We'd totally have nuked the snow till it evaportated just to see if we got special flux &gt;&lt;
---
Hi bro, if you Are in PC can join us and do the 3 dificulties in about 40 minutes.

You Need 162 for the 6 pieces PA 
---
Right now I am going for my 3* PA
---
Thanks for the  feedback everyone. Just started up. I look forward to being a part of this community!
---
It started PvPing mainly because I got tired of people griefing low levels, myself and friends. It can be fun with the right people though.
---
Of course they were in the absolute last place I checked. Two helmets here in the Peak Condition store, thanks a lot I’ll update main post.
---
I don’t think like that so I didn’t think about that but your right
---
It usually works but for some reason not working like that at my new camp but I’ll keep trying thanks
---
ahh happens to me too with some of my camps, i found if i want to have them spawn somewhere i need a bit of space between the building and the  camp border (for example, if i want them to spawn in front of my house, i leave lots of space for a front yard and they’ll typically spawn there)
---
Ok, This player was level 125, I am 60. I guess He was bored. I take it it’s not worth taking up the pvp fighting with people that high level?
---
What's your source that it has millions?
---
Oh, right, you don't have one. Well done for making no point whatsoever.
---
Ok I’ll try that thanks
---
Welcome to the brotherhood
---
Well, sure.
---
But I'm also interested in them ironing out performance issues and visually improving the areas of the game that for lack of better words  just look unpleasant and a WIP.    I don't mind 76, but I do hate how sometimes it looks far less consistent visually than Fallout 4 while performing WORSE.
---
I never usé mod, it safe user its?
---
&gt;only a small number of characters have been negatively affected
---
Don't forget the number of 500 is from ONE guy in ONE night , we can't count but can imagine how many was "hacked" considering the hack was available for public + the fact only a few hacker have record their crime.  
---
Anyways it's a lot lot more than 500 hacked.
---
Without moving points around...
---
Strength: Its gonna sound strange but I'd focus on getting weight reduction perks, namely Traveling Pharmacy, Ordnance Express, Bear Arms, Martial Artist, and Scattershot. I'd use Junkie weapons, since the condition required to max its damage boost is easy to attain and maintain (just get five addictions that don't impact any specials you're focusing on). Since you mentioned shotguns focus on modding them to lessen weapon spread and aim for the chest.
---
Perception: Perks seem fine as is if you're focusing on upping damage potential. For exploration I'd choose all Picklocks and the perks that provide audio cues when near a magazine, bobblehead, and caps stash.
---
Endurance: Could go for Lead Belly and Rejuvenated. You'll be able maintain being Well Fed and Well Hydrated with ease while reaping their enhanced benefits.
---
Charisma: Looks fine, though I feel you could drop Suppressor and fill the spot with utility perks like Field Surgeon and Travel Agent.
---
Intelligence: Gunsmith is fine, plus its enough intelligence to switch perks around based on crafting needs. If you're not too worried about maintaining weapon durability I'd switch out for all Hacker perks for exploration.
---
Agility: I'd switch out Enforcer for Thru-Hiker, primarily for hoarding more consumables. I feel in most encounters involving a shotgun you're already too close for cripple to matter, and that 1 or 2 shots is enough to put down the enemy for stagger to matter. I don't know if its coincidence but there's times where I shoot and melee an enemy, causing a stagger, before landing a second shot.
---
Luck: They seem fine. The OCD in me would choose a 1 point perk instead of the rank 1 Lucky Break. Or get rank 1 Ricochet or rank 1 Quick Hands.
---
Hella sweet grats 👍🏻
---
You guys should hold Bethesda this accountable for how many lies they've fed down your throat but continue to swallow.
---
I had this happen a few weeks ago while I was working on my camp.  My camp is just inside the area for the event.
---
Good to sport the furries
---
I mean spot the furries
---
The games awful and should be reported as so
---
Anyway good job OP! Now tell us about the paddleball
---
Top of world area. The roadblock just down the road from the station. In a display case with a corpse lying over it.
---
Sorry can't remember the names of location. My console don't play discs any more 😦
---
Well spoken sir
---
Correct. This is the south cutthroat camp location I have listed, thanks for the input though.
---
"get over it" k. I'll ignore the entire span of bethesda bug support history.
---
I have never read something so ridiculous in my life lmao "I refuse to abide by your stupid antics" so you'll just be a racist douche bag just to stick it to someone? Go get your head checked man you got something seriously wrong going on in there
---
Well I never found I was short on stimpaks or radaway so I found I just need these, but you could always swap them in if needed. By later levels you will have perk points to spare and can switch cards around, see what works.
---
Bethesda doesn't care that NW has scarecrows flying around headshotting people across the map with a combat shotgun, they certainly won't care about somebody saying a few mean words over voice chat
---
nah, ain't worth the time., rookies use power armor in NW; Power armor users are free kills. 
---
No purpose on using power armor in NW unless you're fulfilling the big gun perk niche.
---
Using power armor for taking less damage is kind not worth. Sacrificing mobility, delay after every frog leg jump, big hit box, etc.
---
Iron Clad - This perk will provide marine armor users just about the same armor as Power Armor provides. Hell, scout armor even feels good with iron clad. Marine and Scout armor/ Iron Clad users will not suffer the same cons as mentioned for Power Armor.
---
TLDR - I wrote power armor sucks and a reason why cuz im bored. Just take my 2 cents.
---
Are you really surprised? The reason so many people went to Youtubers in the first place for their gaming news is that Games "Journalism" and "Journalists" have been going downhill for the better part of a decade.
---
The three standard responses of a modern games "journalist" these days is "I agree with it's politics so it's good." "I disagree with it's politics so it's bad" and "It doesn't take a big enough political stance so it's evil."
---
You get the rare "Journalist" who remembers their job is to actually provide non-clickbait news but it's getting rarer every day. And the ones who do try? Well, as you saw yourself, the sourcing is getting worse too every day.
---
Dude even Fox is reporting that shit, BuzzFeed ain't good news.
---
They will fix it but you wont lose the item. Same thing happened to the PA paints a long time ago.

Battlefield (Frostbite Engine): Hackers/Cheaters exist  
---
Counter-Strike (Source): Hackers/Cheaters exist  
---
Any Multiplayer Game (Any Engine): Hackers/Cheaters exist  
---
See where I'm going with this?  
---
The difference between Fallout 76 and Battlefield/CSGO is that EA and Valve will ban you if you hack/cheat and Bethesda will just give you a slap on wrist with a 3-Day suspension. That's the actual problem here.
---
Available for 50 caps in my vendor if your on Xbox
---
... really? You can see it in the build menu. Even if you don't have the plans, you can see it (and how it would like), but cannot place
---
the left is the one who's always casually bringing Hitler up. you can't blame me for denouncing their behavior.
---
&gt;normalizing racism leads to bad things
---
but that's my point, now isn't it? you're making a big fuss out of nothing. the left often does. and no, I'm not necessarily calling you a leftist. just saying that's their mo. because saying ****** online isn't gonna bring lynchings back.
---
that's why nobody takes multi-colored hair weirdos seriously. because you can't imply racism, in \*&gt;the current year, is a thing people have to realistic fear outside of some easily avoided harassment once in a blue moon.
---
not to mention these words all but lost their meaning. people spout "N" and "F" as to say damn or loser.
---
Imagine shilling for Fallout 76 lol
---
you might be on to something, the first high quality i crafted gave me a mothman mount.
---
Dude yes please

Dont happen to have a glowing one do ya?

Wow such a idiot moment.

the funny part is that you people sound like lawyers. and you're doing it for free.

"sure Joe here ran over a bunch of kids in a daycare during a drunken rage- **but he wasn't over the speed limit!** plus he apologized to the families and offered them 500 atoms in compensation."

it doesn't matter if they got X, Y or Z wrong. scrutinizing every article or video out there isn't gonna change the big picture, that these things should **not** happen. none of what's happened this past week, or this past year really, is acceptable.
---
Hijacking this, my bad, but do you keep the scrap box even if you just have one month and don’t renew? Can you keep using it onwards?
---
Absolutely.
---
I'd be willing to wait up to three months for relaunch if it meant nearly bugfree and 100% dupe and cheat free game.
---
I have those and weapon reduction armor still not enough
---
Ive got the outfit for sale at my camp, i ground the tokens, got the outfit then realised that my halloween suit is more rare and looks better 😂so i put it up for sale
---
I'm down to hardly any caps because I keep buying paper. Still haven't seen plasma grenades, but do I have a collection of Mounted plans to sell.
---
Is garbage xD
---
They may not have been using up their stimpaks. There's a charisma perk card where you can revive downed players with alcohol. Alcohol is fairly plentiful in the game... you can find it laying around free in many locations, and it can also be crafted.  I don't remember the animation changing when the revive with alcohol card was used, although it's been awhile since I've used it. There's also a stimpak recipe in the game, so I often deliberately craft extra stimpaks to give away to other people.  
---
Most of us went through the same tutorial experience... which is to say, there are many things which the game does not make obvious and/or clearly explain how they work. Especially with the camp building system. It's really common for new players not to immediately notice and/or understand how the paper bag works... if you keep playing, you'll see the extent to which many of these things are definitely not just you ;)
---
re: your patient new friend &amp; "probably a guy"... That's probably accurate in many games, but in this one I think it's somewhat hard to say. So far the people I've played with have been fairly diverse... every gender, ages 8-67 or so, a variety of countries / ethnicities / etc etc... and their character doesn't always reflect their IRL gender either of course. I'm on PS4 though so dunno about other platforms...
---
Yeah, just like there's no proof the Nazis killed millions, it was probably just a few hundred.
---
^/s ^for ^those ^without ^a ^brain
---
Just curious, how many caps do you charge for the outfit at your vendor machine?
---
welcome to the club! I am halfway to a second one :-)
---
I've spent 1400hrs grinding and getting the gear I want on three main character builds. I wouldn't want it wiped...
---
Didn't look for paper but I was able to farm Santas. Although the spawn rate was much lower than before....
---
All in once? Usually 1 apparel item is the reward not 5. Not to mention they are the most rarest rewards what you can ever get
---
I got plasma grenade plans from my 8th small gift.
---
Your on PC? Pretty sure I took a picture at your base a while back.  Looks suspiciously like one of my loading screen pics!!
---
So a fairly high level player harvesting flux for Ultracite Ammo dies to 3 Scorchbeasts? I had a couple there a few days ago and had the Legendary run off and come back full Health, I did chase her. ;)
---
 So the first Level 65 I killed was OK but used up far too much ammo. After the Legendary got her Health back I was down to Plasma and 44. Went in Station and tried to make ammo. No. So I shot at her with the 44 till she landed and killed her silly ass with my new toy, The Plasma Puker. Bone stock it just melts everything, including half dead Scorchbeasts. I've killed 3 with it so far. ;)
---
You can get ps+ for free
---
&gt;  why do you keep playing
---
Because it's fun.
---
&gt; and defending this game?
---
Because lots of the criticism is incorrect.
---
No but Omg.. Imagine when you would turn it on, it would be ultracite green and emit radiation in the cone of light.
---
They are actually blogger who went into reporting later.

Step 1: uninstall fallout 76. 
---
Step 2: download any other fallout game. 
---
Step 3: enjoy. 
---
Maybe come back to fallout 76 in 10 years when it’s all sorted. 👍

To be fair all of the sources you list have reported on all the updates and positive things added to the game HOWEVER everytime Bethesda does an update they brake something so that gets mentioned in the same article which is exactly what they should be doing covering both things... 
---
Bethesda have spent the last year basically playing whack a mole with bugs and hacks and have done nothing to prevent them in the first place...
---
Bethesda also made alot of promises about F76 on the lead up and shortly after launch all of which they broke and even did a blog post in October? that said due to reasons we are going to do whatever we want tough luck.
---
All the problems with the game was made worse by them releasing a subscription to the game for feature's that should be free... No other game live service game charges for private instances, imagine having to pay a subscription to play GTAV Online in invite only mode thats exactly what Bethesda is doing lol
---
Edit: not sure why all the downvotes. It's not my fault some aren't working. All I say is I'm on PS4, in the UK, and I STILL have access to wrap, and holiday scorched.
---
There is a wolf pack event at the fair ground north of the vault, do this for a couple of legendaries and some meat you can cook and sell. Get perks like pharma farmer or can do and just search every container, chems and drugs sell best but food sells well too.
---
Don't drink the water without boiling it
---
Bloodied+FFR or bloodied+50 VATS crit only will be good; AA, Instigation, junkie - all of them is trash. Good choice for sneak build is 45 pipe revolver, 38 pipe and 10mm. For non-sneak - only plasma pistols with FFR and 50 VATS crit (first as flamethrower, second is with snipe barrel).
---
I can help you with builds and gear choice. Play with pistols since start.
---
Explosive pistols is full trash cause explosive don't add lot of damage. Are you think it gives 20% damage boost? Nope. It gives 20% to base damage (without legendary effects, mutations, headshots, sneak damage modifier, etc), so, if BE 10mm do 700 damage, explosive do 15-20 damage only
---
I use a geforce GTX 1070 graphics card at the lowest possible settings! There is no excuse for that. With each update my game crashes more often. It's not just me. Either you don't follow community posts or you are misunderstanding.
---
Fo76 only has "a few players" left playing the game.
---
Yea the vent is stoppong the 31st
---
Do you remember the reload/legendary effect cancellation bug? Polish gaming magazine CD-Action published an article about it with this headline: "A bug introduced in the new update destroys in-game armors"
---
Bloodied with PA? You'd be better off with a legendary unyielding set using dense/lead lined mods to get explosive and rad resist. If you use mutations then getting rad shield is a must also
---
This is probably the first time I actually will side with gaming journalist making a game look bad. The company lost respect in my books so this is karma at its finest.
---
Not really anything lazy about pointing out visceral nerd rage
---
Get the speed demon mutation
---
I mean I have like 10 mutations active but that one seems to fix it
---
I don't like false journalism, fake news or anything. But for us specifically, the big villain is Bethesda. She is extremely greedy. We're paying dearly for her mistakes with a flawed game. She needs a slap in the face, or several! But I understood your point. 👍🏻
---
Oh, so that's what that was. An unmarked fissure site near my camp had that visual ultracite ore vain that I could not see but it spawned the scorched every time including the holiday ones. At that time I was teamed up with a random player and he dumped many of his legendries as well as gifts for me afterwards. It was wonderful &lt;3
---
&gt; And the conclusion is that a man that steals from others is so trustworthy we should take his word for it? Really?
---
Then why do you trust Bethesda?
---
Certain effects stack, but not others. 
---
You can only be under the effect of one Bobblehead at at times. Only one magazine at a time. Only one Chem at a time. 
---
Food &amp; drink will stack, but some effects will only be enabled based on the most recent. Example: Canned Meat Stew gives +5% XP for an hour. Cranberry Relish grants +10% XP for an hour. 
---
If you eat the Relish first, then the Meat Stew, you only get the benefit of the Meat Stew, not the Relish.
---
Pretty sure it only disappears if you die right after scorched earth ends
---
Sometimes, you gotta look beyond the label, my friend.
---
That was on reddit and the itas there loved it
---
Well I have Max AGI and STR allowing me to get the most out of the respective resistance mods, using unarmed weapons can be good if you have the talons mutation like me, or you can just use twisted muscles on it's own.
---
Now that's a generous deal already
---
Spotted the hidden Bethesda employee trying to fix the bad mood of the majority.
---
You can be under the influence of multiple chems, this is incorrect. I can take a buff out and a psycho. I however cannot take a psychobuff and a psycho.
---
3.8% occurrence?  Pretty sure that’s a lot for that particular plan.
---
It's fun
---
Well I bought the game at launch, that's the only money I've spent. The game has improved tbh and I expect will. So since I own the game, I continue to play.
---
How can you be so sure? I remember posts from yesterday when the event was prematurely ended on consoles (before Bethesda reactivated it) that people had their gift wrapping disappear from their inventories. :-/
---
I'm pretty sure the gifts will stay, though, so you'd better use up all the wrapping paper before the 31st. Better safe than sorry.
---
never played any fallout?
---
Wow, you've been missing out big time
---
I'm sorry fo76 is the first game you're playing since sims.
---
I heard the previous games are good but I'm more of a racing game guy
---
But objectively a 2.13% percent chance is rare.
---
I don't know why they didn't do this. It would have been easier and required no server rental and maintenance on their part due to peer hosting and Borderlands has already proven that the model is not only popular, it works without incident when done correctly.
---
It actually is a great game. Most of the people who say negative things about it, haven't even played it before. 
---
This is why it is a good game:
---
- open world
---
- it's a Fallout game
---
- the map is huge
---
- many places to discover 
---
- lots of different weapons to choose
---
- multiplayer and singleplayer (you can walk around alone or in a team)
---
- lots of quests
---
- lots of main quests
---
- lots of events
---
- you can nuke some places
---
- you aren't forced to participate in PvP
---
- you got a camp in which you can build your house
---
- lots of monsters
---
- Fallout 76 is a shooter
---
- friendly community 
---
- you can do whatever you want to
---
Etc.
---
There are still so many reasons why Fallout 76 is a bad game.
---
If you want to try it, then play it. It is really fun.
---
I mean I got the game just to experience how bad it was (we weren't disappointed), I wouldn't consider it a fallout game but just a shitty spin off. 
---
Radio has some good songs I guess, and the game would look nice if the engine didn't keep shitting itself, not a fallout game though. 
---
But yeah Todd and his money making scemes I don't like and won't pay for
---
Bought for 10$ its fun.
---
Don't feed the troll, everyone just report this copy paste spam and the mods will remove it.
---
For the same reason you play your racing games: We enjoy it.
---
It's not copied from anywhere. And I don't see the post violating any rules.
---
I'm just curious why people play this game with the tons of negative reviews it got.
---
It would really be just for PC because the only the threats are hackers and console is good to go on that front.
---
No, which sucks because the raid power armor uses ultracite mods and so I cant get a headlamp.
---
Go to the BMNN discord we have one
---
You never cease to amaze!
---
The video in question has the same couple of people being hit multiple times. The hack took their pipboy. They had to log out and back in to get it back so that they could put armour on again. And every time the hacker just happened to be in the same server they joined? That's really bad luck to keep running into the same hacker over numerous logins.
---
( Read everything i said before down voting after only reading my first sentence pls )
---
You see, the first sentence is where i'm going to stop you. You haven't played it, you have only watched videos on it. and that's the problem. A lot of YouTubers that you watch haven't played the game even, but they make videos just to keep their views high. Its like they all jump on the hate train because thats what the people want to see.
---
Okay so i play on Xbox, and honestly its really not as bad as all the video reviews makes it look. No im not saying this game is bug less or anything. The game definitely needs work. There is bugs, there is glitches. And yes things like the hacking on PC is bad, it really is. But me as an Xbox player do not have those problems. A lot of problems is because of the hackers. Again, the game has bugs and really have problems that has to be fixed. I also laughed at the game and made fun of it, but when i got the chance to buy the game for $12, I decided to see if it really that bad. And no, its not that bad. I love playing it. I spend hours every day playing it cause I enjoy it. The only problems that i have ran into was server crashes ( about once a week at most, but recently even less) and low frame rates at certain parts of the map. Another one is some object textures don't render like it should, but that's mostly some big rocks. This is really all problems i have ran into thus far.
---
 I'm not even going to start with the community cause every ( or well most) games have a pretty good player base, but the player base is amazing.
---
Does Bethesda have a lot of work left for the game? Yes definitely. Is it worth playing on PC at this current state? No.  Is it $60 worth? meh i don't think so. I love the game but some things ( like i mentioned above) needs to be fixed and improved in order to be called a AAA game.
---
So yeah there is the reasons ( kinda) why i still play it and why i enjoy playing it. I hope you were able to read up to this point and i hope you understand why i still play this game every day.
---
There is my long reason and explanation. I hope you understand it from my point of view.
---
Stop reading blogs for actual journalism and you'll be fine lol
---
If you got 2 steel that means you only beat it on Novice. There is no timer and far less enemy spawns. 2 steel and some bulk ammo seems appropriate for beating the tutorial for the raid solo or not.
---
go back to your manga children cartoons, and leave us be...byyyye
---
Thanks for getting back to me. I already have one, but I was just asking to make sure you got the most out of it. I think 10k is a very generous price indeed, and you could get a lot more from it :) Just throwing my advice here, maybe sell it for more, or even keep it and use it to trade for a weapon you want :) People are a little short on caps since the Christmas event, but give it a week or two and in my opinion, you could get at least 20k caps or more :)
---
Thanks Buddy &lt;3
---
Thank you 👌🏻🙏
---
Awwww is someone a little salty that they have to go through my history? Awww here's a cookie for your efforts. How's FuckyouFirst? And how's your ass after taking up that Bethesdick?
---
yep, this is the tine of the post. lol
---
You keep the scrapbox and everything in it. You just can't add more scrap.
---
Congrats! I bought mine for 75,000 caps lol you have the patience of a saint.
---
Tbh I'm actually surprised about the ammount of comments saying the game is actually good. It's only that from the outside, the game looks(or made appear) terrible. Also not a big fan of MTX anywhere. That made me curious about why people still play this game. Here's my upvote to you, sir
---
I'm already trying to get a large quantity of gauss and plasma ammunition for the new Plasma Caster and Gauss Pistol. I kinda hope some new legendaries do convince me to change and adapt. I'd hate to think I'll be inside the same BOS Combat gear forever.
---
Nice!
---
This guy knows what's up.
---
You can spawn that bot?
---
Do you think they let him choose a perk for all his unused stats? I wonder what mutations he runs with. His build almost certainly uses the "well paid" buff.
---
Any special Stat given from a consumable will be overwritten by any other of the same type, but the other effects stack.
---
Might be a leftover, i doubt that it changes anything.
---
But on that note, you can add a ton of lines from fallout 4 that do in fact work, some need to go in your custom ini, some need go directly in the prefs ini.
---
It should tell you if you scroll down the challenges list from the map
---
Not when there are over 150 plans that can drop. 
---
That averages out to a 0.6% chance for each plan. *(And I’m pretty sure it’s actually more than 150, so the average chance s actually smaller.)*
---
I had a spare uplink when I did it on Xbox, it didn't change the quest for me, are you checking the right workbench menu?
---
Todd Howard bones your mom.
---
Question.  Do u make this big a stink when u request a refund from a big name store and it takes 3-5 days to get ur refund back.    
---
Same logic.  They took ur money instant they should be able to refund instant right?
---
yep, I think it makes the most sense too. March has Doom Eternal and I think they want to get it out before other releases coming like cyberpunk and what not.
---
Those seem to only be the challenge badges, turns out the 4 parts u do first atemt specifically listed 3 repeatable &amp; the one I missed was stealing from a super mutant camp xD
---
Man, you must be a dross toss boss!
---
I bet you’re popular.
---
Can we call out the shit known as Bethesda too then? FPS drops like a hammer on Xbox X and my Gaming PC when combat begins and even videos were done comparing performance showing how poorly made this game is.
---
It's not a direct copy and paste but its like kids on class changing each other's homework so the teacher wont noticed they copied. Ots the same trolling post that we get a couple times a week. Its spam and that's why it was removed.
---
So it's even more rare.... either way its rare.
---
I had no intention of trolling or spamming. From the outside, the game looks(or made to appear) terrible, so I wanted to know why the people who still play this game do it. I was proven wrong and got my answer.
---
In the case of a free content update to an existing game, the time between announcement and release can be much shorter. It is difficult to keep the planned release of a full game a secret a few months before launch, because retail distribution needs to be prepared, it needs to be given an age rating and the boards responsible for that have public records, and the marketing campaign is more extensive as well. Nuclear Winter launched on the day following the first trailer. For Wastelanders, I would expect something in between, maybe a few weeks.
---
CAMP budget must be addressed before Wastelanders comes out. 
---
Bethesda doesnt understand that they keep adding Camp stuff to the Atom shop but no where to put it.
---
Happy hunting!
---
You are more than welcome you can also farm the snallygastee hoard event but its not as fast and it’s more difficult.
---
Thanks man. And yeah I used to be on that hate train also but ever since i played it myself, i loved it. People usually judge before testing it out themselves. But im glad you read everything and see that its really not as bad as it seems.
---
Have a great holiday!
---
I have a sneaky suspicion that it currently works like this: "You get your atoms when we get our money."  I believe this because people report various lengths of time before they get their atoms. This seems likely because various financial institutions take varying times to "process the payment." So, while it may show on your card that you paid, the card service may not have actually processed and sent the payment yet.
---
FTR, I'm not promoting this, plenty of companies deliver the product while waiting for the "processing" to complete. Further more, it's a suspicion, I am not claiming I "know" anything.
---
Sealing from a super mutant camp? What?
---
Id get the year for PS+ if you decide to keep it.
---
Sounds like one of Rose's quest for the raiders not a Scout quest.
---
Nocturnal, assassins, cloaked instant script no matter the roll on it.
---
Are you referring to a headlamp mod for ultracite power armor or an ultracite mod for the mining headlamp?
---
I’ve tried all of them and no dice only quest item option I have is signal repeater from the previous quest and modify/repair is blank and empty
---
Major buff to the godrays skill.
---
This game pisses me off when it throws so many godrays and fog at the same time, to the point where you can't see more than 2 feet in front of you.
---
It may or may not include details about the release date, but I think there might be new information in next week's Inside the Vault (January 2). This is the first one after the holiday break, and it was said earlier that more detailed Wastelanders articles will come after the new year.
---
There's the orange shag carpet that was free on the Atom shop a few months,back.
---
They only launched those modes to follow the sheep on this BR crusade.  Everyone trying for that fortnite money.
---
No
---
Ok so I gave up ended up taking Poseidon for the cores and about 15 minutes after first issue I suddenly randomly have uplink as a crafting option 🤔😅
---
The people I play with are pretty chill. Im always trying to lend a hand whenever possible.
---
Yes they are. How much hording do you do?
---
Have we confirmed that the hack is no longer viable? Has anyone been affected since the hot patch?
---
Yall are missing his point completely.  It has 0 to do with whether or not 76 is a good game or not, or deserving of bad press or not, and everything to do with the fact that gaming "journalism" has sunk to being nothing more than a rehash of popular reddit posts.
---
Look at almost any article about the Division up through the 1.8 update.  Nothing more than a summary of the reddit at the time.
---
Look at any Forbdes article about Anthem.  There are places where the writers actually plagiarized peoples entire posts.
---
That's his point.  That gaming "journalism" has become so low brow that it's nothing more than a copy paste of popular social media posts.  And hes right.
---
More than i should but i dont like moving weapons risky venture rifles are heavy no refuction perk and unless u waste the slot for heavy weapons those are gna weigh alot
---
I use nukesdragons.com to set my final build and use the leveling roadmap. It's not perfect but it helps. Keep in mind that when you level up, that SPECIAL you choose is where you put your point. Then you can take any card available in any SPECIAL, just use Z/C LB/RB to navigate to another SPECIAL.
---
And whats wrong with the 20+ guides that comes up in google?
---
Each of you should get a 10mm pistol. One of you used that to ‘tag’ an enemy in VATS, then switch to another enemy. The other uses their main weapon to finish the job.  Trade off from time to time. 
---
Molotov Cocktails also work well to tag multiple enemies before the other does the rest of the damage, and also for tagging the mobs before the turrets light them up. 
---
Try placing your turrets in a central location and patrol around them to get to the enemies first. Then after you’ve tagged them, move back to the turret area and let them finish up.
---
Grafton steel mills a good place follow the belt up to the tower and pick up the more along the way to the top then just snipe the mutants from up there after you think it's safe go building to building. I do this so much I know where their gonna be several always sit down in the same place I just run in and popem in the head. I have made up to 800 caps here.
---
Ive got people who do this once in a blue moon. I just ignore them, go on and do my thing. I run with pacifist on and if anyone on my team wants PvP, i leave the team.
---
If I want PvP, ill go do a few matches In Nuclear Winter.
---
It's still possible to get all the perks you want/need after level 50, it just takes a little longer. After level 50, you can pick either a perk card or the option to move a point from one SPECIAL stat to another. If you've found you're spec'd wrong for what you want, just use that to move points around where you want them, and get the perk cards you want. You also still get the perk card packs every 5 levels, even after 50.
---
Shitty journalism doesn't negate the Beth shitshow.
---
I use 9 large water purifiers at my camp to produce 45 units. I’ll let them restock about 3-4 times. Takes me about 2 hours but it’s doesn’t really matter while grinding. Then I’ll take those to a vendor (I use hard bargain 2 since I’m only allowed 2 points for luck). About 150 purified waters yields about 600 caps with HB2. Even more if you stack with grape mentats. Pretty lucrative if I do say so myself.
---
Yah i actually only get 3mgb takes me at least for 4 days for 50g
---
The point of the post was to show how shitty games journalism has become, not saying Bethesda is good or not.
---
Plus, Rockstar pulls in god-knows how much from shark cards which pay for a quarter of a new car so I mean...
---
This is why I favorite the outfits I don't want to lose when I'm wearing them. I may have lost a few good outfits that way
---
Exactly what I thought nuclear winter was. I should just ignore and do as you do.
---
Are you over encumbered?
---
Jesus, you need to update
---
The reports on it should at least be accurate
---
I don't. Don't need to. He made a claim. They are not involved in it. Not trusting a hacker does not involve trusting Bethesda.
---
Thank god for him, and thank god for me, but especially thank god for him. DOODOOO DOODO DOOO DOOO DOO
---
most guides are in plain text, as is this reddit
---
it seems you're not giving us all the info we need, how can we guide you, if you cant explain your limitations?
---
I run with 2 rifles. Handmade and gauss rifle. With deep pockets armor and ballistic backpack I have on average 40 to 50 lbs of space open to store stuff.
---
Groups don’t need to tag to get drops.  If ur close to enemies when they die u get the loot but no xp.
---
Congrats. I got super lucky and found a full suit in a train station vendor.
---
your right and wrong - the turrets have a max range but they also have a max perception range - the spotlights perception is higher then standard turrets as such when it spots a enemy they are also able to see them and thus fire at a longer range then normal 
---
this has been well documented in both fallout 4 and fallout 76 by hundreds of defense guides
---
FYI, the Nuclear Winter Beanie and the Fur Lined Jacket that you get as rewards are tradable items. Meaning, the person who earns it can make infinite copies of them to sell/give away. I was able to get each for 300 caps last night. Xbox is full of people selling, just check the LFG posts in the official club.
---
Wait dontwe already have them with foundation and floor skins?
---
I get really burned out by any writer who has to spend a good chunk of their source material quoting people on reddit. You can cite your sources, but not keep on saying so and so on particular subreddit. I could do that shit all day...I kinda spend all day here anyhow. That is not any form of journalism. It is like using wikipedia as your sole source or something.
---
I have posted the how to that u/SaukPuhpet did a few times. I really think everyone should learn how to do this and do it at least once, it's a part of the game and it isn't easy. Anyone can alt+tab and go to nukacrypt but there's not much challenge in that.
---
Yep, happens on PS4 for me too. Especially if I'm walking a long distance, I get the sound effect like I've been hit and the screen goes blurry, but no damage.
---
I logged.in and out a couple of times
---
as a lower level you want to work your way down towards the ash heap first, enemies up there do scale upwards, but will not scale up to level 68 or above if a higher level player has been there. forest area will almost always spawn weak enemies
---
Unless you are selling legendaries you don't need a lot. And even then you can get max caps stash without needing to sell them
---
As long as People still Support this shithole of a company, they will go always full denial mode
---
seriously have non of you guys seen the like 100s of defense videos / guides / freaking reddit pages where people tested all this stuff in both fallout 76 and fallout 4 
---
here let me copy and paste from a guide real fast (typed fallout 76 what are spotlights for in google)
---
Adding **Spotlights** “**Spotlights** are much better at targeting enemies, and when a **spotlight** targets something all the turrets with line-of-sight will also target it. As a result, a few **spotlights** will dramatically increase the effectiveness of your turrets.
---
Ye...i remember my first time walking out of Vault 111(my first real experience on fallout game) i was scared shitless and also excited!!!The wasteland is a wonderful place,full of amazing things and also full of terrifying monsters!Take your time,explore everything,read every damn terminal entry and every scrap of note!Gather junk,build your base and enjoy the post apocalypse to it's fullest!
---
your edits out of date by several months
---
Only if they can make sure that the mats aren’t placed where a visitor isn’t set up for a trap, or only if the owner is the only one that is affected by the mat. 
---
Otherwise, no.
---
I have it, if you want, add me ( PC ) so I can make one for you. UNCLE_Hamed
---
After 50 you can pick a perk card or move a point from one slot to another. In order to own all perk cards and have them all leveled to max you would need to be over level 500.
---
sure, but what does that have to do with false journalism ?
---
I wish they did
---
Everyone else already suggested using a lighter hitting weapon, and I agree. Why not make a couple of low level .38 pipe rifles, and aim for the legs.
---
That quote is about fallout 4...
---
Well, that's my fault then, isn't it!
---
I got this message from their support team;

&gt;Thank you for contacting Bethesda Support.

&gt;We  have resolved the exploit that resulted in some players losing items  that their characters had equipped. We are sorry to learn that you may  have been impacted by this exploit.  
---

"The development  team is investigating how we may make this right"
---
I'm legitimately scared they will just offer just 400 atoms or a month of fallout 1st and call it quits. Genuinely wishing I'd never picked up this game because of how much shit it's dropped me into.
---
People were saying the exact same thing about jon_blue and his wife losing their shit in the raid. So even if only one person notices the issue in a day or two doesn't mean it isn't happening.
---
Haha what part?
---
Since it is intentional it does.
---
These make a huge difference.  Definitely do them repeatedly.  I used to run Fertile Soil all the time too, just to get the rewards and cause it was so centrally accessible for low levels.
---
To the extent of being able to swipe inventories and spawn anything they want? It's a known fact that 76 has one of the absolute weakest anticheats in existance. Just a shitty whitelist and barely and server/client validation at all. And this is merely a game that's a year old and QUITE a good deal less popular that CS or BF.
---
A rework would be better. Removing them isn’t necessary.
---
Nor are insults.
---
their hive mind tells them that if they die to yeet their active weapon into deep space so no one can use it against them
---
Scorched are secretly using the jury rigging perk for there loot drops, as long as the weapon is "close enough" to what they were using then it just works
---
The best thing you can do if you mostly play for building is make low level alts and transfer plans from your main. It takes a bit of effort but in the long run it’s very worth it. I have 5 characters that can all build close to everything (event/quest plans are the hardest to get and I skip those mostly). It makes using new items or trying new ideas so much easier and more fun. I still have a 10-11 month old Camp on my main that is like a time capsule, a Carousel, a haunted house, a church with secret entrance, and a dunk tank camp thing haha. Having a crazy Camp on a lvl 5 is fun too :) 
---
They have said that persistent workshops are coming for private servers and that will be a game changer, and make the private “world” more worth the money imo
---
Should be interesting. They may talk almost exclusively about the holiday events and all the stats like they usually do with a small paragraph mentioning “more Wastelanders info to come” or something along those lines.
---
You ugly little spergs laughed when I said Fallout 76 could cost Bethesda their reputation and future a year and a half ago. With every waking hour I am proven to be more right. I won.
---
No sir🧐 no extra weight at the moment.
---
I just got off 10 after an hour and unlocked the broadsider and I was a bit curious are they increasing the amount and quality.
---
Couldn't find any spring 🧐🤪
---
Consoles are harder to hack but not immune. It is only a PC problem right now.
---
There are three pressure plates sticking about halfway thru the wall that you land on, they trigger a flamethrower that is behind the wall which breaks the chair, then you fall :)
---
Or craft marine wetsuit head and sell it.
---
The easiest quick cash grab i do is green thumb perk combined with Silva Homestead (140 corn) and billings farm (220 razorgrain) they're both right next to each other which is convenient. The razorgrain cells for one cap each and with hard bargain and a sweet roll I get 2 caps for each piece of corn. Between the two places you maybe have to kill 10 things and they're always either low levels scorched ghouls, or liberators. It's about as close to a quick and effortless 500 cap run that I can find in the game.

A thumbs-up or a heart emote is payment enough, I promise you. I don't fret when someone new out of the vault doesn't know how to emote at all. All of us were there once, and most of us only got as far as we did because someone else helped along the way. We're just paying it forward. You'll be able to before you know it.
---
sorry to necrobump, but in the patch they didnt specify "energy" weapons stopped dropping with explosive. it stated what weapons did.
---
From patch 5 :
---
* **Weapons:** Flamers, Cryolators, plasma weapons, and laser weapons can no longer spawn with the Explosive legendary mod.
---
* **Dev Note:** The explosive mod causes weapons to fire bullets that are . . . explosive. The weapons listed above don’t fire bullets, so we’ve temporarily removed the ability for them to spawn with that mod applied so we can make adjustments.
---
How did you think of that holy shit😂

There is a lot of advice here on melee builds, but reading your comments it sounds like you prefer ranged/stealth.  I'd suggest focusing on commando/rifleman if that is the case.  You will want to level up Agility and Perception more than anything, and focus on getting commando (you can go rifleman after level 50).  The key difference is which guns you use.  Commando uses automatic guns, where Rifleman does not.  You have a smaller hit but can do more frequent hits with the commando, but with Rifleman you have a greater range, and a bigger hit, with a longer reload (this can be painful at times).
---
Once you hit level 15 or so, commando is equal to Rifleman, but lower levels you probably want rifles just because that's what you can get.
---
Combine this with stealth perks, crouch when firing, and you can do some brutal ranged damage.
---
I have a min-maxed rifleman/commando character, which you can see here:  https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=4f346ea&amp;d=sv3pg2ph2pp2pi2p02e11eh0c72ic2ib2a72ar2a51a02l71lt2li1lu2&amp;w=aj2&amp;m=&amp;nw=&amp;n=Ash's%20Commando%20Explorer
---
This should show you what special stats to choose and cards at each level, if you wanted to follow that sort of build.
---
I started rifleman with a hunting rifle I kept maxed out, but once I could get a combat rifle I switched to that (and eventually got a fixer).
---
If you are doing rifle builds, your melee will suffer, so I also suggest keeping a shotgun around for when things get close.  It's not a great general weapon, but it's a lifesaver for when you are mobbed, especially at lower levels.
---
I dont remember all the ones i already have. I wont be able to play until Jan 1st but if you are willing i will message you when i get back.
---
Check out [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bkv3d1/vladgor2008s_bloodied_stealth_commando_build/), son. I'm fairly new to the game myself but this came up after a fairly quick search.
---
Is the quest progressing correctly now for you? I've had things like this happen with quest stages for me as well. I'm not sure if it's caused because the quest stages and activators are server side and delay can bug them out?
---
The same
---
I wouldn't complain, except for the fact that most of the rare masks were duped to death.  Which basically means that anyone who gets to have one right now received them though dubious means, whether they were aware of it or not, and I don't like rewarding that behavior by continuing to make it special.
---
They can replace what was previously rare with new rares.
---
try 100k+ players
---
I like you. I fuck with you. You chaotic little shit.
---
Its still up and running for me (PS4 Pro) I was on all day yesterday with no problems.  I did notice they do not spawn as frequently anymore though
---
I can’t see adventure mode getting a increase because of everyone built towns it would lag like never before( I mean even more than before lol)
---
the base default of them both is the same, if you want more SUCC and do not mind being close to a target, go minigun with accelerated barrel for more SUCC. 
---
i personally like the gatling laser for my SUCC though, use power user and get 1K shots per reload. more SUCC per core
---
you can say however you want. very small chance means here - nope, not gonna happen.
---
I think both of my characters have this problem too.  They aren't crippled, but their legs are constantly injured, even when no other part is, and a Stimpack doesn't fix it.
---
I don't PVP, but I had an interesting experience last night. I was running around on a low-level alt trying to level up and give random gifts to people. I bumped into a level 9 and dropped a soup and some antibiotics, which they took. they asked if I wanted to team with them. I used the "no" emote, they said "wow, ok", and started shooting at me. I forgot to turn on pacifist and did that quickly before just walking away. 
---
Kinda left a sour taste in my mouth for a bit, they just seemed incredibly rude.
---
I’m a fan of the game. I don’t care what others say. Has the game had its issues. That’s an understatement. I’m glad to see some new players too. More and more are coming out of the vault. I was playing on a server two days ago and I saw 3 new players come from the vault. I’m glad this game is still alive even though it has a crap reputation. Still excited for Wastelanders. This DLC will make or break this game and I hope it’s as good as the hype is.
---
That makes sense! Thank you
---
You need to select it in the atom shop again. It did the same to me for some reason. I also had to select my loot and drop bags again.
---
Thanks all!
---
Had the same camp for about 4 months with budget maxed. The only answer is make a new base, from scratch.
---
thats pretty awesome, never thought about hitting 15 int
---
Wow that's genius
---
You can get all the perks, but it can be pricey to reallocate points between different builds.  I’m thinking about making different alts for different builds.
---
Dude... Yall are the most absurd corpoate, ass kissing shills i have ever seen. Imagine if it was EA or Activision that was allowing all this... You all would uave burned them down ages ago...
---
I don't know if it's because you of lags but sometime I can clearly see more than one food buff in my pipboy
---
This. The fact that this game still has a playerbase, let alone people stupid enough to defend Bethesda's actions after a solid year of selling players the few things they've actually fixed, astounds me.
---
Go raid all the houses in whitespring. Take everything and you will be 500 over your limit but once you sell everything it only takes one round of raiding.
---
It is already well known that there is a small chance to get them all, as several people have posted that they got them as an event reward, and has been verified through data mining that there is a ~.015 percent chance to get them. The facts and data are there, just because you didn't know that doesn't mean it's not possible.
---
Multiple characters and a friend you trust to mule stuff around I find is needed. I have 6 characters constantly at cap for caps. And these are a few things I do to accomplish this, I hope it helps :)
---
\-hit 1,500 cap threshold every day on all characters (easy in mine near whitespring, takes about 10 min per character, very quick. Hard Bargain does help, same for Grape Mentats)
---
\-After hitting scrip cap, have 1-2-3 star legendaries with crap stats in your vendors for cheap. 75 caps 1 star, 125 caps 2 star, 200 for 3 star. 25 Caps less on each rank, for armor. It sells and it adds up, from people who don't have lots of time to play and just want their scrip cap daily. And if you have many weapons and armor in your vendor, people will come to your camp to shop, way more often, than if you only have 1-2 pieces of gear. Barely anyone will visit if you only have plans and ammo.
---
\-Bulk up Ammo like 5mm, 5.56, plasma carts, and .50 cals, don't sell 50 or 100 at a time, wait until you have a bulk amount. Sells much faster on Discord Channels. Same for junk like Acid, Plastic, Steel, Flux (Purple sells best) or Radiation Fluids. 
---
\-2 of my characters only use Fusion Cores for Ammo, others are Melee, so I run Lucky Hole Mines every day on them, with Excavator PA, and get lots of Lead. I buy bulk Acid from people on Discord and turn it all into 5.56 ammo. With Ammosmith and SuperDuper perks, I sell easily over 10,000 rounds every couple of days, when I find myself needing caps. Sometimes in my vendor for 1cap / round, sometimes on Discord for .5 / round.
---
My expenses are mostly Purple Flux, Prime .50 cal rounds. I also try to give a lot of stuff to low level players I find running around the world.
---
For those who only have 1 character leveled up, take advantage of double XP events, trust me, it pays off in the end. I am lucky, as I have a lot of time to play after work, in the evenings.
---
Hope this helps. Good hunting!
---
Nukesanddragons.com tells you exactly which perk to choose at every level.
---
Pick all the perks you want in your final build and hit enter.
---
You can earn more perk cards on you lvl 50, but you need to spend a point to reallocate points to different categories.
---
Pavlovian response I suppose. Get used to throwing money at a company in exchange for being lied to, and eventually one starts doing it even outside the context of the game.
---
Thanks , will keep that in mind!
---
Will look out for that
---
My worry with Wastelanders is that there will be very little story / quest content and will have a whole new slew of bugs whether they be game breaking or not we all know its going to happen.  However, I fear that it will mostly just be a whole new grind to obtain 4 and 5 star items with little to no significant content updates.  All the past DLC has pretty much just been new grind fests, a solid portion of which were broken at first.  Don't get me wrong, I'd love if I were wrong but the FO76 track record so far hasn't been the shiniest.
---
Alright nice , I mainly play solo . Don't have many active high level friends.

I still have my christmas tent.. i just tried.
---
You can learn the metal and combat armor helmets by scraping it BUT the only way to learn paint from both is from scraping their armor type. Metal armor for metal helmet and combat armor for combat helmet.
---
from what i have seen, the only food buffs that seem to stack are the healing from them +5 HP/s and similar, though i could be off. i'm not much of a food build person
---
calm down lol, i really dont care about this much, i just said, what i know. Playing since release date, i have almost 2000 hours ingame time, and i met probably 5 ppl who got ONE of those jumpsuit from the events.
---
thats why i said, what i said.
---
Because of poorly designed game..
---
Then don't act like you know what you're talking about if the facts say otherwise. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/c8hy58/all_jumpsuits_dropped_for_me_at_same_time_is_this/
---
Stupidity.
---
Now just to fire a quick mini nuke
---
I find West Tek to be the best place in the game to farm up Steel to craft Ammo, and Plastic to bulk junk. With Scrapper, 1 laser rifle gives 10 plastic. And there are a lot of them in there. As mentioned above, Black Water Mine is best, if you are going for vendor, as it's right outside.
---
Did the same a month ago.
---
sure, okay, whatever you want, just stop replying lol as i said, i do not care this much. 
---
kissez.
---
Yes everyone has that problem, lame limits in this game.
---
The present sucks. The future might be ok
---
As of know it is fixed.
---
If I honestly believed Bethesda could pull of what SE did with ARR, I'd happily download all over again.
---
But, ARR ended up with Yoshi-P in charge, whereas Fallout, Fallout never changes (hands).
---
Thanks! Sometimes when you miss you skip across the lake like a rock haha
---
Amazing job! I wish I was this creative lol.
---
Mutations are listed at the bottom. You'll see a part saying mutations, and if you tap the icon, it will tell you all the ones I have. The ideal armor for this build is vanguard/ ap refresh/better sneak. Vanguard can be subbed for mutant if they buff it in the balancing patch in the next few months. The ideal weapon is a meathook as it gets buffed from 1 handed, and unarmed perks, with anti armor, swing speed, and either 1 str, or weight reduction.
---
I'm no longer on ps4 unfortunately.
---
You can take a building with one piece of foundation and build out roof pieces and put walls in that way. As long as there's just one foundation piece it'll work.
---
This question has been asked about a dozen times over the past few days. The exploit has been fixed. 
---
Please use the search function to avoid duplicating questions and to save yourself some time.
---
Issue a refund to everyone who bought this game or subscribed to Fallout First. :)
---
Yeah, lol idk when that started, but rn turrets are just a waste of budget.
---

---
I've heard that It has been fixed and that It came back few days after fix, so I have no idea who to trust.
---
It's probably because loot is instanced per player involved in defeating that enemy. They can't exactly pull what *should* drop from what the enemy is using because that's going to change between players, and trying to force the drop to be whatever the enemy is using means everyone's just going to get the same thing.
---
Winter jacket makes you look like a homeless garbage man
---
I just play too much haha
---
I love new players I have my base by the overseer camp with artillery it’s always really funny to watch them run around in panic mode when the strikes land! No damage of course but funny as hell
---
We've had something similar in nw too.
---
If you have access to a private server, just take the workshops in the forest. Each event gives around 25% xp in early levels, lots of scorched for ammo, and low level legendaries from leader of the pack.
---
Just doing nothing but farming scorched for gifts, and doing workshop events, I took a character from 1-20+ in around a day.
---
I fucking hate gaming journalism, it is the worst thing to happen to gaming in years, so many people take the literal shit that comes from their mouths as gospel, it ruins games and studios. People will protest games and tell everyone its terrible without ever touching them just because joe blow over at PCGaming said it was shit.
---
That would be very handy. I would check the “bug forecast” every day at work to plan how to play around them later on. “Food and drink meters depleting faster right now, guess I’ll cook a bunch of stuff before questing” etc
---
50caps max selling to vendor :)
---
I do this for 31caps each max
---
Its getting thrown around because there is a ton of legit hacking going on right now.
---
They must have put some kind of (client) security around the console otherwise it would be a uninterrupted shitfest. Hackers are probably looking at what data is sent to the server and sending they own taylored requests, which requires some experience.
---
I think he used it right as he seems to be concerned that the low level was attacking him drom a distance (like NW hackers do when they shoot through buildings or whatever).
---
A ton huh? I know of two?
---
lol 😂🤣😁
---
I wish the whole community would temper their expectations like you have. I don't think it is going to be near as revolutionary of an expansion as people think.
---
Oh, the Boy Scouts in power armor have shown up.  Hello play soldiers.
---
PVP in fallout 76 all comes down to who bought the most sentinel assasins gear and explosive legacy weapons on eBay.
---
I couldn’t agree more; I would extend that sentiment to more than just those two outlets however (Eurogamer seems to be competing on that front, for example). We need a modern day “Fairness Doctrine” across all reporting media, only one that doesn’t require presenting contrasting viewpoints where none should exist but rather a responsibility of truth in reporting.
---
Has anyone created a thread that gets updated of all known and currently working hacks so people have a place to go and stay updated on all of these?
---
PA is for pussies like the BoS.  Real Enclave members are rocking scout armor.
---
When? I mention discussions in the community around Bethesda pursuing legal action against the hack creator (ErectBan), but in the very next sentence how I am not a lawyer and not going to pretend to know the potential of that. Here is a direct link: https://youtu.be/D_VZx5Vj7s8?t=501
---
When did I talk about people going after Bethesda with lawsuits over losing digital items? I don't think I ever did
---
After a while of searching when I saw the original post I found out it's purpose.  
---
 [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Lockdown](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Lockdown)   
---
It's part of a cut quest.
---
The biggest budget eaters are billboards&gt;turrets&gt;crops&gt;foundations/roofing&gt;lighting/conduits&gt;everything else. If you’re camp has been built for a while, try moving it then moving it back and placing the blueprint back down as some weights may have been changed since building and will adjust themselves. Consider using a floating camp since you can use only 1 foundation piece and, if possible, have stairs on to your rooftop so you can use upper flooring instead of roofing tiles.
---
I haven't heard or read that it came back. Was this posted somewhere here?
---
Im just calling that genius
---
My post wasn't about defending Bethesda. It was about calling out misinformation and the terrible practice of redding sourcing by games writers. And I'm calling out major publications that are under corporate ownership (Polygon is owned by Vox and Kotaku is owned by Gizmodo), so it's pretty sad that you act like this is corporate shilling when I'm actively criticizing corporate entities.
---
Please wake up and emerge from your Bethesda vs. The World dichotomy. There's more going on than you're comprehending.
---
weird fact: Whitesprings is part of the Forest in that map.
---
Not sure what system you are on. I'm on PC and would be a bullet sponge for a little bit if you were on at the same time.
---
Events definitely help with leveling up early on as they tend to give 200 or more xp.  Easy ones for solo play early on besides fertile soil would be death blossoms, back on the beat, leader of the pack, path to enlightenment, and feed the people. All in the forest.  Only 2 of these are a public event that gives a notification, so you'll have to go to the map and see what is active.  
---
Check out events in the ash heap and toxic valley depending on your level you can solo them, or if you see other people at them join up, tag stuff and let them finish it off. Or just stay in the area until they finish it and you'll get the xp for event completion. It's cheesy but it's xp lol.
---
It's a pretty stupid thought but thanks for sharing.
---
You’re stuck on some BS because you’re gullible. It’s patched. You can’t take from people, only give.
---
I was wondering the same. Say if they have another event like this next year, and quite likely the loot pool will be expanded by then, if I save my gifts and open them next Christmas, will I have a chance to get new loots, or are the gifts tied to the loot pool of this year? I’d sure love to get some different mounted stuff since I already have them all.
---
I like to cook mothman eggs, I can sell them for about 540 if I remember correclty by looting them in the town in the forest. Very good place to visit during the holiday event since I go there primarly for the santa scorched but the eggs are a nice bonus.
---
Find the dome structure with the female statue near the Whitespring tennis courts. Under the dome is a water well that is grated. On the wall of that structure is one working water fountain that delivers healing sulfur water from the site's famous spring. Drink from that water fountain and your infections will be cured. It won't make you any younger, not that I've discovered yet, but it will treat all those nasty wasteland diseases.
---
I usually hit my 1400 per day cap limit in 10mins. I just do Uranium Fever, whip out my gatling laser / 50 cal and go to town. Loot all the dead bodies for everything. Then equip super duper, cook all the glowing meat to glowing meat steaks, easy 200-300 caps right there alone. Sell all uneeded junk / weapons then if there's left overs equip scrapper and get a ton of steel off the weapons.
---
That would happen in Fallout 4. Sounds cool, just wait until you get locked into a stable and cripple animation loop from one with an explosive mini gun.
---
lots of words to say "Lying about people I don't like is ok"
---
Like so many others, you completely fail to comprehend the purpose of the post. It's about games media and accurate representation, which would include talking about Bethesda's actual fails in an honest way. 
---
Sorry about your crap circumstances but that has nothing to do with my post.
---
Nobody claimed it does. Too many Bethesda haters on here failing to understand what I wrote and why.
---
Have seen it here and on one discord, but there are so much rumors lately I'm no 100% sure if that's true. So don't trust me too, just saying what I've heard.
---
Happy holidays says Frosty. Congratulations you are a true wasteland winner.
---
Thank you for 100% understanding my position and points.
---
The paddleball is great to use against griefers while in pacifist mode. When ever some is rude, I just step out of my power armor in my mr. Fuzzy outfit and arm myself with the paddle ball. I carry about 200 strings so i can keep playing with it for a long time.
---
I completely agree. I want this too
---
Spotted the tinfoil hat collector who doesn't understand the purpose of this thread... at all.
---
i'm not jelly, you're jelly....
---
srsly tho congrats!
---
Yea maybe we should all just use dishonesty and misleading information to 'get even' with things we dislike. Eventually society will be a web of lies because everyone hates something, but hey, it's not like empiricism and objectivity have created anything good in the last 100 years... right?
---
It's not just games either.  It's EVERYTHING. For example, I love marvel and star wars, so I get a lot of rumors in my Google feed. 9/10 are sourced from Reddit. Many of the threads sourced aren't even popular! One or two comments and heavily downvoted.
---
This is a larger lesson for life guys, 90% of what you read online is sheer opinion. Fake facts aren't just for 'real' news.
---
hahahaha
---
Prepare to be banned like I'm preparing for the downvoted for posting this.
---
Joke’s ok you, Bethesda does that ~weekly.
---
From what I have read and understand the ability to steal from players has been patched but people can PUT stuff into your inventory. I have not seen any reports of things being stolen since the patch.
---
I wish they sold cheap "clutter" bundles in the atom shop. Something like 50 atoms, unlocks things like table settings, junk on shelves, sandbags, etc. Some way to make things look more lived in.
---
Also add mannequins that we can use to display rare outfits.
---
r/Fallout is an awful sub now unfortunately but even journalists who use Reddit as a source know to avoid that garbage
---
TBH, when I looked to see how much it was to get the full outfit, I legit googled "how to dupe Mr Fuzzy tokens xbox". LOL
---
I'm still grinding though. I'll get them eventually. :)
---
All of us know this place is a shithole.
---
Anyone who looks for something valuable in an outhouse is probably a shitty person.
---
There's a hack that increases melee distance and speed so it's possible it could have been
---
Yes!!! Exactly 
---
If they sold them as bundle single items I bet that would help with camp budget too rather than us putting each item on a shelf
---
Number of sales made on the game, also I said even if they only had 100k which is very reasonable.
---
wtf why are you downvoting me pff
---
Good to know. Sorry for misleading, then.
---
Could you offer a console copy of the game to people who bought the PC version? Pretty annoying/makes me jealous to hear how PS4 and XB1 players have no idea about these hacking issues. Would be nice to have that experience.
---
Also, let’s be real Beth, the hacks are gonna get worse and worse until playing the game means players risk losing their identity. PC isn’t safe.
---
I will take a PS4 copy, please. I’ll also take PSN subscriptions since I bought PC version to avoid paying subscription to play online. Thanks!
---
Oh you're fine. I myself am struggling to filter through all of the posts lately to stay up to date on correct information. I wish there was an official thread with all known and working hacks so players had an official source for said information.
---
MrDoctorTerrano. Returning player, nephew got the game for Christmas and redownloaded. Haven’t played since launch and I think I’m somewhere in the 20s. Don’t know what much has changed or what builds are viable but any help is appreciated!
---
Oh ok lol
---
As a DJ I love it!  Pose checks out lol.
---
Bunch of filthy deserters.  The Enclave is the official Government and army of the US.
---
No, I haven't - there's a lot of stuff that's SUPPOSED to work, but absolutely does not in 76. Hence my skepticism. I still doubt this, even though you have a "copy and paste" answer. 
---
Also a guide some guy wrote a year ago (which is probably largely based on fallout 4 knowledge) is not a credible source of information of the current state of 76.
---
If running only 1 account you need someone to help hold the tokens as you swap characters. Don't try to drop and re-log in, I have seen too many players lose items that way...always go through a secondary that you have friended to allow coming back to the same server.  I run two accounts on PC which make it easier, 10 characters total and get 30 tokens per day. 8 of my characters are at level 20 due to only doing camden park. I went this route as I accidentally scrapped my mr fuzzy head and wanted to replace in less then 1/2 a year, and in 30 days I have enough tokens for two full sets (or multiple paddleballs)
---
Welch isn’t bad either. Good amount of mole miners, one or 2 with rocket launchers as well. Plus super mutants also spawn at the southern part of town and usually carry laser weapons among other guns. To top it off you have a train station/vendor right there to instantly drop it all off.   
---
I also used it to farm miner suit scrap for black titanium.
---
I think thats because they use more weapons than any other enemys (they can use more melee weapons and more pipe weapons than the super mutants for exemple), so since what they drop seems to be randomized, they have an higher chance of dropping something differant than what they are fighting with. That should be something similar with the new human NPCs that are coming with Wastelanders.
---
The more options the better. There are some very creative players out there. I love seeing items used in ways I never thought of.
---
To be fair. There's no way for any company to know how many people were actually affected by bug and hack abuse. 
---
The only way for them to possibly know is to be able to physically monitor every players active movements and actions in real time by watching them play the game.
---
I just love how responsive to the problems Bethesda is getting. Thats pretty late for sure, but hell, better late than never !
---
This is probably the most useful thing I have ever read thank you
---
Just look out for the rads
---
I used to get super excited about the DLC in this game but I was going off the expectations from past Bethesda DLC's that were actually beefy.  But I kept having my hopes and dreams shattered by waiting impatiently for months for the DLC to drop and getting all of 15 minutes of enjoyment out of them before uttering the phrase "Ok, now what?" Which has become the norm for all the FO76 DLC so far.  I've tempered my expectations because I was forced to unfortunately :(
---
Can't do that. You're legally not allowed to sue if there's a defect in the game that they address and fix. 
---
Only if they refuse to fix it are you allowed to.
---
Nice list, but that's op, not neccesary Uny, etc...
---
It's really easy to get max buy/sell prices son:
---
3 CH POINTS + 3 HARD BARGAIN + SHIELDED CASUAL + GRAPE MENTATS  + ANY BEER
---
That is. Max buy/sell prices.
---
Hard Bargain needs char gets level 7, 8 or 9 to be maxed.
---
Shielded casual, must be passed or bought (1K-2K in vendors).
---
btw, Sweet Rolls can replace the +3CH of the casual underarmor. Four Sweet Rolls spawn in a box, in the porch in front of the Red Rocket next to the Purveyor's TS.
---
I can usually make the full 1400 after Uranium Fever, looting every enemy and walking to WS Station while encumbered.  If I can cook the glowing meat, the price jumps to 11c each.
---
I run unyielding armor, which gives me 19cha, plus three rank hard bargain.  I’m pretty sure that maxes out sale price value, because eating grape mentats or alcohol doesn’t lower prices any further.
---
I hope there was. Same for the Excavator PA. I mean its a Power Armor made for excavation, why is there no powerful lamps attached to it...
---
You're very welcome. Glad I could help, at least one person lol
---
Grenade launchers are not that bad
---
And endless disease haha
---
Could have been someone using OPK and a weapon script on you on their alternate account. OPK to keep you in front of them and the weapon script to make their punches “rapid fire” to annoy the shit out of you
---
Sweet. I’m not too big on builds since I have used the same one for 100 levels but I’m sure I can help you out on one if you need it. I’m out now m, but I’ll be home in an hour or 2 if your are on. I’ll friend you now from my Xbox app
---
haha nice!
---
Sounds good I’m at work but I’ll be playing tonight! Appreciate the help
---
You don't get banned for that sort of thing. People accidentally end up where they shouldn't with regularity. If you got banned for this there'd be a ton of people who got banned around the time the sheepsquatch was released because traveling to the sheepsquatch hoard event was putting people inside one of the vaults.
---
Have you run into the folks with the mini guns that shoot nuclear missiles in adventure mode yet?
---
Nine out of ten times my loot from the SBQ is a useless melee weapon although I don’t use melee at all. Just received two identical pool cues from two SBQ battles back to back. Maybe i need to start a new toon and see if the instance improves? 🤮
---
Exactly!
---
probably just people brigading after the latest youtube "hit videos" that are full of incorrect info, again.
---
Can you at least agree that Bethesda needs to do more if this game is going to last? I love fallout with a passion but fallout 76 is not a good game in it's current state.
---
lol that's elaborate
---
great music and editing, too!
---
Would be nice since it could reduce the ring of fire damage as well
---
Hahahahah wow gj bethesda.  Keep up the good work.
---
yeah it would be nice, i run shotguns which imo should counter launchers, but with everyone doing that fucking invincible from explosion exploit. i get gunned down by someone using an auto launcher point blank.
---
The last I knew weapons like that were removed from the game so I have not heard any recent reports.
---
They are. You can glitch it so you're immune to your own explosive damage, and jump, firing at your feet. This isn't working as intended. 
---
I wouldn't have an issue with them, if every 4th person you fight didn't have one. They're **entirely** too common in game. At the final circle, there are squads all running one, you can deal with 1, you can't deal with 4-8 simultaneous explosions.
---
The game can be trash sometimes but its fun
---
Yeah, that's where I see most of it. I still don't understand how it's so excruciatingly toxic though.
---
A lot of folks won’t go to them if no one else there. So start it and see if folks show up.
---
Yes it is. there is quite a few mods that are a Quality of life mod.
---
perk load out is one of them.
---
Great gift! 
---
For some reason it makes me want a quantum cola lava lamp...
---
Awesome!!
---
I tried to get him for my nye party, but he was already booked, DJ snallgaster just isn’t the same, so much snot ear.
---
That’s pretty good
---
If you get one month and don't renew you are only allowed to take the stuff you put in the scrapbox out of it.
---
This is it exactly. I'm running full shotgun as well, and constantly get shot point blank in the face, and they take no damage.
---
I like this option, because you get them as a side effect. Zero extra effort if you are looking ghouls for legendaries, collecting the damn uniforms, farming BF or decent junk...
---
I would love to see a bunch of perks reworked along with legendary effects.   I hate power creep because it seems to make all the hours spent grinding for gear mean nothing. Heres a good start:
---
Nocturnal=no daytime penalty and 50 pct boost at night.
---
Hunters/Bug/mutant slayer/scorched/ghouls slayer/troubleshooter/etc should all be combined under the same effect called Creature Slayer. Boosted to 40 pct damage.
---
Mutants=7pct boost per mutation capped at 5 mutations. 
---
Medic and vampire should be combined. Health regen per shot and team health regen on vats criticals.
---
Assasins=35 pct boost against humans and players.
---
Explosive should be a major prefix. Then it can be specced for explosive builds.
---
Unlimited magazine on semi auto pistols and heavy launcher weapons with slow fire rate. Makes these more viable.
---
Cryo, fire, acid, bleed, poison should be modules you can add with legendary mods adding 4th star to any weapon.
---
Stalkers=only on ranged weapons. Gives same boost plus 15pct increased damage per shot while meeting requirements.
---
I hate the level scaling in this game, I’m i think level 78 and I still get my ass whooped by level 68 scorched. Kind of takes the fun away when the only way to kill enemies is by having legendary weapons, which I am not so lucky at getting. I don’t play or know as much about the game as most of you on this subreddit though so I probably got a Shiite build
---
I even wrote in my OP that Bethesda should be called out when they do wrongs, so yes, I agree they need to do more (or at least do certain things better). 
---
That said, misinformation and crappy reddit sourcing from mainstream media is not going to help this game get better. No fire will be lit under Bethesda's ass. It's only going to make things worse.
---
As far as 76 not being a good game right now, that's entirely subjective and up to the individual. If you have fun with a game, then it's a good game for you.
---
I mean it IS Reddit
---
Very cool!!
---
I agree wholeheartedly with your last statement. I am incredibly envious of the people who still play the game and have fun in it. I want to but I see too many issues personally that ruin it for me.
---
So question for you what's your opinion on juice heads videos?
---
I want the ones in the holiday tents, that would be awesome.
---
You are expecting _this_ subreddit to call out people who misrepresent issues in the game?  
---
The same subreddit that accuses anyone of saying positive things about the game as being a paid Bethesda shill?
---
The same subreddit that is filled with toxic posts for days at a time attacking anyone who dares to enjoy the game contrary to other posters assertions that the game is unplayable and that anyone playing it is lying?
---
The same subreddit that spreads all sorts of incorrect information about aspects of the game and downvotes people who try to point out and correct them? 
---
Ie:  “10 star legendaries”, “fallout first private servers are peer to peer and Bethesda is forcing you to pay for using your own computer as a server”, the hundreds of “I got banned for no reason!” that always end up being the OP was a duper shitbag or running CheatEngine claiming to be ‘researching’ some random excuse.
---
The only subreddit more rabidly anti Fallout 76 then r/fo76 is r/fallout.  These bullshit news articles are just towing the line that people here want them to tow.
---
I mean the lighthouse, soup factory and farmhand events are easy to do and net a decent reward. Maybe just stick with those?
---
Once a guy gave me this for about 5k, i sold the whole set for about 7k. Never been so disappointed in myself, the way the guy i dokd it to reacted just told me I messed up. Damn you early days!!!
---
Hello, fellow Canadian!
---
I hit lvl 50 just in the Forest, Toxic Valley, and Whitesprings...
---
This game deserves every bit of critism it gets.
---
Its never a good argument to include one particular issue with a array of other problems you think that will lead to. Let me give you some life pro tip advice "Everything is situational"
---
I said I don't side with gaming journalism really at all because its either click bate or just flat out misleading/agenda driven and I would fight bad journalism in a heart beat on a topic I cared about. But not this because I simply do not give a shit about a companys image that treats people badly.
---
Social media = toxic hate.
---
You can also craft blueprints from the edit menu in your camp.
---
They're really nice, have one myself! They're a little pricy though, but a very cool display item. Goes very nice with my 2 fallout walls!
---
Oh ok. That sounds right because I remember it had something to do with scorched. I was telling a friend that you used to be able to rank up legendaries but he didn't think I was remembering it right. Thanks.
---
I'm not disagreeing with that fact, but I am simply pointing out that if this company didn't release a defective product, that exploit wouldn't even be possible.  I don't know why you can't understand this?  It's almost as if- you are saying; well they (Bethesda) screwed up, but that's OK, the real problem here is these guys.  All I'm saying is, look at the source of the problem, without Bethesda's poorly coded game, none of this could/would have happened.
---
Turrets are working for me as of about 20 mins ago. I don’t have missile launchers tho.
---
Bethesda did confirm that they're working on a budget increase, but they stated that in the context of the Fallout 1st subscription. So it's likely subbers will either be the only ones to get the increase, or they'll get more increase. 
---
It's a bit frustrating and I really wish everyone could build a big camp, but it's also understandable that making public server performance worse isn't a good thing-- and rather unfair to those who don't care about camp building.
---
Anyway, my guess is that the increase will happen some time either right before Wastelanders, or alongside its release.
---
I think you just sold me on the (Not So) Giant Letters.
---
I'd be happy with any type of mitigation, *anything* to help balance it.
---
Wow great set up👍
---
Yep, happens everytime.
---
Fallout 76 has sold over 13 million copys $$$ and gets money from Atom sales $$$... When GTAV launched they didn't have a cystalball to tell them how well it would do with MTX's but they still included the Invite only option you cannot really defend Bethesda for Fallout1st which is a money grab plain and simple...
---
the problem worsens if your similar to me and run scrounger as well, on xbox i can feed our 1 normal grenadier 40-60+ grenades a game just from that perk alone.
---
 Bethesda needs to release prebuilt homes. These should theoretically free up more space and allow us to use more budget on decorations and defenses.  All you would really need to do is drop down a 3x3 foundation base and put the building down. Maybe have them pre-wired so you just connect a generator out side and you are set.
---
I would love one of those 2 story houses or even a barn structure.  Just make them empty so I can fill it with all my cool loot.
---
Basically we wouldn't be getring more budget but you should have less used up on the actual structure leaving more available for cosmetics.
---
Heads up, if you revive a friend in water it counts for the swimming badge (fairly easy to do) and the scout values at the same time. The place you go for the swimming test has mirelurks in knee deep water, so you can easily let yourself and your friend get downed then get them up there while grouping your tasks.
---
The three badges I suggest looking at are Athletics, Swimming, and Archery. Really simple challenges.
---
Right, thanks for confirming what I already wrote. Ideology &gt; accuracy for you.
---
Chris Bratt and his co-workers, formerly Eurogamer now over on People Make Games on YouTube are a gem. If you want to go immediately off the deep end with them: https://youtu.be/EgNXJQ88lfk

awesome

---
Some ppl cant comprehend that others enjoy things they dont like or even care to try. Therefore they feel entitled to attack playerbase because of this percieved personal insult.
---
Meanwhile i cant understand wasting one second hating on a game i dislike, but some are irrational and think they are being edgy or cool coming on here with burner accounts i guess.
---
Like their opinion is going to stop me from enjoying a game lol.
---
many events are actually solo-able.
---
I am lower level and usually wait to see who goes.  If a group of lev 200's just go it can be really expensive as a lev 30 so I won't go on a lot of the events .. so it is good advise TNJulz gave .. go and see if anyone shows.. also if you have done an event before I like to show up late... I still get the reward and boss fight but don't have to expend so many resources.
---
HA!
---
All "news" needs to specify opinions and entertainment versus unbiased reports.  This is getting out of hand on all fronts..
---
love it, reminds me of the time i decided to fill up a workshop budget with flashing lights in a big square room expecting people to be blinded, instead they gathered under the disco ball jumping around.
---
Maybe it's the anonymity that makes them show their true colors.
---
Yeah it's a problem, but I don't see anything in your recent post history calling out Bethesda for any blatant lies or "misrepresentations" on their part. So it's pretty wild you'll write an essay on critiquing something we all know to be true. And even your examples are nothing egregious on the journalists part. 
---
The timing of your post really feels like a case of "Yeah I shit the bed, but jimmy didn't brush his teeth". Fallout 76 isn't that bad, people just lie and are mean.
---
I saw it in game last week, Absolutely was after the "removal" patch.
---
You're missing the hidden third option here, bud. Not reporting anything at all considering you only have insufficient proof. If you don't have enough solid proof to convict a person of murder in a court case, the case is either dropped or at the very least set to reconvene.
---
But the point with this psudo-journalism is that they don't have solid proof of most of these claims. They don't play the game. Yet, they spout their subjective fallacies based off someone else's hearsay and conjecture. Sure there are REAL problems with this game. More than there reasonably should be, Bethesda, but they are often misrepresented and/or overblown for an increased impact. 
---
It's dirty journalism. And the blind masses eat it up as if it was a news article. They are willing to take a blog for fact out of complacency, laziness or some other stupid modern human vice. Blogs have become synonymous with news. A fact that is unfortunate, but no less true.
---
Turrets are a waste of budget tbh, just build punji sticks they'll be about as useful
---
Looks like a good spot, will have to try it out.  Does anyone know a way to farm for High Radiation Fluids, Glowing Mass, &amp; Hardened Mass?   Getting the raw flux never seems to be a problem for me, finding the other ingredients needed to make serums though, always a prob for me.
---
Groupthink
---
Makes sense. I'll give that a whirl. Thank you!
---
Invincible from explosion exploit?
---
There are a lot of people on this sub from certain other, Fallout subs, that have had a hate boner for this game since it launched. "It's not a real Fallout game", and all that petty BS.
---
Theres a thing called a search bar
---
Exactly this!   Sometimes you can get the free travel to the revised Events, and then wait to activate the trigger to see if more folks come.
---
Toxins have proven to be a serious post war threat to humanity. Only a communist wouldn't hate them.
---
I feel where you're coming from but I have to disagree with one thing. You're treating the subreddit as a singular entity when you write things like "the same subreddit that accuses anyone saying positive things as being a paid Bethesda shill". But it's not the subreddit that's saying that, it's particular individuals. I mean in this thread there's at least one person calling me a shill, probably many more (don't have time to read every response), but the thread itself has over 1k upvotes now so clearly lots of people care about accuracy when it comes to the game.
---
I think this subreddit just gets pulled in both directions. Sometimes it's quite positive, sometimes it's quite negative. There are always bad actors who are only here to crap on 76 and to troll positive posters, so I'm not saying your experiences aren't real... I just think you're extrapolating too much from them. 
---
Just my two cents though.
---
I think it’s because people who love Fallout REALLY love it, and so we take everything to heart and are over dramatic about it. Some folks are hopeful and supportive of Bethesda in the long run, others are spiteful, angry and resentful. 
---
Then enter all the Youtubers whisper-yelling who see a topic they can instigate easily, and they take advantage of it.
---
What?
---
While you might think the intentional destruction of private property is  an acceptable amount of vigilante justice in retaliation for the loss of virtual items, you wont find a court that agrees with you.
---
its a big problem on xbox right now, im not gonna explain how to do it but it takes under 10 seconds to trigger with a teammate nearby
---
Shut up and take my upvote.
---
You on xbox?  I wouldnt mind spending 15 minutes with ya to help tweak your build.  I wont be home till sunday though.
---
Im surprised you're not getting more downvotes. Someone published something unsubstantiated and through time has been proven to be false. Doesn't matter. "He's Fucking Guilty". I dont like Trump either but sheesh so many people are living in la la land. Please you guys who have been consumed by this faaaarrr left clickbait nonsense outrage recover your critical thinking skills. The bias in media has everyone hating each other while the parent companies just keep getting richer.
---
What platform you on?
---
I usually start them solo and others 9 times out of 10 turn up. But their usually easy to do alone.
---
I wish they had a Join Random Team option on the main menu. I like to just be a silent NPC-like companion for newbies - follow them around and put down anything that gives them any grief. Xbox's LFG is great for most games, but for FO76 the feature is used mostly for trading. I try to do this for strangers I come across in-game, but because fast travel is so prevalent, they constantly disappear. And I'm not on Discord. The Join Posse option is perfect in Red Dead Online, I wish they had something similar in FO76. For now, I'll just stick to waiting outside Vault 76 when I see a Lvl 1 lingering there.
---
Actually this sub one of the most positive and peaceful on Reddit. Go check RDR or Borderlands subs for example
---
Your whiny thread complaining about "reporters" who don't like the game won't change anything... at all.
---
There are a lot of threads like this.
---
If you don't like how any of those sites are reporting about the game..... guess what, simply don't read the damn articles. Problem solved. 
---
But I understand, whiny internet heroes always have to complain on imageboards about everything.
---
Sadly these last two rewards are droppable. Nice for others maybe. Sucked with that last 21000 exp grind.
---
My opinion of Juicehead goes up and down. Sometimes I think he's being fair, sometimes it feels like he's sensationalizing just like many other youtubers.
---
In the end I would guess he's someone who genuinely likes the game and wants it to succeed. But I don't think his representation of the game is always fair. I also think he's in a weird place because a lot of the people commenting on his videos are clearly anti-Bethesda and anti-76... so I suspect he has to straddle a line to avoid losing subscribers on both sides.
---
I know it wont but it needs,addressing.
---
It was fixed a few days ago.  The hack was only active for less than 24 hours.
---
My sister got me one as well!
---
I really love the fallout and elder scrolls games but. I know there will be issues that an offline game company experiences when they make a single player game to a multiplayer game.
---
Awesome. Please tell me Crashed Santa is on his other side of the wall!
---
Bethesda deserves a lot of it.
---
No one cares when some random stranger is acting like an asshole. When your best friend is acting like an asshole you get upset.
---
Cool I'm Useraffel looking for new friends
---
Well everytime I'm here it seems soo toxic.
---
If you don't like how I'm delivering my opinions about games reporters... guess what, simply don't read my damn thread. Problem solved.
---
(see how effective that is?? Let's silence the world together ROYYYY!)
---
&gt;not that bad
---
im curious to know the reasoning behind an autolauncher being used at point blank range with explosive immunity is "not that bad"
---
Make sure you document and report stuff like that when you see it.
---
No they dont.
---
They deserve criticism but not toxic hate. 
---
When they receive toxic hate they'll just flat out ignore it as what it is.
---
yeah i stored them all about hour ago and redid and seem to be working
---
Thanks for missing the point. I even edited the post to clarify but I guess some people can't be helped. xD
---
Nice thanks for sharing! How did you manage to end up there exactly?
---
April isn’t in Q1
---
True, there is a blurring of lines. Which has probably always been a problem, but since social media has really solidified and become a major source of revenue in the last decade (for both individuals and corporations), it seems to be getting worse.
---
This post reminds me of one of my favorite movie quotes. 
---
"Some people just want to watch the world burn."
---
Hes who I follow for fo76 news at this point (yongyea and legacy kinda but they're definitely biased) I think hes as unbiased a news source as there is at this point for fo76 not to mention his other videos are always informative. That being said he had had a few sensationalist videos but I've also noticed that In comparison to the YouTube stated above on related videos, juice head is very objective on it, while the other two get quite emotional about it, which I get but that's not what I'm looking for. It pains me to see people going to the likes of kotaku and polygon for news on games tho lol hard to believe people still do that
---
Pretty sure
---
I havent read your posting because the headline already told me all I needed to know.
---
You are basically just wasting your precious time by replying since I am clearly an alt acc for trolling. Mhh.
---
Yup. When I was low level I would snipe the baddies and run to the bots for protection, lol
---
I went on and off a couple of times, restarted the game too. Not a problem, at least for me.
---
Yeah it stacks
---
Certain people hate on anyone who doesn’t agree with them.  And it’s not just on Reddit.  Look at the House of Representatives.  Some people simply can’t accept losing or being shunned by the majority.  So they act out.
---
You need to read, I never confirmed what you wrote. I just explained it was ignorant in a nice way.  Just remember "Everything is situational".
---
Good to hear 👍
---
This is awesome.... Very creative ...... Top build .... Any chance you're on PS4 ???? I wanna take a ride
---
Mmk. My time isn't precious though, it's the holiday expandable type.
---
Let's avoid politics. Don't want to bring a whole different level of toxicity from either side.
---
It does.
---
Same here wven with just hard bargain its 28caps for me so i only use grape mentats if i have them.
---
It ebbs and flows with BGS screwups, both real and perceived. It's actually much better now than launch and also when 1st came out.
---
What is this?  Kill the Mega Sloth in the Bog?
---
Someone once told me that if you team, and have one player in the Bog and one player shooting at the Sloth at Tanagra Town, you'd get credit for killing it in the Bog.
---
So you, someone who tried and failed at being a games blogger, assume that everyone else has the same lax professional standards as you? You've never worked in journalism or at a professional outlet and in fact did the opposite of what they do and failed at it, and you say that experience gives you an understanding of what they do. Okay, sure buddy. I fucked up installed a new bath spout once, now let me tell you how all plumbers do shoddy work.
---
What's the point of a flair then
---
The other night, I was roaming the wastes visiting player camps; and when I went back to my own camp to get ready to log off, I found there were 3 higher level(120+) players hanging around my vendors, 2 of them were crouched down, I thought okay, and shot a greeting wave anyway. As soon as I waved, one of the players with a Gatling plasma runs over and bashes me for no reason, and then the others proceeded to begin shooting up my camp. I've had this happen before, instead of returning the attack, I just logged off the world and ended their assault on my camp, with the loss of one single wall. It's hardly worth my time to waste the resources I've collected to rebuild my camp to for the amusement of people that choose to engage this way. 
---
The question I still have is, what's the point of sitting there wasting your time at someone's camp just to ambush them when/IF they return? I could've easily just logged out elsewhere in the world, and not went back to camp. The whole idea of this seems like a silly waste of three people's time.
---
&gt;Geoff Keely
---
Did you mean Geoff Keighley, the guy who literally runs a sponsored awards show for the video games industry and who is not only not a journalist but whose pay check and entire incentive structure is about NOT being critical of games and the games industry? 
---
He is... not a good example.
---
I mean, your post was bad and totally uninformed and ignorant and all the rest, but I thank you for properly using "biased" instead of "bias" like many idiots do.
---
It does’nt.
---
I just know that politics is so much more divided in hate regardless who you agree with. So I didn't want to invite that Avenue in here. 
---
I get it though. It's such a shame.
---
Glad that my sarcastic post elicited the same response I had reading yours.
---
What toxic hate are you referring too exactly?
---
Post a vid!
---
I think a lot of it stems from us paying full price for a game we were told was going to be the best fallout ever and we’ve been trying our damndest to play it ever since but Bethesda keeps making it as difficult as possible to not throw your Xbox through your tv when something new stops working every single week
---
Really?? I'd like to try this out and see if it works.
---
Honestly I think a bit of this is related to Bethesda putting out buggy games, and people feeling FO76 was their comeuppance on that, and feeling the need to drill that home every chance they can.  To an extent I can get that.  There’s little evidence that Bethesda has learned that lesson, and I can get wanting Bethesda to learn that lesson before their next release.
---
I’ve played plenty of games over the years, active on the message boards and the like.  When I quit, I left those boards.  I don’t get hanging out on a board of a game you don’t play.  Perhaps my time is more valuable than others’...
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
Let me know, if I still have a few I’d be happy to give them to you.
---
I mean, you have to understand: the people in this thread have zero media literacy. They don't understand the difference between Buzzfeed media and Buzzfeed News. They use words like "bias" without understanding anything at all about what they're saying. They make broad sweeping statements about "the media" when they're actually talking about a YouTuber they don't like. Nuanced points like yours aren't going to fly.
---
Lucky! I'm so bummed I haven't ran into Mothman. :P
---
I've been following this sub and just following the random things I see. Somehow I started the game by going right into super mutant territory, whoops. Somehow I survived! My wife gifted me this game last year and I freaking love it, honestly, despite all the bugs/reviews/quirks. I love getting silly or strange screenshots, too. Last one was a stuffed bear that seemed to be robbing another bear...
---
Literally anyone can say "this shit sucks," which is why cynicism like yours can always be immediately dismissed as ignorance.
---
Iv always for this game to be very similar to gta online as far as game structure works
---
Yes, medicine, definitely free from the influence of money and politics. Especially in the United States.
---
Considering that you're looking at them performing a new game based on their old game and they told people that everyone this was an experimental game for them that there will be some unexpected errors. 
---
Many of these wouldn't show up in a single player version
---
I know Steam drop the banhammer on people for doing this but the Bethesda launcher is a long way from Steam
---
This
---
I sent you a friend request. My username is orcaman20206
---
gj, all the more so given the tools you’re workin with. smooth music too
---
But they told everyone that its experimental from the start. No one who bought it should be surprised if they did even the slightest research.
---
The clearly visible hate that is seen on many posts. 
---
Especially those that deal with newly found bugs.
---
I've never tried it myself, this is just what I've heard and I don't know the specifics (like, if you have to tag it, then jump to the bog.  Or if the person who does the kill gets credit too).
---
Back out before they ban you 😂
---
Yes replacing a canvas bag with a nylon bag is exactly the same as mass murder.
---
I do. I usually keep them in my vendor for 3.5k a pop. I'll be on in a bit. I have to go to the weed store today lol.
---
Make sure you equip Hard Bargin if you can. Its under Charisma
---
I dunno, I can see your insult pretty well.
---
It’s most of the gaming subs I frequent.  It ranges from toxic players to hardcore daily players with thousands of hours telling people not to buy the game and praying for the demise of the game.
---
I think it’s just people taking out their IRL stress on their keyboard.
---
Just north of the bear on bottom of map
---
Lifegiver perk and emergency protocol is a must on PA bloodied build.
---
Extremely ironic, but whats situational is just the topic. Its got nothing to do with the opinion or decision. 
---
When "you" let your personal philosophy/opinion decide that because 76 is being shit on by a journalist become your ideal that everyone will become liars then that is a "personal philosophy" and a tinfoil hat one at that. But knowing my motto stinks to you then It just proves itself.
---
Every fucking engine is wide open for exploits.
---
There are "Beth haters" for many, many reasons.
---
And he is referring to people not reporting accurate information. Can you not fucking read?
---
You're right, forget Bethesda breaking their game on a weekly basis to the point journalists cant keep up. The problem is that consumers are being manipulated into thinking F76 is a broken game when it's only broken half as much as described.
---
Sterling said it yesterday, writing pieces on F76 is an overused meme to the point of him saying their a meme has become a meme.
---
No. It's been over a year.
---
The counterpoint to your post would be, why are people blindly defending Bethesda all the time? Would you blindly defend them if 1,800 hours of your time was suddenly removed from your inventory a few days ago? Is that ever acceptable, even once?
---
They have lessons to learn here, and clearly they aren't learing them.
---
The medium and large ones give a random amount of scrip or caps.  Most I've gotten from one is 1000 caps but I think they can give up to 2k.  Keep an eye on them if you are close to max on caps or scrip!
---
I very clearly rememver the hate train starting around the time of E3, months before anyone outside of bethesda got to play it
---
No definition then? That's what I thought
---
I kinda shot him, but I guess my chadness made him disappear completely
---
How long you on for?
---
🤣🤣🤣
---
2 hours
---
Cool . I sent a Fr
---
You want to really piss them off?  Get Fallout 1st.
---
The Scrapbox is the most valuable thing in the game.  The tent is an insane QoL upgrade....and if you plan on buying atoms, it more than pays for itself.  The private server you get is just a bonus for when you want to farm something in peace.
---
Oh I won’t be on until later I’ll give you my gamer tag and if you ever on the same time as me in the future I’m more than happy to team up gamer tag: ScottSigs x
---
Irrelevant comment. Has nothing to do with my post or reply.
---
Where are you located?
---
I don't know who Sterling is, and consequently I don't care what Sterling thinks.
---
And you can describe a lack of basic research as 'can't keep up', but it's still a lack of basic research. Asking paid professional for accuracy isn't a big ask, and it's not a hard thing to deliver. 
---
The game has many problems, but the game's problems don't explain a failure to accurately report them.
---
&gt; But you would think F76 had been the worst game in the history of gaming
---
It's at least among the worst among triple A games in the last decade, yes...
---
This is correct. For example the Christmas Flavored Scorched, one of my team mates would kill it cause they use handmades. But i get no XP but if im near it at the time of death, ill get a loot drop.
---
That is definitely a factor, but the worst are probably "gaming activists" who think they are fighting for a good cause by spreading as much toxicity on social media as possible, and the rest of the crowd is just riding on their bandwagon. The idea (similarly to review bombing) is that this will force developers to obey their demands, when in reality it usually just makes the community toxic, and rarely achieves anything positive.
---
I’ve been grinding for the beanie although I don’t wear those either.. Not sure there’s any logic there. Bummer about the snowflake metal! I had hopes for that one.
---
 I guess part of my point is that the Station is right there. Dumb yer junk. ;)
---
They may just share around 100 atoms to everyone. Not 100 atoms to everyone effected but the "few affected" have to share the 100 atoms
---
I suppose that's true.... from a certain point of view.  On the other hand, we do know from what you said and from others that provided the released footage, that the cameraman that took that footage and released it, did so with the permission of ErectBan.  So from a different point of view, Erectban himself is responsible for the recording and release of that footage, and so is the source.
---
You're naming MrMatty...Someone whose channel was built on positive Fallout 4 content, and was a HUGE fan of Bethesda before FO76. I get that you don't like that people hate on the game you love, but this guy  put hundreds of hours in this game and really wanted to love it but in the end he just has to voice his disappointment.   
---
Not everyone is just shitting on this game because it's the trendy thing to do, but just because they expected so much more from a company they used to love and respect.
---
Thanks, but can’t dump anything when your stash is already at max capacity.
---
Thats not misinformation. If you can't handle the truth i suppose, don't watch it and don't forget to vote trump again...
---
Miniguns are better.
---
Ballistic damage is always better, its more versatile.
---
When the difference matters, energy resist sets the Gat Lasers at the bottom of the viability list.
---
So when I go to smelt lead and make gunpowder I can make thousands of rounds at a time instead of hundreds
---
I love the lore and depth of history in FO76.  It's really embedded deep on all layers and levels.  That's a cool piece of trivia to know though about the Pip Boy.
---
Do any devs release numbers like that?
---
enjoy being a mind controlled drone, leave in peace
---
Yeah they fixed both issues,  people aren't able to steal entire inventories (that was only on PC) and the santa scorched are back...i believe it runs thru the 31st.
---
Stay nearby each other and you will both get the benefits. My friend whom I run around with tags them with the gun and I finish with melee. Sometimes one or the other kills the whole enemy but when in large enemy group situations there’s generally enough XP to go around. Learn how to work together.
---
There was a mod for it in FO4, OCDecorator. Between that and the sheer genius that was the Place Anywhere post, I made some truly bad-ass shit in that game. I understand not being able to decorate on that level in this game, the servers would implode...but we need to be able to at least decorate the shelves, otherwise whats even the point of them?
---
I will. Have fun getting an ulcer over a game you don’t play and claim to not care about
---
I imagine they would have hindered a lot more sales than they motivated, given the level of exaggeration and hyperbole they use for every so called “scandal”
---
This issue is that journalism sites aren't accurate. If there is an issue, which there always is, why do they have to make up false statements, or not get the issues right? It's annoying when an actual problem pops up in-game, and journalism sites can't be bothered to figure out what it is.
---
your talking about yourself, sooner or later
---
And how am I “mind controlled” for developing my own opinion rather than going off of what some YouTuber says?
---
Nah. I’ll pack it away if I don’t like it and move on
---
Well, I use a vampires explosive less ap cost Gatling laser, but it does less dmg to scorch beasts than the non legacy same weapon because of scorched resistances. But that’s different than ballistic so I was just curious
---
Everyone on this subreddit is critiquing Bethesda. Us also critiquing someone who's critiquing Bethesda (journalism sites) isn't defending Bethesda. It's saying they should be competent enough at their jobs to figure out what the issue is so people can know what's actually going on.
---
 You can dump what's valuable. Acid is not that hard.
---
I don't think the op is saying it doesn't......
---
I have a 2* heavy Unyeilding+S  complete combat. I am level 350, I bought it for 15k when I was level 70. I'm still using 3/5 pieces.
---
so short sighted
---
That guy from The Room probably got more money out of it that if it had just been mediocre. I can see people buying 76 just so they can witness the train wreck first hand, kinda like that movie.
---
Cool, but the sentence is still incoherent.
---
What if those bugs and glitches don't affect other platforms where the majority of the playerbase is?
---
Shrouded Wood gives a speed bonus to your sneak/crouched speed. It appears on your pipboy under stats  More pieces quicker movement.
---
 This is really well said. Most of us that played so many hours, have kept up with this game because of the Community. It is by far the best and most passionate I've personally ever seen.
---
Dude that’s awesome!! What a great gift!
---
No room thanks to Christmas scorched drops. It was also hundreds of stabilized flux and thousands of lead scraps not just acid. 4K steel
---
I paid 4K for santa crash, def worth way more.
---
I agree. They're kind of pointless at this point other than a random plant or plushie on top. 
---
Even if they came out with a set of static shelves that were pre decorated. Like one with bathroom clutter, or kitchen clutter, one with tattered books. Just something other than blank shelves
---
it was a meme back in the olden days of a few years ago, used to refer to either the&gt;! erotic action of oral fellatio!&lt; or drinking a beverage [https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/168/531/9cb.jpg](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/168/531/9cb.jpg)
---
Maybe putting a few points into Adamantium Skeleton could fix the issue?
---
I think a lot of it is people are rolling gifts with a severly diluted drop pool. Thats where a lot of the value is coming from imo. Just because they dont know they are doing it the hard way
---
I bought this outfit within the first six months for like 5k caps. Good to know that was a steal!
---
A lazy and (funny enough) factually incorrect response.
---
Yep, I mean maybe yours has a wet towel wrapped around it, idk. I don't need to figure it out though because my PC runs the game just fine.
---
We all dj‘s in 2019/2020 bay bay.
---
Oh op.
---
You're preaching to the choir here.
---
Its been a problem in gaming journalism, and journalism in General, for awhile.
---
Fo76 is just the click generating king right now.  Look at the comments here. Most ppl commenting don't even play the game yet they are here being a part of the "in" crowd.
---
Shitting on fo76 and bethesda is the cool thing to do right now.  Happens all the time every year.
---
Get hacked lately ?
---
I have a few characters one nearing100, one nearing 50 and a few nearing 25 and I've only seen the Mothman three times. Lucky!
---
I played everyday during the beta. I probably crashed once, I mean it is Bethesda, but the I don't actually recall. The beta ran great for me with the exception of a glitched quest at Prickett's Fort. I would have to agree the game ran smoother for me then. Of course, i had a fraction of the inventory. Which might factor. Nowadays, when I open my Stash and take an apparell item out I get 5 to 10 seconds of lag or lockup. Whatever, I'm still having fun.
---
...But it turned out all along he had stolen it first
---
Toxic hate is in.  Toxic gets views.
---
Nope, I'm having an amazing time; no crashes, no lag, no hacks, got some sweet god rolls from the perv yesterday.
---
&gt;  the real issue
---
Like so many others, you're trapped in ideology. 
---
The 'real issue' is not Bethesda. The real issue in this post, because I made the post and thus I choose what I write about, is reddit sourcing and accuracy in games media publications, particularly in relation to Fallout 76's problems.
---
If you can't understand that, or stick to the actual topic which I created, go make your own thread. There is no room here for derailers who want to turn every particularized topic into their broad quest against some hated corporation.
---
Brilliant happy for u dude
---
Where do you go when you fast travel to it?
---
Added pan useraffel
---
It'd also be acceptable if they just reduced the amount of budget space items take up.
---
When reporting on a steaming pile of excrement you tend to keep your distance and miss a few details.
---
I didn't say it was.
---
I thought caps were hard to come by in the beginning. Been playing daily for about 6 weeks now and have made over 50k caps total in that time as a single acct solo. Made level 94 last night. 
---
I am a PA build so plans are grinded or bought from npc or players. At a few k caps a piece from a npc it's a grind to make decent caps to unlock plans. But as a vendor I can move 10k in a few days with pricing. I sit my tse or bse at 5k and if it doesn't move it drops a k in a few days. 
---
Usually within a week most of my good leg are gone and I constantly hover between 9-15k caps.  
---
Plans can be moved for cheap to cap up to make purchases. Yeah if I see cheap stuff in a vendor and i know I can move it for  more you bet I buy it.
---
It's all about fast nickels and slow dimes my friend . The Wasteland demands it.
---
A lot of people get it mixed up. 
---
Robco makes the pip boy and that is its mascot.
---
Vault Tec uses the vault boy as it’s mascot.
---
A sharp and nuanced take that should be obvious to anyone who takes a moment to consider the situation. Well written.
---
You can buy the gun plan from the responder vendor in the whitespring . for the mods craft a bunch of them at lowest level 25 and scrap them to learn mods
---
Your best option is to buy the plan, Craft a bunch with super duper on and turn around and scrap them.
---
Buy the lever gun plan from the Gfaftom vendor. Make your own low level guns and scrap them.
---
Lmfao
---
PC.
---
Just mean that because if you want to use snipers, to deal decent damage you have to use single shot receivers on everything, even assault rifles. Just makes gunplay feel plain when the majority of guns essentially feels the same rather than having variety.
---
&gt; I acted like a professional writer based an article on an unconfirmed situation
---
I'm just going to quote you
---
&gt;but consider that this professional games writer created an entire article based on this empty claim
---
It's not an empty claim, there is plenty of evidence to back their claim. Completely concrete or not, it's not a wild assertion that 500+ users were affected. Plenty of users reported being hit with it here as well. You're making assertions on hypotheticals to discredit an valid statement. 
---
&gt;fantasy of interpretation
---
Read the articles, the first isn't outlandish given it's mostly accepted information backed by community reports and other users. You just don't like the time stamp. Boo hoo. 
---
The second article is mainly talking about the weapon use issue and the event just highlights why it will be a problem. Regardless of what enemy is in the event, the articles main premise isn't changed. And they even amended it, which didn't change the premise.
---
 So again, you're nitpicking to throw an fit about FO76 hate and basic game journalism. It's Kotaku and Polygon, so I don't know what you expect. But even that said, The articles are more correct than they are not, and the small parts that are incorrect don't change or misrepresent the primary issue/subject they are writing about. So again, making this post now, and in this sub, just seems like a "They're so mean to FO76" post.
---
You’re correct I just think it’d be more fun to have variety, rather than a bunch of guns that all feel the same.
---
And then make another video a couple days later referencing that same issue and recommends their prior video covering it... yet still neglect to mention that it's been fixed.
---
I kind of feel the reverse.  It makes for more variety and playstyle choices to have the split the way it is.  ¯\(°_o)/¯
---
Thanks for the help guys.
---
&gt;Example: No more commando, auto guns go with Rifleman, no more Guerrilla, auto pistols go with Gunslinger
---
This is spot on. I’m all for having particular builds but rn it feels like it’s limitation for the sake of it.
---
Maybe. Again. Anyone who trusts bethesda at this juncture is delusional.
---
How easy to find a sloth at Tanagra ?
---
Nuking Whitespring is still the best option for the stabilizing mats. The second best place I've found for enemy density is up in the valley. You can just barely get the area from wavy willards to clarksburg in the zone, and as an added bonus there's an absolute shit ton of violet flux.
---
Yup:  https://imgur.com/a/4Js8sCY
---
Sent you a friend request
---
Bethesda's negligence allowed the hackers to do what they did, both parties are at fault.
---
I understand mate, I do like how 76 feels more build focussed than 4, but imo it feels like it limits fun for the sake of grasping at the RPG genre. Fallout 3 felt much more like an RPG and it terms of weapons it was a lot more broad.
---
Those are all solid ideas. The only change I'd make would be increasing Mutant's to 10% per mutation capped at 5. That would give it an effective 50% max boost and be on par with junkie's.
---
I checked the challenges &amp; I already had 1/2 of hunter &amp; 1/2 of athlete done, finished athlete last night, Rn about to hunt down 3-4 radstags &amp; kill them in various ways to finish hunter. Then I just need to pick 1 more hopefully easy badge =)
---
Idk about that. None of my friends bothered with it because of the reviews.
---
"plenty of evidence to back their claim"
---
"The second article is mainly talking about the weapon use issue"
---
"Regardless of what enemy is in the event, the articles main premise isn't changed"
---
"throw a fit"
---
"The articles are more correct than they are not"
---
"small parts that are incorrect"
---
"seems like a "They're so mean to FO76" post"
---
As I wrote before, fantasy of interpretation.
---
I made these based on those maps a while back: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/byq2pc/some_surprisingly_good_spots_to_farm_flux
---
Also, Use Super Duper and only do a handful at a time. Keep checking to see if you've unlocked the mods you want.
---
Idk why you're being downvoted, you're not wrong lmao. VATS in this game is not slow-mo like it is in FO4...
---
*Places grenade in your pocket*
---
Oh I just looked through your post history. You don't play this game and have nothing but contempt for it, Bethesda, and the community.
---
Get blocked. xD
---
What he finds out though, in part 1 of the sneak experiments, is that the chameleon mutation gives you a hidden sneak bonus regardless what armor you wear.
---
Agreed but more weapons more problems
---
Make sure you have Scrapper perk active and have your intelligence as high as possible when you are scrapping them 👍🏻
---
Not sure, use to see alot more pc trades.  Consoles have always been the majority though.
---
*’Hey, free grenade!  Cool!’*
---
Yea, I'm nearing level 300 and I've still not  unlocked all mods for the Radium Rifle....mods for it seem to be a low drop chance when scrapping.
---
If you asked about your Toyota airbag a few years ago, and someone said you shouldn’t have bought the car, yeah, I guess it would be more trolling than hate.
---
In the video the person only steals from a (relatively) small number of players. It doesn’t show them stealing from anywhere near 500 players. They only claim that’s how many they stole from.
---
Click any PC post then click the blue "PC" box and it will take you to PC posts only. You might have to select "new" instead of "most relevant."
---
Nah...
---
You were promised all post-launch content would be free and atom shop content would be cosmetic only most notably
---
Thanks for trying to help. I must be using an old version of reddit. No dots. Just the three lines that open the drop down menu for inbox, saved, settings, night theme etc.
---
Like a player camp building service?
---
Oh okay, your welcome. The dots are in the top-right corner of the screen as i forgot to mention, but i honestly have no idea other than that. Sorry! :)
---
I think it's a dedicated spawn point for at least one.
---
I do like the idea it'd be amazing for the people who don't like building but blueprints don't work 99% of the time anyway so they'd have to fix that first.
---
That is a really cool notion that would never have occurred to me. If building didn’t have so many weird placement glitches I think this would be fun as hell.
---
Oh okay, your welcome. The dots are in the top-right corner of the screen on the Fallout 76 Sub-Reddit, as i forgot to mention. But i honestly have no idea other than that. Sorry! :)
---
Yeah that gun is notorious for being a pain like that.  Not sure if it was intentional or a mess up in the coding but it has the same mod unlock rate as armor mods unlike all the other weapons in the game. I haven't even bothered trying to unlock them yet.
---
On my other level 50 I ran out of special stats points so i was not able to get all the perks for stealth comando bloody build
---
What everyone else said, but pop a mentat too!
---
I have a hard time sharing blueprints with friends (dropping the blueprinted design in a workshop or camp area and allow them to blueprint it themselves) because if you have even one item they don’t have they can’t build any of that  structure.
---
If there were a way around that I’d be all in!
---
I suggest you stay in the forest area until 15-20, then go north to toxic valley.
---
Collision course at Morgantown airport, the event at the lighthouse...Feed the people at mama dolces, back on the beat in Morgantown... 
---
Visit riverside manor and camp McClintock.
---
At 27 or so, head south to the ash heap, stopping at the mining HQ near the 3 legged towers along the way.
---
And once you’re done at west tek head north to that sat array, lots of pumpkins and phones for plastic and there are a bunch of typewriters, fans and globes plus you can usually find a legendary or two there. Plus a weapons bench behind the parking building out back to scrap your hoard
---
That was the thing I was looking for. Thanks !
---
I had this happen on a private server this afternoon (UK time). I was in Westtec . First I kept seeing a supermutant in just his knickers just standing there inside westtec. I couldn't kill him &amp; he didn't attack. But he kept zipping to a new spot &amp; scaring the bejebus out of me. Like disappearing &amp; then reappearing next tom when I moved.
---
Then I thought I was being punched but there was nothing there &amp; it followed me through the building (the invisible punching). I had to leave the building &amp; run &amp; hide before I could fast travel away.
---
No one touches the 5mm in my vendor, I just keep adding to it, I think I’ve got like 13k in there
---
 Stabilized Flux is difficult, the rest are easy. Still its not what one thinks about, when there are 3 out there. ;)
---
"I didn't read what this person gave as context for their talking point. Now allow me to moralize at you about business practices in multiple threads under this topic."
---
Everyone knows the game is a mess. You're not helping by being pedantic about it. The OP raises a good, valid, and accurate point about people lying about the game to make it sound worse.
---
It has enough problems to not lie about so why are they lying?
---
We should form a gang.  You on PC?
---
I get lag at the robot vendors and anywhere around whitesprings but that’s pretty much it.
---
Yeah, it sucks the game forces you to pick up everything you see. Stupid game. Damn you Bethesda!!!
---
Jesus you people find anything to bitch about. Just play a different game.
---
Amen!
---
Great post!
---
It's one of the most irritating things when criticism comes from someone who has little to no knowledge or real experience of a topic. People who judge these games just based on hearsay and bare minimum info really are doing a service to the situation overall. Many 76 players can REALLY go all in harshly about the game, but their opinion is much more valid than those who have no real connection with the game. Listen to the real players, and not those who pretend to know what they say!
---
Love ya'll! Happy Holidays / Christmass timeeeee! 💻💦🎈🎊🥳🌲🐧
---
So after 20, it doesn't matter?
---
Wouldn't it be the 2 Billion since we have a Pip Boy 2000?
---
So, what do we expect of the 5.2 relic weapons?
---
Look under Aid :)
---
What he say?
---
Ha. Thank you. When you have a thousand different items, it can be a little cumbersome to find stuff.
---
its in the aid tab.
---
best two methods i have seen:
---
- take a group through glassed cavern, mine ultricite
---
- take workshops, put a locked santatron in each one with your camp
---
I’m a bloodied commando build with 1 strength and a carry weight of 286, more if I deep pocketed everything (I prefer ultra-light). Strength does not equal survival.
---
It's an RPG, what do you expect?
---
Wasn't too sure of the amount, thanks for the correction!
---
I love those maps! Totally appreciate the work that went into them! I get messages all the time, why did you nuke that place???? Followed by a negative comment... lol 
---
I just reply flux farming!
---
Anyone who would be mad that Bethesda reworked the game from the ground up is probably a troll or a Youtuber lol
---
It’s in your Aid tab. Lots of ways to farm more: run through well known Scorched populated areas (my favorites have been Glassed Cavern and Big Bend Tunnel) and listen for the jingling bells. If you’re on a private world, take over every workshop and put a Santatron on each one. Then just jump from workshop to workshop and collect!
---
However you do it, there are lots of holiday gifts to be had and plenty of time left In the event.
---
RED CHINESE OPPRESSORS DETECTED!!
---
#wait no
---
the best method i have found is taking 1-8+ workshops and putting sanatron at each and letting them farm for you while you go about your business.   most times easier to not address the attacks until they are retakes. makes it alot faster as you will be having a lot of attacks with 8 workshops.  Also would help to be on private server if possible to prevent stealing and such
---
I read this as pop tart lol
---
Awesome. Thank you for the suggestions everyone!
---
People like Yong and Cass give it the appearance of a trainwreck by never touching on the good aspects of the game and focusing on issues that most of the time are no longer issues. They source things out of context or source things that are incorrect or outdated information.
---
Do you run around like me starving and dehydrated because you don't want to eat and drink that stuff?
---
After the first billion who’s counting?
---
So in order to have a challenging game I have to intentionally make it harder by myself? That sounds like bad game design.
---
&gt;I am literally forced to use perks that reduce chems carry weight cause  otherwise I'd have to throw them away as there is no more space in the  stash. 
---
Or you could, you know, sell them to a vendor for caps... 🤷‍♂️
---
Honestly I hope they do this at some point. I rather suspect that this is the reason they keep reintroducing bugs because they are working with different forks. If they did a refactor with everything reworked into the base files they might be able to quash some of the more frequent reoccurring bugs.
---
Also it would help with some of the phased loading (for example when you go to the purveyor and it takes a while for the door and legendary vendor machines to load in becuase they are in different archive files.
---
Internet + Anonymity = Assholes.
---
The G.I.F.T (Greater Internet Fuckwad Theory).
---
Do you blame your local government when someone breaks one of their laws?
---
Scrap wall variants, roofs, and rocks and bushes along with greenhouse walls are all I really want. They exist in fo4. It would be so easy to just bring them over.
---
Sucks you had to rebuild your camp. That happened to me the first time I was ever attacked at my camp, where i had to go back and collect all the resource to rebuild. Ever since that, if someone starts attacking me at my camp, I just leave the world. You know what you're getting into at a workshop and what to expect, but people just coming to your camp to murder you that you've never had any interactions with is a bit of an annoyance.
---
go get a snack and come back when done
---
To me a lot of it seems like people who are too childish to realize video games are inconsequential IRL and they like attention so they come here to rant in a quest for validation. That's why every time there's a new bug the inevitable 'i've had enough!' rants also begin. They can't just walk away because no one would care. They want those upvotes from the rest of the haters to feed whatever dopamine response they're craving. I'm just speculating though.
---
Something I like to do is put on my excavator armor and head to glassed cavern for all the ultracite ores and make scrap. They sell for a lot at vendors.
---
I wish we could dance though lol
---
This game has no audience. It’s not a survival game because of this, it’s not a PvE game because it’s online, has no story, and all the enemies are easy as fuck, it’s not a PvP game because they removed half the elements of PvP and the others have been dumbed down. Right now, Fallout 76’s target audience isn’t people who enjoy video games at all, it’s whales. All Bethesda wants from this game is more money, this is not a real fallout game, it’s just a money pit and they use the excuse that the community made it that way. Nobody asked for repair kits, scrap kits, or fallout first, all they wanted was more utility items, like sinks and the Mr. Fuzzy ride, but Bethesda then goes “WeLl YoU gUy’S aSkEd FoR iT” like people wanted to pay $12.99 a month to play the game that half the people got for $60+. All this game does is punish fans of fallout for liking a game franchise and wanted to share that interest with others, there is no content, there is no substance, it’s just a bland farming simulator with RNG involved which makes it even harder for the casual player to be anything more. 
---
The lack of a lot of shit on release proves this, the game physics breaking when you uncapped you frame rate, the lack of anti-cheat for over a year, the ability to just fucking turn off the world border in the files. At release you could do almost anything you wanted if you could figure it out, but Bethesda as I said doesn’t care, they don’t care about duping, they don’t care about hacking, and they don’t care about selling stuff online.
---
Because in vendor you can’t go below 1cap / round. They aren’t worth that. In Discord you can trade/sell for .35 or .5 per round
---
Why does it take so long?
---
\#2 works a LOT better on private servers.. so if you lack them your better off focusing on #1
---
People frustrated about a bug is not toxic. People saying Bethesda are idiots, incompetent, stupid because a bug exists is toxic. People saying that people who enjoy the game with the bugs are idiots, sheep, mouthbreathers,blind are toxic. That is usually the type of complaint you'll see when a bug arises.
---
What is your current level? I got my call pretty centered with water nearby including a nice view. But it’s not suited for low level
---
It's worth pointing out that the video showing 30-40 players being hacked in a 10 minute video isn't a single cut, it's cut together skipping all the time going from one player to the next. Who knows how long it actually took to rob 30 players.
---
Yeah the new walls look like they were designed to make camps stick out like sore thumbs, whereas 4s were immersive and realistic considering it’s *post-apocalypse*.
---
Ok, i don't watch that stuff. I played the game myself, it is a disaster. Crashing every 30 minutes, weird sounds that wont go away, screen going black, and that was just the first week!
---
I know of a nice flat spot in the savage divide but it's on a cliffside with no water :/
---
68 I do believe, running TSE shotgun build
---
He probably does.
---
Pc? Else I could show it to you. Anything over 25 should be already fine
---
Ok, have you played since the first week?
---
There’s a spot next to New Gad that has some hood water area and a Steel deposit that you can put a resource extractor on.
---
Merry Christmas!  Here's hoping you have a blue screen-free New Year! Thanks again, Melissa
---
Yup, same here, right down to the random negative messages :)
---
I usually nuke WS a couple times to gather mats, and then check the flux map and nuke a spot with a high density of whichever color I'm looking for.
---
I don't feel that your comparison applies here, but yes, if my government has hired no police men (anti-cheat) I would give them some of the blame if criminals were running rampant.
---
It was during the major development phase. That they told the entire world this.
---
PS4, do you pic of map maybe? I should be able to scope it out if not tho
---
No they absolutely did not and I challenge you to link one single thing that says the first week of release was a major development phase. I dare you.
---
There are a lot of PC games with heavy anti-cheat measures that still have new hacks developed for them. If you think anti-cheat measures 100% eliminate ANY chance of hackers affecting the game you are the blind one.
---
Can you even sprint?
---
&gt; Now if he can steal stuff from 78 people in a 12min thats sped up
---
Sped up and edited to reduce the time it takes to travel between player to player, also probably on a single server people robbed by the same person multiple times.
---
I took like 8 or 10 Workshops last weekend and built a santatron at each one.. I ended up with a god amount of holiday gifts just swinging by every Workshop and camp every hour or so. You can also visit Fissure sites, pick one ultracite ore, kill the scorched that spawn, repeat. Or you can go around lockpicking peoples Santatrons and looting their gifts, people seem to be doing that and having a buddy kill them to remove the bounty. Take care!
---
Well excuse me for not following the development phases for every game. I would also challenge you to find a single link where they say "this game is experimental" as I have not seen it.
---
Don't you bring your perfectly reasonable solutions in here!
---
This studio is shit and will be gone pretty soon. I was excited for the games they were going to release and older games I was gonna buy but over a year ago decided nah someone got a promotion and didnt deserve it. See ya B
---
Fast travel to Hunter's Ridge and head south until you hit the river. Follow the river bank SE a little bit and you'll come to a big flat gravel/grassy area along the river bank with a junk node next to it. Plenty of space to build, almost no enemy spans other than the occasional mole rat, and a nice scenic view of the river and forest on the other side.
---
I was repeating what you said. Idk man, being shitty at something isn’t really an excuse to be rude about people who are good at it
---
pm me your ign Ill see if I have extra when I get on tonight, dude
---
And then it was reverted within 5 minutes, because that's how wikipedia works.
---
Yup I got that set from uranium fever probably the second month of the game. Always been looking for it again...
---
I’m not aware of any fixed spawn locations where you can find a Lever just laying around. I occasionally find it as loot on Snallygasters and other creatures, but that’s a rare occurrence...  I don’t think I’ve ever seen a Scorched use one.  For the mods, I just had to grind it out with making/scrapping them.
---
So if the anti-cheat isn't 100% effective then they should have none at all? What about Nuclear Winter, it is reported that it is rife with hackers for months, and still nothing has been done.  
---
I've also personally never played a game that had a hack as catastrophic as other players being able to delete your inventory with no way to restore it.
---
Yeah, you'll find stuff bears doing something to the other bears a lot! Kinda funny with a WTF?! Moment when you see it.
---
Right up until they started breaking their "only cosmetic" promise.
---
I know this is incredibly rude to say to anyone who got targeted by this:  You had it coming.  You are GENUINELY LUCKY this is the way you've gotten screwed over by this game and not anything worse.  Please, anyone, everyone still playing, I beg you to take this as a sign to STOP and find something else.  I mean, let's be real, if you literally don't care about your own money or just want a broken piece of shit to hack and wreck havoc in, then sure.  I bet you get your money's worth.  To everyone else trying to play this game the way it was "intended" to be played...  For your own sake, just don't bother anymore.  Fallout 76 hardly qualifies as a real game at this point, it's just some ruined outdated internet servers they used to psychologically trick people into giving them as much money as possible for as little effort on their part as they can manage.  Bethesda does not deserve your money, or your time.  If you can run this cancer your computer can run some other, likely much cheaper game that will almost certainly be objectively better than Fallout 76, and hopefully you can find one that isn't going to try and find increasingly desperate ways to beg you for cash while letting shit like this happen and pretending it's been a good year.
---
The high capacity is super beneficial, but personally I like the anti-rad one for nuke zones. With the right perks and armor, theres no need for PA solo
---
Damn, this made my day. Nice setup!
---
It´s pretty much this location https://youtu.be/ca-H-BTwcpE?t=190 (03:10).
---
The only attacks I have are wolves. And those are kinda rare.
---
High cap is clearly nice, but I have found the lead lined to be my most used.  I never use my Armored one, it was a waste sadly, fortunately got it cheap 4k.
---
I don't really mind the PA while in nuke zone since I'm not trying to be quiet. It's one of few times I use it.
---
High capacity is amazing, but it's selective. 
---
I only slap it on while scavenging or overweight and needing to fast travel. The armor/energy resistance drop from wearing it is just too much to justify 100% use. 
---
Armor mod is my main, followed by rad resist as a close 2nd. 
---
I'm currently working towards the energy resist mod just to have it during AWOL Armaments and Nuke Silos. (+whatever quest will be inside the observatory with non-stop spawning bots)
---
Oh, you mean the stuff you can buy that people label as pay to win in a game where there is nothing to win?
---
For random outfits and such, you're much better off posting your own thread asking for one and offering a fair value in caps or some other random rare outfits.
---
I'm probably the furthest thing from a hardcore gamer - my non-Mario/Zelda gaming experience is limited to basically the Fallout and Assassin's Creed series. I'm still a relatively low-level player (below 50), and I don't find it negative at all.  Quite the opposite: most folks are helpful and fun.  
---
I've had higher level players give me loot and gear almost from my first day playing. I made maybe the most annoying "newb" mistake you can do - in my first Scorchbeast Queen fight, I got killed fairly easily... and one of the ultra high level players stopped to revive me.  I've visited camps and bought little things out of vending machines (I usually don't have more than a couple hundred caps, so I'm not a big spender), and had camp owners give me a gift, or open their locked doors so I could use their resources, or invite me to be a friend or to their teams.  I asked Reddit for help with a specific item I lost, and a Redditor from the other side of the world not only got online at a weird time of day for them to give it to me, they also gave me tons of plans and recipes and even a suit of power armor.
---
Griefers really are few and far between, at least in my experience.  It's much more likely you'll run across someone helpful who will take you under their wing.
---
&gt;I am literally forced to use perks that reduce chems carry weight cause otherwise I'd have to throw them away as there is no more space in the stash
---
That's not what "forced" means. You have alternatives in dumping or selling them. You just don't like them.
---
Yes, the game has multiple problems and issues. "I have too much stuff" doesn't really rank amongst them.
---
https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2018/10/23/bethesdas-confusing-fallout-76-note-to-fans-is-a-perfect-kick-off-to-the-beta/
---
Right there that letter from Bethesda was available and publicly put out during the beta release.
---
Lol, AWOL is the only event that I die at repeatedly. I really can't afford to lose any resistances so maybe I should steer toward armor
---
they can't be bothered because the situation is laughable, it hardly warrants it, that's the point. they're not noticing on a particular issue, but rather on how bad Fo76 (still) is.
---
&gt;I imagine if Bethesda does believe news sites, they'd be wasting a lot of time checking for bugs that don't exist.
---
very funny of you, thinking Bethesda actually bothers checking for bugs unless people make a big stink out of it here or in the forums. in fact, if you people held them to the same standards as youtubers, maybe then bugs from the beta and even Fo4 wouldn't linger one year after release.
---
The day of release, really? That is not a "major development phase" in the slightest. It was not a beta, it was a b.e.t.a and anyone can tell you that nothing was changed from that one week b.e.t.a to the next week of "release."
---
Literally anyone can blindly believe in falsehoods which is why ignorance like yours can always be immediately dismissed as stupidity.
---
I use the armor plated mod. 
---
I keep a standard backpack handy if I need a bit extra carry weight.
---
Im currently working on the rad resist mod.
---
I would stay away from the high cap.  If you need that much extra carry weight, you should jump in excavator instead.  The hit to defense is just too big to be viable.
---
Saved by relative privation again
---
He doesn't understand how games work or how hackers constantly break them. 
---
People have hacked world of warcraft and broken the game several times but blizzard's had years to prepare for most of those.
---
Bethesda's still trying to figure out how to make a fallout game just like a normal fallout game but with online interaction.
---
Honestly I thought with the 50 atom Raider totems we were gonna see a lot more of that. 
---
That was an incredible price per item for it's 'quality' and I wish they followed suite in other areas.
---
I guess no-one else bought them because right after the 'decor' options / sets went back to being 350 / 500
---
They could convert the existing clutter 'sets' the level artists use as workshop objects. Even if they were clumped together a la ZAX presents it would be better then nothing.
---
I use refrigerated due to for some reason, it stops ALL food decay not just 60%(bug?)
---
Lets me hold onto some flux for a few days and its still 100% CND. I am slow getting the fluids needed to convert them, this lets me take my time.
---
When (or if) its ever fixed, I'd prob use the anti rad one instead. High capacity is only really good imo for when I need to fast travel and am Overburdened, the hit to resistances is too much cost for the 60 extra weight allowance.
---
Yes, the pay to convenience items that, no mater what you want to call them, are not cosmetic only.
---
You're just going to ignore anything except your own voice. I've given you solid evidence. 
---
You've already made up your mind and thus my original post sticks.
---
No I don't usually need that much but the option would be nice. I always keep my excavator on me anyway for when I get overweight.  Im usually too heavy for all other PA.
---
Not sure if you saw this before purchase
---
You absolutely did not provide solid evidence, that was the day of release. I don't think you can back up your claim and your refusal to do so only validates my belief.
---
I totally forgot that I found this one the other day: [Bear stew, I guess?](https://images-eds-ssl.xboxlive.com/image?url=MSVnmBUo_fHjbLYMjAEUQ0pdKB2YkZq5Ep2XNngwnYSHX0kIXtMvdFilEyc4faKYZszCZZsUpUaZtMnU6lHZJarAWBk9yAZi6Vxqcw9_W7lUK.5xB8dydNtB3Ly.ogXA7ebGP1fjxKozmiExD1atI79TU2Hf2X47BY5rb7D9Q2svy1K7P66DauXH4V6aFnyhaA5SFwhCRAZPZYrax9wBlUtaqSisE32dcpS5t2qaxa5hTWfB_h1YtJcaHtoyNoNzWHrl1yYTY39NqyuX93jHJyLZ3TUhrxJrgYpxmkip_Nc-&amp;h=1350&amp;w=1350&amp;format=jpg)
---
Sorry that you're too blind to see the truth.
---
your builds are always such a delight! thank you for making this!
---
But they are so fun. Orbital strikes are glorious!
---
I did, and it mentions nothing of them going back on their promise of only cosmetic microtransactions.
---
It is on Bethesda. A game engine going on ten years and exploits like this still exist? The fact that multiple fallout 4 glitches made it to the "mmo" version of the game released years later just lets you know how much attention to detail they paid when it came to actually updating the game...
---
That’s literally my current base location lol I don’t like it cause it’s so hard to build on that ledge of rock above the cave area
---
I just pop all known recipes/plans into my venders @ 0 caps.
---
None of them (except maybe the most stupidly rare ones for no other reason than for them to be stupidly rare) are hard enough to find that I haven't found 10+ copies, and this lets others get all of them they need to. Whats nice about the community in general, is I have not yet had a single person take more than 1 of any they need (Even the rare-er ones priced usually at 1500+ at other peoples camps) and i also sometimes see paper bags sitting next to my venders full of more plans (some of which I actually needed, thanks btw if anyone here dropped them, appreciated)
---
Take your time and explore, pick up and scrap everything you can as not only you'd need those materials you also learn mods from doing so while also gaining XP.
---
Sweet tip, thank you, will give it a try! (You must've known- always looking for the Violet when I'm attempting to collect everything.)
---
So no evidence then? I will no longer respond until you are able to provide any.
---
I've still never pieced together a good set of armor, so I guess I should probably not lose any resistances. As far as rads, PA takes care of that.
---
I mean rad resist is nice since most non PA builds struggle a bit with that
---
If you have enough badges to make 2 I would go with the armor plated and high cap. They only weigh 1lb each, so you can afford to carry 2 and switch to the high cap when you need that extra 30lbs of weight to get home or to a vendor.
---
That's something I think everyone can agree was a bad move. Could be someone much higher up told them to change it. With disregard for the development team or players. This is why you never want investors to buyin to your game development. 
---
Look what Activision and Sont did to destiny.
---
I'm a Melee build instigating as super sledge he has an explosive shotgun and gatling plasma is anybody game? 
---
Psn useraffel
---
The evidence was provided you're just refusing to accept it.
---
I ran into absolutely no problem since I use a stelt base. Try the lake up the hill tho, it’s similar but has a wide flat area
---
It would be fair to say that I may have been more offended by this than most, as I have always refused to buy games with non-cosmetic transactions. When they reversed that after I had already purchased the game I felt cheated.
---
Exactly.  
---
I thought the raider stuff was priced right.  I just hate the raiders so I didn't buy any. Lol. They do need more small things though
---
I only use PA in a nuke zone and it does require a little prep and perk rearranging but I dont mind since it's not a constant thing.
---
you make it sound like they're making up lies about how Todd eats children for breakfast or is in cahoots with fascist supremacists.
---
when in fact they just can't be bothered to get every detail right considering the article isn't about a particular issue, but rather about a dumpster fire that keeps on raging a whole year after it started.
---
&gt; overloaded loot.
---
Do you know FROST, the FO4 mod?
---
Perma Frost runs was my only game, during the year previous to FO76.
---
The resources are ultra-limited. Big time and attention is needed to  properly manage them. 
---
But once you stabilise is the same thing. You have to devote certain % of the playtime to farm resources for surviving. 
---
In FO76 this activity can take the 5% of the time when you know the stuff. 
---
In Frost more than 50%.
---
but in deep, it's the same thing. I love this, but not everyone's cup of tea...
---
Im dumb, where is this blue pc box?
---
Thanks for check them out :)
---
But being upset doesn't make you toxic nor hateful. Right now you're showing your frustrations in a positive and constructive way. 
---
The toxicity I'm talking about is the blind hatred for Bethesda no matter what happens. Even if it's something they have no control of until after it has come to life.
---
As someone who runs a pure explosive build honestly its pretty dope. That being said there should be some defense against it. If im running solo grenade launcher it gets tough but when im using it as a support in my main group it can get devastating.
---
The real beat method is to steal from camps. You will get wanted though so need to have someone kill you after each steal so you see other camps on the map!
---
Is it near top of the world? I see the big red saucer clear as day from this lake
---
It seemed like quite a grind to get some of these,  I'm not sure it'll be a while before I get more. Also, do the challenges reset or something? There isn't 8 more left.
---
It’s the one before that shown in the video
---
When are you running?
---
Down to do vault 94?
---
Useraffel
---
We are gearing up now
---
This game is an incredibly unique concept. How to survive in a post apocalyptic wasteland while also suffering from a hoarding disorder and occasionally needing to eat and drink.
---
Survival mode was an option in earlier games so I've got to assume at least some casual fans of the series would be more likely to play this game without those parts and shouldn't their goal have been to attract as many players as possible and hope they stick around. Because seriously if they are not going to make the survival aspects matter at all why don't they just remove them? Remove hunger and thirst, since people will still use the items for the boosts anyway. They could make ammo &amp; aid weightless and just put an absolute cap on the amount you can hold on your person at one time like 99 stimpacks. All that micromanaging doesn't really add anything to the gameplay here. Would anyone anywhere enjoy the game less if those things were removed?
---
Gameplay can be made much harder and more enjoyable than just the random survival concepts they bothered to include. Why don't some of the most difficult enemies have instant kill attacks? You're telling me a SBQ couldn't just bite your damn head off it she wanted to when you get too close to her head when she is grounded. Those Deathclaw kills need to return as well.
---
Useraffel on now trying to get a team to do vault 94
---
Oh yes, you mean the ones you can unlock with the free in game obtainable atoms?
---
It wasnt, and still isnt, i made sure.
---
But you are proving my point here dude.
---
Bethesda is decidedly stream-lining the process so everyone can pick up the game and not go "ugh...I have this really good gun, but I'm locked into this build which is very specific to this other class of gun" 
---
I enjoy the system from 1/2,  new vegas, and even 3... But realistically I get it.
---
No mirror ball?!
---
Useraffel looking for friends to raid vault 94
---
Dang I’ll be on in 45min
---
Such as scrap kits, infinite scrap storage, and a second camp in the form of a tent? I don't believe that any of those can be unlocked for free.
---
The big thing to keep in mind about perks in F76 is you can't let players get more powerful than the world they're in. 
---
Best way to keep a advantage over the player base is make them make concessions around perks. You can't be a superman build that can do it all - you have to specialize which induces weaknesses. 
---
Think about in F4 / FNV how by the end - once you more or less have all the good perks - you can become an unbeatable terminator. 
---
If that happened in F76 - IMHO - everyone would get bored pretty quick and there would be no recurrent-lifetime value in levelling or specc'ing. 
---
It must be noted too that a card-based system also provides a well-known UX framework to players young and old for obtaining perks / cards *(in random blister packs)* and having a 'hand' / field of cards *(active perks)* for you to swap perks in and out from a deck *(unactivated cards).* 
---
as /u/Trickay1stAve mentioned you have the mascots mixed up: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ege3w2/beths\_put\_in\_more\_nods\_to\_fallout\_1\_than\_i/fc63cyz?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ege3w2/beths_put_in_more_nods_to_fallout_1_than_i/fc63cyz?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)
---
Berry, preferably.
---
Ha. Sounds shady, but it's a mechanic in the game I suppose.
---
We will wait
---
Wait, there is another one beyond the 14k?
---
I’ll add
---
Enough with the "Enough with the 'Enough already'" posts. It's a valid complaint.
---
No need to explain. Just edit the sentence so it makes sense.
---
Click any post that is for PC. Then below the title on the left is a blue box that says PC

I used to do the cap stash run from poseidon, kill the grafton monsters otw to WS, BW mine, ft up to morgantown and get those. But now it seems like they really nerfed the shit out of the spawns, you might get 300 or 400 caps now, where you used to get 1100+ a night. I'll check it out again though, maybe they just have a small chance of not spawning at their locations and I just had bad luck /shrug
---
For people interested, look up Mappalachia on here, theres a Caps Stash, bobblehead, magazine location map on there you can you to figure out some nice loops.
---
&gt; few players 
---
bruh
---
That's one of the reasons all the mindless hate thrown at youtubers around here does nothing but piss me off. "People who don't actively play the game shouldn't talk about it" is said often.  By fucking \_morons\_ who don't know how word of mouth works.   
---
I LOVE it when someone hate-posts about bethesda. Every time Jim Sterling does his little "Bethesda's done bad" boogie I laugh, every time Yong chimes in a week or two after a disaster I celebrate.   
---
Because even if these people \_hate\_ bethesda, they \_hate\_ fallout  76, these fucking \_idiots\_ need to learn the number one rule of advertising. There is \_no\_ bad publicity.   
---
And on top of that, no matter what the die hard fanboys say, betheda deserves \_every single\_ negative video they receive, every negative comment, every "Don't buy their products" because lets be real. This game is a fucking train wreck and they need more pressure to do right by the community.
---
Most of what you meantioned is the fo1st service which is a separate feature not offered in the atomic ship which is what you're complaining about.
---
More evidence that the game is all in-world simulation? Except it's not a village in China but actually just from Vault Tec.
---
I've never seen anyone suggest that before and wow that's a good idea!
---
FYI there are 26 straight jackets at Fort Defiance: 1 outside in the courtyard on the south side of the building (next to a bench), 1 in the room just to the right when you enter the building, 4 in the restricted left (north) area in the building, and 20 on the right (south) area in the building.  With good Charisma, they sell for about 50 caps each.  
---
And don’t forget the “clean” worker uniforms that occasionally spawn here can go for 1000s of caps to players who like to collect them...
---
They need civil feedback to improve, not the ignorant toxicity spewing from players like you.
---
Inspecting the blueprint would need to list the plans required for it and show (Known) or not, and right there I know it's too much work for Bethesda :( :(
---
This \^ right here.
---
I have my camp as a log cabin/watchtower combo, but I did not realize how much things add up.  I'm considering dismantling all my turrets and remove some lights and my tato/mutfruit trees (I run PA so I rarely need to make adhesive now) to free up a little space.
---
Awesome what's your build?
---
Getting one shotted by a Gunner with an Instigating Gauss rifle is fun. "So that's how it feels to be an NPC enemy."
---
Let me ask you this simple question:  
---
Are there noncosmetic items in the atomic shop?  
---
As for fo1, they also mentioned that all future content would be free. Now I can understand that this comes down to semantics but, imo, those fo1 features qualify as content.
---
&gt; So in order to have a challenging game I have to intentionally make it harder by myself? 
---
Have you played any Bethesda game since Skyrim? 😋
---
wow MORE words just to say "I don't care if they are lying or just incompetent as long as they agree with me" WONDERFUL ethical system you have there
---
Still need another? I can hop on now. Lvl 263, PA junkies heavy gunner
---
There are non-cosmetic items in the atomic shop. But guess what. I don't care and I have all of them and I didn't spend one single real world dollar on them and I still enjoy the game every time I play every day.
---
Thought of putting my camp near whitesprings, but I actually like having a view of Watoga and Cranberry Bog, plus there is a small lake for purifiers and the only enemies I've seen are under level 20 and it's rare they spawn (usually radrats or molerats)
---
Melee Bloodied main but I switch it up Inside vaults for full health
---
Ignorant toxicity. Ok dude. 
---
Do you want to _guess_ how many times i've reported bugs, commented on issues, supplied "hey, this fixed that bug for me" comments in the forum? 
---
Nah. I don't, 100%, ignore bethesdas failing in not addressing issues that have been around since day one. (I stopped playing today because of the no-respawn point bug that's been around since day one, for fucks sake) So I'm spewing "ignorant toxicity" according to fucking moronic fanboys.
---
I spent 4 hours rebuilding my camp last night... gross
---
But popping a Rad-X (Diluted) mostly solves the same problem.  Unless it's a Nuke Zone, but the backpack isn't going to help you there either.
---
Fallout 4 was the same way - even in survival mode .  I remember being surprised because i thought survival games were supposed to be about living in a world of scarcity  - but there were stuff everywere
---
Doesn’t work well once you hit that weight/stash limit, adn you find you don’t really need all of it.
---
Sell it off at vendors to hit the daily cap limit.  Then go buy plans You want for PA mods, armor mods, etc.
---
I got mine hanging over the bed in my camp.
---
Riiiiight
---
I have an Instigating Power attack super sledge 2 star max level if you want it
---
I think Refrigerated has been the most useful for me, because I get to always have buffing food on me now, which is good for Bloodied melee.  High-Capacity isn't too useful for day-to-day running around because of its penalties, but if you're over-cucumbered and in a spot, it's an easy way to get out.  Especially if you don't have the TENT from Fallout 1st.
---
Lead-Lined used to be useful for me, because my armor choices often didn't have rad resistance.  But since I went in a more Sneak-oriented direction, and kill Ghouls before they even get close to me, it hasn't been that big a deal.
---
I have grinded all the mods . I use refrigerator usually but always carry the high capacity with me at all times. I have a spare high capacity plan I was going to give it away for Christmas and went to several camps and dropped it as a gift and no one took it so I just picked it up and still have I sold my last one in my vender for 20,000 caps it went within 10 minutes. I may put it in my vender for new year for zero caps not sure yet. Whatever you decide just keep grinding and get them all.
---
Each of the associated scouting events has a ~25% chance of awarding a badge. Just play camp fire tales every time you see it, and make sure to do the two other scout daily missions each day. Alternatively, if you have caps to burn you can usually find someone willing to sell the mods for 8-10k.
---
Yea sure
---
Defcon Status of Fo76:
---
Huge Dumpsterfire since release. Not expected to be extinguished till 2021
---
That last sentence IS toxicity defined. Not civility.
---
by your logic anyone that ever gets anything wrong is lying. nothing but the absolute, 100% truth is acceptable.
---
if they get the color of an unreleased skin wrong then obviously they're trying to hurt the game and Bethesda as a whole because their pants are on fire.
---
Request sent, signing on now
---
Are you on Xbox??? I'll buy it right now!!
---
Definitely gonna grind them all just trying to decide where to start
---
Yeah, get gaming companies to hire private investigators to come to your home and vaguely threaten you to stop. Let's follow that model. Fuck that dude.
---
I want to see Deacon spying on me from within all the groups that return in Wastelanders. I don't care if it breaks canon, since there is plenty in this game already does anyway.
---
Were you drinking lemonade? If so it gives a debuff called "Sugar Crash Hangover" which lowers AP and regeneration.
---
I would personally take the fridge one first as your food never spoils
---
My dailies haven't shown up in a long time and I don't know why. You mean the repeatables like stings and things?
---
 "I don't care if they are lying or just incompetent as long as they agree with me" 
---
When your entire job description is based on reporting facts.....yeah. Lying or Incompetence.
---
Thank you
---
I've been asking for this for a while. Fireproof 3 would only negate the same amount of damage that demo expert gives. It wouldn't be a hard counter to an explosive build.
---
I had no debufs and it persisted through server hops
---
Had to restart be back in a flash
---
Awww fuck
---
You're saying bad situations don't require verification from news outlets... What? 
---
There have been over a thousand bug fixes. And this isn't about whether you even have a standard for Bethesda Game Studios. It's about whether you're lying for clicks. And who are you to say we don't criticize Bethesda Game Studios? Just because we're critiquing websites and channels that are consistently "anti-FO76" doesn't mean we're pro-FO76. (I've shared my fair share of bug reports and criticism). You should have the capacity to correct anyone who's wrong, regardless of who's side they're on.
---
Truthfully? I don't think they'd need to do an entire 2.0 style thing. The majority of the core of the game is good, its just littered with bugs that need squishing and a better endgame hook than what we've got. 
---
The first thing could be fixed with a dedicated public test server being put out for people, with a team focused on resolving what's figured out through that.
---
As for the second part? That might be a bit harder to do, though it may change quite a bit with the Wastelanders release. I think if we could get some kinda factional system with the BoS/Enclave/Responders/Raiders/Free-States, maybe like a faction rally sort of thing similar to Destiny 2 where people can post up to a specific faction, run events and stuff to get points for their faction and earn faction related rewards, and then maybe like a big end of rally event based on which faction won the rally...
---
I do not see it, is it cuz im using firefox?
---
or, nobody cares about the details because this is Fo76.
---
I'm assuming you're the kind of person who would go "hey, look, a penny!" while the building next to it is on fire. you're still missing the point. nobody but this sub cares they get the details wrong because there are way, way bigger issues.
---
Would be nice. More likely they brake multiple things and i can enjoy another r/fo76 shitstorm
---
So if you want to discus game balance you are bitching ?  great to know
---
Yeah, I made them harder with mods. Can't do that here though, that's why Bethesda has to give us more options.
---
&gt;stings and things?
---
Yup, that and clean up the goo thing in the valley.
---
I do it, but I can never sell them all.
---
You want harder? Go run around in non-Legendary gear.
---
Burn them all
---
Congrats, now get the clean version
---
or maybe, and stay with me now, some people (such as OP and myself) actually value ethics and doing a job right. I would never want someone like you working for me but I know some contractors that would be HAPPY to work for you.
---
Maybe YOU are the one that is outnumbered....but no that would be some painful self reflection and self awareness.
---
Except I can reduce fallout 4 loot with mods. Can't do it in 76, need Bethesda for that
---
Dumping them feels cheap and at best I just give it to player for free. Selling isn't even an option cause vendors' pathetic 1400 caps won't take much.
---
Sent you a fr

I also think we should get XP for damage done thru out the match or assists downs/kills cause it’s a little frustrating doing 75-90% of the damage and your team gets the down and kill with 1 shot.  
---
I really wish they would focus on making the game more stable by Fixing the lag and crashing. And adding small things like this that would greatly improve the game and make it a lot more fun.
---
Well if there was anything positive to report on they would do that too. It’s not their fault BGS keeps messing up.
---
Wouldn't it be better to balance out the issues with the "OP meta", rather than potentially create new issues by trying implement a defensive perk that counters them?
---
I actually drink then quite consistently and even have mutations that increase the need to eat and drink, but I still get more than I really use.
---
I have a similar item, but thank you for the offer 🙏🏼
---
Yeah he pointed out how Bethesda game studios refuses to acknowledge any problems and/or backlash from the community. They act like everything is OK and downplay any real issues affecting the game.
---
I had this last night, wasn’t -/- for AP but instead I had 462. Special stats were crazy high also, like 52 perception and 45 luck.  No idea how to make this happen on my own terms though.
---
Right. The best. That’s why anyone who voices any opinion y’all don’t like, you ostracize them, insult them, and downvote them into oblivion. Do you realize how cult like this sub is?
---
Aye - I'm wondering if OP and his friend are actually grouped, or if they're just running around together.
---
Wasn’t outdated, literally was just happening.
---
There is lots of positive, they just choose to focus on the negative, just like news stations, pain and suffering = ratings.
---
But that's not the point. The point is that "500+" number itself isn't substantiated in anyway by the writer of the article. If the article(s) said something along the lines that "it stands to reason that a large number of users could be affected", that's a different story. 
---
Even then, though, good journalism doesn't rely on hearsay; nor should the writer of a new article extrapolate or hazard guesses on things like that without providing more evidence. It should be up to the reader to make conclusions based on what was reported, not for the writer to hand feed them you (at least not without indicating that the conclusion reached is the author's own and not a fact).
---
Imagine a headline about a building on fire based on a series of 2-3 minute camera phone videos of people evacuating the building. Its a big building and the videos show lots of people exiting the building, along with sirens and flashing lights.
---
Based on that, a layman might assume that this is a big deal. A layman might think something like "100s of People Running for their Lives in Downtown Building Fire!" 
---
But a journalist is not a layman. They are expected to report on what they can prove. Moreover, a journalist is expected to dig and not just trust what is presented to them. A journalist would find out that this is just a plain old fire drill;  a real journalist might discover the videos were recorded during a national holiday and the building was largely empty at the time of the incident. 
---
Even without doing any serious investigating beyond the videos, a real journalist would attempt the substantiate the claims made in them. They may realize that each video is just the same 20ish people exiting the building, shot from different angles by different people over the course the same 5 minute period. 
---
Bottom line being that nothing in the videos confirm without doubt that there actually is a fire, or that is affected "100s" or people. The evidence available doesn't show that, so to say so (even if its probable or damn likely) is not factual. This kind of reporting leads to misinformation. 
---
The issue of course is that this sort of reporting is boring. Sensational  and catchy headlines are fun; but the reality that everyday life is pretty mundane is not.
---
Nah I just have 10 purifiers at my camp and collect more than enough to max out my vendor and also replace stimpacks (in fact the water ends up being just as good if not better with health regen). 
---
50 caps every visit to camp while playing and fill my stash, always have around 400 odd spare by the time I need to sell again. 
---
5 caps each at vendors means 280 water. Leaves 120 over and I use around 20-30 during SBQ. 
---
Top tip really.
---
By giving more information, details, and opposing points of view? Geez. Y’all be chugging the koolaid in here.
---
Dude my weapons aren't even legendary and the game is still ez lmao.
---
They do have a known issues and bug page on their official forum webpage. I can guarantee you that almost every thing that people complain about is on that list if it's legit and not fixed yet. 
---
So people who say they don't acknowledge bugs and issues are misleading.
---
Do you read their articles they put out? They frequently refernece the community and how "vocal" it is.
---
I use mutations so it would have to be rad shield, although if you stack enough rad resist effects through your gear a nuke zone stops becoming so... dangerous
---
Welcome to fallout 76 subreddit.
---
I'm saying the finer details hardly matter when noticing something as absurd as what's transpired last week. yeah, they forgot to mention Bethesda already patched it. the article isn't entirely accurate. but that's not the point in the first place, is it? if a dumpster is on fire because of a nuclear blast, its color or when it was put out hardly matter. the real news is that something so outlandish could actually happen.
---
and I don't think they mentioned Bethesda was tipped off of both hacks a week in advance, either, for that matter. so what about Bethesda and their appalling incompetence? because that's hurting the game way more than some throwaway article on a dying news outlet.
---
&gt;There have been over a thousand bug fixes.
---
yeah, things that shouldn't have gotten past the beta. things that existed since Fo4. things that were fixed by modders ages ago. things that take 5 minutes in the CK to fix. in the same vein, it's hardly worth mentioning.
---
Just got it I'm on my private world
---
I'm glad we agree.
---
Got any bloodied melee weapons for trade?
---
I wont. I wont edit it for you so you can grasp it better :)
---
Join my party we have a full team
---
&gt; but to severely punish those (upto and including hardware bans) for who have been using said inventory exploit to do nothing but to be malicious towards others who have spent hundreds of hours in Appalachia.
---
Yeah then those people will just say they were wrongly punished just like every other time.
---
Breaking news - reddit creating baseless cynics - oh the humanity! 
---
Idealogue. That's funny. Pedantic. Oh, it most certainly is that, friendo.
---
I just got fo76 for Christmas!
---
I've been in this sub since the game came out but just didnt have the spare money to buy it. Then with all the bad press it just wasnt a priority. 
---
Its 100% because of this sub &amp; all the nice posts that I told my husband it was what I wanted for christmas this year. I'm like 0% of the way through (seriously, level 1 and just a minute ago placed a camp). I hope I meet some of the friendly people like in this sub on my travels.
---
there's four of them around the "dance floor" :)
---
But the information is wrong more often than not lol, if you want a good youtuber who reports on everything good and bad look up Juicehead, he actually gives the news regardless if it's good or bad. Also I dunno if you can really have opposing points of view when reporting on the news. It's just bad journalism to let bias affect news
---
Lead lined all the way. Keep a regular bag for extra weight (or work up to high capacity) once you get the big rad resistance everything is one or two rads. Game changer in a subtle way
---
If plastic is what you want then just go to Vault-Tec High School.
---
Join my world
---
Your suggested fix would give them a legit perk that allows them to do this without an exploit...   
---
9 point endurance card?
---
&gt;Maybe YOU are the one that is outnumbered
---
I don't think so considering these people still have a job. pretty sure it's the other way around. but I digress.
---
let's assume you're right. let's say they publish an apology and edit the original article to reflect the truth and nothing but the truth. does that make the whole situation any less ridiculous or Fo76 any less of a dumpster fire?
---
no, it most definitely does not. the status quo remains the same, the game is still a joke. but now with an addendum.
---
whoopty doo.
---
“If I ever got bored...”
---
So 95%+ of your play time was spent building like mine was?
---
I liked the game and just played it again a few weeks ago but damn does the story fall flat in its delivery and damn is the world lack lustre
---
Are you able to invite me
---
I like west tek because its also a lot if steel, and usually 1-3 legendary mobs.
---
I also had to switch routers and restart my ps4 I invited you to a different group chat
---
Ok and how is their information wrong? Even people like Jim Sterling (who has in this communities eyes, has “shit on fallout”) has openly said many times that he would be the first to praise BGS when the do something right. For example if the Wastelanders update goes smoothly and doesn’t break the game. Maybe you are only focusing on the negative and not looking at the positives in their reporting. Everything is perspective mate.
---
I need holiday presents please anyone :(
---
Oh you're right. I'm going to stop playing this game forever now. Thank you for saving me.
---
I don’t have to be a helicopter pilot to know that if I see one stuck in a tree, someone fucked up. 
---
Same for FO76. You act like just because we’re not all super invested in it and praising it for every little thing or willing to put up with their shit MTX and monetization, that our opinions are any less valid than yours. They aren’t.
---
No, despite the description, *diluted* Rad-X doesn't suppress mutations.
---
I would suggest your first backpack be the one that suits your build. Imho the refrigerator is a waste esp if ure running carnivore.
---
My main a bloodied (of course 🤷🏼‍♂️) and with high str I wasn’t in need of the HC mod. I went with Lead lined since it was a huge turn around for me fighting SBQ. No need for radshield after that.
---
My point is pick the one that will help along your biggest in game nuisance
---
Yeah but I hate that 🤪
---
You’re being just as toxic mate. Take a good look in the mirror.
---
that's cool and all but you completely ignored everything I said. the "truth" wouldn't really change the status quo.
---
Santatron has been my biggest hindrance to defense lately. But it's possible that my turrets are part of the "war on Christmas" because they also occasionally begin attacking the large Christmas tree near Santatron as well.
---
Ummm, most all of them post follow up videos when required.
---
I was surprised and disappointed the pre builds from 4 weren’t available but yeah I’m at the point where I’ve shrunk my house to a tiny 3x3 2 story complete with a garage. Limited amount of lighting and defenses.
---
Are you talking about at the base of the tree? That one is a large creature spawn (deathclaws, fog crawlers, hermit crabs, and such); though still probably the best place to look.
---
I don't play anymore, because it's a garbage game.
---
With FO 1st and the atom shop plus game sales its easy to say this game is far from dying anytime soon. Ive played daily for over a year and have at least ten friends that do too. Not counting all the other people on my friends list that I trade with more than I play with but still see all of their names daily. Haters can hate all they want. It isn't going to slow us down one bit.
---
250 Stimpacks at something like 10 caps apiece is just a little over two days worth of selling.
---
It really does feel to me that they're failing to meet a demand on this one. There've been many signs in the last year that at least the vocal players really want more from the camp system and more assets. 
---
That said, Wastelanders being such a PVE-centric update could mean it will also bring some of the changes we want for camps. I'm going to see what happens over the next 3 months and assess from there what my expectations are for the game and what I'm willing to put into it in 2020.
---
Awesome gift 👍
---
I was on yesterday when they " ended" the event. Went to buy paper, none. Stopped by the tinker bench, no gift option available. I think wrapping paper will not be usable, after the event. Of course, Beth has not even tried to make this clear, so who knows.
---
&gt;Who do you think we're trying to appease by telling news outlets and YouTubers to be accurate? 
---
this sub? Bethesda? I don't know, nobody else seems to care.
---
and you'd be right *if* they were overblowing the situation in order to appease outrage culture. but my point this whole time has been that this is one of the rare instances where the outrage is 100% justified.
---
There is a wealth of positive.  
---
Its not my job to do your research for you.  
---
There are plenty of posts of positive 76 experiences here.  Even more in Filthy Casuals.
---
If you open your eyes, you will see them.
---
The negative narrative around the game is so overblown, that the true state of the game is not visible to people on the outside of our community. Even Gopher, who is primarily Bethesda letsplayer and tends to defend some Bethesda decisions ends up misinformed about the game, which means he has less desire to try out the game (released) than he should have...
---
Bethesda deserves flak for the shit they HAVE done... but at least 50% of the online narrative is stuff they EVEN HAVEN'T done. Just look at the youtube videos for F76 "news" they use footage from the release version, the most buggy version to further deepen the narrative about how buggy the game is...
---
Do you have your own opinions, or is your only argument regurgitating someone elses biased point of view and trying to claim it as your own.
---
SHEEP!!!!
---
Not blueprints as their system sucks and you can’t place them anywhere except floating houses.
---
Instead just sell whole camps...of course someone will troll and just keep building and selling on the same spot lol.
---
"And off the bow we see the internet neckbeard sea lion"
---
Sealioning (also spelled sea-lioning and sea lioning) is a type of trolling or harassment which consists of pursuing people with persistent requests for evidence or repeated questions, while maintaining a pretense of civility and sincerity.
---
Is the raider gas mask that's vaulting even on sale? That's the same price as the other one unless I'm mistaken.
---
I have a vampires .50 MG, it's great. (no spin up, better for when you are switching to Vamp for regen during a fight). That said, my (not even perked-for-it) Vampires Combat Shotgun seems to work better for healing. It's the first time I've intentionally put a scope on a shotty, as even sniping for 1+1+1+1+1 dmg give you 5 regen procs.  I find it particularly useful at the usual group events where I don't want to be one-shotting stuff, but want to stay in the pocket (One Violent Night, Uranium Fever, Surface to Air, Line in the Sand, etc).
---
"If I can't win I am gonna take my ball and go HOME!"
---
Question. How does a bestheda fanboy defend his/her purchase?
---
Answer: they can't. The game is full of bugs and outlandish microtransactions
---
Yup, I'm seeing a pattern here.
---
I bought it last year..
---
The lake shore near thunder mountain.   The swamp is flat, has lots of water, and the view is nice across the lake.   The Mire is a bit of an acquired taste but it is quite pretty.
---
Like 4 years old?
---
Yea
---
Cool story bro
---
That wasn't the hate train. Those were the people that didn't want fallout as a multiplayer game, which is a legitimate complain for them.
---
The actual, justified hate began on launch.
---
You still play it. That is an enigma of life itself. It's the pure question of how and why would someone do this?
---
Needs more nuance.
---
Some kind of weather warning for general trollery from people who just get their info from YouTube probably a good idea also.
---
there's nothing to win if the other guy won't play. it's like the special olympics.
---
You commented cuz you feel attacked
---
All you want to do is argue lol you can dress your shit argument up as much as you want but it won't change the fact it's a shit argument. You have been defending racism and proven yourself to be a racist but you conveniently deleted the comment where you admit to using racial slurs daily lmao.
---
high cap for me..
---
more carry weight is the only reason I slogged through to get it when most of the challenges were still broken...
---
It is. 
---
Dont believe all the press.
---
Learn mods by scapping levers. When scrapping, have low health and a full set of unyeilding armor to increase you intelligence.  There are also bobbleheads and magazines which you can use for intelligence and increase materials when  scrapping.
---
Why are you even subscribed to this sub if you hate fo76 so much? Seems to me like you are dumb
---
Woah. Your parents are either really chill or pretty absent. Reminds me of playing games like death race as a kid.
---
Do you have a faction preference?
---
Just felt like feeding the troll I guess. I bought it right after release, haven't played it for a few months.
---
And the unjustified hate began when kotaku described it as a rust clone, some didnt want multiplayer, ok thats fine, others just didnt want it to be a rust clone since rust is without a doubt the most toxic online community there is, so seeing that thisnwas a "rust clone" just made them start hating everything about it
---
&gt; you conveniently deleted the comment where you admit to using racial slurs daily lmao
---
I didn't. but I'll say it again, just in case: I admit to using racial slurs daily lmao
---
That's a tough call, I don't advocate "nerfing" anything, it usually creates additional problems. Fireproof gives a counter that isn't OP, is already in the game, and would require a perk investment to take.
---
If someone disarms them the budget they take up will remain till you relog
---
And the other thought brought up was a log cabin building set. In a post apocalyptic world it's fairly easy to build a log cabin, so it wouldn't be out of place in FO76.
---
I bought it last summer for $17 and have only played it for 450 hours since then. I've got my cost down below $0.04 per hour, so I guess it is probably worth it.
---
Lol.  Quick scroll through your history reveals someone who thinks it’s edgy to pop pills and brag about it, is a 21 year old virgin and needs some female PS4 friends to play fortnite with.
---
If you look real close, you can almost see the credibility off in the distance....
---
Hey, you have the new lights. Do they go diagonally like in the news page picture?
---
What a class act you are, real productive member of society I'm sure. It's really easy to be a bigot when you are anonymous online so I'm not surprised at all you share you're simple minded opinions on here.
---
&gt;...I don't advocate "nerfing" anything...
---
I mean, based on your description in this post it sounds like the problem is people taken advantage of unintended consequences of something. I wouldn't call removing those unintended consequences "nerfing", just...fixing things.
---
(Note: I don't really play nuclear winter much and don't really know the systems that surround it all that well.)
---
So some of that I agree with, but people expressing their frustration with Bethesda being incompetent when their actions show a level of incompetence is hardly toxic.
---
Like if it were just a small minor thing I am with you, but we have seen way worse than that at times.
---
People who trash on the people enjoying the game though, totally with you.
---
But quite a bit of that isn't automatically stemming from hate either. We can't realistically just assume it is hate.
---
It is ironic that the typical audience on these articles hits out at Fallout 76 players for "buying what ever Bethesda throws them", on a site where they buy whatever nonsense the author writes for them.
---
Lmao no. Thats probably close to 100%
---
We're definitely grouped. I'm just a long range sniper and he's a melee build, so we're not holding hands while we fight. There are a lot of times he gets no loot for my kills, even though he's right on top of the mobs that die.
---
Bethesda fanboys are so fucking sensitive Jesus christ
---
Yes the same plans come from the crafted ones as from the ones you get from scorched
---
i think the vendor in Camden park also sells the plan
---
You purposefully jumped in front of people shooting to get them killed?
---
Yes to kill them and get caps
---
It’s part of he game
---
I got one, too!
---
That's pretty trolly
---
They can go on passive
---
Yes pleeeeease!!!!
---
Still trolling. You can try to justify it all you want but you are a troll
---
Yea everyone who pvps does it
---
Yes they fixed it yesterday. Just killed a couple of scorch santas too PS4.
---
Too much green stuff. They like to go swimming in the West Tek Research Center vats and such. Shame really...
---
wow.....I was just messing with you man. You don't have to insult YOURSELF that way......
---
...unless you made ANOTHER mistake of logic by saying that I wasn't competing (meaning that only you were) and then comparing it to the special olympics (therefore you were the only person IN the special olympics) or were you VERY awkwardly trying to insult me by comparing me to special olympic athletes who probably accomplish more every day than folks like you who insult them will in their entire lives.
---
I’m not destroying bases or fallowing it’s in the game
---
dongyea
---
Oh I didn't know that! That's awesome!
---
Purposefully getting people killed without actually engaging them is trolling. If you want to kill people maybe shoot them?
---
I’ve been having a lot of luck at Morgantown airport. I only run the interior of it and server hop.
---
no we dont.
---
I only do that when they won’t fight I don’t only do it to low levels though I did it to a 297 I’m a 167 and they both fought me as well after and before hand
---
Bought at full price and now about 1300hours in - it’s def worth.
---
OP
---
Nope unfortunately.
---
I doubt unyielding will ever be fixed as its such an OP armour effect already
---
Well most pvpers I know do and RageChronicles
---
Agree that it seems like the plans are independent of where you got the gift.
---
However, it seems to me that the small Scorchy Clause gifts are more likely not to have a plan than the crafted ones. Anybody else noticed this?
---
So forcing people into pvp who actively aren't trying to pvp and you don't think that's trolling?
---
I meant to say it doesn't really matter who wins when debating a mentally handicapped person, you just look autistic.
---
and considering you can't grasp basic concepts such as argumentation I better just quit while I'm ahead.
---
Glassed Caverns.  
---
Clear it, then mine some ultracite.  They respawn.  Clear it again. 
---
Rinse Repeat Profit
---
Sort of they can stop me by going on passive and I tell them that as well people do it to me as well
---
Sounds like you hang out with a bunch of assholes.
---
What is RageChronicles?  Is this some sort of asshole only subreddit where PVP trolls hang out and share their stories of greifing?
---
"oThEr PeOpLe Do iT" that doesn't mean it's right?
---
Sometimes Bethesda puts fixes without anyone knowing
---
That’s how it works. Small gifts have a chance to have a plan. Medium will have one. Large will have one and a chance to have more than one.
---
Just the usual shit about you having to be a Bethesda shill to say you like it. Personally I use to love the game when it first came out don’t really play it anymore but no one should put someone down over enjoying something
---
You may be right.  Didn’t think about that but it makes sense.  Back when the game launched there would be many a nite where I was the only one on the world because of the time zone I’m in HST.
---
Big bend tunnel is quite good for them.
---
You should do Collision Course while you are there, guaranteed 25 Scorched spawn that come running to you. I usually get anywhere from 2-5 Gift boxes each time.
---
I don’t justify it if other people do it I know that I can’t get banned because many pvpers could get banned I don’t scam and people scam and don’t get banned
---
So my paddle ball isnt the weakest :)
---
You WERE using Special Olympics as an insult? Lol wow I didn't think that you would actually openly admit that! 
---
Yes ABSOLUTELY start practicing giving head. I fully support sex worker legalization and your repartee game is atrocious.
---
Well I'm sure plenty of people will start reporting you now
---
PvP is when both sides aggrees to do it. if you use a tweak to force the other side in unsollicited PvP, you are trolling. this is not enough to get banned, it is just screwing the fun of others.
---
No a pvp youtuber he is a good guy he may make people mad but he gives away guns and armor to his viewers
---
Yeah but the waves can be kinda slow and I’m impatient lol.
---
You may want to check those time/date stamps, kid. Bethesda had already acknowledged and addressed the hack **before** YongYea uploaded his video.
---
You openly admit to griefing and think its ok game etiquette because you wont get banned?
---
You sir are a peice of work.
---
I will make it a point of personal satisfaction to nuke your base whenever I see you in game.
---
Definitely worth it. You just have to accept it for what it is. It's a buggy mess, but very fun. 
---
Best enjoyed with others.
---
What did I do that allows me to be banned
---
Well, it's not too far from the truth, is it? You can build a base in the fallout universe, there isn't much else to do. The game is riddled with bugs and glitches, the AI is dumb as fuck, social features are misding, the graphics are ridiculous for a 2018 release from a AAA-Developer, the monetization is absolutly greedy and disgusting with a lot of stuff being paywalled that should be in the game and bethesda broke countless promises. The game deserves all the hate it gets. 
---
Why do people still defend this shithole of a game? 
---
I me
---
Agreed but i should think that if they made changes to the vault 94 armour, they'd announce it to try and get more people into raiding
---
That's awesome.  How did you get your floors to be suspended with only beams and not stairs?
---
I just want to understand what people consider trolling and why people hate pvp
---
This. Also, be sure to hit the two fissures while you're in the area.
---
Good guys dont purposefully try to ruin someone elses day. 
---
Those people are called bullies.
---
I don’t think it is anything to fix. I don’t like it but it is all part of the Raider mentality. They are assholes doing asshole things. Gotta keep your head on a swivel and always wear PA at someone’s camp. It helps with the fall.
---
This isn’t grieving. Not even close.
---
What should bethesda fix? Its your own fault if you walk into a room full of fucking punji boards.
---
I never said I was a good guy no one is perfect you can go on passive, ignore me, block me, or switch severs
---
people consider an attempt to force someone into a situation they do not want to be in trolling or greifing. 
---
Forcing someone to PVP you when they dont want to is the text book definition of fallout greifing. 
---
Continuing to attack, harass, and disrupt someone elses gameplay is the text book definition of fallout greifing.
---
You are a greifer.  No justification you can provide will change the communities view of you.
---
Yeah, those repair kits really ruined the game.
---
Yeah let me just change how I'm currently playing the game because you can't grow up and leave people alone
---
No, im going to nuke your base.  Then follow you around killing you all day.  Since you like to PVP, I will bring real PVPers with me.  
---
I hope you use all your caps first, because soon they will be ours.
---
Yup, this is the best place. Plus mobs are high level so you get decent XP.
---
Ok I accept that but then most of pvp would be trolling and greifing
---
Many players focus on how much damage a weapon does with one hit.  But in this game it’s damage per second that matters.  So, how much damage a given weapon does over 30 seconds, or one minute, for instance, including reload time.   
---
In this way of thinking, the single shot pistols in 76 just suck.  Can they hit hard?  Well, sorta, yes, one slow shot at a time.  And good luck with stealth.  
---
The only two pistols I’ve had all around good luck with were the bloodied 10mm and pipe pistols.  These two are boosted the most by vats criticals, so the more criticals the better.  Explosive and faster fire rate are ok, but just don’t output the same damage as criticals over a period of several magazines.   
---
In my opinion, legendary effects that boost vats and criticals on automatic pistols are more important than others effects.  I’m also sure someone else will experience the game from an entirely different point of view, lol.
---
Then by that you’re a greifing me
---
I don't want to pvp unless I enter nuclear winter
---
Honestly bro it’s kind of on you if you choose to walk down a long corridor of punji boards.
---
The easiest way to stop is to ignore or go on passive which don’t change how you play
---
You are an ass, but I can't see that getting you banned
---
That’s a battle royal by pvp I mean in adventure
---
Sucks to get a taste of your own medicine doesnt it.
---
Yes, I plan on griefing you.  
---
Rules of the wasteland.  If you are going to grief, then expect to be griefed back.
---
I am but yea that’s not a reason to be banned
---
Mine is working OK (PS4).
---
Been using it a lot lately as I‘ve been helping out new/low level players around Morgantown - (its the only weapon I still have that isn’t one hit kill)
---
How did you get out of the vault without getting to level 2?
---
Store your junk
---
I dont think i would lump trap bases in with griefing bc they are not actively doing anything to annoy, harrass, or bully. You went to their camp, its within their right to build and defend as they want.
---
If anything i would say this is raider  rp done correctly.
---
Sucks you lost your junk though.
---
Ok I’m fine with if you are up for sealthboys and tesla I’ll fight I can die a million times and still go to bed with a smile on my face
---
Glassed Cavern.  Then mine an ultracite vein to respawn them.  We were literally walking on meat piles.  Nothing like it.
---
Glassed cavern hasnt been working for me wtf.
---
or a copy of fo4 for when we wanna avoid hacks
---
Don't walk into a house built of punji boards.
---
im not going to attack you openly, that would be stupid on my part.  People like you dont play fair, so I wont.
---
Im going to grief you with nukes.
---
If that doesnt work, DDOS will.
---
There’s a gentleman on YouTube that goes by the name “lorespade” I believe that posts many videos of his trap base victims.
---
Cool?
---
All criticism of the established topic of Fallout 76 shall be met with greater personal criticism. That is the way
---
My only complaint is spending 1400 or so caps for high quality gift wrap and repeatedly getting molerat heads....
---
On Xbox it’s still good I just did it this morning!
---
I can just move the base you know that right
---
Good, you will be spending your time hopping around the map instead of griefing others. 
---
This is the same theory I use when India calls me pretending to be the IRS.
---
Jesus. You must be fun
---
I can sever hop
---
Didn’t say you should stop playing it. If you are enjoying it I am legit happy for you. In fact anyone who can get enjoyment from it can and should continue to do so. But don’t jump down my throat because I refuse to do the same. I’ve loved BGS since the day I got my 360, Oblivion was my first real RPG experience and I’ve loved them ever since. I am not happy with where the company is today and the things they’ve done with FO76. Did you ever stop to think that the people who are the angriest, are that way because they love it so much and want it to be better?
---
I can follow
---
what you don’t wanna run a furious pipe rifle build?
---
Omg, That’s just wow. I wonder what they get out of that.
---
Collision course mabye?
---
I play offline
---
Gauley mine and Morgantown airport.
---
Just assholes being assholes.
---
I'll try that for sure thanks.
---
Omg, I worked really hard getting where I am right now. That would be really boring.
---
I wish I could try it!
---
Since that doesnt exist.  Good luck. 
---
Fo76 is online only. 
---
Unless you mean you will  play Fallout 4 instead. 
---
In which case, mission accomplished,  your not griefing.
---
Not more fucking punji boards WTF.
---
Thank you.
---
There are some people who think any amount of criticism about a thing they enjoy is tantamount to being assaulted. And others who think any minor inconvenience suffered while playing a game is the equivalent to being financially ravaged. There is no in between
---
Just store your junk, why is this so hard to do.
---
Traps are part of thos game, fucking entitled carebears are trying to nerf everything.
---
 This is the wasteland after all
---
Awesome man, my wife got me one for my birthday earlier in the year. Love it.
---
I like u
---
Bolton greens, Morgantown airport, Morgantown high school, and the train yard.
---
Go a bit south, and find Arktos pharma.   usually a few there (just don’t get in the elevator to the basement).
---
I made a thred on this last week. It's just the handmade. I think it has to do with their armor penetration. I noticed it after they "reverted" their 250 DR while reloading not fix. Pretty sure they broke something else, but I haven't put my finger on it yet. (might also be with the assault rifle)
---
Got it. Thanks a lot.
---
I’m fulling expecting the update to be 40-60gb
---
I'm totally out of the loop, havent played in months, what's this hack that peopel are doing?
---
I'd have paid caps for those.
---
I'm kinda tired of repeating the argument but... blah blah, slippery slope, blah blah, fo1st exclusive items only available with real money, yadda yadda.
---
Ah yes I forgot, this is Mild Appalachia. Do whatever the carebears say!
---
if someone wants to go though all the effort of making a trap base, they have earned whatever junk i was careless enough not to store
---
2685 hours played since November 2018. Fallout 76 is pretty pretty pretty good.
---
Morgntown Airport 100% for noobies !
---
The Galleria has high level scorched, I've had 2-3 per run
---
How does it work do you shoot the target or lob a grenade? How do work?
---
Only real annoying experience was when I was level 20 or something and 3 level 100+ players starting stalking me around Grafton trying to start PvP. I fast traveled back to my CAMP once I finished what I was doing only for them to follow me. From there they started shooting up me and my house so I just quit the server only for them to start spamming me with party chat invites. 
---
I rarely ever run into issues like this on anything save for the occasional hate message from when I’m playing battlefield, gears or siege. For the most part my time with this community has been great. Tons of kind people who are willing to lend a hand.
---
Consumable freezes happen to me daily. It scares me into not using anything until I absolutely have to. I hate it. 
---
If I am learning plans I don't know yet and it freezes after learning a few.. I log back in to see I don't have those plans now and the ones I'd learned just before the freeze are now not fucking known... So I'm pretty sure I've been fucked outta a few plans like this. Even going slow AF doesn't save me from the freeze sometimes. Been like this a long time and been hearing this is an issue on my end for the duration. Would love to see this fixed.
---
I don't put traps and shit at my camp and have visited quite a few trap camps...those things stand out like a sore thumb man.  Just have some common sense and take in your surroundings, those things are easy to spot.  I would never build a trap base myself but when I find one I take it as a challenge to see if I can get through it, it's fun and the worst that happens is I have to respawn.  Like others have said don't carry junk you want to keep, pretty simple. It's not really greifing, you walked right into it because you weren't paying attention to your surroundings.
---
I’ve got plenty of my own opinions. But how do you think one gathers information and forms their own opinions? 9/10 times it’s coming from another person or source. All sources are slanted one way or another. So what you do, and follow me here, is you absorb all sources and then that helps you formulate your own opinion. And guess what, two people can come to the exact same conclusion without having ever used the same sources. Wow what a concept.
---
You overpaid.
---
Now you've got me wondering--I'm not sure if it's just the aid menu, or plans from the notes menu too?  I know that it's not just the menu, since I've gotten in from hot-keyed stims and radaway.  I think I've even gotten it from an auto-stim legendary armor piece stimming me.
---
That's right - there is no guarantee of a good drop. I got some good drops early ( mothman ) from normal gifts and bought a few from vendors. Got a couple of good ones from handmade gifts but don't want to blow too many caps. Bit of a mix of farming methods. Now I mainly just open gifts from the santatron.
---
I'd probably consider 120-150 to be the threshold.
---
My problem is you don't have any extractors, that place has 1 aluminum, 1 steel and at least 1 junk in view, why not use them
---
There was another spot to the west of where the Prime Cuts event was in the Mire that would also typically have a Sloth.
---
I don't go to Tanagra Town that often, so for me, I think it has always been a Sloth.
---
200 or more
---
I would still be hesitant to say it crashes the whole server because I never get randomly disconnected, and assuming you're right then I would expect it to happen when other people trigger the crash?
---
Look up Captainoob’s stealth commando build on YouTube. It’s top notch. I used most of it for my first bloodied commando build. She could kill anything with a quickness by the time she hit level 60.
---
Incorrect. The easiest way is for you to not troll at all. And forcing me to go into a menu to change something does... Wait for it... Change how I play
---
No, the mods did.
---
You're assuming it wasn't deliberately set up that way.
---
This has been debunked multiple times. Intelligence does not effect the rate at which you learn mods, only the amount of scrap produced from breaking down the items. It is completely random chance whether you learn a mod or not, you can use intelligence boosts and mentats to get more scrap, but it doesn’t help with actually learning the mods.
---
DJ Sallygaster and the Lords of Acid in the house!
---
I thought that as well, but only having played for 6 months, I'm almost 200 and don't feel that's high. I'd say more like 300+, that's some serious commitment to this game for a lot of hours.
---
No but you see I wasn't making a factual assertion, I was just calling you stupid. You made a falsifiable and extremely wrong factual assertion. It's different.
---
I've been noticing this a lot recently. The stats seem all over the place, for no reason at all.
---
What platform are you on?
---
Okay thanks, when I get home I’ll have to see if I got my budget back. Still sad people can disarm them, they really take the camp to a new level.
---
That’s bad ass... I’m jealous
---
I think that happens when the server is slow to respond. It depends not only in your end but also the stability of others clients connected to the server.
---
Amazon servers are distributed around the world but maybe... Are you from a remote place?
---
I don't have the CTD for consuming aid items. In a public world that can be because you are connected with somebody from the other side of the world.
---
In a private world I only can imagine a bad ISP.
---
Of course, you are right. Bethesda need a better service from Amazon. But this technology have limits.
---
I'm talking about a lockup, not a disconnect.  Disconnects are way rarer for me.  It's at least a 10:1 ratio, if not more.
---
But as far as other people go, I've had this happen a couple times now on a private server too, where I lock up, my teammate locks up, and when we both end task and try to get back into that "world" we can't.  On public servers, it varies more.
---
I consider myself high level. Currently Level 397 on XB, never glitched, duped, or anything. Just farm a hell of a lot. Don’t do NW either. Not into PvP. I believe I have 1350 hours in game, but could be off by a bit. I also don’t have multiple characters or builds. Same build since Level 25 (TH melee). I have one Level 3 character that I only use to hold excess caps from higher value sales. Love the game. That’s about it.
---
Yeah - me too.  Always carry it for emergencies so I don't get stuck somewhere.
---
I agree.  I'm pretty sure I've been on servers with friends who crash out from this bug and the server never stopped running from my perspective.
---
Thanks! You change the supporting walls to doors and you will be able to remove them. It’s sort of trial and error and if you make a mistake you’ll have to support everything again to edit anything but it does work. Try it in a workshop so you can just start again when everything goes wrong haha :)
---
&gt; Except it's not a village in China
---
Is this a reference to something?
---
wheres a good place to look for trades? 
---
i have a bloodied handmade ffr vats cost, looking for junkies swing speed bat / sledge / super sledge
---
i smell a nukashine trap!
---
&gt; This issue is that journalism sites aren't accurate. If there is an issue, which there always is, why do they have to make up false statements, or not get the issues right?
---
They did get the issue right though, OP is just mad that they didn't say it was patched out.  They never said it was unpatchable, they were for the most part just quoting actual user's issues from here about it
---
lol that’s horrible, geez i hope that never happens to me
---
depends on your level. If you don't sweat the odd scorchbeast then any fissure. Same thing as glassed caverns but less moving around. In fact you can build a base or tent there for comfort, but don't use turrets as you want to be the oone to kill the scorched. Mine ONE ultracite, cull wave, repeat.
---
You launch yourself onto pressure plates that are halfway thru the wall which trigger a flamethrower that breaks the chair and drops you in the water :)
---
True CTDs are rare for me--I get a lock up instead.  The only fix is to force close from the task manager.  Usually blind.
---
I'm in Portland, OR, so not even remotely remote.  But I have noticed that when I used to play with some folks who were in very remote places around the world (one used mobile data!), server stability would suffer.  Especially during Scorched Earth.  The lockup I suffer the most, is often when very little else is happening in the game.  Hanging around my camp crafting, need some water, BAM.  Hanging around my camp opening christmas presents, BAM.
---
Oh man, would love to find a stash like that!  My Quad Faster Fire rate Combat rifle chews through .38.  You prob made someone’s day for sure.
---
Me too, but private servers seem different.  And worse.  (Thanks Bugthesda!)
---
You KNOW s/he put that shit up on their vendor for 1c.
---
Ok, not so fast there. I've seen this homie's videos before, and he does pretty good. I don't have any fancy videos, but...
---
...here's my first complaint on this; there is shadowed for leather torso. I'm using it. My set right now that I've been happy with for a while is 3 pieces of leather and 2 pieces of raider. The torso is shadowed and the left leg, but the right arm is studded. I did this combination to reach a minimum of 250 dr/er each. But I also have harder to detect on the leather leg and the leather arm. Since the arm isn't shadowed not studded, it shouldn't affect sneak. I tested in the nuke silo with the ceiling turrets. 3\* sneak, escape artist, and two pieces of harder to detect. If I took off the arm the turrets would eventually find me. So after months of this set up I believe the effect stacks. But I'm also only using it on leather pieces. So if shadowed only stacks on leather, then maybe the legendary effect only stacks on leather.
---
Was gonna nuke WS later anyway, so I'll try to test it again. But I swear I notice a difference when I swap that studded leather arm for a forrest scout arm without harder to detect.
---
I am the mothman, you are the walrus
---
Would you be willing to take a junkie limb damage and faster reload for your handmade
---
It was a confirmed bug.
---
I like Lewis and Sons or the Dirt ˇTrack, but anywhere east of the map, Point Pleasant, Dirt Track, Mogran Town, Morgan Town Railyard etc
---
Yeah, that are servers issues. I just don't get why are they so inconsistent from user to user.
---
I have it ! am on Xbox in the UK it's bedtime now but I am on daily, grinding.nuclear winter at the mo but drop me.a.message and I will log on for you tomorrow gt Just junior boy
---
Will do.  GT is LawngNose, I’ll send you a message now.
---
Thanks.
---
Yeah, they have been pushing people to do the raids. Heck they even gave it 600 vault steal , which I'm still frustrated about .
---
I have played since Beta and am closing in on 300.
---
 Also have two alts close to 50 for mule and purveyor purposes only.
---
As a level 380, I'd say 250 starts "high level"
---
But there is also a point in "higher levels" that arent true high level. 
---
By this I mean there is a point it's less believable or sweaty (for lack of a better term). I think those in the 600+ category, for the age of the game, are in a diluted group of "true grinders". I think the super high guys have to share the honor with those who used xp glitches. But that's just my personal view.
---
This guy right here :P
---
I’d say 200 and not sure why high is considered exploit.  WS ghouls before the XP nerf were huge XP and back then you could stack int for 2% xp per INT, and still can.
---
I’m on Xbox u can collect the plans buddy
---
That’s one that I regularly sell. 299 is my normal price, but I’ll do my standard Reddit discount. 
---
Might be on later tonight, but otherwise sometime this weekend. 
---
You can PM me your gamertag if you want.
---
Lol no...now I wanna build a trap base.
---
There actually is. One can be upset about changes and not be toxic. There's a huge problem with the mindset these days. No one has respect for others any more it seems.
---
Pmed you.
---
Last night I saw a Lvl. 45 Vengeful Mothman on the edge of a cliff. He was looking out at the land below him and I was studying him a good hundred feet or so away (I'm only lvl 25) his back was turned to me. Suddenly he disappeared into thin air...and re-appeared a few feet in front of me with huge yellow glowing eyes. I promptly freaked the F out and charged back to White springs for safety. Things get freaky out in Appalachia.
---
200+, from personal experience, you dont fully flesh out your build, and optimize with all the correct perks and items till at least 200.  You are basically still learning at this point.  
---
There are exceptions to this rule, as there are exceptions to everything.
---
Before this point, you havent had a chance to pick up all the QoL situational perks that you will need to truely be Endgame.
---
It’s the cards there intermittent have been for a few days it’s super annoying
---
You're actually harming the game by attacking those who criticize it. It's because of gamers like you, that Bethesda continues their lax and unprofessional attitude.
---
They aren't lying. The info is simply outdated.
---
Why are you so upset about these supposed lies, and not the lies you paid for?
---
Moralizing is your entire goal here. Only you somehow managed to ignore the worst offender and went after some dumb article that frankly, changed no one's minds about ever touching this game. Bethesda already put a bullet in this game back in 2018.
---
If you're willing to continue making Bethesda rich despite their lies about how good the game is, you don't get to complain when someone lies in a way that makes the game look bad.
---
It's an online game so everyone involed in the killing of a given enemy gets a random weapon. The enemies will drop the type of weapon they use (ranged, melee or unarmed) but not that specific one.
---
I have been a believer in the moth man as a young boy. My wife and I recently moved out to West va to start reaching lore and folk story's to start a pod cast using the mothman as a jumping off point. Also I have a large mothman tattoo taking up much of my left fore arm haha. All hail the mighty mothman!
---
I mean, there are times I kill things to find they don’t have any loot on them. I’m not sure every mob gives loot.
---
Depending on how many caps you have lots are selling the holiday gifts now too.  I have a bunch in my vendor currently.  The large and medium seem to sell the fastest.
---
Tell me wendigo. Tell me wendigo. Tell me wendigoooooo DUMBDUMBDUMBDUMB 
---
Dang that's  7 hours a day if you played every day for over a year. Just roughly rounding
---
High level = 420
---
Some light criticism on occasion does nothing when you continue to give them money and talk up the game, while downplaying problems, which you know damn well is the climate of this sub. The fact that most of my posts have been downvoted in disagreement is evidence enough of that.
---
This place accepts criticism but only if it's presented in a way that doesn't hurt the readers' feelings.
---
I see, thank you for the update
---
It is possible that the game does not save which private world the player has been on correctly if the client does not exit cleanly, at least in the case of this bug. So, the server was still running for the OP, but could not be found (because the information was lost) by the client on re-launch.
---
Am on PS4 🙂
---
I had a couple good pulls. 
---
Got a F FFR Handmade and a BE Harpoon gun!
---
So the other day I was eating some razor blades, and wtf!? They cut my mouth all up! This is unacceptable, razor blade manufactures, please fix!
---
All the fallout 4 assets are already in fo76 have a dig around
---
faster reload bat?
---
Ahh that’s amazing! I hope to be able to visit someday as well. I think they have a merch shop online as well! + I’ve had so many encounters with our lord Mothman but one of my favorite encounters happened when I was overtaking a workshop down in Berkeley Springs. I was in need of lead and crystal in the name of ammo and camera film so it was a good spot! I took over the workshop and was setting up my resources when I felt His presence. And sure enough, there He was, keeping an ever watchful eye from the top of the Berkley Tower. I thought maybe He was keeping watch on my behalf but He was merely the harbinger of my doom as I was brutally murdered by my fellow Vault Dwellers. But Mothman cares not. + Good luck to everyone in the giveaway!
---
No they aren't. This engine is more easily modded than any on the market. Combined with Bethesda's willful negligence has created a perfect storm of suck.
---
I agree with u. It wasn't until I got to 200 that I had my character fully together. But I still tweak things mostly with armor, my weapons are spot on for my build.
---
It’s all random. Today I got my 3rd plasma grenade plan, and it came out of a small gift from a Santa scorched
---
Yea i got that. But things that werent in fo4 arent bodyslide compatible from what i see.
---
It depends. It could take someone 300 levels to farm/find the gear that makes you 'high level.' Technically, you're high level at around lvl 70 or so since you should have all the perks you need, but if you only have 1 character, you may not be high level because you still haven't found the right gear for your build.
---
I have 4 characters and a mule to share equipment. So with a combined level of 500+, any of them over lvl 70 or so are high level as I've already been collecting gear for another character before it's even been created.
---
You're telling me that you dont like that level 15's did more raids than you and dont deserve that vault steal?? 
---
/sarcasm
---
She probably doesn't like short and linear games with boring combat.
---
hmmmm lol
---
have an upvote sir, this made me laugh.
---
What kind of thing would he want?
---
Xbox!
---
Me too. I spent over 900 scrip and didn't get a single weapon or armor worth keeping.
---
He runs a bloodied build and uses rifles mainly but it always looking armour plans 🙂
---
Ore, acid, concrete, junk. There’s a bunch of types
---
Gold,Uranium, Coal Allen give Ore or need refined.  Never set up an extractor on Silver or steel.
---
Please repost this!
---
Heh. I get it.
---
I have had several good pulls, rngesus has favored me this sale.
---
You might want to check yourself. He’s made several videos as it all went down and even made a follow up and reported on the fix. But I guess y’all don’t care about that.
---
Ahh I’m on PS4. Plenty of good people around that will guide you if needed I’m sure!!
---
Copper gives ore as well. Personally I think the best one is acid
---
If you have 1st use private world to take the workshop's and put a Santa-tron in each then just hunt scorched for about an hour then visit all workshop's. I built mine in a room with a welcome mat so no messing around with enemies. Got nearly 350 gifts so far today.
---
I don't expect perfection but there is a reason why online games like MMOs are built in a different way than single player games. For Fallout 76 they just took a single player game and turned it online. That's asking for trouble and what we see is that hackers have ways in because the game has many more weaknesses because of that. 
---
So as much as I agree that it's always possible, Bethesda has built this game in a way that it's more vulnerable to such hacking exploits. It probably cost less to make that way, but the consequences are here. I find that irresponsible when you know hackers are out there. Hopefully this will be a lesson to companies not to cut corners and build games that are fit for purpose. Again, I agree that you can't guarantee there will never be a hack. I get that, but you shouldn't make it easier for hackers either. That's all I'm saying and I feel that's what's going on here.
---
Why bother replying if you're going to be childish about it? It's true you know, even if the article wasn't a hit piece it still wouldn't change the general consensus surrounding the game. Nobody is arguing the truth is important (I am not at least) so you're right in principle, but so what?
---
I’d say half the time I spawn into my camp my missile turrets do not work. I’ll have a group of 3, lvl 68 super mutants firing away and it just scans left n right without ever firing.
---
I  send people a message if I see they got a bunch and offer 1 cap per 4 rounds gotten alot that way
---
No, I don’t. He’s an overly biased opportunist pandering for clicks, and even his ‘followup that reported the fix’ still insinuated a lot of unfounded negative claims.  Yellow journalism at its ‘finest’. 
---
Try watching it again, this time without your star-struck fanboy glasses on.
---
Got it.
---
Can you please upload an image?
---
But am open to ideas if anyone can think of any
---
 Go get a Scorchbeast if you are offended. That's an appropriate response. ;)
---
From my experience, medium gifts can have two plans, and large gifts can actually have three, but this is extremely rare. I've only seen it a few times in the many many gifts I've opened.
---
Really they work when the blueprint doesnt contain a glitched item. However, there are so many ways to glitch an object in a place that the game wont normally allow that it causes blueprints to fail. Some of these ways arent even really "glitches" but build order things. Like placing certain walls or roof pieces before others. This can cause the game to render the blueprint invalid. Point is, blueprints work if kept insanely simple.
---
It was like that for my main character, but the next 3 characters got their shit together earlier and earlier.
---
Yup, that's RNG for you. I got the plasma grenade plan twice in about 30 minutes, and haven't seen it since.
---
Damn hoped I’d just missed over it or something
---
lvl 200+ means you're an elite player whether you want it or not
---
LOL Yup. I do this heh
---
too bad i couldn't buy it from you, i use .32 ammo on my zealots pipe pistol, it is good vs scorched ghouls waves
---
As a joke about a month ago I sent my wife a link to the Mothman Funko POP because I knew she’d make a face and tell me it was gross or something. What I only just learned is that she absolutely remembered me telling her about the Path to Enlightenment quest and the lighthouse in the mountains, so she left work for lunch and went right to Gamestop to snag the last one they had.
---
I’m not entirely convinced that my four year old knew why he was giving me a funny black bug toy, but he was very excited to do so and he could tell I was thrilled.
---
She knows that if we ever have enough money to make our way up the coast, we have to stop and let Daddy take a picture with my little buddy in front of that amazing statue in West Virginia.
---
Lead still gives scrap with the extractor, not ore (unless you pull it by hand)
---
