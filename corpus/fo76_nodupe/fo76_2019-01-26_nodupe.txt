This is unbelievably entitled. Just play the game, and if you don't like it, stop. Developers don't share roadmaps, across all types of content and not just games, because delays happen. They only announce something if they're fucking *positive* it will release on time, otherwise it's pitchfork crucifixion time.
---
---
---
with all the scumbag stuff they have continued to do? enjoy your 20$ santa outfit btw. yea shame on you
---
It happens every time for me so hopefully Beth don‚Äôt see it as a problem!
---
Here‚Äôs a weird couple of stats for you.
---

---
All from Xbox Live achievements
---
1. Only 74.54% of people actually manage to leave Vault 76. That‚Äôs around 25% of people who start the game never even make it into the game world.
---
2. More people manage to complete ‚ÄúTested Mettle‚Äù and ‚ÄúFighting Chance‚Äù (craft a weapon) than leave the vault.
---
Maybe the stats aren‚Äôt that accurate ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Also needed if going through a decon shower. 
---
There's a certain point where you need to release to make any real forward progress.  I'm happy they released when they did since it greatly accelerated that progress.
---
They told you up front this wasn't going to be a polished AAA release, it was an experiment.  You knew this.
---
I like the idea and I‚Äôve suggested something similar before. Tying workshops to a factions with bonuses would be awesome. There could be a workshop that gives exp bonuses or bonus attack power or even have something like ‚Äúif a faction can control a majority of the workshops on the map their entire team has an increased chance of 3 star legendary drops‚Äù
---
I don‚Äôt like that, not one bit! I‚Äôve just hit 31 and only starting to branch further into the ash heap so let‚Äôs hope I don‚Äôt experience that anytime soon.
---
Have you tried relogging?
---
Nothing kills your desire to keep playing in a session than this
---
Why wouldn't it matter for you? You could apply the BoS combat skin to the legendaries that match your build and choose a weight based on looks (I prefer sturdy for men and light for women)
---
Exactly what I mean, I've done the same thing multiple times with those Perks! Let's say Super Duper on instead of Serendipity and Chemist on instead of Nerd Rage and then die immediately.. I'd like the to think I've gotten better remembering over time, but some Perks slip through the cracks and my build is temporarily flawed. -_-
---
You mean the one that you get from camp mclintock?
---
Crashed your Internet?  So, all Internet services in your place are now down?
---
[removed]
---
If you couldn't find $60 of value in the game, I don't know what to tell you.  They clearly put a huge amount of work into the game world and content, so talking like it's just a cash grab is frankly bullshit.
---
Gameplay is allowed to be boring for a while.  I played FO4 for over two years and would be playing it today if it were new, so it's not like there's an expiration date on fun content.  FO76 has no monthly fee and you can just set it aside for 6 months if you want during the content lull.
---
Tldr it was going to be March until we realized how bad of an idea it was to let you bring in existing characters.
---
Can you imagine how much better the beta could have been if they'd had a closed alpha? That would have been great.
---
Because I prefer heavy BOS, I prefer the mod and the look of BOS and heavy, so I just wouldn't change any of that
---
My PC connection.
---
lol, I've been confusing that spelling my whole life. I'm going to ninja edit it.
---
Thanks for the Reply! 
---
I guess I got lucky when I found a level 35 handmade at 25 and waited til I could use it. Never even bothered to try an assault rifle til recently at level 70. Never had a reason to. I get that it‚Äôs mid tier but the difference in power is really drastic and a huge turn off on an otherwise cool gun. You can get the same results with a 10mm SMG without using rare ammo and it‚Äôs significantly lighter 
---
Bandolier rank 2 reduces the weight by 90%, which rounds down to 0
---
Go ahead, it seems to be cathartic for you.
---
The quest at Camp McClintock awards Dirty Army Fatigues. I'm looking for the clean version, just called "Army Fatigues". As far as I know, you can only get them from turning in Technical Data. Do you have them?
---
Or drop a single worthless item like a bobby-pin and then back out of the pip boy and check to make sure the bag is there before dropping valuables. It‚Äôs what I usually do when there isn‚Äôt a convenient obvious container to dumps stuff into.  
---
Disagree. Because this title was rushed it never had a chance. I would have gladly accepted a delay so that my online buds might have picked up the game. Instead every single one of them gave it a hard pass due to its rightfully earned bad press. 
---
Yup, it's riiiiiight up there!

Hi! Your post has automatically been removed because your post's title appears to be in breach of rule 6:

Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title.

The key card is the first step in the chain of events to launch a nuke. From there you have to collect code pieces etc. Towards the end of the main quest line, the full sequence for launching a nuke is explained in game. 
---
No idea,I'm at work. I just remember getting clean ones from the vending machine as part of the quest.
---
"There is no hunting like the hunting of man, and those who have hunted armed men long enough and liked it, never care for anything else thereafter."
---
You can maybe make a proposal. Right now, Bethesda, we, and everyone else knows the game is full of duplicated TSE weapons. I've spent 300 hours in F76 with fair amount of farming and yet I still haven't found a TSE. And yet everyone else has or sells about 6-7. Bringing those into a PvP server would just be a one shot fiesta, people who'd like to try it, legit people that love the game and aren't into the TSE tryhard train, would literally have no fun in playing the game. Even if players are separate by level, people like me who are 100+lvl and never had or wanted a malicious TSE weapon, would stand no chance against people who duped or even bought TSEs just so they can have a TSE.
---
Maybe add a third mode called "Kids enter here" so all those minmaxers who think they are something by holding a TSE can splash around trying to see who can one shot each other first to get that alpha male feeling.
---
Personally I really want to keep relevelling, as long as I can keep the plans and recipes. That's my progress, the levels are just a frame.
---
Yup
---
No disrespect man. I am a minor noob considering your stats lol. I just meant I have quite a few high level 76 players. 
---
I felt I rushed my first play through so want to make a new character and focus on all the quests  and spend the time levelling up but it‚Äôs fun having a main account to run around with your team üòä
---
So dont use It... Most of us hate how enemies in this game are massive bullet spounges. Tse weapons are the only viable guns. Everything else is garbage and thats why everyone was melee pr√© TSE weapons.
---
 and raise the special to 55
---
No. This is based on the comments in the vault article by Bethesda. 
---
Go read it. 
---
It's worth adding that veins are instanced :-)
---
People really need to get new hobbies :)
---
Maybe there's a small chance to get clean ones from there, but it definitely gave me dirty ones. I haven't been able to find any information about acquiring them any other way. Just let me know if you have them when you get a chance to check. I'd appreciate it.
---
This just started happening to me. I've just disconnected 5 times in a row trying to place this CAMP I've spent at least 2 hours working on. 
---
I manage to get it placed, then maybe a few minutes pass before I'm disconnected from the server.
---
PREACH ON brotha! 
---
You hit the nail on the head on every single point, especially the event rewards and the endless grind of plan hunting. I cant even think of a word to describe how awful the RNG is... Oh great, my 23rd copy of ultracite explosive vents... lucky me.
---
You kind of lost me at the part about sharing perks with 15 charisma. I dont play on teams often, I thought I could share more than 2 perks.
---
Can do.
---
a mini nuke.... strong? are you serious? 
---
Yes
---
1. PC
---
2. Trjames3

3. N/A

if you dont want PvP, be quiet. you can still hide in your little bubble on adventure mode cocksucker
---
Thanks for all the input, really helped.  
---
Words are words. Calling someone cancerous is a way of describing them. It's unfortunate that you have people you care for suffering from it, but the word is just an adjective. Get over it.
---
&gt; I hope for your sake that nobody you love does get cancer, but if they do, you will finally understand quite how toxic and nasty you have been to other people.
---
Do you have any idea what this sounds like...? It's a little something called false positivity paired with malicious intent (an intent you may or may not cause). There's nothing positive about such a comment, and it's certainly not neutral in any way, meaning it's only of ill intent to others. That's just not something you should say, let alone with how you worded it. You're hoping it at least takes someone's death, someone that someone cares about, to potentially make them realize "how toxic and nasty" they are. That's just not the kind of shit you should ever say. I'll give you another example of what you said in different wording: "I hope you become a better person now that your husband, who you loved dearly, has died in a car crash". "It's a shame that your child choked to death, but I hope you can grow as a person because of it." "I hope your sister doesn't commit suicide, but hopefully you'll be able to understand how bad of a person you are if it does happen." This is the kind of shit you hear from someone who is extremely manipulative, or someone who will immediately make threats if they feel if anything doesn't go their way. If you've watched Game of Thrones, and you know who Cersei is, this is exactly the kind of person she is, and she's an evil bitch. If you didn't mean anything malicious behind such a comment, why would you ever say it? It's a royally fucked up thing to say. 
---
I'll allow it, but if this is the first you've heard of them you might have some difficulty making that happen.
---
You really don‚Äôt have to thank them for fixing a broken perk card that should‚Äôve worked effectively at launch. It‚Äôs just not necessary. 
---
and can we have a different model 
---
for the blade of basset and other blades   then a generic Chinese officers sword 
---
I mean how hard can it be to model a cat themed rapier 
---
course
---
i hope two shot weapons are not the top of the foodchain. I hated them in 4. 
---
and yeah. its cool that for as much as i have done, i still have so much more to explore. 
---
I just noticed rule 6 on this subreddit don‚Äôt like you lol
---
\&gt;why all the hate?
---
Because it will make the game better and they desperately want Fallout 76 to fail.
---
Godly
---
Do you know the spot by any chance? 
---
Theres one due west of vault 76 before you get to the mothman museum too.  It's quite comfy.  Look for a bullseye target for bows and arrows.  It has a top entrance that I usually close off and a front entrance
---
I've experienced the bug before. 7-10 a second isn't that bad though. I guess all I can do is hope they give us a card in the future.
---
I mean, literally nothing you said here is true. How sad is it that you actually have to make things up to try and get some self satisfaction about a game that people enjoy. Take off the fedora, go outside, try and interact with the real world for once, and stop trying to fear monger and make stuff up. Ironic that you brought up 6th grade, since that's what your writing looks and sounds like. 
---
If I recall correctly it's not a specific spot, but a drop from doing events or quests. I don't remember exactly which one, sorry.
---
They need the input of the fans. It signals what is good about the game, and what is not. Some people are yelling for pvp. Why? Because everyone who isn't primarily concerned with PVP doesn't have any incentive to participate. It's not fun at this point. One shot builds are dominant, and eliminate any actual counterplay. The rewards suck, or can be acquired elsewhere more reliably. It's the root of the problem.
---
The problem isn't the slap mechanic, it's that a lot of potential pvpers won't bother. Myself included. Good rewards will put people on Hunter radio, and there'll be plenty of people to PVP with. The PVP people have places to engage, but not enough incentive to do so. That's the root of the problem.
---
The most glaring example of PVP failings I can think of in this game is a nuke zone last weekend. Queen is down in 4-5 minutes, no hassle. I'm playing my high level medic/support build. My friend is playing level 70 or 80 stealth vats sniper. This guy does enough damage for 8-12 players by himself. Seriously. His wife is level 30ish working on her new stealth ninja melee build. Someone wants to PVP the level 33. That's the predatory griefer for you. His 3 friends are looking on, waiting to grab her flux. The opportunists. They don't know we're a team apparently. I fast travel out, because I have Max caps and hundreds of top tier junk. Nothing to gain, and I want my violet flux for ultracite fusion cores. My buddy tell his wife to go ahead and engage. She slaps back, my buddy drops the first guy instantly. She vats sneaks his friend standing next to him, one shot. My buddy drops the other two in less than a second with gun Fu and an automatic handmade. 4 guys, power armor, exploding weapons, I don't think they got off a shot. PVP seems a bit generous to describe the situation. Completely backwards I might add.
---
I don't know man i played PUBG and there were cool noments when the defeated pleaded for his life and attacker spared him and teamed up. But then went their way because it is illegal in that game to team up. In fo76 it is not illegal to team up so there will be even more socialising. The forced interraction will defenetly motivate people to speak on their mike and that always leads to knowing new people, makjnv new friends, even with people that killed you when you talk and find out he is a decent guy. Survival mode won't be the slaughter house you think it will. I'm more then sure that Bethesda will disable markers and since you don't know were other players are you will do your thing just pve-ing. Survival mode will actually require your IRL Charisma to survive by knowing how to defuse a battle or even join a fellow raider just for later to stab each other in the back. Or actually earn someone's trust making a new friend.
---
Wow i don‚Äôt think I have ever seen someone use it does it really work?
---
Yup, something a la the farm plots in FO4. 
---
That‚Äôs alright, thank you for the help. 
---
Man I get disconnected a MINIMUM of 4 times every time I play. (2+ hours) 
---
The worst is when I set up 3 workshops then was just about to go start reaping the benefits then got DC. SOOOO frustrating. 
---
Let us be crazy OP. That's FUN. Nerfing everything to death is not. Diablo 3 became better instantly when they upped legendary drops.
---
I really hope that's an indication that they are considering adding npc's. I believe the game would be so much better if they did
---
"Ok, fine. Commit resources to PvP servers. I'm sure that will keep approx 5% of players happy."  
---
**"**Survival Mode is Wasted Dev Time"  
---
"Players bought Fallout 76 for the PvE (90% or more of players). " 
---
Yeah, it's like everyone assumes if you like PVP you're either a duper or a greifer.  
---
Unfortunately that's not the case, we just want a challenge.
---
Yeah, but what the hell am I supposed to do with my extensive excel sheet ive been using to keep track of everything? 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aj4qgh/psa_troubleshooting_the_camp_budget_exceeded_bug/
---
Exactly! I don't even care to play now only to get the 1400caps from vendors a day and sometimes I forget to do that.
---
Maybe you should take a break ...
---
&gt; Dare I dream of a world where tight, coherent features are not spectacular but instead considered mundane?           
---
   
---
Bethesda disliked that
---
OP vs enemies, totally. In PVP, it's mechanically unsatisfying.
---
The mistress of mystery set does this. Maybe wearing the set allows you to add an extra visual item that grants the additional bonuese
---
I have this problem with plans a lot.
---
I'm swearing cause it gives me a random selection of junk parts, not even the good ones, just antiseptic and wood scraps, and then I go into inventory and excavator power armor servos.
---
Actually I found this. It might help.
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1p_2jw2yNRY8JIE7qTfUwXTgivFDcuy0Xltb4N8kct4o/edit?usp=drivesdk
---
I'd say at your pace you're about 50-60% in
---
70% if you‚Äôve done hw free states portion of the quest line and not skipped over it to do defiance has fallen 
---
I've never seen anyone use it but me. He shows up a lot at max rank and I've found him to be both helpful and good company. I'll probably trade him in for Better Criticals and the mutation perks when I get them, but I'll always throw him in play from time to time.
---
Thanks!
---
Hmmm if that is the case then I believe the game is not coded to get values over 100% since I run 90% junk weight perk I must cap at 100 with the first piece and the second piece does not add anything in regards to weight reduction.
---
I think everyone is going to be one-shotting each other.
---
Hm does he distract enemies?
---
Oh you mean the guy who stole content from me and watermarked it and we got him shut down on instagram. He can suck a radroach off. 
---
I find that to be boring. If I wanna read to get stories I'd go pick up the 1000s of amazing books out there with way better stories. 
---
1 perk only. It's my favorite but most frustrating mechanic.
---
I bet you wouldn't be saying what you're saying right now if YOU had a tse weapon like the dragon. Most people I've seen complaining about the might of tse weapons don't have any themselves. That's not a coincidence.
---
You mean like the ideas listed, you'd like to see those have something similar like the Mistress of Mystery set?
---
I'd  buy a chally statue.. I'd love the chance to replace my lion statues with something more moojestic.
---
A trigger-able camp defense mission would be so fun, and really give people so much more to do, even if it‚Äôs just moving around camps to get different types of spawn. 
---
Fixing the turrets would be a nice bonus there as well, but I‚Äôd take just a base defense. 
---
It should be in some way where you can contribute to ask for a new wave, and each wave is stronger, eventually you would find your break in point 
---
Also give an easy way to throw more legendaries at people, which wouldn‚Äôt be terrible 
---
I have my doubts as to whether Bethesda is even capable of that.    Remember, if duping is possible for even one week during the beta, then the world is from then on flooded with OP duped weapons and the in-game economy is forever fucked. 
---
I don't think I'm exaggerating by saying that duping has irrecoverably ruined the in-came economy for the main game. It makes no difference if duping isn't possible right now. The damage is done- there are thousands of OP weapons, armor, bobble heads and mutations that are floating around the game world.   In survival mode this is a much more serious problem. 
---
Just saw my first chicken a day ago or so as well.
---
They won't fix the game for the majority of players. They are out of touch with the player base and the big thing these days is pvp, thank the success of Fortnite for that. They turned a garbage pve game into the most successful pvp game ever, I wouldnt be surprised if they are testing the waters for something similar. Most game companies these days dont give a shit what the players want, unfortunately.
---
What we NEED are end game raids, dungeons, bosses. The queen is a piss poor sad excuse for endgame content. As it stands the only endgame currently is farming white springs and fighting the queen.
---
I have put the game down until they add something worthwhile. I have Bf5, Res Evil 2, and soon Anthem I'd rather spend my time on.
---
Amen.
---
I shit you not as soon as I opened this thread my internet crashed.
---
As for a fix all I can suggest is making sure your router isn‚Äôt getting too hot. Make sure it‚Äôs in the open and maybe put it it on it‚Äôs side.
---
That's a new one for me : My xp is blocked at the beginning of level 133. When I go to my perks, the level up interface doesn't show up. The interface also no longer show xp gains in the bar.
---
This happened to me also with a raider set...I pulled the stuff off then dropped not placed the frame then left the world to get rid of it
---
Ye I missed the nick and kinda wrote thst to the other guy, I dunno you and I apologize.
---
I think autistic people who were struck by the incompetence and arrogance of some noob might be the ones saying such things.
---
I don't know. He only had a sliver of life left. My dead body was thrown far from the location when a vehicle exploded. I assume he was incapacitated by the explosion. I found out that they don't die when Phoenix the Vendor bot was surrounded and incapacitated by several high level robots in Watoga Shopping Plaza.
---
You don‚Äôt **know** that it was rushed. Only that it was shipped early. 
---
You might think you do, because the internet sensationalism herd mentality told you so, but you don‚Äôt. 
---
Many products today ship early very deliberately, not for executive wants revenue now reasons, but to spend as much of the dev period as possible with a real and large audience already using the title, so the development effort is spent building what users care about, 
---
Can we get a map location?
---
Also fix the "too many holotapes" bug.
---
It is not unreasonable to expect a finished game. They have literally had years to fix some of these issues before the game came out, how much more leeway could they possibly need?
---
NVM just found it
---
Who exactly do you miss? No nose throat cancer ghoulish people or is it Preston? I'm happy as fuck there are no NPC. They would surve no purpose in the end game. They just waste game resources on lipsync for a one time quest that you finish once and then that NPC will forever waste server space contributing to even lower stash budget.
---
It's the last image in the Imgur set :) 
---
I'd agree and say to keep it simple, if you're in PvP you can't switch out your loadout till after the fight. 
---
I could imagine someone having a full tank build with Vanguard armor (high hp) and when about to loose, switch out to Unyielding armor (low hp) and hit like a dump truck last second to win? But then again, maybe some people are interested in something like that..
---
Bethesda should change it from a weight limit to an item limit. Ie 50 guns, 50 armor, etc. Those are random numbers pulled out of the air as an example. Infinite junk. That wouldn‚Äôt be a strain on servers either and they could still have weight in player inventory for balance.
---
Oh, I'm not trying to deny that there are things people who play the game certain ways can do that could entertain them for a while. There need to be some more social systems for me to see myself sticking around for a while, but I'm not everyone.  
---
But those numbers aren't anecdotes, and they are somewhat unusual compared to other games with level achievements. Like I say in my edit, the percentage of total players that cross that line over time is as much good data as we're going to get. However, I'm not too interested in monitoring it myself. The only benefit is some awareness in these discussions about representative players. I don't know that these threads are too important except in tempering some subreddit internal debates about what people want. BGS knows if they have a problem with people dropping out early or playing fewer hours in the late game and, hopefully, they would just respond to requests that connect with what they're already observing.
---
It cannot handle me having a full stash so ..
---
lol. what. so instead of 200% im still getting +45% BEFORE demo expert and damage perks. its the RoF that im talking about. i do more DPS even after the patch, with all given information.
---
I dismantled my entire camp. Stored, not scrapped.  Then put things back so as to not see that annoyance. I tried many things from the internet but none worked until I just started over  Good luck. 
---
 Sure I'll tell you where my CAMP with 3 Lead Veins is. Then you can be another guy screwing me up. 
---
 West of Watoga eh'. ;)
---
Vaulty got deleted from Instagram for selling shirts with copyrighted artwork on them, &amp; for posting a bunch of "original content" not made by him. I wouldn't promote him as the creator of such a popular meme because chances are that he didn't create it. 
---
half his content was from fallout radposting, a huge facebook group. 
---
Well in the main questline you do &gt;!walk!&lt; and after that you go and &gt;!walk to a specific place!&lt; and after you manage to get through that you have to &gt;!To the town of Agua Fria rode a stranger one fine day. Hardly spoke to folks around him, didn't have too much to say.!&lt; All in all the main quest is very fun with all this combined
---
Man you're dense, Bethesda bought the IP from, IDK Blackisle game studio mabye. This already happened.
---
Not the same issue but thank you
---
Literally had to drop 40+ radaway because of the weight being so high
---
Yes! I'd say this is his best attribute. But he puts dudes down when he needs to.
---
But when a super mutant hits you will one it's like the fucker ignores all armor. A missile wielding super mutant is one of the only things I cant tank while walking away to take a piss
---
I also stoped playing because i had my fun and got my money worth, but when there is all the duplication griefers, and one kill bobblehead stackers, there is no point for me to continue playing. Like really, i wanted to be wendor, and go trough craft route, to selling wastelanders stuff i create or find.
---
But with this broken Economy? Hah no chance for me.
---
If they gave us a roadmaps and showed us the game will be playable again and with those issues fixed, i am more then willing to get back to the game.
---
No way, I'd make a full scale bounce house out of mini-marshmallows and use a dump truck to pour hot chocolate over it. Then I'd bounce. I'd bounce.
---
No dude, but like a family member I will avoid them more and more if they treat me like crap. Hence not purchase preorders or dlc.
---
I agree, I guess I lucked out and got my first handmade around level 23 or 24 (had to wait until level 25 to use it) but the Assault rifle was one of my favorite rifles in FO4 but i seems out of place in FO76
---
Amen
---
Vaulty has never created a single piece of original content lmao, let alone the "excuse me wtf" meme
---
I ran into one on the secons floor of a house once. I knew it was there but didn't see it so I dashed across the hallway to get the weapons crate. The wendigo was waiting for me in the doorway and chomped my face when i turned around.  I screamed. 
---
 I sold at least 4 today. I lose track so easily. Almost none are worth keeping.
---
Have you actually tested 5 armor pieces?  I know the mod isn't stackable with the 90% perk card but maybe stacking 5 pieces of 20% instead of using the 90% perk could get you to 100%.
---
As far as snazzy mysterious duds...
---
Closest might be the hunters long coat and one of the fedoras? 
---
Theres also a black cowboy hat.. But that might not have the look youre going for.
---
Maybe one of those civil war jackets? I have one that goes past the knees.
---
Until they put the silver shroud outfit in the atom shop (which.. I dont see why they wouldnt. But beware. Theyre probably gonna charge a ton for it), those might be some options.
---
Why do you need a dozen weapons?
---
&lt;3
---
Herd Mentality? Go fuck yourself buddy, you don't know me. The early access model only works when you actually advertise that's it's a work in progress. At that point it's up to the fans to support, and as a fan, this shit is awful. This is a triple AAA dog turd that I wanted badly to lovingly eat straight from Bethesda's asshole. I'd still be playing it if it wasn't for all the god damn lost progress from being disconnected every 5 minutes. 
---
Seems like the would automatically come up like PA Raider, PA T45, PA T51b...you get the idea
---
I would guess there is a bug on that achievement as I'm 95% sure I've killed well over 20 people. I've platinum'ed (sic) the game apart from that achievement.
---
He's fun but I switched him out for Saviour. Everything was either dead or I was dead by the time he showed up but nice to be able to call up a tank. They should buff him so he's guaranteed to draw aggro. Or they could add ANOTHER Mysterious person. Bring back Miss Fortune!
---
Yeah, I wasn‚Äôt sure. Good luck!
---
Right. If only it was that simple.
---
You're absolutely right-letting PVE characters transfer to PVP is a bad idea. They haven't fixed the duping issue yet, it'll be a mess.
---
Shielded underarmor. Mine gives me 3. Urban Operative I think is the one I have. 
---
Like I said there still needs to be more end game PVE content: more bosses like the SBQ and these new vaults could be interesting.
---
While the servers aren't perfect I only get dc'ed once at most during a 4 hour session. 
---
Saying that pvp isn't interesting because of meh balance is your opinion.For me I really enjoy it and think its far more balanced than people think (it does need work though). While the majority of the player base was complaining about being one shot and just assumed there was no solution, I went out and explored the mechanics of the game and asked myself, is there a way to survive an assault from a TSE weapon? I did some research some testing of multiple methods and then about a week ago implemented the solution - and yep its very possible. Is there a counter to my build? Pretty sure there is multiple haven't gotten around to testing the one that I think is gonna be most effective though. I agree the lag issues need to be sorted up as I've noticed shots not registering at all, I imagine they will make this more of a priority once the new PVP servers come out. 
---
Well there is no exact person that I miss, it's just the overall experience that it brings. Such and dialogue encounters, community environments, companions with interesting backstories, ect. plus the missions even if short would be alot better than just chasing holotapes to corpses. But honestly the way you phrased it with server usage and all it does still seem unlikely. 
---
Build to the max height. Build straight out to the edge. The max allowable height doesn't decrease as you approach the edge. Cylinder, not sphere. 
---
It would have been fucking awesome. A solid month of hammering the servers and constant device work to kill the bugs, the media twats wouldn't know what to do with themselves.
---
One shot of my TSE Gauss does 3 times the damage as a mini nuke. I can also carry 1000 2mm ammo while each mine nuke is 6 lbs.
---
When you do the math the wt of a fatman or missile launcher and their ammo it simply is not worth having. With the right perks they can do nice AoE damage and could be ok for certain fights. But the will not be anything but a niche weapon.
---
There are just a ton of other weapo s that do a lot more direct damage, are more precise and have much better RoF thus a lot more over DPS.
---
I agree with OP for these weapon to be taken seriously Heavy weapons overall should weigh a lot, give the player a movement penalty when thw weapon is equipped, prevent the player from sprinting but have unsurpassed DPS.
---
I was in one instance where the sbq was one shot killed. I hope everyone at least managed to tag here before that guy came along. The other thing that bugs me is that I went full melee two-handed weapons build, and even mutated and chemed out I can‚Äôt even seem to move her health bar. 
---
I heard for some reason the fist weapons do more damage by far, that makes no sense hahaha 
---
I love you stats man.
---
I feel your pain 
---
That's debatable. Within the confines of the perk system, it gives you a choice of what items you want to carry more of, and since they're spread over several specials you can decide based on your build whether or not it's worth investing points into weight reduction. Sure it's an annoyance, but weight management is always an annoyance in video games, but is still used an them anyway. I'm curious what better ways there are of implementing these perks though, I'm sure they exist but I'd love to hear them.
---
One of the Dev leaders did mention there are unannouced PvE content expected for March.
---
Exploring. I‚Äôm still new, only level 26.
---
Oh, and sniping super mutants and listening to the crazy shit they say!
---
Well if you could read you would clearly see that no where did I state I wanted a single player game. Third grade reading teacher is calling bobby
---
Thanks! I'll give those a shot. It would be dope if there were two identical Mysterious Strangers running around. 
---
Is anti-armor that important? I always throw away anything that doesn't have Two Shot or Explosive. I know they will be nerfed but i feel like i still need at least 1 of those 2 mods and then combined with something else to actually keep a weapon.
---
I got the good grief achievement mostly by just killing people who already had bounties, or screwing around with my friends. I mostly get annoyed with PvP and have no intention of player Survival. So, I‚Äôd say even THAT percentage could be high.
---
Only disagreement I have is bashing for miniguns with the shredder mod. You‚Äôre not wrong for other guns but I‚Äôd pay an outsized amount for an Anti-Armor Minigun with bash damage. 
---
 I get 10 ore and that's 50 Lead. So yes. ;)
---
I totally agree with this as i shot a MIRV fatman (The daisycutter actually) at a mirelurk queen and it LIVED 
---
Faction-only workshops. Basically workshops that can only be taken by faction members on behalf of a faction. Like the responders taking back Wade airport. Imagine responders and brotherhood members competing for a workshop in Flatwoods, so they have a better chance to recruit new players.
---
Plus, this would allow us an opportunity to change the landscape of the world. And it would be dynamic as these workshops could change hands. And since factions are far more encompassing than teams, it could be persistent on a server. Only changing when another faction takes it.
---
What we need is those garden plots you can place on your roof or in your building like in fallout 4 so we can better protect our gardens. Muh flowers!
---
You have 9 main quests left.
---
Add 6 more quests if you count the ones that branch off from the main quest, but you do them while doing the other 9 quests, mainly in 2 of those quests.
---
They are delicious.
---
Got it on Xbox, would‚Äôve gave it for free.
---
Give it a rest 
---
Why stop at dirt? I'd love to place grass blocks.
---
They spawn outside my C.A.M.P. sometimes. Tell you what though I'm lvl 103 and have never come across a sloth or a fog crawler apart from at a SBQ fight. I've hunted high and low too. Found them dead a few times but never alive. 
---
Free States is pretty much a cult too.
---
&gt;You‚Äôre all just making shit up and wildly guessing to try to prove your points. 
---
This sub in a nut shell. Personally I can't wait for the PvP servers to go live but fuck if I voice that around here
---
Those are solid numbers imo, compared to other games. That's still a lot of peopke
---
You can upgrade it as you level up. But you need to have one to use. So if you sell it or lose it, you can not craft a higher level one. And, I have yet to be able to get back in the mansion to acquire another, even with all the correct attire. 
---
I agree completely! I hate unloading 20 missiles at a lvl 58 Super Mutant and barely drop him to half his life. But 6 or fewer power swings from the Blade of Bastet finish him.
---
Embrace it.
---
Good point.
---
‚ÄúAfter‚Äù you finish fallout 4??????
---
Found this thread on a search.
---
Chiming in that I also have this issue. Both on my Ryzen 7 2700x and my girlfriend's FX-8320.
---
Also don‚Äôt forget he likes to act like he works for Bethesda to try to elicit sexual photos from woman in the community. Absolute scumbag. 
---
Do you know what level you need to be to trigger it?
---
I checked out the prison but didn't see it. 
---
I'm only lvl22 though so I suspect that's not high enough
---
&gt; They told you up front this wasn't going to be a polished AAA release, it was an experiment. You knew this.
---
Another fantastic quote for the [games tagline](https://imgur.com/a/ljDtvVF)!
---
I think it‚Äôs an interesting choice that shapes the way you play.  Are you going to use chems or food buffs?  Are you going to slug it out or run?  Are you going to use stims to pull up your friends or are you going to buff them up with just the right grub for their build.  Your choice of weight perks effects what you have on hand and that effects play.  Differences in how you play create variety and a greater array of options in play.  
---
Having the only choice you make be what  weapon you use is boring - I don‚Äôt want to just play a shooter - I want more substance to my character than that.
---
You could even play the guy that carries everyone else in the teams stuff - you don‚Äôt have too - but you can - and that is cool to me.
---
"builds"
---
Yes, all two of them. Sentinel/fireproof guns or cavalier/fireproof melee. What a meta. 
---
Whatever makes you giggle. Your insults are about 3rd grade. Irony. Amusing though. üòÅ
---
I also found early on stuff like dromedary was a basic a necessity because you would otherwise spend way more time just gathering food water and having to use them that much more often. I wish I'd grabbed good with salt way earlier. I still lose tons of food to rotting, but before it was almost not even worth it to cook anything you weren't going to eat right away. All said, there's probably 5 or 10 cards I would consider "required" especially for early players to get upkeep/maint tasks to a reasonable level. And if basically everyone is having to choose the same perks, what's the point of giving people the choice? 
---
I also think they have done an enormous amount of "fixing" bad QoL stuff by just making perks and punting it to the player to have to take that on if they want it. Want to actually see where your grenades are going to go or what an enemies stats are? Have to waste a perk point. There's a whole pile of stuff that should just be features in the core game, or options that can be toggled. And worse, there's a ton of stuff (like being able to find dead enemies) that you can't do and needs addressing, but most people would totally accept if they just made it a perk.
---
What level are you? The mansion is only about level 6. It should be easy peasy!!! I have my camp right next to it so I have free easy water and mole rats on easy access. 
---
I fucking love this idea.
---
I came here to say THIS. Not just for inventory management but also for people trying to populate the wikis. Part of why the wikis have been so slow to fill is that its sometimes hard to tell were you picked up things.
---
Wasteland Sarah Palin, nice!
---
I'm part of everyone I've been actually griefed 2 maybe 3 times tops since beta. Every other time it's simply me getting my ass handed to me after responding to engaging PvP with random. Out of well over 40 PvP encounters I've only met 1 individual who was actually cheating.
---
All the faction quests?
---
It takes a special kind of special to dispute the validity of your own statements and act as if it's a good thing. 
---
It should be "easy" mr scrub
---
Well that's a pretty obvious statement. Not every perk has to be fun!
---
i would like to see video proof of you doing this.
---
I finally hit level 50, so I took the opportunity to drop all my power armor chassis so I could equip my level 50 t-60 parts onto an empty one. I'm also experiencing an issue where I have to enter/exit every chassis I own every time I drop them in order to pick them up (my buddy on xbox says he doesn't have to do that) and in the middle of doing that my character animation froze and I've been stuck there for about 20 minutes hoping nobody comes along and steals my stuff until my friend gets online and steals it for me.
---
TL;DR my issues are:
---
1. When I drop a chassis I have to enter it before I can pick it up again.
---
2. My character is frozen in the "enter power armor" animation.
---
I really hope they make some way to tell what parts I have on a chassis without dropping it soon.
---
It‚Äôs to keep you from targeting them at a distance. They have a railgun for medium range and a claw for melee but they try to stay at medium range 
---
I had 1 cheater in over 40+ PvP encounters since beta and that certainly didn't ruin my experience. I run into more cheaters playing a few hours of R6: Siege then I have since November for FO76
---
I've only seen one recipe so far out of maybe 10 trips to the bunker and didnt have enough caps yet. But this is probably what I'd want to do for end game content, be a mutation salesman. I'm hoping I can get all of the decent recipes too so I can play around with different combos and be able to clear ones I dislike and know ill be able to put back on the ones I love. 
---
I mean when I do most of the game and feel complete
---
I've found it to be pretty respectable on the gauss rifle, which doesn't have any other base damage-boosting mods. The crimson flux needed for the ammo is easily found in nuke zones at both Fissure Site Prime and the Whitespring, so keeping up on materials isn't too terribly time-consuming. Green Thumb goes a long way in harvesting raw flux.
---
Can't speak for any other guns, though.
---
And an hour after you do it the quest will be back
---
You can, I have 4 in mine right now. 
---
I‚Äôve done the one with the Veil of Secrets, it was like the organization of secret women or something. Is that what you‚Äôre talking about?
---
It‚Äôs your right as a vault dweller in Murica to ‚ÄúBear arms‚Äù.
---
Such a helpful perk card.
---
How is this bug still in the game? I just lost my lvl 50 medic excavator pa torso to this bs. 
---
They also weigh a ton without perks!
---
Okay I regularly farm Fort Defiance for straitjackets and I have yet to see a tinfoil hat. What am I doing wrong
---
&gt; I'm trying to keep up with people dropping the queen in &lt;5minutes, let alone whatever boss comes next.
---
Those people are about to be gone forever, so whats the point? 
---
The gatling gun stock vs the stock super sledge, you're right. But put mods on them and the gatling gun closes that gap **heavily**, then you add in adrenal reaction and suddenly they're both sitting above 400. I like how you cherry picked the stock gatling damage and then talked about the melee damage with mods and perks added on top. Way to misrepresent the situation captain shit for brains.
---
&gt; Roll out your DPS calculations for everyone if you're so confident, but it's not gonna work out beyond "I can keep up and only spend 15x on ammo." Let alone how many rounds miss because minigun.
---
No one uses the minigun, no one mentioned the minigun we're talking about the gatling gun mr. funtime hypocrite toxicity jr. I did say something about the .50 cal, though, is that where you're bringing that in from? Are you trying to argue some other point entirely like you're some sort of smart guy? Jesus lol. 
---
you clearly have no idea what you are talking about
---
I just didn't open them on my second character it's so much nicer to swap cards 
---
This is what I've been doing but I wish I did not have to.
---
Vile of secrets, brotherhood of steel, responders, enclave. Either you finished the game super quick or I finished it super slow. I just finished with the enclave yesterday and I'm level 75. If you are done, I reccomend just exploring thoroughly. Drop at vault 76 and go towards every unexplored location you have. You may find something interesting or more missions, who knows?
---
So far my odd spottings are...
---
Cats
---
Chickens
---
Squirrels
---
Wolves (common)
---
Possums
---
Aliens
---
Big blue frogs
---
Rabbits i think..
---
Glowing fireflies 
---
Ooh ooh ooh..
---
 So around level 15, a group of friends and i killed a ...
---
Big supermutant dude. Like the one that spawned near trash pits in fo4. I STILL haven't found another one. Can i get a location on a spawn for him?
---
The only drawback to the ‚Äòknown‚Äô tag will be less newbie gifting.  I‚Äôm going to have to keep this in mind when I see plans I already have.
---
Were you asking me or the OP their level? As for me not being able to get in the mansion, I was referring to getting into the secure areas again. I think once you complete the quest, you can not get back past the laser grid. 
---
zero-g repulsive - adds 25 carry weight per arm.

I have seen loads of peoples post's cursing survival mode up and down reddit pages and also other social media outlets, wich is the "hate" I am referring to. In my mind the new survival mode opens doors to more dynamic player interactions. Bethesda isnt twisting any diehard fallout solo play fanboys or pve enthusiasts arm's to come play in survival mode, It is an optional mode. And yes there will be griefers, hackers and glitchers In the servers, but thats every game, and to the best of my knowledge Bethesda is and will continue to do everything in their power to curb that.I really do not think this makes every encounter guaranteed to be hostile, and I also believe that there could still be friendly interactions. I just think players will have to be much more cautious when it comes to interacting with other players in survival mode. The stakes are higher for all parties involved in survival mode. I know this wont make everyone think twice before just randomly picking people out, but I for one would definantly put some thought into who im attacking, my chances, and deciding the overall worth of said encounter. Bethesda is also supposed to have some level scaling  set up in the mode to allow lower lvl players a fighting chance against their higher lvl adversaries. I think minus the greifers and other online villains this is a good move for the MMO Bethesda is trying to build. No it is not traditional Fallout, but that was never even Bethesdas Plans. I think a lot of fans cannot wrap thier head around the fact that this is not a single player RPG and was never intended to be. I mean dont get me wrong I loved all the Fallouts for console, bugs and all. I played FO3 and fell in love with the series, I absolutely loved being immersed in the fallout universe all by my lonesome, I would love another single player installment, but thats not what FO76 was ever supposed to be. I was very excited to see this game drop as an MMO, to me it is a chance to experiance the wasteland in a different more dynamic way with actual players, and the new survival mode brings that rough dynamic I would expect in a wasteland to the table. It may not be what every one wanted but its what they told us we were getting, and the same players that didnt like that  still bought the game, and are still surprised and opposed to a Straight up PVP mode. I think this game needs a mode like this to really survive as an MMO down the the road. 
---
I started using a level 3 locked door then a level 3 locked computer to get past that part. 
---
Yes we missing on 30 free atoms :(
---
Hmm. Not skipping anything on purpose. 
---
The game exists to support the store, not the other way around.
---
I disagree. Games should be fun, not stressful and annoying. People do want some realism though, and reloading is one of those things that adds realism. Having a max carry-weight adds some realism. However both of those things are generally tuned to the point that is pretty far from 100% real, because at a certain threshold it gets to be tedious and actually detracts from the experience. 
---
And fo76 certainly has not found that best balance for more than a few things. Auto pistols for example, it seems like you spend as much time reloading as you do firing. Or that most energy weapons break after just a couple of reload cycles. Would they break in real life? Maybe, but for a game experience they are so far off the mark that most people don't even use them.
---
I'm not a fan of the increased caps. It's bad enough already. I'm level 300 but that doesn't make me any stronger than a level 50. Why do I lose 600 caps per death to their 100? How does that incentivize me to play? With how easy it is for people to abuse the mechanics I have no interest in risking that many caps. 
---
Last 5 people I killed with bounties on them had zero caps and we're just trying to get me to attack so their friend/friends hiding nearby could bypass slap damage. 
---
and yet...in the hands of a mole miner or Super mutant, one missile hit will take 50-75 percent of my health...
---
That‚Äôs why you have gear sets. You don‚Äôt just run around in your best gear all the time, you have back ups Incase you die
---
Yeah, I've tried everything with no luck
---
You should get Concentred fire and Gun Fu down to 1. Given your damage output with a shotgun you are going to two shots (at a minimum) any mob aiming at the head with a regular shot anyway,
---
Concentrated Fire is more to have the option to target different part. And when you crit, often given the build, you're going to one shot every mob.
---
As for Gun Fu, it's kinda of the same thing, it's more the target switch that is interesting in my opinion.
---
Antibiotics is not worth crafting in my opinion. To craft it you still need disease cure! The recipe requires: 3-antiseptic, 1-blood pack, 2(!!!)- disease cure 2- purified water and 3(!!!)- stimpaks!!!! That is insane!!! I was hoping I could find an alternative to disease cures because I hate traveling all the way to the Flatwoods area for all the ingredients. What a waste!
---
My husband was accused of cheating when he killed someone. It was at a workshop and he‚Äôs just perked out the ass for sniping. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
I'll take "works most of the time" over works none of the time. Thank you for your recommendation. I'll be paying the Enclave a few visits
---
Coolio :)
---
I know what you mean, theres only six or so fleshed out questlines. I was hoping we'd have additional content expanded on by now in some way but alas, survival servers instead &gt;.&gt;
---
It's certainly silly you can carry 6-8 heavy weapons with perks because they start to weigh almost nothing, yet modded-out rifles are all close to 20 lbs each.
---
Get the boulder to the top, so he can watch it roll back down again 
---
I love hunting them.  It‚Äôs especially satisfying to headshot them right after they call me puny human.  Lmao
---
I use dupes for different load outs like I have 3cards in long shot normally, but switch to a 2 card long shot in order to add glowing ones cards on my nuked build.
---
The gattling gun doesn't have any mods that increase damage ü§î I know because I can craft them all and I checked. Can't close a gap with imaginary mods. Captain shit for brains may have been a little strong, don't you think?
---
The people dropping the queen in under 5 minutes are legit builds. I realize how you don't get it though.
---
And yeah, I read mingun instead of 50 Cal. It's half the damage, but how did you compare the fire rate? Is that with or without martial artist? Gattling guns have missed marked fire rate, otherwise they'd shoot drastically faster than even a minigun with a fire rate of 400.
---
Keep on winning man. I'm sure everyone's impressed.
---
Worked yesterday.
---
how much for the bloodied rifle?
---
If you think about it, that probably abstractly represents having spare barrels or whatever for the heavy weapons more than actually lugging around 5 chainguns or whatever.
---
Yes. CONTENT! 
---
 how much for the bloodied rifle? 
---
The lvl 100+ just run around in circles in Whitespring nuke zones hoping for that 0.01% god tier weapon or armor.
---
I launched a nuke last night and legit got disconnected 12+ times within 2 hours. Make the fucking game stable before doing ANYTHING else. 
---
I need to get to that point! I'm having a hell of a time with the scorchbeast. I need a one shot for that thing! Lol
---
Turrets, water purifiers and light take up a lot of budget per piece. If you remove all turrets, use light sparingly and don't place many water purifiers you can spend a ton of budget just on the "shell" of the camp to get pretty impressive sizes.
---
Anyone in your squad can build at your/their base. The person who owns said base will be able to move and store the item but not own the plan to it.
---
This is just like SWTOR, companions are auto dismissed once you enter a group.
---
I &lt;3 the infinite loot loading screen 
---
It worked for Burke in Megaton, about half the time üòâ
---
He just needs his own radio ads on the existing networks.
---
I don't want anything close to destiny to touch this franchise. Please sir don't wish anything like that on this game
---
Likely dupers trying to make the most of the remaining time they have to scam from duped items 
---
I mean ......just HELL no
---
I'm very excited for these fixes, but I hope they have a lot more up their sleeves for this patch.
---
So I can build a little house with a stash a my friend base but he technically will own it. Does the item I place stay when he plays Solo or only if I'm in the lobby
---
It's kinda like if your car's engine exploded and the tires are on fire and there is a bear in the back seat so you take it to a mechanic and he only wants to wash the windows.
---
Pretty sure I found it in the room with the mattress fort. You go behind them?
---
Yea I‚Äôm to scared of the gamble for mutations that I‚Äôve just been farming the bunker and SBQ for recipes, praying for the marsupial recipe so I can experiment around again.   
---
Quick link your employees responses, but dont actually do anything....
---
That's a fantastically fun scene to visualize.
---
At some point they're going to open the remaining vaults, rumored to be 4 player dungeons. 
---
Ehhh platform? 
---
You're not funny
---
I'm kind of hoping this is what the Vaults will be
---
I couldn't imagine going hunting with a 20lb hunting rifle.
---
PS4 Sorry for not saying that in the post.
---
Im in as long as they keep players tankie enough to not die in a single hit w/o  power armor.
---
That's worse then the guy who claimed I was spawn camping him... nevermind that he kept seeking me out for revenge as I walked in the opposite direction he was coming from until he bled himself of all caps
---
&gt;The only benefit is some awareness in these discussions about representative players. I don't know that these threads are too important except in tempering some subreddit internal debates about what people want. BGS knows if they have a problem with people dropping out early or playing fewer hours in the late game and, hopefully, they would just respond to requests that connect with what they're already observing.
---
I think this entirely reasonable. 
---
I think a lot of what we see from those who are vocal here are the extremes. For every "I'm level 100+, and I have nothing to do" post, I see an equal number of people toss out "I've been playing all this time, and I'm still under level 50" reply. And I think many of these vocal people fall into the trap of thinking their experience is the norm, especially when other vocal people agree with them. And when they think their experience is typical, they start to think they know what is best for the game. When you end up with multiple, disparate groups all thinking they know what's best, the result is often the debacle that we see on Fallout 76 Reddit.
---
At some point, I think it's safe to assume that Bethesda has a vested interest in making the game succeed, and since they probably have more detailed usage data, they're probably (at least from their perspective) doing what they think will be best for the game's longer-term success. While I certainly don't think the company is perfect, with all other things being equal, the group with the most data generally has the highest chance of coming up with the best plan, so I remain hopeful, and I try not to get too riled up by the player debate.
---
Making Super Mutant Overlords even stronger than they already are? No thanks
---
It's all good, easily forgot about. Hope you have some success üëå
---
I‚Äôve done this and got what I think I can from those. It‚Äôs like how gouls will only give you certain diseases and bugs will only give you X or Y disease. Can, Fever Claw, only be gotten from death claws?
---
But thank you for the advice! :)
---
Weird, my system listed leave the vault around 96%
---
It was The Rusty Pick Bar. I see him everywhere. Another good way to off-load junk. 
---
2 1/2 to 3 turds. 1 just doesn't do it like it used to.
---
The dumbest part of trading is that there is no way to inspect the additional effects on legendaries while in the trade screen. You can see the first effect and the name of the weapon MAY reveal the second effect but you more or less have to trust the sellers word on the third effect unless they drop it on the ground for you to look at, and then you might just nab it and run. So currently there is not really any reliable and trustworthy way to trade without the risk of being scammed.
---
They're definitely worth vendoring, did you already empty all 7 that day?
---
How so?
---
&gt; The gattling gun doesn't have any mods that increase damage
---
Prime receiver. 
---
They would be stronger and weaker. They would do more damage, but you would also do more damage to them. The point is to get TTK down, because bulletsponges aren't that fun. 
---
Pretty sure you can only get Intiate paint rn
---
At least implement a return to last server if you folks can‚Äôt fix your disconnecting issues and stabilities .. I just died and disconnected and now I lost all the building materials I‚Äôve been farming for the last hour.  
---
I try to stick up for this game and continue to play it but man this stuff sucks so bad and is like playing an amateur hour game at times.
---
Bless your hearts, really. 
---
Because these fluffy little cupcakes need everything their way. Just wait until they go out in the real world where we all have to make sacrifices and compromises. It's the old "give and take". Too bad these young people got everything they wanted when they asked mommy and daddy for it. Spoiled brats, selfish, they want everything their way, aka millennials.
---
truth, i love mini shred and the power saw weaps
---
Exactly. Items placed in their camps will stay when they play solo, but if he doesn't have the plan for said item he can't build more of them.   
---
Every stashbox in the game will always show your own stash.
---
Sounds like you missed the Free States and BoS quests. I thought the Raider quests led into the Free States, although I could be wrong because I did them backwards. There's a bunker in the north-east of the Mire, if you need to pick up the thread.
---
Look at the player stats for most games. People play them for maybe 10 hit and then dump them. Or have overall low play hours spread over many titles.
---
Fo76 likely got dumped by most people who got it, especially given how meh it can be.
---
That's why it's a war

Make changing factions costly so people are not encouraged to use it to find your camp and trash it, or make it have some kind of time limit between joining, and make players of the same faction immune to damage from other faction members.
---
the Max int youll ever need for crafting is 6.  you can swap cards based on what youre making.  same with picking locks and hacking computers.  switch put cards as you need them.  as you get later into the game, having gear repaired to 200% makes it last a long time, and its easy to keep up with materials for repairs.  power armor lasts a very long time between repairs
---
This is great, can you guys please also acknowledge glowing feedback posts who aren't furious?
---
My /u is always open.
---
Mod it with MIRV and test! All of the bomblets might count separately as ‚Äúhits‚Äù and make the second shot hit reaaaaally hard.
---
Thanxs for explaining
---
It‚Äôs an MMO, make your own missions. 
---
Try not using fast travel. Find low level players and assist them. Try to claim every workshop. MMOs are what you make them. I‚Äôm 275 hours in and always find a way to enjoy the hour or two I play every day. 
---
Hope this helps. 
---
Of course. Just a little buff, so that TTK goes little bit down, but no one shotting.
---
I kill scorchbeasts pretty quick just using my non legendary automatic combat rifle with applicable perks using vats. They really aren't a big deal once you get focused on a good build and maxing damage for it.
---
Lolz
---
I‚Äôve resolved myself to the fact that our toons, die ingame but will respawn.
---
When they die and where they respawn, we can control.
---
My alt toon is 30 almost 31. 
---
Ash heap isn‚Äôt bad, just be careful of assaultrons at garrahan and that trainyards.
---
There‚Äôs also plenty of SB flaring around Lewisburg, and garrahan estates.
---
He killed someone at a workshop?! GRIEF! FILTHY CHEATING GRIEFER!... CHIEFER!
---
reported. 
---
I forgot to mention it's shared with anyone on your team and sometimes anybody in the area. Also don't get startled by a fast moving bright red shimmer, it's just a stealthed Assaulttron running at you. Yeah it see stealthed enemies too! (Doesn't work on hostile players in my experience)
---
I would like to add. If you need Lead too. Lucky Hole Mine has Lead. Also if you are on the server long enough. Claim the Munitions Workshop. 
---
As you are doing things it makes ammo for you, so when you get down. Fast travel. Get ammo. Fast travel to your camp and make more ammo. 
---
No you sent a YouTube link which is not a reddit post. YouTube does not equal reddit last time I checked
---
You are right, i'll be fix this.
---
I mean, if they focus mostly on releasing bug fixes while at the same time making and holding back more content until those bugs are fixed, then they can release those held back content much more quickly since they're already done. I think I'd rather have that because not only will the held back content be, hopefully relatively bug free, but we won't have to wait for months for new content. If that makes any sense
---
The balance in this game is beyond horrific, these bad weapons get even worse next patch from two shot nerf.
---
Wendigos are a pain in the ass but not like ghouls... I fucking hate ghouls. 
---
Yeah, constantly getting disconnected on PC.  This is not normal.
---
Yeah. I just had to shut down the game because of being stuck entering armour. Fortunately it was only a chassis and not my good armour. Forth time it's crashed today for me.  Does anyone have a theory as to why the game might be crashing all the time?  The server disconnects appear to be a separate issue.
---
I‚Äôve created a new character, and now discovering these plans. Coincidence? Don‚Äôt know.
---
My posts have revealed where I‚Äôve found ONE spot ... are these spots ‚ÄúNEW‚Äù spawn points? Are they related to Lookout Towers, or simply the same-old? I‚Äôll eventually head to the ‚Äúcemetery‚Äù, to see what may be revealed there.
---
/shrug
---
I found the free states quests by finding a dead body near New Gad with a holo that lead me to their bunkers one by one. That was a very long walk! LOL Im lvl37 haven't finished Rose yet! And nowhere near to launching a nuke! I cannot imagibe being close to finishing!
---
Funny thing is the dude was trying to take HIS workshop lmao. 
---
Sounds easy to implement, if devs weren't so lazy and incompetent.
---
I‚Äôve tried figuring out the silos studying with the map and the missile status holotape, but people either give up a lot or I don‚Äôt know what to look for yet ;) 
---
While I agree there may not be a roadmap per say, to say they have no clue what they're doing is just not true. They are actively listening to us and fixing the bugs we are raging about. Quality of Life change with the plans/recipes being "known" is in the works. The leveraction reload bug that was never fixed in FO4 was fixed, sooner than they thought too. They're working and listening with us so they do know what they're doing. At least the actual development team does. The atom shop creators however I agree with the don't know what they're doing
---
TF2: Cause a dominated player to leave the server
---
You‚Äôll always remember your first.  :)
---
I tried this, a explosive pistol is still better lol.
---
why would you do this...
---
Yes, my base is there too.  its taken half the time I log in already.  why share this?
---
I gotta say, diggin my silenced handmade.  Decent lead through output, semiautomatic, and great for short to mid range or.
---
If I could get a silenced voice of set, I‚Äôd be g2g.
---
I was using the fatman last night and ended up killing myself most of the time. How a mini nuke takes 25% health off scorched and obliterates me with power armor on was kind of confusing. Sold it to a vendor afterwards.
---
That would have been way cooler. Good call.
---
 You crashed your video card?
---
I‚Äôm trying to get into a similar mindset! And so began the screaming and panicking haha.
---
Oh damn there‚Äôs sb‚Äôs around lewisburg? I was just there as I‚Äôm working my way downwards to getting the excavator/pa stand plan, but I got distracted by big bendy tunnel. I‚Äôm definitely not strong enough even if I were to brave it!
---
I feel like it should convert over. Yes it using plasma cartridge ammo but it turns it into a flamethrower.
---
No
---
Try plant a carrot on top of em. 8f that dosent work there permanently there.
---
Try placing down food and see if it does the dissapearing thing when you hover it over the area where they are
---
Ha! That's next level sore loser right there. Probably needed an extra bag of cheetos to sleep that night.
---
I di read the post but it doesn't make sense to me. The server will reach that point effectively on its own over time, so what does it matter?
---
But getting to eat them afterwards makes up for it! 
---
I play on xbox but i see radium rifle plans all the time at the watoga train station. Just buy it, then build and scrap for mods!üòÅ
---
Can you let me know what are some improvements you would feel positive about? I'm working on the alternative views to those discussing meta gameplay like OP.
---
Nah shotguns will still be better since explosive dmg is exponential via pellets. Rifles vats will just 1 shot everything from miles away. Dont expect explosive weaponry to be more than just a meme for a while.
---
They are patching the game bi-weekly as far I know... And it was broke from the start. I dont think they have stopped attempting to put out fires since day one, and I dont think they plan on stopping after the new mode drops. Between curbing dupers and fixing bugs I think they have their hands full, but there is no doubt in my mind they will fix them. They have addressed and fixed alot of major issues since drop. I really dont see this mode affecting that in any way. 
---
*thank you*
---
Me too been 3 for me, really makes me angry
---
I've never once been killed by a griefer, is it a common occurrence?
---
  I fully support making the game less bullet spongy.  Balance Melee VS Ranged as well would be super.
---
The camp zone extends four stories upward ***and*** four stories downward. 
---
Since most people place their C.A.M.P. device on relatively flat ground and Bethesda believes in minimalist documentation of game features, this is not very widely known yet.  
---
I accidentally discovered it by building at a cliff edge overlooking a pool a couple months ago.  My current camp is at the higher peak of Seneca Rocks and takes pretty good advantage of the camp height rules to give me access to a patch of dirt just below for farming purposes.
---
You can request a refund on their support site, I did the same thing last night with the rose dress and sent a ticket
---
But I don't actually like you
---
I would shut down, but since I had to take turns entering every chassis I own just to pick it up and it froze on the first one I want to see if I can hold out long enough for my friend to come and save my armor, otherwise I'll have nothing.
---
1. My shotgun is way better aoe and dmg and 1 shots everything save for SBQ. Same goes for my minigun/gatling when spamming.
---
2. lol
---
3. How many missiles to kill a lvl 80 SB? I know it takes my rifle 1 shot.
---
Even though I dont agree, Your comment was very entertaining, well wrote good sir! 
---
One other way to get some acid is to do The Path to Enlightenment event (the one at the Landview lighthouse where you collect fluid from fireflies to summon the mothman). Each firefly can also drop a firefly abdomen which gives 1 acid. If you start it early and don't submit all the fluid until the last moment you can gather quite a sizable quantity for how long the event takes. I made 35 acid in 13 minutes of chasing and punching fireflies.
---
I appreciate the thought.
---
Yes, I mentioned Lucky Hole Mine in the guide and in the video :-)
---
Claiming the munitions workshop is a good idea. I personally don't bother since the output nerf but for some people it would be a good plan
---
Where can we find a dirty tan suit?
---
I tried to server hop thrice at the Capitol building but didn‚Äôt encounter any...
---
I want to see how the different PvP mechanics play out.
---
Vs mugging lowbies and pacifists?
---
Standing up a full out pvp environment is what bored folks need.
---
A chance to really see who brings their A game vs, the I got more toys then brains.
---
Folks who lose will always blame others for their own mistakes.
---
Not bad, I‚Äôm always in a deficit lol. It‚Äôs too easy to see a something and be like ‚ÄúYou know what, I *do* need the plans for a swanky bearskin rug‚Äù
---
That's actually pretty bad dps.
---
You mean a *feature*
---
Bubbles is directly above the crafting area in the white spring. Take the elevator at the end of the hall by the empty counter to get there easily.
---
Not sure, but wondering about how much Fallout 4 Code is in this FO76.
---
Can‚Äôt highlight and delete, like in Fallout 4 (once Workshop claimed, so - how to delete, if at all?)
---
__
---
If it is true, Fallout 4 Code in FO76 seems just ...
---
WRONG.
---
I confirmLvl 50 bunker buster + rank 5 demo expert is viable against cargobots. A dozen or so missiles seriously gimps them
---
The raw dmg increase from BB might be bigger than the 2shot affix on a lower lvl launcher or maybe even on lvl 50 now that bethesda is tuning TSE.
---
Any math wizard with insight here?
---
They are lower dps than pistols, lol. There is no point in using them.
---
They just don‚Äôt know better. Then they go online, read the hysteria that is this sub most of the time, and convince themselves that everyone is cheating and ruining the game. So silly. 
---
You're spot on about a lot here, especially about most of the melee weapons being useless. I have to disagree about the ski sword though. As far as damage/weight ratio it's one of the best melee weapons that is accessible to most players, and can add armor piercing or bleeding damage. The Black Diamond version stands out even more because of the STR bonus. It's a great option especially as a backup for players that are not primarily melee, and can't justify carrying a 20 lb super sledge just for playing whack-a-mole-rat. Blade of Bastet is another choice that is on par, depending on the item level.
---
Sharpened pick-axe is actually pretty decent as well for a two handed and you can get them anywhere. Same with mole-miner gauntlet if you are going unarmed. Are these top end-game weapons? Of course not. But people have to use something before they get to end-game level stuff, and things that are common and a decent compromise on stats turn out to be pretty useful.
---
Agreed. These weapons should stay useless and no one use them except for role players.
---
Just what I want in a RPG.
---
We just need to keep upvoting this topic so Beth can see and put it in their queue
---
With no damage perks your going to struggle to stay effective. 
---
Take some of your crafting perks out, they can be swapped in to craft and free up some space for more combat perks
---
Aid weighs way more than ammo you'll be better off with travling pharmacy than the ammo one.
---
The rads from canabal add up fast. You may want to consider changing it for good doggy/Cola nut or takung a perk to reduce rad intake like lead belly.
---
Energy weapons are generally weak in the game in its current state Probally don't worry about science at all. 
---
Thanks for the advice, the carrot didn‚Äôt work. This is really good spot too.
---
It‚Äôs fine though, I can probably get the resources to build a decontamination shower in a weeks time.
---
Raiders can suck my dick üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
My instigating explosive shotgun still wrecks me. I killed myself atleast 3 times yesterday.
---
Thanks! See you there maybe :) 
---
You so right
---
That is the worst rambling, incoherent analogy I have ever seen at no point were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this thread is now dumber for having read it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul. 
---
I felt the same way, and really tried using a bat with that mod, but it just was never as effective as I needed it to be.
---
Why it‚Äôs kinda fun
---
i was thinking a (COD: zombies) type of wave defense . in the same way were it gets progressively harder . and they could go other ways with it like adding legendarily every ten levels or something . possibilities for this game are endless they just need to listen to what the community wants . 
---
"You aren't supposed to fixate on one weapon and expect to use it forever. "
---
Uhh...huh?  I do this w/ shotties and it works just fine. Missile launchers are trash atm. Stop defending bad balance.
---
I would take it a step further and make it so Death From Above doesn't trigger when launching a nuke, so that people don't just run indoors. They should add in a flash and shockwave that reverberates across the map to freak people across the map out who may not have otherwise noticed a nuke being launched.
---
Most likely someone else dropped it there. I take all the t51 pieces I find, paint them with nuka paint and then leave them in Watoga all the time. Most likely you found someone who dumped their old camp piece. 
---
I think if you put the piece in your stash box, then take it out, the game doesn‚Äôt destroy the piece if you drop it. Haven‚Äôt tried myself but that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve heard. 
---
Thank you you should try it, it seams like something you would do
---
Idk if i wasn‚Äôt the first to think of this but that basically no one answered to this post and it just got one downvote makes me sad. I still think it‚Äôs a great idea. Instead of progressive thinking there could be a forth and back. Especially in fallout since most of the gamers are playing at least fallout 3 to 76 still. It can boost sales and would be a revolution to gaming. Idk about sales numbers but it would be artistically genius. 
---
Right now I‚Äôm fed up with Bethesda asking about fo 76 daily challenges and how they should look. I don‚Äôt care no one does. Every daily challenge that is not incorporated in the fallout lore or just basically 76 quests is an honest bummer. I‚Äôd pay fore lore. I‚Äôm a fallout gamer. I don‚Äôt play for atoms. Free to play? I don‚Äôt care either. Just don‚Äôt bullshit me with atoms. They have to find a way just generally to build up lore. And if 76 wasn‚Äôt the Moment to do so, when would that be? They are killing it right now. The whole franchise. I always said 76 is great. But I feel they‚Äôre taking away everything that it stands for. Not because of the money aspect but by the ridiculousness they produce content. 76 is a breaking point. That should be obvious. It‚Äôs online. But mostly evolving. You can evolve micro or macro. The next game most likely in 9 years won‚Äôt happen if you don‚Äôt go macro. All the criticism with fo 4 not being a real rpg I could accept and still love it but if you make a map 4 times as big without 4 times the head work than you are killing the whole franchise. That‚Äôs what my idea was about.  Let the scorched enter Boston or do anything. But you have to put it on another level. 
---
Or just using rifles, shotguns, heavy, melee, or unarmed. Why split your dmg perks and weight perks? Stick with one, carry multiples of that type - many do this just fine. it can't be done with trash weapon type like explosive tho.
---
I have some great memories of dayz where I played with random people for HOURS...some lead to friendship while others ended in some of the most brutal betrayals ive ever experienced.  it was awesome lol.  
---
At least you'll still keep your weapons and armor, I dont see the new mode having much effect, but there will be a lot of people laughing, and a lot of people crying.
---
I want a game mode where stashes are raidable (stronger buildings would be needed), no fast travel, and when you die; you wake up naked at vault 76
---
There are ‚Äònormal‚Äô frogs as well, and they give 2 uranium ore. Which super weird give the radtoads in the game that spawn near water.
---
Thanks for the these helpful advices.
---
Have an upvote for use of the word truncate. 
---
Mods didn't fit it on consoles...
---
The neon signs plan is sold at the BOS watoga vendor. It's the signs and letters plan for 9500 caps. 
---
&gt; since you'll only be carrying around a few weapons at a time.
---
Exactly... so you should forget about focusing on reducing specific categories of weapon weights when you can just take Bandolier and Batteries Included to reduce the weight of the ammunition for any weapon you happen to be using (unless you're one of those masochists who use explosive weapons despite their ammo weighing so much more than all other ammo types regardless of perks with no positive trade off in exchange) to give you freedom of weapon choice with the additional benefit of allowing you to store tons of PA juice.
---
No, but I can craft all the meds. You know, from doing events and getting rewards and from .. well. Playing the game.
---
Over abundance is not even close to the word I'd use. This game throws meds at you, literally. All of them.
---
Need meds? Like daddy-o and stuff? Farm the ghouls from anywhere.
---
Weight is really only a issue and I'll stand by this, for people who refuse to learn how to play differently than from fallout 4. But to each their own and I'm not going to tell people how to play. I don't think the fix was something that was anywhere near the top of what needed to be done more than people changing their mindset on how much shit they carry on them at any given time.
---
You know like fixing the out world elevators, infinite loading screens, crashes during the SBQ .. you know. Real fixes, or how about engine stability ... no .. no. We needed some weight reduced from a few chems people don't even need to horde. Yay~ /s
---
We're not going to see eye to eye on this.
---
the most frequently requested container types are equipment organization ones like weapon rack or armor display, and a refrigerator or chem / first aid trunk, stash like items. I want a junk dumpster. Buildable containers encompasses things we might put into the world like a cache to someone's camp, or items we might use in camps or TOWNS (A user suggested Teamwork Oriented Wasteland Neighborhood System) such as refrigerators and armor closets
---
Even if they did find a way to detect duped items it still will be impossible because months will have passed and duping has kinda ended(expect for a few) and it would be impossible to detect if a player got the item legit or duped even if they have stacks of said item. anything they come up with would just end up getting a lot of innocent players banned. As for carrying over players to survival.... in my opinion forcing a player to start over because of a few dupers would be terrible. the only way to fix this is to nerf certain legendaries and make all stackable  items have a stack limit and force all inventories to that limit when joining survival
---
Your OP legendary explosive shotgun doesn't count in this comparison and it is about to get a nerfhammer anyway.
---
Stop pretending that OP shit is the measure by which the game should be balanced.
---
Ah, yes. Everybody's first experience with Riverwood. Good times.
---
This would be neat in a normal mode, too
---
My favorite part is when I am playing as a woman, yet I grunt like a man 
---
 Maybe not if you have a TSE, but it is pretty decent otherwise.  Not sure how it will rank after the nerf and we don't know what the other 2 effects are.   It might even be AATSE, if that is even possible.
---
I'm testing it now. If u stay in the same server then you still can't drop it. Im server hoping now. Will post results
---
He's not a high enough level and you didn't even say the location. Look I'm on xbox if you're on xbox ill play with you later hit me up deadkiller680. I would not focus on levels until you've completed a bunch of quests and make sure to scrap your junk to reduce weight so you don't become over encumbered. To scrap junk go to any workbench and press x on xbox to scrap junk and put it in your stash. Fissure site prime is located on the bottom right of the map.
---
Edit: spelling error
---
What is your gameplay style goal?
---
Over time i have accumulated so much stuff, that i don‚Äôt recommend any points dedicated to getting more.  Like pharma or can do or even caps.
---
Even hard bargain should be secondary: you only need to swap it in when you are at a vendor; don‚Äôt build around it.
---
Most people build around a combat style, since they all require trade-offs: you can‚Äôt t be great at more than one thing.  If you love stealth, or sniping, or melee, you might consider buffing up the perks for that playstyle, and swapping in the crafting stuff manually in camp.
---
Finally, counter-intuitively, i recommend against pack mule.  Ironically, junk is the last thing you want to carry, since it is exactly what you lose when you die.  Losing 4x as much stuff sux 4x as much....  and when you get back to camp, guess what?  It wont fit, because the perk does not affect stash.  Now you have a perverse incentive to carry rather than store.  Backwards.  Happened to me.  ;). Got rid of it.
---
Good luck!
---
LMAO
---
76 made my list of worst launches in gaming history. I can‚Äôt believe all the missteps Bethesda made on this one. Truly has to be some sort of Guinness record for how NOT to do marketing and public relations. I think all that really clouds objectivity when evaluating the game itself.
---
I feel your pain. Same thing happened to me. Before the legendary nerf I had a Quad Gauss drop in White Springs only to have the servers crash. The chances of me ever finding that again are slim to none. 
---
Nuka paint is not atom shop paint. This is a marked atom shop piece found in the world. I have tried to accomplish this and cannot.
---
I see where your coming from, but you do not have to use your lvl 300 toon to play survival mode. If your affraid of losing caps, start a new survival mode only toon! No old caps to waste! Or if you have a friend to help you, you could transfer all your caps to another "mule" toon for safe keeping. Im planning on starting a new toon for survival mode and only using my old toon occasionally for high stakes fights with a faction my group finds itself at war with. 
---
Jeez, could you be more toxic please?
---
Inside Emmet Mountain disposal are super mutant body parts you can pick up. Next time bring a head with you. Drop it off first. Then get weird. 
---
I'm level 53 and just tried trading for the first time last night. A mildly annoying guy showed up at my workshop and started asking to trade. I was like "what the hell" and accepted. I barely had started to look at what he had when he canceled. Like he wanted something specific and I didn't have it. 
---
Then he killed me and took the workshop, and stole my junk.
---
Always just bought one from the whitesprings fancy clothes protectron vender.
---
I'm testing with vault tec
---
The new sim settlements conqueror mod just came out. Didn‚Äôt have the biggest team but got it done. That‚Äôs not a good argument, but it shows something like this could be done. 
---
And I said most likely it won‚Äôt happen. I was going for something in general. They have to do something in the big picture. You cannot just make a bigger map with better ray lights and a lot of nice daily events. That‚Äôs not fallout. Why would I creep for legendaries if all I can do is wander round and kill more for more legendaries? This is death. 
---
Ok I‚Äôll check it ou thx
---
Have you not heard the robobrains talk. They are mean as fuck. Probably made the wendigo kill itself. 
---
Nice, let me know. I'm currently at work and can't test myself right now.
---
My bearskin ate away precious turret space, so I had to get a fancy rug instead. 
---
I think the assault rifle should have a massively improved ammo capacity and maybe slightly buffed damage so that it's maybe only a little weaker than the HM. I'm talking closer to heavy automatics capacity, like 100-200, so that its gimmick is that it needs to be reloaded (far) less often than any other rifle.
---
This is why i spam x on those dead bastards like a fuckin mad man. You could always try buying Skyrim across multiple platform and in VR, also sacrifice a goat or some poultry to Todd Howard and Pete Hines.........It may improve your drops
---
 Try building on top of them. A fair bit of stuff gets eliminated by the CAMP bulldozer feature. 
---
Asking for updates on a developing product which someone paid money for? No, that is the opposite of entitled. It's a reasonable request.
---
That's a fair counter point, but I'd like them to be more in line with other weapons like the death claw gauntlet at least.
---
I had to stop myself from walking off my power station because they almost convinced me that it could be stolen for a while. Hell I still feel weird trading even though people being able to steal from you has been debunked. That shit is contagious if you‚Äôre not careful to check sources and verify. 
---
I would like a message log too!
---
Thanks, I will keep these in mind. I was planning to create a roleplay build like Scavenger-Crafter-Cannibal-Coward. But looks like I need to think about end game also.
---
Bethesda might impress us and give us both. No effort design and production wise but with enough technical issues and bugs that it can hinder the rest of development. 
---
I wonder if someone just used the power armor station and was able to craft on the wild spawn. It's an interesting anomaly.
---
I think BOS combat tbh
---
Psychological warfare is the deadliest warfare because you have no resistances
---
I‚Äôve see it at both Watoga vendors
---
That will do it. I think I had just hit 40 and built a fresh assault-rifle and modded it all out. I got about two hours out of it and found a decent handmade and pretty much never used the assault rifle again.
---
That's amazing! Great job!
---
Because there are 100000 of them + listening to someone drone on about why you should immediately care about their problem over a 30 second speech. 
---
This lets them do 0 character development, portray quests at their absolute barebones objective with no reactions whatsoever (which has been a staple of fallout games) and zero player development. My character is even more of a stoic mannequin I control like a puppeteer. 
---
This such a simplistic way of trying to stitch together a story works for you then that‚Äôs great - but I‚Äôve found it extremely unimmersive and most of the quests are just so droll.
---
Nope bone stock excavator, no mods.  That would explain it if it was the case though.
---
That -3 strength -3 endurance though.
---
I'm not going to make another character just for survival mode. I'm not even a fan of the PvP in this game in the first place. The mechanics are so easily abused by groups that it will make survival mode a joke if they don't change them. 
---
Things like being able to run up a bounty without having any caps on you just to bait people, being able to bypass the new respawn mechanic with fast travel to party members, being able to give all your caps to a friend at a moment's notice, being able to go to a friend's camp and punch a wall to get a 10 cap bounty so you don't lose any caps when you die. It's a mess. It only punishes solo players which is how I play most of the time. 
---
I found that encounter just south. Thankfully, I just conveniently happened to have an instigating experimental MIRV on me...
---
I did try to accomplish that last night, but couldn't as it was greyed out. There were other pieces on the suit that were there, but access to modifications we're impossible.
---
i just got that part now "moving around camps to get different types of spawn" YESSSSS OMG! so you have a reason to want to move your base to certain areas of the map to get waves of specific enemies .
---
i'm always hearing chickens. Day and night. They cluck and cluck and cluck and taunt me. 
---
Still no VTU Jacket. Anyone else have any luck? Or an extra maybe? Or hints on the best way to farm the events?
---
Well, Windows didn't find my GPU after Fo76 crashed for a short period of time.
---
I agree. This would be be a simple quality of gaming improvement.
---
All-around without legendary effects it's BoS Combat Armor or Marine Armor.
---
Well, I sure I have! Several of them. 
---
The radium rifle mods all have a very low learn chance. Other weapons have mods with very low learn chances, just not typically all of the mods.
---
I've been using a ghoul slayers + explosive assault rifle. And it's decent. Explosive makes any gun workable. 
---
However what I LOVE about the assault rifle is that it looks totally different to all other guns. Everything else looks fairly standard. But the AR looks like a beast. 
---
Not really, at least on xbox. I can't speak for other platforms. But when they do, it's usually in popular areas like whitespring. 
---
Yes I've read this, legendary weapons would be the only thing I would trade, but fear of losing large amounts of caps I've stayed away.
---
Never been to Riverwood. Or heard of it.
---
Yup yup. On top of the giant stone mountain just south of harpers ferry. Two skeletons with a leash and dog bowl and sometimes.... a dog. :)
---
Bethesda will never let this happen.
---
I am all for a universe where Obsidian develops West coast fallout games and Bethesda develops East coast. 
---
Maybe put parts on the frame and see if that gets it craftable? Now I'm interested.
---
Perk packs are almost totally useless. The concept that you get extra cards without needing to level is cool, but in practice it's like you say: I just end up with a bunch of dupes I don't want or have already maxed out.
---
Handmade, steadier rate of fire and with right mods practically non existant recoil. Larger magazine size, higher dps on both semi and fully auto. Higher dps on prime semi and fully auto recievers. Also its basically an Ak47 and not a 1950's muffler with a  .30 cal browning reciever wannbe slapped on lol
---
Maybe it will get better soon with an influx of new blood, as we all know the game is going f2p.  /s 
---
Love this analogy! So true!
---
I had the same issue and I jumped out of my Excavator Armor and did exactly what they said. Took two tries but it worked.
---
The game you are looking for is called The Outer Worlds and got announced a couple of weeks ago.  
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGLTgt0EEqc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGLTgt0EEqc)
---
When in doubt, run to white springs. Always. 
---
Test failed. But i'm pretty sure they did the mentioned exploit but put it on the chassis instead of dropping it.
---
It's worth mentioning that Bethesda is aware of the exploit and called it a terms of service violation which could lead to anyone with paint that they didn't buy getting suspended or banned. There was a post about it the other day with the email(dude that bought some paint off someone asked them about it)
---
They said new content will be added to pve with the pvp update.
---
Now that's a spicy meatball!
---
100% but like you said most likely will never happen :/
---
It affects it by diverting resources and dev attention.  We don‚Äôt know how much, but logically more than zero.  Maybe just a little, but we fear it will be a significant portion.
---
It was indeed broken from the start.  People worry that too little repair too late will kill the game‚Äôs momentum.  So this distraction might literally wreck the vehicle.
---
Anyone find another way to get the plans? I have ran into Grahm almost two dozen times and never get a set. Beginning to think these may be the most difficult plans to find.
---
Lmao
---
I mean if we are just going to start turning this sub into r/gaming the anthem beta is up right now. 
---
Never say never.
---
Vendor pays like 20+ caps for that shit. It‚Äôs got a role. 
---
Good thing I made a clip of it then. I'll look into it more tonight.
---
It would be better if perk packs actually just didn't give you cards you already had. Once in a great while it actually is useful to get a free rank-up, but I'd rather just have it guaranteed to give me all new cards.
---
you complete the brotherhood of steel story line in the game. and you will come across technical data while looting safes drawers etc, and a quest will pop up on the top right of the screen telling you where to go and turn it in at. But ya I kind of agree with you. 
---
I've seriously defended this game SO MUCH, but this comment totally shows I paid full price for an alpha state game üòÇ
---
Bethesda is actually as bad as the haters have been saying all along
---
more like after level 25
---
&gt; qol or basic functionality for a MMO?
---
Neither: it's just plain old functionality. Radaway fit the definition from the start but the weight reduction just didn't function with respect to the item as it should have.
---
I think the Explosive Legendary effect should be removed or nerffed to a degree, and the damage buffed on explosive weapons in general. I **WANT** to carry an explosive, but the same effect on my Gauss rifle is better. Also the ammo is TOO F$%KING heavy. Without investing in a ton of perks, you are no going to be carrying around 50+ missiles, Mini-Nukes etc.  
---
No point according to my support ticket. My Account name was my email and I got quite a shock when people were calling me by my personal 20ish year old email and not MrHappy, luckily for PC players changing account names is as easy as a ticket. Now Im just a lost little cat with a Melee, Sniper, and Heavy named character line up
---
How will it make it "better"? It hasnt even been released. You have no way of knowing.
---
Oh, really, boycott them? THEY ALREADY HAVE THE MONEY FROM THE GAME PURCHASE.
---
I'm imagining since you're so incensed about the game that YOU BOUGHT IT as well, which means they also have your money. Boycott? You're an idiot.
---
Honestly? Im considering moving. After lucky hole mine I never need lead anymore.
---
Really wanted to say something like "your moms ass" but you can find a shit tonne in the little groves with pink trees all around fissure site prime in the cranberry bog area. Also if you know of that road and the tunnel underneath ssid road that goes from fissure sight area and watoga to the north, theres another shit tonne there üëç

No, OP is dedicated to Fallout. However, my heart goes out to Obsidian, even if those players/coders no longer are employed. R.I.P. FONV  (*and the DLCs*) was the pinnacle of the Fallout Universe, into 2019.

I seem to be having the same issue. Have you tried another character ?
---
Yknow, after Feed The People's machines ATE MY 350 SHOTGUN SHELLS, I've had trouble with my shotgun ammo. This will help. Cheers.

If there wasn't any problems with the game at the start plus all the exploits, glitches etc then yes the devs would of given us the content. However it's better to fix a broken game now rather than ignoring it otherwise new content will bring even more bugs adding to the ones we have already. I personally would not have PvP added in however it was stated that there was an element of PvP in the game and let's be honest what we have isn't good. Give the minority what they need to carry them on, then focus on the PvE side of things. I just hope they don't mix the two too much and balance the game at the cost of one style over another.
---
*neckbeard intensifies*
---
Well the mode is is obviously optional, but there wont be any bounty system in survival mode. All other players will just be marked as hostile. I think it will pretty much eradicate all the unfair advantages that the bounty system causes. If I were you I would go back to Fallout 4 or 3 and wait for a new single player installment to the series, because  it sounds like youd rather not interact with other players at all. 
---
If it's a secret why would I tell you 
---
This is brilliant.  Take my upvote!
---
Beavers too
---
I‚Äôm camped at the acid/lead spot. Was tricky to place. Was a pain with the SB before, but now it‚Äôs just an annoyance as I can usually 2 or 3 shot it now.
---
Is that cooked all the way?
---
Idk.
---
Fuk it I‚Äôm Nukin‚Äô the mfr.
---
I've been playing multiplayer video games online for decades, kiddo.
---
I think no random legendaries would be good, but there‚Äôs Legendary weapon rewards for quests. This way Bethesda controls what legendaries there are so they can not put in overpowered combos, and everyone can get them.
---
You can get a handmade recipe from harpers ferry between around lvl 15 and 44
---
Sad to say, only at 550.  Wait...said to admit that.
---
 You probably have hardware problems developing if that happened. I seriously doubt the game had anything to do with it, other than exposing the developing problem..
---
I just messed around testing myself. If you take a power armor suit with atom shop painted pieces and put the entire chassis in your stash box, when you pull it out, it no longer has the atom shop symbol. I think you might be able to drop that chassis without it being destroyed. But I haven‚Äôt gone that far in testing it. 
---
No.
---
If you don't want to appear on the map, sneak.  I might choose to show up on the map.  A trap maybe.
---
What's the rationale behind no level scaling? 
---
Nice trick with the slanted roof to get to the half-height floor. Been looking for a way to do that.
---
List of Heavy Weapons Issues:
---
Every time you switch to Gatling Plasma it's ammo is set to the number of plasma cores you have.
---
Gatling Gun's sight (when modded on) is off to the side, doing nothing for aim.  Intentional?
---
Gatling Gun ROF has an extra 0 or something.
---
Crafting Flamer ammo is ridiculously expensive.  10 acid, 5 oil, and 2 steel for FIVE rounds.  Is this missing a 0?
---
Autonade no longer affected by bear arms.  Intentional?  Is it suppose to be a rifle?
---
And of course the gatling laser, plasma, and minigun especially, but basically all big guns (other than the gatling gun and .50) break really fast even with gunsmith and lucky break.  Like within 2-3 reloads fast.
---
I am glad that this announcement is exciting.  But I admit I don‚Äôt understand exactly why.  You can kill a person now.  Why wait?  Apparently there are many people right now excited about pvp.  Why not hunt them down, figuratively and then literally?  Doesn‚Äôt hunter/hunted provide this?  What can you do in the new mode that you can‚Äôt today?
---
I was only testing with 1 piece. Your way might actually work for this..
---
If you hover over the callenge you will see you need to pick very specific flowers, such as "carrot flowers" and "melon bloom". I haven't tried any of these specifically but I noticed when I picked up some soot flowers and it didn't update, just thought I'd let you know.
---
I found a bunch one day got a couple pics of me and dead cats really wish I had my clown outfit.
---
Yes, a time table so people can decide how to invest their time is so spoiled and entitled üòÇ 
---
I imagine it must be hard for Bethesda to fix this game all on their own. It's not like they've just been relying on moders to fix their broken shit for a decade or more. 
---
And I'm pretty sure you should be talking to the people at Obsidian if you're concerned about what it feels like to have your vision of this world bastardised. It becomes more and more obvious with each passing week this game was an alpha state game, sold at full price, with a team that had next to no idea how to manage or maintain it
---
Yeah with my second character there seems to be no problem... just my main. I don‚Äôt know why 
---
auto nade is the saddest what about M79
---
 I'm quite sure its level 15 to 20 as I just did this, and I can tell you it don't drop outside of those levels. How do I know? Wallace is a close personal friend. ;)
---
Well no wonder the game was bugged to high hell and when they fixed the bugs it caused more bugs and then after that players started cheating fucking up the games in game market by getting reticules amounts of items. This wouldn‚Äôt have happened and we would have content if Bethesda delayed the game for a few mounts to fix the game 
---
But that not something I can test. I'd lose the paint somewhere in my 30 chassis and I'm not tryna drop all those to find it
---
Yeah like those distress signals you could activate at radio towers in 4, where you hunt down the location by signal strength

I‚Äôve tried almost every flower you can pick for the challenge. Nothing has updated
---
Meh, in the day of shared accounts its not the big of a deal
---
To late. I got impatient and did it at 30
---
Bethesda, I have loved and played basically all your games. I was very unimpressed with your decision to add creation club and now this, a barely functional and boring free roam. You guys are in a desperate grab for cash and your gonna find yourself in a whirlpool of desperately trying to get money by any means possible and eventually no one will buy your games and that will be it for you. Make good games that people can enjoy, be the Bethesda we love with your incredible solo RPG's. And for God's sakes upgrade your engine. 
---
I thought I'd stumbled into r/fallout for a second. 
---
 Its BOS Heavy Combat as far as I know. Its a bit better than my Excavator Power Armor I never use.;)
---
It happened to me the other day, but i went to bed and when I woke up it worked again. Try that character again in a few hours and it should be fixed.
---
I restarted my comp and it seems to be running better now. Odd bug 
---
Yeah that‚Äôs about where I decided to stop too. 
---
I don‚Äôt know why this bothers me too but it does... 
---
I dunno, seems a bit too easy to use for trolling. Maybe instead just show the epicenter where the actual bomb will drop, and not the red affected area until after it drops.
---
Then you‚Äôve got the ‚Äúam I too close‚Äù anxiety as well as the occasional ‚Äúcool I‚Äôm gonna hop close for pics and first dibs on loot... whoops too close‚Äù
---
Im pretty sure the more people there the more buffed the queen becomes, so if people aren‚Äôt pulling their weight they are in-fact making it harder for you
---
She has a curve table making it harder the more people who are there.  
---
So if you have multiple people doing little or no damage the other need to work significantly harder to take we down 
---
They also said you wouldn't realize there was servers and it had 10x the detail of fo4. 
---
They presumably lose nothing like how it works in adventure mode.
---
Me: Picks up mini-nukes.
---
Also me: Throws all mini-nukes on the floor.
---
thats not how business works.
---
What kind of products are you talking about? Games don't ship in a broken and incomplete state so that Devs can build for a community. If they want to do this they release an early access, with an early access price tag and with a 0.X version, not 1.0.
---
Pretty sure they trigger if you travel to the region. 
---
 LOL. Two guns I will never use. They suck mightily. 
---
 Well I guess you can build a decent Combat Rifle but why? There are so many better guns.
---
What would The Elder Scrolls do with Fallout?
---
You know there's another option:
---
* make weapons and armor drop on kill in Survival* 
---
That way the TSE guys can certainly bring their duped BS in but they can lose it to the legit players that plan and gang up on them.  Either that or they keep their TSE nonesense off the survival servers.  Either way the legit players win.
---
As a legit player I'll take the risk of losing a weapon that I can just craft again for a shot at a rare legendary.
---
In short, "turn the (duper) assholes into interesting content"
---
Perhaps even carry this over such that Legendaries- only drop in adventure mode.
---
I have the same suspicions, up until recently when myself and good handful of people on the server were able to take her down more often than not. 
---
Myself and the rag tag group of people have joined the event with the 3 or 4 times haven‚Äôt came close. 
---
IMO at the point other than the novelty factor, the quest is a waste. The amount of resources expended to take her down weighed against the potential rewards is far from breakeven for me.
---
Yes I need some cool roofs designs 
---
Most disappointing legendary.
---
Until you get a 1-star rolling pin.
---
Here's my proposal. I don't imagine many people care what I think, but I think there's actually a pretty decent way to implement Survival alongside the existing Adventure mode. 
---
1. Existing characters are given the option to join Survival mode at any time via a toggle in Settings, accessible from the lobby. **Just like Survival mode in FO4, once a character enters Survival mode, THEY CANNOT GO BACK TO ADVENTURE MODE.** I think this would make people think twice about putting their "best" or main character in Survival because it would lock them out of being able to team up or trade with Adventure-mode players, who I think will continue to form the majority of the player base. 
---
2. In conjunction with #1, **Survival mode could be level-gated**. Perhaps only players level 5+ (don't harm the vault babies), or maybe as a reward upon completing the Raider quests. Putting it at the end of the Raider questline would not only ensure that everyone has access to a base set of equipment, but it also makes sense thematically. 
---
3. This next bit might be complicated in terms of server-side implementation, but IANA Programmer so I really have no idea. However, I think it would be very beneficial to implement some degree of **level-matching within servers**. Even if it's just a matter of grouping players into 50-level tiers, I think it would go a long way towards creating a playing field that feels relatively balanced -- especially for leaderboard purposes. 
---
4. **Determine the amount of items dropped upon death by weight**, make it a percentage of the total amount that the downed player is currently carrying, and include weapons in that percentage. If you die and you're carrying a rifle, a pistol, and 100 pounds of junk, why should you lose the majority of what you're carrying? As compared to someone who is carrying 200 pounds worth of missile launchers, gauss rifles, and stimpacks and no junk whatsoever, this makes the cost of PVP much higher for the player who is at the greatest disadvantage. If you have a system by which you lose, for instance, 10 pounds of randomly selected items for every 100 pounds of carry weight (rounded to 2 decimal places), you might lose a pile of steel or a chunk of lead...but you might also lose your level 50 cultist dagger. It introduces a sense of danger and risk for players who otherwise would just stash their junk and go on a bloody rampage. You could even put a new perk under the Luck tree that reduces the amount of junk you drop on death, or excludes certain items like favorited items or Chems. 
---
5. **Divide the leaderboards** into "Responders" and "Raiders" -- AKA White Hats and Black Hats. For every player who wants to be a villain, there are two who want to be heroes. Give the Responders points for things like collecting bounties on Wanted players, reviving other players, building C.A.M.P. or workshop items, etc. Give the Raiders points for player kills, destroying C.A.M.P. items, and picking locks on owned objects -- the things that already make them "wanted." Both sides would get points for claiming workshops for their "team" and holding them for a set period of time. This would give players who are more inclined to think of themselves as "helpful" a reason to join Survival, which would generate enough conflict to keep things interesting. Want to add more factions? Reward Brotherhood members for crafting high-tech weapons/armor and trading them with other players; reward Free Staters for scrapping junk, cooking food, collecting meat from animals, and harvesting crops; reward Enclave members for killing Scorched, legendary enemies, and launching nukes. 
---
Those are my thoughts, hopefully they spark other ideas and feedback for Bethesda. 
---
Lol, half of all that is technically impractical.
---
You have to think of the servers as temporary, you have to assume they are stable in your suggestions.
---
I found a level one legendary chicken. He dropped legendary gear too!!
---
Same. Lmao
---
So you think all these horrible design decisions were intended?
---
Remove disc, walk to garbage can, place disc in trash.  Solved! 
---
I think that's the point he's making, there's currently no reason to use them so add more mods to them so there is a reason.
---
I get the same problem black screen infinite loading screen at least once a day
---
Survival should have no fast travel.  Survival.  Not magic medevac.
---
One can only hope.
---
So a game can't crash a system? All I know is that other games run fine. Only Fallout disconnects. And it isn't just my internet going down. But whatever, I'll just switch games and come back if they ever fix most of the issues...
---
I pulled a group into the main golf course gate robots. While screaming like a little girl I might add. 
---
For sure, all I ask is for the option to put over hang on the flat pieces and tall side pieces like the slants, the option to change the walls  to the same kind as wall it's attached to and inverted corner pieces. There's been far too many times where my entire base had to change just because there weren't enough roof options there 
---
Wendingos seem like the result of an artist at Bethesda wondering what would emerge if a Deathclaw shacked up with a Ghoul. It's just the two creatures merged together. 
---
No joke, those things are powerful and soak up bullets. Trying to put on your clown outfit for the challenge before it rips you to shreds is a good time.
---
leaded is for radiation.  dense is torso only and is for explosive.
---
I have a two shot 10mm SMG with prime.  It's pretty useful. Getting flux is actually a lot easier than I originally thought it would be. Especially for the 10mm since it requires yellowcake which can be found around the edges of the blast zone at whitespring. 
---
If you use green thumb for 2x plants and super duper + ammosmith for crafting its doable.
---
Except the Legendary usually pops up on the screen displaying the item and name after the list decipates. Otherwise, you right haha
---
I definitely want like more types of roofs like over here in Florida we have like ceramic roofs sorta I think that‚Äôs what they are and they look so nice 
---
They attempted to fix this a few patches ago. Apparently it did not get fixed.
---
Don‚Äôt even joke bro lol, yeah anti armor might overtake tse‚Äôs after nerf.

I have a quad gauss in my store if you‚Äôre on PS4
---
Explosive shotguns will still be far more powerful than missile launcher.
---
All rifles will still be far more powerful. All melee. All unarmed.
---
Missile launcher, like many other guns in this game, is shit and needs buffs.
---
That was my point more or less :) 
---
Shhhh people don't like the truth here. Pvp is not much of a thing because the game pretty much punish it and discourage it, I'm sure there will be a lot more pvp if it was more free-fight. 
---
The meta for both pve and pvp need to be adressed asap tho because I'm not playing against people with god-rolled legendary weapons when the game give me silencing pitchfork from the queen.
---
I think the defense value of the power armor also need to be lowered when in pvp as it just a boring high ttk and stimpack spamming fight like right now.
---
It sucks :( it just recently started doing it
---
yea I def had lead issues for a long time.  tin can chimes have solved that.  still, point remains! 
---
Asking for updates is not the same as asking for a year long roadmap and saying you‚Äôll be unable to buy atom if you aren‚Äôt guaranteed a year of playability. What the fuck
---
Great for you, many of can say the same. It doesn't mean adding survival to Fallout 76 will make it better. That was poor reasoning. Calling me kiddo doesn't make you sound smarter or older.
---
"I've been playing video games for decades so I must know what I'm talking about." 
---
PC. I appreciate the offer though.
---
Oh yeah that'd be super cool, like a shingle option too even
---
Did you get it back?
---
Yep after the patch that suppose to ‚Äòfix‚Äô infinite loading screen 
---
No, how does a pipboy know where players dozens of kms away are? But it can't display super mutants or scorched? It's metagame crud that breaks immersion.
---
I think you demanding a time table so that people like you can complain more and dictate this and that, or change whatever you want, makes you self entitled. Yes.
---
Game is fun with non-legendary .45 Pipe Revolver builds. Pfft. ;-P
---
 The SMG is fatally flawed. I guess you could, as I said, make a decent Combat Rifle but I run my .45 through my Lever Action and my Handmade takes care of all the midrange stuff so well.
---
 The LMG runs .308 and is a POS as well. 
---
I am pretty sure that pretty much anyone who compares lives with someone that plays fallout 76 for eight hours a day every single day is going to come out the winner there. 
---
Yeah. This happens a lot. 
---
Make sure you have the soldier's certificate in your inventory and not stash and it should work
---
Bethesda probably didnt think anyone would have gotten that high this fast.
---
That or it's a feature, not a bug.
---
Pipe weapons forever: Fallout made, Fallout Proud!
---
:-)
---
&gt; That might be true but it doesn't refute what the OP is saying: Having  to micro-manage inventory or take a bunch of extra perks for weight  really does not make the game more enjoyable. 
---
You have a point if you ignore everything I said.
---
I'll bold.
---
&gt;...OP is saying: **Having**  to micro-manage ...
---
You don't have to. You CHOOSE to.
---
Choice and consequences.
---
How can you tell it's a worlds first?
---
If it tells you in the video I havent seen that part yet.
---
Pipe weapon builds: let‚Äôs be Fallout primitive and proud! :-)
---
Where did u get that couch?ü§î

You don't. I have two big tents sitying in the grass on my land plot.

That guy just posted on the PS4 trade discord advertising his shop. Can you give me some info so I can contact an admin?
---
Heres to hoping i find one. Im sure they are great but need one to use one. 
---
I'm a simple man. I see destiny, I downvote.
---
Put everything in stash or on urself
---
They increased it to six hundred. The problem with stash storage is server strain. Unless you'd rather a single server like elite dangerous, with the mechanics of conan exiles (you log out, your body remains in game)  but, single server means less strain.. for some reason. 
---
Sorry if this is a stupid question, but what do you mean with comp? 
---
Thats what I figured but it didn‚Äôt seem this bad before the recent update 
---
Today it was 5/6 of us and I did a quarter of her health with my 3 star bat but then got overwhelmed and ran out of stimpacks 
---
Try storing all junk in your stash and then trying it. Sometimes I can't craft stuff with the materials on my person, but I can if they're in the stash
---
At lvl 109 I'm burnt out on this game its lost all its luster. 
---
I‚Äôm innocently asking, would it be difficult to implement? 
---
They don't exactly have a choice. It's a game as service. They need people to buy more copies.
---
So few words, illustrate such a well informed opinion.
---
Thanks! I‚Äôll try that and reply if it works or not

What info do you need? My psn is KranickTV if it helps. He said he was trading a suit of power armor for TSE weapons. he takes the weapon and doesn't drop the power armor. He just leaves the server. He robbed me and 1 other guy that I know of. If you look at his Reddit profile you will see the messages of us calling him out. Do you have the discord link? I'll go there myself and confront him
---
Probably or probably not but there definitely just trying to focus on fixing and making the game better so I understand if it takes a bit
---
I totally want that inverted corner 
---
I noticed in the BETA it was a tiny bit buggy (weird collision, wouldn't stay on) but it played the music and it worked pretty much the way it did in FO4. The next day, it was missing. I couldn't find it in my CAMP, I couldn't find it in the build menu.
---
It's disappointing, to say the least.
---
Sledgehammer. Kills a windigo in one hit. 
---
 What other online games run well for you? Now the game's servers crap the bed on a regular basis so disconnects are common, but I have never heard of anyone having their entire connection trashed.
---
For me that didn‚Äôt fix the problem sadly, as this was already one day ago since it started. Will reinstall this garbage again tomorrow, hope it goes well. Do you have to do some sort of backup or does the game automatically show your characters again after reinstalling? 
---
Loving NON-PA build with second character.
---
but offer is still same. I can trade right now. TSE Handmande or 10k, m?
---
I run a prime anti-armor Gatling gun when I do the queen. Prime on the Gatling gives a solid damage boost.

Glad to make that happen for you!!

they are saved server side so they should all be there with no changes once you sign into your account

&gt; Having the only choice you make be what weapon you use is boring - I don‚Äôt want to just play a shooter - I want more substance to my character than that.
---
Which is ironic since it's those dull binary selections that dictate your choices for you. 
---
If you want to use heavy weapons or shotguns without massively gimping yourself it's mandatory to invest tons of points in strength just to be able to use a few of the damage increasing perks in the SPECIAL stat that easily has the highest number of worthwhile "optional" weight reduction perks. 
---
If you want to use rifles you better pump Perception. What's that? You don't care for the VATS and all the other dinky little cards? Too bad if you want your rifles to at least do shit for damage you better put in those Perception points.
---
Want to actually be able to make use of mutations? Well there goes another 2 "non-mandatory" mandatory skill points you gotta put in Luck for Starched Genes.
---
Yeah, ive got a tse for ground to air attacks. But otherwise once they land I hit em once with the hammer and they die.

He posted on the shops channel
---
But hey, they are hard at work making a PvP server type
---
That's how it works
---
They lied
---
There would be so many new build designs with just a few new roof pieces
---
You mean Vats Rifle servers. That's all it's going to be.
---
A group of 4 spawned near the ammo factory and ran into two of us with full x01 and sledgehammers. They died fast. 
---
I apologize if I offended anybody, that is not my intention, if they release a "road map" then you will have posts saying "what they're doing this?" Or "No, don't do that, do it how I want" as well as the hilarious posts that are basically trying to guide the developers to do it "this" way because the average keyboard jockey knows more than a certified game developer or programer.
---
You make mungo mad... MUNGO SMASH WHEN HE MAD *CRUSHES TABLE*
---
I don't think deep pocketed is learnable from scrapping, you need to buy/find the plan.
---
Man, I'm a Fallout veteran and even I forget to switch weapons for different enemies still..
---
I'm in the channel but I can't send a message? It says I don't have permission?
---
Nice. 
---
A replacement for the jet pack mod where it is just a back mounted tuba? That would be pretty great.
---
Fuck switching weapons. Sledgehammers kill everything in 1-2 hits. 
---
Just south of Winterspring ;)
---
Ive got a spiked fireaxe, rocket spiked sledgehammer and a flaming pitchfork. Everything dies in 1-2 hits for me (provided its under level 95)
---
I'd repeat my offer: 10k caps or TSE Handmade or great melee if you're interested. Let me know. IGN: LGeo
---
Because it was hardly tested at all
---
Fallout NV was perfect. I can return to fallout NV or Oblivion anytime and thoroughly enjoy then.
---
That ‚Äûshould‚Äú is the part where Iam scared lol. I don‚Äôt trust their servers. It‚Äôs either working or Iam loosing it all 
---
Do i miss the joke? It‚Äôs like saying kids in Africa have less to eat be happy with the potatoes you have?
---
Holy shit thank you so much, I've only seen Grahm sell it, take this upvote for being such a good help!
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure anyone‚Äôs life is better than a reddit troll, such as yourself
---
Well, I am in quite the moral potato, proving you wrong here. The post was deleted, and I don't know how to link someone's comment without making a new post.
---
You are welcome  and thanks for the upvote.
---
That‚Äôs actually how business work: disruptive capitalism. Build a niche that produces a new market. 
---
I agree 100% with this, obsidian did a great job and that's why Bethesda freaked out when NV was projected to be selling better than 3. Hell I hope some of the proceedings went to obsidian from them including 1 and 2 with 76.
---
Totally didnt waste a mini nuke or two when we first met and I thought he was a normal supe...
---
Seriously, I‚Äôm playing my second character/play through ‚Äî the way *I* always wanted: Pipe weapon (chose pistol/.45 revolver) and perks *I* want ... not what the world wants.
---
I‚Äôm so much more both at ease and more into Fallout immersion (as possible.)
---
Thank you
---
Dolly sods, 2nd floor behind a locked door, tattered mole outfit, unique find
---
Pistols work great with a high luck and agility critical build, so I don't know what you're even talking about. 
---
They are still in the game, they're just really rare to come across. 
---
Ugh I'm so jealous. I've been looking for the dress for so long. I've been non stop server hopping. Got the one for the skeleton but no luck with the dress yet. 
---
um.. what? your asking for Bethesda to give back the fallout license (not sell, give back) thats not how business works, I have no idea where on earth u got that shit from, but yeah Bethesda didnt get where it got today by giving away its owned licenses, you might need to go back to business school me thinks.
---
Oblivion is a TES game
---
They told you this game was a new experiment for Bethesda, so check your expectations.
---
My son just discovered that abomination this afternoon!
---
I crapped myself bc i was reading the scribes terminal at the top of the brotherhood mansion in the power armor room and one attacked me. Jesus, and here i thought i was alone.
---
I think the pvp is just to get the people focused on certain opposing things in different servers. If you have a group of people and they complain about wanting the exact opposite things (even if one group is significantly smaller) you seperate them or do your best. 
---
Probably because it seems lazy and obvious
---
Idr what the name of the plan was, something something seating. Came with other stuff too
---
Mod makers do like one thing and have zero accountability.  So gee, I wonder why the big company who is doing everything and have accountability took longer?
---
Try critical thinking+imagination instead of bleeting like a sheep. If you are depending on Bethesda to make the game better you haven't been paying attention for oh about 10 years now. 
---
&gt;Can we please get some sort of end game content added?
---
And on ps4 its 45% of players have never reached lvl 10 .. 70% of players have not reached 25 and 85% that have not reached 50. 
---
Those numbers can be interpreted as meaning that folks want to do more than just lvl and reach 'end game' 
---
Woo somebody noticed! I was proud of figuring that out. Also it complies with ADA requirements so it's got that going for it which is nice.
---
I‚Äôve used zero disease cures of any kind.  Diseases are common and the game is easy.  I carry one antibiotic for emergencies and never needed it.
---
They are still here... go to Huntersville and West-Tek...
---
If we trust trophy info ... on ps4 its 45% of players have never reached lvl 10 .. 70% of players have not reached 25 and 85% that have not reached 50. 
---
Text chat should‚Äôve been an official part of the game from the beginning so I personally don‚Äôt care if people use the mod, but keep in mind you could very well be banned or have your characters wiped and Bethesda wouldn‚Äôt be in the wrong for doing it.
---
This is cool btw.
---
Deathclaw gauntlet can‚Äôt be used with PA.  I stopped reading.
---
I‚Äôm not into *any* discord, but FONV (for those who really played it to completion + all DLCs) [although linear] continued to hold even Fallout 4 and 76 to this experience.
---
Behold the reviews.
---
Rifles do twice the dps in the same setup. Next patch it's going to be even worse, since TSE carries pistols atm.
---
The better alternative is to just ignore the disease until it goes away.
---
I want my navy blue and pink striped roof so badly
---
No, they don't, because the system is shit and difficult to figure out.
---
If you solely run around in PA there is no benefit to using armor weight reduction (I just keep all the armor I find that other people might think is worth trading for in the stash, which doesn't benefit from perks anyway, with the Ultra-Light mod on) only the specific PA weight reduction perk applies to PA and even then if you keep everything on the chasis it only weighs 10 lbs in the first place and if you only have 1 set on your person (literally the one that you're wearing) then it doesn't even weigh anything to begin with since any piece of worn PA along with any deployed chasis don't weigh a thing.
---
i didnt realize her health scaled..i thought it was just around 32k always
---
Ah the amount of hate I got in this sub at launch when i said the game has no end-game content....
---
I haven‚Äôt but probably only because I haven‚Äôt played this patch. Not surprised though.
---
Was your armor broken or just damaged before you repaired it? If it was broken, the server might have forgotten that you‚Äôd repaired it.
---
 "Try critical thinking+imagination instead of bleeting like a sheep."
---
You mean use some shitty build and make people groan during SBQ?
---
Confirming its still going on. 4 kills today 0 loot, but always has inventory weight. I tried shifting an item into the SBQ inventory, but no cigar. Still no loot.
---
because when trying to put out the fire thats consuming your home you dont start with the coasters
---
I feel like I'm one of the few people who likes the design of the Assault Rifle. Buuuut... The Handmade Rifle looks better and is far more useful. It was my go-to gun when I got Nuka-World.
---
Not to say I dislike the Assault, it's great. But I like the Handmade more.
---
Remember when nuke launches broke because the year changed from 2018 to 2019? My point is: total lack of foresight and a fix it later attitude.
---
Late reply but I agree 100%. 
---
Well said. 
---
It's accurate though, you only get a improved rate if you actually fire it
---
I found one with a bunch of others fighting a deathclaw in the mire. Iirc they drop you mini nukes even if you don't damage them
---
That would be awesome if I didn‚Äôt just use it on this one:
---
https://twitter.com/pilkro/status/1080663689609596928
---
That'd be interesting, on what type of walls?
---
Meh i already did the lvling but. Now i want to do the character min/max bit, but the issue is the game has the worst balance I've ever seen and it gets even worse next patch.
---
If you plan do not get hit often, bloodied prefix combined with adrenal reaction mutation and strange in numbers perk card. Also unyielding armour will help tremendously with sneaking and vats. If you don't want a low health build, armour piercing prefix for scorch queen, instigating for solo play. Either way definitely wear 1 piece of chameleon and the escape artist card.
---
Make sure you use armor pierce mag, prime receiver and tank killer perk if killing scorchbeasts and the like.
---
You can also get extra damage out of obviously the sneak multiplier perk card, the one that gives more damage with suppressors.
---
I would also reccomend you use vats for those sexy critical sneak auto headshots with 100% accuracy hits. 
---
Text mod has been a thing for a while. No one has been banned.
---
I had several that would have lasted 4 hours!!!! 
---
I did Huntersville twice, never saw one.  Bummer!
---
Oh man!
---
That is a great point maybe it was intentional 
---
yea but dont go spend more money on atoms. and leave the servers fully dead so they can even see that its so trash not a single person is playing it (pretty close to that anyway)
---
Oblivion is also a game company that developed fallout new Vegas 
---
You did her no harm so not a griefer just a playful player with a great sense of humor, bravo. Love people that just have fun and do wacky stuff that does not involve upseting people.
---
Even the murder house is funny. Griefers to me are more the school yard bully that thinks it's funny to destroy a lowbies CAMP.
---
I wish we had showers and other stuff that we could use at people camps.
---
Thanks for the replies, guys.  Now I gotta go find one.
---
Some things stack, others don‚Äôt , most things have a cap.  And all subject to change.
---
You're doing great sweetie
---
As other people are pointing out, they're still in 76. I'm glad they're rare though, nothing brought me more fear than that " beep beep beep" and having absolutely no idea where it was coming from...
---
West tek...  you suddenly do not miss them when you hear that unmistakable sound and are not sure where it is coming from
---
I know but it could still happen out of nowhere and no one can reasonably deny that that is possible. The only reason I don‚Äôt use it myself is because I don‚Äôt want to risk the ban or wipe, so I‚Äôm only posting this so people are aware. It would suck to get banned for this, even if it‚Äôs justified.
---
That's Obsidian. 
---
Be you. Unless PvO, or something else, is driving you belong your relaxation stage? /justwondering /goodluck

---
I will spam upvote this every time it arises.
---
its all true. took them forever to fix vanished camps and all that. still lots of bugs....canvas bag scam? fact. rum yes. 500 adam apology. players info and credit cards leaked. needing an apology essay to be unbanned even for visual mods. 20$ santa outfit. dev room debacle. constant patches that dont work. I can keep going. well least its fair making the game 10$
---
Please don't spread FUD, we want more people joining the community.  We've checked with the Bethesda Community Managers, and BGS won't ban you just for using the Text Chat mod.  To clarify, they do not officially support the use of mods, but that does not mean they will flag and ban mod-users.  
---
What they **ARE** flagging is active-memory-access mods , such as the Lock-Pick cheat mod.  Mods that do not access active memory, such as Text Chat or texture replacements, have no verified reports of being flagged or banning.  
---
some idiots still use the atom store. some idiots prob paid 20$ for the santa suit
---
So... there are molerats with bombs on them line the suicide mutants. Scariest shit yet when you don't expect it. 
---
 No.  It was clean head shot. Harvested the nuke. ;) 
---
 Fucking Westec! I went in drunk and got my ass kicked. It took at least an hour today to fix my fuckups.
---
Maybe they‚Äôre over nerfing tse to get people to ditch the weapons so there isn‚Äôt a stupid amount of them in circulation, then they‚Äôll make them balanced.
---
Did you know there are cats?
---
must be in salty denial cause ya spent the full 60$ and prob money at the atom store
---
Do you have friends?  Solo eventually won‚Äôt survive gangs.
---
It's on me. Still grayed out. No matter what tinkers bench i'm on 
---
I agree that‚Äôs the point of not showing your location on map so you could respawn at your camp if someone finds your camp just roaming around you will just have to relocate
---
Oh that's the best way to reference the song right there, lol. But next time you're dropping brown bags, and checking/repairing gear conditions at workshops, I hope the song plays in your head like it does mine.
---
I don't know how it happened but i think i accidentally threw it away x'(
---
So I literally just did what you suggested, and it worked like a charm! Thx
---
Unyielding armor pieces help.  I have 16 mutations and all my specials are still boosted 
---
Try West-Tek, I always seem to spawn between 1-2 Suiciders near the gate just past the player spawn point.
---
I can understand Bethesda wanting you to play when servers are available and online. But nothing is more frustrating than sitting down on the couch after a hard day at work and not being able to play the game you spent $60 on because the servers are having issues again. There is really no excuse for that. 
---
I doubt Bethesda will make any. They have a better ROI making a power armor skin and selling it on the atom store
---
If you placed another paper bag as close as possible to where you died (your last paper bag) and if no one has taken it and it hasnt fallen through the world you can teleport all your stuff into the new paper bag.
---
I found out about this trick in the beta when I fell through a wall and couldnt get out. Need up blowing myself up. Came back and put down a bag above where I died and the new bag had all my stuff in it. I've been using it ever since.
---
I‚Äôm not :) I‚Äôm giving a kind warning to anyone who wants to use the mod. There is a chance that it will end up being made bannable, and even though there would likely be a warning by Bethesda beforehand people should still be aware so they can make a decision with that in mind.
---
It‚Äôs just not a high priority.  Gotta test UI stuff across all platforms and resolutions and I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs on their list.
---
That beep was sure to give me the thrill, because it was one of the few things that could still kill me in the game.
---
Oh come on... a ghoul just has to look at you and you get rad worms. I find your statement very hard to believe unless you never play the game. I was in power armour, well fed, thirst topped up and running the tier 1 disease resist card. I still got a disease the second a mole rat bit me. When the game acts like this I absolutely do need to stack them.
---
Yea, seems like a good target ;)
---
Bugs taste worse than ghouls...
---
Nothing taste worse than ghouls brother...
---
Could be modes or junks that won‚Äôt scrap properly but still counts as material like baseball beer bottle etc
---
Unsurprising, Warframe has also struggled with its PVP modes, the pvp community is dead there and we are all glad they are focusing on its PVE content primarily. 
---
It‚Äôs still around?! Its been ages since launch. That‚Äôs crazy. Not too surprised but still.
---
I'll miss you TopicWeDisagreeOnGuyFromReddit. You were a butt but an honest butt.
---
Non-PS4 Pro, digital Tricentennial purchase.
---
I seem to have fewer DCs and blue screens than others?
---
Not sure ... EST, and on ‚Äúrural internet‚Äù. (think: very little ‚ÄòX/mbs‚Äô)
---
While I don't agree that the game is that badly off, I'm still upvoting you for a nice turn of phrase. 
---
Meanwhile I've seen exactly one frog in the entire game. Within minutes of leaving vault 76 my bro killed one and we thought it was hilarious since it looked like a normal frog but with the limbs swapped. Long in front and short in back. 
---
I don't know much about networking, but Fo76 being as buggy as it is, it might as well be sending too many requests to wlan, so it timeouts. 
---
Sneaking around stalking people you see on your map is not my idea of a good time. Sneak could be useful if they fixed the invisible mutation/armor. Altering what could be entertaining random encounters because of sneak players doesn't make sense to me. Most fun ive had with a game is playing Rust and all the random odd ball shit you would run into. Like a bunch of nakeds on the beach cuddled around a fire trying not to die, then you bait a bear over to them and they all scatter. Shit like that.
---
Level scaling. For one it''s not needed if players can't be seen on map. You could do just fine skirting around high traffic areas. Two it's no fun. I like a challenge when enter a fresh world, make plays, progress, get killed what ever your fate. I don't want Bethesda holding my hand.
---
I'm being me at the moment. The issue is they are removing this and giving less options next patch.
---
Why wouldn't they be?
---
I actually noticed today, in the atom shop, if you preview that "wonderful" chandelier they added, youll see its hanging from a wood roof rather than a metal one.
---
Truly wonderful indeed üëç
---
Hell, I just want some inverted corner pieces. And maybe some better stairs. 
---
Yeah I found the ingredients for it to be over the top. I try to rely on Pharma Farmer for it but I've been tuning my builds a bit and those three points, even two points can be better used for other things.
---
playing 8 hours of fallout 76 every single day for months is something you should be ashamed of and probably seeking help for, not something you should be bragging about
---
**Explosive shotguns are not the stick you measure against.**  
---
Furthermore, you are examining every possible choice as if it is the only weapon you can use in all situations. That's the wrong way approach this game. It is objectively false.  
---
You start by opening up with explosive weapons at a group of enemies and do a lot more damage right off of the bat than you can possibly do with any other weapon, switch to rifles as enemies close in or scatter to pick off a few, maybe switch to automatics or melee or unarmed or shotguns for any of the closest range threats.
---
Yep, they got me good. Heard the beeping, looking around frantically for a Super Mutant, then realize the beeping......is coming.... from this Mole Rat that is charging at me!
---
I had never built up my Luck stat in FO before.  This time I filled Luck first, and played around the perks.  
---
What gotta be in the bag junk?
---
Nope, just a battle, in a neverending war.
---
On the newsletter check @fallout on twitter
---
I only see the Modern Chandelier and that one's hanging from a wood roof, mind post a picture of what you're talking about?
---
Just jump on something that it cant get to while wearing a gas mask. Personaly i used the grenade launcher for my first in the trainyard near the whitespring
---
&gt;This is unbelievably entitled
---
So is telling other people they need to quit if they have complaints about or requests for the game. 
---
&gt;Developers **don't share roadmaps**, across all types of content and not just games, because delays happen.
---
(Emphasis mine)
---
That is absolutely false. This is just a small list of games with (shared) public roadmaps:

So developers do share roadmaps.
---
 I do know rather a lot about the network. No a router is hard to overwhelm and just dumps excess crap.
---
  I don't believe Fallout 76 does that anyway, I have seen no evidence of it and watched the network while I was playing for a while to make sure I understood the disconnects. 
---
This is why I want player trading, so I can buy FLUX for my PS mods.
---
Level 50 is the highest level that does anything, after that there is no additional leveling content and they just kinda let you level forever not really getting any stronger 
---
Sorry man. I hope things work out for you.
---
I almost quit. Took two weeks off, and rolled s non-famous Build.
---
Loving it! (only level 18 atm, but another NukesDragons Build I await.)
---
This is my ‚Äúchillout‚Äù character. ;-)
---
I use the steath option with high power snipers and massive amounts of explosives (grenades). I also use beer and all the other booze mixed with the charisma perks to boost the effects of constant drinking. So i shoot from afar till my cover is gone then chuck nuka nades....then whiskey plus psychobuff so i can shrug off attacks when things get up close and personal. 
---
I also can carry a ton of extra junk due to all the carry weight bonuses....
---
Ta da!!! A fun original build that isn't meta. 
---
First encounter with a wentigo I shit my pants, I think I was ~20 something level and it was 40+ I was fighting it and the damage I was doing was very low cause I was kept missing it with how fast and scared got me. Thankfully some higher level guys showed up and helped me finish it.
---
Nowadays I go into wentigo cave every day to say hello to my old nemesis and one shot it before even the epic music starts. 
---
Aren't Vault-Tech one of the companies that joined the shadow government to form the Enclave? 
---
If you're on xbox I can whip you up a few sets, either when I'm off tonight or anytime tomorrow. 
---
Idk man. I play with two guys pretty regularly. I'm a Bloodied unarmed melee build, one is a High Health rifleman, and the other guy is a Low Health Vats Crit Build. All are focused on Max damage and we can each take each other out in PVP depending on the circumstances. Feels pretty balanced to me. The vats Crit build does the most damage out of all of us.
---
Hate when that happens
---
I‚Äôve actually been wondering this too
---
Location on the map? Really nice build man
---
I've been tempted to jump in those so many times just to see what happened. Even with marsupial I never did. Now I know not to lol

---
I usually find at least one around Whitespring. Wendigo can usually be found wandering around with large groups of feral ghouls. I usually steer clear of ghouls for that reason alone.
---
Is there anything this reddit won't complain about?
---
Exactly. I know the bugs were a big issue for many, but they were talking about releasing new content at the end of December, then the end of this month, and now March..
---
This game has been playable with a few bugs since last month, and most of mine seemed to be created when we got a PS4 update.. but I think most of us still playing really want that new content.
---
Bug fixes are great, but I don't think that the focus should still be on fixing bugs at this point, they can release content while they fix bugs.. last month would have been a perfect time to start releasing content- now I have to wait months, which is frustrating as a player from the beta on.

- inverted corner roof pieces
---
- different roof walls inside and out to match the other walls
---
- overhang on the flat roof sections
---
- better stairs
---
- more items to put on shelves
---
- fixes to doors not actually sitting in door ways
---
- clean variation of the current walls (love the barn walls apart from the broken glass)
---
All of these and more... so lots of things I'd like to change lol

Yes, having extensive experience with dozens of online multiplayer video games over a long period of time does give me a lot of data to draw on when I make predictions as to whether some proposed changes will be a good idea or not. That is how experience generally works.

---
Your one size fits all dogma about how to build games is how 16 year olds think about this, not how adults who work in studios do. 
---
Games whose shtick is bling, like CoD, or Rocket a league, yes. That applies. 
---
A game that appeals to a crowd that has never let bugs get in the way of buying these titles, which appeal to several audiences that use and enjoy the game very differently, and when trying to approach these audiences with a new (to them in this game franchise) fusion genre, which is a lot of words to saying when spiking something new with a forgiving client base, bling doesn‚Äôt matter.
---
Building something people would use does. 
---
As for whether design decisions were terrible, that‚Äôs your opinion. 
---
Let‚Äôs see how many copies they sell, because I think this is (once factoring in what the product will become with time - its a product that continues development post launch) - will keep people swiping credit cards, no matter how high your emotions run, 
---
Does this game have millions of players? It sold poorly and had pretty sharp dropoff.  Like this subreddit hasn't grown in members since november, and has been getting less and less posts. People are mostly not playing this game much. 
---

---
This does make sense, but I believe the issue people have is that we're trying to not focus this hard on realism in the game where we can jump 12 feet into the air firing down explosive plasma rifles at a pack of glowing ghouls
---
I already made a mega post about this a while back, Bethesda responded. 
---
I looked around more, they say it's one near the bog, dont know the name 
---
I‚Äôve always thought this too. I‚Äôve also wondered how ‚Äúworth it‚Äù it is to do them after level 50
---
I use the one in bottom right, near Watoga.  People said it was the best.  
---
But loot all seems pretty generic now.  What is the incentive? At L120, the requisitions just give me some exercise.  The only things I don‚Äôt already have would be better legendaries, rare plans, and rare cosmetics.  None of those drop in reqs.
---
What else is there?
---
Maybe I‚Äôm over reacting here but I switched on my Xbox for a little Appalachia excursions therapy and all my armor mods for my x-01 are missing wtf!!! I was at full capacity and now my stash was literally 65 pounds lighter !!!!!and my extra flight pack mods , optimized servos and calibrated shocks are all gone !!!!!wth  Bethesda I thought you guys fixed the glitch  scrapping  mods .!!!!
---
"All Pip-Boys are on the meta-network with location enabled" probably said by unknown RobCo engineer.
---
is that near the bog? I'm trying to find that one people described
---
Upduding
---
Ok so no haven‚Äôt seen or thought of this very nice well done
---
For real. I usually find at least one hanging out with large groups of ferals. I avoid ghouls for this reason alone. I don't feel like getting my face eaten off today.
---
Also, I think this game makes a bunch of excellent design decisions, and I like and enjoy it. 
---
Oh good. 
---
Yeah, I've found all the mats have to be either ON ME or IN STASH, but if split between, won't work.
---
I would really like to get this rifle today, so if you want more than I offered, please let me know.
---
TL;DR: 
---
1) Several actions I take in a blast radius don't work. Hotkeys for stimpacks, and harvesting irradiated plants are the ones I can name off the top of my head. 
---
2) Also, I noticed that many of my shots with sniper rifles in zoom mode miss, even at center mass. 
---
3) And it would be really nice if raw fluxes didn't spoil - I have to harvest 20 raw violet fluxes just to make the +2 STR +2 END BoS lining for the uniforms. It is borderline impossible, especially in Whitespring, to find 20 raw violet fluxes in one go. By the time I acquire 20, at least some of them spoil.
---
I went to my first blast zone today, was very excited. My primary reason was to harvest and make pure violet fluxes for the BoS uniform lining. The only irradiated violet flux plants I could find, the harvest button didn't work. I was only able to collect a few; by the time I collect enough for 2 violet fluxes, more than half of them will spoil, even with the Good With Salt perk. Why in the heck would you make those spoilable?
---
I died 3-4 times because my stimpack hotkey never works. Even when I change it. This only happens in blast zones. 
---
Overall, a very frustrating experience.
---
You can play support pretty effectively if you run in teams, it's just no one likes to play that way it seems. Having a team member in the back with a Medic's weapon and the right perk cards placed in Charisma would be a great build.
---
Maybe because it takes me a second to realize half the map isn‚Äôt level 11?
---
A week of ‚Äòonly thrown weapons,‚Äô would be interesting!
---
I didn't like NV.  So wanted to.  So.  
---
Didn't.  Loved 4.  Love 76.    
---
YMMV
---
I think they just appeared in my Craft Menu options the moment I got the Makeshift Warrior Perk?  No plan that I recall...  
---
Yes please.
---
The sell value sucks ass...got an item worth nearly 200 caps and only get 8 for it, it should be buy for full price and sell for half as making caps is a chore
---
It's beautiful! Although there are forage-ables that are kind of rare, too, like starlight berries and honey. Especially honey. Is there any chance of finding a map of those locations?
---
They should change the splash damage. A direct hit gets 300% current splash then it's damage drops off logarithmically to a hard limit of 10% damage at 30 feet. Or something like that. They need to really up near miss damage and a direct hit even more. 
---
AA and TS are both prefix dude so they can be one or the other fyi. 
---
That said, I *think* that AAE will be the way to go. Though I really want a Furious Exploding minigun 
---
how long are you online tho?
---
You can swap out perks, so everyone can craft.
---
But you are right, everyone is primarily a damage toon.
---
When you get the epiphany, ‚ÄúFFS!‚Äù
---
And roll a QOL character.
---
You become free.
---
/seriously
---
I want more styles and shapes, would see so many new build designs and styles 
---
30-40 mins, but I can wait if it's needed so that you can log in.
---
Or people get grieved even more an quit the game after losing actual gear. The solution this mode needs is just have everyone start fresh.

Look at the first reply - might help you :)
---
I can one shot a lvl 80 scorch beast with a bloodied Fire axe 
---
I don't think the weapons need a buff, other than energy weapons.  
---
I don't really take a lot of care when I play, but I rarely ever die.  I mean almost never.  And I should get my ass kicked more if I'm just half-assing it.
---
Wes-Tek has one almost every time I go. :)
---
I guess the logic for this is if you're travelling with teammates with higher levels than you that are capable of equipping those weapons, you can craft those ammo for them.
---
You know what? This is a perfectly good couch. I‚Äôm taking this couch.

Unless I'm reading it wrong, you link states that subscribers have continued to grow steadily, though slowed down in January.
---
It also says that posting peaked in early December.
---
Is the VTU a Casual Underarmor?  I thought it counted as a Vault-Tec underarmor?
---
I've only ever found the plans for the Flannel Shirt &amp; Jeans by browsing vendors.  I found my Military Fatigues in-game, but no plans for it yet.  I didn't even know there was a Grafton Track Suit.
---
Sadly, a week ago they said that they *are going* to fix it with the next patch. Sorry man.
---
Server stability is top priority. Enough of the fk‚Äôn disconnects, crashes, etc.
---
What was that one subway station in FO4 that you couldn‚Äôt fast travel to without getting sandwiches between 3 of them? Marsden? Started with an M. That place was several seconds of terror the first time I did that.
---
They won't get anything as obsidian didn't make it the workers at obsidian did before they joined obsidian 
---
Have more then it says and make sure it's all in your stash. I've encountered this bug a lot and this fixes it everytime. 
---
You know what would be great? Wallpaper. Applicable to all current walls
---
Why didn't you just fast travel or save and quit the game?
---
Its 3 months and energy weapons are still unusable. Are only the interns left?
---
Helpful hint: stop trying to carry everything that isn't nailed down. There is no limit to resources in the game. The accrual rates are so insanely fast, I routinely carry nothing but my power armor and stins and my super sledge. 10 minutes into any play session and I'm overflowing with junk. 
---
I'm also currently rocking a cave camp, its propper snug and has a acid extractor in it..whenever I fast travel to it I get to farm a scorchbeast too and sometimes it's even fighting a cargobot, so nuke key cards are a plenty.
---
The atmos and lighting in caves is kinda cool with the right lights I just wish it was a little bigger so I can fit a bed in there and some furnishings.
---
It gets a bit eerie when there's the sb circling  outside but the bitch can't get in and can't see me so all my benches and stuff are protected.
---
Cave camps 4 life
---
On the other hand, the flow of loot is ridiculous.  They knew that if we could sell it all for its value, we would have so much money inflation would be overwhelming.  So they put this big valve on the capflow.
---
There was a post on this sub about underarmor and linings and I know jeans and undershirt are real for sure but on the post under casual underarmor it said VTU tracksuit was one of them, can you tell me which vendor specifically you found Flannel Shirt And Jeans Plan? 
---
Someone‚Äôs getting ready to roleplay as the mad bomber for the survival servers
---
I would make Handmade less stable. Then it has a role at high damage but at cost of skill in bringing it back on target. Let Assault Rifle be stable AF, so you can sustain the damage. Combat rifle need something to differentiate it, like... in the middle but at cost of weight? I just want balance and purpose for all weapons and classes and currently we dont have that, not even close...
---
Anything's available if you're brave enough
---
Well said, sir! 
---
I'm completely with you OP. I posted a similar idea weeks ago and was flamed beyond belief. 
---
They seem to miss the point behind game balance, which there is simply none of. When's the last time any of those trolls played anything other then power armor/super sledge build? Want to play sneaky sniper? too bad, because 3/4 of your weight is taken up with only 2 rifles, enough ammo for maybe 3 scorch beasts, and your armor. So i'm forced to take half my points or more for weight reduction perks. So doing this benefits both, but puts them closer together imo.
---
I think that they should be passive skills for so many points into each SPECIAL. Like at 3, 6, 9 points in perception, you get 25% lower rifle weapon weight, etc.
---
It's funny that the same people flaming about rifle weight not being too high say that its because they can hit from range rather than melee. And then say it's more realistic that way. How is sneaking around with a rifle in a post apocalyptic setting NOT exactly what everyone would be doing? You want to run into 5 super mutants with a sledgehammer in real life? Be my guest lol. Fallout is not about realism, it never has been. Which is why i don't understand these idiots nonsensical logic.
---
Those numbers were probably caused by the extreme weight issues. I was about to give up early on before I got the weight perks and set a mule up.
---
They went too far into survival territory. Not even Fo4 was like this.
---
I like this one too. Wish there was more options available. 
---
&gt;	This might also have just been what the area of a blast zone is like after it disappears
---
Exactly.
---
The first is not RNG though, you get all power supply plans eventually from those events. üòú
---
It‚Äôs possible if my character transfers over I just like to blow stuff up!
---
Rekt.
---
That‚Äôs always a nasty surprise when you take a workshop. Find the guy on the map. ‚ÄúI can take a level 18. Oh look he fast trave-oh shit...‚Äù
---
About time they get used 
---
That's a cool idea. I might have to do that.
---
I have a carry weight  max of 200 unbuffed.  My carried gear is 110 lbs.  I use one rank of the food weight reducer.  You're correct that they are not fun, so, I don't use them.  
---
It‚Äôs weird.
---
It‚Äôs beyond gratitude. It‚Äôs like groveling unnecessarily. Just weird.
---
That depends on play style and enemies. I play bloodied and ranged sniper with some support. However some can play bloodied melee. The best effects might be hard to name. The worst is easy, Berserkers.
---
And? This game seemed to have a huge drop off because it's pretty bad.
---
So one if the best could be bloodied?
---
Nice. Now fix most guns from sucking and then make events not all suck. Also some new end game bosses.
---
Yes they do. Ironically I got them from a Req drop.
---
Hahaha seriously I see so many level 12 players in cranberry bog and fisher prime and get so confused 
---
And they released the game from Beta at the end of 201&amp; smh
---
Well, the core concepts actually feel very solid, physical, presence based to me. Somehow they accomplished that while also having instant fast travel rather than slow flight / taxi between locations. The experience of fighting, gathering, building, wandering in the game is extremely similar to the feeling of all my favorite games that have somewhat open environments. It‚Äôs like an analog concept fed thru a digital series of systems allowing us to convene and do so cooperatively or at least tangentially interactively (players choices affect the other players experience)
---
The plans? o.O
---
What was the response?
---
We ARE only 2 months post launch. I mean, it‚Äôs probably safe to assume that 75% of the player base hasn‚Äôt even really REACHED the end game, let alone been bored by it. I agree that they need MORE end game content, I am not refuting that. Farming nuke sites can only be fun for so long, but I think this post falls under the ‚ÄòI‚Äôm tired of Bethesda not catering to ME‚Äô category. I know a few thousand players share your sentiment, but I think most of us can agree that more of the base game needs to be fixed before adding more to it, Survival Mode included.
---
my first Windigo take down was at The Vantage. I lured him towards the structure (they have trouble with stairs sometimes) and used pretty much all my ammo.
---
It‚Äôs already all broken down 
---
Yeah, the pendulums seems to swing pretty far in different directions when it comes to different aspects.  I seems clear to me that expectations were not clearly communicated anywhere along the chain of command of development.
---
They just said the passed it to the dev team
---
I‚Äôll try it out
---
right.
---
How long ago was this?
---
22 days. I just checked
---
Can you send me his Reddit profile?
---
What???
---
Yes, sw of watoga, close to the bottom of the map
---
Lol I thought they only took payment in the form of souls.
---
So I heard there's a new far cry coming out soon, is that one gonna have all that stuff too? I'm definitely gonna have to start somewhere and check that franchise out. 
---
True, that and how the servers are unstable but I usually claim it as a supplement to the bullets I lost. I see small numbers that add up over time. 
---
k. If people aren't finishing the game "because it's pretty bad", putting priority effort into "more end game content for PvE server"s would be a colossal waste of time for Bethesda.
---
I'd love the have a barn with a dirt floor, so I can have my brahmin and crops indoors. 
---
Bloodied and instigating are 2 of the best right now from what I understand. 
---
No, please, no.
---
Hopefully they'll add that into the next patch for PS4.
---
I feel like this isn't top priority, just like the duplicate perk card issue.
---
Ranged currently is tse with reduced weight. Bloodied/ Anti-armour will probs take pver after nerf. Melee wise you want bloodied 40% fast swing speed with 90% reduced weight or something similar 
---
If your on PS4 I‚Äôll take them
---
Wait from that gfaqs link.... Tomohawks and Knives scale with demolition expert!? Wtf
---
2. Scorch queen decided to fly miles west and disappear into the ground. Like, well out of the event area. She was legit gone and trying to sonar spam us from there. We could see the spam, but it didnt matter. 
---
Nah. They don't.
---
Thx, I have not really read up all that much on the legendary system.
---
The only tier-1 universal mod I can think of is bloodied.
---
Some just want to watch the world burn.
---
"Stop. Thats 'illeagle'."
---
I'd say instigating kinda sucks for ranged.
---
I just bought a pump action TSE reduced weight shotgun from the Whitesprings vendor for 179 caps.
---
Lucky me :) 
---
Since beta we have an event that eats peoples gear, mods getting scrapped in your stash, guns that consume all your ammo when being shot once, and items that aren't affected by the perks that are specifically for that type of item, and that's just what I can remember atm. Three months in and these are *still not fixed!*
---
I love it when a diseased weindigo gives me a disease by shouting at me.
---
It seems like people roll characters to impress other players, versus themselves and the environment.
---
I‚Äôm playing a second character like I would a single player Fallout ... and this is LIBERATING.
---
It is disappointing. I guess fixing it wouldn't be in the top priority with Bethesda but still..really miss hearing real music at my base.
---

Lots of people have requested camp displays for bobbles &amp; armor &amp; weapons, but for now they just sit in a box.  Someday....

Oh yes I don‚Äôt even have grenadier yet I‚Äôm going to kill myself so much but it will be worth it to see the huge mini nuke explosions

Shoot them out of stealth, let their health refill then kill them

It had the prime receiver I'm assuming the person that ho sold didn't know he can change receivers. 
---
While your damage can be maxed at level 50, players who are in the triple digits have access to more perks and legendary items so they *are* probably stronger. 
---
You get random leveled things
---
Yup. Got them a long time ago.
---
Jesus Christ on a bike your lucky nice find man
---
Yeah, sometimes I want to turn off my Pip-Boy radio, but the ambient music in my camp is a little repetitive.
---
&gt;new PvP content
---
just leave this out for a while, PvE is the strongest population
---
How much you paying for them?
---
Huh. What system are you on?
---
I honestly think it's about the same. I still crash consistently on nukes but I do enjoy the game. 
---
Screaming is essential to killing all nasty beasties.  Well done.
---
What counts as rushing? I've played 160 hours since release, level 72, theres nothing to do. I log in, see what the atom challanges are, do them if they're not awful and log out. 
---
Yesterday I was so bored I made two sets of armour and dropped them off to some level 2's. 
---
I wanna play right now but all the vendors are out of caps and I'm full. At least I got the grounded mutation today.
---
Sorry to focus on a side comment you made but: bugged shotgun pellet damage?
---
I'm starting to think that "the dev team" is a nickname for a filing cabinet in the basement behind the boiler.
---
Because Bethesda release.

Really I've played since release and have yet to see one. I have been blown up by moles strapped with mines several times though =\
---
Level means nothing in terms of play time. I farmed at Whitespings for the first time and gained 13 levels. Usually I don't even level once a day on a couple hour session.
---
Computer. 
---
2 caps a rocket and 5 for mini nukes or you can trade them for other ammo
---
Because that‚Äôs what a quitter would do.
---
Yep. BOS heavy combat armor. BOS heavy armor mod can‚Äôt be normally found, so you need to buy the plans, they‚Äôre found at grafton station from the vendor there. He‚Äôs to the north. You can find heavy combat armor almost anywhere in the late game, but notably the monster mash at watoga high school, or the whitesprings resort, with the vendor who has a bear rug, just enter the building and go down the stairs and turn right.
---
Nope. I try to play it about once a week but last 30 mins max. Complete waste of time and money.
---
Full set of lather would boost ability while clmbat armour would set endurance for example? Other RPGs have some buff like this. It's ok, but really makes one set of something more viable then others for specific builds, witch can be quite restrictive in my experience. And costumes should remain what they are rn, purely cosmetic.
---
No one is bragging. It‚Äôs like every post you add something that I supposedly said but didn‚Äôt. Typically troll doing troll things
---
I really enjoy this. Didnt evem have to read through them all to say that all of your implementations are really on point. Would really add to what were already suppose to be doing. Role play üëç
---
Wtf??!!? I've put in so many hours in this game and haven't seen a mutant or a molerat... F
---
I did fast travel back. And the bag was gone lol. I purposely went in. And was like that's tuff.
---
Just because it was a three star legendary enemy does not mean that it was a three star weapon.
---
It's already on the "[bethesda please](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/bethesdaplz)" wish list.

Solved never mind. Didn‚Äôt realize it was torso only 
---
Neat! 
---
Thanks for the positive feedback friend üòä
---
Awesome feedback friend üëç
---
I whole heartedly agree. One of the few things Destiny did right.
---
Oh no not you I meant the other guy. Instead of killing yourself to unstuck, just fast travel or save and reload.
---
There are several level 50 perks that require a few levels to level fully, but you get no more stat points or perk slots, so you don't really get any stronger after level ~60 or so, and legendaries are not guaranteed or delivered on any schedule so you can be lever 49 and have all the best in the game or level 5000 and not ever have found one. It's all luck, the progression in this game is not well designed. 
---
Correction: That's how it works in this game specifically and not any other. Or if you need me to say it another way, it's fucking stupid.
---
I was walking along and zoned out for a second and fell into one of the unmarked fissures.
---
Ever wear a giant metal glove and try to operate the valves on a tuba? Yeah me either, but I'm willing to give it a shot if you are. 
---
Have more that what is required, Everytime I run into this issue it's like I need two steel to fix but all I have is two steel it won't let me do it. Get a few more that what's required and that usually fixes the issue.
---
We must be allowed to toast marshmallows in Nuclear Fire.
---
That sounds hardly worth it. With how god awful the good loot chances are for Scorchbeasts, I can only imagine the chances for supply drops being 100x worse
---
I am TomTheBard. So I made my build around that. Musical instruments melee, drugs, and wandering
---
I actually use FO4 to test out builds for FO76, using mods of course to get the equipment
---
I don't actually think they're necessary, I haven't used a single one of them. 
---
I get people like to carry a lot of stuff, but I really don't agree with all the "there's too much inventory management" comments. 
---
Not for me. Unless you can do it solo
---
It would be neat to get more details.  Maybe this is with respect to only specific things like melee damage, carry capacity, ap, and/or hp?
---
I recall a contrary study in the sense that it talked about the differences between (something like) 31 luck vs 34 luck vs 37 luck in terms of whether you *could* or *will* get maximum durability on found items.
---
Not for me. I'm using a hybrid melee and stealth sniper build w vats crits. My 1 star Instigating lever action does some serious damage.
---
It would probably suck if you weren't using sneak attacks and crits for sure though. 
---
Yeah, hardly worth it now. I used to collect them for low levels, but I am the low level now
---
The TSE weapons can easily be countered. If you keep your level, we damn well better be able to keep our hard earned gear. (If you think just leveling up is a daunting task, try grinding for BiS gear, to be told you can't use it, when all you wanted was pvp the WHOLE time.) My gear, and LEGIT dropped Two shot explosive lever action, were hard earned, with alot, and I mean alot of grinding. Why should people like me be punished and have our time taken away from us? 
---
Careful though if you put something down he does t have the plan for and that item gets stored he won't be able to place it. Friend set me down a fusion gen and a PA stand and I moved locations and could not place them.until I got the plans myself.
---
Ugh....they fibally got back to me after getting this issue to their ‚ÄòAdvanced team‚Äô and reiterated that they can‚Äôt do shit.
---
When do I start suing? I am serious, I refuse this bullshit, their game falsely linked an account that‚Äôs not mine, they have to fix it.

Picture this: Bethesda has just released survival mode. You excitedly scramble to your console/computer to play this new game mode. You press "Play", then select the "Survival" option as opposed to the "Adventure" one.  As the loading screen comes and fades, the anticipation grows. You message your friends to come on through Discord. Suddenly, you realize a player is near. But OH NO!!! They have a duplicated two-shot explosive weapon and kill you in one hit. After several failed attempts to retrieve your junk and aid items you dropped, you feel defeated. You return to the main menu and press play, only this time to select adventure. 
---
Literally unplayable
---
Its because damage output is what ends fights.  There's no peaceful resolution to anything so if you want a reward, you better be ready to spill some blood.  You can build to be tanky as hell but you'll still take some damage that will have to be dealt with via stimpaks.  A medic build sounds nice but they didn't make the system very forgiving as most situations that would warrant a medic like the SBQ fight generally result in players being killed outright instead of being downed and given how death is mostly an inconvenience, most people would rather just have another damage dealer on the board.  Tanking as most RPG players know it isn't really possible thanks to the lack of a threat system.  Enemies are gonna go after the closest thing until its dead, then go for the next closest thing.  
---
tl;dr Lost of people make "fun" builds but speccing for damage and carry weight is gonna outperform them by a wide margin.
---
I'll take them if you are on PC!
---
I'd be down for that...   
---
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **4th Cakeday** StormyLlewellyn1! ^(hug)

3/15=0.2. So from that you can probably say at least 20% will use the PVP server. 
---
Xbox
---
I almost posted about this, then I see you already did. This is a buggy ass game.
---
It's very conditional, since instigating wouldn't work 99.9999% of time during Queen fight or during upcoming PvP mode where no one would ever run with full hp.
---
Bugged for me too.
---
First attempt at starting a game and it disconnected in the loading screen. Random disconnects and crashes in 3  hours. 5 total.
---
On a proper build, making use of Adrenal reaction, Bloodied is a but more damage than two shot. I forget the exact numbers, but if you are sniping or can avoid being hit any, there is no reason to not go bloodied. Bloodied+explosive for most ranged. Bloodied/Instigating+ swing speed and power attack damage for melee
---
But by all means, sure feel free to downvote my experiences with this absolute piece of shit game.
---
It's the same virtually, I only play cuz burned out of other games ATM and have 2 much free time
---
My first character is team support, friendly fire, team medic, rad sponge/goulish, can't recall nameof one that feed the team when I eat. Unfortunately I rarely have teams. Few medics weapons as well, and traveling pharmacy and Tru hiker to carry all the meds and food.
---
Idc how it works. I've done the events 4 times and I know there is people grinding for it and still haven;t gotten it  so I'm just happy I'm having better luck now lol
---
The worst for me was while following the railroad path thing and it leads you past that church. Rounded the corner to like 6 supermutants, my first encounter with them ever, and didn't even know what a suicider was.
---
I learned very quickly.
---
I still awaken in a cold sweat some nights.....
---
Maybe it's 20 unique people.
---
Yeah. Pretty much besides the stealth way it's bad.
---
But it's pretty awesome using it from stealth. Besides that though I can't argue w you.
---
Ok thanx man we r basically the same lvl and have most of the same stuff. Good to know that so it dont get stuck in storage
---
T'was indeed. I'm quite happy with the results from today lol
---
Probably should fix all the base problems while making PVE content.
---
What's the percentage of people that have gotten to level 50? 
---
Im over encumbered so no thanks. Those bikes are six pounds a piece and it‚Äôs hard to say no.
---
Its more dependent on the weapon that has it. A high damage low rate of fire weapon like the dragon for instance, is doing more with instigating than with two shot. After the nerf, instigating will definitely be better on some weapons than two shot
---
You mean to tell me that a dev making their first endeavor into multiplayer has bugs? Shocking. People getting banned for modding an online only game when there has been no confirmation of whether that was approved or not? Dev room debacle? How is that a debacle? Like this is the first game to ever have dev items get into the game. World of Warcraft says hi. Game isn't $10. Again, you are literally making things up, have not a single  grain of evidence for anything you've stated (leaked server sizes? K). This level of bitterness towards a game is just pathetic. Go be toxic and bring down whatever game community you actually play. Normal people who are capable of enjoying a game, while still acknowledging its flaws, hang out here. 
---
RIP white springs
---
Shotguns do far more than listed damage as the explosive dmg is much higher per pellet. Its weird.
---
Ugh so much of this game is hardly worth doing. I hate it. I so badly want to like this game.
---
When all of the vendors are out of caps because of all the other legendaries you've sold them already. 
---
Can I at least copy and paste the description so I don't have to re write it?
---
Or the more likely result, release it as DLC
---
Moving the goal posts. You're really bad at this. 
---
Would actually be something worth spending atoms on
---
Plus, if you know your going pvp, just chug something with a little rads. Not worth possibly taking instigating damage. Most people will know, and instinctively do this.
---
I totally agree. Griefing is out of control and the community just sides with the griefers. We should be calling them out. They make the game no fun. No one wants to just get attacked for hours every time they log on.
---
You're just...stupid fucking lucky man. That's it. This game is still chock-full of bugs. 
---
Or they never played their own game long enough to see it.
---
I know I gave up long before I got there.
---
Ok I‚Äôll be on again in the morning have a bunch of .45 basically no 2mm
---
It can't be an overlooked qol feature when every fifth post is asking for it. 
---
Hopefully it will be a life.
---
I‚Äôm just biding my time until my friend fixes his computer. Until then, I‚Äôm content with Fallout: Sims
---
Agreed 100%
---
I‚Äôve had them spawn at the back gate near the Whitesprings service entrance. 
---
Faster fire rate is better than reduced weight. We need to be min/maxing here, not toting extra junk around.
---
Oh no problem at all. I was putting a ton of time into the game and wanted to give back to the community. At the end of the day, these stats don't really matter enough once you get 3 star legendaries.
---
Its possible, if you watch that thing long enough the tentacles move, so it isnt dead
---
Maybe you tried, but in case you didnt, hit play again asap when you disconnect. I have managed to rejoin the same server on a few occasions, sure it's not likely but it doesnt hurt to try. 
---
Exactly
---
One of those "base problems" is that slap-to-duel PvP is pretty bad and nobody does it.
---
Yup and Im not even really complaining about the pvp. I get it. It happens. And its usually fun. But when you get a bored group of super high levels just doing nothing but nuke zone then waiting and travelling to peoples camps. 
---
It gets old really fast.
---
Love the game despite all of the bugs/shutdowns/server issues. I can deal with that.
---
But when almost every server you get on has someone with a fatman and endless ammo just nuking your camp cause they saw you on the map with a friends way away from anything else and they ran there...just to be a dick basically. And there is no fighting back. They one shot you if you happen to avoid being killed by a spray of nukes.
---
This happens a lot in multiplayer open-world games. Some people will just not accept criticism towards a game's lack of end-game content because that obviously means you rushed through the game without caring about the content, and you haven't spent the countless hours necessary to do filler content (i.e exploration, misc objectives, etc). 
---
Lmao....no....no it's not. 
---
Maybe they should add more content for the people who are already bored. It's not high level players fault there is no end-game content other than SB queens. That's why I don't play anymore (other than bugs).
---
One of the sky mansions has a nice looking minigun in a cage, down side though it's unique paint job disappears when you pick it up =[
---
Thats what i was refering to haha My bad, i was just being a smartass because they add all this "elegant" shit to place in our camps when the only asset at the moment thats somewhat "classy" looking is brick. And i doubt that perfectly clean shiny chandelier doesnt look all that natural with those dingy walls. But, the preview of it showed wood ceilings, so at least something about it got me excited haha
---
Brick brick, make it stick, lay em down, now you've got the brick!
---
Fair point
---
They're in game. 
---
Also, mole rat landminers made a return too. 
---
I get what you are saying and I agree that it adds a shade of logic too it... but it is probably best to not start pulling too hard on the threads of this one. I'm carrying 2k bullets and they weight 10 pounds :p
---
Lol, don't spend atomic points on it. I got it and the lighting is all buggy
---
Isn't very bright either...
---
There's a mod for that
---
It's a cap sink. The vendors will keep a large amount of the caps, they don't immediately have the same amount available to barter. 
---
It works like that in FO4 
---
Sshhhhhh..... logic doesn't exist in West Virginia
---
And the BoS turn in quests say to turn in "Techncial" data, who cares Spelling mistakes are really the least of our concerns with this game. 
---
Month ago I seen a level 1600 legit or not I don‚Äôt know but just saying 1000 been hit awhile ago üòÇ
---
Yes, but, once again, who needs high damage when you cannot deal it at Queen or during pvp?
---
Problem is, 90% of the other guns are shit.
---
And what will happen to the next best thing that everyone will use? You guessed it, more nerfs. 
---
If you want to be competitive damage wise, its either melee or pre nerf TSE rifles or heavys. Throw that weight reducing shit out of here, you see? You only need one weapon, maybe two, and the armor on your back. Maximizing damage means not giving a shit about carry weight!
---
Idk. The pvp is a bit messed up. Pacifist mode should protect people better based on level gap. Its shitty when I high level runs up to you and just obliterates you. I'm level 16 (i work a lot and only get to play a couple hours a week) and i have been hunted down numerous times by high level players for bo reason.
---
I'm with the Guild
---
No, it doesn't. Try it.
---
Commie alert, get out of this sub 
---
Yeah true that. I have a recording where my game crashed from trying to pick up a can of dog food 
---
I agree. There needs to be more content for higher levels. 
---
But I guess that doesn't mean be a dick so everyone else stop playing because they can't keep up due to other obligations.
---
But ya. I hear ya.
---
Yes. There's a pretty big limit on vendor caps, plus don't get me started on the whole gd vEnDoR aLlIaNcEs thing. Makes it difficult to sell all the loot.
---
- OP who Posted - Thank u for doing things u should have already done.
---
- Bethesda - Awe thanks - we aren‚Äôt trying very hard but appreciate nothing
---
- People Who Still Oddly Play - I‚Äôm level 3,000 and still play because it‚Äôs fun to be 2,940 levels above where they expected - obvious because the map doesn‚Äôt even display triple digits.  thanks to duping and hacks
---
- Bethesda - Well aren‚Äôt you a hoot - we don‚Äôt like that u are level 3,000 and clearly know u cheat but we aren‚Äôt going to ban you because we don‚Äôt care and we have no backbone
---
- Me - it‚Äôs obvious some people cheat - you can‚Äôt have 100+ 2-Hit- explosive weapons playing legit or have 100k weight from legit collecting - ban these rejects - but what do I care - I‚Äôm back play RDR2 since 3 weeks ago
---
- Bethesda - We can‚Äôt ban them or they won‚Äôt buy all the expensive DLC‚Äôs that should have been part of the original game to fix bugs but we didn‚Äôt give a **** and are charging u for that
---
- Reddit - i think they should allow people to have 50 more weight limit and I‚Äôm gonna post that every day like that‚Äôs the only issue
---
- Me - I just spent 3 hours clearing a silo and disconnected when my nike dropped literally wasting all my free time today when I expected to farm my own drop - who even gives a **** anymore - I sold my used copy for $2 at GameStop - how do I unsubscribe from this sub
---
I ran a maxed agility/luck pistols VATS crit build, it was fantastic. Never used explosive, two shot or TSE weapons. Anti-armor or furious is better anyway. 
---
Lately I've been wondering how much the arbitrariness of weapon weights has something to do with balancing VATS costs. If AP costs and general speed with which you can handle your weapon is still tied to weapon weight like it was in Fo4 (which seems a safe assumption) then the fact a fully modded rifle weighs so much might have to with the devs trying to increase its AP cost for VATS ü§î kind of a bass-ackwards way to do it, but I've been wondering if that's part of the reasoning behind it. Especially when it comes to the weight of weapon mods.
---
Make your brick house nearby mothman museum, maybe grahm will stop by today
---
Check your email, not sure if that is the banned error or not but it could be if you arent able to log in at all
---
Indeed üëç  I really like this idea. Right now Im carrying two different Western Revolvers, and i can tell you youd never catch me dressed as a cowboy haha that is, unless they added some sort of benefit as you suggested. 
---
Chap me up, baby! üòâ
---
I have.
---
Yeah I'm not condoning it, but if I like a game I want to play it, and if pvp is a mechanic you can be sure people will use it.
---
Also after playing 8 hours a day every single day you are spending some of your other time to be on reddit to post about the game? Jesus christ dude. 
---
Oh F\*\*\*.
---
And crappy events, overkill on the survival mechanics (weight, durability), horrible UI (PC), crashing, disconnects, bad loot, poor balance (lol next patch is worse), practically no end game, etc.
---
One time I killed a normal super mutant, not even legendary, and he dropped me a Two shit explosive shitgun and a full set of unyielding sentinel marine armor!
---
Yeah the best ones are they have a lower level friend or alt. 
---
That does nothing but run around and attack. Then the instant you fight back. You get one shot by a high level.
---
Im not talking about the difference between an 80 and a 90 fighting. Its the 3+ 295 or 200lvls just waiting for you to go red. Ok...kill me for the 10 caps I just got on me. Oooook.
---
I aim for that sweet &amp; juicy booty hole
---
Damn, I haven't seen that, either.
---
Nope just checked my email I'm not banned 
---
Lol üòÜ I like the Western and chaps, red bandana, patrolman glasses and the cowboy hat in the atomic shop, plus I like to use the lever action so it works out for myself already actually
---
Oh yeah, happens all the time. That or I'll click them and nothing happens, then a minute later "9 tin cans added."
---
I'd have to agree. Are bugs still a thing? Hell yeah.
---
Am I or anyone I actually know that plays 76 taking what seems to be HOURS to get a good play session in, suffering from frequent problems and other problems seemingly endlessly? A few crashes and dumb stuff here and there but for the most part, no. It's been pretty damn easy getting a good lasting session going. 
---
Another red flag about this overreaction I noticed is that every time a patch drops, people left and right are swearing to their mom the game's either become 'MUCH more stable' or 'nearly unplayable'. Yeah I barely notice shit myself tbh. 
---
In short, Beth, your game's still for sure riddled with bugs and problems but I'm really starting to get the feeling a lot of the complaints are overinflated.
---
Usually they run up to me and start smacking me with the mini nuke
---
Check again.
---
Do the same thing with Rifle and do 3-4x more dps. 
---
These two instances from FO4 I remember well.
---
Do you still have table lamps?
---
Why don't you?
---
Sorry! Forgot to specify i‚Äôm on ps4 :(
---
Because I am literally playing fallout 4 right now.
---
Np
---
Me either.  I feel cheated!! :D
---
Did you ever figure this out? I'm curious myself :)
---
Oh I got a sloth in the swamp just the other day. I didn't even know what it was when I started shooting lol
---
You get progressively larger generators as you do the events
---
And if you're playing it, why don't you check?
---
I do not fancy meeting those.
---
I had somethibg similar happen to me at Harpers, about a dozen legendaries spread between the vendor and the church and the outside road lane. 
---
Someone said that each server draws from a small pool of possible legendary affixes and suffix, so a server that dropped 1 two shot is likely to drop you another two shot. Anecedotally, on mu legendsry spree I got 6 anti armor weapons. 
---
There's vultures lurking about.
---
Seriously.. :3
---
"Not I," said the goat.
---
I see your point, sir.
---
Get back under your bridge.
---
No thank you.
---
You expect bethesda to give up a multimillion dollar franchise? Even to sell it would be stupid, it's an incredibly lucrative franchise. 
---
It's not happening. 
---
It could even be as simple as a camp item like the siren, radio tower of fo4, or the sonic scorchbeast thing that attracts them, build it in camp, turn it on and  it starts a mission that sends in wave after wave of whatever the local beast is to you until you turn it off, or even simpler, until it‚Äôs not powered anymore and the quest limits itself. 
---
Tse Lever action and 25k caps
---
Well, I tried changing the priority to "high," and I'll be damned, but the game runs much smoother. There is still a little bit of stuttering, but much less. 
---
I gotta disagree. Griefing isn't the problem in this game that I expected. When it does very rarely occur, it's pretty simple just to server hop and dodge the bullet. Mostly high level players I've come across have either ignored me or given me cool shit. Overall it feels like a pretty pro-social community.
---
I have a AA explosive single revolver I'm not sure how the AA effect interacts with the explosion because I have a tse single revolver that is more effective 
---
Well at least I know now you're not an idiot...
---
Theres a fuck ton of creatures that hardly ever spawn its stupid
---
We shouldn‚Äôt be able to see each other on the map, except teammates. 
---
Well, my roommate thinks I am...
---
Mmm, between last month and this month theres very few people who nuke whitesprings. Right now people are bombing thqueen 99% of the time and ebough people have tse and bloodies that thr queen falls in 2 minutes or less. So right now you cam grind out like a dozen queens per day. 
---
Oh i would never haha Those items dont really appeal to me. Only light i enjoy is the fish lamp, and i still havent gotten it. Im into RR and Nuka stuff, and im just waiting for some better paint schemes.
---
Side note: can you believe, after all our bitching, theyre still adding paint schemes for single armor sets?? And what, because its "limited" its more expensive than the ones that are permanently available?? Id rather pay 1200 on a simple paint pallet that can be applied to everything (or even just armor OR weapons, but alllll of either), not this one type of shitty paint, for one type of armor, or one hardly used weapon. 
---
Fucking 900 points to pretend like Uncle Sam actually fights his own battles.. Pfft
---
I think they should‚Äôve tested this before the game was released.
---
And I have a full time job and can only play weekends.  YMMV.  You don't like it, fine.  
---
See you when you get back.
---
Ok, and? Not everyone is focused on "must do max possible damage". Some of us just want a build that is fun to play. I think there are plenty of those. 
---
If you summon then and shoot em down before they start to drop their cargo, you can find Nuclear Keycards in the dropped crates. Easiest way to farm Keycards for launching nukes. So they do have some merit later on, you just gotta shoot em down instead of letting em drop their cargo normally üëçthe crate will look upside down and be locked (level 0 lock), and that's when you know you've done it right for there to be a chance at a Keycard.
---
More like melee buttfucking
---
Don't take my word for it, they would have a better idea.
---
Haha were talking on two different posts about the same thing üòÇüòÇ
---
I'm hoping that it's in some way tied into the dunwich lore and we see it played on in later updates. 
---
I'm with you, fellow Vault Dweller.
---
Set camp on outside unless you got a sick fortress 
---
Happened to me with a 3star anti-armor handmade a while back. Ik that feel
---
I love my fish lamp lol
---
And right? As if Bethesda hasn't screwed us enough that they want to start pinching pennies in the atomic shop? I mean c'mon man
---
I've only seen one cluster of them in 200+ hours, I think they may have been a random event. 
---
And it's going to be even way weaker next patch. I was using this already weaker build. But it's just going to get worse.
---
He thinks that if I JOKINGLY stab him in the leg while watching Netflix, that I'm automatically some psychopath, which I am not btw!
---
read: "im desperately trying to pretend age equals authority"
---
I can make all your problems with the guards go away. But it'll cost you. What do you say?
---
My build is going to be gutted. And so will I. This is heartbreaking.
---
 I reply to too many comments to keep track of names lol
---
It's probably because they screwed up the leveling XP curve, and didn't expect people to get that high level so quickly.  By the time they noticed, people were already reaching 80+ and it was too late.  
---
World of Warcraft when it first came out in 2004 was smart enough to recognize this problem.  They made it SO hard to level up that it wasn't possible to get that high level.  Their patches over the first several years were to make the game easier to level.
---
Yes, clear my bounty.
---
How exactly is it going to be weaker if they're not nerfing anything in it?? They're nerfing explosive and TS. 
---
Even better, no weapons or armor drop, everything crafted, real survival not this bs they trying to call PVP.
---
Wow what a quick judgement to make, maybe you should patch up the wound with some salt and vinegar, show him that you really care.
---
Never underestimate how high I can get! #sourdiesel 
---
I think most of us here will never forget the first time we saw a wendigo in FO76. When your open world exploration suddenly becomes a horror chaser
---
Noob.
---
A thin line my friend.  A very thin line.
---
Well last few days its been prolific. And yeah you can say "server hop". But any workshop you built up. GONE.
---
So you are cutting a somewhat decent portion of the game out if you constant server hop because you end up on one where the high level bored griefing comes into play.
---
So I quickly got these 3 pieces been trying this in PVE, it never works as you described. What slots were your pieces in and what armor type?
---
I have been compromised
---
Best of luck to you, hope you get sorted.
---
Chalking up the game running fine to luck is prone to the exact opposite. You can argue the people crashing for hours are just really stupid fucking unlucky.
---
Because I really think they're just really fucking unlucky tbh.
---
Why the fuck would I do that? The bathrooms across the hall. If he wants that wound patched up so badly, why doesn't he do that him fucking self? 
---
Glad it helped! This game is surprisingly cpu heavy. See you in Appalachia!
---
Disconnections keeep happening here on PC on me &amp; many other players i play with still, but individually at least.
---
Hopefully this update comes with that. 
---
Resetting the router helps tho. 
---
It gives you all the generators you mustve done it like 5 or 6 times before. Its not rng.
---
Since you've missed the point I'll bold it too.
---
*WHATEVER YOU SAID DOES NOT MAKE IT NOT A SHITTY GAME MECHANIC*
---
Its awful when he walks up stairs towards you. My fiance walked in an made a noise of disgust at the screen, walked right back out.
---
Haha i like the weapons üëç just not normally a chap man üòÇ But i would be more inclined to wear obscure things i normally wouldnt to enjoy the Roleplay and benefits of such. 
---
Is there a cowboy hat available in game at all, or only atom shop? Because then it wouldnt necessarily work as they CANNOT make any atom shop item any more beneficial to have in game.
---
Yeah fair point, maybe you should call a swat team in to help him out or something?
---
Yeah, I'm lucky my build will still be good, but seriously. Cmon people. This is Fallout not CoD. Two shot explosive was supposed to be exactly how it is. People exploiting, then people complaining about it, caused the nerf.
---
I mean, I could've, but how would I call the cops on discord?
---
I'm an unarmed build. I just run around in a hazmat suit and generally do just fine. With the right mutations and perk cards you still have decent defense and attack. 
---
I've tried a rifle build, a pa build, and this..and this is by far the most fun
---

---
Yikes
---
How about a floor that actually works?
---
Like why must this floor sets be conected to stairs? Why can't they be next to or hangong from foundations?
---
Pistol DPS is trash and is currently being carried by **TSE** \+  Sneak/Crit. 
---
Idk man people are chomping at the bit for more content while complaining about everything being broke, I feel like Bethesda is really stick between a rock and a hard place with the whole thing. They most definantly put themselves in this situation, but I feel like we need the extra content to hold us over until we get some dlcs and vaults. 
---
Just start googling terrorist stuff I guess I'm sure you'll get a knock soon.
---
Yeah I wouldn't want them to make you buy atomic shop items to make that work. There is a spawn for 2  black cowboy hats north of 76 at a Mad Hatter Easter egg table
---
Had to fight my first one in the wendigo cave. Surprisingly two plasma grenades killed it quick. I threw 10 of course. 
---
ok deal if egorklenov dont offer more, ign is mbajestic
---
Mine too, seems op is salty at their lack of luck or ability. Also, prepare to be called a liar and a duper by these morons. :/
---
Some people are hardcore and some people are casual. Casual will spend an hour here and there and be lucky and think oh everything is fine. Hardcore will play like 20 hours a day and find every bug in the game multiple times.
---
Honestly that mask does it More to me.  My brother walked into a room, found it, put it on, and walked out.
---
When I saw him I screamed all kinds of profanity and opened fire m.
---
Inconceivable. I refuse to believe 
---
But I already have... Just last week I was trying to find out how to make a bomb out of a rice cooker!
---
Its called a stealth boy.  Use it.
---
I consider the workshop mechanic the one real directly PVP portion of the game. If you're capturing workshops, I feel like you forfeit your right to complain about being attacked.
---
I learned early on in ARK that PVP is worthless unless you can put 40+hrs into the game per week. The average player is just fodder. Stick to PVE and co-op.
---
Some people did not receive an email accompanying the ban
---
Inconceivable. I refuse to believe. 
---
Rookie mistake it needs to be an alarm clock.
---
I think most of the items are kind of like a joke of sorts, at least I hope no one thought it was something we would truly want. 
---
Ah, that makes sense...
---
Yeah it's super rare and I had the caps. Beat the "game" so I had nothing left to spend them on.
---
Yeah its bad on xbox too. Honestly idk if anyone at bethesda reboots their servers on a reg basis. Because at least on xbox it seems to be fine for a day or two, tues-weds, but then gets progressively worse for the rest of the week....totally anecdotal, but its a pattern ive personally noticed.
---
After many hours of grinding I got it! A full set of excavator!
---
I could see that, but it seems strange that they wouldn't just make each mod when detached also just weigh more.  It could be trying to keep consistency with the other mods, but the design philosophy just seems inconsistent.
---
I'm a thane.
---
i got a full set of excavator! i did the entire questline and farmed all the mats!
---
Really....you should not say thank you for this. I've been playing this game since day 1 and have put up with a lot of shit, but now that Resident Evil 2 and Kingdom Hearts 3 are coming out, I may not even play the game again. The damned blue screens and lack of content is just...sad. 
---
I remember the first time I saw I chicken.
---
I spent like ten minutes following it around so I could get a picture to show my other friends who play.
---
Then I killed it and ate it.
---
Crappy events? Which ones? I've done a few that were really good.  
---
Overkill on Survival mechanics? The survival mechanics are way easier than FO4 survival mode and resources are incredibly abundant. I think I have 30 cans of completely nonperishable dog food in my stash alone.  
---
Horrible UI? How so?  
---
Crashing and Disconnects? Not my problem. I have had a handful of disconnects, but no more than any other online game I've ever played.  
---
Bad loot? LoL Whatever the fuck that means.
---
Poor balance? Balance is for games with classes. If you made a bad choice in building your character, that's on you. They gave you the ability to respec so you don't even need to start over.
---
Practically no end game? You know what I do when I end a game? I stop playing it.
---
I hopped on that exp train of whitespring once i heard future nerfs.
---
Good catch. 
---
And have everyone who put the time grinding, (and the real grind is for armor and weapons, not levels) quit because they feel cheated from the start. Because casual gamers cannot keep up with those who dedicate more time than them? So these people will be forced to start over, and the complaining will slowly creep back as the dedicated players, who will get better returns from the game loot wise, will grow in power back to where they were, and the casuals will remain casual.
---
I'd be fine with that too... Like the mmo style but without all those annoying mmo mechanics and stuff that make it feel like a job. 
---
So you're saying you want your power armor to be tuba-charged?
---
A title next to their name: "the Chaste"
---
I'm not going to lie, there's bugs. But those bugs felt really dealable within 1 month of release. Literally, I felt like every game crash or bad experience I had was squashed within the first month. And for a game that's never gone multiplayer, that felt awesome.
---
I feel like the bugs they're trying to fix right now is for 1% of the gamers. I feel like they've definitely used this like an excuse to delay content.
---
I wish they fixed the bugs before they released a remaster of a game, sure.. but I feel like they've gone too far trying to fix bugs, too fast, for a newly made multiplayer game.
---
That's exactly the issue. And a small cosmetic is nothing in comparison to what everyone is asking for
---
I just keep waiting for that Pip-Boy skin with the stickers. Like where is it?
---
Except it doesn't make sense. Because they say they use weight to limit item tracking requirements for the server. Weight has nothing to do with "how many items" the server can track. If the server can only track 50 items per player maybe set our limit to 50 items. It makes more sense. Or you know finish the game instead of abandoning it. 
---
Yawn. Keep whining, cupcake.
---
It's not a coaster, it's a big deal in a pvp game, knowing if someone is level 24 or 247. How such a glaring oversight festers for months is discouraging.
---
To be fair the beach boys doesn't come to mind when I think of Fallout.
---
I guess I just disagree since I've made it to level 100 and I've never used sneak or TSEs.  I've been having lots of fun. To each their own I guess, we're not going to agree. 
---
That Super Duper only dupes the base ammo amount explains why I‚Äôm always slightly disappointed when baking up some 5.56.
---
nope, I'm not sure it's worth it. Go ahead.
---
Ya their design philosophy is all over the place, that's for sure haha
---
I can confirm.
---
I have only seen one but it was a dramatic experience.
---
Because if you got that high in level so quickly, you're a loser and should be shamed for your poor life choices.
---
They were doing good lately, price wise at least, but theres no reason that junk CA paint scheme should be 300 atoms more than the 3 others that are available all the time. I really hope no one is that gay for America to buy it, at least not at that price. 
---
Ugh, i just want cool shit.. Are they really wasting their time developing this corny shit just to make it available for one day? (Thats probably why they overpriced it, so anyone who does buy it makes up for everyone who doesnt)
---
Blackbird was good as a limited. I missed out, but that adds value to those who nabbed it. Croche hat, Patriotic CA, and two tone door??? Why the fuck are these "limited"? Id feel like an asshole after the fact for spending the money, rather than "whew! Glad i didnt miss that one!"
---
If you like that stuff, thats cool with me, but itd be nice to sign on and actually be into something on that list, as oppose to "well, at least i can have a different door than everyone else... Too bad it doesnt match any walls!!"
---
We could have Overwatch and be redesigning core gameplay how many years into release? Not to mention a completely redone/incomplete storyline and world. There is ton of things that need to be fixed in F76, but I've endured worse releases.

There's been a bug going on for weeks where if trying to modify armor, despite having more than enough materials to modify the armor, I'll get a message saying "you lack the requirements to create this item". It's been discussed on another thread and the consensus is that having all materials in the stash box will fix this bug. But I can assure you that it doesn't.
---
Uhhh I used the .308 Combat Rifle Receiver as my low mob killer for quite some time.  Know plans from breaking them down.
---
How much per Map? I'd be looking to buy most if not all of them just to be clear lol, so what's a bulk price?
---
ok
---
Fisher prime where you fight the Bass queen
---
You're a buffoon, a complete imbecile. More experience playing video games gives me more data to create better predictions about  video games in the future.
---
This was brilliant lol, thanks for that
---
Well there are players who think Missile launcher does good dps. So yeah I guess we'll leave it here.
---
Have you ever watched the sun go down?
---
Thinkin' bout how the world's spinnin' 'round and 'round?
---
Have you ever been high as fuuuuuck?
---
You can get by with only three points spent on your preferred weapon though - you don‚Äôt need to spend all nine to be viable in the end game.
---
The system had a lot of potential for damage optimization in combat - but it‚Äôs by no means mandatory for success.
---
I have a buddy who runs a pistol build with a focus on junk hauling and max DR and another team mate that has all three lockpicking and hacking perks up at all times and is pretty effective as a non vats sniper. 
---
I like that the system is both limited and varied - it makes sense as a response to fo4 where there were a ton of options but no real limitations - which ended up making every playthrough feel pretty much the same.
---
\+karma
---
They‚Äôre nerfing TES by alot.
---
What i imagine will happen is i will come across a player with full assassin/sentinel gear, hit him for 5 damage, then get blasted in the face with a radium gun.
---
Or,
---
I‚Äôm just walking thru a dark forest, then boom! 
---
Killed by someone stealthed in one hit. 
---
&gt; they expect the current content to hold for 4 months
---
Of course they do, that's why they've been nerfing XP. Don't be surprised if they nerf it more. 
---
Probably the same one that made the Race Car bed. It's called equality so the little girls that had race car beds are on the same level as the little boys with pretty castle beds.
---
I don't know what the average player experienced, I just know that I usually had less than 1 crash in 5+ hours of game play. It really didn't feel like an issue considering your average gamer probably didn't play that long at a time.
---
I feel like a few of their updates created more issues than they fixed, meaning there was more crashes.. but I don't feel like they should have delayed new content because of a few people that are having ridiculous issues.
---
In either case, the players that have been here since release or close, there's no reason we couldn't be getting new features or content as the bugs get fixed.. they're just simply listening to the wrong players.
---
Wow was easier than other MMOs at the time, that was a selling point. They didn't notice any problems, I remember months of zepplins dropping people even though it was the primary mode of transportation. Imagine crashing everytime you Fast traveled. Also, while their exp grind was a bitch to start, it was nothing compared to things that came before like Everquest or City of heroes which would punish you for dying with exp debt.
---
Okay but there's four electrical plans you get from them, the forth it the fusion core. It's not a grind.
---
Beat me to it. D2 ftw
---
give me glass walls and a roof, also give us wallpaper for other types of walls. all we have at the moment is fancier looking floors.
---
You can mod the UI to fit it correctly.
---
Both are likely 
---
But other players barely ever effect your game, what you want is probably more content that wasn't meant to appeal to a more open multilayer world ironically put in a game where you can go almost your whole time playing without a meaningful interaction from a player.
---
Wall paper is a great idea, I think those glass walls and floors would be cool, but I'd want glass second level floors too then lol
---
But what if you're both at 25k caps you can't take any more
---
Well, didn't mean that it was harder, just that to level to 60 took several months of gameplay.  I have a feeling that Bethesda had a similar expectation that it might take several months to reach level 50, which is about what it's taken me as a casual player.  
---
I still don't really understand how some players have reached level 150 or 200.  Unless they are playing 12 to 15 hours a day?  I play the game a lot, but admittedly not a max/min player like I used to be in wow.
---
Same, some people have a hard time &amp; you come in as their savior. 
---
Don't have to jump factions when you have 4 spare character slots.
---
...not what I was getting at, but you're right. That doesn't make sense.
---
Oh okay I never played that dlc
---
I think you are misunderstanding what Im saying. You are now focusing on if I claim a workshop. As I said before. Ya I get it.
---
But what Im talking about is beyond workshops......
---
And..."stick to PVE and co-op" does not matter when the indivuduals that are 200+ your level can still one shot you even if you dont fight back and they hunt you down via seeing a gathering of your "co-op" friends on the main map....
---
At the very least, hide them.
---
Cool. A level 11 has a bounty. I‚Äôm totally gonna wreak him.  
---
*Le me dies after realizing it‚Äôs a 118*.  
---
Fuck.
---
Oh yeah, that's Chicken Tent. I've been there. Nice place
---
Acid, I hate looking for it. I usually suck at finding acid. I have all the mats except lead, which I have a lot of ore for. That needs my small supply of trucking acid. You get the picture?
---
this is why we need chat... in real mmorpg u can scroll back on chat to check what u got...

Instigating sucks. Useless for pvp. Useless against the queen. Great for mid level mobs but so are grenades.
---
It's more like nobody wants to PVP griefers and griefer don't really want a fair fight.
---
I don't know that many people have issues with there being item weight and carrying capacity. I mean I understand your whole spiel... And that's great... But Bethesda is using it (in 76 not past titles) to limit the number of items a player will hold on to and there by reduce server "tracking" requirements. Because I guess they've never heard of a database before. Who knows. 
---
This bug actually made for a fun encounter for me. Played with a youtuber for a bit without realizing it: https://youtu.be/Zw-TiPX3u14?t=365
---
I appear at 6:07
---
Both instigating and aa can spawn with explosive. Which is best depends on purpose. If your goal is to one shot stealth kill, then instigating would be better. If you're using the weapon with the expectation that multiple shots will be required (sbq fights), then aa would be better in the long run, which is probably why most tse users are now running for aa weaponry 
---
Not sure that interpretation is correct. I suspect you only get the increased rate if you are on fire.
---
Please test and report back.
---
But you can vats threw the smoke. 
---
Nope. I only keep one frame for my use. I may have one spare kicking around, but I'm planning to get rid of it.
---
Low health and high damage. Great if you can pull it off but the definition of a glass cannon.
---
I‚Äôm thinking instigator weapons will now be the snipers best choice. Coincidentally, I just picked up a three star instigating Dragon the other day.
---
Choices are the essence of life. I‚Äôm sorry you are a hoarder.
---
Ive had to zoom in on level 20s in Bog only to see its level 210 and they dont need my help
---
I do agree that it make quality of life better with heavy weapons though xD
---
Yeah. I was leve 60 or something and saw a 50 cap bounty on a level 12 character. I fast traveled, got to the building they were in, rounded the corner and fired off a shot with my shotgun. Their health took a dip but I wuickly realized they were actually a level 120 player and I shot them while they were taking on 3 or 4 ghouls. I noped the heck out of their right quick.
---
Yeah I dont think they anticipated hitting 100 in a week or two after release. Even without the cheats, farming whitesprings may have been an oversight.
---
It didn't feel like they even tried with the level scaling. It doesn't get harder as you go on, if you find the 'right' weapon, you can become a God. Still, this is kinda par for the course of a fallout game. The real gameplay limiters seems like my carry weight and lack of direction after the main storyline.
---
Fair point, I was kinda just thinking pve for some reason, but yes useless against another player or really anything you aren't soloing.
---
Sum people want to make room for their friend joining to fight the queen &amp; the server is full.  They may ask nicely then leave you alone; if you say no, they grief you to leave the server.
---
Probably to save time, just grief you from the start w/ no questions asked. 
---
That is the error code for your Bethesda.net account being banned 
---
You don't like nonsensical and pointless magic and level scaling weapons bro? Here's a 50 Cal hunting rifle that does 20 damage and a 32. pipe pistol that explodes on hit, shoots two bullets and does 130 dps.
---
Regarding legendaries, I meant they have had more time farming them or (possibly) more caps to buy them. 
---
To keep you on your toes.
---
You've got it man, didn't mean to step on toes. Offer withdrawn.
---
&gt;community just sides with the griefers.
---
What are you talking about 
---
Okay, thank you.
---
Side question, does the AA prefix stack with AA magazines you can put on some of the guns? What about the tank killer perk? Not exactly sure how AA affects total damage. 
---
theres another cave spot with an acid resource inside it, south of the south vault
---
How much HP does vampires give you?
---
I have it on one weapon but doesn't seem to give much HP back 
---
Is it a % of damage dealt or based on a SPECIAL stat or what?
---
Honestly I think the pvp servers are needed asap bc 1. They're quick to setup 2. Many people who wanted to play fo76 didnt play bc of the pvp and this would bring in more money to help revive the game. I honestly think that this will bring in many more players (ex. I have 4 friends getting the game now bc of this pvp mode and I normally play solo bc nobody else wants to play it) and these players are buying the game and keeping it alive. This could be the quick redemption somewhat that fallout 76 needed. And I'm sure that once they bring in these new players, they will start adding DLCs (they said DLCs will be free) and endgame stuff for all of the old and new players.
---
didn't expect that, thanks. Well, what does OP say?
---
The return of PAM
---
This is all a secret ploy to bait out all the dupers/exploiters in one server.
---
No üß¢ 
---
Hey now, we can *definitely* agree those people are wrong. 
---
I'm on PS4. I will join you but we do things my way. We go where I want to go. We do what I want to do. Don't worry kid, stick by my side and we will go far. You just HAVE to listen to me. Don't ask what happened to the last guy who said he would, but didn't. I taught him real quick.
---
Honestly, not sure. Haven't had much chance to experiment with how aa impacts in the end. I do tend to put the mid-range armor piercing magazine with the slight expanded capacity on my range weapons as I like not having to reload overly often while still getting some armor penetration.  Add to that, I also have a max rank tank killer perk, so most creatures don't tend to have much left in the way of armor in the end
---
Games been out for almost 3 months. You think people have lives?
---
I still cant beleive they fixed the non issue with the cans over it eating ammo and gear.
---
To be fair they said they were "aiming" for a January release, they are now aiming for March along with the Survival update. There are to possibilities either the pve content isn't ready yet and I personal would prefer they get it ready  then push it out for an arbitrary deadline, the other possibility is they want to combine the pve and pvp content into a big patch for marketing reasons
---
Never used the blackpowder rifles before. I actually switched from a modded hunting rifle to the lever action because of the slow fire rate. Is the dragon really that godly that it's worth the extra reload time?
---
people treat this more as a coop game like Borderlands than an actual MMO. kinda annoying but hey, higher expectations, unrealistic almost, every year.
---
Like that guy who collected All the Baskets!
---
It does more than double damage, my bloodied explosive gauss can get up to 3531 damage before any bobbles or magazines.
---
Give your excess to the litte noobies.
---
It would make more sense if it was "join world" then "join survival world" beneath that.
---
Yeah...it‚Äôs not a perfect system lol
---
More than double damage!?
---
They are punishing us for being insolent. We have demanded too much.
---
What a shitty POV to have. you realize this game has been out for 3 months now right?
---
Clearly not the people that hit level 100.
---
Well, would you take my caps or my TSE Handmade?
---
I could be wrong, but I don't think too many players hitting over-stressed servers is the issue. ESO runs well afaik. 
---
This game engine was never designed to serve as a client in an MMO, and it wasn't all that stable in FO4 to begin with. And this series has never had server software, so who knows how that was cobbled together, it could be buggy too. On top of that, they're adding patches and hot fixes on the fly to try fix hundreds, maybe thousands of issues while at the same time they try to prevent cheating, hacks, and exploits.
---
Sort of a worse case scenario all around, tbh.
---
.308 or .38?
---
I've scrapped at least several hundred combat rifles and haven't even seen something like that. The closest is the .38 Receiver plans you can buy from vendors. Do you have a screenshot?
---
The missile tracking mod seems tailor made for these airborne targets... yet missiles are so bad against them. Makes me sad :( I still throw a few out sometimes, usually trying to get an airborne execute on a low health scorchbeast for the cool factor, but man...
---
Between the low damage per second, low durability of the launchers, and rarity+high cost of the ammo, they just aren‚Äôt an effective weapon. Unreliable, expensive, and ineffective- why would anyone want to use them?
---
However Bloodied is top. Period.
---
lol k, loser
---
Oh my bad.  Yah .38.  I miss read it.  Sorry
---
They all stack, but you're going to want to go low health with bloodied weapon and adrenal reaction mutation
---
The fact that it wasn't in the inside the vault makes it feel like it will be a very small content release like a new outfit for something. It is even more disconcerting that he didn't specify what it was.
---
I'm not trying to fight you over it, I'm just saying my experience with high level players has been overwhelmingly positive. I do occasionally come across griefers, but it seems rare compared to other games.
---
4-6 per session per day and the bugs and server stability is still garbage..... needs to get cleared up before new content..... also no fucking clue what they changed  graphics wise but I had to drop my display to 720p after the Jan 11 update to make it not crash to desktop every 5-7 minutes.
---
Obviously you don't understand the concept of having multiple armors for multiple situations.
---
Also I like to collect not hoard.
---
No problem. Was just confused at first.
---
I used to use a .38 combat rifle until I got a +25% fire rate Pipe Rifle.
---
Well then, im still on board üëç haha
---
Implying it even takes that long to get to level 100.  Takes a month of moderate play at most. If you're not level 100 and you've played since release... I can't fathom how you're playing it.
---
Yes, I forgot the exact numbers but somebody I talked to had tested. Apparently, even if two shot did true double damage, it cannot keep up with bloodied, especially paired with adrenal reaction.
---
Okay cool üòÅ
---
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **4th Cakeday** N3utro! ^(hug)
---
What do you mean, "fixed"? This is obviously the future of gaming!
---
(/sarcasm)
---
I might just keep it then
---
That's a genuine good explanation. But maybe you should be able to hack your pipboy to hide your presence from the network if you have the skill. Or if you're a Bethesda game designer, you can just crouch.
---
This happens to me with lots of items. I think there's a timer for how long you have to wait before you can pick it again.
---
.
---
That would be better than the .308. it does more damage than the .45 but less than the .308 (if holding true to the same damage compared to the hunting rifle). It's be a good compromise
---
Probably banned.
---
Ya ya. I hear ya. And mine HAVE been usually too. But this week. Damn.
---
I get what you are saying now.
---
Then it would never spin
---
they should make them like 4 times as  big too and like radiate half the map
---
What platform you on?
---
well, there is different quality players...
---
i carry:
---
\-two shoot gaus gun
---
\-tesla rifle
---
\-1000amo for gaus, 2-3000 for tesla
---
\-buff food and chems
---
\-water
---
\-readaway a lot and rad-x.
---
\-30 stimpack
---
\-one set of non power armor gear
---
\-a set of x01 power amor
---
\-6 power core
---
\-few junk items
---
this is what u need kill qbq or solo farm nuked zones liek whitespring
---
and i use 2x3 point card in strength, a 3pont battery card, have marsupial muation and  and two +50carry on pa legs. the stuff what i need carry 195kg when my max carry is 240kg without pa and 310 in pa. but my non pa gear is deep poketed and few part of them have \~20% weigth reduce. so if i change to pa my "virtual" weigth also incerase... so after i get few legendary weapon and other important materials i cant fast travell. its about 20-30min gameplay. and i have to make along walk ot my mule character.
---
and for this is have to waste 9point in this perk system. so i like when peoples say: this system is fine i have a pipe rilfe and some kind of non legandary gear and i can kill ghoils by lurin to turets.
---
btw the simple solution of this desing falure if the devs allow is fast travell with overweigth.
---
&gt;like nuke zones but without the long drawn out quest to trigger the event
---
Kinda disagree I wouldn't say 20-30 mins is a long drawn out process. But I enjoy silo runs so could just be me. 
---
I definitely agree with you're idea though it would be awesome and bring players together, even low levels or people who don't enjoy the rads of nuke zones.
---
well, is 8k +tse ok for you? always wanted to try a tse, but i know they will nerfed into oblivion  in the next patch tho. :P
---
Internet connection...?
---
"Two shit explosive" - me after eating too much dairy.
---
Probably because it‚Äôs a 60s era song. Doesn‚Äôt match the 1950s atomic age at all. 
---
Xbox, yourself?
---
Well, I guess yes. I still think it's kinda too much, but whatever. Let's do it. IGN: LGeo.
---
I play a survivlast. Basically perks to make me not take rads from water. Keep my food longer. Make my shit weigh less (food,meds, junk)  I also have the perk that in the day time my rads go away. Little bit of damage perks as well so I can pve
---
Odd question, but where in the build inventory is the electric chair? I swear I've searched from recent to misc and can't find it, I know unused the plans.
---
Hadn't seen that before.
---
Hell yes I want a Pipboy with a Tesla sticker on it! 
---
Seriously? Wow I don't know why my account was banned thanks I guess 
---
Someone always seems to find them just before me......
---
Seen the Mothman once when I was a very low level on the bridge going into Charleston.  Proper freaked me out. Big red eyes just staring at me in the distance. So I ran in the opposite direction very quickly.
---
Have yet to find the fleetwood monster (not sure if that's his correct name but the purple alien dude I mean) so still a few surprises to be had yet.
---
then why haven't i gotten an email letting me know i got banned? I thot that they were suppose to email you to let you know you are banned? Been trying to get customer service but they just keep sending me to voicemail, and when i do finally talk to someone they just say that they can't help? if i got banned thats fine, i would at least like to know, ya know.
---
just a question: how much nuke u launched? let me guess: zero. but u have opinion...
---
check spam
---
That's good advice.  
---
What is your definition of of "moderate play?"
---
Not that! Definitely not that.. it just says login error to bathesda.net
---
Ill trade something!!
---
I‚Äôm just passing along what I‚Äôve learned. I‚Äôve never found the plan so if you ask me I‚Äôd have to say it‚Äôs a myth
---
In the guide it said there were rad-Owls as well, hopefully one day I'll find one.

Two whacks with my trusty fire axe usually does the trick

Is there a way I can get the ban removed?
---
If it makes you feel any better, bunker buster‚Äôs legendary effect is bugged, it only does like 1 more damage than a normal one.
---
I've got the code for silo alpha 
---
Restart your Device. That usually works for me.
---
I think it's just literally a smoke screen. 
---
k. Hoarders believe they are saving critically important things that need to be collected too.
---
People did in the beta. They had to know from their own testing how that'd appear. I normally don't agree when people say that devs are lazy or that adding/changing one thing would be so simple, but this *has* to be a simple fix.
---
Did and nothing! 
---
I have all of them just go on nukecrypt
---
WOOBY
---
What lv are you
---
I lost both a jet pack and calibrated shock mod (did not have flux to intall).  placed in my stash, Modded other things but after log in they disappeared.  Seems to happen only with the x-01  - not problem installing anything else and always kept them in stash but had to remove to review what was needed. Wasted caps and time; glad I'm not losing my mind. Hey, Bethesda, used to be that I'd get a message about utilizing said item if modding or repairing away from stash. Would be helpful.
---
I can dupe 1 for you
---
It bothers especially when i see a bounty of lets say 20 or 30 caps and im like oh this is easy a lvl 14 player oh piece of ca...ohhh thats lvl 140 oh no nvm dont want to die today
---
even if it had no bugs they made a boring lame game. all fetch quests. BS audio logs and txt logs nobody cares to listen to etc bad graphics bad missions bad enemies. many games who go online for their first time have bugs but never to this extent/ games with 10x less the budget this game had have done 1000x better. they had a big budget and did awful bug wise, indie games do much better even their first games, was so bad there is a class action lawsuit LOL
---
\+karma thx for trade
---
Been doing it for the last week.. i just uninstalled it, and going to reinstall and maybe that might fix the problem
---
I'd buy the SHIT out of a FO game made by Obsidian.
---
For me this does add something fun to the game. It forces you into making tough decisions about what type of character you want to play. It also encourages trading/giving stuff away which makes the game more interesting IMO.
---
Don't you just sell for approx. 10 percent of the value and with hard bargain you get another 10-15 percent? 
---
+karma thanks for the gun. Hope it'll be good after the patch :)
---
Playstation :/ womp womp haha
---
I actually dont know, my health doesn't drop too far and when it does ghoulish and my helsing factor fix it too fast for me to have measured it.
---
Rip lol
---
Good luck. So far I've found two, and zero plans. BTW here are some things you might want to know to save some heartbreak:
---
1. The plan for the handmade *should* spawn from the Harper's Ferry vendor, but the vendor is bugged so if you are over a certain level it won't show you the plan if it has it. Might get fixed, might not.
---
2. The only other way to semi-reliably get the plan is as an event reward for "Patrol Duty" at the prison
---
If you run with a low health build, if you are OCD about your health, then bloodied is situationally good at best. Course, at that point, should also be running with adrenal reaction and a full set of sentinel gear to stay alive while running low health
---
Yeah it just sucks tho you know. And I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs only me but why can‚Äôt I sell ammo to the boy vendors. 
---
On the topic of Grahm, has anyone seen his vicious badassery in combat like jesus christ. Butcher pete wont even cut it for this dude.
---
Look at this guy with coasters
---
I miss EverQuest. And I miss games that punish you for dying. It actually adds a bit of panic and adrenaline to a good fight. 
---
Now I drop a couple pieces of garbage when I die. *And I can walk right over and pick it back up."
---
I‚Äôve launched several myself and killed enough queens that I have nearly every Prime receiver. I‚Äôve done it on both a 15str power armor-Heavy weapons-explosives build that runs around at about 700lbs in combat loadout as well as on a 1str stealth-vats-sniper build that literally only has a token weight reduction perk on that one strength, and runs around at about 120lbs normal loadout. It‚Äôd be zero strength if I could put that point somewhere else.
---
I understand the consequences, and make choices based on them. 
---
It‚Äôs not complete yet there will be more coming 
---
My guess? They never expected anyone to play that long.
---
Oh, so no one can complete It? 
---
Is this near the ammo workstation?
---
Thanks for proving my point. Why would I want to spend my free time with sub humans like you?
---
Thanks cuzzy
---
You still have the coat, lol, saw this post from looking up traveling leather coat on google. I got a ton of chems I‚Äôve been hoarding 
---
That's it. I cant reason with this level of fucking stupid.
---
It seems like it can't be completed at the moment. Not sure if by design due to future plans or bug. 
---
I'm far from a super hardcore minmaxer or anything like that. I mostly pick what's available and useful at the time (in any game). In fo76 i've gravitated toward stealth. My A. is pretty high, and IMO the best defense is being able to literally stand in front of monsters who never see you. No need for superawesomedamage if you're never attacked.  
---
[Tl:dr: I sneaky.](https://imgur.com/a/suBL26W)
---
My main character is maxed out on rifleman, giving me a base damage of 380 or so. X2 for stealth + x2 for instigating gives me a first volley of 1520. After that I don‚Äôt even bother reloading - just switch to my Executioner Handmade.
---
my favorite part is when the item that isn't listed weights 38 pounds and you spend 15 minutes dumping out junk and ammo and other stuff before you realize 'oh, it gave me 2 nukes and a launcher'
---
....and then you drop the nukes and the launcher because 18 points of damage isn't worth lugging around a weapon that heavy.
---
I mean, you can just shoot through the smoke. I'm surprised how many people actually use VATS. It seems more disabling than helpful in this iteration.
---
Was running through the ash heap and tried. Can confirm one thing: fire bad. 
---
Its laggy as hell period. Hit registration is shit. And based on posts here, why would anyone want to play with the kind of people chiming in to support pvp?
---
Your Bethesda.net account was closed because you either personably duped or were in possession of mass amounts of duped items. 
---
(2 nukes and a launcher that weigh almost 50 pounds combined)
---
Definitely Egosoft is fantastic for such a small company.
---
Try standing in that smoke ^.^
---
WHAAAAT?!?! I had no idea
---
Scorchbeasts are supposed to be a nemesis, not something to be farmed.  
---
Why do you assume that every opponent should give rewards commensurate with the difficulty of defeating them?
---
SO SAY WE ALL
---
This is a really interesting.
---
Idea but wtf is going .
---
On with this formatting.
---
It makes about as much.
---
Sence as a paid PvP.
---
Service in fallout 76.
---
I had an instigating Combat Rifle I made .38 that with Concentrated Fire &amp; Gun Fu lead to one shot head shots while farming Morgan School and such
---
Huh. Well thanks for clarifying, I couldve sworn I shared two, I guess I didnt notice it turned the other off. 
---
Lol bulk adhesive and springs worth the most to vendors 
---
Coming from a long time destiny player - I think a few more things could be implemented into fo76 that destiny did amazingly well....
---
whats the bug with harpers ferry vendor? iv never had a problem there
---
His award for a sexless life üòÇ
---
 I have found several and as this char was created to acquire the Hand Made Rifle plans I have tested the parameters.
---
 It does not drop from level 13 to level 15. It does drop between level 15 and level 20. It does not drop after level 20.
---
 Now you can, I believe, acquire them from the Patrol Event at the Penitentiary.
---
More and more in starting to agree. As an avid reader, nothing in this game comes remotely close to the books I have read in terms of quality. I dont play games, to read books. And Bethesdas gross over dependence on note, journal entries and the intelligence insulting "lore book" crap is so tired.
---
Prediction: this will be one of the first official mods, and you'll spend atoms to buy it.
---
I have a 2 shot Gatling gun with 90% red weight and I ap refresh 
---
That's really bad. And really telling.
---
a red barn should have wooden shingles as a roof option, not the same tin sheets that you get with the metal plans.
---
Yes! Feel free to add me (TriforceOfBacon) and we can meet up in-game!
---
I'll be on soon after work  I'll hit you up
---
Yep
---
True beauty
---
Yes.
---
Blaming the world for your own deficiencies is not a valid argument.
---
Sure.
---
The first time around.
---
Then what?
---
i seen one at WS today as well by the train station entrance 
---
Cuz its not a pvp game duh 
---
Not to disagree (I've run into some of the same issues), but some tips on flux farming:
---
* Green thumb perk gets you double nuked flora (and all other flora, for that matter).  Then you only need to harvest five plants for each stable flux.
---
* Super Duper perk so you have a chance of getting double the stable fluxes.
---
* Whitespring is nigh impossible to harvest enough violet for a single stable batch.  I don't even bother.  Several of the snap tails are bugged so they don't produce nuked flora.  Everything else is in abundant supply there (if you know where to look!), but violet is just...I wouldn't even try.
---
* The "Prime" site is the best for violet!  There's "flash fern" around all the tree clusters.
---
* I make sure to count what I'm harvesting, since all the components and the inert flux they become weigh so damn much.  I don't want more or less than I need.
---
* I don't even bother harvesting flora if I don't have enough of the other three components (hardened mass, high radation fluids, and...is it glowing mass?).  They drop more randomly, so I plan around them.
---
* I'm not sure if this is by design, but I think you can't harvest plants that other people have harvested.  They may show fruit/flowers still, but you can't get em.  I've also noticed that they appear to have new fruit/flowers if you fast travel away/go into an interior cell and come back, but you can't re-harvest.  Shows the message you can, but never works.
---
Hope that helps!  And I hope BS makes more progress on the stability front.  Last update was worse for me too.
---
imagine survival mode:  "**I have killed up to 8 three star legendaries...before a lvl15 TSEd me and stole all my junk and chems and ammo...and not one of them has dropped a weapon with more then one legendary perk... is this normal?** "
---
Still have some? I would buy it or I could trade a carnivorous serum. 
---
Nope, not even close actually üòä
---
I shot someone‚Äôs camp 3 times with my daisycutter before and got no bounty it must be your game
---
This is not untrue, playing the demo right now. Demo is supposed to be like 6-8 week old version with a ton of updates.
---
That being said Im sure this will replace 76 for me on release. The devs are far better at communication and fixing issues than 76 devs have been, and its been demo for less than 1 day. Plus when its working games pretty damn fun.
---
If it was that easy, there wouldn't be any rare weapons or armor
---
related but unrelated: I saw a camp set up next to white springs to leech off kills and get easy loot for little to no effort so i decided to destroy their entire camp and server hop, i know being a jerk is frowned upon but i strongly feel those players shouldnt benefit from my hard work. My point is, wanted should if it doesnt already carry on with each server you enter so you feel the consequences of messing with other players.
---
I'm not blaming the world for my deficiencies, I'm not even playing the game for starters. I'm blaming the developers/publishers for the games deficiencies and lack of end-game content and not giving players other things to do at end-game other than grief.
---
But sure, if you insist, oh wise one.
---
No. We dont need raids and bosses. The last fucking thing this game needs, is scripted, rinse and repeat content. The more this game copies from typical MMOs the more players it will push away.
---
End game stuff needs to be solo friendly. It needs to allow exploration. Freedom of approach. Raids are the last thing we need.
---
think the damage is bugged only appears to add accuracy per shot
---
Maybe someday we'll get some more options with camp builds 
---
Still looks Dwemer to me, but that's probably just because it was made by the same artists, in the same game engine. 
---
Ok?....
---
Yep! Would be amazing to have the &lt;name&gt; of the set and the current &lt;paint scheme&gt; of the set available in the name.
---
For example: 
---
* Excavator Standard Power Armor
---
1.    "Standard" meaning default skin, no paint applied 
---
2.    Could alternately be: Excavator Power Armor No delineation other than "Excavator", because no paint scheme applied (ie. default skin) 
---
* T-45 Northern Lights Power Armor 
---
* T-51b Tricentennial Power Armor 
---
* T-60 Brotherhood Initiate Power Armor
---
* X-01 Blackbird Power Armor
---
*  Ultracite Standard Power Armor
---

Overwatch is actually fun and responsive though. Playing Tracer and blinking everywhere, unloading your smg pistols into someone before rewinding time for yourself. Playing Genji and headshotting a sniper with her own bullet by deflecting it back at her. Playing Lucio and wall riding while speeding up/healing your teammates, and booping enemies off cliffs or into bottomless pits. 
---
All of these feel amazing, and there's an insane depth to all of the 28 or 29 heroes. And they release 2 or 3 heroes a year, plus new maps and game modes (secondary to cosmetics).
---
To compare Fallout 76 to Overwatch doesn't really work. 
---
Honestly, TSE is still going to be a contender for top spot. It just won't be far and away the best anymore.
---
i would have kept it, but i failed to get get a suppressor after dismantling over 20 rifles. i simply gave up lul.
---
I am indeed. I was accounting for all the synergistic synergies that synergize oh so beautifully.
---
i 'seeked revenge' on someone yesterday and he just stood there taking slap damage and looking at me before he left. super fun.
---
Or maybe some form of a daily/weekly event that triggers at a specific time in all servers that is similar in player requirements
---
Good, good to hear.   
---
Though...what we've heard about this Survival mode and PVP thing....this is exactly the thing many long time fans have lodged complaints against. It sounds perfectly fine to me, if it's implemented as a separate mode. But I hope this doesn't become a priority over Adventuring,Exploration, PVE, and all of other, more "passive" things we love about this series.
---
I hope the server issues are fixed, soon. Besides a fair, well more then fair, amount of microstuttering on Xbox one, I have been actually kicked out more then once and have had a number of pauses when bringing up the map, entering a zone, or even during combat.
---
Good move.
---
Fisher Price is where it's at
---
I completely agree that they should do this!  It would discourage server hopping too.  (although, atm server hopping is necessary for some things, soooo...)
---
But I have a tip: team up with someone.  If only one of you get bumped from the server, you can "join" them back on the same server.  I don't know if your scrap will de-spawn when you DC, but if it doesn't at least your teammate will have a chance at grabbing it for you, and you'll be able to continue whatever battle you were in.
---
That's a workaround, but hopefully it's something until we get a fix.
---
So I made my camp on the little lake near vault 76. The one that has the bees nest. Everyday a bunch of cats spawn on my front lawn but a little while after I see them they randomly fall over and die. I have no idea why
---
Aw shoot. No 2mm, no dice. Gotta have me some of that. Ive got a large stickpile so its worth it to you my friend. Write me when you have 341 rounds of 2mm to give me. No less than that I will accept. Sorry bud.
---
There are still major stability and balance issues. Bethesda needs to address these core issues before moving on to new content. Not sure the "Survival" servers count as new, as they took all of ten minutes to edit a few game settings.
---
Yeah, I did something similar by artillery bombing one of the 150 level Whitespring leechers. I had 10 caps when I left and 280 when I reentered. It carries from server to server.
---
I'm on ps4 and I have a rather stable experience esp. the last update. 1 crash every other day or so after long sessions so I'd say better than before..yes lots of click bait and lots of salty ppl willing to view it... I'd expect s ok me new content with the new mode to keep both sides happy. But the new mode is jus that, an adjusted for.at to what we play a now(I cant wait but I guess I have to!!!). Content takes alot more time than removing simple restrctions. I have had a good time on ps4!! But I cant wait til the new mode tbh!!!
---
Level shouldnt really show after 50 anyway. 
---
Not to be confused with fisher price, where you find the plastic queen
---
Well, there is no logic in having, for example, a rifle, weighing 2x a PA frame with all armor parts that is, conceptually, a whole tank in your inventory (and don't start on how you could have THAT in your inventory, or how a frame weighing essentially nothing, and made of what? aluminium? carbon? could hold 6 armor parts weighing each 4x its base weight). You can try to wrap your mind / text all around that all you want, it still makes no sense...
---
Weight is just a survival/inventory mechanism (and not a fun one) to keep people on their teeth.
---
&gt; They won't learn to not
---
r/ihadastroke
---
Destiny did very little that I would consider well. Other than charge players for the same game twice.
---
because the devs could never get over level 20 so they said what's the point....
---
I understand where you‚Äôre coming from, but typically part of the final number is cut off on the map so you‚Äôd see the 3rd number and go ‚Äúthere‚Äôs something more here‚Äù, no? At least whenever I‚Äôve seen it happen, a tiny part of the 3rd digit is visible
---
Add me, Ill "stop on by" muahahahaha hahaha haha ha muahahaha
---
I really don't have anything even remotely like your experience.   The game was a fucking train wreck at launch, and yeah, the un-addressed bugs in the patches are pretty horrible...I crash significantly more often now than I did before the latest patch, they pushed the patch KNOWING you can't use outside to outside elevators. 
---
And this game is only _two fucking months old_ expecting new content at this point is _stupid_. 
---
Where is Fisher Price on the map? I need to farm a bunch of plastic in my endless quest to make more shotgun shells.
---
I am too I must say. I feel bad for anyone who isnt. I truly get to log In n play and rarely have probs
---
I plan on buying it when it releases. How is the Beta? 
---
RNG is just a mystery, yesterday i've found two bolstering/marine right arms (both 3\* max lvl) at a distance of 2 minutes from each other, whitesprings farming
---
Better to burn out, than to fade awaaaaayyyyyyyy!
---
This made me laugh. I like your sass.
---
Hah, ring is wearable. I needed one more thing to add to my various useless accessories! Thanks for the info
---
Hey loved your cave, this is my camp in the same spot have a look friend :) you can make it so that nothing can get 
---
in or out and your stuff inside can't be damaged!! httpsboxdvr.com/gamer/eternalscourge/video/68109227
---
Or how about everyone helped eachother, and held hands, and skipped through the daisies helping eachother with quests, and went back to their camps, frolicking through the woods. Sounds like my type of game, count me in! Twice!
---
its a ban you should have an email in your spam folder.  you can appeal it if you feel like you haven't done anything wrong.
---
it's a pvpve game and pvp is one of those modes, just as important as pve. Bethesda realizes this, which is why they are creating Survival Mode to encourage more and better pvp.
---
Oh man if I could have one hour without bugs wrecking something...
---
Detox?
---
It's not actually a beta because it's extremely limited. It's a demo. And when it works, it's fun. But it's less playable than 76
---
I got fusion generator on my first Poseidon event on my melee toon. I still don't have the others unlocked. It's random which one you get not progressive. That being said I don't think it gives you dupe generator plans so in that regard it's a bit progressive. My rifle toon has everything but the fusion generator and my heavy weapons has everything but the windmill.
---
Ill give you a TSE gauss rifle and a Lv 45*** Sentinel Assassin +1 strength marine chest piece for it. Dont listen to that asshat, the weapon is worth WAY more.
---
Hahaha. I also love when people seek revenge against me when I kill them as they're wanted or they attack me. I once took down a group of 3 by sniping them off a cliff, they all sought revenge and I was just slowly walking away as 3 tse miniguns were fired into my back for five minutes! It was hilarious.
---
I saved all mine from start untill I got to the scorched queen invested in all the perks for explosives and low and behold it‚Äôs a fucking fire craker 
---
check your spam filter it might be in there.  also you can appeal it if you have the email.
---
You love how the game is broken?
---
Ahh, yeah I don't know why I said beta haha but I'm glad I didn't preorder for the demo, after all of the issues people had today lol glad you were able to get in and try it out, though.
---
Yes, you can sort of tell. But we shouldn't have to peer closely at something that's designed to provide extremely important information at a glance.
---
It's a significant GUIX failure and it must have been flagged by their internal QA, it's too obvious. But someone decided it wasn't a high priority.
---
I mean sure I can play it too. But have to constantly restart the entire thing too often. Even 76 "beta" wasn't this bad
---
Hopefully they use this chance to pentuple the servers lol, cuz most people couldn't even really do much in the demo for half of the day
---
You're saying we should be able to cancel a move as the move is done? An action is an animated movement? I mean, you grab something, you can't un-grab it.
---
Mainly because they‚Äôre propped up as some kind of ‚Äúboss creature‚Äù by the developers. They‚Äôre supposed to be one of most difficult creatures to beat in the game. 
---
Hey bro loved what ya did here my camps in same spot I made an underground nightclub just so you know the entrance behind where you have your security gate can also be 100% blocked off as well
---
Thanks? I'm sorry that you have Stockholm syndrome.
---
I dunno. Everyone I know personally, across all platforms, agree it's pretty fucking horrible still. I can't speak for every play, obviously, but...nah. It's just buggy and unstable. 
---
Man I just want a roof. 
---
*Looks up in sadness*
---
So, I can answer this after having made Imperfect 21x9 (although, other UI mods would probably be able to get specific).
---
It's stupidly simple. They didn't write that specific bit of text to actually be constrained into the space allowed. There's a few factors that dictate how that particular text is shown.
---
First, there's the box dictating the allowable 'visible' space. (this is why it's getting cut off instead of just overlapping the space next to it)
---
Second, it's not coded to remain constrained to the box, so the text doesn't resize itself, it's limited to the one size only.
---
Third, the visible box location and the text location are aligned by pixel placement. (moving them is a pain and a half)
---
So basically, if you make the size of the box a tad bigger, or make the level text a bit smaller, it'd probably fit fine. Preferably, you'd write in the programming portion of the level text for it to resize itself to fit the box (this is something I can't do, as I have no clue how, but it is done elsewhere, so it should be perfectly possible)
---
My bad I thought it was rng cause I saw people posting about not getting the plans lol
---
I went to Watoga Shops as level 38 and felt lucky to get out without dying. A lot of sneaking followed by a multi-robot/Assaultron siege in a shop. Never did find the trader I was looking for. Stumbled into the Deathclaw on the way back. Very educational. Too bad my weapons were crap.
---
It's not great but it's pretty funny when this weird stuff happens.
---
Yeah, it would tell us who to shoot first. :P
---
Because they sold us an alpha state game where the simplest issues hadn't been fixed and forgot moders wouldn't be able to fix everything this time
---
Why? The death bag is the killer's "reward". I could get behind a player becoming wanted for taking a death bag of someone they didn't kill, sure.
---
I have it on a nice cliff in Berkley Springs lol
---
All of my perks that can go to weight reduction do, and I hate it because I feel like I have to.
---
is is not great
---
You can fit more in the cave than you think https://xboxdvr.com/gamer/eternalscourge/video/68109227
---
Love it haha
---
Eh? Think your commenting in the wrong place man
---
Here's one of mine in the same spot bro if interested https://xboxdvr.com/gamer/eternalscourge/video/68109227
---
Wrong. I do. My weapons break after just a couple encounters, so I have to carry more. I run out of ammo quickly, so I have to carry more.
---
They didn't think anyone would play that long.
---
Rip üòì
---
what are you talking about? this game has may fucked up bugs in it, making it harder to play sounds like a not so great fix
---
Vats is decent if you are using a full rifle or pistol build with all the skills. Otherwise it‚Äôs useful for finding an enemy you don‚Äôt know is there then u exit vats and shoot them. 
---
There are rewards in final game for playing in demos tho
---
 Would be helpful.
---
You're still saying too that if you decide to go to sleep, yoy want to be still awake? It doesn't work that way man, not in the real world either, if you do something, you don't get to go back in time and not do it. Its like, I'm saying "time to rest" and then not wanting to rest, i already started resting so its going to take time to wake back up, our characters aren't robots that get powered up with a switch. A human being has to usually get their bearings and come to realization when the act of "waking up" is achieved. On a side note, if you figure out how to sleep without really sleeping, let me know!
---
Im actually kind of upset. With the theme of the week I was expecting maybe some monster PA paint, skins. More interesting stuff. So far; lamp, chandelier (I was actually waiting for that chandelier), girly hat, 2 tone door. Sometimes I feel like their efforts as so wasted on boring stuff.
---
Well, all the people thinking it was some sort of mmo that needed a group with different roles where certainly daydreaming, considering that FO76 is essentially a standard FO game with a co-op option added.
---
The most effective role choice is the one that allow you to kill efficiently and quickly, or without being seen, everything else is amusement. 
---
Add to that the fact that everyone can do everything with a swap of perks cards and differentiation is completely out of the window.
---
My bad, this isn't Santa's workshop?
---
As others have said, they are still in the game. They never explode for me though, they just follow me around wherever I go until I kill them, no matter how close they get. Maybe my not-so-great internet messes with them or something, but there are plenty of times I should have died by one but it just never detonated.
---
You need to use it while wearing the amulet and the garb. It's a full set or nothing thing.
---
Bethesda has lost touch with it's player base.
---
No bro, next post down
---
I'm sure that they will do the same thing in the new mode really.  I'm sorry you gotta deal with this and jus wait we will all get  more content soon and these dickheads will my prob in survival. No lifers will play 60+ hours a week while most of us work.. cant balance that ever. Good luck in the future and j be patient and new shit to do will roll in
---
Which event eats gear? I‚Äôve lost a few armor pieces over the last 2 weeks. Just vanished, without a trace.
---
Love stacking rad sponge and having 47m due to  my increased durations(also the negative 13% from healing Factor) using no PA in rad zones.
---
We appreciate your sacrifice in the name of science.
---
Definitely wendigo cave. 3 billions of those in a heartbeat. 
---
That's almost entirely technically impractical, and I doubt there's anywhere in the game world to actually fit this thing. 
---
The best idea would be an entirely instanced area where players get plots of land they can build freely in and interact with other players. Like a social hub, which we desperately need
---
Damn im 54, i wish i knew that before lol. I guess ill see about getting one another way. I know my friend sometimea gets legendary ones. Unfortunatly i wont get mods that way lol. 
---
So hostile, there there friend, come to my camp of sacredity and I shall show you the true ways of peace, and the error of your ways. Hostility is the path to sadness. Sadness is the path to hostility, you must break the chain if to ever be free. Quickly, hand over to me all of your worldly possessions. Do not question my child. Be at peace now. Shhhhhhhhh. Sleep now little one.
---
Honestly this 
---
i have seen at least 2 nukes stacked on each other (today no less) I would see no reason a 3rd wouldnt work too.
---
:/
---
bye insane person
---
Im in, lets fuck em right in the daddy!
---
Yes, my team has launched 3 on prime withing space of 10 seconds
---
The character doesn't even press the keys while playing, so I dont think that's too big of an issue, haha.
---
Speaking as a dev: 
---
It‚Äôs a cheap and easy implementation that‚Äôs been asked for since day one and has potential to bring in fresh blood or players who‚Äôve moved on.
---
Why *wouldnt* they focus on shipping out some PvP servers? It‚Äôs literally some table database manipulations and changing a couple event handlers for the *new* features.
---
They probably have something like a team of five working on this or some such. 
---
Just makes good business sense and most bang for dev time and effort.
---
Stupid question. But do the nukes not kill the SBQ?
---
Im on the other side loving these brown paper bag. They are everywhere when you look hard. Sometime im killing the other people too on "accident" to get those bags.
---
Do they damage the sbq
---
Im making a trump character and building a wall base. Other then memes grind for better gear and not to praised pvp system.
---
I like you
---
Huuuh. It's interesting to see those statistics. They really need to bake some of that in for PC as well...we don't even get time played data as far as i can tell. 
---
Bwahahahahah 
---
Do not rest until you have BiS gear for your build. For me it was a Bloodied explosive vats cost gauss rifle and my set of sentinel assassins legendary armor. You may never get all of what you need. And you will never be fully optimized until you do.
---
Damn, every time one of you says they're in the game I feel cheated.
---
My wife and I have over 300 hours combined, neither of us has seen one.
---
I have over 400 loose screws.  Still picking up that desk fan and globe.
---
‚ÄúTedious?‚Äù One extra selection? Seriously?
---
Drink from the sulpher fountain under the gazebo in whitesprings and the notification goes away.
---
Yes yes all the baskets are mine
---
Hmm, haven't tried full rifle or pistol builds yet. Shall have to see when I cross try those someday.
---
I've just been FPS-style blasting everything I have need to kill. Usually aware enough of my surroundings to kill everything I intend to (except sneaky people, haven't that tried). 
---
To each their own though! That's why we have variation of playstyle I suppose, eh?
---
No ward from Bethesda yet, so it's anyone's guess 
---
For me there's one at the West-Tek building every time. Apart from that they're very scarce.
---
I have :( Full 3 Star Unyeilding and a plethora of Bloodied weapons. Posting on reddit for a few more weapons, but that's about it.
---
Have you seen the things people mod into Bethesda games? A pink princess bed fits right in and is tame in comparison 
---
I want a third arm. One that has a mind its own and can fire a weapon when needed. Its name is Frank and he will also aid in masturbation.
---
Sounds like RNGesus had to press the Emergency stop button. 
---
"No RNGmary! I said *only* give 3* wood armor or lead pipes"
---
When picking a new perk, make sure the filter is open to all
---
Wow killed myself in a crack now im stuck on loading screen
---
I never could hit those.  I was too busy running away like a little girl.
---
50% movement speed reduction is a little aggressive haha 
---
I had 1100 loose screws when I fell into the fissure I was just starting to think that I had to start cutting down and a lack of attention took care that for me. Back up to 325 already though.
---
Cool!
---
I'm pretty sure this new game mode took very little effort to make all in all, it's just removing some restrictions and adding others after all. The main thing most of us can take from all this is that most people who would try to kill us on sight by stacking bobbleheads will probably move to the game mode made for them.
---
Every fight was fought with mini heart attacks. 
---
Possibly? I didn't get an email response or anything but I suddenly got a lot of points (though I did complete a few challenges.) I still have the dress though 
---
I mean your talking about dmg reduction. It‚Äôs very powerful so the price should be high besides *starched genes* 
---
I'm not sure it unlocks at exactly 30 but at lvl 80 there is no chance that you don't have it as available card to purchase with a perk point.
---
I‚Äôm playing a revolver build now and I can open vats and blast like 3 people away in 3 shots as fast as I can pull the trigger it‚Äôs kinda cool
---
I'm legitimately lost as to why you're fixated on this...   
---
They aren't going to "have more servers". Each \_virtual server\_ hosts 24 player maximum. This game is not going to have a significant player spike due to this, so the \_total\_ number of \_virtual server slices\_ won't change significantly, and if they DO, that means the game is growing, which means they're getting more revenue from micro transactions and so on.   
---
They're fine-tuning the balance changes, that's development time, but it, in no way, is \_increased server costs\_, either through increased server volume or increased maintenance. And as it's a somewhat frequently requested feature, that's in the direction they were trying to push the game from the first announcement, they're banking on this MAKING them more money, getting them more sales from the audience they are trying to tempt into this game.  
---
&gt; **Why don't player levels fit in the box on the map when over lvl 100?** 
---
Typical half-arsed Fallout76ism.
---
Yes, it was. I just spent the last 20 minutes searching..
---
Don't tell him that just like the Raiders do in Fallout 4,  Mole Miners attach mines to mole rats.  So if you hear beeping and don't see a Super Mutant Suicider, you bed your ass it's a mine laden mole rat.  Mole Miners play dirty.
---
Any pics?
---
\+99%, 100% being you died from zero health. 
---
My friend and I regularly go to nuke zones with lvl 3 rad sponge, which works wonders. We never have to worry about rads at all.
---
On top of that, the healing mutation makes it so we never really have to use stims or anything unless we really get beat on.
---
Also, we learned that we can mutation farm. One person gets out of PA for a bit, takes a ton of rads and usually mutates, then gets back in PA and rad sponges it away. Other person does the same. To continue the trend, close and restart the game then play with team. It resets the mutation checker so you can continue right away. Doing this, I now have every mutation (except carnivore since I got herbivore).
---
You could actually play it and find out since you own it already.  Decide for yourself if you are having fun or not.
---
I find some items(like turrets and workbenches) can't be interacted with(moved, scrapped, etc.) after you place them, aside from that everything works like you were building your own camp, except you don't have the ability to store things or use things from the stored tab. If the friend leaves the game their entire camp will vanish, including what you built, but since it's part of their camp it will be there next time they play.
---
Been there, saw a level 15 on the map with a 200 cap bounty, well I fast travel near him and I run into the building spraying, I see him he‚Äôs got full X0-1 power armor... after a second I thought wait what? And then it clicked he was actually a level 150... and then he whips around and one shots me with a rifle 
---
Yeah the game just CTDed in my silo at the end. I've played a lot but I'm about done with game for a while. Not much to do but run silos and hope you don't crash. Not fun.
---
If you hate the game so much, why are you still frequenting the board about the game?  
---
Their synergy is truly impressive 
---
Can I just shove my laptop into the disc slot on my xbox to get that perk loadout manager?
---
bloody multiplies base and explosive damage. Similar to tse output before nerf.
---
It's an Agility card. In case you're searching for an intelligence card. 
---
--close
---
Bosses aren't always a source of loot. Sometimes they are just a pain in the ass to fight.
---
Yes, I double checked that. I just don't have it
---
Oh i did the same thing but it didn‚Äôt get taken I got that lovely blue screen 
---
This is my thought as well...
---
There's a point where I found the lesson is... 
---
 Stop living for yourself and begin to live for others.  Uplift.  Teach.  Help.  Create something that outlives you each and every logoff.  
---
They could do a whole "Cult of Cthulhu" style questline, give us tentacle masks and batwing oufits. 
---
I've got a totally different approach, that I think would be a lot more fun: [Reclamation Day 2.0: A Modest Proposal for Settlements](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aj84dx/reclamation_day_20_a_modest_proposal_for/)
---
What do you think?
---
i got one a couple days ago looks alot like a classic pilots helm
---
A guy did a video on this. They do not affect the SBQ, the nukes can also fully heal her health without restarting the event timer.
---
So many funny moments in scum, when your mid battle and forgot to empty your butt. Getting killed while pooping sucks, but also hilarious.
---
Actually, you know, you're right.  I've seen some weird-ass mods.  But there was always an equally dark mod... not so much in the atom shop.
---
Will make vendoring a stressful time. The Vendors in game will draw players as you need to buy and sell at some time and you are so vulnerable while looking at the vendor inventory.
---
Vendor camping will be a thing a guarantee it.
---
As long as they separate pve and pvp servers it should be fun having to be on the watch for any player around.
---
Yes the whole pvp thing would be useless if you could see players on the map. Makes situational awareness a moot point is all you had to do was look at the map to see if the coast was clear.
---
Scrapper isn't supposed to work on junk, just weapons and maybe armor. 
---
That's lame
---
PvP lover here. I‚Äôve had really good, fun fights that go beyond the one hit kills of the past since the fireproof + dense elimination of explosive bonus damage. You have to do it out of power armor and really invest in a defensive build but it works and I‚Äôve made friends doing it. Most fun I had in a group I got from fighting this same guy over and over (over multiple days and servers) and eventually becoming friends.
---
This game is clearly not one game. Neither are any other big online games. Some people will explore, some will build, some hoard, some grind for loot, some grind for plans, and some of us enjoy PvP.
---
The reddit population is not representative of the games population. If players choose to ignore PvP and avoid learning about it, the least they could do is promote their own interests in ways that aren‚Äôt just shitting on ours.
---
I love my princess castle bed, I need a unicorn plushie next! 
---
Yeah, because I would love to be in the middle of a fight with 20 ferals surrounding me and my guy stops moving real quick because he‚Äôs about to shit himself. Hell why not make it even more realistic and make running not an option unless you‚Äôre within 20 meters of a toilet, or a nice bush.
---
Because then it would be a Post-Apocaplyptic Sims game!
---
But seriously, while I agree with you that a Molerat Stew would definitely give you a serious case of MudButt, I think it would just be another monotonous thing to do, like "Heck, do I finish crafting this Power Armor or do I build that outhouse with the heated seat..?"
---
Actually, now I want this, too. **Make it happen, Bethesda!!**
---
Good point. Only 3% killed 20 players yet the first major feature they add is a pvp mode that only 3%will use a stay with
---
Ah OK. Because I've never really noticed them shooting anything at me besides that smoke. 
---
Missile launchers are basically only useful as joke weapons. Too heavy, even ammo is absurdly heavy, and doesn‚Äôt do enough damage compared to rifles
---
Idk, after 2 kids that... seems like it would have been a better choice! :P
---
Exactly how much time and resources are being wasted? Is this the only thing they are working on? Exactly what percentage of the dev team is working on this versus bug/stability fixes versus new content?
---
I've found great fun in doing some pvp baiting tactics. Its all solo mind you, I don't have a low level friend tricking people. What I do have is less than 20% health, armor that I take no damage in, and a good sense of humour. I have done things like get around 200-300 cap bounty (nobody can resist, most people will kill you for 10 caps.) And I will server hop going "AFK" at the vendors, Watoga is perfect, since high level people are there alot. Someone walks into the station and the game begins... Typically they will suspect something, so its like fishing, you wait for the bite. As soon as I see the directional damage indicator, I will slowly turn towards them (like the terminator) and blast them point blank with my gauss rifle. Then it's on. Everyone I've tricked with this has lost 1000+ caps to me in attempted revenges. 
---
Another fun PvP oriented activity is getting a bounty, same as above, and hiding out in someone elses camp. Don't destroy anything... Yet. You want someone else thinking it's your camp and blasting you willy nilly. They will immediately recieve a bounty as well, and you are clear to ice them. I had quite a hilarious PvP fight in whitespring (we all hate camps there anyway.) In somebody elses camp. It was me and two other people all trying to kill eachother and this guy, who was nowhere to be seen, was just having his base shredded to shit. I also came out with around 3000 more caps after that scrawl.
---
On the other hand, you can find low level players and maybe mess with them a little, maybe help them, the choice is yours. You can be a weirdo over the mic too. Its amusing as hell. 
---
Other than that, learn all plans, discover and thoroughly explore all locations, launch at least one nuke from each silo (why not?) Also nuking different areas people have been testing. Build a camp to your specifications (you and I both know you still need that keypad door. And your wiring has been fucked since you built it, but you were too lazy to re wire it.) And platinum the game if you haven't.
---
Maybe you shouldn't put your house on the market when it's on fire.
---
yeah I'm getting burned out on this game. I tried changing it up by avoiding fast travel and it made the game a little more interesting.
---
yeah but maybe actually start?
---
 While it is funny, that would just be tedious and lose the humor in about the first hour.
---
Hahahah !!! Tell me about it 
---
PvPer here. I was wrong about PvP in this game and it took leveling my second character to 100 to know this. I‚Äôm excited about PvP and finally being the best raider I can be. I hope Bethesda knows that reddit isn‚Äôt representative of the full population of their game and takes the outcry with a grain of salt.
---
People that haven‚Äôt even *tried* to learn or play PvP and are months away from testing out Survival mode claim to know exactly how it‚Äôs all going to play out...I‚Äôll actually wait to experience it before I pretend to know.
---
A synth thats who
---
Oh damn, might be a bug then, I had the problem where I was only picking perks from the special stat invested each level.
---
You just described the entire game.
---
Nah, I say let em use legendaries. Even let them use their existing characters with all their stuff from adventure mode. But full inventory is dropped on death.
---
Hour or 2 a night after work? While still having the time to spend with wife and child for an appropriate amount of time. I've been on the same time schedule since the beta of this game and I'm a level 236... maybe get good instead of being salty because your trash.
---
Nope, regens her if anything 
---
the red dress thing is realistic, whats voyeuristic aboot it? you got people in game or real life just watching you play? you cant handle looking at a non sexualized thing and making a big deal aboot it? its just a game
---
the always in underwear thing is just poor coding.
---
Rad sponge doesn't take mutations away.
---
I got hella encumbered one night at white springs bunch of people zoned in and died to the rads got like 5 bags that was bunch of springs and other junk. Also a lot of rad suits died too, took those bags as well.
---
Hey could you do me a bow combat armor helmet?
---
Thanks. I saw a chance a chance and took it.
---
Or your dude does shit himself, and gets "vault suit rash" which is going to be -50% move speed, and blurred vision. Accompanied by constant groaning from your character.
---
Realistically that‚Äôs what might actually happen.  So implement adult diapers in the game as a buff for that deep dark brown hour you experience in a cave
---
What weapons are you choosing to use that break so fast, and are so ammo inefficient? 
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, there‚Äôs lots of work to be done on balancing weapons so that they are all worth using... but until they get to that, I choose to use weapons that are durable and efficient, because I understand my choices and consequences.
---
Congrats. My first Wendigo was in my 20s and came from out of nowhere while I was over-encumbered. I won, but there was tons of running and I had no stimpaks left when it was all said and done.
---
Id be spending alot more time at my camp, constantly shitting and just eating stuff
---
Yes!
---
This made me consider the implications of a speech skill 100 build  aka fallout 3 style ending the SBQ fight by kindly asking her to GTFO and wreak havoc elsewhere
---
But they‚Äôre making sure to weaken good weapons, so there‚Äôs that. I haven‚Äôt played 76 in a couple weeks. Been doing red dead exclusively. It‚Äôs so much more satisfying. 
---
Agreed, it's a worrying trend. By the time we get FO5, it will have a Nickelback soundtrack
---
Maybe you should do things other than grinding out irrelevant levels? Being level 236 in a game with a cap at 50 isn't an achievement to brag about.
---
Watching your female character while pooping...
---
I personally am not all that for it. It‚Äôs some dumb question brought in all video games on why can‚Äôt our characters do it. At the end of the day that‚Äôs a thing you have to remember, plus you can‚Äôt get sickass mutations in real life.
---
Or say with the radiation our people have been exposed to then say their is something with their bodies in which they absorb all nutrients now. Therefore no waste products in the end.
---
Take your time and click slowly or you will lose your shit, hell this game with unstable servers and lag anything you do in a menu should be done slow. From selling to crafting and scrapping to events like Mama's, I've learned from experience in having to buy back my items at over inflated prices or scapping my med pump X-01 chest plate right off my character due to lag.
---
They literally said Pve content is coming in the same month
---
Uh, that came off pretty bad. It‚Äôs actually a genuine question, in case you aren‚Äôt aware of the ups and downs of various weapons and and perks. 
---

---
Mattel makes the Plastic Queen, not Fisher Price. :)
---
I believe this is when you have a perk that reduces the crafting materials. From what I can tell it displays the reduced material requirements, but the actual check is against the full material cost and so it fails. Not completely sure if that is what is happening but that's what I have observed.
---
Using foundation blocks will level the floor out, but it requires quite a bit of concrete. 
---
got my first one a few days ago and another tonight... both from dogs in a SBQ fight.
---
Immediately after the bombs fall there is going to be some backlash with your bowels. 
---
I fell asleep playing woke up with no junk. Hehe. I had collected a nice little amount, and all my toys! Gone.
---
I imagine the smell would cause a penalty to stealth too.
---
Agreed, I just rebuilt my CAMP in the exact same place so I could make my floors higher and not have the goddamn weeds in my fucking store. 
---
If you setup camp near a farm type area they spawn along with foxes Brahmin and Radstags
---
Well see that's the thing. I'm not going to doubt you. 
---
I know there are people that do have a shit experience out there. There has to be.
---
But keep in mind there's also people that have relatively minor problems.
---
We can't base it all on what we see first hand alone.
---
I'm not going to pretend everyone is having a swell time, but at the same time, I'm not buying that everyone's having massive problems
---
A faction system like Destiny‚Äôs would be great. People were really loyal to their factions in that game, would be awesome to see the same in 76.
---
Someone notify SGT Major Gutsy, we have a traitor in our midst. 
---
I totally agree. What is sad, at least for me, every time I think of duping, I harken back to my first experience with online games where saving character level and armor was involved. I had been playing Diablo for a while either solo, or on a LAN. I couldn't get online at the time because I only had 56k and couldn't keep a stable connection to battle.net. Finally I was able to set up a shotgun modem on my pc and have almost isdn speeds so I was able to connect. Inget online and people started attacking me in chat about cheating. I didn't know wtf they were talking about. It turns out that the plate armor my gfs friend's boyfriend gave me was duped. It was something like Godly Plate of the Whale, ever since then, I just stayed away from it as much as possible. I even avoided games where it was prevalent. Had I not pre-ordered, I would have not purchased fo76. Especially when I went to Costco tonight and the tricentenial version was 29.99. What a waste of pure potential. 
---
The best course now would be to balance everything over a few weeks. The mistake most developers make is nerfing/buffing a few things at a time and it just becomes a cycle because it doesn‚Äôt work.
---
Haha maybe true, but they expected people to get over 100 at some point, as the "fallout forever" achievement would suggest. 
---
If they wouldve just done it correctly from the beginning, it wouldnt be a bug they wouldve had to fix later (either 3 digit width, or not a fixed width).
---
This is one thing that is so annoying, so easy to fix, but so minor that its probably going to remain at the bottom of the ‚Äùto do list" for eternity.
---
You are not alone. It really bothers me too.
---
I have a tank build
---
Btw if anyone wants to snuff me for this I‚Äôm asleep at Radroach daddy‚Äôs house
---
Oh man up! On many MMO games you lose your entire invent on death, weapons, armour, the lot! So death here is very tame.
---
clearly you dont have the best gear if you are dying. also you prolly wouldnt have got a 3\* item anyways even if you did it wouldnt be something you would have even used.
---
until they make it so a 3\* enemy 100% drops a 3\* item its just a gamble. im tired of killing them only to get 1\* or NO  legendarys whatsoever
---
If you need a bad guy to go after, then sign me up for that.
---
Ooooooh
---
The devs probably thought it would take months or more to hit triple digits. That is something that was most likely back-burnered as an eventual fix sometime, maybe, whatever. 
---
I love it and got it immediately. My camp now has the race car bed and the castle bed.
---
What is your level/perk layout where you are having so much difficulty with a 3 star legendary? 
---
Bethesda should put a lock on the death bags. Picking the lock makes a player wanted, but a player who has killed you in accepted PvP gets a key to it.
---
Should be at the freak show, on a poor doggie that was stolen from a fella at a watchtower. 
---
Showing.. OTHER options.. to ME? I won't allow it.  
---
Mob mentality.

Either they don't get it or pvp scares them
---
I'll try and you tube it for you. It's way beyond a quick flash. It's a prolonged, unrealistic display. When you add it to the "uh, you're naked again lol" after zoning, from my own POV, it's an unreasonable amount of dirty underwear!
---
Kinda hard to get some quality gear when you can't even loot legendaries... and yeah I guess I probably wouldnt have but just being robbed of the opportunity pisses me off
---
That's the best comment ive ever heard
---
Or read i guess
---
Only 64 (low I know, didnt get around to grinding glowing ghouls pre patch) against 3 major gutsys but sentry bot with nades is what screwed me
---
i already know what it looks like my main char is female and i wore the dress for the first 2 weeks. your just getting pissy over something for arguments/attention sake.
---
Not full price and have bought items at the Atom store with atoms earned in game.  For the hours I‚Äôve put in, I‚Äôve gotten my money‚Äôs worth.  If you don‚Äôt like it, purchase a game that makes you happy.   Life‚Äôs too short to lose your shit over $60.  
---
this
---
As I‚Äôve told everyone who has heard that a game is bad or good. Try it for yourself before jumping on a bandwagon. What system are you playing on?
---
&gt; people rarely come back in any serious capacity
---
You know this based on your tons and tons of experience with online Fallout games?
---
They probably level 1000
---
It absolutely SHOULD have taken months.
---
I had an absolute blast at this event!! I got so many plans, ammo (even fuel for my flamethrower!) and even my Mr.Fuzzy outfit from Joker ;)
---

There was so much stuff up for grabs that so many people in these forums are normally after. I donated a BOS Bomber Jacket (I had a spare), T50 Calibrated Shocks (I brought too many), mutation Serums (my super duper perk made some spares), truck loads of rifle ammo (I use heavy weapons so I dont use them) and more. Times that by many people doing the same thing and we had so much stuff to choose from and was all for free.
---
I also walked up the right side of the map with a guy that couldn't fast travel and we took out some scorchbeasts along the way, a couple of us had a guitar jam session and a group of scorched that decided to shoot at the base got the gift of mini nukes after somebody dropped like 30 of them.

The funny thing was the second server we joined was pretty empty so it was mostly us. For the few people left in the server it would have seemed really empty. There was one guy that just had Whitesprings all to themselves. Screenshot of the people left in the rest of map (we were off screen in the top right corner): [https://imgur.com/JVedkjd](https://imgur.com/JVedkjd)
---
I have said many times before the text chat mod had given this game so much more life since I have been using it. Today we had Grahm held at Charlestown and the Responder Bot spawned right next to him and we held them while other people joined the server to check out their inventory, I got powered gate plans, radiation emitter plans and all the clock plans :P
---
Really is a great community of guys on there!
---
Same with me. Soon as I killed a 3* my game crashed and put me into a different server and even a completely different area in the map. Feelzbad.jpg
---
"overinflated" I crash three-five times in a two hour session. I might spent ten-twenty minutes in a two hours session crashing out, re-starting, and getting back into a server...never mind all lost progress, lost junk if I'd just died, etc.   
---
it's not over-inflated. The game's an unstable broken mess. You're just lucky that for some reason, you're not one of the one's having issues. 
---
Ps4
---
I dunno, I am level 78 or 79 and I haven't even completed the main quest yet. 
---
Ok, so now this needs to be added to survival mode.  Nothing like getting griefed dropping a duce!
---
yeah i killed 2 3\* ghouls in a row only for neither of them have any legendary loot. imagine that feeling. now that tse weapons are being nerfed there isnt even any enjoyment in getting legendarys anymore, even my legit 2 shot weapons are gonna be nerfed.(i dont even have a tse weapon but was hoping to find a legit one....now dupers have ruined the game and forced a nerf)
---
Prison Break event has one as a boss.
---
Here's a novel idea. **Don't sell the game for a complete AAA price** if its going to launch in that near abortion of a state.
---
Hard Bargain with Grape Mentats.
---
Works fairly well for me.
---
I only have 2 Charisma.
---
Just for lone wanderer.
---
I thought I had just passed a few crazy players running around in their tighty whiteys. A glitch makes way more sense! I started to notice this about 1 week ago.
---
I'm constantly picking plants for healing salves and noticed a pattern, they degrade into rotted material faster now than two weeks ago. Before, I had to use them before logging off. Today, in less than an hour the soot flowers and bloodleaf began to degrade (about the same time as the massive 3 pm EST server drop). 
---
But did you wear a clown costume? 
---
Yeaaaa, I didnt play Destiny for a reason.
---
Your incentive is there, just not necessarily the right direction.
---
Pick a SPECIAL point, move it, then move it back.  Now do it 14 more times!
---
Still hoping the Blackbird PA scheme comes back this week.  
---
First make the gatling gun sight actually point in the general area of where youre aiming
---
Yeah but that's never happened to me.
---
So my experience is equally as valid as yours.
---
Now thats excellent!
---
yes if you keep switching maps and go to that locker different jackets ill be there
---
My main issue is that the end game is non existent. At this point there is no reason to return to the game, which is really bad for the type of game they were going for.
---
What I don‚Äôt understand is how an MMO can have an endgame. I played ESO for a little over 2 years. There wasn‚Äôt an endgame. I don‚Äôt need an endgame. I get an end of storyline, wander the wastes for FO3/NV/4 but this? Nope. 
---
I found one in my ass!!
---
This bugs the crap out of me more than it should. The problem is that the slanted walls have an overhang, but the full-height and half-height walls do not. Either the overhang needs to be attached to the roof pieces instead of the wall, or have additional wall pieces with an overhang.
---
‚Äúwe're going to get whacky towers of stash boxes and staircases leading to gardens of pip-boy standees.‚Äù
---
Have you...
---
Have you been spying on me? That‚Äôs literally all I ever build in settlements. Like exactly.
---
Shallow storyline with zero way to affect any outcome, decisions do not matter. Extreme lack of basic features which would normally only be acceptable in an alpha state. 
---
I could go on and on, but it really comes down to this game having been cobbled together  from FO4 with later care. 
---
Trust me, it's not bugging you more than you should be, you should be upset by it lol
---
What pvp? Lol
---
All about that bass, no treble - she thicc.
---
Lawhd she comin!
---
There‚Äôs a survival mode? What dying of hunger and thirst while trying to escape 2 guys with sledgehammers isn‚Äôt enough?
---
Ironic.
---
Imo it hasnt been all that great in ever. The last patch seems to have made it much worse. 3* legendary enemies all drop trash 1* s, if anything. 
---
Wooooot.   Ivory grips for the rest of us.
---
I'm all for saying the game has problems. It does.
---
But basing it off only the people that had a bad experience and giving the image that it's unplayable is biased af.
---
You played 5 /6 hours and experienced glitches and 2 server crashes and still thibk theres nothing wrong with it? 
---
You being sarcastic?
---
Yes, This.
---
Why not just spend 5 minutes of your time and pick the damn perks?
---
Agreed.  Energy weapons, particularly lasers, are totally useless, too.
---
This is my opinion as someone who was hyped, pre-ordered, and stopped playing a week after release. It's because the release was atrocious. The invisible enemies, invincible enemies, single enemies stretched out over an entire location, server crashes, and frame rate drops for console. This is all without mentioning the lies from BGS about multiple gameplay elements.
---
That being said, since then the game is much more stable, has much less bugs, and is getting better with every update. In the last few weeks I've been enjoying it again.
---
I Built my camp very glitchily onto the train bridge outside harpers ferry. Only realized there were insane amounts of radiation there afterwards and now I'm too lazy to move. The final kicker is that i haven't gotten one of those radiation removal arches yet so i can't be in my base without power armor or a hazmat suit. If i go out my back door i can get 80 or so rads a second.
---
Me: ‚ÄúCan you just wait until I pull my pants up?‚Äù  
---
Griefer: *Lobs MRIV grenade*
---
 Janitorial role playing staff grumbles in the aftermath
---
That's a really great idea
---
Not really cause the glitches ive faced weren‚Äôt that serious and ive played games with way worse servers
---
Server stability sucks. The game stability sucks too, some days I crash to dashboard more than get disconnected from servers. I'm surprised the fanboys aren't here to tell you it must be on your end because the game/servers are "fine." Always happens to me whenever I bitch about it on this toxic sub.
---
lmao imagine buying aroms for this trash hahahaha half funny have angry shame on you and im serious shame on you supporting that people like you are why we got what we got
---
Good to know!
---
It's because it makes it seem that no one at Bethesda played the game enough to realize this was going to be an issue.
---
The problem may reside in your buikd or your weapons.... or both.
---
Give us a better context.
---
What level are you?
---
Where are you getting these 3 star legendaries?
---
What weapons do you have?
---
What build do you have?
---
I can easily kill 3 star legendary bloated glowing ones with 2 All Rise hits and my build is sniper/ shotgunner with only 4 cards to improve melee which I equip and im down on ammo. Im level 85. 
---
1. How much scrap were you carrying!?
---
2. How did they flag you? Did you own a workshop?
---
Maybe I'm playing the game because I enjoy playing it with friends? And just because the "level cap" ended at level 50 doesnt mean that I didnt still have lots of things to do and see which I still do. Just because your trash and have nobody to play with doesnt mean that others dont soy boy. 
---
Like I said, I have all the perks I want (for the time being), and I dont want a longer deck to sort through to find the cards I need. Id delete some cards if I could
---
Go into the folder and delete it manually. Basic windows feature, highlight the folder and click the delete button. 
---
People really dislike those camps opposite the station as it prevents a rare vendor from spawning. Ultra irritating for people trying to get that vendor to spawn.
---
I **just** broke my habit. Now that I'm pretty settled in my build, I've been unloading a bunch of crap each day to vendors. I still pause when I see a desk fan or a globe though. The urge to horde is still strong! I guess it carries over from Fallout 4. I had grandiose plans for a full town so I used to collect everything I saw.
---
Sufficient people are having issues that they need to _fix_ them. Which is odd, as bethesda's never really done sufficient bug fixing before. 
---
is the plastic queen an actual specific thing? i was just imagining a plastic scorchbeast queen toy
---
Yep. They never fixed all the other normal challenges wither, even though they claimed to last patch. And we are supposed to believe they can track every player inventory accurately to catch dupers when they can't program a simple tracker for challenges? Ok. I believe you Bethesda. /s
---
This is with games in general. One of the people behind Diablo 3 put it best in that if a player leaves happy, they're more likely to come back. Unhappy players have a much less chance of coming back, especially if something better pops up in the meantime.
---
Plus I enjoy the hate mail I get when I kill soy boys like you and take all your stuff :D
---
I would love a reward crate at the end of an event. Something akin to a Government Supply drop box, after an event. 
---
Let me choose my rewards I want. 
---
If your on pc the perk loadout mod does this as well and it‚Äôs pretty nice. 
---
It also helps that there are biweekly streams where we get to see exactly what is being worked on.
---
Can believe OP asked a question like that.
---
&gt;Does anyone else scan over the map and if they see a dot at either Alpha, Bravo, or Charlie, get a little thrill and hang around on the server a few minutes longer to see if a nuke gets launched?
---
Yes! Definitely check after a nuke to see if its a crew doing a trifecta.
---
&gt;and then get disappointed when they check a few minutes later and the dot is gone?)
---
Yeah, what the hell is up with that? DC maybe?
---
Make sure not to open your pipboy until everything has loaded in
---
"You're having never-ending bugs, why should the company decide if bugs are sufficiently addressed by the experience of the people who are suffering from them, instead of those that aren't". 
---
Or to put it another, slightly hyperbolic way "Why should we go to the hospital, I'm not the one who's bleeding out". 
---
Because that's what you're saying, and that's what OP is saying. They should STOP FIXING BUGS and give you NEW CONTENT.  Which is stupid, because of COURSE they're working on new content, they've stated that repeatedly. 
---
But of COURSE they should continue to fix the _laundry list_ of bugs in this game. Like, go to the monorail elevator and try to take the lift. It's broken. It's broken, as far as I can tell, for _everyone_. But nah fuck it, all that area should be left accessible forever because the game's "good enough". 
---
ended up doing that.. just trying to point out the ridiculousness of this still being a thing.
---
It's a 'feature'. - Todd Howard.
---
Amen, brother/sister.
---
Plus I enjoy the hate mail I get when I kill soy boys like you and take all they're stuff :D
---
You just need to remove everything above the stairs and touching them, then they can be repositioned.
---
I see. Well, the thing with fallout 76 is that its coming from one of biggest game studios in thr world and people have little tolerance towards these issues.
---
The game overall has been improved in termsbof glitches and bugs, but server stability is getting worse.
---
The game is lack luster in terms of content, and if you play it the normal (missions &amp; exploration) around level 70 you'll yourself with nothing to do except mindless farming.
---
Focusing on a survival pvp mode wasnt exactly what people were asking for either. Yet they're forcing players to pvp, and no onr understands why.
---
All this and a lot more has given bethesda very low credibility. Thats the thing.
---
Personally, I think fallout 76 is ok but still needs lots of improvements and mostly a lot more content.
---
Nope. At least not all the walls, floors, decor etc. I don‚Äôt know if any other structure that could be hindering it
---
Speak for yourself, I have an anti armor tracking quad missile launcher I use for ~~AC-130s~~ scorchbeasts until they land. It breaks after 1-2 fights but it's a nice way to offload rockets and it's one of the few weapons that can really do damage in that scenario
---
This just happened right now. The nuke was two minutes in and I only got to kill two glowing ones and I got the blue screen of death. I jumped back in to where a buddy was and luckily enough was back in the nuke zone. And then the same damn thing happened again!!!  This time I was not so lucky to get back on the same server and am now hopping through lives like Sam Beckett trying to get back to where I was. 
---
&gt; I wanted to complain
---
Xbox :(
---
Performance issues aside (based on posts ive seen), you pc players sure do have some sweet qol benefits with those mods
---
I will level any house around the Charlestown vendor bot spawn. And you can have the caps as they're ultra easy to get. Lol. 
---
How would u know?
---
I think AA only applies to the ballistic damage, so the explosive part is unmodified. Even something like Mutant's Explosive is probably slightly better at the moment, assuming that explosive damage is effective on the target.
---
I love Fo76 and fully intend to come back when there's more content. So do the 3 other people I play with. As usual, this weird, "Fo76 is a failure and nobody bought it and if they bought it they hated it and if they liked it they stopped playing and if they stopped playing they're gone foreeevvvverrrr!" thing clashes with reality.
---
Also, even if I quit playing this instant, I still got over 200 hours from it and I still think it's better than Fallout 3 or 4. I've had a nuclear blast playing it and I think it's the best thing Bethesda has put out in a while. (And I like nearly everything they put out)
---
exactly. No other game ive ever played has this particular "feature".
---
Thanx for letting me know üëç
---
All you literally have to do is play 2-3 hours a day, which is slightly below average for a lot of people. Average is probably 4. 2-3 hours a day for the sake of your own entertainment really isn't that long at all. For many people, gaming is more of a hobby than just entertainment, so they may spend more hours per day on it than others, unlike you apparently. You can get a ton of levels just by grinding for legendary weapons too. Getting xp while doing that is just a side effect, and until recently the glowing ghouls at whitesprings during a nuke could very easily rake you in 4-6 levels within an hour or less. It really doesn't take THAT long to get to just level 100, especially over 2 and a half months. Plenty of people have perfectly functional and health lives while playing 4-6 hours a day. You honestly sound envious of those kind of people if you're immediately going to call them losers. God forbid people put time into something they enjoy.
---
right? what a jerk!
---
Bruh, that Infinite experience glitch before they fixed it
---
Agree. This us the only online game I have played  that doesn't share the exp when in a group. Its super annoying. Please fix.
---
Have you even looked at the weapon balance for 76? Energy weapons are made out of paper mache compared to equivalent damage guns and melee builds might as well be goddamn gods with how much damage per hit they dish out. And the loot is shit because most legendary effects are quite crap just like 4, only usuable in very specific situations with a few being so good they outclass everything.
---
And my bow
---
The RNG is complete garbage. You can farm for dozens of hours and not find/receive what you want need. People are only willing to bang their heads against a wall for so long before they quit. 
---
What do you mean TSE can be countered? I‚Äôm lvl 100+ in full ultracite power armor and still get 1 shotted by those things. If I am walking down the street and someone smacked my workshop and then comes looking for me I might not even know that they‚Äôve been flagged for pvp by the time I‚Äôve been blown away and looted. üò≠ I‚Äôm dead.
---
You could pick out and level perks in a category you don't really use. I have perception at 3 and don't change perks there often. You could spend a lot of your points that way. You could also make multiple versions of the same card in that same category. It's less of a hassle for just one category to be a clusterfuck.
---
Maybe we could get weapon display cases that would take up camp budget instead of stash wiyj all weapon types taking up an equal amount of camp. Even if they hogged budget as bad as turrets we could keep some fun legendary heavy weapon for later 
---
I agree. Would also kill for pink power armor and a pink pip-boy! I love girly shit like that. Especially in a world where it clearly is out of place. Somehow that makes it better for me. 
---
Im with the others, id say theres more coming. 
---
If its bugged- I played in the beta, and I know theres a few achievements ( like leaving the vault ) didnt transfer, so maybe that could have something to do with it. if theres someone who didnt participate in the beta or created an alt that could confirm one way or the other...
---
The anti-armor effect in general is good against scrochbeasts. It wouldn't be that great without it.
---
Sence 
---
People hate this game because they are the wrong audience. 90% of the playerbase are pure singleplayer fans who came to this game thinking it will be a Fallout 5 singleplayer story driven co-op game. This game was designed to cater to a  lower audience, Bethesda just took the Fallout 4 engine and wanted to give multiplayer fans something to also enjoy until they release Fallout 5 to singlellayer fans. But the massive anti-pvp lashout it got frkm the wrong audience at start made them release it with non existing-pvp for a bigger potential market nog pleasing anyone with the game. Combined thst with the massive amount of bugs and technicsl issues the game launched made everyone trash on it. But Bethesda patch by patch fixed their mistske. Now in about 2 weeks we will get pvp servers with no restrictions. The game can finally cater to the multiplayer audience. The 90% singleplayer fans will never be pleased until Bethesda transforms this game into Fallout 5. They don't have patience for that game to come out so they will continue to trash this game just to teach Bethesda a lesson to never cater to multiplayer fans again.
---
Can you get the camp jumpsuit from it?
---
Yes, this is the reason why my buddy and I stopped playing and I'm sure why most people stopped playing. It feels really shitty when you pay 60 dollars for a game that has this many performance issues. Please fix the base game first before you add a new mode. 
---
fuck me for wanting to uninstall a program through the uninstaller.  
---
this is the problem if you try to open your pipboy too early then forget about it only option at that point is to leave server 
---
I see that to enjoy Fo76 I need to stay away from this toxic reddit. Thanks Community!
---
You also can't zoom all the way out on the map, which is a minor personal annoyance
---
**Jon** - "Hey Bill, what about if anyone ever gets above level 99, the boxes aren't big enough for 3 digits"
---
**Bill** - "Jon, there you go again with your crazy ideas. Stop with all that and get back to the Atom Shop programming room" 
---
Trying to get those metal house plans and powered doors. Ran into Graham multiple times and when I check Watoga the vendor bot never has them. Oh well.
---
Its 60/h between all your purifiers, not per purifier which is why stacking purifiers is a waste of resources. Of course the game left us all to find this out the hard way.
---
Drop site V9 will be outside the blast zone 
---
So what would be the best way of getting purified water then.
---
Thank you for including basic UI functionality and common sense.  Thank you so much.  This game is so great.  You are trying so hard.  Don't go F2P!  More Atom Shop skins for one type of item please!  Don't let me scrap mods! To the level 38 player that ...
---
No. Dont bother.
---
The sad part is that one, and one that makes your friends green on the map instead of yellow are in my opinion the best ones and they really are so simple and help so much
---
Agreed
---
I love it. A little heavy with the posters, but I'd love to live here :) great job
---
Your guess is as good as mine, for what it's worth I'm up to my eyeballs in radaway so I've  just accepted the radpoisoning.  Outside of that it's either looting it or taking from other peoples purifiers.
---
Maybe a purifier and smaller purifier wont share the same resource timer? I dunno.
---
Sorry I can't be of more help.
---
You are supposed to be very happy about a perk card working the way it should've worked.  And you should be FUCKING PUMPED about the super amazing hard working folks at Bethesda preserving the genre of launched-too-early alpha games finally including basic UI functionality telling you about things you already have so you don't purchase more.
---
I don't like using the exact same weapon for the entirety of the game. Also, you end up getting weapons with legendary effects that are actually decent or good and aren't something you should get rid of. i can certainly let go of things, but you really can't keep all that much stuff in your stash at all.
---
Edit: meant to reply, made a new post like an idiot.
---
Oh dear god yes. This annoys the shit out of me 
---
Remember Diablo 1 and The Butcher? I had a buddy call me up at 3am on a weekday going "DUDE you have to come online and help me, I died at the butcher and if I can't get my gear back it's GONE" 
---
Is this a... what day is this?
---
Today there were several running around claiming all the workshops on the map with one-hit-kill guns. It was neat teaming up with other players until we realized the only way to kill them was by abusing the terrible server lag.
---
That‚Äôs a main feature of survival mode that was announced 
---
I can agree with the fact that bethesda shouldve fixed most of the bugs and glitches before the release and also if the fans didn‚Äôt ask for pvp to not insist on it but what other kind of content do people expect other than missions and exploration.
---
Just target the four thrusters. Once you cripple them all, it lowers down and just hovers a few feet off the ground. I make pretty short work of them with just a anti armor .44 (with no pistol perks on). A sniper build with access to an armor penetration perk should have no trouble.
---
I usually make the "?!" emote when low lvls try to murder me :D
---
I just did the Patrol Duty at the Penitentiary and got the plans first time doing it.  I thought I read somewhere that it‚Äôs a sure thing.  I am @lvl 59, and have been going to all the merchants multiple times a day to max out caps and look for the homemade plans for the last week and a half.  The only thing I ever saw was the radium plans and never knew to look for the homemade when I was lower level.  Not sure if the level cut off rumors are correct but I‚Äôll probably see it I love the place now that I have it. 
---
Yeah, but I guess I have a tough time breaking the habit of hoarding everything that a has no downside to doing so (which the fallout series has conditioned me oh so well). Im doing pretty good on inventory management now, finally broke that habit lol!
---
Having 1 unspent point is the same annoyance as having 30, and id like to keep some in the bank if I stumble across some new ideas on how to tweak my build.
---
Since they nerfed drops theyve been shitty 1 or 2 stars from 3 star enemies. And most notably if you are in a team it tends to split the star value between ppl. 
---
If you gotta team of 4 1 guy could get a 2 or 3 star, but everyone else will get 1 star. 
---
Or sometimes one of the 4 of you gets nothing. The lucky one gets a 2 star and the other 2 get 1 stars maybe. Something in their shit is broke because you are a million times more likely to get 3 stars if you are the only player around and you solo kill a 3 star. Also high luck helps
---
I'd rather have less immersion breaking numbers on screen personally.
---
How the heck are we supposed to know?
---
What did you do?
---
There is a water filter to be found and you have to create it in the cooking station I believe if you get the plans. After that you can make your own purified water apparently.
---
I need to get me some bleachwood to make the filter so I am not sure how it all works but I think it is a way to make it myself. 
---
You can Google Plans for the filter I believe they are somewhere in the Crafton area in a scout camp. 
---
Hope this helps a bit or maybe someone else can go in detail about it better then me.
---
Before the second patch not including the day one patch is when this all started to have nerfed trash drops
---
Are you using any mods? I'm around 250 hours and I just lost a explosive shotgun. I'm afraid to use any powerful weapons now. 
---
They're pretty uncommon, but you can hear them clucking away when they're nearby.  I feel bad for them in their sorry state.  They're harmless, so I just leave them alone.
---
I've never been at a hunger or anger rate where I have to eat every fucking chicken in a room.
---
I really hate games that make you run from NPC to NPC just to hold you in place while they tell you a story. I can watch youtube if i want to sit still. I unninstalled Fallout 4 the milisecond the main story was over because there was nothing to do after that. Multiplayers are not designed for a singleplayer story were you are the center of the univers. They are more focused on exploration and an enviromental story telling. They are about a sandbox where you make your own fun through survival and roleplay.
---
People definitely carry more than what they really need, but at the same time, when you do need something, it's really annoying to have to go out and actively seek it. Due to not carrying more than you need (not by an insane degree), you're going to have to constantly go through what you need and replenish it later. You have to do that less  frequently if you carry more. I'd rather just get things passively and just carry it on me once I need it. What sucks is that you can have reasonable amount of stuff and still be over encumbered. Shit in this game just weighs to damn much in general, specifically weapons.
---
I was disappointed when I first fought a wendigo. Killed it in 5 hits. It didn't get harder after that. Only easier. FeelsBad. 
---
I'm level 25 and I've probably played 16-20 hours.... 
---
Likely a duper with 1000s worth of shit in their stash from before patch
---
Lmao. Imagine someone who bought this game on release and saying ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs gonna get better, guys!‚Äù... the amount of complete delusion and sunk market cost at work...
---
Killed a Wendigo after it jumped off a cliff following me. Still a win for me. 
---
You're pretty much screwed then if you want to hold onto them :(
---
Who knows? Maybe they introduce that change... in 2 months...
---
Glad Bethesda wasn't in charge of the Y2K changeover. 
---
They are guaranteed spawns at the BBQ shack a little east of top of the world. 
---
Apparently not but go to your kennel. 
---
Cue the "Bethesda, we need breed-able farm animals for our camp!!!" posts.
---
"I have a rare weapon thats better than all the others; I think common weapons should be just as good"
---
This post
---
You just stop it right now sir! Im already jealous of the perk loadouts and known plans (lets see how bethesda breaks their version in the next patch lol), I dont need to know anymore! My gaming pc is only ... 15 years behind the times, so getting that windows xp dinosaur back into fighting shape is out of the question
---
They're an uncommon spawn at Flatwoods. A few tries of server hoping there and eventually you'll hear clucking. Molerats, mongrals, and chickens have a chance of spawning there at the spawn point. Radstages may also spawn there.
---
4 k caps 
---
I was wearing all combat armor and you need to press y or what ever button you use to call for help to actually use the life saving perk also I never said it was good for pve only pvp because it  requires you to take so much damage that you would die in one shot in order for the glitch to activate and make you tank so it's only good against actual player's
---
You have one for 4K? What‚Äôs your GT?
---
I‚Äôve killed 4 3* legendarys in a row on didn‚Äôt servers and they dropped nothing but there regular loot, which was highly disappointing to me
---
Usually what I do is make a few medium ones at my camp, that way they all still fill their storage, then I usually go and claim a few workshops and just throw down water purifiers at each and collect periodically.  I usually can get a few hundred in a couple hours give or take. I have some posts on the whole water storage thing, I think they'd be helpful. 
---
Answer unclear; ask again later.
---
Yes. I killed the scorchbeast queen and got 3 Stimpacks
---
Banana. 
---
I think mine did less
---
Because level 50 is the max level of course!
---
(Yes, I'm being sarcastic) 
---
+karma
---
I think it‚Äôs bugged. I used it before the last patch and it worked fine.
---
Thanks to everyone that showed!
---
Hahahahahahaha you got banned.
---
But seriously 
---
Hahahahahahahahahahaha
---
I don't even think we need a different server for it. Just make it so that in pacifist you don't take slap damage and can't have your camp messed with by other players without engaging them first. 
---
Then PvP gets enabled when you claim workshops, because it's a main factor with workshops.
---
Oh man you will be so dissapointed with that water purifier filter. It breaks after 1 use so you only get to craft 1 purified water with it. The water filter is basically a crafting material for just 1 purified water. And it takes an insane amount of limited materials to craft.
---
For what purpose, get multiple purifiers so they can store more. I have 5 of those which are on the ground. Every time I go to my camp I collect them. I still have plenty left which I sell to vendors.
---
Unless you have anti armor or two shot effect yea there utterly worthless.
---
Damn you scary
---
Beware the ledgendary chicken it terrifyingly cute
---
You replied to the post, not to TSE guy.
---
Messaging back 
---
I've been asking the same question. Don't get me wrong, it's the weakest entry in the franchise, hands down, but it's a solid six or seven out of ten. Ask the internet at large, though, and you'd think it was the unholy lovechild of Satan and Hitler. 
---
You forgot one thing... there is a shitloads of assholes out there. Most nice people but too many assholes
---
Could just be something they forgot to remove when they started porting the Fallout 4 loot lists.
---
What are you talking about??? Overwatch is one of the most polished games out there.  Any game with that sort of meta will be constantly balancing characters throughout the games existence (thankfully) Look at league of legends for example.  Also... I can honestly say I cannot remember a single time where Overwatch crashed out on me.  Poor comparison. 
---
With a life &amp; some pussheey 
---
I know what you mean, its so annoying
---
How do I basic computing
---
Damn I thought I just had if after crafting it. I already wondered why I would craft it at the cooking station lol.
---
Damn, thanks for this info :).
---
Broadsider as well.
---
I have an anti armor broadsider, still does less damage than a black powder pistol.
---
I can confirm this.
---
Lmao! 
---
&gt;mmo
---
&gt;we need to do something about griefers
---
Lmfaoo^oo^oo^oooooi
---
Each jndustrial water purifier can hold up to 5 purified water so if you build 12 of them you will get 60/h across them. The production may be the same regardless how many you build but having more will let them pile up so you don't pick them up as often.
---
I forgot one time, and lost my first good mutation. It never comes off now. Never ever.
---
Cyberbullying is a criminal offense and also false under electronic harrassment. Just saying. 
---
Where is that exactly? I lost my gourd and can't find the hornwright on my map
---
the chickens were what inspired me to make a KFC in game lol. even made my character look like the colonel
---
Feed the people, when loading the ingredients, the lag in updating your inventory means people are hitting "transfer" on their kit rather than the stuff they want to.
---
Pity. I think they missed a trick there. Hell, you could even make it an achievement: Kill the Scorch Beast Queen with an ICBM, 150 ATOM Points!
---
When you reach end game your gonna be collecting a bunch of legendary weapons.
---
Because the bad comes with the good, unless you want some ‚Äúsafe space‚Äù where you never hear anything ‚Äúbad‚Äù.
---
Speaking of player levels, my comment doesn‚Äôt need its own thread so I‚Äôll ask it here.
---
How does scaling work? I already figured out the hard way that there‚Äôs some pretty high level shit compared to me (23) especially along the right margin of the map. But my brother was teamed up, and he was level 7 and pulling the same level enemies.
---
Also, has anyone noticed that if you clear a town and come back, the enemies may be completely different as well as significantly higher level? Like not scaled to your level - but much higher.
---
Example; I cleared Harper‚Äôs Ferry of scorched leveled in their 30‚Äôs or so. Came back and there were Super Mutants in their 60‚Äôs and I‚Äôd only added a couple levels myself 
---
Bro, you can‚Äôt reason with fan-bois 
---
It is. Extremely lazy on Bethesda's part.
---
Make that statement a post so that Bethesda MIGHT read it.
---
Couldn't have said it better myself.
---
You can also craft it at the alchemy station needing slightly different materials. I crafter both versions to see if one of them isn't 1 use but both versions are. You can test for yourself, you can get the white wood sapling part from the top left part of the map near the crocodile. The sapling grows on small white trees. But be carefull because it scraps into wood iv you hit the scrap all button.
---
Yeah.. no.
---
42
---
PREACH MY FELLOW AMMO DROPPING SUFFERER
---
And when you reach end game... what the hell else is there to do other than start collecting stuff...
---
Bethesda knows that. Them blaming pvp complaints is just lying corporate speak. The real reason for nerfing tse is to wrench the economy out of the hands of dupers. Once tse becomes worthless itll strike a major blow to one of the dupers greatest commodities and maybe then bethesda wont have to work so hard chasing duping solutions every patch. It sucks but thats the only reason that makes sense to me
---
Is it one of those pointy walls? Those things can be supported by stairs even if they're sitting on another wall. A roof can also cause this even if it's not technically attached. If you have any of those "stair" pillar things just do yourself a favor and get rid of them. They're *always* fucky. 
---
We don't
---
LOL.  It's too bad we can't make interesting concoctions with pork n beans.  Throw some possum bacon in there or squirrel bits and you've got a hearty campfire meal.
---
We need perk profiles. 
---
Because I still come here every few weeks to see if there are any meaningful updates or content.
---
It would be a lot better if you can‚Äôt see where the nuke will land until it has already. It means that:
---
1) There is that suspense as to where it will land, as well as everyone scrambling for the nuke loo
---
2) Afterwards, it will make a complete battleground, since everyone will come AND everyone will be able to kill each other!
---
Bc then they can‚Äôt sell you gold plated skins 
---
Lol the cook spot
---
I started just before Christmas, am level 74.   IDK what the good drop rate was before then but they still happen.  Usually it's something you don't want or need, so gotta keep grinding.
---
 The Whitespring seems messed up as I get legendary stuff from diseased ghouls and sometimes get nothing but junk from legendary enemies.  Doesn't matter if it's nuked or not.  I got a 3 star harpoon gun 1 other 3 I didn't want today out of probably 50 legendary drops there.
---
I got 2 3 stars out of probably 20 Watoga bots, but much less xp.  
---
They still drop, doesn't seem unreasonable to me.  Gotta get lucky.
---
&gt; give me glass walls and a roof,
---
It's especially frustrating since obviously the files for those types of walls and roofs exist in the game; you can see them on any greenhouse structure, starting with the Vault-Tec agrigultural center in Flatwoods. I just want them to be made available to us the way they were in Fallout 4. 
---
Don't forget about all those slooty underwear mods! 
---
I found that since you can't even sell them, I was just dumping them on the rare occasions I picked them up. They're pointless. 
---
Can you try to repair the game? I had a crash yesterday on PC but it is not common.
---
Perfect for artillery bombardment!
---
People arent saying that. It's that players are leaving disatisfied with the lack of a roadmap and shit endgame, meaning later on its very unlikely they'll return even when content hits because they'll have another game (likely better) on hand.
---
That's the basis of Diablo loot system. Keep players more or less happy so they come back. 4 and 76 swerve into some of the crappiest loot systems i've ever seen.
---
Do the repair/craft/scrap/mod Atom challenges and you are always in need of the mats. When you do one challenge it usually opens another. Before the patch (repair costs altered) I used around ~5000 adhesive for the challenges.
---
I thought I was bad. I have a couple hundred left after giving 50 to my spouse and another 50 to a nice couple I saw setting up their homestead. 
---
I love going out scavenging and exploring. I think I have about 100 lbs of weapons, armor, and aid items in my stash, and the rest is scrap. My spouse doesn't enjoy it as much, he's more combat focused and he likes to dress up in pretty dresses, so I give him scrap and clothing in exchange for legendaries, which I either mod for my own use or sell for caps.
---
We built two sets of excavator PA for the Miner Miracles quest with stuff I had lying around. I think we needed about a dozen springs for his last piece, but a quick trip through Arktos took care of that. It was pretty cool. 
---
Yeah, I hear you. A target with a huge surface area like a mirelurk queen has a lot of flesh that can be injured. Hitting her square-on with a mini-nuke means that she's getting wounded all over a very large area; much larger than a smaller target. So while obviously those big targets also have commensurately larger amounts of health overall, they should be more vulnerable to attacks with larger areas of effect. 
---
Better dead than red.
---
I'm a slow learner.
---
The ghouls at Whitesprings used to give insane xp during a nuke event. I went there at level 39 and went up 4 levels in 10 minutes. I'm level 123 now. I play everyday but usually just go up on level each day now. Yesterday I found someone that was level 998.
---
Something like this would get me to play again. I'm just so damn bored when I play after hitting lvl65+. I'm excited to try the new survival mode(as long as it's new characters only) cause the only time I'm really having fun is in PvP.  I just have almost nothing to look forward to in playing anymore......finally feeling the disappointment everybody was bitching about on release. 
---
What I do is check the list of players in my world before going into the blast zone. That way if I crash, I can go to recent players, find them and join the game to get back on the server again. I'll memorize about 3 names to ensure this. 
---
Artillery bombardment from workshops is how we do that with style
---
I agree with the op
---
but it's not dirt, so the aesthetic changes. I just want to make flat ground I can put a fence around.
---
Your reasoning probably being that there will be OP characters, but there currently already are. That won‚Äôt ever change. There will always be an imbalance of power and skill, it‚Äôs just a reality of online gaming. But you have to understand where I‚Äôm coming from too...I feel like I‚Äôm being punished for playing from day one, leveling up and having a powerful character. Which I won‚Äôt potentially be able to use in this new and more exciting survival mode. 
---
Artillery bombardments from workshops is how we do that with style 
---
&gt; People arent saying that.
---
Then repeats what I said. Nice.
---
They already said you can bring your old character. You will constantly switch between the pvp and pve server because nobody will be able to kill the scorchqueen on the PvE server. It will be a bloodbath if you try. People with new characters will never even finish that quest unless they swich to pve server.
---
Ha ha the first thought I had was MINE MINE MINE from finding Nemo
---
Yeah, I did that when two players randomly started attacking me although they were close to my level. I took them out quite easily.
---
#OWLS?
---
^is ^this ^getting ^old ^yet
---
Any chance you've got a Field Scribe's hat to trade for it? :D
---
I decided to put my camp on top of the mountain they are at, great view of the mire
---
I kinda stuck in the same spot. After I got my platinum I didn‚Äôt really have any motivation to do anything else. The only things I have left are daily challenges and events, and grinding materials that I basically just giveaway all the time. 
---
I spared all but one after I found how useless chicken noodle soup is
---
You guys are idiots...ACTUALLY READ IT... YOU CAN use your existing characters. It it flows between both PVE and PVP. 
---
Are you sure Luck has an effect?  It makes sense of course, and it makes me want to keep my points in Luck.  
---
The team thing seems like a mirage to me.  I play solo and get a 3 star drop from 1 out of 5 3 stars I take down.  It's not as if a 3 is guaranteed to drop anything great.  
---
Appreciate the clarification but you really need to work on your social skills. Wasn‚Äôt privy to this piece of info. Thanks. 
---
Uh..I think you got hit by the stupid branch when you fell out of the tree...you can bring your character(s)  
---
&gt; You‚Äôre free to create new characters for Survival mode, and encouraged to do so, **but you can also use your existing ones**.  
---
  
---
Here is the important paragraph you missed:   
---
 You‚Äôre free to create new characters for Survival mode, and encouraged to do so, but you can also use your existing ones. If you do take on Survival mode with an existing character, keep in mind that all your progress from Adventure mode will travel with you, and anything that affects your character in one game mode will also affect them in the other. This means that if you fire off all your ammo, level up, complete a quest, spend Caps, or find a fancy new weapon in Survival, this will also be reflected on that character in Adventure. If you‚Äôd rather keep your existing characters as they are, we recommend starting a new one when you head into the more challenging Survival mode. 
---
I'm level 160 and just took off starched genes for the first time since lvl 42 when it unlocks. I switched to thru hiker 3 instead and walk around with around 20 nuka grapes and avoid rad showers like the plague. With the market issues and crazy low prices on the market serums are super cheap (I can craft my own) and you can buy nuka grapes for less than 1 cap each so you can essentially do this for free or even turn a profit. With thru hiker at 3, 20 nukas only takes up 2 lbs so it's really not that bad. I'm loving it so far. Been using for about a week and only lost a mutation once by going into my radshower accidentally while building a new camp. My 2 cents.
---
Then actually read the vault news instead of posting a whine on reddit about something you clearly didn‚Äôt take the time to research 
---
O damn thanks. I was gathering all that "dog bleach wood" and when I scrapped all my stuff I just couldn't find it. That is the reason I still didn't make the filter lol. Thanks :).
---
Are you on console or pc? I'm on pc and have had high levels run up on me right outside of flatwood and start attacking. Straight out of the vault I had a level 60 run up on me with a knife and keep trying to jump in front of my bullets. Idk how to server hop but I shouldn't have to cut my game time down because people are dbags.
---
That's really cool. You come across like a super happy old man just ecstatic to have a visitor. 
---
Absolutely 
---
I actually started a new character and plan to play with no weight reduction perks.  Should free up my perk slots and I don‚Äôt feel like I need to carry anything but the basics.  My main is the pack rat.
---
Read the comments in thread like this.
---
Please don't make Bethesda fix it, it's the good thing i have in my life right now.
---
&gt;The last patch seems to have made it much worse. 3\* legendary enemies all drop trash 1\* s, if anything.
---
This is what I'm talking about.  This is really rampant now in fact.  Three- star enemies in high- level endgame areas like cranberry bog and watoga dropping 1 star level 30 stuff in a level 50 area of the map.
---
I could agree with moving it to charisma, but Intelligence already has two massively useful perks, each taking 5 levels. Intelligence really doesn't need any more useful perks to choose between.
---
Anyone else get EXTREME server lag when and only when replacing mainframe cores in the missile silos?
---

I really enjoyed Andrew W.K. as Redeye in Nuka World DLC.  While I would love to hear Grahm's ramblings more often, I think they could easily make an equally beloved radio DJ as an update to the general rock n roll playlist by investing in some cool talent.  Nick Offerman would be hysterical as a Free Stater offering advice to survivors, although I'd expect his going rate is probably too high even for a AAA game studio.
---
You on PC and uning/used mods? I bet that's you problem. Long time known problem, you should check nexus for the 'fix'
---
I‚Äôm talking about certain players demanding that PvP start fresh. I didn‚Äôt know that Bethesda officially responded to these concerns. Why are you being such a asshole guy? This is a forum where people post there opinions in an attempt to engage in a dialogue. Get used to it. 
---
I hope the same. I come from fallout 1 and 2, so I‚Äôm holding out the hope the gauss rifle will be my primary end game. I‚Äôm also under the belief fo76 will be at its best in 2020. 2019 will be growing pains.
---
Takes longer to level in 76 than it did in 4.
---
Would like more mods for melee weapons honestly 
---
Am I stilled banned?
---
If you are running a dedicated heavy/explosive character it weighs 4 pounds and does solid damage. Just because it's not good for YOUR build doesn't mean its useless
---
Tray Stuck: Dick Instructions In Unclear Disc
---
Hahha my bad i copied it from a notepad. Not sure why you think its paid :D
---
Sure that's a great excuse for piss-poor end-game in the meantime...... I didn't expect DLCs by now, but I did still expect to be enjoying playing the game, which I'm not. None of my mates are either. So I'm not playing it, that is exactly my problem with the game, I would rather play the Fallout 4 base game.  
---
And it's not exactly a "new mode". It's still the same survival mechanics but with pvp enabled instead of slap mechanics. I see why some people might like it, but it's not new content and I do not believe the majority of the player base cares about pvp. I'm pretty sure server/client stability is more important than making pvp more prominent for the health of a gaming community.  
---
Aside from the SUPER annoying bugs and dcs during leveling/story which I generally enjoyed the end-game and building/camp mechanics and slapped on dailies/events (for me) is a massive let down in my opinion and needs work asap.
---
If I tell you will you know?
---
Do you not read my post? Then insult me? I‚Äôm talking about players demanding that they start fresh. I‚Äôm concerned that the company will take these opinions seriously which is why I posted my opinion about it. Since when did this sub turn so toxic? Can the moderators do something about responses like this that are clearly insults? 
---
I use the race car bed as a prop on top of my Red Rocket themed base.
---
I run a heavy explosive character. Not sacrificing any damage and can still run bear arms. Stop complaining 
---
I was thinking about making my end game into just building on Workshops so other players can have something to use when I log off. But not sure the official duration of things built in workshops when you log off.
---
D:
---
I wish I had some gold. I use it so fast
---
Lol I wasn‚Äôt even as rude as MrE78 lol but whatever floats your boat bud. If you didn‚Äôt want someone to call you out, you should have done your research first.

Don‚Äôt use your pipboy till everything is fully loaded

Game controls not working. I can pull up the map, use the wheel to eat and drink. No weapons can't move or look around.. Help!
---
You don‚Äôt get to decide what rude is and it isn‚Äôt relative to someone else‚Äôs behavior. Take responsibility for your own immaturity bro. 
---
No. Write in a letter 
---
There you have your dialogue lol I bid you adieu 
---
I try to give things away. It doesn't really work though.
---
Cant say I have. but do basics like restarting the game and if that doesn't work restart your console.
---
Well now its working after 4 logins...please fix this game
---
I love it and would welcome more of it. My princess castle bed is a security blanket of time gone comforts for my character.
---
I may have missed it. But what is the goal of this idea? What is it trying to accomplish?
---
We already have dogs. In order for a dog to become your permanent pet you need 6 points in charisma to max out animal whisperer and wasteland perk. Then you need to find a lone dog that is a random encounter (search location spawn on google) and aim your gun at him to tame it. After that you escort it to your base and if it reaches it alive it will be yours forever. Other players can't kill it and if jt dies from enemies it will just respawn next time you log in. Usually creatures you tame and send to your camp will also defend it from intruders but unfortunetly the dog is from the non-agresive list of animsls you can tame so it will just sit there looking cute.
---
That'll be 800 Atoms in a few months. Scrap it for 2 plastic and 1 lead.
---
I believe this post was to address the opposite views that been heavy on this forum and youtube lately about this survivor mode.
---
Wait, you can sell legendary weapon to vendor
---
üò¢üò¢üò¢
---
It's two parts, I brainstorm an idea of how to make player vendors work, and secondly bring up an idea that someone previously brought up (players combining their camps to make a 'town'), with my own ideas behind it since theirs focused on stable permanent servers and that doesn't work in my opinion.
---
&gt; a few bugs
---
Maybe by Bethesda standards...
---
Are second account mules 100% allowed? Not sure what Bethesda stance is on this, i'm a hoarder too and i hate the stash limit.
---
This so sooo cute!
---
It does. Some how a buddy of mine has a luck stack glitch bethesda hasnt ben able to fix. Its on their end and permenent. He has over cap by alot and gets 1 stars from normal enemys and 3 stars all the time
---
Melee so OP, I once swung my weapon and the server crashed.   Nerf now!!
---
In Sweden that's not equality giving both genders one item each. Here we only use one item working with both genders. Our country is a bit pathetic I know
---
Giddyup Buttercups with My Little Pony paint schemes coming to a shop near you!
---
I'd mainly like to see lots of the perks that are in the "pop this in for 3 seconds and then remove it." changed where they don't take up a SPECIAL slot.
---
Currently I see people that have master lockpicking and don't bother because it's more annoying to change out perks/ switch back than they think the hassle is worth.
---
I'd keep weight perks as is since that is actual a tactical choice.  Short list off the top of my head.
---
Lockpicking, Hacking, Crafting, CAMP buff perks (Ever met anyone who changes over to the perk to lower hunger rate in camp?)
---
It's most likely an incomplete list, but basically if it's something 99% of people don't feel the need to equip outside the 3 seconds its used.
---
Y2K all over again
---
Yes 
---
Neither, I think it's as long as that server is active. 
---
That looks painful.
---
Aw, I bet there's other good things than a random flash of avatar briefs. And if you hate your job, PM me. I'm great with resumes. Need your resume edited? Maybe I can help?
---
Did you know there are squirrels too?
---
Fantastic I love it when you try not to let me speak.
---
Yep I have been getting the same issue after most recent patch. If u click pipboy before game screen fully loaded it stuck u in that 
---
I havn't played this game very much but, that gun seems very "OP"?
---
Man this 2 month game is never gonna be gud, better make another shitpost.
---
In all seriousness, I for one did not like NV that much, compared to the originals also 3 was not good. Though I did enjoy both titles, NV a bit less.
---
I did feel a bit dissatisfied with some of the mechanics of 4, especially the conversations, but many things were better. I like 76 but yes, the endgame currently is quite full. But what gives you the idea it can't improve? IMHO Beth did pretty good at fixing bugs. Sure bug x is haunting some people.
---
They're bringing out more content, Hopefully soon more quests etc. Just wait it out I guess, if you enjoyed killing scorched and your first few nukes I am pretty sure you will enjoy new quests. Except if you go in to point out all the flaws, because frankly you can do exactly that with every game. I am sure games like the Witcher can be bad if you want them to be (didn't play tbh). 
---
So shut up and deal with it, Bethesda revived the old interplay / black isle franchise, it might not be what you want, but the same can be said about many things.
---
We can't have just nice things, especially if you remain negative.
---
Any idea when?
---
Hi ******.
---
On what?! I have over 200 
---
Tried that just now nothing happened, then 5 or so minutes later the voice said bulk bay doors opening (or whatever) but never opened .
---
Probably the next patch. 
---
If you put together a stack of VATS critical perk cards you can have it that your VATS accuracy ramps to 95% with a few shots and then every kill fills your critical bar (even critical shot kills, so you can just have almost every shot be a critical shot once you get the first one). Great for low AP cost guns like the combat rifle and handmade and great for shotguns.
---
Ok thanks for clarifying

I'm currently playing with a friend whose level is way lower than mine. Since I can one-hit regular mobs with my hammer, I tend to wait until he tagged the mobs while they hack away at me. It's not a big deal but it impacts the way we engage in combat. Playing together is a lot of fun and I wouldn't want to go solo for proper leveling. 
---
Are they gonna fix All Night Long eventually?
---
Why uninstall the game?? tse is still gonna be the strongest weapons for regular enemies...
---
I always figured a wendigo was what a ghoul looked like that got the power armor glitch and they just ran with it.

Hey man playing a game like that is boring. If I play any game it‚Äôs in 5+ hour portions. 
---
I have a feeling that Bethesda treats their employees like shit. Don't know much about the company though
---
Arm mods seem lame. I dont play unarmed.  
---
I know... A few times I've got a little misty-eyed finding random encounters. 
---
Well it's the only thing that doesnt suck actual testicles and theyre ruining it so im out. Im giving them the chance to not do ot and nerf bobbleheads instead but theyre absolute fuckups so im not too optimistic.
---
Serums and putting deep pockets on everyones gear, lol
---
Maybe they were thinking of Barbie.
---
How much they cost?
---
Wasn‚Äôt just mods. Ignition Cores (a quest item for powering up Mt Blair) can be auto-scrapped as well, EVEN TO MAKE OTHER CORES.  This was a serious WTF issue for me. I‚Äôve seen it happen with damaged mainframe cores too, scrapping multiple ones to repair just one so you end up with less than the required 15 when you‚Äôre done. 
---
The gun you referenced is the Assaultron Head, for anyone not in the know. One shot and it will consume every fusion cell in your inventory. This was a day 1 bug from what I understand, so this was just inexcusable. 
---
Not sure which gun you‚Äôre referring to being broken with perks, but I know one I have in mine, the AGL. For whatever reason it‚Äôs not affected by Bear Arms, which is a serious shame as it weighs nearly 20 pounds and 40mm ammo isn‚Äôt light either without Ordinance Express.  For a grenade launcher, it‚Äôs damage output is rather pathetic as well, like the missile launcher. With ammo that heavy, they should do considerable damage. 
---
I saw three cats hanging out around a junked truck in the middle of the forest. I think I was headed to Lady Janet's Soft Serve.
---
Thanks a lot for taking the time to inform me of all of that. I really appreciate that. I will definitely invest in those perks now that I just hit 50. Thank you.
---
I don't trust you, you will write that i'm a professional horse whisperer or something like that. I know how to do CV's, i already mentioned at the hobby section "looking at pixelated undies in a post-apocalyptic survival game". Don't want you ruin a perfectly good cv.
---
Deep pocket rulz 
---
Yah it is a point of some questing stress just to try underperforming in combat situations and to purposely try evading and not killing mobs so that your partners can take things for xp. If you're like some of us that play only with friends or SO, not sharing tagging and xp can cause for some wildly different levels between characters. And certain playstyles don't go well together, like slow reload stealth sniper with a PA run and gun or melee.  
---
Well if you consider actually having to shoot things with skill to kill them, while using a reals character build to be bland and boring, you be you.
---
No. I'm not. It's needlessly distracting and sexualizes a situation that is not sexy.
---
I reported a few bugs.
---
You took it upon yourself to comment. If you know what it looks like, you have seen how it serves to titillate-- but in a super awkward way. Team that with loading/zoning naked, it's enough is enough.
---
I'm done wasting playing time typing to someone who is so closed minded. I could be getting disconnected from the server and have more fun than argue this with you.
---
Bethesda-- gimme some clothes. 
---
everybody has the capacity to be rude/vulgar, there's no need to exclude "male gamers" from this 
---
Yeah. I get it. But no. See, I have to use all my perks to carry stuff.
---
Enjoy your shitty game. Im playing RE2 now.
---
Droppa da bass
---
Why do people keep thanking Bethesda for stuff that should have gone without saying? It's their job to fix these bugs, they're getting payed for that. You thanked them enough already by buying and playing their game.
---
I took The Crafter root for my group too.  Everything from Fix It Good to Weapon Artisan to Super Duper.  I crafted all our early leather kit and then stuck pockets on all the Legendary stuff.  Friends of friends will be like ‚ÄúHey you‚Äôre Frost?  Can you hook me up‚Äù
---
Yup my milk shakes bring all the boys to the yard.
---
This is fine - if someone killed me. At least then I'd know who to initiate an attack on to get revenge.
---
Eat my ass automod
---
Two many factions thin the heard.  I like the faction idea but servers are small. I say 2 faction pvp is good enough will this small number of people per server
---
How do you manage to move items between characters?
---
There's SB everywhere once you start really exploring the woods between marked locations. The first SB I met was in morgantown but I've seen them by the vault 76 entrance too. They seem to get all over the place.
---
Killing them for their loot is great. Griefy, sure, but shit you earned it. And got wanted for it too if you weren't just bounty hunting. But if you can steal someone's water from their purifier and get wanted, why should you get off free for stealing their death bag when you didn't kill them first?
---
I could get behind that, at least you would know who to attempt to get your shit back from.
---
I agree. I can't go 2 steps without getting a disease.  I think it's a bit much considering ur wearing a rad suit and power armor over it.  How is anything getting thru all that.
---
While I've been the subject of misogynistic behaviour online in the past, I haven't experienced any in my 200+ hours of playing 76. I don't know if PC is less abusive in general compared to consoles, but I've only ever had good experiences. 
---
I have an obviously female username, and I use my microphone. 
---
Honestly, I think some people are just dicks and they know it. 
---
Concentrate and ask again.
---
Yes, tell us, we will know.
---
Dude you really can't compare Overwatch to Fallout 76.
---
"Also, mole miner gauntlet is numerically inferior in every way. Less damage, and 50% more weight than even a death claw gauntlet. 15 and 10 pounds respectively. Good luck out there."
---
Mod them up to their best damage (which increases weight of deathclaw gauntlet), put on Martial Artist then the difference is 271 damage &amp; 5.2 lbs vs 268 damage &amp; 6 lbs in my case. An absolutely tiny difference. I'm doing very well thanks. 
---
Luckily, anyone who feels they‚Äôre being harassed can make a report. I felt the need to bring up the behavior towards females bc statistics along with my own personal experience have shown that females are subjected to online harassment by a larger percentage. But yes, males who are being harassed or bullied can definitely make a report too. Thanks for looking out. 
---
It's only a waste if your constantly there to collect, since they only hold a few at a time. 
---
Go adventuring for thirty minutes, and if you have one industrial purifier you'll have 5 water. If you have 5 purifiers you'll have 25.
---
I never said death wasn't tame, and I'm not comparing this game to anything else. It's not even an mmo. If I wanted to play something where I lost everything on death, I would. I'm saying there should be consequence for taking another player's stuff, like there is elsewhere in the game already, like picking someone's locked resource gatherer in camp.
---
You use a friend as a go between, or have 2 PCs and 2 games.....
---
its almost as if you wernt ment to hit such high levels already....
---
That‚Äôs awesome to hear! I hate hearing from my friends that they‚Äôre afraid to post trade requests to forums or join factions or parties due to inappropriate behavior. 
---
Ah, hoping there was some alternative to those haha 
---
It's a gamble..I don't have regulars I play with..so I stick around for a while.. add someone whose been there for a while..sneak off..dump my stuff in a world container..switch accounts and join back up with the guy and hope to God he's in the same server still. Hasn't gone sideways yet.. kind if annoying to have to do though.
---
How much of the story have you actually experienced, or are you only focused on getting to the next level?
---
What if you just have really really nice coasters?
---
Apparently they're only dedicating the team that made the fruit hat for the atom shop to the PvP mode so we shouldn't see a decrease in the team working on PvE. I got this as insider information but I can't reveal my source....
---
That would defy the one and only purpose of paper bags. They penalty for dieing is already next to nothing, bc it's just junk you loose. Flagging others as wanted for picking them up would be ridiculous.
---
I get it, you want to hang on to those precious screws/springs/whatever, but that's the way it goes. 
---
That's weird there was just a TV show on about this on adult swim. Like, just an hour ago it was on here. Probably just finished airing on the west coast just now.
---
And this is cyberbullying how? I don't know these people, nor do I message them out of game or yell any hateful or personal messages. I will simply do what the game allows me to do.
---
I'm actually happy for once that this leg if current content as an mmo has an actual perpetual endgame. Reason being tou feel somewhat accomplished. At least u till new content arrives. Most mmos is a variation of chest and checked and just keep going against a bigger player over and over. Grind.
---
humble brag
---
Really?? What show was it? 
---
Aw, nobody will miss you. Toodles
---
It could also leave behind "drippings" that give away your trail, and other players tracking you could fuel the hydration meter on them.
---
Same to you, when you wake up.
---
I think its a way to get all the tse owning assholes to go all in one server an leave us the ones with tse that dont need to go around shooting everyone to prove it to be in peace, kids and newcomers with their high demands and wanting it to be like fortnite, all this pvp mentality is what causes wars in real life lmao just saying 
---
"they just wanted to give those that WANTED a multiplayer Fallout a game to play, which they did"
---
No one asked for *this*. People wanted co-op, not this free-to-play (overpriced cash shop, no NPCs, weird PvP mechanics), but not free-to-play game. It's not to say I don't enjoy it, but it's obvious they want to go a different way with monetization, and I'd be surprised if they allow mods/private servers in the future.  
---
Regardless, article is about the refund policy.
---
And Corpse Flower Stamens.
---
I‚Äôll make sure to post it as soon as it‚Äôs ready :) 
---
I understand now what you mean and will edit my post again, thank you for specifying. on the other hand though, given that a much larger percentage of "gamers" are male, I'd  still say the online antagonization should be addressed for everybody 
---
Suppose for the same reason they used to hate fallout 4. Probably the same people, not sure what they are looking for.
---
Pardon me for disagreeing, but losing everything you farmed today for logging back in at the wrong moment is kinda ridiculous too.
---
Nice one!
---
What idiot doesn't make a text frame that dynamically changes to fit the text
---
I have most weight perks too, and just whip out the TSE shotty to one shot anything or maybe 2 or 3 shot some bigger things. Easy peasy. But yeah, I hate that gun. I mean it saves my ass when it gets handed to me by a Mirelurk Queen or something (low health melee) but yeah. I think those weapons have actually ruined the game. We could have been having fun pvping with Assassin's armor -40% pvp damage. I had saved every piece I ever found. But apparently it's pointless because TSE one shots everything.
---
Mostly base destruction or for hordes of enemies close by
---
I've got over 500 hours game time and I'm level 250+ and I was quite content with endless end game farming, until last night..
---
So this week i spent the few hours I had every night after work grinding for ammo so come Friday I can farm the queen. Anyway long story short the game crashed while she was near death three times in a row. Different server, different silo run, different players.
---
The only thing for me to do now is quit this fucking heap of shit game until either, 1. It's fucking fixed which I doubt. 2. Anthem release.
---
So that's why I hate this game.
---
Bethesda please fix your fucking game!
---
I found the latest 3\* in the Mire and Savage Divide by walking along the roads. Typical youtube-suggested farming locations don't even spawn legendaries most of the time for me.
---
Game has crashed on me every time I respawn after the last patch.  Playing on PC. 1.0.4.13
---
I guess they could also up the level range on new weapons / drops maybe lvl 60 or they could start putting in 4 / 5 star drops.
---
No one is forcing any one to start over either, the old characters would still be available on the current servers.

---
I totally agree on that with you, mate. But that's something Bethesda has to fix. And I don't mean the paper bag issue ;-). It should not be possible to spawn into a nuked zone. 
---
Luck is such a fucking pain to fly thru every time for startched genes when farming mutations
---
Oooo plz! This is something I have been agonizing over a lot while building lol.  The interior side of walls.... we need more varieties of looks on the wall part that faces inward to us. We also need interior home walls and outer home walls. It is a struggle pain to make interior rooms in a home but the outside facing wall is the texture that should only be on the OUTSIDE of your house.  
---
Or give us some sort of paint sprayer or wallpaper that we can equip that will change the side of the wall we touch, or just make it only useable with interior wall sides.  
---
Inventory management mods. I don't know any others but those ones need to be part of the standard game.
---
Sometimes they will continue what they were doing when you initiate the trade. Phoenix will often continue to battle when I‚Äôm trading with him. 
---
I can 1 shot most things sneaking anyway. It just sucks they gotta ruin shit. See, I use a TSE handmade and an AP handmade. Meanwhile I get 1 shot with slap damage from retards stacking bobbleheads.
---
Ive just realized that everything in the game is inherently broken and their only fixes are to break other things. Im really just done. Ive done everything. Its just boredom now and waiting for the next bug. Wish I hadnt spent my money in it. Ill definitely hesitate on the next ES and fallout games. 
---
Instigating = double damage in the first shot and it‚Äôs a max level Dragon black powder rifle shooting a level 20 something deathclaw. It‚Äôs kinda like kicking a puppy with spiked steel toe shoes
---
PvP, i use them to wreck people's bases
---
At least  AZERTY  keyboard layout's have been improved now!

---
I wish you guys would stop perpetuating that 5% shit. It was one stat from some goal that someone took off PS4 weeks ago. This sub is so bad about taking random shit and just rolling with it.
---
That being said, three months isn't even *that* long. If you're gonna use random stats, how about throwing out the one that says less than 25% (it was somewhere around 20-25 I believe) of us are over level 50. That means that the majority of players aren't even to the point where they'd be looking for new content yet. 
---
I'd love new PVE content but we've seen what happens when they rush. I don't think that the PVP content they're working on is going to take that much to implement, and everyone's getting their panties all in a bunch without very much actual and verified information. As usual. 
---
&gt; My guess was they pulled content from the game to accommodate for future patches to brush off as free DLC
---
This is what I'm talking about. Stop doing this nonsense. It's nothing but wild speculation that causes more ridiculous rumors and toxicity. There's plenty to give constructive criticism about without using your imagination to make it worse. 
---
For caps it's not worth the weight to carry it. That's why you're encumbered all the time. Better off looting circuits and nuclear material to sell.
---
I'll bite. Grab a video clip of those weapons side by side and lets see it. All the resources I have say MMG is inferior, and it's mod is inferior. If they're right, your numbers can't possibly be correct. My buddy ran a rad rage build and he wouldn't even consider a MMG side by side with a DCG. 
---
Also, martial artist doesn't affect weapon damage, only swing speed. More damage sure, but not from one to the other.
---
it seems more likely this is a glitch than something that wasn't designed to do that
---
You got downvoted because they don't want that. What they actually want is to be upset. Hell if I know why. This game makes people so dramatic. 
---
The missile launcher will break before the cargobot.  Oddly it seems to hurt itself more than the enemy
---
Shhhh. That almost sounds like a criticism
---
When junk is 100% scrapped it should become weightless. Or at least make it weightless in the stash, so you can‚Äôt just carry all the junk around with you.
---
Ah, now that sounds truly interesting. I mean, regular accuracy comes very easily, but to have consecutive criticals, after the initial crit, is pretty valuable. I like that idea; will definitely want to play with perk crits at some point in the future.
---
Mannn am I the only one that likes that chandelier? It was insta-buy for me. It's so pointy and neat. 
---
i used one to kill level 50-68 legendaries at level 33 whilst starting out Rose's signal quest
---
I was like you. The grind post lv80 felt bad. Perhaps it was just in my head
---
Spicy 
---
How would having 50 unique guns and armor not be a strain on the server??
---
Yes that‚Äôs what I meant. Balanced so you have as much junk as you can get in your stash but still have it weigh in your inventory.
---
Only if you‚Äôre solidly grinding one area and server hopping. That ain‚Äôt fun
---
Well read my post mate. I said that those numbers were pulled out of the air as an example.
---
Unfortunately that isn‚Äôt a new behaviour, been this way since the beginning of multiplayer games. I kinda hope it‚Äôs not as bad as it used to be though
---
I have been [eagerly awaiting](https://i.imgur.com/qCd4Hmu.jpg) a glass roof...
---
I love it. I could build a family home with two kids rooms with the current stuff. 
---
I met a guy and girl over mic, we teamed up, and now he sends me a msg when I log into my account, sometimes like 4 msgs in a row and calls me babe. I just want nice people to play the friggin game with dude. I feel bad for blocking him because they're a fun duo to play with. 
---
Tedious.
---
yeah i saw one once after 200 hours, one of the first times i played on xbox
---
Nah, and in the 3 hours they spent playing it in the office they never got past level 13 then rage quit when the Finance department Overwatch team stole there springs and screws and wouldn't give them back
---
Y2K? What are you selling? Chicken or sex jelly?
---
maybe, but if you dont get oneshot.
---
You will really have a hard time once you die and the person keeps killing you.
---
The enemy can kill you until you have zero stimpacks left...
---
It‚Äôs a trap!
---
Beta's are timed demo's these days nothing more, PR stunts / Gimmicks.
---
Nothing broken in BETA was fixed was it? 
---
It would be a simple fix but why would Bethesda bother fixing it when they can ignore it ; )
---
Im away from the ps4 for about a week but can see what I can share when I get back. It isn't "one" missile... don't mistake me. But it is doable.

It wasn't to late though, it still isn't! I mean they could fix it, maybe they were hoping no one noticed, or it will fix itself?
---
Killed one down in The Burning Mine, thought it was a ghoul and sniped at it and am still hoping to never see one again!

Admitting to knowing it might be bullshit while using it to support your comment isn‚Äôt really better.

Dont forget about the free disease cure fountain at whitesprings. If I am nearby or have more than 1 at a time I just pop over there and cure them all. Saves a lot of cures in the long run.

Saw this before. They must have had a camp there and recently left the server. Saw someone leave before my eyes and their power armor was just floating in the air since it was on the secnd floor after their camp disappeared. 
---
Just go to silva homestead stock up on corn boil loads of dirty water an make corn soup hey presto youve got food and water
---
You're such a courageous hero.
---
I would imagine it wasn't intended to look like shit.
---
I just use orbital strike beacons. Bigger, better boom and only 1 weight. 
---
yeah, this would be great, i think it would be an inherent feature to the perk system along with the ability to Store the cards you don't need in there for swapping ever. Store the prompt to pick one and store the ones you don't want to use.
---
other than that i'd like to see picking a perk the 2nd time just give you the next level version. the UI to upgrade cards by owning two identical ones is unnecessary. This is one of the central ideas I put in my response to the inside the vault call for feedback.
---
I assume that Beth completely underestimated the drive people would have to level up as fast as possible as well as the possibility of XP glitches.
---
As such they likely though it would be months before we see anyone level 100+ but now we have people level 2000+.
---
It was a bit naive on there part IMO.
---
I think this is a great idea and might even be fun. 
---
Doesn‚Äôt that give you a huge bounty though? I learned my lesson with artillery on this topic. 
---
Not really a waste, they store what they make, so one stores up to 5 an three gives 15, how is that a waste?
---
Once a upon a time I used a female character for Final Fantasy 11. Without getting too much into the mechanics of the game, I was using the character for the stat boosts that worked good for the class I was playing. This was in the days before voice chat was common, so after awhile for shits and giggles I just started answering yes to the plethora of guys asking if I was really the girl. Yes, woman get harassed. And they get harassed a lot. The experiment ended when I a guy I had been playing with quite a bit invited me to his party one day. Instead of going to level he took me to an ingame waterfall and started telling me he wanted to date me. I just stopped playing after that. 
---
Are you on PC? This has been happening a lot since last patch but esp worse the last few days or week. Tonight I had another crash to desktop after loading in to a slow and laggy server for two minutes. Next load up I had a server that was mostly stable until I got randomly disconnected. And I always play in a team, so these things are also happening to everyone else in my team, not just me. 
---
because the perk UI should be streamlined as a basic design concept where the interface respects the user's time reasonable.
---
That's an optimistic time frame.
---
Overwatch is an FPS MOBA... No one gives a shit about the story and change is expected.
---
You definitely don't need to carry all that ammo on you at once.
---
Move your camp to a less populated spot...
---
true, i spent time calling this out in my feedback post to response to the inside the vault call for feedback
---
The thing is I like my spot, I just feel like this would be an important feature. 
---
Indeed. Still lots to do. Still not found every location either.
---
hi NordChick. 
---
If they did that, you would get less populated maps because everyone would put their camps in the best spots and never join a map with anyone else lol
---
the crafted amo have less wegth than junk becuase perk card.
---
Because they're typical entitled gamers that let for-profit youtubers do the thinking for them
---
Good point, it‚Äôs just a nuisance to load up and then have to jump back out because someone build even remotely near me
---
I think scaling only occurs during quests. So if you are doing the Rose quests for example the enemies will scale when you go to the locations marked on that quest line. The rest of the map is set level ranges that aren't changed based on your level. Harper's Ferry for example will usually be 60ish but it can vary. 
---
[Read this](https://imgur.com/gallery/ZNSaq) and this bug will become even more terrifying
---
No problem
---
You mean "your rifle does (%) damage" ?
---
wait... what? -runs off to log in-
---
I hear you. There are loads of spots I'd like my camp but that's the nature of the beast and I don't see it changing. I'm just glad my camp doesn't just store itself anymore
---
Ok, maybe that's what is causing it because it is doing it again. And now in an eternal load screen. Ug..
---
Don't panic, but there are *squirrels* too. ;)
---
Agreed. Letting for profit youtubers think for you is really not a healthy way to spend free time
---
&gt; Wasn‚Äôt just mods. Ignition Cores (a quest item for powering up Mt Blair) can be auto-scrapped as well, EVEN TO MAKE OTHER CORES. This was a serious WTF issue for me. 
---
Was annoying as shit wondering why I couldn't get more than one to build then realizing it wasn't just the usual crafting lag but that the cores were a higher priority resource than the actual raw crafting material in the auto scrap logic and I needed to drop each core as I built them to get around it.
---
Kind of all  weapons if you are facing off against late game enemies they often have just obscene DR and HP pools to wallow in while they deal true damage that ignores PA and perks.
---
Yep, that sounds like it haha. Thank you. 
---
New vegas was worse for some bugs, now it's the "best game in the seris" if you ask the same "gamers" that shat all over it on release
---
I carry two Laser Gatlings, because in my experience energy weapons break faster. I carry one shotgun, which is good for most scenarios as it doesn't chew through the ammo as quickly as my automatic heavy weapons, but I feel like it breaks quicker than most ballistic weapons. My other ballistic weapons that I'd prefer to carry which also benefit from my weight reduction perks don't do enough damage to use them against bigger enemies, or simply waste too much ammo because they're automatic.
---
My Gatling Gun tends to last for a long time, and uses ammo more slowly, but its damage output is pitiful.
---
Because I use all of my perks for weight reduction, I have no space for damage perks, which leads to wasting more ammo. If I were to reverse that, I'd have fewer choices when one of my easily breakable weapons break. It's difficult at times when I run out of resources to repair my weapons with.
---
I pseronally like this idea. I have a couple thoughts on what it could look like.
---
Even if the new characters didn‚Äôt add depth to the story, it would be more immersive to run across 1 or 2 at a campsite out in the wastes. Could even add them so they could be recruited to your settlement for the price of defending it and ‚Äútending‚Äù to crops like they did in FO4. Just make them un-killable once they‚Äôre claimed where they can be downed and can‚Äôt fight back anymore but their health regens once enemies are dealt with
---
Would be really cool, albeit unlikely, if they added the abilty to take spouses with human (or even ghoul maybe if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre into) npc‚Äôs and you could have kids that kinda work as a companion of sorts, think about the squires from fo4, that follow you around a ‚Äúlearn the ropes‚Äù from you. Be even cooler if they added onto that and your kids grew up eventually and you could send them out scavenging for supplies or something or even just be a full on npc companion like in past games minus the dialogue branches. 
---
Maybe they could add a quest to get antibiotics for your sick/dying spouse or child before they get too sick and die. I don‚Äôt personally think Bethesda would ever put that much effort into anything like this but it could be a cool mod for pc players (not me though. I‚Äôd just have to watch videos and wish I played on pc lol)
---
Idk I‚Äôm just spitballing ideas here
---
No sorry I mean tank killer perk rifles ignore 12% armor and have a change to stagger
---
&gt; Most of us hate how enemies in this game are massive bullet spounges. Tse weapons are the only viable guns. 
---
Yes, so fix the sponginess. 
---
I personally like it cause its like, "er yea my levels so high it broke the box barrier for the level on my character". Just makes me feel more op.
---
Are you high in the sky?
---
I like the idea of them, but they're slow to use and entirely wasted unless you're ready to deploy them immediately after the SBQ lands.  Sometimes she stays on the ground for a while, and sometimes she launches back into the air almost immediately.
---
I feel like the damage should at least be buffed 100x, given how situational they are.  A massive energy blast coming from low earth orbit should take a significant chunk out of a giant bat queen's health and be much more effective than any explosive small arms fire.  An orbital strike should be treated at the ultimate in artillery.  An energy blast is coming in from space, for fuck's sake.  I don't want it to cheese a Scorched Earth, but fabricating and carrying the resources to call down a strike should be worthwhile.  Maybe 5-10% of her health would be great.  I've seem strikes that seemed to do nothing to her health bar and not even outright kill nearby trash mobs.
---
Modding /=/ lore friendly
---
Regular scorchbeasts have a habit of just flying away if Im winning the fight,either that or they hover in one spot and spam the screech without pause.
---
1. Known plan indicator
---
2. Glowing bags
---
3. Detailed map
---
lol yeah DAE fucking hate this game? 
---
I don't have any suggestions, but this sounds amazing. it would certainly breathe some life into the game in terms of player interaction, instead of just waving and continuing on there would be a sort of little market place or player hang out spot 
---
I have same couches, isn't it modern couches or modern chairs plan or something?
---
Winner!
---
Yes I get that aswell but with the queen she left and never came back before the time she is meant to do that
---
What kind of stuff 
---
You will need to ask my friend PeachClaw568853 he has it
---
the only one sexualizing the situation is you.
---
how are they to fix it? change the animation just for you? your character is wearing clothes and underwear, only choice is if you dont like it wear something else....or close your eyes...or just dont play the game if something like this offends you, dont know why you are even playing games if you are offended so easily.
---
I had someone block me before trying to take my workshop.Unlucky/lucky for me a scorchbeast decided to come and start wrecking my crap and ultimately leading to me killing both with a Tesla rifle.I made 300 or so caps off his bounty.
---
Probably yes, its a combat shotgun (Rifle) i think?
---
I have seen this before.
---
A Hooker, would be a good prize.
---
The AI has issues and will just fly away sometimes if you do too much damage in a short amount of time.
---
Towns are teamwork oriented wasteland neighborhood system.
---
for it to work, it has to begin with a team system that involves a group larger than the 4 player team, ideally with a leveling up aspect that either is tied to the TOWNS tech or just the group itself.
---
My best luck has come from leaving my game on the main menu to avoid mobs
---
Not at all, play mostly with pump and db
---
Stop taking so much damage.
---
I have both it and the race car bed. My camp exterior is decorated with princess beds and christmas trees. Its so bright and pink its offensively beautiful.
---
I fucking hate this.
---
That we are STILL talking about this garbage.

---
Did we not heed this call?
---
If the person has a bounty their camp becomes fair game to all players if what I was told was true.
---
ive killed her in shorter times before so the latter isnt it i just blame the as you mentioned crappy ai/a bug
---
Yeah, that inability to walk past a clipboard with grabbing it almost got me thrown out of the hospital while visiting a friend.
---
i remember a thread in one of the fallout subs before 76 came out where someone was saying ‚Äútake me home country roads‚Äù was in the game becasuse Fallout 3 was 1950‚Äôs and Fallout 4 was 1960‚Äôs so obviously the next one would be 1970‚Äôs. I dont understand where they got that idea from when its specifically stated in lore and in canon that the games alternate timeline had the culture essentially stagnate permanantly in the 1950‚Äôs. I dont even like that we now have red dot and holographic sights for firearms in game because to me that detracts from the early cold war aesthetic. Like theres a difference between retrofuturistic stuff like laser/plasma weapons, power armor and weird robots and having characters in game walking around with iphones and directly breaking established lore.
---
They are still worth more than Quantum grenades....Even with perks the enemies have to be standing right ontop of it, and even then the guy standing next to him will be unscathed.  
---
A huge let down after the horror that is Nuka Grenades.
---
I'd like that, but only for team mates please!
---
They never thought that anyone would bother playing this game for that long.
---
You have a ultracite jetpack?
---
Now that's someone not playing with a full deck.
---
ok, I am sharing your efforts with the Fallout Feed community
---
Had this happen a few times, it's always in the last 1/4 health and &lt;10min left to kill her, if you knock her dead in the first 1-5min you don't get the issues
---
Nope 
---
Well this was my question two months ago and issues like these are why I haven't reinstalled since
---
Quality assurance and Bethesda don't mix 
---
This is the shittiest part of pvp in any game ive ever seen
---
I think their reasoning was to have a choice between power and resources. Yet I agree, you always find yourself overburdened anyway.
---
Since the latest patch ive  had 6 different explosive guns drop. most 2 stars. But not a single piece of usable armor. I've literally been using the same right leg since level 40 and im 403 now. Its a level 30 leather weapon weights/poison resist/troubleshooters. The only other semi usable right leg ive had is a 2\* unyielding/perception piece. Thats it. 
---
But my mule has so many other crazy good limbs that are sitting there useless cause my equipped are slightly better. Ive added no armor to my mule since latest patch, but at least 7 weapons.
---
One thing is certain: some people are going to be dissapointed. 
---
What makes you think a shotgun is a rifle? 
---
They probably didn't think people would play the game long enough to go over level 100  :P
---
Same thing happened to me, I think what happened was I accidentally transferred the ammo to the SBQ's body while trying to get my loot and someone else took my ammo. 
---
Yeah it's so annoying. They should have solved this issue by now, it's really a pathetic that a studio as large as Bethesda with all their resources is failing to resolve a game breaking issue like this. 
---
I‚Äôm here for the stuff
---
So just remove mats impact on the character, eat/drinking and carry weight so you can play something like a shooter RPG without survival.
---
Seems like you're looking for Borderlands/Destiny, no?
---
I'm playing less because there is a lack of endgame content.
---
Yea, my bad, I didn't fully understand your post. Upon re-reading I agree if you spawn into a nuke zone and die someone shouldn't be able to loot your death bag
---
Make a new character?
---
Yeah, but we can't really blame that on the community managers, at least these guys seem to be trying to talk to us. Upper management are the culprits here
---
I am on PC, saw a guy yesterday with the paladin paint, I'm pretty sure it's in the game, just not sure how exactly u get it.
---
3* legendaries drop 1* item and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm just unlucky 
---
I wonder what kind of asshole you gotta be and what have you gone through to be like that to a little kid. People never fail to amaze you sometimes.
---
Sorry you and specially your son had to go through that crap.
---
Keep in mind i'm not using this to justify the 1.0 state of the game. It was (at times) a colossal mess. Bethsoft seem to be trying their hardest to rectify that, though so points for effort
---
It's an unfortunate undercurrent in the gaming community. Thankfully, it's not everywhere,  but it's enough of an issue to be a problem. Not just for women, but for people of color or different oritentations as well. I've been gaming for over 35 years and have seen the gamut, not just online, but in person. A lot of it isn't even meant to be overt,  like use of the n-word, but it's ingrained stuff in some people- like calling things they find stupid "gay". They may not mean anything homophobic by it,  but it still associates the word gay with something bad. I'm a straight white dude and even I understand how that could make people feel. After all, "white male" these days is almost an epithet itself among the extreme left (I'm a moderate left myself), so I can understand why people don't like being marginalized like that. 
---
I'd like to think it's getting better. I've played with several women in FO76 doing nuke events and the like and haven't heard anything bad,  but I know it does happen. It's why I avoid the IGN comments section these days. The hatred for anything female and claim that EVERYTHING is some sort of agenda to undermine them is really dumb. I understand that feminist extremists can be frustrating, and I hate identity politics as much as the next guy, but that's any extremist group. No need to treat all women like they're scum (I'm sure people have seen some of the reactions to suffragettes in RDR2, which is honestly disturbing- not people playing a bad guy and killing them, but the way so many of them act like they want to do it in real life). Or to act like adding females to BFV is some sort of affront to veterans (it doesn't take anything away from our vets) or historical accuracy, when three people are riding around on a horse with flamethrowers and people are launching tanks into planes with C4.
---
I just don't understand the hatred, why it's so hard to treat other people respectfully, or why trying to include other groups is a bad thing.
---
Thanks for that. Hopefully bethesda patch this soon 
---
Ammosmith perk plus super duper perk will turn 300ish lead step Angeles gunpowder into roughly 2k ammo
---
I always thought it was ban dai!
---
What system are you on? 
---
I just want to be able to hotkey my PA. I'm a little over the whole "open pipboy/go to apparel/scroll down to power armor frame/accidentally click prototype hazmat suit instead/unequip entire armor config like some kind of jabroni/scream internally" routine.
---
Yep, it's an unspoken rule that you don't build a camp around the Whitesprings Golf Course and the Charleston Train Station.
---
Brilliant idea 
---
thanks rate it so more people will read it
---
As someone trying to make a red rocket themed base, would you care to share some pics?
---
Your ammo with 90% weight reduction weighs several times more than useful ammo without a 90% weight reduction perk card and isn't bringing in any damage or really any redeeming quality whatsoever to make up for it. 
---
If you can't call that useless then I suppose 'garbage' works about as well. 
---
And suddenly it all makes sense why my buddy blue screens constantly and I only blue screen when playing with him. He‚Äôs using a targeting hud.
---
Coming in next patch. Check the notes
---
checking...
---
Anything. As long as you Mike a second bag.
---
It's a planned feature in the next patch.

You're right, that idea is wrong. And Country Roads doesn't fit either, but I can give it a pass because it is the song for West Virginia, and you can head-canon bit that the in-game version was created in the 1950s. Maybe  that's why they hired a gritty, bit bluesy singer. But random Beach Boys songs, no.

Nice reference. 
---
Whenever I first found a flare gun and ammo for it I half expected some minute men even though I know there wasn‚Äôt any NPC‚Äôs.
---
I didnt knooooow the gun was loaded!
---
Apologies, it's from the inside the vault article.

I don‚Äôt even need them that much any more, and end up selling the excess, but I still hover them up. 
---
Oh I was talking about the missile launcher weighing 4 pounds. Missiles weigh like 0.3  pounds. Not bad at all actually 
---
I'm full of adhesive but still the other day said to myself "I need to change the plants at my camp so I can make starch".
---
"Vault Raids"!!!!
---
As someone who has been trying to politely call Bethesda's sloppiness and got nothing but vitriol...
---
Gee I wonder how this came to be /s
---
Not sure but I have seen many crazy things in fallout haha. But thanks 
---
Lost some faith in humanity after reading this :(
---
If you‚Äôre on Xbox I can donate some junk to you guys 
---
They said I don't have a reservation.
---
Play on pc, every time you hear shit like this it's on console
---
Can't blame some random person in a PVPve game for killing players / taking the loot, if he was level 300 in full 3\* Leg's id have a bit more sympathy but you even said he was the same level as you guys then mention his OP gear?
---
It sucks it really does, BUT its PEGI 15 and farming players for junk is a legitimate way to get scrap etc. 
---
You also mention you're not sure if your son shot back...were you watching? Did he shoot back? Or did he Han solo it and shoot first?
---
Should have encouraged your lad to go and get the stuff back himself, not grabbing the controller and getting all angry about it. Of course hes going to have a negative experience when Dad's irate and hopping around raging about some pixels. It could have been a good experience to show him the other side of PVP games, and that when someone comes along and tries to take your stuff / bully you, you can stand your ground in a positive way.
---
That said If i see this guy, ill introduce him to my Sledgehammer and tell him Tashtago says hi as I send him a picture of me dumping his junk in the river :)
---
Do you mean Pacifist Mode? Because players can still hurt you with it enabled, it only affects your own damage output.
---
bobbleheads
---
I think he more likely in the moutnin regions of the great divide possably
---
Wow, what an jerk. I'm a raider myself and even I wouldn't go that far.
---
Also naming and shaming isn't allowed on this sub:
---
&gt; 9. No Witchhunting. Do not ask users to go after other players in game. Do not accuse players of cheating, use Bethesda's official support¬†here.
---
Check the Missle Silo Holotape
---
Claim the workshops if you can get 3 or 4 you  can  jump from one to the other saving them from attack you get plans and you level up reasonably fast.

Oh cool!

How do you keep dying to much?

It's a video game.

Just throw on a hat and say your from Vault-Tec instead.

Seeing a new issue with SBQ fights. The SBQ suddenly flies away off map and stops outside the boundary. If it flies to a boundary you can still see it, it stops mid flight in the air, you can't damage it and it keeps popping mobs that die as soon as they hit the ground.  
---
This has happened the last 2/3 SBQ fights, the other 1/3 I crashed after being spammed by a normal SB's sonic attack. The game stopped when the visuals were hitting me and I got a CTD.
---
100 power cores and your walking slow due to the ammo you just made?
---
What would logging in and out do for you being over weight?
---
Well that‚Äôs lame. Have you actually taken time and Explore and read all notes and terminals and things? A lot of great moments come from those. 
---
New toon, no power armour, don't buy any weapons or armour, only what you pick up, don't craft weapons or armour either, no melee. The games a lot harder when you only use the dropped weapons armour and drop it after its used.
---
It's a lot of resources for multiple machines you have to visit relatively often to benefit from. And if you dont lock them they are liable to just end up constantly empty from other people looting them of the water.
---
Heck, if they *are* locked then said people just blow them up half the time. It's a problem that shouldn't exist that is bypassed by the player having to spam a machine and using up base building space that otherwise might be better used in some circumstances.
---
That, or they should just read 5/hr and cut the crap.
---
Oh my God yes 
---
I didn‚Äôt need it to go melee stealth around the zombies within the golf club one shorting them with an instigating death claw gauntlet. If you can‚Äôt one shot them though then maybe it has its worth regaining stealth
---
There are satellites.  Have you not called down orbital strikes?  Makes sense that every pip boy would be tracked. 
---
Ye

---
Alright, I'm ready. When are you back on :p
---
Once upon a time I needed the steel and plastic, but now it's just an addiction, I can't stop myself, especially at the BoS vendor in Watoga...
---
Yeah, after a failed SBQ run the other day sapped my power cores and ammo, and then the game once again crashed after taking a power plant workshop to make more cores, I just stopped playing. That's 4 times now I've either crashed to desktop or disconnected from server within 10-15 of starting to make cores. Just not worth the aggravation.
---
Get good
---
I don't care about that rule after reading this.  I've spread the account name everywhere I can already...  
---
So you saying that stealth melee is actually playable?
---
Sorry you‚Äôre getting downvoted, but that‚Äôs spot-on.
---
Yes, people, small scope changes are much easier to do for independent modders than for the studio. This is true not just of Bethesda, but any studio large enough to have any kind of process in place. That‚Äôs just how it is, *inevitably*, and you‚Äôd probably see why if you stopped to think for a second rather than rage. 
---
Kinda bad when you compare it to how you can easily carry ~5-10k of many bullet types with Bandolier yet just carrying 1000 missiles as a single ammunition type is out of the question with just that alone taking up 300 lbs of inventory space and for mini nukes it wouldn't even be possible to carry that many of them just by themselves without being instantly overencumbered even with double calibrated shocks+high Str build.
---
Nop. Decent men aren't valued any more and don't get any reward or recognition while the supposed indecent do. So let people live their lives and stay in your lane.
---
Just one military power armor paint from F4 in 76
---
I‚Äôm actually ranged stealth, but even with a suppressed Gauss rifle (non-legendary), there are a lot of mobs that don‚Äôt go down in one shot. 
---
You dont need thousands of missiles. I usually run a couple dozen. The biggest hindrance is rarity and how hard they are to craft. Not the weight.
---
Thanks Mom
---
I'd rather increase the amount Ammosmith produces or just how much you can craft. Your perk sounds like a nightmare. It's basically a brakemans TS unless that "extra bullet" is loaded back into the ammo reserves.
---
Because the game is incredibly lazy in literally every aspect and had next to zero testing before release
---
Pretty good idea honestly, I lov the sos quests in Monster Hunter
---
I got junk if you're on xbox
---
Hey man I just got a [3* medic minigun](https://imgur.com/a/TjC7kzK) off the SBQ today and remembered seeing this thread.  You can honestly have it for free if you're interested I'm already at max caps anyway.
---
thank you :)
---
Let's just start with this concept: You just shot someone...in the face...with a god damned missile.Let's start there and then discuss damage.
---
...and that's a bad thing WHY?
---
I've seen it do some damage in a Queen fight once she's landed.  Other than that, I've mostly seen them used in base-smashing.  &gt;:-(
---
Nowhere in those guidelines does it say he cant name someone. He didn't break any rules. You could argue #4, sure. But 9? Where did he accuse someone of cheating or ask other players to go after him? Yeah, maybe 4, but that prick deserves it.
---
Yeah its been bugged since launch still waiting for it to be fixed, keep the maps till it is.
---
It's to warn you of people coming in your base really, not to attract people, it's built with that in mind :-)
---
So what's next then? I can start by naming and shaming anyone that does one of the following things just because some people complained about it:
---
* Building a camp with turrets next to the Whitesprings Golfcourse which denies others to kill the ghouls. 
---
* Building a camp next to the Charleston Train Station which denies players to spawn the Responder vendor bot.
---
* Using a TSE in the Whitesprings nuke zone so that others don't get a chance to tag the ghouls
---
* Getting killed by someone just because you have accidentally hit him/her because it's "griefing".
---
* Getting killed in your workshop.
---
* Killing all the legendary enemies in an event (Uranium Fever) without letting others tag them. 
---
So, I guess that the amount of players that have done one of these things would be large. 
---
Its been several months. Why do people defend this hubk of shit
---
Could even use it to spawn an event style fast travel point to the player needing help
---
How so it cannot activate just like that for no reason somone has to be pulling the lever and if im not in base then how i will get the call for help or something if i cannot hear nothing after 200m ?
---
I don't use TSE weapons in pvp. Most of my fights are one or 2 hits sadly. One time it was about 5 hits but I still killed then in about 3 seconds. I can't make them take defensive perks. I can't agree more with your points though. I haven't found the dense mod for combat armor but fireproof is awesome.
---
Well if Bethesda would openly allow the use of mods then you can use perk loadouts and hotkey them
---
I thought you could hook it to a laser trip or pressure plate to trigger it, the handle is just to test, maybe be I am wrong....
---
Ok now we need a comic strip about Todd's adventures in the wasteland!
---
Don't let that group of raiders get hold of him, hmmm fresh meat!
---
It seems people aren‚Äôt realizing how much more useful demolition weapons will be after the nerf to ts and explosive. Nothing is gonna touch my bloodied Fatman on the damage number, too bad I never carry it around.
---
There is a gilded minigun in game
---
sadly this has been patched :( 
---
I was watching an old movie the other night, some 40s film noir private eye thriller. The protagonist had an electric desk fan on his desk, and when I spotted it, I swear my instant thought was, "Grab that for the screws."
---
The world's are just virtual server instances. There is no new infrastructure required and therefore no 'opportunity cost' involved. 
---
You stand to lose absolutely nothing from the addition of a new gameplay mode.
---
oh im not complaining at all about Country Roads being in the game, i still get excited when it comes on appalacia radio, yeah the Beach Boys soung is a bit out of place,. In my head-canon the cutoff for culture (outside of easter egg type references like ‚ÄúThat Gun‚Äù) is the early to mid 1960‚Äôs, Essentially before the US had any major activity in Vietnam. 
---
I grinded for hours too but I'd like to see some balance in survival mode. If ppl bring their adventure characters over who's to say that they come with tons of duped shit too and ruin that as well?? Op legendary weapons wont make for fun pvp fights so I personally think we should not be able to bring our gear
---
Except that could be remedied by just using other weapons while stockpiling that specific ammo type... if not for their ungodly weight preventing you from doing exactly that even with the weight reduction perk.
---
You ever try to take the SBQ on by yourself?
---
I'm playing on xbox one and the only thing I can do once I enter world is walk and jumps if I try 5o aim It gets stuck and i can't load the pit boy or it will freeze as well 
---
you are right and wrong.... you can hook it to laser trip but you see there is a problem.... you have to be blind to not see the laser trip and you cannot build it very far due to area of camp restrictions so its just doesent makes sense
---
When you lack skills and just pay real money for all the best stuff. Why would you want god mode? Are you scared or something
---
better inventory, text chat, perk loadout manager
---
I understand you say you won‚Äôt take any hand outs. But honestly I have a seven year old that is starting to get into the wasteland just as I am. I‚Äôm +100 and my some just started. Single dad also, and I would greatly appreciate if you would take all my junk and I have max caps that you can take all you want. Like I said this story touches me in the heart. I‚Äôm still in the process of trying to explain the game to my son but so far he‚Äôs grown to like it. Not as much as Fortnite god forbid but still he likes the concept. I‚Äôm about to start a new character for him. Also we are on Xbox, if you are on Xbox I would love to give your kid everything I have. It would give me a chance to start completely over with my son please and thank you.
---
Ive noticed this happens a lot if your foundation is larger then 6x3, only solution ive found is to split up your CAMP into separate smaller areas
---
Not very far, i find it a bit useless tbh.
---
perks?
---
Why don't you just try to play the game?
---
I dont feel like getting bullied today lmao
---
I had a camp spot that always spawned either chickens frogs possoms or foxes every time I was there
---
Chicken soup, fox jerky, frog legs, and possum on a stick FTW!
---
Getting socks for christmas is the bees knees.
---
My camp is at top of the world and i manage to do a strike on those cabins. It would be nice if they could reach whitesprings for example
---
It's for NPCs though I think, they trigger the laser trips and don't avoid pressure plates etc, just like turrets target them and not players (until hostile).
---
Huh?
---
It's letting you CARRY more.
---
Short answer is that it is impossible. You will never be an unstoppable juggernaut. 
---
Well if you buy everything, it's pretty obvious that the game itself is getting boring. 
---
i'm lvl 85 and i have found only a pair of two shot and  one explosive. I also not finished the main story yet and have only a t-51 PA.
---
This is a game where you have to take your time, nobody forces you to have everything right now and trading for things is the best way to get bored very soon. 
---
Create a new sim and earn the best weapons and armor in the game.
---
Just capturing the top comment to say, if you should witness such behavior, misogynistic or anti-gay or whatever, it is important that you don't keep silent. Speak out, tell them to shut up.
---
It's not that the victim of such harrassment cannot defend themselves, it is about showing force, making those assholes see that they are not part of the majority and that they are standing outside of the community.
---
yeah but the topic is just to increase their volume for area not changing or making them different in use
---
What does the Detailed Map mod do?
---
Said Todd, when community managers asked him if he was going to start tweeting again!
---
Crash to desktop and several server disconnects for me last night/ this morning. 
---
Once I got stuck in vats (couldn't tab out) 
---
Stuck in my power armor a few times. 
---
That last one is something new,  just started happening the last few days. 
---
Escape artist perk is much more useful for pve only costs 1 point as well.
---
Chameleon mutation is only decent for pvp, as it completely hides you from other players, your only noticeable by a shimmering outline which is very hard to see, but this requires weightless legendary armour so you dont get the negative effect of the mutation.
---
I've done that one a few times, maybe I just kill him to fast and don't hear the beep. I will definitely listen and look for him next time. Thank you for the information.
---
Perk loadout manager, the only one that i need.
---
Only in blast zones? The stuttering, lag and disconnects outside of it are okay then?
---
That's the thing though, while you are within that 200m radius of your camp the game will at times randomly spawn NPCs to attack it, SMs or scorched or robots etc. Outside that it doesn't do it, thats what it is for, you want to increase the range to attract people, so you kind of do want to change its use...Either way, yes it would be cool.. 
---
Another nuke at prime spawns another queen
---
Wow that fight must have given borderline ptsd bc yes i remember. How? No clue.
---
I'm a high AP build. Not for vats but for movement and sprinting. I'm rockin 2 custom fitted heavy buttressed raider legs which reduce ap cost when running so I can stay pretty mobile and escape most fights I cant win
---
Yeah in slap dmg. They cant one shot you atleast i thought they couldn't 
---
A man goes to his Doctor and says, "Doctor, It hurts when I lift my arm"  
---
The Doctor says, "Well that's easy to remedy, don't lift your arm then."  
---
If something bothers you when you look at it, don't look at it.  
---
Your point is understood though, but as to why it bothers you so much, is beyond me.
---
Theres a reason why shotguns and rifles are specifically classified as 2 different things in the game
---
You can hit it again, up to three times in one server. My friends and I do it all the time. When we kill her three times in one server, we hop onto another one and do it three times again. Repeat process until we're bored or we run out of times we can launch.
---
They seem quite happy to be planning a conservatory though.
---
Yep. Same here. 
---
A hyperchondriac perk!
---
The perk you are looking for is called Enforcer, and it is under the agility tree. Hope this helps :)
---
Mine reaches from my camp at Solomon's Pond to the Whitespring employee parking lot &amp; laundry building: [Video](https://youtu.be/Wdcn5nsLPVk). Range ends just short of the doorway of the golf clubhouse, about where the chain link fence separates it from the tennis court.
---
Yea you sound like a pvper that would do that to a kid. At some point you have to draw the line and throw away the game rules and come back to reality. Your not a character roaming the wasteland, your a human being, and when it comes to kids especially trying to keep the lifestyle alive you show sympathy. Regardless of your gameplay and rules. 
---
Maybe but how do I know that person is still on the server it could be free loot that's going to waste if I don't take and will die with the server when it restarts. There are no names attached to the bags, I actually take more randomly found death bags than bounty bags, especially if it's a lower level bounty. Poor bastard probably doesn't know about pacifist and accidentally shot a player or player structure, kill them leave there bag along and let them play again with the ability to see players on the map again.
---
That doesn't mean it must have to do with strenght.
---
Carrying more is often achived by packing and loading it more efficiently. 
---
Odds are you or one of your team didn't have pacifist on and had struck them and/or had claimed a workshop and thus were pvp flagged.
---
About 50 feet in any direction.
---
What is it???
---
Gee, I wonder why someone who has only played for 2 hours doesn't have the same opinion of 'There is nothing to do I am bored' as everyone else.
---
Lol, no amount of efficient packing is going to reduce WEIGHT
---
I just recently had to block a guy who was pretty clingy and needy. I'd share more details, but I'm worried about him having an account and seeing this and revealing himself. Regardless, he made me really uncomfortable and it was disappointing because I did enjoy playing fo76 with him!
---
PSA: Guys, if you come across any girls on a game, keep it in your pants and just treat us like we're other human beings. I personally really hate playing by myself, but at this point I feel like I have to cause all of my other friends have stopped playing, and it's rare (IN MY EXPERIENCE) to run into a guy who just wants to play the game and have a chill, fun time.
---
Hahah you are probably right there, no wonder no one has seen or heard from him
---
You need specific armor to even be able to use it which sucks the most. I can't even use it while wearing my hazmat suit making it totally pointless for me. 
---
How long does it take to get to the "*there is nothing to do I am bored*" part of the game? I just got a comment telling me: "*I'm level 80 and there's just nothing to do anymore!*", which is something above my comprehension because if you've played 30-50 hours of a game, it's only natural to assume that you'll not have much to do anymore.
---
It's really not that bad. I run bandolier as well as ammo weight is a non issue. I also run around with a couple thousand round of 50 cal and 5mm ammo so I kind of need. . 
---
Pretty sure I was in that lobby, too bad I was under lvl 20.
---
Real money? 
---
This guy/gal is offering caps not cash. 
---
depending on the area in game siren would spawn some random units but also as a siren it needs just to be heard ... just like a siren... so when somone is passing ( example on my camp ) im on the cliff next to harpers ferry you can see the whole city from it and from the city you can see in zoom the tower of siren but you cannot hear it... thats my problem 
---
Did you send in an appeal to the email saying you got suspended? It took me a week to get a response saying they will decide my fate in 7-10 days. Check email. 
---
And here I am having trouble moving/scrapping stairs and placing walls with the correct side facing out
---
Move some of your special points into Endurance and spend your caps on some decent armour. 
---
The stuttering / rubberbanding and the random change of facing direction on stairs has made me put the game on hold for now. Even contacted Beth Support and they sent me ahead to the developers but I havent heard anything in ten days now...
---
Really annoying when you actually really want to play
---
Personally i think the weight from all that cash he grabbed is weighing him down and keeping him from reaching the keyboard / screen.
---
Just hope he works out how to horde it all and tweet about the next big game hes making, other wise it might not be as successful as FO76!
---
And I can't believe people are just 'delete the folder' without even mentioning about cleaning up the registry or any associated steps.
---
Welcome, fellow vault dweller
---
You/they have to consider other camps though, 5 camps around Harper's, who's is going off....
---
Yup, I still cant figure out how to flip the walls around
---
Playing yesterday and started to pick up loot I thought someone dumped to reduce weight when suddenly they hit me. I stopped and dropped what I had picked up once I realized it was a death bag. I wish there was a way to tell the difference. 
---
Those 80 sleepingbag designs won't reskin themselves.
---
Overhangs!! Yes!
---
&gt; Yea you sound like a pvper that would do that to a kid.
---
Already mentioned that I wouldn't do that. So thanks for falsely accusing me of being capable of doing something like that.
---
i dont ask about massive volume burst just a slight small fume of sound from far away that will indicate that siren is nearby nothing more nothing less
---
This game is an always-online loot&amp;shoot grinder with microtransactions. Stop looking at it like a single player game where 'I payed $60 and got 20 hours so it's a good deal' and look at objectively as a game design failure from Bethesda. This genre monetises the fact that players will keep logging back on (evidenced by the repeatable quests and randomised loot drops), and they have failed at that. The gameplay loop is shallow and uninteresting, the 'endgame' is incredibly one dimensional. This game is utter garbage in the same way a fighting game with nice backgrounds and a compelling storyline but awful hitboxes and input lag is a garbage game.
---
If you're enjoying it that's all that counts.
---
It'll never happen my friend, I am just telling you why...I know why/how you want it :-)
---
All weight reducing perks should be under strength. 
---
&gt; the game has only been out for a few months
---
It's only been a few:
---
* Days
---
* Weeks
---
* Months
---
&lt;&lt;&lt;---YOU ARE HERE---&gt;&gt;&gt;
---
* Years
---
We all know how to manually delete a file.. this is about the fact that the game still wont let you purely uninstall for the control panel . 
---
Lol remember the corpse runs....so glad those days are behind me.
---
For those not familiar to EQ in those days when you died you dropped everything you had on you so you had to run naked back to the bottom if a very large duegeon to get your stuff back.
---
If you logged off all your stuff was go e forever. It could sometime take you hrs to get help to get your stuff back. It was horrible.
---
well instead of telling me something that i dont know call me out please beacuse seems that i dont know what are you talking about
---
\# of clicks to get to where you want to be is actually a very serious consideration in UX design. So yes, seriously.
---
I am currently 470 hours into play time, I ran out of things to do around the 250 hour mark, only meaningful actions im taking at the moment is finding all the plans in game and the super rare outfits. 
---
The occasional nuke on fissure prime is sometimes fun, plus you can get some mutation plans off the SBQ.
---
You can make an alt with a different build which changes up things a bit, like my main is full heavy gun build with power armour, and my alt is stealth sniper build, makes for a different approach when engaging in combat.
---
I'm only really playing at the moment because I have nothing else to play until Anthem is released.
---
You‚Äôre coming across a little ‚Äònice guy‚Äô there dude. No-one is owed anything for being pleasant and treating each other equally, it‚Äôs just the way it should be. Simple, no reward.
---
"Here ya go son, you hit revenge, then sneak up while I'm distracting him."
---
"Good job boy, now hit space bar over and over to tea bag."
---
Uhm.. I hate to tell you, but I think you misunderstand. You can make a nice cat steak though...
---
I found a furious combat knife last night and I almost cried.  
---
Honestly though, someone gets a good drop somewhere. We need an auction house.
---
As a result I have to expand the rooms of my camp to fix it.
---
She was aggro'd onto a player who disconnected.
---
I‚Äôve found if you store the wall then place it again and before confirming its position slowly walk backward and move your focus point downwards the wall will flip to the direction you want it. It‚Äôs a pain but I‚Äôve been 98% successful. 
---
Another method is if possible remove the floor piece from the opposite side so it thinks you‚Äôre placing an outside wall. 
---
It's pretty much a single player game as Bethesda said from the start that you are not supposed to be seeing other players frequently. Something between single player (because there's a story) and multiplayer seems to be the right way to describe it.  
---
I haven't seen another player yet, so if this issupposed to be a "*traditional multiplayer game*", then yeah, it failed completely in that aspect. Based on the developers own words, it's safe to assume it isn't, though.  
---
Fallout 4/Skyrim is also monetized pretty much the same way (*worse, I'd say, Creation Club sucks*), also both have stupidly boring repeatable quests.  
---
Right now the gameplay seems just as "shallow and uninteresting" as Fallout 4, but without NPCs and a way better world/world building. Can't say anything about the 'endgame', though.
---
You do realize none of those are even a bit close to harassing a child to the point of tears, right?
---
Oh trust me I'm the farthest thing from a nice guy. In fact I'm probably one of the most "asshole" people you'd meet. It's not the way it should be. No reason to make any effort toward anyone unless they are relevant or beneficial to your life. And it is precisely because nothing is owed that nobody should ever feel obligated to care about any of this stuff. It's good that men are starting to shun all these little expectations piled on them by society. Man up? No. Do it yourself.
---
Nice.
---
The riverside between the Nuka Cola plant and Sunshine Meadows Industrial Farm is one of my favorite areas.  My camp is on the river directly across from Sunshine meadows at the bend. 
---
 Press install and choose the same location, it will detect the old installation
---
I‚Äôve put in tons of hours and would love a soft reset. You don‚Äôt have to play the new sever if you don‚Äôt want to. A soft reset would solve many issues that people are having with this game right now. If it‚Äôs a true survival mode everyone should start on even ground. There is absolutely ZERO point for leaderboards otherwise. None, zip, zilch. What are we competing for? What are you in the lead of? Who‚Äôs griefed the most low level people wearing fully outfitted legendary 3* duped gear? Is it s level race? Nope because that‚Äôs done.. so what? Leaderboards are a common feature of seasonally dedicated servers that always soft reset in these types of games. Absolutely zero reason to play the mode otherwise. 
---
Wow you‚Äôre an unbelievable fuckwit
---
The game is a PEGI 18, maybe kids shouldn't be playing it.
---
You tried playing with friends? Or making friends on the game? 
---
I never, ever do that. Like Psyker, my game experience with 76 specifically, has been great. Mostly. But... the discords ive joined to find more people to play with? Not as much.
---
In any case, its easy to say all that "stand up" stuff, and significantly harder to do it. We are such a minority in the community, most of us don't want to make waves or deal with drama. Its easier to re-log and move on. 
---
It's not on us to tell people to not be dicks. It's on them to not be dicks in the first place. I shouldn't have to be aggressive just because someone is being an idiot. 
---
I know but it's still griefing and nothing more. All of my examples are also selfish, toxic or griefer behavior so it deserves the same kind of treatment if nobody seem to care about naming and shaming on this sub.
---
As a level 230 i would totally answer these calls for help especially for lower level players, it would improve interaction between players and help those out that are just starting.
---
On the downside it could potentially be used for greifing, luring players into a trap or such. 
---
Obligatory - Because Bethesda knew how terrible the game was and never expected anyone to play long enough to get there.
---
Good luck killing 3 mobs and be out of ammo haha
---
welcome to fallout ! thats what we need a call for help that can be also a trap pure interaction player vs player... we dont need rusting flare guns on chests tho
---
&gt;It's pretty much a single player game as Bethesda said from the start that you are not supposed to be seeing other players frequently. 
---
Todd Howard literally said the best way to play was with other people.
---
&gt;Something between single player (because there's a story) and multiplayer seems to be the right way to describe it.
---
Having a story doesn't make it a single player game. The *ability* to play it alone does not make it single player. You could play World of Warcraft without ever interacting with another person, but that is definitely not a single player game.
---
&gt;Fallout 4/Skyrim is also monetized pretty much the same way (worse, I'd say, Creation Club sucks), also both have stupidly boring repeatable quests.
---
Not at all. They have definitive end states for the World. A benefit of being a single player game is player impact being realised. Ever booted up an old Skyrim save and found that Alduin is alive again? Ever booted up Fallout 4 and found that the Institute hasn't been blown up by the BoS or vice versa?
---
&gt;Right now the gameplay seems just as "shallow and uninteresting" as Fallout 4, but without NPCs and a way better world/world building.
---
This doesn't sound like a very compelling review. 'Just like Fallout 4 which was pretty average'.
---
Wendigos are tough?
---
Sorry but if your argument is that 'playing with friends makes it better' then I have some bad news for you. Rolling around in shit is more fun with friends.
---
I‚Äôm deeply disappointed this wasn‚Äôt an IRL confession. 
---
I killed my first wendigo in the wendigo cave for Rose's quest. I got into power armor and took every psycho and psycho related drug i had, which was alot. Took me 4 hits to kill it with the black diamond 
---
It seems like their range is just insanely small, like a foot radius.
---
Maybe I'm high but wtf is this lolol
---
Great idea bethesda needs to see this. 
---
This number is useless when 80% of ppl left on launch
---
Jay and Silent Bob made it widespread
---
Dying is part of living.
---
I'm not that  high level I don't have time to level up like a fiend sadly! Wish I was  level 455 but I'm only 33.
---
What‚Äôs the negative effect of chameleon? There‚Äôs nothing listed. 
---
&gt;This doesn't sound like a very compelling review. 'Just like Fallout 4 which was pretty average'.
---
Exactly. I'm not arguing that it's a great game (don't have enough playtime yet), just that it isn't the utter garbage people on the web make it to be.
---
OTHER than Bethesda is what he meant lol
---
You don't have to kill all of them.
---
Get hacker 3 and make them fight each other by hacking the terminals.
---
You also don't have to repair the reactor if you have hacker 3 and can find the corresponding terminal.
---
I really hope there is a massive revolutionary year 2 patch. Id be fine with it going f2p as well to add players, and give owners some type of compensation 
---
How do u get that many caps please tell me. I never can get enough caps to u have some method or exploit or a video u could show me
---
Get a team and teammates.  
---
Most ppl in your shoes have been raging its a waste and to not even mess with their pve experience at all, glad to see your atleast open to it!
---
You could give me one of your good weapons out of the kindness of your heart. That might make u happy
---
Fallout 4 was released 3 years before Fallout 76. If there is no innovation except in textures and map size then that pretty much is utter garbage. The hallmark of a stagnating development studio that has run out of ideas.
---
What does it spell for TES:6? Skyrim but prettier?
---
What does it spell for Starfield? A brand new IP from a studio dry of ideas?
---
Awsome have fun man.
---
you cant wear any armour for it to work. the weightless legendary perk negates it, allows you to wear armour with that legendary effect.
---
This is a straw man argument.  Moreover, it's laughable in your disproportionate scale of examples.
---
The whole of FO76 is endgame content, because at this rate, the game will soon end.
---
Awesome!! I‚Äôm going to try this ASAP!
---
Whoever plays more will have the advantage no matter what
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs not a negative effect of the mutation, but I get what you‚Äôre saying. 
---
Outrage culture is a thing. 
---
There's certainly a fair about that you could dislike about it but if it's not a problem for you, it's not a bad game for like the $20-30 price point.
---
It's just a shame that the embarrassing terrible launch this game went through distracts from some really cool story moments and voice acting in the game.
---
If your leaving and your on Xbox could u help a low level out and give me your good TSE shotgun 
---
I have one weapon stored and the rest is scrap in my stash If you need anything. Xbox
---
Depends on how good a kid can handle things that happen in a game that's rated above their age.
---
Dev room
---
Did you have control of any workshops?
---
Flatwoods monster maybe.
---
The flatwoods monster is an alien, and you can find the alien blaster in game as well
---
Weight managment simulator 2019 gets a little old, 
---
It's not a bad idea in an ideal world. 
---
Given how some people act in high danger areas, it's more a calling card to pick up some free junk.
---
My experience has been more often than not, rather than save you, people will just wait around until you die so they can take your junk. 
---
Dog eat dog world.
---
Its short range and too slow to fire to be of any use. You could move your camp near a nuke sure for the turrets and have\use the artillery.... Buts slow as hell and as soon as you throw a smoke out it across enemies.
---
Better of just making orbital strikes.
---
Lol, each of the platforms have toxic players and griefers. PC isn't special.
---
This mode gets us a bit closer to rust for sure and I'm all about it
---
Wear power armor. It's not perfect, but it sure helps.
---
None.
---
Wait til march??
---
Do you really believe there's no innovation from Fallout 4 from Fallout 76? Also, watch [this maybe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi8PTAJ2Hjs). Gave me a great perspective on the challenge of getting 76 to work on the creation engine.  
---
And I'm not entirely sure, but I vaguely remember Todd saying on E3 (I guess) that FO76 is supposed to be "an experiment", they are "trying something new", not necessarily putting out a brand new sequel to the Fallout franchise.
---
Guys writes to complain about the game crashing after putting in the work fighting 3 star legendary (essencially the toughest things in the game?) and the community just critisises him for getting killed, amazing ¬¨¬¨
---
Oh yeah, I know, I just wanted to say I find the fire axe useful, but your original point is spot on 
---
Skills.....skills.....oh wait, the drops are terrible. I have a full unyielding set. Thousands of murders to get my set but it must have been my "skills" that made the armor drop. 
---
I managed to dig there once when the Swarm of Suitors event was live but it's never worked since.
---
but at that situation you have no other options low ammo and one flare ... what is there to lose ? i will die anyway
---
so there is no greenskins 
---
For whatever you did I hope so!!
---
&gt; Do you really believe there's no innovation from Fallout 4 from Fallout 76?
---
Only what I took from your statements. 
---
&gt;I'm amazed with how detailed the locations in this game are compared to Fallout 4
---
And then on top of that the combat systems and game mechanics are all the same as Fallout 4. Hell the atom store content is a straight lift &amp; drop from Fallout 4 assets.
---
&gt;Gave me a great perspective on the challenge of getting 76 to work on the creation engine.
---
Todd Howard on the Creation Engine:
---
&gt;We like our editor. It allows us to create worlds really fast and the modders know it really well. There are some elementary ways we create our games and that will continue because that lets us be efficient and we think it works best.
---
Also the L1 and R1 when you go into map don't fit along with the far right and far left screen are hidden from view. I've tried every screen ratio to no avail.
---
Enjoy what you want to enjoy mang, not what some clickbait YouTuber says is fun.
---
No. Unfortunetly. And it will just sit sit your camp it won't follow you around. Most people tame agresive creatures like deathclaws and Mierlucks that actually defend your base. Forgot to mention that the pet will use camp budget equivelent to 1 small turret. In order to tame it it needs to be half your lever or lower. And you probably need to server hop a lot until you find one of decent lvl. It really doesn't work with any animal, it needs to bd a random encounter. I found the place where the Nanny robot that tells you story spawns. And sometime it spawned a radtoad instead of her. Other tines a deathclaw, etc. Then found out their walking path from that place. Those are random encounters.
---
found the guy thats still mad they made soldier 76 gay.
---
Yeah but don‚Äôt you need those to craft potions of invisibility? Or is it potions of fortify illusion?
---
Two shot glitches out on pistol VATS anyway and you miss so many shots. I use an anti armour western revolver so it doesn't really affect me. You are right though. The nerf to TS is just stupid when explosive is the real issue.
---
Pete and Todd are with Shelly Miscavige somewhere in Mexico
---
30-50 hours that's cute, more like 400 hours thus far and I'm not bored. There's plenty to do. Dailey's and events need some work but are fun. Farming for those perfect legendaries. Finding the all elusive ulracite jet pack plan. I don't get all the butthurt over FO76 either, I had 400 fun hours and looking forward to another 400 hours of fun.
---
These "I hit endgame and what now' posts are yin and yang with the 'i just got F76 and yeah its buggy and i crash a lot but why all the hate' posts
---
Even if it makes it easier to power level another player, it's not like they can't just tag mobs to do the exact same thing. Kill share radius could be equal to the radius of rad sponge team medic and such. 
---

Regardless of whether the Devs didn't think of people hitting 100 quick or not, people would....plain and simple, so you plan ahead and do it for those that will. Right now it's knee jerk reaction planning....oh dam, didn't think of that....fix it, instead it should have been, oh, wait...they're going to hit 100, so make the text smaller and the box bigger. What happens in a few years (If the game lasts that long!) when people reach 1000? We simply won't have a clue what levels are on a map.
---
Theyll fix it in the July patch
---
Yea, as is a problem with most online only games, don‚Äôt have an online service or the servers are down, can‚Äôt play this game that you payed money for.
---
Also as I said before, a lot of the issues I‚Äôve seen are related to being online and an offline mode would make 90% of them fixed for those players.
---
Such as enemies having random aneurysms, disconnects, lag, greifers etc. 
---
Please don‚Äôt do that. The more that‚Äôs built the more costly they are to take. I had to pay 100 caps to take one because some twit built like 10 turrets around the bench. 
---
I live at Harpers and can hit almost the whole town. It‚Äôs super fun and I use it everyday :) 
---
They're from zeta reticuli, they prefer to be called zetans. Sheesh! 
---
Doesnt quite work for me, I needed a second set of stairs to add floors t to act as an interior ceiling, still, only two walls face the wrong way lol
---
I agree this seems like some decent balancing that's needed
---
In all seriousness; there‚Äôs an achievement / trophy for getting to level 100 so it‚Äôs not as if BGS didn‚Äôt expect people to get there...
---
It means that somebody nearby is a high level.
---
I just built a bed and breakfast near my favorite cat today üòª
---
I'ts much better than it was 10+ years ago. I'll take that. My gamertag is very girlie and I play as a female. It's been happening as long as I can remember. I'm not saying it's okay, but it's not impossible to take the extra step to ignore these weirdos. Let's be honest. I know we "shouldn't have to" but that's gaming and not something that's new. This conversation is old. 
---
What locations are you grinding ? Try Camden and the nuke cola factory, anything om the west side should be fine, including Flatwoods. Camden has some enemies around 14 - 32.
---
...and a golden Pip-Boy?
---
You're too far east or south. If you look at the map you can see the different areas by the way they are colored. These different regions have different level caps. If you go up north to the white area (toxic valley) I think the level cap is twenty. But watch out for the anglers. They are tough.
---
North and south of the forest.  If you enter the Savage Divide you run the risk of hitting a zone where a high level player went through.  The spawns will be based of their level.  
---
Not to say that‚Äôs not doable if you just watch your map to see where folks are.
---
all of my xbox duped items are listed on lemonparty .com, take a look

I did a 1,000,000 run. At about 100 got a TSE 3sar Plasma Gatling, at about 250,000 got a TSE 2 star handmade, at about 500,000 I spotted my dream Anti-armor, swing speed, +40%pwr atk Gaxe,

I set this off and kind of forgot about it about at 600k (when I went to bed that night...) and just found the tabs with the above comment, when cleaning up my tabs from the week... 
---
Well, that was fun lol
---
Incomplete game
---
hahahaa ok... so only flatwoods monster
---
https://cdn.gearnuke.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/fallout-76-zone-map-level-range.png
---
Start in the forest and explore everywhere. Clean out all the locations you can. Sort of spiraling out from the vault is one way to do it - head northwest first and follow the road, going to all the map markers you find. Wind down to point pleasant, then keep going to Camden Park, and all those. Wrap back around heading north to the giant teapot, keep going, follow the road towards Sutton, then on into the toxic valley.
---
Do the same thing with toxic valley. I recommend getting the tourism quest from the Grafton mayor and completing it by walking to the locations. Again follow the roads and stop wherever you see something interesting.
---
Remember to sleep in beds for extra 5 percent XP. It adds up quick.
---
Once done with Grafton you can head to the ash heap. There will be more difficult enemies off and on here, but you should be around level 30 easily by this point. Ash Heap will level you up even if you just run past discovering locations.
---
Then do Savage Divide. The issue with the Savage Divide is that the enemies don't seem to have level caps like they do in the forest or toxic valley. So you can easily run into level 60 charred feral ghouls your first trip there.
---
I'm kinda bored but not due to a lack of content there's tons of story and stuff to find but it's the feeling you're making forward progress on anything in particular. 
---
It's like there should be that area I don't go to or the big monster I still can't kill even though I'm level 250. The difficulty goes out the window eventually. If you get power armor early then that may come sooner.
---
Enemies will still be a pain to kill because of balance issues but they aren't challenging anymore and the rewarding feeling you get eventually fades. May just be me tho I doubt it :3
---
But corporate needs the $$$
---
Nice job decorating :) 
---
lol I think so. I imagine they'll come eventually but not until a big dlc. Would be cool to get abducted by the same ship that takes you in fallout 3
---
cool thanks !
---
This isnt a traditional fallout game tho, stories and quests in this game aren't what they were in fallout4 which was a hardcore downgrade from the quests and stories from fallout3 and new vegas. There was 1% the dialogue options of past titles and this has even less.. go to quest marker press X is not a quest. This has a heavy focus on multiplayer interaction not solo quest stuff. I get the need for content but this wont ever be a normal story driven fallout. Look at other mmo style games like this that have no real story bit huge worlds for ppl to grind away n fight n start all o e again. I'm sure we will get more gameplay loops but not as in traditional story or quests I believe
---
Nice! Also reminds me of [this Mr. Bean scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmbmNp1RDCE).
---
If you die without anyone around, you at least have the chance to reclaim your junk. Guess it depends on what's more important to you - not dying or getting your junk back.

It's very likely that that's what happened
---
Why even bother with PvP content, when the 5% you mentioned in your post will soon leave for The Division 2???
---
This guy fucks!
---
Who is surprised anymore...
---
&gt; I'm only really playing at the moment because I have nothing else to play until Anthem is released.
---
From the previews it seems Anthem will bore you even harder, and much sooner.
---
Or have a double sided interior wall.
---
Yeah, with 3 only.
---
I found that location in a daily mission with Vox Syringer. Accidentally I killed a cat and I felt so bad :c if I think about it I could cry 
---
It's a shitty thing to do.  But at the same time it's an online game rated 18+.  You can't expect people to play nice in this setting.  Also it was your fault for not having pacifist mode on.   
---
I sometimes play fallout with my nephew.  But he knows the deal with online games.    I'm sorry but you need to be a bit tougher.   This isn't a moderated Minecraft server, this is an apolcalyptic wasteland.  I'm surprised coming from Minecraft you haven't had this happen before.
---
It doesn't excuse the guy being a jackass still, fallout is rated 18+
---
Lack of content, bugs, stripping almost everything that makes Fallout Fallout (human NPCs, choices during questlines, dialogue) and of course Bethesdas terrible business practices.
---
its ok, the first step is admitting you have a problem, were here for you, stay strong.
---
So romantic \*\~swooons\~\*
---
I'm sure pve balancing/refinement is coming as well in march
---
It's either that or more storage space, you can't have both

Wow, my strength is maxed 15 and I have ordinance express card equipped, didn‚Äôt know the 1/10 weight existed but that‚Äôs now my life‚Äôs goal. Thank you a boat load I‚Äôm on PS4 my name is hillbilly202 an if I could ever help you in-world just holler. Thank you for the knowledge, this subreddit is saving FO76 I do love this buggy ass game. 
---
That doesn't always work. I've managed to get my CAMP stuck with just one floating set of stairs after deleting everything else, and it won't let me delete it.
---
He's too busy choppin that meat.
---
If the endgame in Fallout 76 is so boring and empty, why do I keep coming back and can't stop playing? 310 hours in, hardly ever go into blast zones, haven't seen a scorchbeast queen yet, level 125, pacifist mode. What is wrong with me?
---
From one father to another that sounds really pathetic. What are you teaching your kid? I understand the limited time with the kid. I understand wanting to have fun during that limited time. However, there is a huge teachable moment in that experience. The biggest teachable moment is that it is a video game! What matters is the time you spent having fun. Teach your kid not to let other people‚Äôs action cause him so much emotional strain. 
---
Talk to him about rebuilding, about how that other player cannot take away your fun, make so e new plans on how to play together to deter these kind of players. 
---
Your reaction is how your kid is going to learn to deal with this stuff. You are modeling behavior. Your reaction is to come on Reddit and cry about griefers and how they ruined everything. 
---
Buy a different game.

Because you haven't paid them 500 Atoms for the privilege to do so.

Or in other words: "Hey ladies, I'm a sensitive gamer who totally cares about your feelings. And because I know how helpless you are in the world please listen to my genuine male wisdom on how you should react to abuse. I totally respect women but I just know that you're lost without me. Let me save you to give my life some meaning or at least let me collect some social justice upvotes for my ego."
---
Just cringy...
---
High level enemies are good for leveling up. Just stand on top of something every time you encounter anything without a gun. 
---
Other than that just stay in the forest.bi can barely go there cause everything is 200 levels beneath me. Sucks cause it's a huge area I wanna keep exploring. 
---
Also tip if you see the event "Feed the people". Do the event. its at morgantown in the mama dolce factory.
---
Its about 10 mins long but will give you 5 consumables that give you 5% xp for 1 hour.
---
So bed + this will give you 10% xp boost for a big amount of time!
---
My guess the game is meant to level cap at 50 but some one said no to that. And they never fixed the map view.

Point Pleasant, and you'll make a LOT of caps if you farm the Mothman Eggs there and turn them into omelets
---
&gt;more items to put on shelves 
---
So much, in singleplayer you could at least put every item on them even though they usually fell down but the shelves make no sense in fo76 :/
---
They are gonna create artificial rarity with that skin.  
---
New Vegas was release few years after 3 and no innovations in 76? Really what about multiplayer which this company never had experience with before?

Being a dev for a web service or frankly any type of service or application is vastly different from being a dev for a triple A game. It‚Äôs not just changing a database around, that‚Äôs newbie stuff that doesn‚Äôt change game structure besides already present data. 
---
This PvP mode will require ground up code reform. Rewriting entire functions, writing new queue and matchmaking network code, etc etc. Theres a lot to be worked on and if you‚Äôd ever worked on a video game title of any significance you‚Äôd know this, and as a dev you should know that your code and application environment is vastly different from the code and application environment of a video game, and most other software. I‚Äôm guessing you‚Äôre a web dev
---
Power Armor and this one perk...forget what it's called but it's under Agility and it's where when your health is low you will automatically use a Stimpak. 
---
Add Pharma Farma from Luck to stock up on Stimpaks and you should be golden!
---
I very rarely die with this method. 
---
Additionally, you'll want to be sure you've leveled up enough for the area you're in. If you haven't explored a ton of the forest and a ton of the toxic valley and at least a little bit of the Ash heap, get out of the Savage Divide and do a little grinding first. Helps oodles.
---
YES to dungeons and end game stuff like that. But put automatic LFG engines and still allow us to play solo. No need for guilds and sh**.
---
I mean it's not the free bullets that entice me it's the extra damage. I'd probably still use TS if it took two bullets. His idea isn't all that bad. Maybe mg42 wouldn't be so terrible if it didn't chew through a rare ammo for almost no benefits
---
Yeah, I have Escape Artist, it's a lifesaver. I was talking about Chameleon as the legendary armor effect, rather than the mutation. The mutation seems entirely pointless for PvE, yeah.
---
you 're right !
---
Early on the game is great. Plenty to do and explore.
---
Then you hit the endgame wall right around level 100. Then it becomes a wieght management simulator and perk card swapping solitaire.
---
The rewards for completing end game content are very often complete garbage. And should you be misfortunate enough to use guns, the hours and hours you will need to spend stockpiling ammo and supplies to repeat the same stale process again.
---
Enjoy your early game now. But the bitterness will come.
---
I have a trip wire right in front of a terminal that opens and closes my garage door... If someone tries to activate the terminal they will hit the trip wire and turn the siren on :)
---
yes but that situational im reminding you that we are talking here about volume of siren not mechanics to use it...
---
where abouts is this fountain, i heard of it last week but have not been able to locate it
---
Op.... Never farm for ammo. Farm for leave unless you can keep scrounger equipped 100% of the time.  Place your camp on a lead reserve or near the fire department and you can check for lead weights each respawn. 
---
I also noticed that the nuke bunkers also have a gym with lead. You take all 4 and you'll have like 500 lead

Me too too . On Xbox . Would be happy to give you some of my loot ..

Why in god‚Äôs name isn‚Äôt there a small chance of me getting orbital beacon/strike grenades for doing Enclave events? They‚Äôre about the only decent bit of new gear the Enclave has. 
---
If you are trying to follow the main quest missions, don't bother at this point.  It takes you to areas where higher level players cause the mobs to be way to high for you.  As other have said, just do missions in the forest and western parts of the map for now.
---
100% this. I have met nothing but kind people in-game. 
---
It has so much potential!
---
could b cool üëçüëç

Letting a group play together is not an innovation to the gameplay experience. If they just released Fallout 4 with group play it would not be innovation. It would be recycling content and expecting the players to create their own new experience from it. That is exactly what Fallout 76 is, play it with friends and figure out your own way to have fun because the studio doesn't know how anymore.
---
I'm glad you're enjoying it but keep in mind that you're playing the game after it had dozens of GBs of patches, hours of maintenance and server-side fixes. Most importantly, you probably didn't pay ‚Ç¨70 (or whatever a full price game costs elsewhere) for it. There's a reason the reviews have bashed the game; it's not like there's a cospiracy against FO76 out there.
---
I'm still having fun since launch day, but I'm absolutely conscious of the fact that it was released in an extremely poor state. You said you've played 2-3 hours: well, I think I've spent that amount of time throughout my 200 hours just trying to get out of world's geometry after, for example, getting stuck between a bench and a wall.
---
Thanks. I was despondent about the endgame of Fo76. I have found my new activity.
---
Crossdressing.
---
Because when you have fuckall left to do in the game, collect pretty clothes to satiate that pretty princess we all have deep inside...
---
Grabbing the control pad (snatching it from an upset child) then, putting mic on (to what speak to the guy nicely or start raging i wonder). 
---
Focusing on the pixels instead of the child and getting more and more irate about it is whats probably made the kid upset, seeing his father ranting and raving and blowing his top over a video game whilst he stands there upset not knowing what's going on.
---
Of course for one second buying another game more age appropriate never entered this guys head, his temper got the better of him and everyone should stop PVP or ask for ID before deciding to PVP in a PVPVE game thats rated R or PEGI 15. 
---
Play's minecraft as well....people mention greifing here when they really mean PVP, Mine craft is the birth place of most actual greifers isnt it?
---
It took me forever to realize you just add a card and the code to launch a nuke. The whole decryption thing confused me. Didn't realize all it was gonna give me the same code you can get online. 
---
Would love a crew to nuke with. Had a tag along once. Was a good time 
---
I have a way worse addiction spilling over from Fo4. I pick up _every_ damn bottle of Nuka Cola (and variants) but I never use them. I have over 250 in weight and long for somewhere to put them on display. 
---
I am thankful that everyone I've played with so far has been really great. I'm the only girl I've run into and all the guys have pretty much just been treating me like they seem to treat everyone else. It's been respectful, and fair, and fun. And I haven't been creeped out or worried. 
---
This sort of behavior definitely does happen in online games in general, but the tricky thing is that not everybody sees it. And, not everyone cares, or pays attention to notice it when it's happening in a more subtle way.   
---
Thankfully we do have the option to block players that are bothering us. 
---
I know, relax. I was merely responding to another comment. I'll be on my way now.
---
Somethings are yellow and other things blue ..
---
Buh hu huu
---
That could be fun as well though, screaming "It's a traaap!" to the group as you try to avoid the fatmen exploding at your feet or the sledgehammer coming towards your face as the loading screen fades away!
---
well you have a point i will give you that but i like to make things simple...siren is loud and its not now...thats it
---
The real question is why is something so trivial yet visible not been fixed 
---
I agree, I started using the 10mm smg and like it but that sight is awful. I was also baffled as to why there's no .308 receiver anymore. So we can downgrade to .38 but not upgrade woot.
---
Sounds good, read in a previous post that you're Swedish. I am too, lvl 22 at the moment. Send me a pm and we'll sort it out! (Min polare jag spelat med spelar knappt l√§ngre) 
---
I‚Äôve killed quite a few 3* around white springs. But every drop from them I‚Äôve ever had is a shitty melee weapon like a hatchet/rolling pin/death tambo etc. I‚Äôve never received a gun from them ever. 
---
Probably bobble exploit then. If you have a shop they can claim it, and that turns you hostile automatically. 
---
Works that way if any teammate owns a shop. 
---
&gt;You said this did you not? I see no reference to another person.

---
I don't wear it but apparently excavator power armor gives u a boost to carry capacity when wearing a full set.
---
X-01 has the highest rad resistants but the T-51 has better ballistic resistants. The excavator has more carry weight, and at the end of the day, it's just a matter of preference.
---
I have this issue too
---
Seriously, after a month it should've been fixed. We're 3 months out and it still isnt fixed, ridiculous. I'll call the game for what it is, a blatant cash grab relying on the fans to carry a half finished product and like Mass Effect they managed to upset/alienate their fanbase. Which is quite sad because like Mass Effect it's a good game under the unfinished nonsense.
---
Yeah.
---
This game needs the vocal minority. Because we are the ones that effect change. The non-vocal "majority" has already fucked off to go play something that doesn't suck and taken their reasons for leaving silently with them contributing nothing for the future improvent of the game.
---
So yeah. Thank god for the vocal minority.
---
Just visited there yesterday and stopped to admire these godlike creatures.
---
Seriously, this is one of the stupidest bugs in the game. It's not that hard to get string length to define the width of a box. It's even easier to just make a wider box that doesn't scale to the string length. Why they didn't create a max level character to test this and set the box width from the get go is beyond me.
---
if you mod it with quad barrel it cut 6 pounds off the weight, no idea why as you would expect it to gain weight.
---
Yup I have this issue too, I still find random logs in different areas that aren‚Äôt highlighted for you to find them. I wonder if you got to find them randomly until you‚Äôve collected them all?
---
Think the science perk makes your energy weapons more durable.. 
---
Yeah I have noticed, bit could just be the nature of RNG.  Having said that for the amount of hours I put in, the rewards are not worth it.  
---
I tend to just look for something I want then grind out caps and buy it from someone.  
---
I don't have a clue what you mean.. 
---
I don't think it goes away for anybody, but not sure. I always thought that we will be following her footsteps in the DLC's too(at least some), because the mission does not end.
---
I crash almost every time I run into a whitesprings nuke.  The SBQ is hit and miss but the performance is always &lt;15 fps
---
Eh, by now he could have seen most everything if he started around launch. I‚Äôve seen most of it, just hit level 70, and usually only play on weekends. The only reason I haven‚Äôt done everything yet is I‚Äôm trying to ration out the story
---
When loading the canisters into the food processor if you mash the button(a on xbox) too fast or get shot while pressing the button a weapon, armor piece, or ammo might pop up in the list with the canisters.    Threw away all 995 bullets ofmy .45 ammo yesterday because of this.
---
About to fast travel outside the silo to watch a Nuke?  Here's 5 missiles!
---
I grow adhesive in bulk by running a camp in the forest and using the fast travel perk to compensate for the distance
---
my mortal enemy however..... is screws..... (eye twitch)
---
If your not the resource farming type, t-60 actually has the cheapest repair costs if you choose not to take that particular perk. 
---
i would love to see number limits on component items, maybe 1024 per item
---
Annihilation. The bear.

I had all three perks on when it broke in under s minute

Te storytelling of 76 is not for ADHD people. You have to stop and look and listen and what's worse, you have to read. Reading is like a punishment for some people these days. 
---
If they can throw in the Beach Boys they could have thrown in some Fleetwood Mac.
---
exactlyüòä
---
As for the others. I couldn't tell u. U use t51 but that's mainly for aesthetic. I think maybe for special paint jobs or mods that u might come across more often for a certain set then another. Idk if that helps but that's what I've noticed.

THANK YOU. Same feeling as all the people that were so excited that lever action got fixed. Servers are still complete shit (still), there are LVL 3's with 60 TSE's, people are buying virtual items for real cash, the story line can be completed in a single day, vendors are broken, events broken, visuals broken... I still tried to find enjoyment in this game after a month. Finally gave in when I was booted twice after latest update then found myself in servers solo for an hour. This game is a piece of shit. If it was a car it would be a bigger scandal than VW
---
ManBearPig. 
---
Lol, maybe don't pay someone else to play your game for you and you'll have more game to play. smh
---
This is a good start. Stay away from high level players as well.
---
i would love to see a new Barrel for missile launchers, single shot and it fires a missile that explodes like a mini nuke, upping the damage to that of a fatman. the projectile could look similar to the davy crockett. (both in flight, and loaded into the barrel)

---
for the sake of "balance" it could change the ammo type to "Mini Nuke Missiles" and you have to craft them you can only craft them if you know the plans for the barrel. each would weigh as much as a mini nuke, possibly requiring.

1 Missile

I get the impression u/zirfeld was referring to bystanders not subjects.

Sigh... we go over this every few weeks.

X-01 is actually not the best armor in the game.  It is extremely well-rounded, but the highest Damage Resistance and Energy Resistance at Level 50 armors, with full Fix-It-Good Perks, is actually the T-51.  Here's a comparison of the X-01 and T-51.

I thought thats what I was hearing. All the way NE  on the map. Hear owl hooting. Couldnt find it though.

Same for me but the issue is not constant. It is very irritating.
---
As a responsible parent, your duty isn't to protect and shield your child from all harm. The greatest thing a parent will do for their child is to teach the child how to one day no longer need them. Your son will encounter more jerks and bullies, in the real world, in his lifetime. The most important thing you can do is teach him how to stand up for himself and not submit to bullying.
---
I don‚Äôt know about you but I‚Äôm more concerned about a level 24 with a 1000 cap bounty than a 247. 
---
If that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre into no judgement
---
If its not duped, you will be fine.
---
I just try to keep on fighting the good fight..
---
i would love a laser pointer sight for hip fire accuracy, don't understand how a long scope makes my hip fire more accurate....
---
I‚Äôd get rid of your bulk you ‚Äúfound‚Äù ;) 
---
There is one simple way to make META less apealing and give chance to diversity. I have learned in other games that TTK has to be fast, so that every weapon can be used against players in PvP. This opens up chances to use different builds, because you don't have to worry if you can kill anyone. 
---
When the game has high TTK it is more important that you have a META build when PvPing. TTK has to be fast with every weapon.
---
Of course, like I said, I have learned this while playing other games, so it is not sure if it would work in FO76, but I don't see any reasons why it wouldn't.
---
You mean like the Left 4 dead witch?
---
Ok I‚Äôll try to get some but I thought you wanted .45 as well
---
Because Raiders don‚Äôt care about Min/Max-ing every possible item. 
---
Thats alot of windows man.... 
---
everytime i try and play this time of day i have had server crashes 
---
The first time I saw them, I legit thought they were 12‚Äôs. My first though was,‚Äùthose poor kids are never going to get out of there.‚Äù  So I tossed on my power armor and fast traveled my level 40 ass down there like I was going to be some hero.  The tables turned pretty quickly. 
---
Fallout is a horror-adventure game. I don't know about you but it loses that scary touch after a while.
---
I've a kid playing this game too. We often team up. It's a great game for chatting and interacting with family and strangers. My son and I live together and see each other every day, so it's a little different to your situation. But I feel for you, as I have 7 kids from ages 26 to 5 years old. If someone did that to my son, I'd grief him back, mind you, I'm level 140 with a TSE sniper combat rifle and full set of Chameleon gear. If you need help, message me. I'm on PS4. I've loads of junk and loads of time to help with just about anything.
---
I genuinely thought it‚Äôd be some kind of joke enemy and I‚Äôd get completely annihilated for killing one like in Zelda Ocarina of Time haha
---
I would think that you‚Äôve modded it too far, but two mags kinda needs to be seen to be believed. 
---
I have an automatic laser rifle (with burning damage) that breaks way too quickly, but not that quickly. 
---
Working as intended.
---
Not a bug.
---
Frustrating as hell. I know. But working as intended.
---
God I wish I could give gold
---
Sees wanted level 24.
---
TPd to vault.
---
Enemy is actually 247.
---
Dies to TSE
---
Yup I agree except I just kill and eat people now and build my reputation as the most prolific serial killer in the wastes!! Bwahah 45 victims and counting!!
---
I farmed until I had 4 I wanted and then just bought the rest on the market sub. They go for as low as 500 caps each. 
---
I accidentally cured one because of a misclick when perk swapping and had to rebuy it yesterday. Painless.

---
We should do any AHS Coven meet up
---
Wow really ?
---
No, Fallout76 is a RPGish, survivalish, shooterish, adventure.
---
Aside from the fact that she might‚Äôve died after recording one (I don‚Äôt think that there‚Äôs a definitive chronology to the tapes), I fully expect to have this quest expanded in future DLC...could be why. 
---
That's a good one, maybe something with the Stranglers in the Mire? Also the Scorched are sort of like that sometimes, they tell you to run or similar, implying that they sometimes don't want to be doing those things
---
It crashes to desktop. 
---
Thats when the Atomic shops implements pulowski preservation shelter.
---
You are nuke proof in those tiny, single person havens of blue goodness.
---
Not for me. Granted, this is the first time I ever play on a Saturday. During the week is fine. 
---
you need to, if you do the enclave quest loading the tape at sugar grove, if you are holding to many tapes it simply will not let you load your mission tape... 
---
everytime i plastic farm near tables the idiot sits down  and animation takes forever
---
Do you have targeting hud for your power armor or use berry mentats?
---
Players show up if they can see it
---
Which will probably require a name relation to the weapon then destroyed when transferring ownership.  Not very straightforward but I'm sure it will be a feature down the road.
---
Go a step deeper with your thoughts...the ‚Äúrobots killed‚Äù stat was either;
---
A) An example of the types of things that Bethesda are tracking without letting us see, or;
---
B) A completely fabricated number. 
---
Hmmmmmmm. 
---
Also encountering this since last update.
---
Have only "tested" In/Around Whitesprings but usually in Power Armor and friend group have had to take time to play other games in hopes of a fix as it's impossible to get anything done currently for me.
---
First CTD bug I've experienced since launch.
---
I could be wrong but the enemies on the western half of the map are level locked and the enemies will scale up in the eastern three zones.
---
That too
---
How many rockets or nukes do you have?
---
Save this for later! Good guide
---
It was pretty cool when you get to hear about the origins of two of them. It reminded me of that Treehouse of Horror with the Beef-squared burger. 
---
Try coming back after 40 hours.  5-6 hours isn't enough to really judge the game..either way.
---
Yes, the X-01 is clearly the best. 
---
For nuke zones. The T-51b is better for everyday use. 
---
Disconnects per hour
---
Explosive Vents dropped
---
Bugs fixed
---
Have you tried bulking things and getting rid of excess junk like having 1k+ steel?
---
I liked a bounty once that was a surprise 117. I strolled right in ready to encourage them to dump their junk. The oh shit moment as I over reacted and beat the snot out of this poor unexpecting player.
---
my thoughts would be,
---
Yeah, pretty much. Just spent maybe almost a hour exploring the Hornwright's Industries story.
---
Then you already farmed enough for the day go play something else or load up a alt
---
Look at this fat cat with nice coasters. I dont even have a coffee table
---
Seems to match my experience but i have not looked into this
---
This is mind boggling. I produced about 2000 minigun ammo on my first run! Perfect for my heavy gunner build
---
Game mods? Nope. Not touching them until they are official!
---
I do not own a Power Armor yet, I‚Äôm level 13. I do not use berry mentats. 
---
Not that i hate it or things like it, just that they have all this "clean" stuff to put in our dirty homes.. Bit convoluted
---
I assume he exited his excavator power armor to make ammo and lost bonus 100 carry weight exploit, then relogged to get the +100 exploit back. Its still no reason to have over 100 cores, you only need to carry 5 to 10, they can't be sold and it just screws over everyone else in PA when people collect 100's more that they could never use.
---
üëè üëè üëè bravo. I couldn't agree more. Its nice to read posts like this. I built my base in White springs i know it runs the biggest risk of griefers and im happy about that. Gives me a reason to kill them üòä. My base was also built in a way that the basement cant be accessed or destroyed by anyone but me. So if they wreck my upper structures its fine i can repair it but everything important to me is always nice and safe. 
---
Ive been in a few exchanges with players already on some of my posts over workshops. Ive been practically called ever name in the book because i use workshops to pvp. Some just don't get fact that workshops is a pvp location it was intended to encourage pvp. Pvp is fun and not everyone bought Fallout76 to just play pve. So if you dont like getting killed in workshops then go to all the other places on the map to find your junk. Its very easy stop being lazy and go explore.
---
Standard stock, hair trigger reciever, and beam splitter nothing else
---
I expected Bethesda to have played DayZ and went, they we can do this with fallout assets. 
---
And that's about 99% of what fallout is
---
I‚Äôm not a very serious gamer. I‚Äôm 25, and the last game I bought was fallout 4.  If I didn‚Äôt have the internet, I wouldn‚Äôt have realized there was much wrong with it  except for bugs that freeze the game/prevent me from grabbing loot. I don‚Äôt think people like me realize the quality difference between this game and games of similar cost because we don‚Äôt play them.
---
I hope your comment was as sarcastic as mine..
---
Ok yours might be a different issue then. There is a bug in the targeting hud and berry mentats that causes CTD. 
---
The storytelling of FO76 is for fans of Fallout. Makes it easy to differentiate between those who are here because of the franchise, and those who are here because it‚Äôs the latest thing. 
---
After a high level player came to me and gave me free stuff (I've met more friendly high levels than mean ones) this could be a great idea.
---
In my queen run last night I got a 1* junkies pipe weapon from an add. 
---
*Compared game to bleeding out*.
---
*Claims there's a laundry list of problems*.
---
Immediately cites one problem that 90% of players won't run into that has zero impact on the core game.
---
I'm not saying they shouldn't fix the game when it has issues, I'm saying they shouldn't cater to only the players that have issues- they've talked about new features and content being released since the beginning of December.
---
It's safe to say that many of us would rather be playing with these new features and content than *use the elevator at the monorail*. Is there even anything there? No. So if there's a laundry list of bugs, then why the fuck did you name that one that has zero impact on pretty much anyone?
---
Sure that'll be $20 kiddo
---
It's just an hipster robot that want's to vape.
---
She didn't die, because after you launch a nuke she records a new tape you can find.
---
1000+ materials, damn son

Yeah, but unfortunately media made it sure that it will never be the latest thing.
---
Yeah I mean that beach boys song came out in what 1964/? A bit late compared to the rest of the music. So yeah might as well

There‚Äôs so much ‚Äúpost-apocalyptic West Virginian‚Äù lore to be found, that you‚Äôll get your money‚Äôs worth without doubt.

Please Bethesda, 
---
Add earplugs for my character with a  +50 Robobrain bullying resistance. 
---
That can‚Äôt be true when the legendary loot tables and vendor plan/mod spawns are literally designed to encourage grinding. 
---
The soft cap is to create an upper bound for a character‚Äôs power level (before gear) to make gear easier to balance.

Gear isn‚Äôt balanced well, but that‚Äôs a separate issue.

"I gave you some items and we shared a few conversations together, we're dating now eh?"

So you have played the game for 2 hours and have had "a few disconnects", think about how god damn annoying that is going to be spread over 60 hours. 
---
276$ For a leather jacket its really cheap. I would be worry about the quality rather than crying about the price.
---
In my country ( üá´üá∑ ) its common sense leather jacket under 300‚Ç¨ can't be good.
---
If you think a 276$ dollar jacket is overpriced just get a life, nerd.
---
Except to duping the rare weapons are all over the place.  Meanwhile legit players are getting shafted.
---
Ah, I knew there was a good reason to kill it. 
---
I haven‚Äôt used the beam splitter (not in FO76 anyway), but maybe that‚Äôs your issue?
---
Seems to me like 4 extra beams might erode your weapon that much faster. 
---
Mods scrapped for Steel
---
Bobble head stacks geater than 10000
---
Nuks cola stacks greater than 10000
---
Items removed from Dev room
---
Am I doing this right?
---
To anyone saying Flatwoods monster, no it's a different challenge.
---
The Aliens are ingame, as is a lot more alien stuff, such as an Alien Blaster recipe.
---
I suspect aliens will be future content, possibly when more TNT domes are released.
---
Thanks for the spoiler. 
---
Umm no? By your own pic x01 has more rad resistance and 1 less energy resistance. 51 has more Dr sure and is cheaper to repair then ultracite but ultracite pa has more Dr.. 
---
In my experience most ppl use x01 and t60. T60 to run around in and x01 for nuke sites.
---
Selling drugs nets me a good bit of caps. I‚Äôm struggling as well. HAD a fair bit of junk on me till douche bags with their TSEs followed my group across the server to stop anything we tried to do. Lost a fair bit of shit. 
---
Different sides of the same cringe coin
---
That's probably because a Wendigo is a kind of ghoul. They are both humans that are altered by radiation and turned feral. One of the only differences is that some of the Wendigo's were cannibals according to the lore in FO76.
---
Do you need all of that junk? I‚Äôve found great success by only storing the junk I need. I run trapper armor, spears and tomahawks, so I only carry the junk needed to make/sustain those. If I need anything else, I‚Äôll scavenge it for the job but not store it.
---
You shouldn't be able to highlight a workshop and see if it is claimed or who has claimed it.
---
This way non PvP players won't be hunted and the PvP aspect would involve another player who actually came to claim that workshop because they need it not because they want to be a troll.
---
That already happens to a sort, quite a few times I've accidentally walked up to super mutants talking thinking it was grahm lol
---
Is that the first time you use it each session? Or just the very first time using it after acquiring it?
---
We can drop her into a synth body.
---
Eh, don't worry about it.
---
Besides when you talk lore about the game you're gonna get spoiled.
---
Do note though: The mission doesn't end when you grab that tape.
---
Store less, either by selling your junk to vendors/players or by not grabbing it in the first place. 
---
If you want to store springs and screws that's fine, but you don't need 500 asbestos or glass. 
---
I built my camp at a little cafe just north of Welch station, it's HELL to build anything but there's a cat named Murgle there that makes it all worthwhile.
---
Still says and does exactly the same as the Original rose though?
---
How does she fit into the lore Bethesda created? She from our Vault or some other place from outside of WV?
---
I personally have enjoyed it since the Beta. It did have a few issues with disconnects very early on, but it was never that bad for me. I think the experience is better on console since imo they're not as picky and just enjoy the game. The game looks great and I personally used a headset with a mic switch, which most serious console players use. 
---
**This subreddit and the Fallout subreddit are just a minority of the people who actually play the game. Most people buy the game and enjoy it without bashing it online** , and Youtubers just want to click bait you for views by calling the game trash and insult Bethesda. 
---
Thanks for letting me know! 
---
I keep farming the bunker thing for the blaster but I can‚Äôt find it, I can only find the plans after getting the ammo for the first time there? So is something wrong, or do I need to wait? And there is more ammo

I don't know, that's just my character.

Isn't this literally her tho from in game?     https://imgur.com/a/EoPZzTj

Happens a fair bit and I have most weapon plans.

You sure?
---
If you‚Äôre on this subreddit much, you‚Äôll see plenty of posts/comments that cite FO4 as their favourite in the franchise. At the very least, it‚Äôs ‚Äòrecency bias‚Äô, and at worst it‚Äôs a bunch of kids giving opinions on a topic they know nothing about. 
---
damn I havent died yet, I‚Äôve been able to farm like level 40 ghouls at whitesprings no problem

Ah right, I thought you'd made a mod or something that's all.

That's what I thought as well!

Hah. Nah, I hate web dev. work. Though I‚Äôve had to pitch in on it from time to time. I don‚Äôt rightly get to have a focus since my job consists of whatever the heck management wants or needs at this time. I also know more than a few people who‚Äôve done game dev. and looked into it myself. 
---
I‚Äôm just looking at the list of changes and see nothing requiring extensive development.
---
The entire *game* needs ground up reworking, but do you honestly believe they will? No, I suspect they‚Äôre just gonna tweak settings and options from the base game, probably already having most of the new features there or semi implemented already and are just doing the code equivalent of flipping switches.
---
What makes you confident they‚Äôre *not* gonna do this in the laziest way possible? This entire game was released in a half finished state and I don‚Äôt expect them to start impressing any time soon.
---
Yeah I bulked all I could. But I‚Äôm always low on steel because I make lots of ammo for myself and fiends, especially using superduper and the one that crafts more ammo. But I have a tonne of gold, wood, bone shards and glass shards.Not sure if I need all of that tho so may need to get rid  of a lot of it. 
---
just as i transition to only using nuka grape....
---
Majority player are long way past the point where they have something to play for. If you have 100 players and 80 are done playing and now 20 are playing, that doesn't mean that playerbase is in spot where they have much to go for. If people were hitting 50 already in Beta, by power leveling then by the end of the opening week most were already done with quests by playing normally, few weeks later they were done with collecting gear.
---
Eh, wrong sarcasm topic. 
---
When you have tens of thousands of players who can't play because the keys are hardcoded, it's a problem. W is next target in VATS / next category in camp? Have fun because it's also the fucking forward key. Q shows/hides camp items you have unlocked, good luck that's the key to move left. 
---
Just follow the quest
---
And then comes the day you max caps. 
---
They work ok, I don't know about great.  I use a pistol for my vats crit build sometimes when I'm low on main ammo and there is a noticeable difference.  
---
I will say finding a double western revolver helped though.  Big difference between 6 and 12 shots for things like Gun-Fu.
---
I completed this, unequipped my armour, outfit &amp; purely wore the clown outfit.  Killed wendy.  For some reason the miscellaneous quest had disappeared from my log. 
---
Now it‚Äôs back but the sense of achievement is already fulfilled.
---
I suggest you get rid of excess junk you never use, i never have used bone shards so i got rid of that entirely. And if you have 1k or 900 or 800 of something you can go a few hundred less you would be able to make them up again

---
*"why would Bethesda do this?"*
---
One hand melee weapons are way more OP than TSE.
---
Bethesda either has a list of 50+ fun weapons, armor, mutations, and perks to nerf..........or get rid of PvP. Unfortunately they seem content to nerf everything.
---
Xbox. Managed to get what I needed, but thanks for the offer.
---
You get 100 for wearing the full excavator set, and can mod it with calibrated shocks for 200 carry weight. Also, theres a bug that if you log in wearing that PA you get an extra 100 carry weight for a total of 300. 
---
Added bonus is it gives 4 ore when mining instead of 1. Really useful if you're a dirty gun user and need all the bullets you can get your hands on.
---
They should make all merchant locations safe zones and you randomly spawn at one of these locations. There you could decide to walk out of safe zone or port to another location. Im a little on the fence with your base idea. In a pvp server junk will be alot harder to hold onto so i think because of this players will be more likely to defend there base rather then face constant repairs. I definitely don't think destroy stash boxes should give you any type of reward. This is the one location where player items should always be safe. 
---
Player drops on death: im also perfectly ok with losing any item thats not equipped on death other then power armor chassis but we would need a considerable larger stash box, takes up alot of space to store food water and chems in stash boxes. I uses to play Infestation on PC that game is alot like what your talking about but unfortunately it just wasn't given the love it needed by the admins.
---
As I said, my antivirus didn't like the game. Messed around with permissions and been playing fine since then.

*"Why would Bethesda do this?"*
---
I like how people within the in game pictures have cooler clothes and hair styles than us. :(
---
I hope that I am wrong. But "media" really wanted this game to fail and they made sure it will not have a easy task to get it's shit together. People who have not played the game have a very similiar, strong and negative opinion about the game, and they will not be so easily convinsed that the game is actually good.
---
r/titlegore
---
I honestly dont see the point in even playing if at any given time no matter what someone can just 1 shot me mid quest. Even in passive mode.
---
Thats not really correct at all. 90% singleplayer fans? The game just flat out barely functions, it has nothing to do with singleplayer fans. Do you even understand what the criticisms of this game are?
---
Haha love the metaphor and totally agree I have a TSE dragon that does something like 2.5k damage and theirs the Fatman dowing a whopping 450ish if I remember rightly 
---
Just wait for the new PVP mode - Survival. Sounds perfect for what you want.
---
Maybe they didn‚Äôt thought that people will get to 3 digits level so fast 
---
No one has ever put in a FO game and said, "this would be much funner with people killing me every 3 mins"
---
Fallout games are great because it's a one person experience. It was a nice break from PvP games 
---
I hope they fix pvp before they release that or it will be who can touch the other player first wins
---
That‚Äôs what I do with mobs at Whitrsprings. 
---
Yep, hope so too, else it‚Äôll just be TSE v TSE 
---
Logic dictates that if we can pick a lock with a bobby pin in a giant metal glove then it would be a breeze to play an instrument, also if you can fall asleep in a hazmat suit with that big helmet and tanks on your back then theoretically you could sleep in your P.A (just a thought lol)
---
Yeah its probably part of the reason plus its explosive so i dont know if that has a part in it
---
All that you said is true but have you ever launched one at just one enemy and watch them go flying 
---
It annoys me that I lose scrap because I forgot to swap my scrapper card back on. Like what is this perk system? Im the guy that forgets completely how to pick a lock unless I stand still for 20 seconds fumbling through menus and then I know again. Its actually just annoying and I think every positive mention it got was from people who played until lvl 20 and then wrote a review.
---
You can easily find it on Google. Just search " Hornwright summer villa fallout 76"
---
Why wait? That shit sounds awesome. Do it now get some practice battling other squads. Every survivor for themselves. 
---
Don‚Äôt worry about it? Seriously? Don‚Äôt go dropping spoilers unless they‚Äôre asked for!
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure that my comment is one of curiosity. I might be ‚Äúdiscussing lore‚Äù, but I‚Äôm also openly (and obviously) wondering what comes next.
---
Before your retort, I see that you‚Äôve recognised that I haven‚Äôt heard ‚Äúthat tape‚Äù yet. Still, you felt the need to spoil something else about that upcoming quest too...listen, maybe you‚Äôre just trying to help, but please stop. 
---
Murgle is a Saint, always willing to forgive your sins. His martyrdom is everlasting, he gives his life so that you may live. 
---
However. While Murgle will never hold your trespasses against you,  the starving faithful are not so quick to forgive. 
---
I think he means so much as "the mob is experiencing a terrible product that keeps crashing and has the mentality that it should not keep crashing"
---
I didn‚Äôt dupe anything. Maybe some of the people I acquired some it from did but I can‚Äôt say for sure so that‚Äôs not my problem
---
Yeah would live to see this fixed ASAP. Surprised it hasn't been done already tbh. Can't imagine it being that hard to change
---
No it won't. It will be melee vs. melee and stealt vs. stealth. TSE is nerfed by then.
---
The game that cost actually money to work perhaps ü§î
---
Meh,
---
I‚Äôm on pc. if you‚Äôre on pc and want a travel buddy, I‚Äôll help ya just pm me.
---
Shows what you know about fires, and coasters.
---
Alas, yes. Need to procure myself an Instigating gun or something. 
---
Damn lol 
---
Not sure where Bethesda gets their in-game change ideas from - if they read this or read stuff somewhere else - but they better read THIS. Because this adds a lot of diversity. Currently I got a settlement on top of Seneca Rocks which is raider based. I mostly run around in a sack hood over my head so I look more like a raider because I can't bring it over myself to change my character looks besides some changes like dirt on the face or another beard or hairstyle (easily reversed changes).
---
With an option like this it wouldn't be an issue anymore. 
---
Bethesda can‚Äôt tell what is duped and what is not
---
You guys are incompetent. 
---
When I pick up misiles and a misile launcher I fire the misiles at distant mountains for the small bit of fun that is. Same with mini nukes but I get the daisycutter out of storage and blow up some cars.
---
TSE has been stronger than mini nukes!
---
"Say, turn this record over, you ain't heard nothin' yet!"
---
I'M TRYING
---
I‚Äôll keep that in mind, thank you!
---
Medic build like in a group? Or solo?
---
I didnt need youtubers, I just played the game. It actually barely works. Literally last week the scorchbeast queen became unkillable when it was nearly dead and the quest failed. A youtuber didnt tell me that, I saw it. Wasted hours of farming ammo and meds. No youtuber did that.
---
Makw sure you stack your bobbles so you can kill people who are PvE. Because you know, dick moves and all.
---
Give it a rest.  You don‚Äôt like it?  Move on.  
---
In a group
---
Up up. Needs to be a feature for sure. I themed my character based on raiders but I can't change his face to match it. I want him to have a messed-up face and all that stuff but I can't do it since I love how my character looks right now (not raider-based).
---
The whole thing is a hoax.
---
Person A could have duped and you just bought items from them, and now it looks like you duped.
---
Cannot be tracked and the only people who have been banned have been reported with screenshots of multiple stacked weapons.
---
You are fine, just don‚Äôt go around boasting about it wether you got them legit or not.
---
Pvp is literally not a threat???
---
How many other people will you be playing with on average and what‚Äôs your kind of weapon and I can make one for you
---
ok i did not know this was possible, how does a PC user change their account name?
---
I went to go help a level 10 on a work shop defense, I show up and he‚Äôs 101. 
---
Yes, the big guns still suck,tbh. I carry my instigating fatman and my anti-armor minigun around for fun, but I have vastly superior weapons
---
So would I, also did the Robots killed total include player kills only or the thousands of robots that spawned out of control at Whitesprings to lag the servets then terminated themselves or the entire population at Wotoga that drops dead half the time when a approach them?
---
Right dude. I would have literally zero issue spending money and helping them with development costs if they released anything at all worth buying...The only thing i have bought so far is the camouflage rifle paint and the black overalls. That wasn't even real money it was free atoms from challenges. 
---
I WANT TO SPEND MONEY ON THIS GAME AND HELP TO MAKE IT BETTER BETHESDA!! RELEASE SOME DOPE FITS FOR MALE CHARACTERS AS WELL. I DON'T EVEN SEE FEMALE CHARACTERS WEARING ANY OF THOSE DRESSES YOU KEEP RELEASING!!!
---
Being wanted just puts you at a huge disadvantage, and to get a really big bounty you would have to just blow up camps and do you really want to be that guy haha. 
---
I have been building really funny traps at workbenches, they rarely kill people but they do make for some hilarious interactions and I think overall it adds to other people‚Äôs experience as long as you are not just trying to murder and rob their stuff. My first ones looked like brothels and said things like ‚Äúbig sexy‚Äù ‚Äúsexy time‚Äù on them, if you went in thru the powered door you would be stuck and when you pull the switch/pressure plate for the ‚Äúdoor‚Äù it would set off hidden flamethrowers that revealed a sign that said ‚Äúdie sinner‚Äù or something else ridiculous haha 
---
I'm in
---
I tried using a flare once after I stumbled upon a meeting of the yao guai, and I had remembered from looming at the map that there were people nearby. But no one came....except maybe the yao guai. My poor corpse.
---
I still Cary a flare gun and a few flares though and pass out new ones I find to lower levels. It is definitely a good RP idea, and I have heard of people responding to them.
---
Soo unfair right 
---
About 2 other people and I'm currently playing with a handmade rifle but I kind of want to do melee, Wich is 'better'.
---
March is a long ways away. I like that they are adding it but I feel like this is an option now.
---
If I move on to some new games I feel like I will lose interest.
---
Because you don‚Äôt get x01 till AFTER completing enclave.
---
I don‚Äôt wait till then to wear PA
---
Gods, you fools are stubbornly stupid until forced to face your ignorance.  Here's a pic of Ultracite at 200%.  Look at it and admit you were wrong. 
---
https://imgur.com/MwmLYHX
---
You're right. I'm about to log on and be a dick. This is supposed to be a survival game and it's not like its permadeath for whoever happens to die because of me. I hope to die alot too!
---
For a medic build probably a rifle but you can have a backup melee 
---
Only good part of that movie.
---
It's actually a pretty big deal for us azerty plebs. Building, VATS, and picture mode were incredibly awkward to use. Having to switch to qwerty was easy, sure, but having the windows shortcut enabled means you could accidently switch it back and forth. Especially bad when it happens when playing a shooter.
---
Yes indeed, and of course, that‚Äôs on purpose.
---
Its clumsy, and seems to contradict the very process they are encouraging.  And it is so artificial as to be immersion-breaking.  Maybe they will work out a more logical system at some point, but i am not holding my breath.
---
I honestly don't know what Bethesda was thinking. The whole point of having perk card, mutations,  and legendary weapons/armor is so that players can make different builds in an attempt to become as powerful as possible.......but Bethesda also wants balance for PvP?
---
You can't have balance when you have players who are running bloodied Super Sledge with a full set of Unyielding Sentinel armor with high rad low health stacked with the radicool perk card, adrenal reaction mutation, healing factor mutation, bobblehead perks, magazine perks, perks from food and drinks, and a few chems.
---
PvP in this type of game is stupid.....even more so when you try to mix it with RPG players.
---
Alright thanks for the wepon tip
---
I thought they where adding something like this into the game in the future.
---
Charisma has the most important group medic perks and of course int has one too. 10 or 9 in both is enough.
---
Charisma also has great support perks, that fit into the medic build. Cha based characters can make the group unbelievably strong.
---
There is also a legendary mod that heals the group when using vats critical, but I think it's not worth it.
---
I get about 3/3 disconnects *a week*. I don't know why other people have so many. On PC here.
---
Thanks I have been putting points in cha I will keep doing so!
---
Equally
---
If I remember right they are, I thought it was the last update but I‚Äôm probably wrong on that.
---
Not really, as I don't open threads to tell people what sensitive and woke person I am.
---
Yep, hopefully most of these are fixed in next patch coming ‚Äúsoon‚Äù.  üò¢. 
---
High fire rate gun like TSE 50cal to drain your AP and then you will die in a few shots. Dodgy is what keeps you alive.
---
Berserker is broken for me.  I have zero (0) damage resistance and the weapon has x amount of damage shown.  I put on a ton of armor, same amount of damage shows.  Does the damage on weapon not reflect berserker accurately? 
---
If Beth ever releases something like "raids/dungeons"(vaults), everyone will want a cha based character to their group.
---
Its 7% and resets after 10 seconds if you're still hitting a target you get 10 more seconds does not stack time or damage.
---
Damn I absolutely missed that picture and some of the backstory it seems. Where is it found? 
---
Nope. Fireproof and dense torso ignores explsoive and you‚Äôll be dead by the time you take my ap bar 
---
I don't have any missiles, but I can give you some mini nukes.
---
Will you send me a picture or....
---
You have to remove the floor piece connected to the top of the stairs but that usually requires removing a lot of other things too
---
Do a vendor run every day (all 7 factions) = 1400 caps
---
Play the game = caps from enemies + stuff to sell
---
Yeah I think it's modern couches.
---
Been getting CTDs pretty constantly (every couple hours or so) since the third patch.  Set the game aside because of it. 
---
Sad to hear the crashes seems to be getting worse. You're definitely not alone, judging by plenty of comments on this sub. 
---
Whaaaaat I can run mods on fallout 76? How long has this been a thing? 
---
If you download the Text Chat mod from Nexus it will give you in game chat and access to a very friendly community.
---
I'd suspect you run out of memory. I have a 16 GB rig where Fo76 does hang/quit/CTDs about every 6 hours. I have another rig with 32 GB where I have not experienced CTDs, only 1-2 random hangs (specifically only when trying to consume food sometimes). I have an 8 GB laptop and run the game in very low 640x400 and no hangs/CTDs.
---
And here I am using my t60 because it‚Äôs cheaper to repair. That being said I hardly use my PA outside of nuke zones, don‚Äôt have any mods or anything. 
---
Not if I am also have fireproof and dense and blocker and dodgy
---
Gotta say, I disagree. If I got a workshop and they force me to PvP when the workshop next to me, I just wouldn't claim workshops anymore. If you PvP with somebody who owns a workshop, you get that workshop... What's not to understand? Workshops are great to own for resources, exp, and random building plans. Please do not force me into PvP with another player by making me battle other workshops
---
Since completely dumping PvP from the game is apparently not an option......
---
I am fine with Bethesda devoting resources to give toxic PvP players their own place to play.
---
If you are like me and haven't traded on line for duped armor and guns you should have plenty of things to keep you occupied until more content comes.
---
Technically speaking VRAM of consoles couldn‚Äôt handle it
---
Isn't her voice actor the same as the trader in megaton, or at least she sounds like it to me lol
---
QA costs time and money, more important things will have been prioritised over this, I know the feeling as a Product Owner üò£
---
Assault rifle is abomination and should be purged from the game
---
You will want a vats heavy handmade with healing on vat crit his, the eagle eye mutation and any others you want probably marsupial, a good Flamer weapon (used as a secondary it literally burns through ammo), dilute your stims and learn how to craft them carry a couple bottles of alcohol on you to revive your team and lots of food to keep your team up, you will want to bat curt spam we‚Äôre almost every one of your hits will be a crit. Also since you have 15 charisma share perks that your team need I think fist aid would be best to save your teammates some points it is your job to keep them alive even if you don‚Äôt need a stim but your team does you have to stim. I would suggest life saving armor or auto stim to make sure you don‚Äôt go down. I also suggest you have your team mates give you some of there stims. https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=393f86c&amp;d=cf2ct1cc2c22c90ev2i12a72sb2eh2p02pd0pl0pk0lr2l12lk2ic4l71pp2a40s71lv0&amp;w=ik0&amp;n=Medic
---
You can switch things how oh would like and a flamer is hard to use so you might want to get ride of Friendly fire but I would try it. GOOD LUCK!üëç 
---
1.  ‚ÄúMedia‚Äù (per your definition) did not want the game to fail. All they want is views. I followed every update closely from the E3 announcement right up until B.E.T.A, and I feel comfortable saying that the overall mood was excitement. Sure, the clickbait machine took advantage of players‚Äô frustrations, but that was after release and can in no way be considered to be wanting the product to fail. 
---
2. People who have not played the game don‚Äôt have an opinion on the game. How could they? At best, they‚Äôve absorbed a gamut of other peoples‚Äô opinions, and made a calculated decision on whether or not this game is for them (still not an opinion on the actual game). At worst, they‚Äôve put too much trust in a ‚Äúyoutuber‚Äù or two, in which case, god help them. 
---
Right, it was just a heads up for people actually interested in the conversation. 
---
I haven't told you where you will find that tape, how to get it or what it contains. Happy hunting.
---
I'm sorry but you have to be less sensitive. Expect spoilers in a discussion about a game's main questline that obviously contains spoilers!
---
And that's another way to do it! I mean, we couldn't have ALL escaped the vault with our sanity intact, now could we? :D
---
So the best PAs in the game are X01 and T51? Is that T51 or T51b? 
---
I posted it link to nukes and dragon
---
Underarmor upgrades and prime reciever ammo.
---
How many you got üòâ
---
Indeed it is
---
Any junk you know you don't use a lot of, you don't need more than 100 or so.
---
If you use purified water for your water source, you only ever need 20 at most.
---
Same with stims and radaway, I usually only have about 20 of those.
---
Make sure you bulk lead and aluminum, bulking any other junk doesn't save you any space.
---
All of the above and there is nothing in the game that requires better damage resistance than Excavator gives you. I'm level 266 on my main, farm all day and only need to repair the armour about once a week.
---
Other than looks I've never found a reason to lose the 300 carry weight bonus that Excavator can give you.
---
Some of these bugs were fixed but then they came back or new ones popped up. It's a bit annoying :/
---
This, I‚Äôm not claiming workshops so I can PvP, I‚Äôm claiming workshops cos I need resources. 
---
don't, they're nasty buggers
---
fair enough
---
&gt; People who have not played the game don‚Äôt have an opinion on the game.
---
This is how it should be, but in real life it ain't, everybody has a opinion.
---
Make no mistake, it is a fun game if you're willing to approach it with an open mind and play the game for what it is.  However, the real problems come when you finish all of the content - there's simply just nothing to do because end-game doesn't exist ... and then there's the whole busted economy where a large percentage of level 50 legendary weapons were purchased on eBay from dupers.
---
Also the same with stimpacks on the quick select 
---
Right - my vault 76 suit is fully upgraded (prior to me ever getting flux) 
---
The ammo, never once used 
---
Is it used to repair anything?
---
I honestly dont even see a difference in rad intake while at a nuke zone between Excavator and X-01. They both sit around 2 rads.
---
Thanks man! I love your character planner and use it religiously. Made leveling my second character so much better!  This looks like it will be a helpful tool as well, love the grocery list for the items your planning to cook. Keep up the great work.
---
Exactly what I‚Äôm worried about. Bethesda listening to the couple of crybabies cause they scream the loudest.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Flux
---
Why did you buy an RPG.
---
You never played another Fallout title?..... Elder Scrolls?
---
This is where Bethesda goofed up from the get go. They tried to re-skin Fallout 4 into Fortnite.
---
Maybe you should learn to read you dickhead. He‚Äôs concerned Bethesda will CHANGE their plans because they are listening to the crybabies in here.
---
I don‚Äôt know what Stardew Valley is but it sounds awesome. Going to quit FO76 and play that now. Thanks for the tip. Just the tip.
---
I just did a support ticket for it explaining why, they asked for my top three picks, now Im a lost cat from FO4
---
This game is a loser, everything about is the same.  Did you actually expect this part of the game to not be broken.
---
It is, but there‚Äôs a catch. A smart wanted player will hide in someone else‚Äôs camp. Damage it and now you‚Äôve got a bounty. 
---
Feel free to try ;) I‚Äôm not telling you everything 
---
Hero, good job.
---
Is that assaultron head fixed yet? Seems as close to a laser musket or prototype gauss in the game as we can get.
---
I've been playing since launch. 
---
I still have plenty of game left to play, across multiple characters. 
---
But I play enjoying the experience I take my time, I'm not a grinder. 
---
That was the one excuse that could make me turn you loose. Bounty's cleared, you're free to go.
---
‚Äúa discussion about a game‚Äôs main questline that obviously contains spoilers‚Äù? Where was the spoiler before you came along?
---
My very simple request is that you think twice before posting anything that might give away information that people were openly wondering about...unless of course someone asked for the answer.
---
VIRTUE SIGNALING!!!!!!
---
I like how vague he was and you automatically used the word "dupe." 2 words after the start of your sentence.
---
Was the game intended to be boring, lifeless, and hollow?
---
The nurfs to the 2 shot ballistic guns is huge. Add that with the perk card that reduces 45% ballistic damage on yourself i think we can overcome most 1 shot deaths. I think in some cases if you really really tweek your build you can still achieve a 1 shot kill but you will have to sacrifice alot in your build in other locations. I have taken every possible card that ups my damage. Im a glass cannon but very squishy and my carry weight could be better. 
---
 
---
I think droping chems or even other items not equipped (other then power armor chassis) is a great idea. It will make you really feel like your in a survival type game. Real Risk and Reward. Each time you start your journey you will have to decide what your willing to pull out of that stash box and risk losing.
---
This is unfortunately true. I‚Äôd like to drop Tru Hiker and just live off the food and drink I find. I‚Äôm sure I could find more than enough to keep me going, even with Speed Demon. And yet, I cannot stop myself hoovering up every single food item, Nuka Cola or water carton I come across. 
---
The entire game is not for impatient people. 
---
I play 76 like I read a book. I enjoy it, I take it in fully. I don't rush through it. 
---
This is great info and looks great too. Thanks!
---
I pm'ed a poor lvl 12 dude if he wanted to inherit my trusty legendary lvl 15 shotgun, that i didnt want to throw it away and that it will carry him easy to lvl 25, even further...turns out he was actually lvl 125! and i fucking embarrassed myself.. Tho he was nice about it end ended up gifting me some plans! Your awesome,dude!
---
The game is fun have your own experience. Put in more hours then give it another review.
---
If 16GB of DDR4 RAM can‚Äôt cope with this game and the Bethesda launcher... 
---
Don‚Äôt say ‚Äúwe‚Äù as you‚Äôre not speaking for me. I don‚Äôt agree with you in some points and I‚Äôm sure other players don‚Äôt agree as well. 
---
Reading comprehension: the Atoms I gained playing the game.  No need to buy Atoms if you actually play the game. 
---
Bad idea: 
---
1- Camps are currently unmarked - so no on can find your vending machine. Changing this will mean griefer paradise.
---
2- Travelling costs money and I don't want to have to spend a bunch of caps to check if you have anything better than overpriced junk legendaries for sale. 
---
I remember Ultima Online before the sunder of each shard. Where you had to be on constant vigilance because you would lose *everything* if you died. Some of the most heart palpatating moments I have ever had in gaming was from UO.
---
If your doing a medic biuld the perk intelligence perk chemistry or chemist perk double the amount of med you can make and its OP but you do need to be a high level to get it
---
Meanwhile people go apeshit over the dumbest fixest that shouldnt have been a problem at launch to begin with.
---
I know I can't wait

The repair/craft bug (where it shows you have all the mats but you still can't do it) is caused when some of the mats are in your inventory and some are in your stash. The game can't figure that out  Putting them all in one or the other fixes it (but it's damn annoying).
---
Personally, I'm getting really tired of my PA torso and arms being unequipped every time I put on my PA or fast travel. My armor value is still the same as if they were equipped, but their weight is added to my inventory so I'm overencumbered every time and constantly have to stop and reequip them.
---
They probably never expected people to sit at the golf course for a week straight grinding levels.
---
No they don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs not their opinion, it‚Äôs someone else‚Äôs opinion coming out of their mouths!
---
If you were really born in 1982, then you would have seen way too much of this in your life to NOT know the difference. 
---
T-51
---
It would be pretty neat if we can pick what type of material we use to craft a weapon for different stats and durability, like Elder Scrolls Online. If I can use ultracite and black titanium to craft power armor why cant I craft my weapons with it
---
What do you play on?
---
MMG mod does Bleed, DCG does extra damage (for comparison as well Power Fist does armor penetration). Whilst in my example DCG does do 3 more damage, it is insignificantly higher and not worth writing off MMG when the numerical difference is 1-2%. 
---
The weight of difference of 5lbs extra on the MMG is lessened by the fact the DCG Extra Claws mod adds another 3 lbs to it's 10 lbs making it 13 lbs. 
---
So Martial Artist's extra effect of -60% melee weapon weight makes MMG's 15 lbs drop to 6 lbs, and DCG's 13 lbs drop to 5.2 lbs. Less than 1lb difference and also not worth ignoring MMG over. 
---
Plus MMG drops like candy from all the mole miners so the mod is easy to learn, the crafting materials easy to get off them. Definitely  a first tier unarmed weapon.
---
"If they're right, your numbers can't possibly be correct" - it sounds like whatever I go through the effort of posting, that's the get out card, you will disregard whatever I have because my figure must be wrong as your buddy must be completely right. I've been playing unarmed build since beta until now, purely unarmed. I'd say the line up is Powerfist then DCG then MMG but the numbers are extremely close as my above example shows, and MMG is a good substitute for DCG any day.

Killed her 9 times today. The entire lobby was in on the 5th. So no.
---
What else would he be hinting at lol

XBOX

One tine i went tick hunting came home and did some crafting 70 stim-pack per players in my team later we were unkilllable

---
The screenshots I took on 1/18 are the most recent build. I have my base directly south of Site Alpha. I get lots of traffic and have done some trades/free loot. I really like RPing as a Red Rocket franchise owner.
---
I've done a lot of trading on the subs, not only is my username here but my GT have Jen in it. My character is a girl. I think it's pretty obvious I'm a girl.  I've gone into party chat when requested for trading. I've randomly sent team invites while in nuke zones and met and played with a few players so far in the wild. No bad people yet (besides a few griefers I encountered), and no random "u girl?" messages like I'd get in COD.
---
Why though?
---
Those are the kind of days I enjoy most.
---
Oh ok also switch out rifleman for commando if your using an auto rifle
---
Coulda got it from bounties or pvp, stole brown bags insert "you played yourself." Meme here
---
If caveat emptor is the games defense, then I feel bad for bgs
---
Alright
---
I tried this twice back in December, once with an artillery barrage and once with small arms fire and I got a bounty on my head both times. Idk if the devs changed in a recent patch but back then it didn‚Äôt matter that the enemy player was wanted. 
---
I have 3 characters at 75 on xbox, 2 at 50 on playstation and an extra on both in the 20s. I feel like I could be in the 200s if I just had one character and that's without any grinding.
---
What are you playing on? I‚Äôm on ps4 so maybe it has to do with system difference? Idk it‚Äôs just annoying to me because I‚Äôve been putting in hard work for 20 minutes just to see no reward and I‚Äôm level 97 while I aced it before as a level 68-73
---
T-60 repair is cheaper.
---
I haven‚Äôt really, not bothered what you think as I know myself I have never duped an item. So jokes on you
---
t51 is the best for ballistic DR, t60 is not paticularly good at anything except repair cost.
---
Patrick Swayze in every single sense please.
---
No.. No they don't. Also don't talk to be like a Jack add its completely uncalled for. Blissfully ignorant... Sigh...
---
I use my Ultracite in SBQ fights, it never gets a dent and just feels good :)
---
Yes, hello police? This guy right here.
---
Man, I was just offering an idea. If you don't like it, don't do it.
---
Thanks! Reading this and the other comments I've been in the Savage Divide the whole time which appears to explain the lack of level consistency (i.e. a location with both lvl 10 and lvl 60 mobs). 
---
I think the developera brains need a fucking buff.
---
Ahh this helps. Thank you. 
---
Charleston Capitol / DMV building. Along with a holotape that expands the lore. 
---
I doubt it is a glitch, I saw dozens of players above 100 lvl and each one of them had a compressed number. The devs simply ignored this issue. 
---
T-51b because the Nuka Cola paint &gt; than all the atom shop paint.
---
Honestly, the DR offered by any of the PA is sufficient. I mostly run Excavator for the 300 bonus carry weight and stuff still tickles me.
---
Ps4.
---
Sure they can, the skins would just use gold to craft.
---
Bothered enough to reply. So jokes on you.
---
And without misinformation spread by people like this OP which cause a panic and flood Bethesda with stupid questions. There wouldn‚Äôt have even been an issue. Now lots of reddit readers are going to take this as face because again like the OP are too lazy to go read the FACTUAL information. 
---
"Connection failed: Timed out while waiting for server to respond."  
---
All day so far. Anybody else?  
---
Is this the new content Bethesda talked about? Endless grinding to find a server that works?
---
I was thinking kind of a merge of both ideas.
---
Every player can craft a machine in their camp. But doing so also populates an existing vending machine in one of the empty stores in Whitespring.
---
Example: I place my vending machine in my camp and stock it with stuff, if someone finds my camp they can access it. However, if they go to the vendor mall in WS, they can access it there. Along with the machines of the other 23 players on the servers machines.
---
Maybe it‚Äôs just who I‚Äôve been grouped then 
---
But the enemy scaling was really weird last night 
---
I can‚Äôt get over those fucking crickets 1 shotting me from full health in power armour 
---
This is a wonderful story! I personally love the multiplayer in 76. (When it works) I have met alot of really good friends just wandering around in the wastelands. To hear that you are making friends as well is heartwarming. 
---
If you guys are PC my ign is Tionis-alpha. I'd love to wander the wastes with you! 
---
There's a perk that slows the degredation down.
---
Moira? I haven‚Äôt looked into it, but they are similarly annoying in their perkiness.
---
I feel like the subreddit would‚Äôve tipped us off by now though...
---
Im all honesty. Ive watched people aim at the sky and run around and never take more then 1 shot. 
---
Barrel tile is what had curved roof tiles are called.  I live them.  It gained traction in Miami in the 1920 imported from Spain /Italy and its popularity just has continued to grow over a 100 years here. 
---
Agree entirely. When someone says FO4 is their favourite in the series, or praises it heavily, I am immediately skeptical. 
---
Fallout 4 definitely carries Bethesda's Fallout feeling, the Americana, the humour, the aesthetic is there. (Which I do enjoy)
---
It is however the least immersive, least interesting story they've told. It's set in New England and yet feels nothing like New England. It doesn't give the same feeling that 76 does for WV. 
---
The story? Finding your missing son? Cliche. Mysterious, questionable intenioned secret organization? Cliche. Sassy reporter? Cliche. Oh she's got a smarmy street wise little sister? Double cliche. 
---
I also love when these same people make claims about the game's meaningful choices. As if they are abundant, and really mold the world as you progress through it. When in reality it's just a pick your ending situation. (As much as I've enjoyed BGS fallout games, their meaningful choices? Are rarely meaningful, rarely have an extended impact, and largely just open and close certain quest lines)
---
I like the Idea,   and let us decide the price of things ..have a suggested price for item but final sale price should be owner discretion. 
---
if people want visitors, they will make camp in visible and well traveled areas... the ones who dont want visitors can still hide in the woods.
---
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è cant win em all i guess lol
---
Leave the server
---
Probably hitting it to get the loot drop but not wanting the effort to kill 
---
Half the group yesterday went afk which made it worse cause then we had 8 people but only 3-4 were even doing anything 
---
And 2 of them were under 30
---
This is going to be a youtube video. Lmao
---
I'll go take a look, thanks for the info!
---
It‚Äôs like a less harsh rust kinda, but there‚Äôs story , and nukes , and lots of stuff to make it different. 
---
Boolin 
---
The issue really isnt the build, I can kill legendaries regardless of what perks I have going ... My problem is not have a server stable enough for me to finish killing legendaries. In a 3 hour session my game will crash 4 maybe 5 times 
---
A server hopp should fix it.
---
Used for decontam arches also....
---
I tend to build my camps in places where they're easily found, so this would be great. Player-owned vending machines would also save a lot of time and hassle when trading, which can be super slow due to a lot of people having trouble with the interface (especially the 'offers only' button), people accidentally exiting the trade menu, and prices being so slow/difficult to set.
---
I suggest instead playing spider man or red dead 2. Rather then ruin other people's game experience. Even you could take up what a few others have been doing and dumping extra recipies and plans ECT.. In train stations for new players. 
---
Number of Reddit users trying to be clever in how they bitch and moan about the game......
---
Yummy, catmeat
---
yup, probably something to do with the extra TNT domes, but someone posted a iic og what looks like the flatwood monster, but without the helmet the other day...
---
Decontamination shower. 
---
Lvl 235. No fucking exp glitch like alot of you cunts either.
---
This game sucks ass on so many levels, youre better off slamming your dick in a toilet sit at a truck stop.
---
Dont waste your time.
---
Awesome, thanks for this!!
---
Only mid-level players take your junk. High level ones don't have enough stash space to make it worthwhile. 
---
I've tried playing this last week a few times, but crashed about 5 minutes after loading and I've noticed the load time has seemed to increased as well.
---
Exactly can‚Äôt have hero‚Äôs without villains now can we?
---
Go all in. Roleplay it.
---
Pick your victims for specific things. Or only murder in a certain location. 
---
Go full serial killer 
---
You just got shot...in the face...with a missile launcher. This should not give you the option of "just walk it off" Your armor should be in tatters. Your bones should all be broken. Because you just got shot...in the face...with a missile launcher.
---
Maybe it's like with Ford cars in the 90's - the odometer only went up to 99,999 miles which seemed to indicate the expected lifespan of the vehicle in the manufacturer's eyes. Maybe Bethesda didn't expect anyone to make it past level 99...
---
(For the record, I'm not hating on the game and I'm level 125 currently)
---
Cat meat is a thing. 
---
Please do not lookup "roof rabbit ranch" in Fallout 4 ... 
---
Because it took their internal play testers months to get to level 50.
---
There's nothing in the game files about luck affecting legendary drop rates. Luck only affects the condition an item drops in. Anything else is rumors 
---
Yes. Fallout is 99% Day Z.
---
All 4 entries in BGS Fallout series. The aesthetic. The themes. The settings. The mechanics. 
---
All lifted from a game that didn't exist when BGS bought the IP.
---
Is there a cat resource gatherer?
---
Literally didnt mention/change 1 broken thing game wise in tbat entire rant.
---
You already work for beth.
---
What I do already lol..he goes by the name The Music Man üéµ ..I‚Äôll play a random song quietly on the mic and if the people respond with something negative about the song they become the next victim 
---
Cause remember The Music man can make all your dreams come true..
---
I‚Äôve been hoarding all the quantum I can get ( 45?). But finally started selling regular Nuka Cola and using Cherry.  I‚Äôm down to 70 or so cherry ones.

This will be a youtube video.

Springs.....   twitch ...., twitch......
---
Shut up, Conky.
---
I got spanked with this bug last night when I relocated my camp. On top of that, it duplicated everything in my in my budget every time I had to move 3 inches for 40 caps.
---
Mucho annoying! Also, that bulldozer.... its not working very well. I'm still getting mounds of dirt and rocks sticking up from my floor.
---
This works most of the time, but I have on one occasion found myself in a situation where a stair could not be removed, even though I demolished an entire floor around it. There are quite a few bugs with this building system. My other favourite is power connector through the wall; if you don't install them before building the next story, they will automagically jump up one floor when you try to place them.
---
Although the default snapping in Fallout 4 left a lot to be desired, the fewer restrictions worked much better in that game.
---
Level 220 and have NEVER seen the actual barn set for sale, yet it is apparently quite common. My guess is that after a certain level vendors stop selling it
---
Mueble is the cutest !
---
The game is plagued by technical issues though overall it's a good game. Especially if you liked Fallout 3 or 4. 
---
\*My Friend and I were playing last night and at one point he becomes invisible to me. Can see him on the map but not in the game world. Had to exit the game to resolve this. Have spots where enemies load in but don't respond or have no heads. I get out of power armor and fall through the world. Tons of things like this which is hard to excuse in a AAA game. 
---
There's 2 ranks to both science cards, there's 2 cards.
---
I came across a legendary squirrel once. Dropped a bloodied rolling pin.
---
Number of bugs fixed from BETA before launch?
---
Number of cash Todd got for releasing a game worse then many early access games in terms of bugs
---
Number of fanboi's and white knights that encourage more of the same from Bethesda and others
---
Number of fucks ...erm thanks given to above fanbois by Todd and Bethesda
---
That was my worry, that there is some sort of level gate with this plan.   Time for an alt to head over to Harper's Ferry I guess.  
---
The developers copy/pasted the flare gun in from FO4 but forgot the combat rifle 308 mod. =\
---
But for real give it a function. Any function. 
---
Its been underwhelming since day 1 for me.  Thanks to the people selling legendaries to the Watoga vendor, you are the real heroes!! Without you I would be running in all crafted gear.
---
Exactly. There is a level cap on some plans, including the Barn Set. I started looking for them when I was level120+ and ended up having to buy them from somebody else.
---
What?

---
Thank you, The base damage of a fatman gives it a shittier DPS than a tse 10mm pistol with a fire rate of 74 given the damage of the pistol is a whopping  126 damage per shot. The other issue here is the fact that .50 cal balls are so easy to make if you have a lead extractor, the only good thing about the fatman right now is literally the animation of shooting it and the slight adrenaline rush of not killing yourself and dropping all the junk that took you so long to find to make your damn ammo. 
---
Have you learnt any plans for Energy weapons?
---
It is a much better game played with others, preferably friends. A bunch of friends in the same room playing this game is a blast. That really offset a lot of the games early issues for us.
---
Playing it solo is less fun for me, it becomes very grindy and an inventory management nightmare.
---
Enemies are too easy...... I'm going to start sucker punching innocent players with my OP melee build. Yeah that sounds like it will be more challenging.
---
Go play Red Dead Redemption you will find thousands of toxic people like yourself to play with.
---
This is great
---
This is software testing 101. Always test all of your possible number places. Eights, nines, and ones have to be checked in the places just for formatting. Test the top limit of the field every time and what your error solution is for people who reach the top limit. Unfortunately this is probably marked as a UI error which is low priority because it doesn't break functionality.
---
I had the same problem. You can always try the wokshop events, they drop camp plans. I was lazy tho, so i just bought them from someone lmao. The plan level cap is very frustrating...
---
How about adding the recruitment beacon, which would map your house for the whole server?  
---
I know cat meat is a thing!! I was being sarcastic about crafting a fucking Cat. Jesus Christ, you people are thick...
---
/s /s /s /s
---
 You get it now?!?!!!
---
You say AA and furious is better but never go into detail why.
---
Either way is fine with me. My opinion on workshops is that it is a pvp location in the normal mode map. It should be taken with caution. Seems to me that workshops was intended to promote pvp in what is mostly a pve game. All should you know that if you take a workshop there is a good chance a real player will take it away from you. The smart choice would be to take workshops as a group and defend them as a group. My favorite thing to do in Fallout76 is take workshops from others. Some times i do it solo somtimes with friends. I have some pretty good pvp encounters this way. It end up being alot of fun. Ive even grouped up with the players ive taken the workshops from after and made new friends. Most players that jump servers taking workshops they just looking for pvp looking for some fun. Most players ive encountered in pvp are actually pretty cool peeps not out looking to grief you they dont care about your loot. The junk is all over the map so easy to find. Pvp for me  is simply about testing your skills vs other real players. Im so very excited that we will get the chance to do this in a survival mode that i think will bring us real challenge risk and reward. Yes if i kill you i will pick up your loot but if your cool about it id give it back. i might just give you handfuls of plans. Legendary drops.
---
Also used to make certain PA mods (if you can find the plans) as well as mutation serums. 
---
Does it not show up in your craft menu or does it say "Doesn't meet the requirements"?  
---
So why is it that when I killed the flatwoods monster for the first time it completed my challenge "kill all types of creatures" which I only had 1 left - aliens.
---
Flatwoods is an alien
---
As you get more recipes, selecting by stat may be the more efficient ui
---
Because social media has become a deity. Sheep. 
---
if i want to be noticed on the server i will open a shop.... but to be heard we need siren
---
Lol your really downplaying multiplayer guess all the modders trying to get skyrim and fallout 4 multiplayer are just wasting their time then.
---
Some don't start until someone goes to the area.  I know Fertile Soil seems to start every time I go through Flatwoods.
---
But he can't buy duped gear and finish the game by level 66 in Red Dead 2. 
---
Yes and trapping people 
---
I remember using rugs to patch holes in floors in FO4. XD
---
Glad you found it useful! :-)
---
Thank you!
---
Only had one bad experience and it was all the way back in BETA.  Guy was a creep and killed my partner and tainted me about it... It was very disturbing.  Every since, kindness and magic, glad I stuck around!
---
Nevermind.
---
Yeah that'll pass. Dont worry.
---
Acid's my block too, which is why I have an acid extractor at my base. Don't forget you can harvest the node your extractor is on to sort of "double tap" it. Snellygaster and Wendigos give junk items that give you acid too
---
Ps4 here. Every trip to whitesprings in the past week has resulted in rage quit due to blue screen. 
---
Any chance a blueprint could cause that?
---
I found a magazine where the effect was: "-20% Heavy gun ammo consumption" so maybe it's already out there!
---
I think its a bug personally every once in a while a server will only have 1 event. When most servers have 5+ all the time.
---
Wonder what the level cap is. I‚Äôve been trying myself. May have to get out the alt.
---
I was a bit upset when I noticed it too, but it's still free ammo lol
---
I dont think that was a noodle bowl.
---
I found the answer.  You have to actually equip the weapon to see damage change.
---
I think it would be better to have them "available" on the map, but be started when a player actually starts them. If the player leaves the area, the timer should stop and restart when a new player enters the area. 
---
I‚Äôm not going to criticise them for the cliches, because there is essentially no such thing as an original story anymore (creative ways to hide the cliche, sure, but no original stories).
---
As an Australian, I‚Äôve never been to Boston/New England before, so I can‚Äôt comment/criticise there either (side note: I‚Äôve been to Vegas and definitely lost my shit over the real world equivalents to FONV locations that I saw).
---
The consequences of choices, however, were disappointingly M.I.A. in FO4. 
---
It doesn‚Äôt worry me so much that, in previous games, it might only be a closed questline, because the lore revealed in those quests are why I love the franchise (Megaton, anyone?). In FONV, consequences of your choices extended to the relationships you had with multiple factions, a mechanic that really could‚Äôve been awesome in FO4 (it actually seems funny that ‚Äúall the factions in FO76 are dead anyway, so who cares?‚Äù)
---
I love FO76 for the same reasons I loved its predecessors. Lore, exploration, adventure. It‚Äôs missing a connection to survivors that I never expected it to have anyway (given the lore).
---
FO4 was beautiful to look at and delivered on those key elements, but FO5‚Äôs story better have some serious forks built in!
---
Feed the people does that a Lot too. If there's people in the area it'll just keep spawning.
---
I have like 80 something, but I can spare you 50. ^^b
---
Nah I even like the bugs. Makes it all the better. Kinda in the spirit of fallout.
---
But you CAN sell it?
---
That's when you go on Discord buy ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ items, as well as neon letters. 
---
Handmade. Common sense. Boom.
---
How much you want for them
---
Ive whacked ghouls further out of the park with a baseball bat, i want the fatman to completely dismember them beyond recognition.  I want people to see what was once a scorchbeast and assume somebody dumped a truckload of hamburger helper on the ground where it once stood.  
---
I would gladly buy your and /u/ManWhoCameFromLater nuka colas if you are on PC. 
---
Made fresh new styles for NPC's that aren't in the game and gave us wood armour :/
---
Bethesda Dev team all over :(
---
She look's like Tiny Tina from Borderlands in her late Teen's!
---
Very good idea and use!
---
Glad your enjoying it.

I logged into a new world, and this one only has Swarm of Suitors. Maybe it's bugged at the  moment. 
---
This.
---
And as people reach higher levels and have already explored the world, they are less inclined to physically walk from one location to the next, so they aren't tripping the Events as they go.

Aren't we getting a personall vending machine next patch for player stores?

You Sir are a Hero!
---
Yeah at lvl 100-200+ you really need TSE weapon to kill high mobs with one shot or faster. If your not a hoarder then you won't need perk cards that reduce weight and can focus on damage perks which can help with maybe just having an explosive high damage weapon.
---
You have the option not to play survival mode. You can play normal mode. But live a little and give this a try you might find you really like the aspect of never feeling safe. Knowing around that next corner might be your death or that fool just made a big mistake camping that room you just walked in when you blow him away. It will really make you think. Hmmm ive got a decent amount of loot should i continue for more or port home and stash it away nice and safe.
---
Your decisions in this game is what will make it either a good experience or a bad experience. 
---
They are similar but I've just looked and no it isn't unfortunately, they do sound alike tho

I‚Äôve yet to find anyone with a mic to harass

Nice try, BGS PR, but I dont believe you.
---
As a responsible gamer, if your unsure you should leave by the train station in Watoga!
---
Can't say for sure if Bethesda would accept "I didn't know" as an excuse ;)

The game seems to size itself to the available RAM. On the laptop, it takes about 4.5 GB. On the smaller desktop, it eats about 13 GB and is often at the edge of Windows swapping. I usually have to close the browser and the launcher to give it some wiggle room, otherwise it gets into a lot of loading hiccups.
---
Duping still exsists lmao 
---
It's always nice to hear about people enjoying the game. Hope you keep having a blast! And if you're on PS4 and want to team up or trade sometime, hit me up. I make good armor and guns, and I enjoy running around smashing ghouls with lower level players :)
---
I played it slow for a long time, I like exploring mostly. I think ive done all the quests by now (I recently stumbled back across ecological balance, one that I forgot to do).
---
Leveling up hasnt meant much to me since 100.
---
Oooh yes, Path To Enlightenment all the way!!
---
Looked into it in the last 48mins, then? You might‚Äôve done that before your comment and saved me from looking for no reason! üòÇ

This morning was fine played about an hour no issues.

T60 - repair cost
---
Are you stupid?!  Do you not understand numbers?  Go check each PA yourself if you are that dense.  Post your proof if you come up with different findings.  Otherwise, just shut-up with your denials, because so far you have offered no proof or evidence, just continually blathered despite the fact I showed you what each armor's stats are.
---
I've just rebuilt my camp and noticed this. I don't mind it though. I'd reasoned that the ground was slightly higher on the ends which was allowing me to step up. If your experience differs then I'm out of ideas.
---
A couple people in this thread mix up screws and springs. 
---
I‚Äôve never experienced this. Sounds rough. 
---
I smell a book deal
---
I'm not too sure how viable this is but I remember my medic using it so I'll just throw it in.
---
Get the Strength perk that reduces chem weight and turn any of your stims into diluted with the chemist perk (or don't if you can just have a bunch of normal stims). Now that you have a boatload of stims, get the Charisma(?) Perk that heals nearby teammates when you use a stim. Whenever your team is low, run in, spam stims and run back out. If the first aid perk stacks with the team heal perk, even better.
---
I wouldn't try this as an immediate build because I'm not sure if it'll even work. On the off chance it does, there's my two cents
---
Its a shame, i have two (two shot fatmans) and an anti armor fatman ready to go for when they do finally get around to it, I just have to dust them off from sitting in the bottom of my stash box.  Im starting to speculate they‚Äôre purposely making them so inefficient as to encourage players not to use them because the animations and destruction would overload bethesdas fragile servers.  
---
A month late :DDD
---
A burned book deal
---
Haha. Someone replied to my suggestion so I was relooking at this. 
---
Thats awesome. Im level 46, been playing since the beta, beat the story and never once hand nothing to do so far. Just unlocked Fusion Generators too
---
Power User - 30% /60% / Cores are Doubled
---
I'm honestly not sure what the ingame difference is between the T-51 and the T-51B, as I think I've seen the same names at each level variant.  Basically what I can tell you is that my tests and screenshots were of the Level 50 T-51 armor pieces, upgraded with the Fix-It-Good Perks.  There's lower level pieces, starting at level 30, but obviously the mileage will vary depending on the level.  Since level 50 is the definitive final level for power armor, it's just more concrete for me to give those as endgame examples.
---
I just wish it was abit harder end game, first scorched queen fight and 7 of use managed to kill her in about 3 minutes without issue
---
I don't really have a problem with workshops being PvP.
---
I do have a problem with someone fighting me for a workshop not because they need to farm resources from that workshop but just to be dicks. I feel like the current system is open to dicks, who are looking for trouble and not resources, by allowing them to hover their mouse over all of the workshops looking to see if they are claimed.
---
If you need crystal and when you get to Berkeley Springs and find me there we fight for it or maybe I roll over and let you have it. In the case where I let you have it and you don't even need to use it......well that's just stupid and ruining others gaming experience for no reason.
---
There are mods, such as various headlamps and motion-assist servos, but they're not obtained from scrapping.  Sell away.
---
Better for me, in that they are beneficial but not stupidly OP. Even after the nerf, TSEs will probably still be the most *powerful*, I don't personally think that makes them the best. I like the game to be mildly challenging. 
---
I mean, I think a lot of us were suckered into the Alpine River Cabins on the basis of that human scream that comes from out of nowhere.
---
On the other hand, that kind of thing works best when there is the possibility of it being an actual person.  76's zealous insistence that every human NPC is a human player undermines that.
---
It's a fucking video game fam
---
Except level literally doesn't matter for power over level 50
---
And were done here smh..
---
I tried to use them like elevated platforms to shoot from when enemies rush my camp. Instead they just magically walk up stairs that dont exist and attack me....
---
T51 has the highest damage and energy protection at max level. Somewhat lower rad protection than most others, though I've found it's still sufficient in nuke zones. However, it's harder to find than T60 and harder to get mods for. 
---
But still my favorite because A) Nuka Cola paint job and B) I just love the design of it.
---
you just want ALL the assault rifles
---
It's really bad when instead of just trying PVP you need to come and get approval? from group chats and then reddit.
---
Just go pick a fight with someone in game and see if you enjoy the thrill/ ride. No need for hours and hours of discussion.
---
Never know you may find that raider life was the calling you'd mised!
---
I don't get it either, all the information he has about you is that you are female. He has no idea what you look like, your personality, your political stance etc. You could be a luddite nazi living in tasmania and he'd have no way of knowing. Like even if he was shallow he'd have no way of knowing he'd find you attractive at all. Hitting on someone that is just a disembodied voice just screams desperate. And what's the plan after they charm you, you fly to meet up for thousands of dollars over a few sessions in a video game?  
---
I think these people forget females have just as big a variation in personality, looks etc as guys do, but girls are so rare that as soon as they hear a female voice they just fill in the blanks and assume you're a superhottie and their fantasy just grows out of their control.
---
Server stability
---
That‚Äôs awesome! 
---
PS - Forgive my low level, but what are hardened masses used for late game and why are they so valuable? 
---
I'd probably give this game a chance if it went on sale at ten bucks.. 
---
PC Something's wrong with my login.  I am having a weird double login.
---
The game opens, and everything is glitched visually:  Missing chunks of buildings, everything's in black and white.  Then the game goes back to the load screen and everything loads again.
---
As of this week I seem to be in the game before everything has finished loading.  No NPCs (at Whitesprings).  I can walk around but not interact with anything.  I frequently cannot draw my weapon.  If I open the pip boy the game freezes.
---
All legit issues and the boot lickers on this sub downvote your post so it has no visibility to the people that can actually fix it. The way people defend Bethesda on this sub is insane. Fuckin /r/hailcorporate up in here.
---
I like alot of your ideas. 
---
However
---
Everyone is assuming this huge balance issue with the new PvP mode. A mode we have very little info on. 
---
And the balance concern comes from one basic idea. If I'm level 8, how can I compete with a level 154?  
---
Everyone makes new characters! Even playing field! Yayyyy!
---
Great. Have fun with lumping the entire survival player base into the starting area with NO pvp restrictions AND increased rewards. Oh, and they are all low levels when slightly better weapons and Armour make a huge difference. 
---
Your playing experience will quickly degrade into running away from everyone you see.
---
You're worried about a level 135 killing you? For minimal reward and useless stufff? Where at least there'd likely be other high level players hunting them down while they're distracted killing lowbies?
---
You should be worried about the level 15 with a hunting rifle and modded armour who is butchering every low level player they can find for good (for a l vel 15) rewards and useful shit. 
---
Its going to be a low level farming chain until some players break out of the low levels..... 
---
I hate assault rifles. I just love Wise Mothman. We take a selfie every time he comes to impart his wisdom.
---
and wait till you encounter a scorchbeast
---
Did you also know that there are fireflies, beavers and squirrels? 
---
So many of these posts... cringe. 
---
True lol sorry ;) 
---
Give ya 2 caps for it!
---
Hahaha awesome vid no bullshit right to the point 
---
Because you haven‚Äôt found the plan for it yet 
---
just wait till you encounter a scorchbeast fighting a mythical deathclaw that will suddenly retarget to you
---
That's what I'm thinking also.  It's an oversight.  When developers played the game they never went into triple digit levels.  So never saw and never fixed it.  I see this sort of thing all of the time during development. 
---
Make sure all the materials needed are in your stash. If you still have them on you you need to place them in stash. 
---
Someone enjoying a game, how could they
---
I believe you need it to make orbital strike grenades.
---
I absolutely love this idea! The layout is nice to look at too. "stingwing stew" needs a correction. Great idea
---
I know what you talking about. I was going to place my camp there too, I just wasn't sure if you could actually build stairs.
---
As someone squeezing every last bit of AP regen I can for my Commando-Critspam build, this is a godsend!! Thank you!
---
That's why we create our own end games - whether we go cannibal or bounty hunter or den mother, we know what makes each and every one of us special ;D
---
I said that I cannot stash mine. I said that‚Äôs cool that OP could stash his.
---
And seriously? Spreading misinformation?
---
This topic was about a mask that you can no longer get, as they have fixed it. They have also fixed duping, so can you please stop? It is a dead thread. 
---
OP was the one who said he could stash and dupe the mask. I never said that you could, only that it was cool that OP was able to. So again, please read the entire thread and stop.  
---
When a sub of a controversial game has to have posts always justifying or defending the game, you know something is up. 
---
camden is pretty good, but can be dangerous if you're not careful.  Generally do all the forest and toxic valley quests when they pop up.  The XP you get from them is going to shoot you through levels pretty quick.
---
Need to knock out my last 6 levels and join the rest of the 29 teams for my plat. Once that‚Äôs done, I‚Äôm taking a long break til we get some substantial content &amp; fixes/changes
---
This is my original comment since you cannot seem to read:
---
People are selling these all over the place. It‚Äôs widely known. 
---
You get candy when someone is doing the event on your server, so that‚Äôs kind of cool. 
---
You can drop it on the ground, but it can‚Äôt be stored or traded. 
---
If you do the Monster Mash event, you‚Äôll have 2 masks in your inventory but afterwards you‚Äôll only keep one. 
---
Well if you know where I mean, the challeneg is placeing the camp itself. Once you do, fast travel to said camp and if you are lucky you spawn in a place that is inside the "penthouse" and in there it will let you build a floor piece, and there is room for 3 stories of height before you reach the roof.
---
Short, but someone absolutely comprehensive. Good job!
---
And after my original comment, this is what OP said:
---
Ive never seen one for sale in the discord at all, so that is new to me. Sounds like it will be eventually fixed though if you get rewards outside of the event. Also I was able to stash mine. I did so while on white springs out of fear of selling/salvaging it. Which I found out can't be done
---
And that‚Äôs just how his privileged got this way. Sold!
---
When first start the game and making your way to the overseers camp, there is a farm just to the south of the vault. On the 2nd floor there's a dead cat that gives cat meat. 
---
OP might want to hang on to a few of the pages, that noodle bowl might come back with a vengance
---
So again, please stop replying to my comment in this dead thread. 
---
If you‚Äôre that bored and worried about misinformation about something that can no longer be done, again, you can comment on the original posters comments. 
---
Solid point
---
That should be enough to found the ottoman empire run by cats.
---
Yeah, which makes it even crazier that people are so adamant about defending so much with it.  I own it too, and it is an affront to common sense to claim the game is not badly off
---
But it's the same thing. They count it as their opinion, even if we don't. It makes no difference.
---
The lack of endgame is a serious concern. My fireteam and I are starting to look into new options now. 
---
After launching and killing SBQ 3 times in a row last night, having ran dozens of whitespring nukes and plain have no more room/reason for junk collecting...we all are in agreement, new content before anthem comes out, or we are taking a long hiatus from the game.
---
I enjoyed the first 20h, but then the problems of this game were cleary visibile. 
---
Please give us a honest feedback when you played 40-60h
---
Please also keep in mind, that FO76 is a online multiplayer game, where people usually play (expect to play) more than 100 or even thousands of hours.
---
You can still do it, and it's necessary, in fo76.
---
There are many existing building can be camp location I was doing that before as well. But there‚Äôs the downside that‚Äôs they usually not near lakes so no industrial water purifier 
---
That‚Äôs because fallout 76 is supposed to be fallout 5, and 5 comes after 4 so yeah we‚Äôre gonna fucking base it off fallout 4 they sucked at 76 and they just have to keep fixing shit til it‚Äôs good just like every online game. Rant over. 
---
Wow you plainly say this, its still there in your follow up
---
"Since been duped so bad, so now you‚Äôre lucky to get 500 caps. "
---
It cannot be duped nor could it as the process required for it to be in a container. This is misinformation.
---
No, it's just a video game, so whether or not it's that badly off is 100% subjective because obviously some people don't overreact over minuscule errors.
---
Wow. 
---
You've graduated from failing miserably at being clever to also failing miserably at spelling, punctuation and grammar. 
---
Number of fanboi's and white knights that encourage more of the same from Bethesda and others?
---
Before you worry about trying to rally consumers to send a message to the game industry......
---
Maybe learn when the fuck to use an apostrophe and the difference between "then" and "than".
---
Wait, did you only play 2 hours or is this all a story you made up? 
---
&gt;oneshotting everything though, jumping (or even flying with Strange In Numbers)
---
Makes the game absurd, I mean, scary monsters with six legs, giant insects spitting blood, flying bats the size of a truck screaming yellow confetti in my face minutes at a time, bloated zombie glow sticks.
---
But I draw the line at being one shotted in the face by flying clowns with explosive shotguns ;)
---
Can confirm it works, at least with Fallout76.
---
CLIPBOARDS!!!!  I *need* them!
---
Yeah man they can't like the game
---
If you, a teammate, or just some one nearby uses a vats targeting hud, can cause crashes. Do you see pink glows around enemies before you crash? Bet you do.
---
After figuring that one out I have not crashed at all.
---
Before I traded for my TSE I was running away from high-level enemies and burning through junk to repair my underpowered weapons.  RNG has yet to provide me much in terms of viable weapons so far. Weakening TSEs is all good and well, but non-legendary and 1*s should be able to get you through the game - albeit not as easily - imho.
---
This was from weeks ago when it was duped. I never got into that duping stuff, but I did buy from who I assume were dupers. 
---
Anyway, they have since patched all of this, so what is your problem??
---
:( oh well. I got mine at 40, next time around I guess. We could get one trade probably but I can't be doing with all that.
---
Kinda where i'm going yes! 
---
My initial thought was like that zombie type in 'The last of us'. 
---
Read somewhere that it was inspired from a mushroom that take over ants and make them travel as high as they can get and then a new mushroom will grow out of it's head. 
---
It either allows a bird to eat the ant and shit the spores somewhere or have it release it's spores better from up high.
---
Really fascinating!
---
Sick of people like you spreading BS thats all.
---
Is there a way to tame cats and send them to our camp?? I know we can do deathclaws and other creatures but what about those little cats that need a home?
---
For free. XD
---
Haha, sounds fun. But let's get one thing clear...
---
I am the supreme.. Bahaha
---
And insulting other people makes you lose your credibility as well not actually explaining your reasoning behind your original statement except to say that you've played a lot of games. Kinda sounds like the method our POTUS has been using for the last two years.
---
Loved that episodeüòÅ
---
Prototypical problems- unable to load holotape into the fabricator
---
Place a Camp fire, under the "light" section of workshop. Get a small water purifier (the one that goes in soil), rotate it above the campfire and it will let you place it. Boom, purified water and nowhere near soil or water.Same for crops, they grow on the camp fires too.
---
I'm going this way, I'm even finding medium 1h too ponderous, I love the speed of knives, just need to find a good one.
---
It could never be duped. That requires it to be in a container. And it cannot be in one.
---
I can craft them quite often, so I don't mind giving some away. I don't see many people using the fat man or explosive weapons in general so it feels good to see them put to good use. ^^b
---
Nice, I like seeing creative stuff like this!
---
I got the power patcher and never had to worry about those anymore 
---
power patcher + fix it good makes my armor last like 9 days between repairs 
---
that said there is a junk deposit along the fence of the south side of the whitesprings (outside nuke zone) and you can put a extractor there for springs and screws and there is a random spawn yoa gui in a cave under some rocks inside the fence you can net 15-20 springs every time you visit your camp
---
I found this is most fun when trying to get mutations and having to add/remove starched genes 487 times.
---
There was more than one was to dupe an item. 
---
And dude, come on.....2 week old post. 
---
Everything has since been patched. 
---
My ORIGINAL post was saying that it cannot be duped or stashed. The follow up comments were to OP after he said otherwise. 
---
So AGAIN, talk to him about ‚Äòmisinformation‚Äô that was from weeks ago and has since been patched. 
---
Friend?
---
Yes I know that I need industrial ones lol I constantly in need of purifier water for adhesive farm and dilute   
---
Or, if your perception is low, you step on a land mine. BOOM!
---
I wouldn't call it good. But more like average. 
---
Still, it is enjoyable but it's not impossible to understand why some people might really dislike it especially if they paid full price for it.
---
level 40 here. I noticed the game becomes more fun the higher level you are.
---
Thats what pvp is about though. The best pvp is when there is risk and reward. I want those dicks to try and take my workshops. See my name on a workshop on the map just try it. I wont make it easy for you. If you wana farm resources in a pvp area then group up with people that can have your back, but still understand there is always the chance to lose it. Be defensive, play smart, put resources that you gather from workshops away in your stash as much as possible. These pve players that wana hold workshops and run around on the map and check there workshops once per hour then lose all there loot that is there own fault for being stupid. That is the risk they chose to take so they have nothing to cry about it. 
---
You just failed biology...
---
Thanks psn Mackdaddycash 
---
BS?? What is wrong with you? 
---
If you click, view single comment thread, you will see that I told OP that the item cannot be duped or stored. 
---
He said otherwise and what you‚Äôre ‚Äòquoting‚Äô from are my follow up comments that you‚Äôre taking out of context. 
---
Learn to read. And sick of ‚Äòpeople like me‚Äô?? What the fuck? 
---
Again, learn to read. I‚Äôm not spreading misinformation, nor have I ever. 
---
600 is the stash limit
---
I listened to the youtubers and all it really did to me was convince me to not touch the game unless I get it for a really low price.
---
10$ seemed low enough and I'm enjoying it but can totally understand why some people might hate it, especially if they paid full price.
---
Treat everyone with respect, but don‚Äôt be proud that you do and try to shove it down our throats. If you are old enough to play the game, you should already know the basics. If not, that‚Äôs on you. Most people online are male, and well behaved at that. Don‚Äôt try to plant your SJW flag here, you won‚Äôt impress anyone.
---
Ive noticed that too. As others have commented, I think some only trigger by player  proximity (i.e. grafton day/ protest march, 100% chance to appear if you fast travel).
---
On the other hand, 'the messenger' just appears all over the place, and when I see it, there arent any players nearby on the map. Not to say a player wasnt there before I looked, but I dont recall ever exploring and have that event trigger in front of me.
---
And then theres the "good loot" events. Surface to air, distant thunder, and public enemy #1: patrol duty. The first two dont seem to require player proximity. Patrol duty seems like you have to walk up to the jail entrance, but it doesnt seem to work all that often, possibly because of the cooldown, but I swear ive been in the same world for over the cooldown period and still couldnt get it to spawn.
---
They hide in other people's camps
---
Colour coded vendor locations and resource depost locations also colour coded. Quite useful.
---
I read a post recently that was noting an issue with phantom budget like this.  Basically, wall/floor pieces that had things attached to them (pictures, conduits, furniture, etc) were storing improperly.  So if a floor is supposed to take up 1% and you had 4% additional budget that stored with that floor, it was maintaining that 4% usage even if you deployed all of the stored items to a new camp.
---
The poster of that thread was saying that the only way they found to fix the issue was to scrap the walls/floors.
---
Definitely try the server hop that the others are suggesting first.  If all else fails, try scrapping.
---
You bought the game the same day you wrote this post and feel misinformed by the community reviews?
---
Well, the review bombing took place as the game was worse than know.
---
Besides that most criticism revolves around its gamedesign. Gamedesign flaws are not apparent at the beginning of playing as far as I am concerned.
---
Aren't you looking down on videogames in a certain sense, if you want to score it after a couple of hours already, like you imply?
---
You are looking at a multiplayer game, which involves people and all their doings...

I‚Äôll check when I get online later today and let you know if I have one.
---
I've notice sites that only allow proof of purchase reviews are a good 25-35% higher then random websites that lets anyone vote 
---
also the game has its flaws but the hate is just people mad its not their style of game - I mean there are tons of games I was interested in saw them come out and didn't like cause it wasn't my play style - but you know what I did! I didn't stalk the game making fun of it thats what yup I just walked off and got a different game.
---
Honestly most of the rage seems to be this circle of rage of false game stories that people who don't play think are true and when you try to explain to people they are not true you get told your just a fan boy who can't accept how bad the game is 
---
Really though, I wondered how I didn‚Äôt get diseased. Parasites? Dysentery? The dreaded Snot Ear!!! Not that you get it from food but ... poop ramen is special
---
Lol, way to roll in 2 months later. Legit necroposting.
---
That's a bummer to hear.  People pick up a game like this and have the opportunity to be literally anything/anyone they want to be, and they still choose to be creepy assholes.  
---
Day one  I came out of the vault as a female character.  Some jerks in a group pretty immediately started bothering me and 'hitting' on me, until I spoke through the mic.  Then they started screaming, "It's a trap."  They went from misogynistic to homophobic in all of zero seconds.  It was a shame for that to be literally my first player interaction.
---
Oh. My. God. I did that too. Youre bringing those repressed memories back up to the surface!

This isn‚Äôt a Bethesda thing. This is a PlayStation thing. PlayStation won‚Äôt allot games to be cross platform.

I get that.

The problem is that Fallout has traditionally been a role playing game. In real life, and I'm sure Raiders are the same, street gangs don't have a live map that tips them off to every time another gang takes up shop on a street corner on the other side of town. Real life gangs also don't travel to the other side of town to fight over turf that they don't even need.
---
My only point is to not allow someone sitting in Welch monitoring their map for workshop activity to be able to see when I take up shop in Berkeley Springs and fast travel across the map to fight me for turf they have no need for. If Bethesda made the griefers travel the map to check workshops it would be more realistic and less trollish.
---
Whats wrong with you, you could never duplicate this item so saying its been duped like crazy is false information plain and simple. I will not say anymore on this matter. I bid you farewell and will not read any further comments.
---
Actualy men are more likely to get harassed online, but women are more likely to get harassed based on their gender

 Whats wrong with you, you could never duplicate this item so saying its been duped like crazy is false information plain and simple. I will not say anymore on this matter. I bid you farewell and will not read any further comments. 
---
Its crazy, if you play with and game chat with others, they'll tell you the same. 
---
The game has its flaws, and was definitely released too early. But it is FUN, if you enjoy the exploration, and putting the story together yourself. The story is there, the game absolutely has a message. A really poignant one for modern times. But you have to be looking... something people don't want to do if some youtuber says its not worth it.

Which brings me to my other point, fair warning, get out your tinfoil hat. I truly and honestly believe that there was a concerted effort to smear this game from the start. The game's problems, while serious at first, have been blown WAY out of proportion. Other AAA titles have gotten away with highway robbery and get away with glowing reviews. 
---
I think a few key youtubers and review sites were paid, probably by a rival title's PR team. Once the hate train started, it snowballed. People figured out that hating on a AAA title gets you views, which translates to $$$ in ad money.
---
It doesn't help that Bethesda did drop the ball. Just not nearly as hard as everyone says. 
---
Lol, Theres a portapotty I saw that had a mesh cooking grill over the seat, with a hot dog on it. Desperate times in the wasteland. 
---
I think it was on the road in savage divide, maybe near top of the world?
---
I don't believe either have the recon scope unfortunately
---
I think it's so that you can't purposely/accidentally trap someone in your camp by surrounding them with foundations.  That's my best guess.
---
Don't, you're making me hungry.
---
As much as I defend the game, there are definitely getting issues. I still love the game and enjoy it and all, but these issues need to be fixed. 
---
I'm happy you're enjoying it. 
---
Wow, I wasn‚Äôt the only one who was left with a bad taste in my mouth after reading the OP‚Äôs post. See my comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ajz3p5/comment/ef00lsq?st=JRDM19PP&amp;sh=3678d011
---
I know the place you‚Äôre talking about!  Love it, got a camp set up right around the corner from there and I usually stop by to say hello to the cats and see if there are any good plans there.
---
Hahaha, let's get Bethesda to provide stable servers to each platform before we go asking for them to go cross platform.
---
Parrot-Bear gonna get ya!
---
The single most foul mouthed person I teamed with was totally female.  
---
That said, unwanted harassment is completely unacceptable. 
---
That said, I feel completely harassed every time I get pvp killed.
---
So not a lot of solid places to stand here.
---
You‚Äôre right, I exaggerated. But it‚Äôs simply not a good fit for every title. Just because a roadmap exists doesn‚Äôt mean we have *the right to see it* or something. That‚Äôs just not how the world works. 
---
His goal is to divide and virtue signal.
---
I like using the terrain for wiring too.  Instead of building a conduit tower I'll just attach the wall/floor mounts to trees or nearby debris.
---
I suspect they didn't get endgame planning done before being told to launch the game. The lack of organized endgame, the nonfunctional level counters above 99, the broken end game weapons... I rather feel they spent 4 years on the game, but tossed out a lot of work in that time, and the game had only gestated for a year or less before Command said push it out.
---
Well, if we told you then it wouldn't be a secret now would it? Your best bet it to join one of the secret armor and weapon societies, but you have to take an oath not to tell.
---
Delete floors that had turrets sitting on them.  I had two phantom turrets that disappeared from a section of floor I had them on.  I found out from another thread that scraping the floor would free up the budget.  Sure enough I scraped that floor piece and two turrets showed up in my stored tab, scraped them and got my budget freed up.
---
I bought it from a person who had 30,000 masks. How do you explain that?
---
There are different ways to dupe things, especially this mask, which again has been patched.
---
Go find some other person to try and bully about a weeks old topic and spreading ‚Äòmisinformation‚Äô. 
---
You know what I‚Äôm sick of? People like you acting like you‚Äôre saving this game from ‚Äòbad‚Äô people. Acting like you‚Äôre the only people who play and everyone else is wrong. You jump on anything and everything to make sure you‚Äôre ‚Äòright‚Äô when all you are is an asshole. 
---
I still think shadows are borked, sometimes when loading into the game there is a moment where the game looks really good with lots of shadows and detail then Boom its washed over and the lighting changes back to meh. Can only see it for a second or 2, kinda makes me think there are still issues with the new lighting engine.
---
Thanks, finally a reliable source of farmable cat meat.
---
OMG i'm on a cliffside right by there. I have to go check this out!! If you're on PS4 we could be neighbors!

Thank you for your replies you are amazing! I have taken a little bit of what each of you have said.
---
My new build idea is as follows:
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f3a55a8&amp;d=sg2c72a72a03lu2l71cu0se2ss2lt2s40sm0sn0p52sb2el2ee2s12e82s72i11&amp;w=i44c10cd1ce0pa0p80p90i30ia0i50ie2if2ij2&amp;n=
---
You will notice I have got rid of anything related to junk and replaced with level 3 thru hiker and travelling pharmacy up to lvl 3.
---
I have kept 3 points in refractor to swap into picklocking when needed.
---
I have added level 3 lead belly
---
Charisma has been kept at 5. This is because most of the time I will be playing solo (lone wanderer) and level 1 tenderizer seems like a decent, albeit slight, advantage.
---
I have removed the Power Armour weight and repair perks, opting for batteries included and First Aid (2)
---
This has allowed me to push adrenaline up to level 4
---
I do plan on eventually using mutations but as I am only currently level 18 that will be at some point in the future so a few perks will swap around as I go for now!
---
Is this build better?
---
The end-game is lacking once you finish exploring the map. I still play and enjoy the game, but I'd drop it to 6.5-7 once I hit end game. It's a bit like FO4 for me, I keep coming back to it rather than playing it indefinitely.
---
I agree put them under endurance to make it useful
---
I'm server hopping and just leveling all Whitesprings houses. I have zero caps and the damage debuff but i still do too much damage. This will teach everyone a lesson not to have bases there.
---
Followed by up to 10 Orbital Strikes from me, I don't waste more on lazy losers...
---
See I pop one into the sky whenever I get to my camp. Nobody has ever actually visited because of it, but all these flares will be worth it if I ever get someone to be like ‚ÄúHey I saw your flare and came running‚Äù
---
Ding ding.
---
I thank you for your service 
---
It's not, Bethesda just used PlayStation as an excuse to be more lazy.
---
PlayStation gave the greenlight for cross platform before the game even entered b.e.t.a and Bethesda was like "nah, it's too late to do that".
---
And if anyone thinks Bethesda isn't lazy, reminder that the reason for not switching to a new and better engine is "because we're more comfortable with it and it allows us to make our games faster" and yet, every single game they release seems buggier than the last one.
---
Haha yes
---
This is awesome. Great job.
---
ever since grabbing the herbivore mutation ive been trying to find good recipes.
---
Just found Brain Bombs. 
---
Interestingly enough i have 6 sugar bombs on me (you need 4 for each Brain Bomb) but when i look at the recipe it only says i have 2
---
In my pip boy, theyre not listed like Sugar Bombs (6) its listed twice.
---
Anyone know why this is? Only ever seems to apply to Blamco, Instamash etc all the non spoilable stuff
---
Glad to hear you are enjoying it. Ignore the negative hype and form your own opinions.
---
Be sure to do the Mistress of Mysteries questline, its one of the best. (A note on a dead girl will prompt you to checkout a mansion)
---
Shh... we‚Äôre supposed to pretend that women are under siege and that only we WHITE KNIGHTS can save them!

I'll second this at 53. When you start dropping things in a sane number of shots, its a nice feeling. Also teh loot.
---
I‚Äôve sure been hunting for any kind of legendary handmade rifle for a few weeks now. But I did get a two shot gauss rifle... gave it away to some random person on reddit tho!
---
I love the game and play it almost daily, but a majority of those 'stupid YouTubers' have legitimate complaints about a Triple-A video game with a deficit of content and a surplus of issues. 
---
Thats patently untrue. Whether someone likes the game or not is entirely an opinion. It defines opinion. 
---
It is a small water fountain on the wall inside the gazebo outside of the golf club house.
---
The main thing that pisses me off about these kind of posts is how condescending they actually are. 
---
People like this pretend to be all about equality but at the same time they are constantly painting a picture of women that could be coming straight from the 50s.
---
Women aren't weak or helpless and they most definitely don't need some rando on reddit to tell them how to respond to abusive behavior. 
---
And I also agree with your comment, the community in this game is exceptionally friendly for the most part, so I really don't see how this topic was needed from any angle.
---
So I assume this is your response for fortnite as well? 
---
Has anyone noticed the 
---
\[MAIN\]
---
fImageContrastHDR=1.7500
---
fImageContrastSDR=1.0000
---
settings?
---
Ive tried playing with them but not sure it makes a difference.
---
I find the game too bright and with little contrast/gamma in most situations, forcing gamma down on the graphics card helps but it doesnt fix how the game tries to naturally adjust brightness based on what you are looking at.
---
Any thoughts or tweaks anyone could suggest?
---
I have server hopped at least 10 times üò•
---
W... where was the squirrel hiding it?
---
I think this survival mode will solve alot of that. Most players like this will be on the survival mode. I do understand both sides. I was promised pvp so im going to find it wherever i can. Most that bought the game for the pvp aspect i think also feel the same way. Also end game get pretty boring so not much else to really to do. I love fallout76 i dont want to find another game to play. I wana play fallout76 and i wana pvp. I value everyones opinions i understand alot of players came from previous fallout games none of which i ever played. They not used to having asssholes blowing up there houses. 
---
Only 1800 atoms
---
The mods want to give you a parallel experience to the actual game. You can expect the sub to be fully functional in about a year. 
---
You're right. Its worse than people duping high level weapons and servers flat out crashing. Thanks for your brilliant insight.
---
Since the last patch ive played over 40hrs with zero disconnects. (PS4)
---
Its an online game, internet quality matters.
---
Because the game is badly designed
---
No blueprints in my storage. Nothing in my storage. It is acting like I have a hidden blueprint or something though.
---
Nothing.
---
I just sit in my one chair at the top of devils backbone with my Brahmin and listen to the radio. That is all my camp is...a chair...and my Brahmin. You can build up there it is just very difficult to design a floor plan up there and only room for a few plants. Country ass living in a country ass town
---
I found armored sunglasses....gotta protect your eyes 
---
I'm not sure what floors specificly had them on it. When I moved my camp I scrapped the blueprints into all the items they contained, then rebuilt from that.
---
unfortunately as a heavy weapons user you need to be a hoarder with how quickly the weapons break :P
---
At the time of the greenlight, PS4's crossplatform allowed players of Fortnite to play with mobile players and PC players.
---
I'd advise against going all-in with a medic/support build, as the game's current content doesn't have much need for support builds.
---
However, you can have a rather effective build based on a "medic" theme by using a plain VATS crit rifle build, along with a legendary weapon with the ["Medic's" legendary trait](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_legendary_effects#Prefix_modifiers), which causes VATS crits to heal you and your group. The most perk investment I'd devote towards the medic theme is using Team Medic, a charisma perk which causes your stimpaks to also heal your teammates, along with First Aid, an intelligence perk which increases the healing of your stimpaks. Rad Sponge is also a very good support perk to share in nuked zones, and is effective even at rank 1.
---
Play it at your own pace. I have 6 characters. You do you. 
---
3 total. 
---
It is BS....its 4 seconds long!
---
The important thing is that we‚Äôre are still allowed to critique the game, to want more and better for the money time and effort we have put in. 
---
People are far too defensive (really just the people here) when you try the above 
---
This subreddit needs mods lol
---
you should‚Äôve finished the game.
---
I‚Äôm the same way w/FC &amp; PA ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I‚Äôm ashamed to say, I‚Äôm a hoarder lolz
---
Oh really? What are they called, how much defence do they give, and most importantly where did you find them? :)
---
Ah heck you're right, my bad :(
---
Im sorry to hear that. I had an unscrapable Water Purifier stored in my camp for some time, but they fixed it with one of the latest patches.
---
Wow, I get about 3 a night. To be fair it was like that with fo4 and fo3 so I cope. Sometimes I wonder if it's something my end but I can't figure it out. Windows can be such a pain, maybe something is timing me out.
---
The people who have enough free time to dump 8 hours a day in to the game are very angry  at the lack of end game content heh.
---
&gt;Too bad I got a bit of the story spoiled before I bought the game :/
---
You *really* arn't missing much tbh.
---
I used to play the game solo (from day one if I remember correctly), because my brother didn't want to join me due to this whole negative talk about it. There was a big sale a few days ago and he finally cracked - he's been loving the game since then. As for me, there is a difference in playing solo and as a team, and that's a good thing, since different people can enjoy it.
---
We are aware of the issues and bugs, but it's not our first game that went through the polishing process, so it's not a huge deal for us. We can wait :-)
---
To sum it up - haters gonna hate.
---
HA! Man, I have this same issue ... at one point I was looting the gym in the Charleston Firehouse and I was overloaded to the tune of 800/160! 
---
Yeah, I didn't even do a real build so I started a new char, but now I am trying not to do any of the side quests to make sure a few of the weapons I get from them will be like 45 or 50. I am building a niper build, but won't do the mutation build part. I hate managing all that crap. I just enjoy exploring. I used to do long hikes for days when I lived in Colorado. It kind of reminds me of then. Sometimes I will see people fighting mobs in the distance so I pull my non explosive sniper rifle and help, or it will be like super mutants vs scorched so I take them out. I just like watching from a distance. 
---
Mate, we already bought the game. They could literally sign off an never come back, and much like EA, they could return next year and keep selling product. They could close servers this month, and probably win the inevitable class action due to EULA BS. They have choices. They may be unwise choices, but they do have them.
---
Nothing. Give it all to me üëø
---
But then what reason would I have to shout ‚Äúoh my god no you filthy bitch!‚Äù Every time my character takes a cozy nap on a bloodstained mattress in a prison full of supermutants?
---
Workshops should be like camps.....you shouldn't know if and by who they are occupied.
---
I also don't think you should be able to see what level other players are. I'm at 120 and nobody has ever bothered me but they seem to be picking lower level targets.
---
It sounds like survival mode will be doing more to make PvP actually be challenging. I don't think someone loading up on assassin's gear and reading an issue of US Government #4 and popping bobbleheads and overdrive before fast traveling across the map to raid an unsuspecting victim who just spent 25 caps 3 minutes ago  to farm some crystal is challenging.
---
Hey man. I couldn't find it. Could you post a picture from the outside ?
---
I want to join
---
I'd say the game is way more PvE than PvP. There is pretty much no way to get into PvP without pretty much harassing someone.
---
Some crafting recipes use it (Underarmors, Power Armor mods), and it's used to make Fusion Cores.
---
I'm pretty sure I bought mine from HF.

Lots of games let you do whatever you want with friends, but actually have systems and gameplay to support that.

I appreciate what they've tried to do but bulldozer is shit, we need to be able to manually scrap items in our camp whether it's rocks or abandoned campsite items.

They are only client-side, but still worth it. Have a look on https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76

I‚Äôd like to know about the hardened masses too preez.

I enjoy these posts greatly

Tattered mole head provides 1 ballistic armor lol
---
Like in the Book of Eli
---
I'm not 100% certain what really causes the difference, but some have radiation and others do not, so they may be getting separated just based on this.  Happened with my sugar bombs.
---
Whats weird too is that in the official guide book it says they deal fire damage but nope
---
I wish Bethesda would explain their reasoning for having the armors like this. Doesn't make much sense the the superior versions are worse.
---
one sec
---
The best ranged DPS build right now is stealth-commando and that's saying something. A lot of weapons/perks would need some adjustments to make it as good as spamming sneak attack criticals with an automatic rifle.
---
If you can come in and bring down hours of my work building a Camp with your duped TSE why can't I undo hours of yours by taking that BS and dropping that shit in the deepest crevice of fissure prime?

They were busy fixing bugs. The early release will cause late dlc.

Sometimes you just have to show up I think they might be bugged. Everytime I hit up fort defiance that event start up even when it's not on the map for me.

Praise the lord and pass the ammunition.

Damage/energy resistance isn't localized to specific body parts anymore. Whenever you take a hit, on any part of your body, the damage is calculated against your *total* damage/energy resistance. Then, the damage taken is increased if you were hit on a "weak point" (for humanoids, their head). Damage dealt by enemies is already balanced against the total resistance provided by your chest, arm, and leg armor.

‚ÄúConnot complain about a thing.‚Äù

Are you saying you have a very high tolerance for defects and therefore do not feel compelled to gripe?
---
Or, are you saying you have not encountered one single defect in the game?
---
I genuinely want to know, because I can understand if you‚Äôre enjoying the game despite its problems; but if you have actually managed to avoid all of its problems entirely, then I want to know what you‚Äôre doing so I can do the same!
---
Ffxiv was cross platform with pc so playstation is clearly willing to do it in some cases
---
My C.A.M.P. is 9 stories tall, and OP is exactly right. 
---
Find a cliff and place your C.A.M.P. bench midway up on it. Then drop to the ground to be sure you can build into it. If the terrain is uneven try placing in lower sections, if you are getting out of work area alerts, then you know you are as low as you can go. 
---
From here you can build about 9 stories, as I just barely managed to squeeze roofs on mine. 
---
It may take a try or two if you want to be sure to get maximum height. Otherwise, just make it work. And dont build high up without power armor.
---
I loved the game up until about level 45.  
---
Nice.  Upvoted and bookmarked.  üëçüòÅ
---
Yeah I'm surprised everybody complains about how the guns and ammo are heavy (well how much do you expect a Mini-Nuclear Bomb to weigh?), but since I'm running a Heavy Build, it's a non-issue for me.
---
Honestly, people have been *literally* saying this game is the next E.T. Atari game. It's no where near those levels of bad.
---
Well, i listened and didnt look it up, so im unsure of the irony.
---
Also, thought you were the person i originally commented, hence why i thought you were thick haha
---
But what about those that have that much free time and aren't angry? 
---
If you think about it the fatman is literally fallout‚Äôs most iconic weapon ever created, to undervalue it and leave it undervalued makes absolutely no sense unless they realized that too many mirv launchers shot at one time blowing up everything would cause stability issues to the point where the animations of cars blowing up, ghouls dying, and mini nuke clouds would be too overwhelming for the server all at one time.
---
I love it as well but it‚Äôs definitely a bumpy ride. I just wish the combat was a smooth experience. Fighting gouls and shit up close is horrible
---
My brother pre order the 70$+ version and can't get his V.I.P beta codes the refer a friend section just says "buy the game"
---
A Short Handmade almost always spawns on a shelf in a little house just north of Berkeley Springs. Not sure what level it is, probably 45, but it's the only way to get a guaranteed handmade as far as I know, might even spawn at lower levels if you are low level yourself. Great if you need mods because you can just set up your camp nearby and run there each time you load in and scrap it.
---
Serums, too!

turrets, i wouldnt put 4 turrets down to protect a palace, let alone a 3x1 shack. Use 1 or better yet none.
---
In order to make Fusion Cores (though it's cheaper to farm them), or make ultracite ammo and the prime weapons that use it, or to enhance underarmour, or for a few other things, you need stable flux of different colors. To get that, you need to get raw flux from a blast zone, along with high radiation fluids, glowing masses, and hardened masses. 1 stable flux requires 1 each of those other items. Hardened masses seem to be hardest to find, and you can lose them if you die, as they are considered junk. At one point I think they were even autoscrapping, which was horrific, but now they do not.
---
I will acknowledge the problems, bugs and the underwhelming nature of the online play. Yet, I look forward to my trip to Appalachia and I'm enjoying the game. I've played at least 20 minutes a night since I picked it up Thanksgiving weekend.

Ooooo, maybe a temporary fast travel point for your team? Set it down in an area, leave, fast travel back for free-- like you would in a camp?
---
Fro. What i understand the stash limit is because too many items in the world will crash it, hence why it crashes often when people dupe. So if you had thousands of steel or something saved up them pulled it out and gave it to someone it might crash the server. 
---
Did you expect me to have your like notifications on or some shit? Gtfo üòÇ

Do any enemies have weak point that arent their head in 76?
---
To be honest, if someone pre-ordered this and didn't expect the launch to be a shitshow, they have no observational skills. Never mind that it's Bethesda, famous for rocky launches and bugs, their emphasis on how "experimental" this was and the slightly uncertain detail delivery should have made it clear that they were buying into a risk.
---
I'm personally not going to permit myself regret until summer. I expected six months of problems before something reasonable was delivered. If summer hits and there is no significant PvE additions, then I'll consider my time done, and even so, I've gotten my game value out of it (my standards is a penny an hour, which is quite good compared to many other forms of entertainment).
---
Thanks for explaining. I've just been dicking about really, already had a bunch of codes I got from ghouls and scorched that self-destructed. Decades of not being used and they expire after days of me having them, great. Wasn't expecting that, but I was just glad they didn't explode and kill me

---
I violently agree with everything you said, especially concerning caliber and cartridge characteristics. It makes no sense that the same bullet if fired out of one gun does significantly less damage than it fired out of a different gun (10mm pistol vs 10mm smg for example).

Yes i use both of them but  energy weapons dont seem to be effected by gunsmith normal guns last for many days

For a moment I thought the second guy was me, lol.

I just tagged a legendary robo, and somebody came up and finished it. We gave each other hearts and went back to the brotherhood watoga trader. Like a minute later another legendary came out, and I knew the other player was nearby, so I crippled it and kept trying to get the other guy to come over. I waited like two minutes, then killed it. No remorse.
---
You guys may not know but a youtuber tried to activae the beast by launching a nuke right on the mine but did not lead to anything. So far he has not found any worthy nuke area besides the two we all already know of. This is pretty disappointing to me and kind of a missed opportunity for Bethesda. The nukes are already boring IMO and you can only afford so much ammo for the queen.

Who said raids cant be completed solo? Who said they cant be randomized? What this games needs is something fun to repeat to keep people playing. As of now there is no real end game, and most people think pvp hurts the game.
---
So the stash is in place because they weren‚Äôt sure how to increase stash size without it effecting the servers. It started at 400 then they raised it 50% to 600. Doubtful they will increase the stash limit again any time soon. 
---
Oh wow, ok that makes a lot more sense! I just found the Fusion Core plan and noticed it needed each of the 5 colors in nuke zones. I'll definitely not scrap them anymore (oops) and do remember that they were autoscrapping. I was scrapping them for the ultracite to build ultracite PA, but this changes my mind on that lmao. Thanks for the explanation!
---
 What platform are you on? 
---
Practical i would say
---
My main source of plastic is...
---
Nowhere. I just collect passively.
---
But now I'm gonna start using Morgantown High School.
---
Yeah I've been enjoying since the beta, and have rarely experienced any issues. Most of the time I just log in, play, and everything works as intended. Level 113. 
---
*Exactly* like New Vegas on release. And 4 on release. And 3 on release.
---
Damn. Have to get myself another weapon. 
---
Do you happen to run any mods?
---
Only asking because i run mods and wanted to see if we had something in common. I'm tempted to just delete the game and do a clean install. It's drastic but.. if it gets the results i'm hoping for, can't really complain right?:D 
---
 i've been getting alot of crashes as well, had two last night during a prime nuke, i cant even play let alone log in if i'm anywhere near posidion energy plant ( dosen't CTD at any other power plant).
---
Didn't Sony announce Cross-play less than a month before Betheda's intended release of fo76?  What did you expect Bethesda to do in such a short time frame?  They'd have to renegotiate platform deals and make large changes to their servers, integrate APIs for a cross-platform experience, etc.
---
Bethesda also expressed a desire to keep their engine because of their massive support for the modding community, given that it's something they're already familiar with.  You seem to be oversimplifying the narrative to fit in your opinion that Bethesda is just lazy.
---
So, I don't feel like playing for awhile after this one. ...I keep trying to love this game but some glitches really push the fun out of it. 
---
I bought a mod from a vendor (auto grenade launcher long barrel -Raider train station) and went to deposit it in my stash at camp and it just disappears. Not in my inventory, not in my stash, just my caps down the drain for trying to pimp my weapon out. 
---
I've also lost quest reward items and other items i cant replace by dropping them on the ground and the bag not being there or 'fell through' the map.  
---
If you like shit out of place you would love that now power armor paint that looks like it was sponsored by crayola.
---
Annnnd never mind.
---
Why even have a shack?  Until about level 40 my camp didn't even have a building.  I just put a bed, crafting stations and water pumps directly on the ground.  If it was ever attacked the repair was cheap.  I was hardly ever attacked though.
---
I am on PC.    I think I am going to park an alt over at Harper's Ferry to get around this sort of issue.
---
True. But this further shows how bad the TS nerf is. It reduces the amount of viable non-Vats builds. Combined with the Overdrive nerf, they really seem to be pushing everyone to go the same small handful of builds next patch.
---
Fuck that. 
---
I paid full price for the game at lunch in its worst possible state. 
---
it came toppling down shortly after
---
Also read: "I play a lot of Fornite."
---
Excellent post, just what I was looking for, thanks for leaving this info available.
---
God bless Reddit.
---
Hey Alex, this is awesome! Very useful tool that is also visually well-designed. I appreciate the effort you put into it :)
---
Omg lol. 
---
lol theres millions of plastic and steel at whitesprings, and 90% of it is always there
---
2 hours played with half an hour spent in one building, 9/10 GOTY.
---
Glass shards, take more damage but reflect damage?
---
I wouldnt say they are useless cause mine works just fine might take a few shots but I always get my target
---
I'm in the process of deleting everything right now... Will check back
---
But the flat ground and pre-war scenery makes it an ideal base-building location for more design-focussed CAMPs :(
---
Then again, missile turrets, in my experience, are awfully laggy, and they don't sit right with me. So I guess I have nothing to fear, if I don't use missile turrets.
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
You're welcome :)  I'm a Computer Tech by trade, it's what I do.  OK so next question, for the sake of further optimizing your game.  What are your specs?
---
Battle Royale
---
Why a third suit?
---
We also really need, the power door changed to face the correct direction, less restrictive foundations, doors to fit into door frames, triangular floor pieces to make circular builds, garden foundations, water purifier that doesn't require dirt an more!
---
There's plastic at Morgantown Highschool?! Perfect! Now I know where to loot plastic from. 
---
Not ready for the Whitespring yet. 
---
Wouldn't muzzle velocity make a difference here though?
---
Yep whitespring is best place for steel n plastic plenty of golf balls/club to pick pool cue/ball cafe tray etc 
---
I have found that 3 times and scrapped it every time in hoping I could get the paint as a mod to put on my legendary minigun.
---
You can do it Bobby!
---
I'm scrapping everything... It sucks but hopefully it will give me my main source of game play.
---
If you have no rockets your safe from me
---
As a PC player, I see none of the stuff people complain about here.  Says a lot about console demographics, I think.
---
Yep, I'm going to refine the UI further.
---
&gt; Whether someone likes the game
---
Is not what were were discussing, you can like something that is objectively poorly made
---
I fell in power armor from a great height, and then couldn't exit it. That was fun. Couldn't craft or repair, just scrapped.
---
That's when I finally put the game down for a bit. I was able to get past the inconvenience bugs. Couldn't get past not being able to repair and craft.
---
Buy and sell on reddit or learn serum recipes and sell serums stuff like that
---
X01 cuz it reminds me of a turtle.
---
I don't think the overall game design is issue. What really pisses people off is how unstable it is. You're still early in the game so you haven't REALLY experience how soul breaking this game can get. Hopefully you'll post an update after experiencing the inevitable following:
---
1. Server disconnecting mid or 3/4 through an event
---
2. Game crashing either in the middle of a boss fight (essentially wasting your ammo and stims) or right before you loot a horde of legendary ghouls
---
3. Playing with a buddy and realizing after you both zone either you or him are naked or invisible
---
4. Power armor bug unequipping a piece upon zoning and not realizing that you scrapped it.
---
5. The inability to tag enemies for XP or loot because a greedy, asshole is busy one shotting all mobs with his TSE weapon.
---
6. Server crashing right before you had a chance to retrieve your bag of materials
---
7. Playing with a buddy who wears power armor and for some reason your screen shakes when he runs
---
8. Game getting stuck in scope view
---
Give it time. We'll wait. 
---
This is the epitome of a cult following.
---
The Gods literally just vaporized you.
---
Where does it say real money?
---
Anti-armor is a really good effect in general, because of how spongy enemies are. It stacks with weapon mods and perks too. It‚Äôs been slept in a lot but I think that will change after two shot and explosive get nerfed soon.
---
A lot of this game is heavily slanted to favor melee characters.  I had a list in my head at one time, but to me one of the clearest indications of melee builds being favored is that there are about 5 foods that will give a boost to melee damage.  They all stack to give a 60% increase to melee damage!!!  It would at least be understandable if they used hard to find ingrediants, but they don't.  It's ridiculous.  No foods that would be of benefit to ranged characters will stack.  There are several that increase crit damage, but none of them stack.  AP regen foods don't stack (would be of great benefit to sniper builds who use VATS).  Melee builds presumably have high STR so they can carry more yet foods that boost carry weight don't stack for the rest of us.
---
You forgot the link

I got 32gb of ram oc‚Äôd to 3000...hz? I think, with cl 14, an i7 8700k delided @4,9ghz, an msi gtx 1080 aaand windows 10. I installed it on ssd first but it seems to run better on normal HDD for me. My screen is the Asus rog pg279q, 1440p 144/165hz
---
Well... skills really cant make the armor drop its mostly your time and luck
---
Definitely turrets, I don't have any, and just build one during battle if I need it... Though I rarely do. 
---
This annoys me too. Just bad UI that devs never bothered to fix or didn't know about it until we all started hitting 100+. I'm a programmer and do a lot of front-end UI stuff and this is a simple change. They need to make the box's width dynamically based on the size of the text. 
---
If you don't mind the being overencumbered for a little bit, each of the nuke silos has about 150 lead worth of dumbbells in a single room in the first section, it respawns every day, set up a temp camp outside the silo before you go in to quickly get rid of the 600+ carry weight those dumbbells have
---
Excavator for the hoarding and mat runs.
---
It doesn't have to be well made for you to enjoy playing it. There is plenty to enjoy about it. It's just a very, very, *very* badly made game. 
---
Not on the level of like, Bubbsy 3D, but maybe Freerealms
---
Yeah but its a bit small everyone seems to be saying on this sub
---
And I thought the Ritual Mask was cool.
---
Yeah right they wont be adding anything new until March they said.
---
Thank you very much for coming forward with your good experience. There are some who constantly try to slander all PC gamers as overwhelmingly misogynistic, racist, homophobic, etc - it's getting old.
---
Really? Shit!
---
Antivirus knows what‚Äôs up
---
Yeah my level 40 BB does 340 damage. For comparison a non legendary level 40 does 339 and a level 50 does 362. I still use it because the targeting computer is really handy. But I just got a two shot level 50 that will officially replace it once I put the targeting computer on that. 
---
Ikr, this thing looks awesome
---
Yeah that also makes alot of sense.
---
Does [Nuka Cola Paint Job for T51b Power Armor](/r/fo76/comments/ag7a9o/) count?
---
Yes it's in place because too many items in the world will cause the server to crash.  They've said they'll increase the limit above 600 when they've stabilized the servers.  I wish they'd just ban the dupers and be done with it.
---
Yes, but it depends. 10mm was designed to be shot out of shorter barrels. You won‚Äôt see much increase in muzzle velocity from a 4‚Äù barrel to a 7‚Äù to a 10‚Äù. Something like .357 magnum or .308 will see a great benefit from longer barrels. I think we‚Äôre getting into territory we don‚Äôt want to be in through. Should barrel effect damage too? What about muzzle attachment?
---
I'm equally concerned about a level 24 with a 1000 cap bounty as I am a level 5 with a 5 cap bounty and a level 247 with a 50 cap bounty
---
ALL of them are getting toonked with my guitar sword
---
One point. You get 40% chance for the first point, 20% for subsequent ones. Not worth ranking up, IMO. 
---
Although... do you get 80% if you carry two level 1 cards? ü§î
---
Crazy to think it has that much impact.
---
Hoarding is a hobby. Hopefully when vending arrives it'll be my job. Have so many good not great legendaries in my stash. Had a tse sold it for enough caps to get signs and letters. I.needed.them 
---
Have several explosives and two shots but neither is near as powerful as the tse I had. Felt like I was as powerful as I should be against pve. Just that it made nothing a challenge really. Wish they could strike a good balance 
---
I just thought it was because placing the steps is so finicky people would have to jump up to their doors. I've only been able to place steps once at my camp.
---
Blackbird X01 with Jetpack (as they fly) or Stealth mod, as they're also stealthy :-) 
---
Much, indeed.
---
I'm getting the feeling you want to be a cannibal, which is totally fine. Good sir up there gave you good advice pairing it with lead belly.
---
However, in my opinion, strictly from an efficiency standpoint, if you're taking thru hiker you won't need either of those perks, as you can carry all the food you need.
---
But honestly? There aren't any other perk cards you really *need* to put in their place (although I'll put in another good word for Fireproof, which lowers Scorchbeast and Explosive damage substantially).
---
Another consideration could be dropping Adrenaline back down to 1 and replacing it with Gun Fu. Doesn't seem very fitting, but it works with melee in VATS as well, and most situations where you would benefit from stacks of adrenaline you'd benefit from the flat 30% boost as well. But that's only if you find yourself using VATS often.
---
Damn. Hope it goes well for you :)
---
Thanks, not come across any supers yet but will look out. 
---
"Two Broke Girls has nothing on this enthralling story of Vault Riches to Wasteland Rags" - 10/10, IGN
---
This is one of those things that I didn't realize how much I needed it until I saw it. Now how will I ever live without it.
---
I feel much the same. I'm holding out hope that they get their shit together and make it into a great game, but they keep digging deeper. They're completely oblivious. 
---
I wanted so badly for it to be good. It just isn't. 
---
haha...so I did.  need more coffee.  Edited to include link. Thanks!
---
You rebel you.
---
Same with my .45 when i was like lvl 30 lol
---
You should report it. Every bit helps
---
Drunk as hell but no throwin' up
---
Half way home and my pipboy's still blowin' up
---
Today I didn't even have to use my A.K
---
I got to say it was a good day
---
A kind of flipside to that. Approaching 700 hours in. Many, many Scorchbeast Queens, even more nuke zones. Mostly in pacifist mode and yet I still play every day for multiple hours. 
---
There's nothing wrong with you buddy, but there might be something wrong with me.
---
That level 24 probably has an op weapon that lets them one shot you. 
---
The least they could do is activate some more events in the mean time while they fix their bullshit. They have to have a few events ready to go at least..
---
I craft mini nukes because they don‚Äôt require springs unlike missiles and grenades. The MIRV is fun when it works but you kind of need to use VATS otherwise it seems to miss all the time.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt complain about a damage buff though. It should devastating anything and everything 
---
I have a two shot I use alot it's a great aoe killer. I do find I use it more at SBQ fights though to help clear large waves of scorched while people concentrate on the SBQ.
---
*Cannot connect to server*
---
*Loads into new server*
---
Lock is already opened from somebody else
---
not necessarily wanting to be cannibal - just found so far that I run out of food and drink very fast or end up getting lots of rads as a result. If there is an efficent way of getting food then I might be more likely to opt for that (though probably keeping lead belly to avoid rads)
---
Still finna try
---
Yeah, it's actually worse.
---
So I deleted everything... EVERYTHING. And now I'm sitting at 110% stored and can't rebuild a damn thing.
---
I bet you wish you could cut me down WITH THOSE ANGRY EYESSSSS
---
Because Bethesda sucks at making games now.
---
Protectrons. They are more vulnerable at the torso. 
---
I think the plan for raider dense mod can be sold by vendors. I believe I saw Chad or one of the two by top of the world selling it recently for like 115 caps
---
I have an extra one. Still need a bomber jacket, plans for Stone benches, Domestic Kitchen Tables, Radiation Emitter, BOS officer, non leather heavy armomr
---
6 characters? I'm really impressed you can do that.
---
Hey I just wanna build a big house with a bunch of crops on the ground. No cops to stop me. But the monorail might
---
T-60 I think it looks the coolest. Especially with my Patriotic paint. 
---
Explosive weapons are already useless in pvp if you stack the right perks and mods on armor itll be melee vs melee and snipers vs everyone
---
The first great PVP battle of fallout 76... builders vs non builders of whitesprings lol
---
Does that apply to fusion cores used by The Gatling laser or just for PA? I would like a 1000 round FC.
---
Next patch is going to be pretty bad. The only competitive ranged build will be sneak+crit (which is more overpowered than TSE, by far, due to how the multiplication works).
---
Sigh.
---
I believe its bugged. I currently rock an unyielding set with 1 chameleons an I can stealth crouch. None of my other armor pieces have the weightless or chameleon.
---
Which brings up my question.  Can you just paint the torso and not the limbs?  I think it would be pretty badass for a level 100+ to come into a PVP fight with ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Play‚Äù on his chest.  I don‚Äôt have any paint plans, and am basing this question based on Fallout 4 paint schemes.
---
I built my camp outside that house. All the cat bowls = shotgun ammo
---
I love freaking out newcomers with my ritual gear but this is even better. WE NEED IT!
---
&gt; Bethesda Gods
---
No, Atom.

I feel you. I had a time when I was set up next to a lead extractor and needed acid constantly. Now I moved to a new location but cannot break the habit of grabbing anything that contains acid.
---
They are AoE damage weapons, they clear crowds better than bouncy ass grenades. I use them all the time at queen fights so my mates can focus on nuking the boss.
---
Learn to play.
---
It‚Äôs really not that rare
---
I feel like 20% of the time I‚Äôm in fallout is either loading screen or game crashing/glitching/lagging
---
Ikr it looks so cool, its like a gas mask
---
The console is unforgiving to perk management üôÅ
---
Nice! Thanks 
---
Turrets take up so much more than some people realize. It's ridiculous, I don't bother with them either. 
---
They can't figure out why it keeps desyncing. So they just took it out entirely I guess.
---
I‚Äôve seen the same, one character I have a hud, and was crashing like crazy, but I took another toon in without one and still crashed 5 mins in. 
---
Same here. A lot of the problems/glitches other people report with the game, I have never really experienced (or at least not to the degree others do).  And I play this game a lot. Maybe more than I probably should, to be honest. (On xbox)
---
This... This would be amazing
---
It looks great!  I'll try to take some screenshots of my favorite recipes later when I play.
---
A couple suggestions for further improvement:
---
* Consider allowing for a checkbox that applies the effect modifications for "Herbivore" and "Carnivore"
---
* Maybe this is the same feature as above, or a different one, but being able to sort/filter by "Herbivore modifies this recipe" is really beneficial.
---
* Maybe add another filter for "growable". Two of my favorite recipes are Sweet Tato Stew and Vegetable Medley Soup because all the ingredients (except salt and sugar) can be grown in my garden, so I can have each within a minute of loading in.
---
* This is probably the craziest suggestion based on the amount of work it would take for you, but it might be neat to be able to say "these are the recipes I want to make everyday" and have it recommend a spot on the map near as many of the ingredients as possible to drop your C.A.M.P? 
---
Keep up the great work, the community appreciates you. : ) 
---
Agreed, but they need to find a way in the normal mode to keep the griefers from destroying camps of people who haven‚Äôt fired a shot at them.
---
And next patch this will be even more true, as the rest fall even further blow. Sad times.
---
The other issue i see beyond the whole sony/not sony debate is that the decision to go with a staggered update/patch schedule screws with cross platform.  Suppose Bethesda could go back to a single release day, but with how rocky the updates have been do you really want them to do that just so everyone can have cross play?
---
1 really bad patch &amp; it's more cross-notplay for everyone across the board
---
Well that‚Äôs 40 caps well spent for lots camp items to scrap üòÇ 
---
As a lvl 127.... I absolutely agree. It could even be displayed like the "get the supply drop" does, with a small area to look.
---
I think that people are tired of all of these always online multi-player games that can be stuffed with micro-transactions. 
---
When people think Bethesda, they think Skyrim &amp; Fallout - incredible single player sandboxes with great characters. This game was not what most people want to see from Bethesda - couple that with a buggy as hell launch, and you get people chomping at the bit to trash this game. This is not a terrible game (though it is buggy), but it's no means great either.
---
I'm not talking about quest. They were going for a mmo lite type of game (think of destiny without the hub and the actual end game content). It's fine that they went this route, since it is a spinoff. My issue is that it's an mmo lite without any true end game content.
---
To be honest, I think the biggest problem overall is that they tried to make everyone happy but it didn't work. You cant make a traditional fallout without NPCs and dialogue options. You cant make an mmo/mmo lite without any actual end game content (raids are really needed) and a central hub. You cant make a survival game without having a true lack of resources and constant stress of dying due to lack of resources. Basically they tried to make a hybrid of all of these types of games but left out all of the things that are core elements of those types of games that make it work. Fallout 76 has no identity. 
---
Also what the hell is the point for even going full multiplayer? The only time other players are actually needed are when you fight the queen. Not a single other time do you need anyone else to help you. This game should have just been a co-op game with human NPCs since people want to play with friends.
---
I didnt realize that they took up so much space. 
---
I have been on everyday the last two weeks (minus a day or two) and I only was able to pay uranium fever one time. Just the one time. Then I had a three star legendary spawn, I got super excited and smashed the hell out of it with my All rise and guess what? It didn't drop legendary loot... 
---
The more you play the more you see. It aint perfect but i still love it. You just need to wait n' see. 
---
I've found late in the game that my pockets are overflowing with Radaway. You may have a different experience as a melee though, to be fair.
---
As far as food, since you're doing mutations, you should choose either Carnivore or Herbivore. Carnivore allows you to just eat what you loot off animals, Herbivore let's you eat stuff you farm at your camp (and dog food if you want to double dip with good doggy). With Herbivore, you can also make soup, which will cover food and water.
---
That's a matter of preference on eat-as-you-go or prep yourself a little bit at a time. 
---
Hey look, when I deceide to sit down I have made up my mind. Come hell or high water I will take my time and sit down fully.
---
there is just now way for me to walk past an enamel bucket and not pick it up, same with fans
---
Same here  had it happen when i made an announcement here to kill SBQ. I killed myself and got stuck on loading screen with no rewards 
---
I cant FUCKIN tame them bc i dont have wasteland wanderer yet i want a cat
---
&gt;Stop looking at it like a single player game where 'I payed $60 and got 20 hours so it's a good deal' and look at objectively as a game design failure from Bethesda
---
Why would I? Sure, it's probably a big fail for what Bethesda intended, but it is a great game for what I wanted. What matters to me is that I'm having fun playing it. I'm at 200 and some hours in and still have about a third of map left to explore.
---
In order to make Fusion Cores (though it's cheape...

I have been using it to make fusion cores mostly.
---
well when when they stack damage bobbleheads so that they do 100,000 damage or more a slap of 100,000 is still enough to one shot someone.   
---
They really need to look in to how bobbleheads stack.  I am not saying dont have the stack at all but set a cap or limit to the stack or at the very least set a cap on the slap damage
---
I paid full price and have played since launch day. Even before all the patches were put in place, I still didn't think the game deserved the level of hatred the Internet Rage Machine was bombarding it with.
---
Yikes... I am so sorry, definitely didn't mean to make it worse.  I haven't seen any other solutions  posted besides that one.  Did you try moving the camp after?  Maybe that'll do it?  :/
---
It's all scrapped and I'm sitting at 110% stored still... My decongestant showerüòñ I'm going to have to grind those Matt's back

Hey! Im friends with you in game!

I mean even with those, other weapons kill 10x faster and weight much less.

Suicide bomber scorched 
---
So full of ultracite or plague they are bursting at the skin 
---
Just make a whole new build and leave the cards there if you ever feel like playing melee or whatever you can
---
My house is suspended over the edge of a cliff, and I'm able to walk around the edge, even though I have nothing built to support me. It's irritating to walk near the sides of my house, since a lot of objects have random invisible barriers, so I literally get stuck between my lead extractor and my front door.
---
Oh.  Shoot.  Didn't mean to ruin the story for you. 
---
Suffice to say that it's reasonable and not immersion breaking that the pip boys are tracked. 
---
It's also not a stretch that tracking could be turned on or off.
---
Having the ability to appear on the map or not adds a level of gameplay.   Is the lone guy really alone,  or does he have a friend or two lying in ambush?  Or maybe he's got the route to him mined.
---
A game where single purpose is hoadring is punishing you for hoarding.  
---
Yep, makes total sense. 
---
A giant, boss-level Short tailed shrew. Irl it has toxic saliva so that'd be badass after a nuke 
---
Phew. Carry on, then
---
Oh ok. Even so it would be more options available if we could have armored headwear. Unless their idea of allowing choice is to have everyone in power armor because that's your armored headwear right there.
---
That's fair, just thought I'd point out that it would make 'a' difference, even if it weren't a significant one.  And I dunno, I feel like a lot of people are getting tied up in trying to make the mechanics of this game make sense in more realistic terms.  Perhaps Bethesda does need to do some re-balancing, but I'm not sure that should mean changing the system from the ground up.
---
Maybe in the earlier levels yes. It feels like levels in 76 after like 100 are a flat rate which is fine since one of the dailies is always to get a level. Fallout 4's levels were on a pretty aggressive curve to encourage people to start new characters. 
---
I‚Äôll post this again as it did not come up in the right place before.  I reiterate: @MD_Teach - you are an unbelievable fuckwit.
---
Other than the semi frequent crashes, maybe once every three hours, I haven't experienced anything game breaking. 
---
The biggest problem I encountered was the Evan respawn, which has been fixed, I think.
---
Yeah, I moved it... The only item I still have is my mirelurk king... Can't scrap him unfortunately. My decon shower was a tuff click but it's all gone, I guess it's break time till the next patch comes out.
---
I feel really bad for you if that is the case in France,
---
I lived in multiple countries, and yes there are some jackets that cost higher than 300, but leather jacket, and yes, also lamb jacket are extremely overpriced at 276$.
---
as soon as I get on today im going there
---
It demonstrates just how little effort was put into the game when minor things that would take a moment to fix remain broken months after release day.  
---
There's no evidence that anyone working on fo76 gives a single shit about it.
---
Pvp? Oh you mean the completely pointless part of the game where you get a few caps and useless junk while the other player comes back to do the same thing over and over again? Pvp scares no one. There is literally no point to it because the rewards are basically nothing. Pvp is really just for being a troll.
---
My TSE Shotgun and TSE automatic anything is superior AOE. Superior DPS (exponentially). Superior accuracy. Superior vs flying mobs.

Please do not tell me to learn to play while you use the worst weapons in the game and waste everyones time in SBQ.
---
Because. "It Just Works"
---
Nope. Cuz u guys ain‚Äôt doing it correctly. U need to do it in a clown suit repeatedly ... until one day u kill a wendigo that‚Äôs wearing a clown suit then the quest will finally disappear. And next morning u look at urself in the mirror , u become a wendigo 
---
So long as they make it something that isnt a scripted, one-best-method, typical MMO Raid, that's fine, I agree.
---
Homophobia - the fear that a man will treat you the way you treat women.
---
I've had that invisible teammate issue as well, sometimes it's corrected by going through a load screen, so fast travelling, entering some of the buildings that have load zones, that kind of thing.
---
I think this would make the game far to easy. Instead, I feel that each point of strength should give 3% extra base melee damage, pistols should get an armor penetrating perk, rifles should get a weight reduction perk, and energy guns should get a durability buff. It would also be nice if having all of one type of damage perk ( Rifleman, commmando, etc) would give a special bonus, like lowering movement speed of hit enemies or causing bleed damage after an attack.
---
I'm married to a hottie and have a 2 year old. Maybe a lot of guys that do this do also, or would say the same. But my wife is Italian. Pretty sure she would stab me if I ever said anything inappropriate. Before going for the cast iron. lol. Which I wouldn't. 
---
Sorry you had to have that experience! I'd just he excited to find someone who A. HAD voice chat ON [PC]; who is a gamer without a mic? B. Would just send a team invite. Seriously not that worried about my camp. C. Wasnt in PA for farming. The roleplay with costumes is so fun.
---
Or the hatred of the game has been so blown out of proportion that people are honestly shocked when they play it and actually have fun.
---
Of course not, neither is the perk in strength. It's a video game, things just don't get lighter just you are awesome at a certain thing, thats not how physics work.
---
 I just wanted to point out why it would makes sense in intelligence for example.
---
Where do you find pieces of the x-01 I have not seen any. 
---
Same. I think part of it was that people were lumping the disdain for the dumb shit Bethesda did (like the bags) in with the game being bad or whatever, when really the bags had nothing to do with the game. It just had this swell of outrage that all seemed to be about the game, when most of it actually wasn't.
---
Jesus. 
---
I do the one in ash heap. Its pretty easy an usually drops them not far away.
---
&gt; This game has been playable with a few bugs since last month,

Seriously, they need to replace whoever comes up with the ideas for the shop. We want more rugged survival stuff and less tutti-frutti.
---
One can dream, i hope this happens one day,,, bureaucracy is what stands in the way.
---
must be nuts in the head to like that shit LOL

This is the trick on how to do it. I attached a half wall to the floor and the roof is attached to that. 
---
Most likely, people bought them from others who got them from dupers. A little difficult to find a tse weapon legitimately.
---
Great you are enjoying yourself. 
---
I bought it a while back and its good, people make it look bad because you know band wagon hurr durr.
---
There are tech issues from time to time, like all of the games, but with each update the game is getting better and better
---
You are talking about cats.  They tame you.
---
I do have a Field Scribe‚Äôs Hat available. My PSN ID is rennocthegreat. I‚Äôll be online this afternoon EST.
---
No, I am not using any mods. I‚Äôm tempted to because I‚Äôve been modding Fallout since forever, but definitely not doing it this time around. 
---
Alternatively, they could be made to scare off particularly diffictul enemies, or there could be ultracite flares that force scorchbeasts to land.
---
After you get to the stage you are at where you can actually hand it in, the quest only reactivates again if you pick up the "Technical Data" from a different container and back into your inventory.
---
Those you currently have in your inventory? Kinda useless now. I had over 40 and was a bit annoyed I couldn't spam the quest over and over.
---
The solution is to give one to a trusted friend. They put it in a random container in the world (not one you own - or at least owned containers didnt work for me - ymmv) and then you take it out of the container. This should activate the mission again for you and you can then hand it in again.
---
Pain in the ass I know but it's designed that way.
---
A lot of people hated fallout 4 due to the dumbing down of the dialogue options and the extremely limited options available to the player. The game was going away from an actual RPG and became a looter shooter. Now fallout 76 comes out with literally no dialogue and zero options for anything. Having multiple dialogue options and having multiple outcome options based on player choices is Fallout, which these games completely strayed away from. 
---
At least understand the reason why the games are hated. 
---
I think it‚Äôs because bunker buster affects only the missle launchers base damage, which is 15, and not the explosion that‚Äôs created when the missle impacts.
---
Takes the fun out of helping others and joining up with randoms. 
---
you can't hoard like in fallout 4. i am not very far, level 27. so far i have not had a problem since i only pick up what i need or i go on a crafting spree. however i am starting to see how the size limit is going to become a problem as higher level items take more materials. 
---
Nukes and dragons back at it again with functionality
---
My sweet summer child..
---
If he told you he duped over text chat you can screenshot it and send it to Bethesda.
---
The weird thing is that they haven‚Äôt fixed this yet. Like, it‚Äôs a simple fix and relatively minor but annoying as hell. 
---
There‚Äôs 2 raider vendors near top of the world. One at train station and one inside the resort that sell a fine selection of raider stuff. I checked these two a lot for PA mods 
---
making soup seems a good idea might be worth a look at!
---
Jesus fucking christ the insane apologies and excuses people have to make for this company lmao. 
---
&gt; They told you up front this wasn't going to be a polished AAA release, it was an experiment.  You knew this.
---
What a ridiculous statement, if it was an experiment, then they should‚Äôve charged experimental pricing, not full AAA price with $18 microtransactions and $200 collectors editions.
---
&gt; There's a certain point where you need to release to make any real forward progress.  I'm happy they released when they did since it greatly accelerated that progress.
---
Or they could be a company with integrity and honesty and delay the game, continue public beta tests for free and eventually release the game in a stable state with content molded by feedback from the community before charging $60. Kinda like how Nintendo just announced that MP4 wasn‚Äôt living up to their standards and they didn‚Äôt want to release it like that so they‚Äôre scrapping the entire project and starting from scratch with a different studio. That‚Äôs called integrity. Something Bethesda doesn‚Äôt have
---
There's also a house just northeast of Morgantown that has 10 mounted cat heads on the wall and piles and piles of cat food bowls.
---
One of the heads is unique, too. It's black.
---
When they decide how many atoms it will cost I guess. /s
---
Nice idea but it wouldn't work out as planned. They need to focus on killing bugs in the game. 
---
Most likely, yes. However they do actually drop. I was pleasantly surprised when I got a tse 3* gatling. Unfortunately I don't use heavies...
---
In reality,  barrel length does affect muzzle velocity.   A lot.  Muzzle velocity affects terminal velocity.   So there actually is something to the idea that different platforms can have different lethality. 
---
What annoys me is that the handmade rifle which is modeled after an ak 47,  shoots 5.56 ammo.   It should shoot .308 (which is the same as 7.62mm.)
---
5.56 is used in the m4/m16 which sadly does not exist in the game. 
---
Finally,  projectiles do not travel in straight lines when fired.   It would be sweet if that were modeled and scopes could be adjusted to compensate.  Or at least make the marks in the reticle correspond to mils or moa.
---
Definitely. I personally want the game to be much better as the game wasn't what I was expecting it to be, and I didn't really like the idea of an always online Fallout, but I know it has potential and have had fun with it so far, we just don't need 100 hot-take posts about it everyday because it feels like we're just going in circles at this point.
---
Adhesive is still ingrained from fo4. I keep picking it up too. 
---
I only found this recently, I was using the bunker buster before that and it worked just fine
---
Yup. Bought mine lol. I‚Äôve only found like 3 two shot weapons and 1 explosive weapon. Never any tse. 
---
*Sony would like to know your location*
---
I‚Äôd be happy with any rifle with a decent effect at this point, all I get are instigating unarmed and one handed weapons...
---
Dude this is an ingenious idea. Glad people like you are a part of the community! If you wanna play fo76 on ps4 lmk psn: JoShEr103
---
I also noticed some cats on the hill above the nuka factory.
---
These are very good suggestions. Thank you!
---
PvP servers will make for a better game, by far. Play Fallout 4.
---
Yup. It also seems like pretty low hanging fruit for the backlog too... So that gives you some idea of what that backlog looks like for them to not have bothered yet :/
---
tbh I wouldn't even mind a scorchbeast plushie in my camp. That's the kind of stuff I would actually consider buying with all these atoms lying around
---
A hazmat suit :P
---
Lmao. Realistically might be 500 feet. Just as useful. 
---
Yeah Im pretty much the only member of my group that actively plays with other people or helps people. I've been playing with this group I'm in since beta. It's pretty discouraging to try and help people and that's the return you get. I should of known when I was trying to ask the level 10 if he needed anything and I couldn't hear him. It said he was already in a group when I tried to invite. I'm pretty sure he was one of those level 150s that showed up.
---
I guess I have to change my name to Nobody. 
---
I craft them all the time, because I roll around with 3 different legendary Fatmans (Fatmen?). 
---
I have gotten pretty good with them to where I will use them indoors to clear rooms when I go to launch a nuke. The MIRV is especially good for this. 
---
But I'd be happy to take a damage boost. 
---
Extractors now give you ore instead of the raw material for metals
---
I never really found two shot powerful by itself while explosive depending on the weapon can be powerful alone. And weight can still need weight reduction so power armor, fusion cores, heavy weapons, etc don't weigh crazy amounts.
---
It's part of the Not Giving A Shit school of game development.
---
That was just them glitching inside the model to show us it's true face.
---
Yeah same, I would love it if we could add it to legendary versions.
---
"testing"...what is this word of which you speak?
---
Well, so i have to ask to a friend, to see if he can help me.. it's a shame also because i always bought the technical data from vendors knowing that there is this quest
---
Where has been the best place(s) to find screws? I used to run through Sugar Grove and end up with a decent amount, but the last dozen or so times it‚Äôs been depleted. 
---
Any suggestions for a guy starving for screws?
---
I found my TSE Revolver in a Whitespring nuke zone. My lever action rifle TSE was bought off a vendor bot up by Top of the World.
---
Havn't botherd with pets for this reason, why is this taking them so long to fix, yet they are adding new content before the game even works.  Tons of little easy fixed bugs yet they leave them.
---
Power armour bug
---
Assaultron head bug
---
Pet bug
---
Unremovable foundation bug
---
Bethesda plz fix
---
Thanks! But I'm on PC :)
---
I'm really tempted to make the airpod joke, but I need to be better than that
---
I second this!
---
All cats have rank 3 Wasteland Whiskerer
---
Try clearing your cache.
---
Don't forget needing perk card to reduce heavy weapons from 40 to 4 weight.
---
I think they need to do something with explosives as well. It's stupid that you're basically forced to go heavy weapons if you want to make an explosive build because the only really strong explosive weapons are heavy weapons, and grenades can't get legendary traits.
---
Maybe they could add Grenade pouches that you can equip as weapons with legendary traits that then apply to the grenades you throw (And you can throw them with a click). 
---
Missile Launchers should not require power armor to have armor piercing qualities. The whole point of a missile launcher is that it's man portable and has no recoil. Doesn't make any sense to gate a significant chunk of its firepower behind power armor. 
---
It's also stupid that the M79 grenade launcher is worse than the Mk19 in every conceivable way. It weighs more since it has no weight reduction perk, and has maybe one twentieth the rate of fire. Give it some fancy magazine mods that let you fire all sorts of special grenades that catch things on fire or freeze them or whatever. Also make the sights on it display a fire arc like when you're tossing grenades. 
---
Yup - same ... I just wish there were more to do because I can only rebuild my camp so many times before that gets old too.
---
Guilded minifgun can be found at either the hornwright or Garahann mansion, it‚Äôs a mini gun with a unique paint job, spawns in the shooting range behind a level 3 locked door.
---
You‚Äôre trying SO hard to sound smart and yet you still sound un-fucking-believably stupid. It was hilarious to read these comments lol
---
Complete the Enclave Questline and you can craft it similar to Excavator
---
If this happens to you more than once, it‚Äôs on you.  It took me twice to realize don‚Äôt log off without changing into my hazmat suit OR don‚Äôt log off at Whitesprings.
---
AFAIK you don‚Äôt get more perk points, 
---
Check your ‚Äústats‚Äù on your pip boy and look at the Special there, it should have +/- in parenthesis
---
Any hints on where to start that?
---
I‚Äôm not sure what the answer to this is. A missile launcher should instantly kill you if you aren‚Äôt wearing power armor. A Gatling gun would be mitigated by armor since Gatling guns used older black powder cartridges with unjacketed bullets. Miniguns guns should kill you basically instantly unless you‚Äôre in power armor. Pistols should be basically useless if you‚Äôre in any armor above leather. It‚Äôs going to be interesting to see how they choose to handle this. 
---
That‚Äôs how my 4 work as well, as do my crops.  You wait long enough and everything will be full though.  
---
Are there any other perks on it. 
---
Protest March is broken about a third of the time. You show up in the alley and nothing happens. 
---
Hahahah
---
Phionex in watgoa sells t51b mods
---
For the most part, I don't think so.  There are some kinds of damage - notably explosions - that can end up one-hit-killing you.  Other enemies, particularly the Colonel Gutsys, are apparently equipped with armor-piercing rounds.
---
Agreed. I love the hell out of the concept of this game. But the live team needs to step up the game if they want to compete in the online rpg shooter.
---
Only when you're 35, paying off student loans for 2 degrees and still making damn near minimum wage...
---
I've only experienced three bugs while playing, all on the same server. There was a scorched on top of a roof, a flying trash can, but the only one that made me upset was resting then reappearing Midway through a wall, causing me to have to quit.
---
Yeah, I feel your pain. I had a lot saved up too but you are better off just finding them in containers around the world now.
---
I've not tried it this way but if you both went to the basement where you hand it in, you could just use the containers there and try and get through the ones you have already that way. Worth a shot.
---
I'd be interested to learn if you get it done like that.
---
I like fighting up close and personal. I find vats quite easy to use. Have you gotten the perk to target limbs? Headshots make a world of difference 
---
Rumor is sitting down fixes it.  Haven't tried that yet though.  The invisible teammate thing is inconsistent and somewhat rare for me.  Definitely have gotten it a few times though.
---
Iv server hoped almost 100 times or more for other mods and haven‚Äôt seen them there
---
Thanks for the suggestion, will give it a try 
---
1). Using radaway could cause one or all of them to be removed. 
---
2) why are you buying them from Modus when they go for &lt;500 on the market. 
---
I‚Äôm satisfied with the sentiment, thank you! ;)
---
Orbital strikes have been limited due to furlough days...
---
Thanks! Corrected.
---
thats up for bethesda we just plant the seed of idea :D
---
I'm a mid 60's lvl and I spawned at my camp when starting the game to find 3 scorched beasts trying to have their way with me. Was not a good time, I don't recommend it. 
---
Hey it‚Äôs you!!!!
---
More events and better loot drops would be great, for everyone. 
---
&gt; It doesn't help that Bethesda did drop the ball. Just not nearly as hard as everyone says.
---
The first patch screw up  really changed the tone of things.  Seems like Bethesda ramped waaay back on community interaction and started playing cards much more closely to the chest.  Seriously wonder where the game would be now if that had gone off smoothly.
---
Yeah I'm probably approaching 400 hours but had a fraction of what other people experienced. To be fair that's probably why I like it more than a lot of other people!
---
Most problems were during the beta anyway. Weird textures and missing objects. They were fixed after launch when I had a graphics card driver update. Turns out that's what it was.
---
I'd love to have Drinkin' Buddy along for this ride. Plus I could use a good joke now and then.
---
They are getting nerfed to be on par with other legendary effects 
---
I'm still trying to get that pic to come out just right, but good is never good enough.
---
Vats to me is very clunky. Enemies lag or glitch around up close. Shots don‚Äôt register right. Some input lag. Just not a smooth experience at all
---
Please do write his name a publish it next time! So we can Hunt them down a teach them some manners :) 
---
It doesn‚Äôt solve everything, but it helps.
---
This is all I want for a mask.
---
I've had that happen once. I've also had Swarm of Suitors bug out on me twice, once I got literally no reward and the second time I got a mundane swtichblade. 
---
You do
---
If you find youre repeatedly being griefed at your base.. Try and stay crouched during your time in it. Especially if your base is off the beaten path.
---
Griefers have been known to notice people hanging around empty spots on the map for too long. If you stay crouched and hidden, i believe that your name wont show up on the map.
---
What dmg are u getting on those weapons?
---
the satisfaction killing a level 200+ withh an explosive god weapon with a regular weapon at sub 50 is pretty good tho
---
I'm at lvl 84, and I still have to encounter my first a-hole. Overall, most ppl that are playing are so friendly. 
---
I'm one of those ppl that when I have to much .38 rounds stored, I keep an eye on the vault, and if I see a new player getting ready to emerge, I wait for him at the entrance. As soon as they come out, I wave and drop about 1000 bullets, purified water and radaway. That'll get them started üôÇ
---
So I can kill you without TSE Weapons in 2 shots in you Power Armor. Ever heard about the Tank Killer Perk at Perception?
---
Power Armors are pretty useless at PVP :) 
---
I will try.
---
I cannot simply drop all the datas i've found.
---
Mine comes and goes.  Today was pretty bad - got 3 in the first 30 minutes of play.  Other times I'll put in an ungodly number of hours without a hiccup.  
---
Doesn't seem to be much rhyme or reason behind it.
---
Power armor is not a part of a serious pvp build at this time. 
---
Yea, the launch codes reset every real world week. Not sure what day. 
---
Can give you ritual headpiece
---
Headlamps are just for cosmetic purpose as far as I know .-. helmet has its mod
---
Hey again, I have like 30 pounds cores want some
---
Like what? Did you miss the fact that patch 5 nerfs Two shot and Explosive very badly? Those weapons don't ruin the game, they just need balanced better. Being instant killed is bad, but so is bullet sponging.
---
You sure it's exactly ritual headpiece ?
---
We plant ideas for bethesda whatever they will do its gonna be better than it is right now... beacuse my flare gun is rusting in chest
---
I‚Äôll hop on and take a few
---
1) Don't buy serums from modus. You can find them much cheaper from other players. Usually under 500 caps
---
2) Without starched genes equipped, every 5 rads you take has a chance to give you a mutation. If you literally only took 5 rads and got a mutation then you are very lucky or unlucky depending if you wanted it or not. 
---
3) Your character exists in a nuclear wasteland. Getting random radiation damage is pretty much a daily struggle. If you don't want your mutations to change then you gotta keep starched genes 2 equipped.
---
4) If you equip starched genes rank 1 and take a radaway or use a radiation shower, it should only drop one mutation. There is no way to guarantee which one of your three it will drop though. Good luck!
---
Yes, and that's why they are getting de-buffed soon.
---
Although, IMO, the best way to address this would be to elevate Explosive to be a top-tier legendary mod, like Two-Shot, so you could never have Two-Shot Explosive in the first place.  The Explosive effect, on its own, is fine in PvE (it's hardly game-breaking) and I fear that taking it down by 80% will make it feel pretty useless.
---
PvP yes pve no tse weapons should do less damage in PvP but more in pve now after the patch scorchedbeast are going to be more annoying to kill
---
You do.  Every time.  The tally might not pop up but you always keep the cap.
---
Bloodied, increased crit damage, crit meter fills faster would be my guess 
---
Dont get me wrong this is not like GIVE IT TO ME RIGHT NOW its just an idea that dev can maybe see it and write it down and later on add it. I agree that we need a cleanup of exploits and bugs first
---
Oh it‚Äôs not a ritual mask. Sorry for the lack of knowledge
---
Ok sounds good
---
Welch station has some outside, 
---
I screenshotted both of their names. His exact words were, "I don't care if you report me do you know how many people tell me they're going to report me and nothing ever happens". I'd post their names here but I don't know the rules on that.
---
Even without Herbivore, Razorgrain Soup fills both meters really solid. It also fills thirst a little more than hunger, very convenient as your hunger meter is slower to fill. Can't recommend it enough.
---
Np, a common mistake
---
Glad you‚Äôre enjoying it, but two things to consider:
---
1: At launch the game was riddled with game-breaking bugs that turned a lot of the player base off. These bugs took months to fix and many of them still exist.
---
2: You just started playing. Once you reach the end game content (or lack thereof) the game gives you less and less of reason to come back to it.
---
That being said, overall I‚Äôve enjoyed my time playing Fallout 76. As a life-long fan of the franchise it‚Äôs been interesting to explore a new era through a new play style within the Fallout universe. I hope Bethesda with continue to polish this game and turn it into the gem it could be.
---
Hawke's Refuge in the Mire has some.
---
Haven‚Äôt touched 76 in a while but I could have sworn you do get a cap. If this is not the case they should probably fix that as this is the deal with almost every fallout game.
---
Extreme luck.   I‚Äôve gotten a few two shots,  only 1 TSE and hundreds of garbage legendaries.
---
Same with incisor perk. Some melee weapons will just ignore 100% of armor.
---
üòú
---
A related note:
---
If you take rad-x, it will suppress all your mutations until it wears off.
---
This would be perfect for my character!
---
Explosive weapons are not good in PvP if opponents have Dense torso and Fireproof, but really good if they don't have.
---
Exploding bullets should just spread the damage in an area, not get damage buff. It would be enough to get aoe effect to your weapon. Two Shot should reduce fire rate as well or only that to make it fair.
---
Damn I would've got it on PC if I didn't need to go buy a new power supply :P
---
B-b-but dupers! They're like bad and stuff so therefore we need to make all the weapons complete shit and rely on crutch VATS builds to actually do damage! Makes perfect sense!
---
Sweet idea. 
---
Also, is there an option on the char. planner to click a playstyle/weapon or whatever and it will give a premade optimized build that you can then tweak instead of having to pick the card, then stars and such?
---
Doesn‚Äôt work with empty bottles....... jk
---
I have had that happen, but I also have had the opposite (missing material) and the craft will work. Especially yellow flux.
---
I want to say I read at some point that their production per hour are all linked. So if you have four, cumulatively they will still only produce 5/hour. However you'll end up with 20 after 4 hours instead of 5 if you only had one purifier. I never really verified myself though.
---
I got one off of a super mutant and bought another from a friend. The handmade rifles are what I can‚Äôt seem to find. 
---
can you grow razorgrain as havent seen it at my camp?
---
if taken as a survival game with no relation to any Fallout game it's a meh game, but it completely lacks many of the things that make a Fallout game Fallout.  there is no irreverent comedy, no interesting NPCs save for Rose, every quest is heavy af because everyone is dead, it's just depressing af, this game makes me (read: my character) want to slit my wrists, it's lonely af and everyone is dead, listening to holotapes is just plain depressing
---
Camden Park
---
All I can say is energy type weapons are very weak currently. The developers know and will buff them soon. Flamers are terrible because low durability, and low damage. After the two shot nerf, having a Two shot flamer is like having a ghoul slayers gamma gun. It's useless. Also explosive flamers don't gain explosive damage from demolition for some reason.
---
Same :‚Äô( I been looking for that and shocks for T51b the whole night and this morning also free states but it‚Äôs all excavator/t45/t60 mods or T51b shitty mods. Do the mods even exist?
---
Good call. Shotgun ammo is rough with that plastic requirement
---
Most people who really dislike it haven't even played it, let alone paid for it. xD
---
You have camp building advice? I‚Äôd love help not having a box tower
---
I doubt he actually has.
---
I strongly dislike C.A.M.P griefers, but make an exception for Whitesprings, especially when turrets are present.
---
  It‚Äôs a known popular farming spot, peeps should know better.
---
Rock on!
---
I have the t51b calibrated shocks plan I got them from Phoenix so I know he has those but I haven‚Äôt seen them since. I‚Äôve already used them
---
&gt; What matters to me is that I'm having fun playing it.
---
And that is why I'm glad you aren't in the reviewing business.
---
Because these developers are amateurish and lack talent?
---
Money and in game currency are two different things dude
---
Yeah it's pretty fun.  One player gifted me a Vampire's Bowie Knife that provides a little health regen on every hit.  Well, when you hit *a lot*, you can tank through mobs and still end up with more HP than you started with.  It's pretty cool.
---
I also have a Furious Deathclaw Gauntlet I like a lot, even though I'm not entirely convinced the Furious effect is worth it.
---
But i cant use them for perk cards
---
But Rad-X diluted will not
---
At least that's something I can do on the meantime until they can fix it
---
Just yesterday I died after a brutal SM fight, game hung on my re-spawn.  Had to hard boot and LOST ALL MY JUNK!!  Thanks.
---
Agreed, they made Bethesda Plz to stop the front page being flooded with the same 12 posts every day, yet it still happens daily
---
No they played it. That's the sad part.
---
FYI from the recent inside the vault
---
&gt; With Patch 5, the damage bonus for Two Shot Legendary modded weapons has been reduced from +100% to +25% damage ~~and the Two Shot legendary mod can no longer be looted in the world~~. The Explosive Legendary mod has a reduced damage bonus, now adding +20% of the base weapon damage with explosive radius damage instead of +100%

Yes some random shitty mods not optimized or shocks :/ I ve seen shocks for other PA there tho
---
This is my first time having this issue. I generally don't pvp people cause who really wants to lose caps and have to lose all their junk. The times I have been attacked I can usually defend myself pretty good. But this was ridiculous his tse handmade literally destroyed my x-01 power armor on his first shooting had a helmet left. They made sure to destroy things like my decontamination shower and things that are expensive to fix. My team mate tried to help he has a tse shotgun but these guys weren't in power armor and literally took no damage from him. Idk it was just crazy. I feel kind of pathetic staying crouched to avoid people though. 
---
It isn't a glitch...
---
This is the way how we live. Be proud, people!
---
That layout is beautiful, hope you can datagraph other aspects of the game with this as well.
---
It was voice chat.
---
I have a 100 mbit/s connection (nominally, 85-90 mbit/s on average) with an excellent ping and over 99% uptime. I have disconnects regularly, It hasn't much changed since the last patch.
---
Yesterday I locked in first session, had to log out again because of bad lag. Like shooting enemies and their head exploding 2 seconds later. So waited a few seconds, logged in again, took over a workshop, disconnect before the defend workshop event started. Next try log in, wait 10 seconds until I could move, immideately disconnect. Cried a little, cursed a lot, ate dinner and played CK2 for the rest of the evening (which led to more cursing, but thats not the point).
---
Yeah, like when you drink Bourbon or take a Buffout you don't get to put in more perk cards either, it probably works the same way as that ? 
---
Well this makes sense...
---
When I got my explosive flamer it initially had 280 dmg..not bad, but that number flashed out and now stays at 46. They have already nerfed these weapons. Sux given how hard it is to find them.
---
That's called poor QA and if you're seeing it all the time during development that is a problem.
---
No, you can't gain perk points from armor or consumables. It's only a stat. Perks are not affected at all. 
---
Man, dammit! I know this is an old post but, was having the same issue as OP and it started right after installing the HUD on the excavator PA. Sucks knowing that I spent days trying to find the MOD and materials to install it just to have to remove it. Anyway, just wanted to concern that the targeting HUD is the issue and warn people not to install it until it's fixed. 
---
Same thing with ballistic fiber at Camp McClintock.
---
If they're dual layered socks for running, buy as many as you want for me. At $15 dollars a pair, I'll accept as many as you can afford. There is nothing better than dual layer socks for preventing blisters past mile 10.
---
I had my camp here forever and loved it but the cats are treated like enemies, so it affects fast travel and your turrets will kill them :/
---
Oh god no.
---
Raw yellow cake.  Easiest one to get.
---
Wait, there's some sort of mechanism in the game that dispenses robots(?) named Cole?
---
The reason I hate it is because it is an absolutely pointless, joyless, and time waste of a game. I have spent hours doing stuff, only for the game to crash, and lose everything I did. 
---
The end game is terrible, and even the leveling part isn‚Äôt that great. Scorchbeasts are the most boring, least rewarding boss I‚Äôve seen in a game. 
---
While I don‚Äôt dislike the perk system, it‚Äôs still another Bethesda game filled with tons of useless, and even more redundant perks. 9 damage perks in one tree? They really should make some perks secondary, and always active - such as hacker and weight reduction perks. 
---
No thanks. Luckily I got RDR2 for free when I bought my FO76 / xb1 bundle. 
---
The biggest complaint I have about this game is actually how it was marketed. 
---
Fallout 76 is what is called a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). It is an empty shell of a game, that was sold as a complete product. I, and many others, had a lot of faith in Bethesda prior to this release, so I was happy to preorder the collection edition. I actually preordered it on PC and XBOX. The game came out, and it had some fun-ruining bugs, but it mostly played Ok. But by the time you have like 100 hours into it, you‚Äôll find yourself wondering why you still play it. It‚Äôs just not a fun game. Maybe if you play it like an hour a day, you‚Äôll get six months out of it. 
---
Oh yeah, and inventory management has never been a fun mechanic of any game. 
---
With all the numbers we are given on our weapon stats, you would think someone would actually do a damage per second calculation for some empirical analysis.
---
All of these ‚Äúranged weapons suck‚Äù posts fail to bring any relevant information to the table. It is all just anecodtal.
---
Ok, well I'll be getting rid of these useless weapons. By the time I find a TSE if ever, itll be useless too.
---
I felt the same way about FO4. After the general public outcry was "bad story, terrible game" I just kept doing my thing. Had a blast with that game, too. I'd agree with a lot of the story criticisms but the world was awesome to explore, settlement building was a cool addition (I remember using a mod to do similar things in New Vegas), and even when some of the story beats failed, the story locations were still detailed and well done.
---
With the reaction to 76 being even worse, I now believe that the Fallout fanbase has a sincerely toxic aspect to it. I don't know if I've seen such whiny, unforgiving, self-entitled people before. xD
---
Op said that
---
It's not the only issue, but yeah crashes have reduced since. Still crash sometimes though.
---
This is almost the exact same way I got Marsupial.  I got disconnected from the server at the RobCo facility and when I came back, I got a burst of radiation from out of nowhere as well as Marsupial.
---
Unlike you, however, I *didn't* have either of the Starched Genes perks.  So that led to a rather interesting meta-game where I had to gain 2 levels without taking RadAway or taking further rads.  Suddenly, the lowly Feral Ghoul became the most dangerous thing on the map.  I managed to do it, without Power Armor, and it was pretty rewarding.
---
Later on, I found a legendary Lever-Action Rifle that increased movement speed when I was holding it.  That, in combination with Marsupial, makes the game feel more like Mirror's Edge or OG Doom than Fallout. üòÇ
---
Dang. I haven't found that at all. It always takes a second to settle know your target but once you get good at swapping targets and limbs it becomes smooth. It did for me at least. Just couldn't imagine playing with other vats now. But I'm a rifle and shotgun build that being said. With a little melee when needed. 
---
Agree completely. Something dynamic would be great. Different paths to take. Could even have a changing story and different end bosses depending on choices you made. 
---
Back to these threads ey? As siin as the front page is majority criticism or complaints -these- posts soon follow.
---
Interesting.
---
I haven‚Äôt tested it but I am fairly certain it only applies to power armor
---
I only do it to the Whitesprings or people who attack me
---
It's a small cosmetical trick on how to make second floor fences complete with the stairs.
---
Wish I had that kinda time
---
I would def advise against it. You wouldn't want to add another variable into this whole crashing mess. 
---
Agreed.  I‚Äôm an IT Manager at a Fortune 500 company, and I strongly suspect budget and developer resource allocations force prioritization of limited resources   The game was way to far down the path to simply change course, turning on a dime is not possible without more $$$ and time, not going to happen.
---
Well it's fixed before it's released.  It's ok for things to be a bit off during development.  
---
Yea the plan can also be picked from some PA crafting bench as well. But mods are easy cuz no perk/ mats required 
---
nope
---
On survive or both?
---
It is, but not having to build near water is a pretty big advantage.  
---
Oh, okay
---
I do not dispute anything you said, I will just add that this game is depressing as fuck.  literally anyone speaking on a holotape is dead, just depressing af...
---
Oh i definitely agree about these players stacking bobble heads. I seen a guy 3 shot a a Scorchbeast Queen how ridiculous is that. He said he was stacking bobble heads.
---
    Just because the workshops says its owner is a lvl 30 doesn't mean he is not grouped up with a few high lvl friends with 2 shot ballistic weapons. There is not any way to know if that low lvl is grouped up or not. My opinion these low lvl players should not even be doing workshops solo. There is so much to explore and do and it is not hard to find all the loot you need in other places. Im also lvl 120 i played and lvled up through the hole game without the need or use of workshops. It is a lazy man way to gather resources. I agree it is nice to use but it was intended for pvp. It was not intended to be a pve location. If Bethesda wanted workshops to be pve they would of made them that way. If that was the case pvp would be....Well there wouldnt be any good pvp.  Players would be hunting your houses even more looking to instigate pvp.
---
Sadly, I agree.  It sounds like there is many more game breakers in there that are getting all of the attention of the developers.  
---
Becuz u must underestimate me when im level 20 and wanted. (actually 200) XD 
---
 How about some pics?  Sounds pretty cool.
---
Yeah, good thing I play it as a gamer and not as a business development consultant
---
1. I personally don't use cannibal anymore, but I hear its better with the carnivore mutation. (I have 1 endurance and use radicool instead). Corn soup is my go to and I offset its weight by putting deep pockets on my armor.
---
2. I don't know.
---
3. No, sadly.
---
4. Balance is good, my balistic and energy resist are both around 230, but the major energy attacks you'll face will be SB(Q) and you'll probably be in PA. 
---
I'm still waiting for my fusion generator to spawn fusion cores... Fusion generators are. Supposed to spawn fusion cores per hour I think its 8 an hour...
---
I try, but a few times in the bunker and the server disconnects, when you load back in you get loaded in a nuked world
---
It‚Äôs like skulling in the wilderness in runescape. Never more intense then when you risk it all.
---
Too bad. Can you even build anything now?
---
Yep, I assumed so.
---
Such long and complicated answers when the reality is 99.99% got them from dupers or second hand from someone who got them from dupers. Suuuuuuure! you can get one legitimately, just as you can win the lottery. Chances are you won't, and if you do, it'll be something stupid like a broadsider.
---
yeah i cant store levels without this annoying pop-up. 
---
It's not an episode! I'm super cereal! ManBearPig is real!
---
I've seen two versions of some pre-war foods. Brand new looking boxes and dirty boxes. Like how some outfits have a clean version. I haven't noticed but I'd bet the dirty boxes of food have absorbed some radiation 
---
Come at me then
---
Have you played Skyrim or FO3? Those games were crazy buggy. And who cares about the micro-transactions. They are cosmetic, you don't have to buy them, and you earn atoms in game. Plus you don't speak for everyone. This is exactly what I wanted from Bethesda; A fun open world game that I can play with my friends. 
---
There's a mod that fixes this on the Nexus.
---
Good point.   It‚Äôs at those times I just log off and wait for times that the game is less played online and load in.
---
&gt; It makes no sense that the same bullet if fired out of one gun does significantly less damage than it fired out of a different gun
---
Makes a lot more sense to me than how picking up and putting down a card suddenly makes the law of conservation of mass mean as much as used toilet paper.
---
Ah, good to see you RMT duper trash again !
---
The sales are not approved by anyone
---
Consider yourself lucky. From my experience your are not the average, but the exception.
---
Yeah, and good thing you decide to weigh in randomly in a thread where the OP is talking about reviewing.
---
Hey! I‚Äôm selling them for 25 caps a piece. (Sorry for the delay) 
---
I get one every time. 
---
Never know I might already be
---
Both, the nerf is coming in the next week or so, survival beta starts in March 
---
You put a /s on there but you, me, and everyone else knows this is true. 
---
Bethesda showed their true colors when they cut content from the game (that was already in the game) and then put it on the Atom Shop and charged money for it. That's up there in scummy moves with anything EA has done.
---
Nice to hear.  Sounds like your spouse/partner/parent/child/boss is a very fortunate person. May you keep enjoying the bliss!  Or, if the case may be, have a nice day trolling.  Seriously, though, I'll have what you're having.
---
I have a Bomber Jacket available. If I get the Army Fatigues from the other guy, I'll still be willing to trade my Bomber Jacket to you for something else.
---
Get this rather regularly with my friends. Have tried the trick where you let them load into a building first with little success. Will try sitting and report back.
---
I had 2 people griefing me last night too.  I wonder if it was the same ones because it said 10 but he had a full set of pa flamethrowers etc
---
If Destiny did anything right, and they‚Äôve done a lot right in recent months (like the Last Word coming back Tuesday), it‚Äôs raids. They‚Äôre always at least somewhat challenging and fun. With matchmaking and a few tweaks that‚Äôd be a cool addition to 76. 
---
Imagine having to fight your way into a cave or mine where a giant Deathclaw and her Scorched or Super Mutant handlers are somehow bonding with her offspring. Maybe there can be parts where you can build turrets and defenses or something to incorporate building into the raid.
---
How about a rabid Yao Gui that‚Äôs three times the size of a normal one that a bunch of robots have ‚Äútamed‚Äù and are using it to help fulfill their corrupt programming? Maybe they can be some kind of firefighter robots and the bear will be a Smokey the Bear kind of situation (lol).
---
Vault-Tec vault opened in Appalachia where an experiment has gone horribly wrong, maybe? Maybe the dwellers turned into a new type of enemy, with various mutations and what not, and want to spread the mutations for what they see as survival. 
---
I‚Äôm just spitballing here, but you can write the stories. That‚Äôs not an issue at all, I‚Äôm sure. It‚Äôs just a matter of implementing it in an intuitive, fun, and rewarding way. 
---
Was going to say this.. Lol.. Hay Bethesda clearly op is a duper...
---
PS4? If your username is the same I will let loose on sight. No tasty man meat for you.
---
I agree with everything that Real-Salt has said. I‚Äôm still a believer in putting extra points into luck for more critical damage if you‚Äôre using vats 
---
Ah nice to hear. Thanks.
---
Depends on your definition of weak point.  For almost anything big, their legs are the better target.  *Then,* the head. üòâ
---
Yes, reviewing a GAME and if he enjoys PLAYING it
---
You know, the same as I did
---
I had a player stab me to death with insane slap damage while wearing that. I imagine they got it from the dev room or the like.

There are programs and games that suffer from this but, I have not found a solid solution.
---
Best lead I have at present is to do with Multi-Threading applications, so am checking in Microsoft forums to see if there is a  M$ Hotfix for Windows 7 64Bit.
---
This is on top of server disconnects. 
---
they were nerfed because they were being exploited
---
Yeah it‚Äôs ridiculous 
---
Just trying to convert my cynicism into sarcasm these days. Looks like I need to keep working at it.
---
I agree. Everyone complaining about the bugs must have never played any other Bethesda games. They are always buggy. Plus they talk like this is the only AAA game that is buggy. Every game that has come out in the last 5 years has some bugs that need to be worked out.
---
Only a synth would assume it was a synth. We dont serve your kind here 
---
As much as I love playing this Beta of a game, by the time they actually start to release content after all these bugs that should have been squashed before release it will be too late. Most of the non-diehard fallout fans would have moved on to one of the many AAA releases in the first quarter. 
---
Like most have said in the past, this should have been released early 2019 and not rushed just so Bethesda could cash in for their Fallout in Space game.
---
I expect downvotes due to this reply not being a pat on the back for a AAA company that doesn‚Äôt have their shit together.
---
TSE will still be pretty powerfull after the nerf. Just pick the right perks 
---
West tek, not always, but just did a run and got 3* super mutants, 3 of em. 
---
Until that one time in a daze you forget... sadness.
---
Welcome to the console experience üòÖ
---
Totally agree, the current meta is broken with regard to infection chances. Every successful mole rat attack hit results in an infection. Ridiculous in my opinion. I usually just ignore diseases and tough it out. 
---
http://imgur.com/gallery/b8gcMSR
---
Yeah I got to the point where I stopped lock-picking and hacking things unless I was with a buddy. 
---
Just wasn‚Äôt worth picking every safe for 30 pre war money and a pipe pistol.
---
Thanks for your input. I'm conflicted between marine armor and heavy metal armor
---
The world building is way better than the rest. I'd even dare say that this is the best world they have buildt. The enviroments, the locations, the atmosphere. It is all just spot on in my book.
---
Another broke bitter bum. The game seems full of them.
---
My point is that being able to carry more "rocks" (ie. Explosives) makes a larger difference than being able to carry more "feathers" (normal ammo) given that it's already easy to carry more feathers than you'll use, but the same can't be said for rocks.
---
Because why would peole ruin and let others take their build that they worked to perfect and synergize with other perks. I wouldnt post any of my builds simply to avoid the meta switching over and being forced to find something new because taking little to no damage, being invisible almost 100% of the time and being able to overheal from near death in am instant is a pain in the ass and thats not even considering the 1 shot from always stealth that happens to all player enemies 
---
Taking workshops is still worth it. I'm on xbox, but last night I had Poseidon, Charleston junkyard, gorge junkyard, and the place with 3 acid by the water park. I'm only lvl 31, and have no legendary weapons. Just take the workshop. It's always worth a gamble to me. It's only 25 caps, and in places like Charleston junkyard or Poseidon they pay off very quickly, imo. You just have to research which workshops you need and go for it. Eventually, you'll get huge payoffs.
---
Cosmetic. And pa is usually noisey even if you had a stealth boy mod.  Don't forget to turn your radio and light off... Mobs can hear and see those..
---
Same rly. Most is just garbage.
---
You see a 3 star legendary creature and you think 'jackpot'  and then you get legendary wood armor like nooope.. 
---
If the playerbase is broke than why do you try to earn money here ?
---
My favorite mod is probably the one that categorizes and sorts all of my junk with simple and clean icons, not to mention how it shows what junk will give you when you scrap it when you hover over it with your cross hair. 
---
Thanks fot telling me! Will try that.
---
Sometimes I find if they don't show up when you hover them, when you hit transfer, they're there in the inventory, not every time, but sometimes.

---
Settlement building was (IMO) one of the absolute best things about FO4. I enjoyed the story well enough - it was no Horizon Zero Dawn, but it was enough to hold the (very beautiful) sandbox together. Far Harbor and Nuka World were fun additions to the world. 
---
I agree with you about the fanbase. Bethesda has certainly made their fair share of mistakes ...and should be held accountable and all, but the Internet Outrage Machine has blown it up into something far worse than it actually is.
---
If you're on PS4 and looking for a like-minded teammate sometime, let me know ;)
---
Same. I moved to Germany for 4 years last fall right when the game came out and my brother and I both got it so we could hang out. We were so pumped to be able to play a FO game together (both huge fans since NV) and this has ruined it. He stopped playing a month ago. Neither of us see any point in dumping time into it anymore. 
---
Agreed, they should do the same with weapons and guns via weapon racks and mannequins. Each should count toward the base budget and have their own individual storage limit but not the stash storage. 
---
Bullshit on that. Every other game ive seen has something to make it so your first entrance in the game lets you breath a little. The game is poorly designed, thats a part of poor design. Take a class on design, its all about preventing the end user from using something innappropriately. Dying with no challenge or game play is not an intention of the game makers.
---
Not for me
---
I had regular creatures  dropping legendary weapons aswell but i think it was a bug
---
It‚Äôs either a bug or it‚Äôs supposed to happen I don‚Äôt think you can sell stuff to vending machines 
---
i tend to dump my extra ammo and aids in the suitcases at train stations. someone will find it :)
---
Looks dope. No idea how you maxed out anything without turrets but maybe i didnt notice them.
---
No idea how to power my outside equipment without having my power generator outside, but yours looks like its inside. How?
---
you love it. we all do.
---
Non- legendary Marine would be better than non leg-metal imo. But if I had a full set of 3* unyeilding, I'd probabaly wear it regardless of what it was (unless it was wood haha). 
---
Yup same name put why ya addin etc etc..my days of Baggin and taggin are very busy and I‚Äôll stop by when I can my friend!
---
My T-69 bc it gets me lucky with all the female Scorched
---
Yeah I keep getting leg wood crap so I have no leg armor yet. Only like 3 weapons that I cant use due to level cap
---
I got a single shot vampire something .45 but its a 3*. And yah never seen a two shot explosive type. I do see a scrap ton of melee weapons that are 1* - 3*
---
I'll be ready.
---
Doesn‚Äôt it get reduced by explosive perks just like the grenade rifle? Isn‚Äôt that the intention? 
---
Same
---
Absolutely.   But right now it‚Äôs the state of the game.  Until they fix it you gotta adjust, continue to be frustrated or do something else.   I do a mixture of adjusting and doing something else when I get frustrated enough.
---
Think of the weight increase üò´
---
I like 76 because I get a Fallout game that gives me a story that still allows me to be my own individual. Using my microphone is not mandatory.
---
Maybe someday my guy. Maybe someday
---
Thanks for this.
---
Not a heavy weapon, explosive weapon.
---
The shed to the very right houses my fusion gen. I have conduits that take the power to the outside. No turrets, my camp is huge and has a fully furnished inside with the middle building as my crafting workshop.
---
"You look delicious."
---
That would make since out of my 5 two will be full two more will have 2 and the last one will have one or none.
---
I spent like a week looking for those plans. Googled it, camped vendors, farmed Billings Estate workshop like 40 times (heard it has a chance to drop there in particular). Never found the damn plans. 
---
I ended up posting about it and some good fellow was kind enough to give me his. After spending like 6+ hours trying to earn them in-game it took the kindness of a stranger before I was truly rewarded lol...
---
You may want to try the same thing. There's a trade reddit I believe, and you could just offer other plans or caps.   
---
If you find them, help 'em out. If they find you, be a little hesitant. The only lesson here is that folks have been saying bad people exist and now you know from your own experience. They woulda killed you regardless of whether or not you helped the lower guy. Don't let them jade you from being a nice person. Block and report them. I've been one-shot in pacifist mode many times by 3 separate people now.
---
you will be less excited when you see it's scale, it's smaller than the twin beds already in the game
---
Let us hope you are..giggles (lol even though I‚Äôm at a disadvantage cause I have to hit first lol üòÇ)
---
And hot dogs just chilling for who knows how long out in the open.  "Yes, I'm gonna eat that."
---
the "forced deadline" myth
---
It IS sad, which I personally like. One holotape actually made me cry. No spoilers, but if you've heard the one the acting manager of the Whitespring made for her husband before they left... yeah. Also, Sofie's survivor story is heartbreaking (Flatwoods). There's no hope anywhere on the horizon. I think it speaks volumes about human nature, and that drive to survive no matter how bad the odds.
---
I bet I can ruin it for you, place a regular twin bed next to what is supposed to be a king sized bed, the four poster is smaller than the twin bed already in the game
---
I saw that generator, hence the question. Eh, maybe I just don't get how conduits work. Oh well.
---
Pretty nice view though.
---
I aughta move my house and find a new fun place to exist in.
---
Sure can.
---
There's a workshop on the west middle side of the middle calling Billings Homestead, straight N from the Nuka Cola plant. At this workshop is a field of 30+ Razorgrain, collect as much as you'd like, plant a few at your camp(costs one fertilizer as well, there is a resource node at this workshop).
---
Level 13.   Or 113?
---
Use the missile silo holo tape you can check the cooldown of each silo before you go inside them. If you have lost it you can buy one from the enclave bunker.
---
Its because you are level 27.  The game gets worse the more time you invest in it, after level 50.
---
Yes! Raids with new content and backstory. 
---
maybe because not everyone is like you?
---
The majority of people I see are using melee weapons. I think they are plenty usable.  
---
Yeah, I just read the vault release...well now to have a decent gun I'll need to continue to troll for a TSE, and hope it's not totally nerfed.
---
I mean how can E and TS be nerfed DRAMATICALLY, and the TSE still be powerful.  I didnt get to play even for a bit with a good gun...I just want to be able to 2-3 shot enemies like my melee.
---
I'm sick of getting stuck in a mob beating the shit out of me and all I can do is keep pounding on one at a time. Heck, I'm really thinking they didnt calculate corectly..i mean 80% dmg reduction for TS and E...these hard to find weapons become jokes.  
---
I dont mind funny, silly stuff, but its harshly disappointing to not see cool shit go up for sell. 
---
I saw a sloth once at Dabney homestead but that was the only time outside of a blast zone. 
---
The weight is not affect by any weight reduction card.

I got my carry down to under 300 and my stash not-quite-full for the second time yesterday since starting the game in early November. It's tough, when you know how long you have to farm to build or repair a suit, or some weapons, even with perks. I'm level 130something, and still spend a lot of time in my PA suits. And of course always have to carry at least one of them.
---
Or they can just "man" up and ignore it. People are so sensitive about everything. I work in Public Saftey and I deal with some of the most vial, angry, nasty people walking this earth and I've never once been offended by anything that was said to me and trust me I've been called evrything you can imagine. People must learn that these type people are just talking at you not to you. It's for attention. So if you ignore it, it will go away.
---
The only exception is when someone is trying to physically put their hands on you or attempting to intimidate you in person.
---
Bottom line, ignore it, block, switch servers or turn off the game. So many ways to deal with bullying, whether it be cyber or otherwise.
---
I'm on PC! It's too bad, I didn't even realize until a few days ago that players are separated into platform-based groups. :(  It's weird to me that we can't all just play together, but I don't really know how networking works haha.
---
You won't see high numbers like 1k without a bloodied build.
---
Has nothing to do with tse or not
---
They make a tasty meal, but not as good as the mountain goats you can catch around the Savage Divide. If you can reach them.
---
I think other then the server disconnects and games crashes I am enjoying it.
---
Remind me again, why don‚Äôt we like Whitespring campers? 
---
I'm more pissed they took away the bounce arrows from the archer... 
---
One thing to remember that hundreds and hundreds of bugs have been fixed since launch (and there are still a lot that need to be fixed still). The game is definitely in much better shape now than at launch. 
---
There are still a lot of bugs that really annoy me. The game can have a lot of big performance dips which I don‚Äôt experience in any other game. 
---
I would have preferred if there were human NPCs. Human NPCs just seem to make me care more about the world. I feel like there aren‚Äôt a lot of stakes for me when I‚Äôm sent on a quest to find someone only to see that they are dead.  It almost feels pointless to me. It might work for some people but my preference has always been about being immersed in the world as well as the people in the world. 
---
Ja same.
---
Can‚Äôt be that boring, then. 
---
This game is like being in an abusive relationship. I get punched in the dick daily but, keep coming back for more. $100 says this is all a VAULT TEC experiment on stress management and consumer gullibility. Still gonna play though!   
---
Just the quad perk
---
I don't *like* most of the bugs, but I do agree with the sentiment that this is nothing new for Bethesda and, outside of network stuff, can be equally applied to Fallout 4 or Skyrim.
---
I think in the time since Fallout 4, critics have forgotten that Bethesda's games have a learning curve and they largely don't have the patience for it anymore.  There is a lot about 76, just as in previous games, that isn't explained well or, sometimes, at all.  Things like the perk card system, crafting, how to loot, the importance of bulking, the fact that you will be outmatched sometimes, etc.  And, if you don't know these things, and you go into the game with a bad attitude to begin with, you're going to convince yourself that you're having a bad time.
---
I think the servers are just really picky about the internet connection the player has.  Me and my buddy who lives a block away have had less than 10 dcs combined since launch. But the dcs on my end always coincide with dropped connections for everyone in the house.
---
Hahaha, I knew as soon as I saw the title that I was going to open this up to half the people complaining about there bad experience yet they are still here on the 76 Reddit. At this point yes it has become crying.
---
Anyways Glad you are enjoying the game, am on my second character now and the game is fun, I look for the "bugs" everyone talks about and cannot find them, people just want to play victim. Keep enjoying the game and maybe see you out there sometime :)
---
*aaaaaand cue the downvoting of this comment*
---
But in the previous comment you stated that the player base seems to be full of broke people like me.
---
Which means that you're trying to sell stuff to broke people, which doesn't make sense.
---
Cheaper to farm them at a workshop. I save my flux for underarmor, ammo, orbital strikes. Though violet seems to be the only one I have a hard time keeping in stock.
---
I think it speaks volumes to the stubbornness of Todd Howard.  he had an idea, "a game where every other person is a real person", he should've backed off that almost immediately, but instead he published the most depressing game ever made, and sooo many concessions were made just so he could make "a game where every other person is a real person".
---
I completely agree. Bethesda does not hold your hand in certain aspects of their games. And that is one of the thinks I like.
---
treasure
---
I guess i shouldnt care. My computer froze up yesterday playing this game. Then my computer wouldnt turn on, probably not from this game but it added to the experience. Im going to spend some time trouble shooting that and uninstall. 
---
There is no point to playing if it makes me more pissed off everytime.
---
I like shooting things with them
---
nor an explosive weapon either... its an explosive heavy weapon.

Btw this is the only site I use for perks... keep up the good work!

THIS should have come in the pocketbook with the game! How is Bethesda missing these little opportunities to make the game great??!!??
---
Someone was being a bully to my friends Daughter who played EQ at the time. The father (My friend) ended up finding this guy and convincing him to come to some area that was on the other side of the world. A quick portal/teleport there, he lets the monster kill the guy and says "Don't pick on my daughter" and leaves his corpse there, half a world away for this asshole to jog back and get.
---
So basically caps and a few non legendary weapons and armor ?
---
Maybe not. I mean have you ever seen a Brahmin without an udder? 
---
Ya your def right im n the tons of filler follout76 does have, but the new survival mode adds a whole new gameplay loop of rinse and repeat fighting which I'm all for!!
---
Lore in this game too
---
Irrational Fear was like that for me too.  One day, the event just showed up and I must have done it three times.
---
If I didn't know better, I would have said it was a new event, because I literally hadn't seen it before then in a hundred hours.  And then I went for several days without seeing it again.
---
The glowing ferals was probably because Whitesprings was recently nuked. They still spawn for awhile after the nuke zone dissipates. Either way though, you do get feral rushed at Whitesprings if you're not careful. If you play a stealth sniper you can pick them off pretty easy. That's the safest way to do it at your level without power armor.
---
Probably because they spent an hour porting over FO4 and never bothered testing anything in this game. 
---
Embarrassing. 
---
they can reward rare plans
---
i love it as an item but settlement lighting makes me scream. all the lighting is super cool-toned and harsh except for candles and lanterns and that one little modern table lamp. ceiling lighting is especially insane because it THROWS LIGHT ONTO THE FLOOR ABOVE IT FOR NO REASON AAUAHGHGHGHJKGFL
---
every light i've bought from the shop drives me fucking bonkers except for the string lights. i want that chandelier so bad because it's my jam aesthetically but i know that i'll just hate the way it casts light. ughhh
---
Great ideas! That mixing station and drinking buddy should be easy enough to bring over. I'd also appreciate a way to make drinks ice cold. 
---
They need to bring all contents from other Fallout games  to this game. Then FO76 will become a unforgettable game.
---
They‚Äôll be in the atom shop soon enough 
---
There rockets are annoying 
---
Not quite sure if this is what you‚Äôre getting at but in one of the churches you can find a pitcher, a bunch of drinking glasses, and some rat poison set on a table near the altar.  
---
Skeletons litter the room, either splayed across the floor or sitting in the pews - all with drinking glasses near them. 
---
This whole church is implied to have committed suicide together for whatever reason. 
---
Not a word about it anywhere. 
---
Just the implication from the scenery
---
Swarm of Suitors shows up a lot, and I'm convinced it's because it's just outright broken half the time.  I can be standing right on the quest marker and the event won't start.  Sometimes it will spontaneously restart.  Or the Mirelurk Queen will be chilling in a corner somewhere.  It's really quite pathetic how such a simplistic event can be so broken.
---
The rumors of it's shittyness have been greatly exaggerated.
---
All good points, I hope that they bring something for everyone tho, I'm sure this game get better in time but guess we gotta wait
---
I've been asked for free gear and help from a lot of people. Sometimes I help, other times I say no.
---
I have a explosive quad lever action rifle that I really enjoy. I went and found a bounty for 100 caps against a level 30. Easy kill, she respawned and demanded her caps back or she would report me for duping because "all explosive weapons are duped". 
---
She followed me around the map telling people I was a duper and a misogynist for killing her/refusing to refund her caps. As time went on her demands became more and more extreme. Eventually I blocked her and changed servers, problem solved.
---
Harassment can come from anyone, but there is an ignore function for a reason.
---
Map suggestions based on ingredients?! Yes! I‚Äôd love that
---
A new species, Glowing Ghoul Faun? 
---
kill super mutants, if they drop lasers you can scrap them for 4 plastic
---
also at whitesprings the golf balls give 1 plastic, just look for the green baskets 
---
That's exactly what I'm getting at, thank you.
---
Or a glowing miniature t-rex
---
Does anyone know if they give outfits 
---
Did they change the radio from 4? It's never affected stealth before
---
Very nice!!!!!

You can't equip two of the same card it would just swap them. 40% chance is ok but if I have it equipped I tend to be searching for meds.
---
Its the combination  of TSE and E that makes them so powerfull especially with the shotgun
---
Dump the laser gatlings. Due to their low damage and rapid breaking, they are really bad right now. I do hope this gets changed, but that‚Äôs the reality we play in right now. If you lose weight and perk up damage, as well as get it modded with long barrels and a speedy receiver, the Gatling gun is one of the best HW due to its high damage, it becomes very durable and ammo efficient. 50cal is close as well; if the low RoF of the Gatling gun bugs you, a 50cal can fill that itch, it‚Äôll just burn a lot more ammo. 
---
Focus. Carrying multiple weapons from different specialties at the same time really only hurts you. You won‚Äôt have appropriate perks to enhance their damage, reduce their weight, or anything else. It also means you have to carry lots of different ammo types, which, while ammo is generally pretty light, is still more weight you don‚Äôt have to carry. 
---
Consider your perks. On my HW Main, I run Gunsmith and Luck of the Draw to limit my repair needs, because I‚Äôm also not fond of repairing. But I could reallocate those to enhance fusion core durations, give me nerd rage, give my HW cripple chances... there‚Äôs lots of choices, I just made the ones that help the things I care about most. 
---
For the record, on my heavy weapons/explosives/power armor main, I carry around a ton of heavy weapons (and several two hand melee weapons since I‚Äôve built up a perk card set for them too) and ammo, but my Gatling Gun and 50cal get used 90% of the time. I‚Äôm In my combat perks, I‚Äôm sitting at about 700weight of stuff. I can‚Äôt sprint, but don‚Äôt need to. But I‚Äôve got enough weight reduction perks built up that when it‚Äôs time to fast travel, I can swap them in to bring my weight down to 230ish. And being on PC with perk loadout manager I can do that very fast. If that wasn‚Äôt an option, the annoyance of manually swapping perks would probably have me changing what I carry. 
---
Trying to do/use everything at the same time means you‚Äôre not going to be very good at anything all the time. Pick a weapon specialty and master it. Then start experimenting with other builds if you get itchy. My main HW guy has the stat loadout that I can also make a shotgun spec (or, as I‚Äôve already done, almost any melee spec) without any perk movements. When I decided I wanted to try a rifleman, naturally with stealth and also maximizing vats crits, I made another character because the SPECIAL build would be so different. 
---
So on my stealth vats rifleman, I run 1 str and 1 weight reduction perk; I carry excavator armor to equip when I‚Äôve got a heavy load of loot and I want to fast travel, and my guns last multiple days of play, because I focused on massive damage from stealth- most enemies die in one hit. I primarily use 2 lever action rifles, although I do have a sniper rifle, two-shot handmade, Tesla gun, and Gauss rifle with their ammo stored in my stash for things like whitesprings nukes, SBQ fights, or messing around).
---
Agreed 100%. I got on here yesterday and counted *seventeen* goddamn "PVP mode is bad" posts! There needs to be some regulation. 
---
Lure them to a vehicle, jump on top then kamikaze. Or jump up on the ledge to the side where they can't get you and take them out one by one.
---
Do you know what figurative speech is? Metaphors? Or you take everything literally because you never went to school? When someone tells you are full of shit, do you also think they are referring to your birth? :D
---
Hell I'd be okay with just porting over FO4, FO3, and NV just to play co-op. 
---
Completely agree - would be fantastic!
---
Junkies Bowie knife.   smdh
---
Make them twin girls in matching dresses. At the Whitesprings. 
---
All houses or just turret farms?  I build around whitesprings for the open space.
---
You might be onto something...
---
WHERE ARE THE MALE BRAHMIN?!
---
Women are also more likely to report it/remember it. Statistics are strange when it comes to self reporting. 
---
But that goes against the narrative. 
---
I have had bloodied weapons...
---
My TS gauss has 280dmg. Nice, but I'm not shooting something 20 times when I can melee them in 2-3 shots. I have all perks for rifles maxed...
---
Are u guys with good guns able to take out a lvl 80 ish mutant in 2 shots? If so, with what?
---
looks amazing, great looking deco
---
I only get to chose between 50s jazz or classic and by classic i mean its fricking 1600 beethoven up in this nukezone. Where do i get that good radio station?
---
i dont know if im right but pretty sure a full set of sentinal armour makes you damn near invincible when you stop moving.
---
I have 500mbps down and 50mbps up, with max 20ms ping. I get crashes multiple times an hour. Internet connection has nothing to do with it.
---
Thanks :)
---
Yes let's target people when no evidence has been submitted only an accusation. 
---
It's simple really. They spent so much time working on all the detail with it being 16x the detail of any previous game and all the end-game content too. /s
---
Simple answer is that they somehow didn't think to make it expand beyond the width it has for 2 figures. 
---
Heavy armor looks better because it covers most of the body. Medium and light expose skin and underarmor. Plus it has high defense. 
---
Wish I had that many character slots.
---
There is a difference between an opinion and a review.
---
I miss this play style so god damn much. all iv ever wanted is a legit little vanilla wow clone. 
---
#MOUNTAIN GOATS?
---
Let's continue this movement!
---
I usually drop all my surplus plans and recipes in the train station suitcases too
---
How many does anyone normally have? Is he lying then?
---
You're supposed to pretend that this game has those systems.
---
It has the best balance of damage resistance from both physical and energy weapons.
---
Sentinel and assassin are legendary perks
---
assassin reduces damage taken from other players
---
sentinel reduces damage taken while not moving
---
It's great for pvp because of all the resistance from all types of weapons and players.
---
You get them from farming legendary monsters
---
Because they know the community will do it for them and they can use that money saved to sell you a 300 dollar plastic trash bag leather Vault 76 jacket.
---
I can claim wirkshops. I will DC with in a hour if i do.
---
"This protest is getting out of hand!" - Literally no one around.
---
You would think that for an Event which triggers almost every time you go to Grafton, they would have... you know... made sure it actually worked.
---
Things like that are why the Survival Mode concerns me.  When they can't even get dead simple events like Protest March sorted out in three months - seriously, you're just spawning a handful of Scorched, what is the problem here? - what business do they have jumping into a new gameplay mode?
---
Our group consistently fixes the invisible problem by entering and exiting a power armor suit. YMMV.
---
Same with the vault-tec bed - I couldn't figure out what that unlocked
---
I would love to see your review after 100 hours.
---
I understand the power of assassin sentinel, but have no clue about heavy armor which is why it confuses the hell out of me haha. This combat armor must be something REALLY special if they are asking to trade it for some of the best armor in the game.
---
Yeah we tried this that same night but I think the whole site was bugged. Next day we did bravo with no problem. 
---
Why would anyone want heavy armor over sentinel assassin? Are these people just non pvpers and want end game pve stuff?
---
Did that to get the dam robot to stop attacking me. As a bonus i get free legendary kills now. They just stand there while i reprogram them with All Rise.
---
Yeah, it just cant be really close to a wall, otherwise it works as advertised. 
---
love idea it's the year 2102 pretty sure they have flares with beacons in them that can give off a faint signal....
---
I bought a second copy of the game to just dump it all somewhere.
---
Heavy is a type subset of armor. Like Light, Sturdy, Heavy. Combat is a type, like Leather, Marine, Combat, Raider, etc. Sentinel and Assassin are Legendary effects on those armors.
---
I one shot level 68 mutants with my explosive pipe bolt action pistol.
---
Vats builds are no joke.
---
I also know a few merchants buying and holding dozens or hundreds in case the loot pool gets an overhaul down the line.
---
you can get heavy armour that has sentinel assassin legendary perks
---
Heavy armour provides better base resistance stats over sturdy (medium) and light versions of the combat armour
---
also increasing the beam of light using the '' new far view '' technology so people will notice without looking at the map... just give us more ways to interact with others
---
It gives everything except legendary. High luck make having more plan. That‚Äôs why 
---
Yeah it seems bugged, i dont even know why there is a switch.. 
---
you dont. every time you could get a disease, the game rolls a chance to infect. the resistance makes you more likely to win that roll.
---
IIRC the sentinal legendary gives 15% damage reduction when still and the Assasins gives 8% against pvp damage. 
---
So if you're stood still in a full set of sentinal armour you have an additional 75% damage reduction on top of your normal armour rating. If each piece was also "assasins" then you've another 40% against player damage too. You're pretty much untouchable
---
Heavy combat is probably the best, non power, armour out there in terms of balanced resistances, although I'm not sure how it compares to Marine. So it makes sense to get the best perks on the best armour
---
Who makes minimum wage past 20¬ø
---
You on PC? I‚Äôve got a one star furious handmade and a one star stalker‚Äôs handmade that are just hanging out in my stash, if you want them. I think they‚Äôre both level 45.
---
Club house at white springs. Server hopping is the best way. I get 3 or more almost every time.
---
I don't think I've even sniffed a serum recipe yet
---

---
pretty sure it just has the highest dr of the armour. but i could be wrong.
---
My husband and I have been playing since beta as well. We‚Äôve had our share of these ‚Äúgriefing‚Äù encounters. We have also helped plenty of players; weapons, armor, aid, junk, helping in battles, etc. And we have been helped plenty along the way. 
---
I‚Äôd like to think that as long as more of us are helping we are tipping the balance in our favor. For every person we help they hopefully go on to help someone and not grief someone. We obviously can‚Äôt kill the players like the ones you encountered, I doubt it would make a difference, or even deter them-people will be people. 
---
Maybe take a break from going out of your way to help but please don‚Äôt stop helping. Creating an experience that allows people to feel the joy and fun that comes with helpful gameplay is important to offset the anger and frustration that comes with encountering these griefers. 
---
I am level 51 and It is true there are a lot of nice players. I‚Äôm also a solo player usually and it wasn‚Äôt until this game that I actually started making friends and joining parties for quests and events. That being said, I ironically found my first a-hole last night. My party went to the nuke zone in Whitesprings, everyone on the server is fast traveling and meeting up at the golf club. One guy shows up and uses an explosive shotgun to kill EVERYONE. One shot, we each go down one by one. When we respawn we realize even our entire power armor is destroyed so now I‚Äôm hunting for junk to fix mine. As well as looking for that explosive shotgun to use on the next a-hole I come across. 
---
I saw something where the person stored the floor they were on and the turret came back 
---
There is no quitting duct tape.. you just get used to it. Bethesda hear our exaltations of the Sticky Silver Goddess. 
---
Also three words: Duct. Tape. Armor.
---
"only does thing once, in a low level zone"
---
"wonders what he is missing"
---
I don't really see the point in having more than maybe 3 or 4. I have 2. A melee and a rifle/shotgun build. Only reason I would start another is to do an all heavy toon but not til heavy weaponry is viable
---
I've never tried but can't you just hotkey that thing? I usually go to my camp before I log out or don the HS if I feel the server getting wonky due to a triple nuke launch or something.
---
Fallout 4 has the settlements and a shitload more content baked into it. I spent over 1k hours on it.
---
my friend is a cat person. and we always bring him cat meat because it drives him wild. 
---
does anyone know if you cam tame the cats? we have been trying and never able to pacify him.
---
Whever I see this kind of whacky stuff for sale on the atom shop o stop for 5 seconds and say to myself "yep, looks stupid enough to fit in a fallout game"
---
I thought that was patched?
---
I get that but why cant i use them for crafting? Especially since once you pick them up how can i tell or remember which ones are the dirty ones? Also the recipe doesnt say non irradiated sugar bombs. Just Sugar Bombs 4/4... Just a weird quirk and now i need to go hunting for clean boxes only
---
The size of the studio doesn‚Äôt matter. If a publisher wants to push a game out in a specific quarter to make their shareholders happy, they‚Äôll rush an unfinished product. Probably in this case because they wanted to avoid it coming out too close to Rage 2. I feel bad for the devs at Beth game studios who no doubt wanted to spend more time on it and make it better. Publishers are the worst. -from a game dev
---
I think you are mixed up with the fusion core generators at a few of the workbenches. The generator you can build at your camp does not create fusion cores.
---
I've got around 200 hours into the game, there hasn't been a single time a rat biting me didn't give me a disease on the first hit. 
---
People like to embellish the numbers sometimes, but I can say with 100% certainty that 100% of the time I get a disease on the first hit. 
---
I don't doubt what you said is true, I'm just saying that there's probably a bug with it that keeps it from working properly.
---
Heavy Raider and Heavy Metal have better physical resists when fully modded. But Combat has more balanced with energy resists. Leather has the best energy resists.

---
Ahh thank you all. I am beginning to understand why people sought after this armor.
---
excavator armour for general use and t51 with reflective plates for nuke zone.
---
Ditto.   Why the hell cant we bulk screws?  Bulk screw are a thing,  vendors have them.  Why are incapable of putting a bunch of screws in a little plastic bag?   I built a goddamn fusion core and radiation scrubbing arch last night!
---
Demo expert either rifle man or commando tank killer bloody mess and if you want to go extreme like me have a sneak build for X2.5 damage and x3 at night
---
Haha yeah, that jacket looks a little trashy and low quality 
---
14 days later but I had to reply so that you'd know that someone else feels your pain as I too kick myself every day and every time I see someone with them.
---
Ah thanks. I feel like I surely must‚Äôve tried that but I‚Äôm not certain. Let me see if that helps. 
---
But what if you need the money from the sale to afford the fire fighters?
---
All the non auromatic perks under p and the explosive perk under a i think
---
Charleston herald building should be on your list of search locales.  Typewriters and fans there.
---
PSN unfortunately
---
I love it, it's a nice qol thing that means you don't get stuck on 2 inch ledges when the ground isn't flat, that would be so much more annoying given there are basically no flat areas in the entire game to work with. 
---
Yeah I killed about 5-6 legendaries and didn‚Äôt get a drop from them today.
---
That'd be outstanding. I'd be happy if they simply added This Machine tbh. 
---
What's gets me though is they literally used a low level character to basically scout me out. Then came in to just literally wreck me. I guess it bothers so much because of how expensive it was to repair everything and the fact the guy literally admitted to cheating and knew there would be no consequences to for their actions. I'm sure I'll still continue to help people I literally pick up aid I don't need to just to give to people. But in the end I'm just going to be a lot more cautious not as inviting. My base was in the dry lake bed. Large brick house several water purifiers a decongestant shower at the door I put it there with the intention for people to be able to use it. After last night though ive moved to the  very bottom of the map away from everything. I just can't afford to repair everything constantly. 
---
They probably changed it's designation from bug to feature. 
---
I'd ditch it.
---
They catch ppl with huge amounts of items.
---
There was a cry baby post on here where a guy came across 70k worth of guns.
---
He thought it was ok and gave alot of away and traded stuff for dirt cheap.
---
He got banned
---
Karl Pilkington would actually make an odd fit after Travis
---
Yep. And I'd lose my shit for the 5.56 pistol. Hands down my favorite pistol across all games. And of course, Bozaar and Anti-material rifle. 
---
I've chatted with many others within the game. We all had the same complaints and were going to move on quickly. Most people that still play are probably the only ones that are tolerating it.
---
A friend gave me my Handmade TSE. Not sure where she got it from though.
---
to get around the broken keypad doors/garage door i build my own on off switch inside to close it from inside, but half the time i fast travel home the switch glitches out and i cant open the door from the outside doh. I'll take a wall off go inside and the switch has no light, ill toggle it off then on again and its fine every time.
---
It doesn‚Äôt work, tested this with friends. Anyone can walk up and hit the switch
---
Explosive effect is what made guns viable, hopefully the nerf doesnt make it into a melee fest again
---
The game is nothing like fo3
---
That's not enough, your overlooking the complete weapon imbalance of TSE's and sentinel assassins armors.  Once those do drop for a select very few in survival they will be the gods among the plebs and dominate the leaderboards.  Who ever can collect those fast enough will be the leaders, simple as that. 
---
The ONLY way I can see legendaries staying is IF you drop ALL your weapons and armor upon death, that way so those god's once brought down in rare situations (say 10 players teaming up to take down a god player) then someone can grab that stuff and then do the same.  That may 'somewhat' make things more fair, but if your caught solo against a god roll player your dead over and over; that's not fun at all.  It's not skill or strategy, it's LUCK of who got the better RNG god roll.  310 levels in I've still yet to see a single TSE drop or assassins sentinel armor piece, those are absurdely rare, or items drops are seeded and my character name/bethsoft account name or whatever is my seed has dealt me something where I can never get those items by looting.  
---
Beth really has themselves in a pickle with survival mode considering how awfully unbalanced their weapons and armors are for PvP.   They literally can't come out of this without pushing away fans from some side.  
---
I'd vote to completely remove legendary effects and balance from there.  Otherwise your going to end up with a few trolling the many and owning the leader boards and Beth are not taking weapon/armor re-balancing seriously.  Just look at their current solution to nerf two-shot mostly while leaving explosive, they SHOULD have made those effects named items affixes to get only 1 or the other, they can't seem to correctly address anything despite having hundreds of staff on this game, like who is making these really terrible design decisions? 
---
Did they not look to WoW, Eve, Destinies,  FF478, Warframe, etc. for examples on how to balance PvP?  It's like some college kid that never played multi-player games is carrying the lead designer title at bethsoft and making all these terrible PvP design decisions.... 
---
I've clearly played a metric ton of F76, but even I'm starting to get angered.  
---
They have spawned in my game...maybe it's a glitch...
---
I'll keep searching for a good weapon. Appreciate the input.
---
I believe it is actually the unclean ones you need for crafting.
---
Most of your list can be found in the challenges menu
---
Oh definitely. They'd all be very, very welcome additions. 
---
You can always come back to that Silo... Next time use the Silo holo tape so u can see how long till that silo resets
---
highest dmg I seen is 689 and idk how.
---
Explosive Damage perk is under I, not A.
---
You could also take the "Bigger explosive radius" from Perception.
---
Evidence of this?
---
Yup broken also tested this with complete strangers they could still flip the switch without the code
---
I love how ppl say x01 is better in nuke zones when the reality is excavator and x01 both get 2 rads per second in there.
---
I think only raider is crap in nuke zones.
---
Sometimes you to neglect realism for fun and/or game balance.
---
You.... realize that they pair up, right? Heavy combat is the armor itself, sentinel+assassins are the legendary effects ON the armor. 
---
oh god damnit. Thanks. Ill go just hoard everything again.
---
Omg this is the best suggestion I've seen on the sub.
---
MONKEY NEWS!
---
You can use the small conduits that place on the ground, and then place the wall. It'll go neatly through! 
---
I seriously love you
---
Your picture shows that you had disease resistance at that moment, but did you also have it each and every time a rat hit you?
---
I've noticed many hits from diseased enemies not giving me a disease while I'm fed and hydrated, but I also use the perk that increases well fed/hydrated bonus.
---
2 &amp; 4 for me, the greyed out level problem when crafting is a constant restriction to my game, level 30, 40 &amp; 50 is never available, I've never been able to take advantage of my crafting perks or level, have to find items while looting instead, the crafting system seems simply broken.
---
The excavator PA glitch is useful, just don't leave your armor while over encumbered or it resets to default when re-entering.
---
there is a maximum amount of water that can be generated out of a single area, and if you build more purifiers they will not be able to exceed that amount, the benefit you get building more is maximum storage. I vaguely remember the amount being 24 or so per hour, but it may be slightly different. 
---
Yes it's very fun for a short time. The biggest complaint is that there isn't much to do, you just arent at that point yet
---
When cooked they give you agi and end +1, in addition to food/HP. 
---
i've only had one bad experience so far, but it was my own fault. i was in the prison killing mutants and apparently accidentally shot some level 100+ dude by mistake while shooting the mutants, so he killed me.
---
Yeah i thought so, why even adding a switch..  
---
If you ever get stuck with a CAMP you can't place you  might try server hopping until you get a free move due to someone's CAMP being placed already. Depending on the location it can take a little bit of time but it's nice to save the caps. (especially due to the fact that small moved seem to cost more than moving across the map.. smh)
---
Stair hooking is a pain and gets worse when you try and used the 2x1 metal staircases. Randomly your structure will bug and not let you hook to the staircase landing nor will it let you remove the 2x1 so you end up scrapping everything.
---
Overall in the game, if you look at stairs in the world environment, there are plenty of examples where hook points are not forced to the center of a platform or base. Look at the Ranger towers for a good example. Why these hook points are not available in player CAMPs is really frustrating.
---
My 2 cents.. certainly feel your pain.
---
no one has mentioned the bees or the fish yet.
---
This. Chances are very low, but higher/or at least faster to farm than other sources. I went through about 50 maps the other day. I got plans for a t51b limb (to make it) and for some helmet mod for some t-series helmet 
---
Avoid walking into the club house if alone.  Backtrack down the hill behind the club and onto the greens for that initial rush that comes out of a fresh spawn.  If you zig zag and have heals/radaway on standby you can get through it with mediocre gear. 
---
If you are there instead for the quests, then just ignore the club house.  Take care to stealth around the paths and don't charge into the buildings.  It's not too bad at low levels once you know where the spawns are.  
---
The low level guy probably had a Legendary weapon with Exploding Bullets or Two Shot mod. They have overtuned damage, which will be nerfed in next week's patch.
---
If you suddenly start meeting way higher mobs than you did before, it's probably result of a high level player entering the mobs' vicinity without killing them. You could take your chances in switching to a new world, hoping that the mobs didn't spawn for such players.
---
Yep didn‚Äôt know if they was worth the time 
---
Then I shall be hitting up Dabney homestead tonight üëç
---
His social commentary on fallout life would be funny. 
---
" Supermutants were at it again , bangin n that,,, its Six in the morning,, always eating meat, you never see a Supermutant with a dandy boy Apple"
---
Every single week there's a new post here from some guy who's played the game for a few hours and loves it, and doesn't understand why the game got negative reviews. Because apparently playing the game for 3 hours, months after it's been patched and improved, means you know better than all the 'stupid youtubers/media'. How dare they have a different opinion of the game, those idiots! 
---
And of course this sub sends it to the front page, every time. Because people are that desperate for approval. Never change, /r/fo76
---
I was able to get around the crafting thing by traveling to a friends camp and using his bench. Also scrapping and rebuilding the bench seemed to work
---
&gt; Your picture shows that you had disease resistance at that moment, but did you also have it each and every time a rat hit you?
---
Yes, my character is always well fed and hydrated, I rarely drop below 80% hunger/thirst. Thing is, I don't use the perk you mentioned, so maybe that's why I'm always getting diseases?
---
But even so, in this pic I have 50% resistance, and it definitely doesn't feel like it.
---
Ask the person that had that.
---
They could be running chems and bloodied build to inflate the number
---
I say puke. If you hurl and she comes back, she's yours. If you blow chunks and she bolts, then *it* was never meant to be. 
---
If think melee weapons are not useful enough, you don't have the level requirement to post this.
---
When I use to get that bug a lot, what I found that helped is a bit annoying but it worked for me every time. Both you and your party entirely restart the game. Everyone needs to stay at the main menu. The leader then needs to invite everyone via the social menu while still in the main menu. Once everyone has accepted and in the party, then the leader should press play and you all should load into a world, while in a party. I've been playing solo for a while now, so I can't say for 100% it still works. But I know the few times I did that, it worked every time for us. I hope this helps ya.
---
Welp, username checks out.
---
As far as the story is concerned, as you've noticed (and appreciate), there's some nuance involved. You have to actually look for it.
---
Many of the people complainibg about a lack of story simply didn't put any effort into looking for it.
---
Are they active in lore yet? Asking as a genuine question because I don't know
---
See, i do love their single player games. But I knew what this game was supposed to be when I went into it: no NPC's, enjoyment based on exploration and player interaction. I was prepared for that, because I payed attention to what it was supposed to be in 
---
Honestly? It turned out better than I expected. My bar wasn't set ultra high, but it wasn't at turd level either. I'm enjoying the lore this game is setting up, some of it BOMBSHELLS for the fallout universe if you are paying attention. That and random encounters with other players. Comparing loot and shoot stuff together.
---
Now if I could just get my IRL gamer friends to play, it'd be a lot more fun I think. 
---
" i could eat a Knob at night " 
---
why do so many ppl continue to say that it exists in the game and when I say i saw ppl with it on, I don't mean to lie
---
i dont think we need to litigate what a weak point is. im asking which body parts on which enemies., I always aim for the head, even for protectorons
---
my point is don't ask what you are missing when you have only tried something once, in a low level zone at that, instead just rephrase the question, like "are treasure maps worth it?"
---
awesome, ill be on for dailys soon and maybe later tonight.
---
I think many of your ideas are spot on.  
---
I 100% agree that active/passive perks should be a thing... I'd even settle for a hotkey ability to swap out presets to make it feel less tedious.
---
One thing I don't agree with OP about is shotguns.  I don't consider them a long weapon, and they don't play at all like rifles.  I like having the damage perks for shotguns tied to strength.  If melee and ranged damaged get balanced,  playing rifle/shotgun will be a lot more fun than my current cookie cutter rifle/unarmed build.  
---
Might have been 130, but yeah.
---
To OP- was he melee or ranged? Ranged, he could have been a stealth vats sniper, popping crits and headshots constantly. Melee, well, if you build melee right and have supporting gear, melee does insane damage. Basically all the damage perks, and bloodied weapon, and unyielding armor. 
---
If you haven‚Äôt, check out nukesanddragons.com, there‚Äôs a perk planner there so you can see all the perks and build something you like
---
Aye, thought that on my first day tbh.  But that might not happen so I thought this was a good balance.  You usually have more weapons ammo and scrap but the 30-50 of food and water items would help a bit.  Plus, having a fridge would look cool as hell.
---
 My BOS Heavy Combat Armor is about equivalent to my Excavator Armor in stats, minus the Rad Resistance. Now I use perks in Endurance that buff my Combat Armor and not my PA. 
---
You're not understanding the point of this post then. Weapons that have no mods to upgrade it should at least get *something* of an available upgrade. I'm not asking for ten more mods for the super sledge, it already has enough "oomph" when upgraded. But it's pretty crummy to get a 3 star legendary dagger that has great attributes but not enough base power, and you can't make it any better.
---
Like, bad idea or just don't need it?  Just curious is all
---
Yes thats the nice thing but your essentially sacrificing 10 screws every time you craft, springs can be farmed pretty quickly at  mclintock or sugar grove.  you can only pray that rng procs super duper often.  Id prefer to have more than 20 mini nukes for every scorchbeast queen event to make things more exciting.  Thats about 50 screws or less and it might end up being wasted if the queen‚Äôs loot is already learned plans or useless junk lol.  
---
It‚Äôs funny because you can actually find serrated cultist blades despite not being able to modify them yourself
---
Guys, dont forget adrenaline under agility.
---
I'd love to hear a swing band remix of that sound clip! 
---
I have 761 on a handmade. Without magazines or bobble heads. Jus with perks and i dnt use blast radius cause i die more often close enemies get
---
Do missions, events, build a sick CAMP, pvp with people, explore. Do whatever your heart desires.
---
roughly speaking, from the middle of cranberry bog you can hit almost the entire area, so a bit less than the size of cranberry bog on the map, or the ash heap, I may go set up mount blair and do some testing later.
---
Can't tell you how many times I've tried to reach out to a low level player to give things away to, only to find out their level 110
---
Technically nothing is set for lore yet. It's only been 25 years since the bombs. Fallout 1 doesnt happen until the 2160s I believe. And the rest occur after that. So it's very easy for Beth to add in anything they want. Hell FO4 is like just over/under 200 years since the bombs fell. That's 175 years from where our current character is
---
Yeah but they weren‚Äôt asking for that pair which confused me. They were asking for weapon reduction as the legendary ON the armor. I get it now, it‚Äôs just some random armor you could get a legendary effect on. How to find the plans to craft it though is my next question 
---
Thank you, just did that.
---
 Its better than Marine. Just finished selling the last of it. I can make Marine, but not Heavy Combat, so I got mine from Cunningham. The BOS mods give a serious buff to it.
---
Clearly they are going to wait to share and the can't wait to share statement is a lie.
---
That is actually insane, do you have any ironclad/barbarian/evasive benefits adding to that or just flat insane defenses?
---
PA armor pint is only from tech data, you‚Äôll have to pray. Combat armor paint you can get from tech data and I‚Äôve seen harpers ferry sell it on occasion. I picked up my BOS combat leg paint plans there.
---
Only the initiate paint is available currently, you can get it from finding technical data in the world (filing cabnits and desks) and handing it in.
---
The quest auto pops up as soon as you loot the technical data, and you can only do this quest if you have joined the brotherhood on the main questline
---
I server hopped Grafton Station for my BoS Combat armor mods.
---
If you are looking for a particular melee weapon that doesn't have a fixed spawn location, like the power fist, deathclaw gauntlet, or shish kabab, go to abandoned bog town, there are over a dozen random melee weapon spawns throughout the town meaning you are fairly likely to find it there.
---
I know, and I've done it quite a few times. I just didn't know if there was just bad rng or there was another way
---
build?
---
Just beat it thx for anyone who joined
---
Maybe not molerats but ticks have always given me a disease first hit.
---
I'll give that one a look. I heard Phoenix in Watoga was meant to be a good source, but I'm yet to find anything
---
If you get into trading its really fun and soon youll be doing that for a majority if the time
---
Do you think living in a vault is kind of communal in nature. Kinda like the ideal of communism. Pretty ironic if you ask me.
---
  There's full Ironclad and full Fire/Explosive on my build now. My exploder shotty kills me far less now. ;)
---
Ill get on n tell u hang on but i built mine around shotgun n sniper so i use all exp perks and all non auotmatic rifle perks and i have all mods unlocked for the guns i use so i use stronest receivers
---
&gt;.. but I think most of us still playing really want that new content.
---
...most of us still playing...
---
... still playing...
---
because they didn't expect people to play that long
---
We have become the thing we wished to destroy
---
FO76 is definitely what you want it to be. Recommend sticking to main quest line and taking up faction quests as they occur. Don‚Äôt be afraid to engage in higher level creatures for a challenge. Events are fun too. Welcome to Appalachia.
---
I did all the plans in my inventory a little while ago since they'd been building up and I had 30 or so. I got a *lot* of plans, including warehouse, brick and metal building sets. I got a bunch of ammo and aid items too. 
---
LoL and it plays when you're trying to concentrate fighting the Scorch Queen , players will die because they're laughing :)
---
Here is a link to the wiki: https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Gun_Runners
---
The timeline loosely fits, but there is an already established origin. It would need a little creative writing, but could still fit in just fine. 
---
Yeah ive had this issue as well, had disease resistance from well fed (not using the perk) and on the first hit received when i login i get a disease.
---
Once ive cured it though my resistances seem to work again.
---
Yeah I mean seeing 4 of them in 140 levels isnt rare at alll
---
Yeah I was afraid of that. I know where I can get Brotherhood armour, but I just want the paint since I spent so long getting my full heavy legendary combat set
---
I had Starched Genes level 2, I just forgot to switch perks back. When I lost Speed Demon first time. 
---
So any amount of radiation can cause mutation, fair enough, I guess I was unlucky there to catch Herd Mentality.(I had Starched Genes level 2 on) When I have watched The Weirdist on Twitch trying to get mutation, he has always had to go for high rads. 
---
Guess I will have to bite the bullet and use Radaway and cure mutations, with loss of 2 that I brought.
---
Thanks for advice.
---
I‚Äôve found three in the past two days
---
I agree with OP's sentiment, but also agree with you that this post is virtue signalling. Like, if this thread was a woman who experienced harassment telling her story and asking other women to do the same or something like that I'd be totally in favor. But when it's some dude saying "I'll take it from here ladies... GUYS, WE NEED TO CONTROL OURSELVES!!!" I get the cringies all over my body. 
---
I love it, well done! My very favourite thing about it (besides the brick, which is gorgeous) is that it's *not" a ridiculous floating monstrosity. 
---
I tend to use Glowing Blood pack, Glowing Fungus Soup and Radshield in high rad areas.
---
Thanks for reply.
---
Haha no idea. I think the only Heavy plans I‚Äôve found were for leather. 
---
If you build beyond 2 floors/levels you won‚Äôt even be able to remove those floor pieces...  have to reset/move the camp and start over.
---
I have over 50 treasure maps I have no idea how to use them lol 
---
Lately I fast travel to an event, it starts &amp; then almost immediately marks as failed. Pretty frustrating when they are already scarce.
---
Vaccinated 3 (END), which lowers your chances to catch a disease by 90% and Rejuvenated 2 (END), which buffs the Well effects work really well together.
---
I assume Well effects increase your disease resistance rating by 25% and not lower your chances to catch a disease by 25%. 
---
 You get BOS crap from the RR car west of Waqtoga Station. I have I believe 3 kinds BOS underarmor. ;)
---
 Careful, an Assultron watches that car. 
---
plans in different zones provide different quality items, forest maps are generally low level common stuff. However higher tier areas provide better stuff. Ash heap maps are particularly useful as they provide excavator power armor mods and plans for said mods, which can be very "difficult" to get. Other zones provide power armor plans similar to the vendors for said location, raider/t-51 in the savage divide, t-60 in cranberry bog, ect. A note is that later zones have much larger loot pools, able to provide the same absolute garbage as earlier zones as well as late.
---
maps weigh nothing, so there is no real reason to get rid of them, unless you are on xbox and want to give them to me for free. I would say don't go out of your way to hunt them down unless you have a lot of them though. Do be sure to wait for the dig animation to finish before trying to claim multiples of the same map, it can bug out your game to spam too fast.
---
Can‚Äôt wait till I open my restaurant in fo76

It should.

Find the dirt pile and dig. 
---
It's much easier with a guide, otherwise the dirt piles are pretty difficult to find. You might know the general area from the map but the exact locations are sometimes obscured by grass or whatever. 
---
Yea, ive just seen people trade unyielding or assassins sentinel or calvalier but never vanguard
---
Same. I‚Äôve only reached level 3, but I can‚Äôt find any problems with the game. People need to stop echoing you tubers. This game is like perfection

Only had joy at Grafton.

Appreciate that insight! I will teak my build to take into account those few perks. :) Ty
---
They are fixing that issue in next patch.
---
You obviously have never ran through a Diablo 3 season before. 
---
Fissure\*
---
You could yeah.
---
Only level 3, I don't get all teh hate?
---
It's just how the game does it.

Definitely going to check it out. Just hope rng is on my side

I am pretty sure there are recipes for the serums, I just have not found them as yet.

Buying from Vendors is the only market I know of. (If people wish to play "market" they can, nuff said)

You hit the nail on the head here. 
---
My female friend has a group of like 10 guys that trip hand over foot to give her shit. She got a prime receiver for her gat and asked them for violet flux for ammo, ended up making like 12k ammo.
---
She hasn't had any negative experiences yet, but when guys try to mess with her she just calls them out. It's not like they can *actually* intimidate you anonymously over the internet, as far as she is concerned.
---
I think the giant shoulder pads detract from the look. 
---
Those floating camps are an eyesore.
---
The higher the charisma the better. I have like 31 charisma because of unyielding set and I can sell for a little less than half the price

Ive started keeping track of what each vendor has, out of 25 server hops heres what phoenix has had:
---
1 t45 core assem.    
---
6 t45 motion assist.    
---
1 t45 emergency protocols.    
---
8 t51 motion assists.    
---
1 t51 kinetic servo.     
---
1 t51 tesla bracer.     
---
3 t60 motion assist.    
---
1 t60 kinetic dynamo.    
---
1 t60 hydraulic bracer.

Game turned out to be mostly what I expected, no idea why some people expected it to be a single player rpg with friends by the looks of launch.
---
They delivered a game in a shitty state, but they delivered a game with all they said they would. 
---
Depends on what you define as griefing I guess
---
idk why they would have a value number that has no affect...
---
Pharma pharma is a good perk to get early game if you know exploring the main quest
---
Love wearing the ritual mask and the priest outfit. They just work almost as good as the sentry bot helmet and the enclave uniform.
---
lol where do all these salty people come from? please tell me what any other triple A game does for allowing players to earn the pay currency enough that I don't even need to buy it. Also I don't think when they did play testing in development people probably weren't in the hundreds of levels and only realized it upon release. It takes about 200+ hours to get passed level 100. I doubt the developers auto leveled their chars to check if it fit. It will be fixed. They have other things to worry about that. Also don't act like you are a engineer that designs game functions and mechanics. You have no idea how easy or hard it would be to change that. Your comment demonstrates how little thought you put into what you say.
---
I assume killing his is griefing. Probably.
---
He has calibrated shocks for t51b I‚Äôve gotten them once from him outa 100 and something hops
---
I think it's either the price you get when you buy the item, or the price the game thinks you should trade it for.
---
This is a very good idea. I will definitely implement it. Thanks!

So raiders should drop stimpacks and food for other players?

Most people seem to agree Grenadier doesn't affect explosive weapons.

kinda too much for just a flare but... i like it lets just hope bethesda is reading...
---
As long as you and your teammates use PA with good rad resistance or an undamaged hazmat suit, then I think you only need Rad Sponge rank 1. I mean, I also use Radshield but I don't think it's needed to have a steady-state of 0 rads.
---
That's the plan. Thanks!
---
It works perfectly fine for me, I'm using them at the top of my stairs to block the gaps on either side. 
---
I don't notice this. My buddy has the game on the OG xbox and it does not run very well.
---
I‚Äôd say not needed. Are you storing food for a nuclear apocalypse?
---
I haven't gotten any TSE so far but found 4 explosives. Damage with Demolition Expert 5 and 3x1 Heavy Gunner/3x1 Rifleman/3x1 Shotgunner
---
\- Assassin's **50 Cal** w/ 50 DR while reloading (Nuked Whitesprings): 110 dmg = 5-8 shot into the chest of a lvl 68 super mutant
---
\- Assassin's **Tesla Rifle** w/ VATS something (Thunder Mountain NPP): 99 dmg = 4-6 shots
---
\- Hunter's **Lever Action Rifle** /w 15% faster VATS critical (Highway North of Thunder Mountain): 410 dmg = 2-3 shots 
---
\- Ghoul slayer's **Pump Action Shotgun** /w 15% faster VATS critical (Hunterswille North Gate): 530 dmg = 1 shot
---
I found one TS LMG and one TS Pistol in my \~500 hours, both terrible to use. I'd much prefer *Quad*, *Vampiric*, *Instigating* or *Anti-armor* prefixes instead.
---
The shotgun does far more effective damage as the extra explosive damage gets applied to each 8 pellet it seems. However, I still have to shoot a lvl 91 Deathclaw 2-3 times with it.
---
I have and they are terrible.
---
Have you ever played fallout before?  Or did you somehow just conveniently forget about Raiders?

Monster: Makes squeaky noises

The durability goes up a lot with the right combination of perks; I get about 6 cores (more than 100% full cause I make them) before mine breaks. Weapon Artisan repairs it up to 200% condition, Gunsmith makes it break more slowly, and Luck Of The Draw makes it randomly repair while using.
---
It's completely ludicrous that this isn't explained *anywhere,* to the point that there's like 5 different theories about camp/workshop water generation.
---
Ludicrous.
---
I've noticed two types of invisible teammate issues.  The first and most common is the one where you can see their name/level indicator but not their character (it can also manifest as their character being naked).  This one is very easily resolved by that character removing and re-equipping an outfit.
---
The other type is the one where you can't see anything - no character model, no name/level icon, nothing, but you can still see them on the map.  This happens when the character loads from one area into another, and your game client sees the other character's model in the location they were in previously, stuck in one position and nude.  That is the only place you will ever see their character, even if they're not there any more.  Only resolution I've found for this one is for either of you to disconnect and reconnect.

They spawn in several locations in the forest as well as in the dry lake bed by Lakeside Cabins.

Hmm. Seems to work for me, but perhaps I'm mistaken. Fair enough,
---
There's cat meat .. so there's that

Good one :)

Its not broken, its a feature!

I roll play as a bowling ball that rolls over things

I have a PS4 Pro. Like when you get up close to fight ghouls you don‚Äôt have them clipping everywhere. Getting stuck. Standing still and never moving. Glitching across. Get some input lag sometimes when shooting. Stuttering a lot. Like once of twice a fight usually 
---
Luckily I got those from trading with someone
---
Its ridiculous how common some plans are. ultralight marine chest was there 14/25 hops (counting twice if he had two copies). At watoga station, he had it 17/25 times.
---
By domestic they mean placed by a player.
---
This is known and they have not had a update to be able to fix it yet. I am not sure if Patch 5 will include energy weapons. I agree with you. The right perk cards can help but their inherent durability needs to be increased for sure.
---
You do, which is why dupers were duping and drinking them to get lots of caps. 
---
I'm on console and haven't experienced it either. PC master race always thinking they are better than everyone. Says a lot about PC demographics, I think.
---
For fucks sake am I tired of reading this thread.

it's for sure one of the best one handers till you find a good 3 star
---
Disease resist is based off of your endurance and disease resistant perks, it‚Äôs a percent chance to get infected from creatures. I have resisted a diseased mirelurk before with 5 endurance, so it is possible to not catch a disease. The same applies to toxic gas in the ash heap and toxic/ dirty water.
---
One of my most memorable experiences was randomly teamibg up with a few others who invited me. Back then we all were still using voice chat. One of them was hardcore role playing by narrating our adventures as we explored Appalachia. Good times.
---
Nukes &amp; Dragons site is awesome, thanks so much for your work on it!

349 with the revolver with only 6 of the 9 gunslinger perks, and 482 with the lever action rifle, all rifleman perks used.

Haha I love KP. I'd be too busy dancing to shoot.

That is why EQ was so fucking awesome.

4) I'm definitely in a minority here, but I use my mouse left-handed.  I've always reversed the buttons, so my right-click is a normal left-click.  In all previous Fallout games I can play without issue, other than having to use the "wrong" mouse button on menus.  VATS in Fallout 76 requires clicking to shoot, but is also hard-coded somewhere that a normal right-click exits VATS.  I can bring up VATS, but neither mouse button will actually shoot, and just ends up exiting VATS.  I switched the mouse controls back to normal just to confirm it works as normal and isn't some other bug, and it worked fine that way.  
---
Is it possible to get it fixed so that when I re-bind controls, that actually is reflected everywhere?
---
Belly wiggle.
---
Jelly jiggle.
---
Up that butt.
---
There's a pickle.
---
What about water? Us players need to *STAY HYDRATED*
---
Let's agree to disagree. Although I don't play like that and it also pisses me off sometimes, it is a part of the game and was designed with that particular behavior in mind. 
---
one x runs good i just wish they could do something about that long delay when you load in and the delay when you go to bring up the map 
---
Most definitely, if they did what they did with ESO, it would be great
---
 If you apply the BOS mods to Combat Armor its part of it.
---
i also wanted to make an analogy how adding PVP servers and letting existing character in is like a hoarder with a house full of junk and cats adding a room addition for the cats then just filling it with all the junk anyways. 
---
&gt;I can agree with the fact Bethesda should have fixed most of the bugs and glitches
---
Well shit man if you're going to offhandedly forgive them for things you acknowledge are unacceptable then of course you're going to have a different opinion than people that don't...
---
No I don't believe I did. I will try that, thank you
---
mistaken sorry man. placebo affect haha. It does not affect explosive weapons. 
---
This is so bothersome. 
---
Just wait a while. With a bunch of people all carrying a ton of loot it seems to sometimes lag to high heaven - even showing empty.
---
If you wait until after the quest rewards go in and press R to open the corpse up you‚Äôll likely see your loot.
---
I know, I just can't find them to begin with. I can only paint the helmet
---
That's great. Side question, what did you use to build the site?
---
Its a shame that your unconfirmed anecdotal evidence of an outlier in statistical probability doesnt mean squat
---
Role playing and raider life!!
---
The exploration aspect and experiencing content via visual storytelling, holotapes, notes, and terminals is actually very reminiscent of Fallout 3.
---
I haven't actually paid attention as I wrote that number off as irrelevant, but I'd wager it's the price you have to pay to buy it from a vendor.
---
I have extra X-01 jetpack mod 5k caps. PS4: RIVA5150
---
don't lie. I am sure it was high but I doubt that high without chems or bobbleheads.
---
It doesn't look like you could equip it to me. It looks like a unique death setup with something shoved in the skulls mouth.
---
With Unyielding you can get damage up a lot with strength or boost any stat really for whatever reason. Assassin for PvP damage reduction. These are both very useful. Vanguard not so much. Though Troubleshooter is awesome for silos. I have a full set though mismatched and not the best, but would like to get it in full Heavy Combat armor or something. That would be cool.

Gotta get plastic for my shotgun shells somewhere! 
---
There's also the crazy cat lady house north of Bolton Green, and Whitesprings has a bunch scattered around. 
---
Camden park is not bad, and Tyler County Fairgrounds has some (much less). 
---
Yeeeah, i dont think we will get it. Making FO76 into one more battle-royale sandbox is way easier than delivering new PVE content. The latter costs money.
---
'Looking for Group' under the party tab on your xbox is a gooder place to post
---
AP regen stacking would be insane for any VATS build, not just snipers. Adrenaline - Gun Fu minigun would be so much fun.
---
Reminds me of a note in the fallout cookbook that radgulls are a good substitute to chicken because they are so rare.
---
The point is if they disliked it, they wouldn't still be playing it. No one spends their free time willingly doing something which every time they're done with a session they think to themselves "Jeez I hated that."
---
I ***love*** the game and I've got a laundry list of complaints. Just because someone complains about issues doesn't mean they dislike the game.
---
It's not off as in not working. Since Charisma affects the prices, Hard Bargain cannot reduce or increase the prices significantly. I think it's worth it.
---
seriously i would rather just have a longer load screen than be standing there vulnerable for like a minute before i can do anything
---
Really? I must be in gaming hell then, being level 350.
---
I just collect growing fungus and make a bunch of soup. Helps a lot due to me having speed demon.
---
Hey, if the cost to benefit ratio works out then so be it.
---
It‚Äôs a shame you‚Äôre upset somebody wants weapons to be balanced against each other and your lousy luck won‚Äôt give you a handmade. Calm yourself kiddo you‚Äôre acting 15
---
Nope, gotta die by another player directly
---
Head like a fucking orange! I had him as a follower in fallout 4.
---
What is *OUTCASTS*?
---
Damn I bet you feel kinda dumb now huh?
---
Yeah its extremely annoying and depending on where you log in at, it can get you killed
---
So, you pretended to be a girl so guys would continue to hit on you? Are you trying to tell us something? Maybe you should have a chat with your SO. 
---
I can craft handmades, and have an explosive double handmade
---
Afaik, there is no minimum level to trigger the event. I did it around level 15.
---
muHHH immesion
---
Then explain what are raiders? They're assholes that wanna steal, bully, and kill, just like griefers
---
Since the mixer asset and various nuka colas are already in game I suspect this is to be released at some point. Probably with it's own quest to get the mixer machine and the various recipes to be found in the wild. I hope so anyway
---
Then what‚Äôs the problem?
---
I role play a good Raider. I know a rare breed.
---
Turrets are pretty much useless and take up an enormous amount of budget. That's probably where at the excess has gone. 
---
I don't think anyone has been able to confirm that budget increases with level, could be a popular rumour. 
---
My new character is only level 12, and I've got a fully decorated 2 story house with a workshop and farm. No turrets. 
---
Having an issue on ps4 where I can't join my friends team. He sends me an invite but it won't notify me same when I send him one. He's sent another friend of ours an invite and he was able to accept it. But I can't. Please help. 
---
It‚Äôs better then spending hours or days sever hoping trying to get one. 
---
r/whiteknighting
---
&gt; This is exactly what I wanted from Bethesda
---
I've been saying since Oblivion that going with fully voiced NPC dialog causes an exponential decline in content because of all the added cost and time involved with recording and re-recording voiced dialog; and that I wish they'd go back to a mostly text-based experience *a la* Morrowind.
---
So this is also exactly what I've wanted from Bethesda. I don't necessarily want TES VI or even FO 5 to be unvoiced, but I'm *entirely* okay with it in 76.
---
"Superior"
---
In lore the armors are designed for different tasks.
---
The excavator is build as a civilian mining tool, and is inferior for combat to other PA, but it's still a giant steel suit designed to protect against falling rocks and stuff, so it's the weakest combat armor, but has awesome utility.
---
T-45 was simple, producible, and relatively cheap, it was designed to stop bullets, and so has good ballistic dr, but is lacking overall because it was never designed to fight energy weapons, that were rare when it went into service.
---
t-51 was built for combat, to take the worst the Chinese could throw at it at any cost, it's expensive, high maintenance, and it stands up to anything on the battlefield.
---
t-60 was more a post war design, and though excellent overall was designed to be more economic than t-51, being easier to build and maintain, using more common materials, and sacrificing some of the excessive combat ability because the big danger was over and it didn't need it anymore.
---
Xo-1 was built to take on the post war wastes, with maximum survivability against the new threats posed by radiation and environmental threats.
---
raider is a bunch of cobbled together scrap, build to be better than nothing, and is as cheap and dirty as it gets.
---
I like it better this way than fo4's better in every way every step of the way system
---
Vendors are basically pawn shops. They loaned 120 bucks for my switch a few weeks ago.
---
60% bonus damage is insane when you don't have it.
---
You tell me. You're obviously all worked up about an opinion on Reddit. 
---
Lol I know was waiting for coffee at time was anxious pouring didn't want to spill it on my phone....
---
A third you say? I've purposefully tried twice.. And nothing spawned.. so.. next time I'm doing it! 
---
I hope your math checks out. Haha 
---
What's you damage with it?
---
Yeah I‚Äôm sure people reading your replies would agree with that lol
---
It is, i got 5 alts
---
No, we just want to share food, and water, and ammo etc. But the big meanies don't want to share.
---
A group of the BoS in Fallout 3 that separated from the main group.
---
Probably true, BoS jumpsuit is a special rare drop from events and dailies.
---
No amount of anything is going to reduce weight in reality besides less of something.
---
What exactly is your point?
---
Thanks for enlightening me.
---
I always kind of thought T60 was a straight upgrade from T51 for the most part, same with XO-1.
---
Good to know more details.
---
OH, OKAY. COOL. HAVE FUN, **Bartholomew**!
---
Damn. Thanks for the answer tho
---
Always drinking for extra strength, this would be awesome.
---
Im sure they would. Im not the one that just couldnt wait to call someone 'kiddo'. 
---
That bug was fixed, they're correctly named now. I never found them until level 97, from a treasure map. 
---
Well mainly gathering resources i think. But i may attract ppl for pvp aswell
---
O... kay...
---
They shouldn't mess with Interplays lore anymore. It would just stir more controversy.
---
Literal garbage comment. Melee is way too overpowered. No gun can ever compete, or at least counter, with ANY melee weapon now.
---
No gun is as powerful as TSE. They‚Äôre supposed to be end-game things to grind for, to keep farming legendaries for.
---
But no, you and your whining ruined the game for us and a lot of other people like myself are leaving the game permanently after this.
---
All the keypad is doing is turning the switch on and off (I do the same with a terminal) 
---
To get around people walking up and activating the switch I put mine higher up on the side of my house.
---
What rank do you have luck of the draw at? I read in this subreddit that rank 3 has no real difference as opposed to rank 1.
---
Desert Eagle, 45 colt ... hell ANY 45 caliber handgun/pistol and a few others are incredibly deadly. Aim is key with pistols as is distance. 
---
Then again ... pistols are great in this game if you use'em right. I use auto pistols/pistols and 1 auto rifle. The job gets done and quickly, clearing a room with a pistol and vats is super easy, lol.
---
runs like dog turd on my wife og xbox one
---
Casually trolling someone acting childish and rude is not a problem lol
---
it's useless unless they disable legendaries completely. survival will be doa otherwise because a)there are other exploits and b)someone will eventually roll godly legendaries and proceed to make everyone else miserable.
---
A real human bean.
---
I imply I'll attack their base until they move it or I kill their turrets. 
---
A house is a house. A turret farm is just another enemy to me.
---
Someone is salty
---
The PSN year in review thing tells you how many hours you've spent. I'm at 201
---
r/incel
---
lol hope it makes your exploration more enjoyable. I play on PC.
---
I love the game, not sure why it gets all the hate. It's also the first time I can play a Fallout with a friend, which is pretty sweet to me
---
It would be nicer if you showed what clue(s) the player could get from the maps and deduce from them.  For instance, on Forest Map 1, the clue is the broken bridge, since there aren't many broken bridges in the game.   On Savage Divide map 1, if you can make out the spike objects on the drawing, you should have no trouble remembering where they are.  On Savage Divide map 8 (the one with the motorcycle), if you can figure out the what the distant dome object is, it should be easy.  Some of these landmarks are already drawn on the game map, so that is another way to help you find these locations.  The toughest map, I think, is Forest Map 3, since the direction given on the map is actually WRONG: it should be N instead of W.
---
Which legendary did you equip the MIRV modification onto? 
---
Just don't let legendary effects on weapons or armor work in survival mode at all. That is the only thing people fed up with importing characters is duped TSE and all that stuff. 
---
The tame and/or pacify option DOES NOT APPEAR if you sre using a scope.  Must be using sights.
---
The work with Last Laugh. I keep a couple on me for anyone how tries to grab my junk after they kill me. 
---
I Completely agree with you. 
---
I saw the Skyrim mod for him.. It cracked me up when he said something like " you'll be needing a carrier bag for all that stuff you got " 
---
They're just too greedy, I understand completely 
---
This would have been great when I was low level and pinned down in a trailer from the grafton monster lol
---
What's not great about them? Free fast travel, passive ammo and junk, items, plans, the odd person who wants to try to take it from you and becomes a big investor in the workshop cap production, etc.
---
Yeah its long sorting through your stuff all the time. Wait till you gather some missiles and nukes 
---
I did the same thing next to Site Alpha, but with foxes. They were great company!
---
No I would like to get some 
---
Anything involving not giving these snowflakes what they want is considered griefing apparently 
---
Oh, I completely agree. I just really want the 1k+ max AP and several hundred AP regen while I hold down a minigun trigger. I wouldn't mind the several hours of farming for that 2 minutes of horde removing goodness.
---
Take workshop
---
Gather materials
---
Bulk them
---
Sell them 
---
tada
---
I've enjoyed the friendly atmosphere of the game so far, but last night my friend and I took over an owned workshop and fought with the owner for a good hour. He kept coming at us and we noticed his camp was near the workshop so we dropped an orbital strike on it.
---
It was hilarious fun. He finally disconnected, and I understand being frustrated, but it's part of the game.
---
Sure, he'll need to drop some mats to rebuild things, but he was level 80 something and by that time in the game it's not like it's hard to get the mats. There's also not much else to do, so I wouldn't be surprised to see more interactions like this until new content is released. 
---
Ps4 pro - runs really well, crashes a ton when in T60 PA with targeting HUD mod 
---
Ooh Chimpanzee that MONKEY NEWS YOU FUCK!
---
That part was chilling for sure...
---
Remember, you can change the intensity of markings and tattoos in the character customizer.
---
What a asinine thing to say.
---
"Literal garbage comment. Melee is way too overpowered."
---
Also simmer down.
---
TSE is not suppose to be the end game meta no matter how much YOU wish it to be nor I wish it not to be. It's already getting nerfed anyway because guess what. Even the developers agree, weird huh?
---
You're the one whining. Saying something needs to be nerfed just because your feelings got hurt over the nerf happening to TSE now.
---
And, bye. If that ruins the game for you, thats sad. I can get by without a legendary weapon and here you are, whining about TSE being nerfed and how melee needs nerfing cuase no guns holds up to it.
---
I can clear a room before a melee can even get to it. When they can do that, talk to me again. Till then go back and think about the asinine things you've said.
---
Carrier bag? Just use a tie 
---
It‚Äôs is the post apocalypse bro, that‚Äôs the way it is.  ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I managed to get it before i had xo1 torso plan from enclave unlocked so it couldnt be done
---
I'd like a "wait a minute" and "laughing" emote. 
---
You do.
---
And you're lever 20 or what? you can't see certain event until you reach certain level. show me map for lvl 50 character
---
Who knows...I haven't heard of anyone managing to do that but anything's possible.
---
&gt;role playing
---
Sometimes, at the top of a hill, I lay down and flip over. 
---
‚ÄòCause that‚Äôs how I roll. 
---
The value it shows when you inspect that item? That‚Äôs the base value without calculating for charisma and a cut for the vendor not paying full price etc
---
 I'm on PC
---
If my alt cannot find them this is what I would do.    Thanks Proxima.
---
I have 3. My main, and 2 alts that I use to play together with 2 different friends respectively. my friends dont play as often and I feel bad if I was just running around as lvl 100+ with a lvl 15. So i keep 2 alts at their lvl to get the "full experience" =)
---
I get that and I‚Äôve played that way as a group before as well.  My issue is that it makes the gameplay less fun.  I run a VATS rifle build and most of the gameplay involves VATS headshot at medium range for 1HKO.  Figuring out what‚Äôs been tagged, particularly in chaotic areas like white springs golf club just isn‚Äôt very fun.  I can do it, but I‚Äôd rather not have the hassle.
---
I just don‚Äôt think you lose much at all adding exp and loot sharing in groups, and you gain a lot in terms of increased incentives for grouping, which is what FO76 should really be about.
---
I think I got mine from taking over workshops. If you're on xb1, I have one you can have.
---
What controversy? How have they messed with lore? Serious questions
---
 Its about 123 after upgrading it to level 45. I still have perks to buff it. 
---
 I would like to know how much the stock sword ignores armor as I have 2 points in AP to 50% and I don't know if I need the third.
---
Yeah I've got a lvl 5 toon waiting for a friend who may or may not come back
---
I thought this was just because of my crappy old tv. Wew.
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed under Rule 5 and your post has been removed.
---
I have a two shot gatling.  It does a base of 144.  
---
With heavy gunner perks it's up to 223.
---
I also have stabilized, so I ignore a lot of armour, and One Gun Army, so I stun and cripple most enemies that last past 3 shots.
---
The base damage can be enhanced greatly with what you add in.  
---
Would it be nice to do 400+?  Sure, but the game is easy enough for me as is!!  The real challenge is finding the mats to upgrade my PA and finding plans for armour paints!
---
I like to fire them from my cliff-side villa at night...
---
It was hell for the first week. its a bit better now, but I still don't think its a \*\*\*GREAT\*\*\* game.
---
Omg! I am! Just name the price üòÉ
---
Yes! That's what I'm talking about! I don't know what all they could do, but I just remember seeing the signs everywhere and wondering why this isn't a thing
---
Free lol! Add JetNukaGirl76, I'll be on it about 10 minutes
---
Unicorn giddyupbuttercup!
---
I logged into the same world with my level 101, and the only extra I had was 1 Enclave  event (Bots on Parade). 
---
LOL. I have 3 myself.
---
Thanks! Nuxt.js
---
I don‚Äôt care about the fact I can clear a room before a melee can.
---
I support a small nerf, maybe reducing the explosive radius and making it not apply with Demo Expert.
---
But the fact they made them COMPLETELY irrelevant and obsolete compared to a fully-modded and fully perked All Rise makes me pissed off.
---
Ps4 og.
---
Runs fine.
---
I got a unique network setup so my problems are very low
---
Dyaamn....Does he need some rad away fro those burns?
---
My camp is a glue factory. Help. (Tato, Mutfruit, Corn, and Purified Water.) 
---
If an event is ready it should just show on the map. I shouldn't have to fast travel to a place that starts the event on the chance that its ready to start. Patrol duty for example. There is no way to tell if its ready to start till you walk to the entrance.
---
I predict the small handful who still play this game to reduce significantly next patch. I think BGS gave up on this. All we have to look forward to is a beta testing of some shitty pvp mode in March. Yikes.
---
Do I .. do I actually have to answer that?
---
I think it would be better as a homing beacon station, where players actually have to home in on him.
---
Ya that works for me ü§ù add me when you get a chance: TheGrandDuke
---
The world building is top notch! Appalachia is one of my favourites. However, sometimes the amazing world does feel a bit empty. I get that the Scorched claimed everyone, but it would be nice if coming to an amazing location also brought an interesting quest like in the older games. 
---
Make a cycle through Watoga Phoenix, Watoga Train Station and Harper's Ferry.  These cycle PA mods, sometimes 2 at a time.  Don't see what you want?  Server hop and repeat. 
---
The detail and stories shown aren't that bad at all, which is to be expected. 
---
The issues we're complaining about stem from repeated server crashes, poor weapon balance, total lack of end game content, etc
---
The game is DEFINITELY fun and don't let any sour asses ruin that for you
---
I look forward to your indie game, and it may be better than 76. Get coding.
---
Just put all your junk in the stash box first then run up to someone and they will probably kill you
---
You just lose the Junk that you have on you though it's not really a big deal.
---
Typical destiny fan boy. Anyone who has anything negative to say about your beloved game is salty. Enjoy your garbage game.
---
Nearly 300 hours and I'm still loving the game. I didn't care about reviews or youtubers because I make my own decisions unlike many people who will only play the games that youtubers tell them to play.
---
My only complaint about the workshops is spending 25 caps on a workshop only to get disconnected. This has happened so many times after I have powered up Poseidon, claimed the workshop and right as I am about to get my hands on some sweet sweet fusion cores it hits me. DISCONNECTED FROM SERVER. 
---
This makes little to no sense.
---
Wait the Raiders are communists? 
---
Yeah no... 3 months work for nothing once the season is over? I‚Äôll pass....
---
T51 is my go to for nuke zones. I pop like 1 radx and 1 radaway the entire fight. 
---
Plus i live in anchorage so.. kinda my thang
---
If you think any PVP, base attacks or workshop theft is griefing
---
You should be euthanized 
---
Yes it does. With level 1 perk a gatling laser has 650 rounds, with level 2 it has 800 and level 3 ups that to 1000.
---
Oh let have two sets of text on the same screen at once. Better option is to just have a zoom in feature.
---
You get a bunch of raider armor mods by the top of the world raider camp.
---
thank you so much!
---
Dude i have over 500 hours and have gotten one sentinel piece and youre trying to say you legit got a whole set. Okay bud
---
5 caps. Take it or leave it
---
Like outside of the white springs bunker, when you're not in power armor and its a hot zone from a nuke.
---
I cant read any of the notes. It's too dark and small. 
---
Not true at all, the stats provided here are trash mostly. 
---
Killing legendaries, iirc, helps too. But if you‚Äôre having trouble and you want some easy kills on scorchbeasts, in the south east corner near one of the fissures, is a spot with automatic rocket launchers. Load up on oil, gears, steel, and stimpaks and go there, repair the SAMs, and get the scorchbeasts attention, just get a couple hits on the beast yourself and the SAMs will take care of the rest. You just need to keep repairing them
---
As far as I know only the light impacts your sneaking
---
That's the one where you have to get commendations right? I believe other things you could do to get then is to do Enclave Events (though should pop up like regular events on the map, just hover over the yellow icon for an event and and it should say 'Enclave Event: (Event title) ) or even killing legendary enemies of I'm not mistaken.
---
Is that the enclave quest to access nukes? if so you should have enclave events spawning on the map to do to earn commendations too.
---
Sentinel = unyielding?
---
Supply and demand.
---
The bots don't want our garbage
---
Luck has absolutely zero effect. 
---
I was playing with this guy a week ago who was telling me I wasn't getting high quality lengedary drops because my luck wasn't high enough.
---
But when I asked him for his list of legendary weapons his  his high- luck stats had gotten him, it turns out that his list of legendary weapons was identical to mine. 
---
That's what I thought.
---
The game does look good but I'm not gonna buy anything from ea.
---
Yes, when you loot someones bag, leave a little communist propaganda leaflet behind for them.
---
Although a sudden ‚ÄúWOULDN‚ÄôT IT BE NICE‚Äù would almost certainly get your ass blown off
---
No. They do not exist canonically at this time.
---
Call me what you like. I'm still going to smash your CAMP. ü§£üòÇüòà
---
What perks are you running?
---
nah, "I belive" they are out there, lol
---
Pilko Pump pants + 100 carry weight and you can sit comfortably on any rock for a rested bonus :)
---
Yeah it's the turrets. Level doesn't increase build budget. I have the same camp I had 150 levels ago and no more free budget than then.
---
This has been a common complaint. Especially with the pip boy no longer pausing the game.
---
Pistols are extremely deadly to unarmored targets. We have to assume combat armor is effective against small arms fire or why would it exist. Metal armor being made of seemingly multiple welded pieces of steel would be pretty effective as well. Speed kills, and pistol cartridges just aren‚Äôt that fast with a couple of exceptions, they‚Äôre not that great at penetrating armor. 
---
IMO attacking someone‚Äôs base is griefing‚Äîespecially if they put a lot of time into it. 
---
The ‚Äúraiders‚Äù and griefers are people that have no self-esteem in the real world and thus bully in the virtual world.  
---
I sent you a friend request.
---
The biggest issue ive ran into lately is logging and some quests (that are not daily quests) disappear...log out and in again and they are back. 
---
*gets popcorn and sorts by controversial*
---
Btw if you get bored of the cynicism and want to be among people that just love the game, there's a 'casual' sub full of peeps like that.
---
 Thanks. Its not the same but that sledge info is very useful. Its a Medium Weapon and with the fast swing perks hits a lot often more than a sledge.
---
Yeah im still talking about this guy having a full set of sentinels. When did I say unyielding hard to get? Cuz its not and low health builds are fucking lame anyways
---
Zooming in wouldnt make a difference
---
I have 2 now. Put the rest in the stash. I rarely if ever get the wrong one. I choose the 2nd on the list, and I can't remember the last time it wasn't Excavator.
---
Well hours is definitely in there unless you‚Äôve all been playing for 7600 hours. 
---
Wanted players killed is a challenge as well, can tell you how many up to 76 players when you complete
---
But I guess it‚Äôs not true at all
---
&gt;IMO attacking someone‚Äôs base is griefing‚Äîespecially if they put a lot of time into it.
---
Why? It's an intended mechanic in the game. What makes it griefing?
---
Just add subtitles like bioshock used to when you wanted to read things on the wall
---
people need to stop asking for new modes. Jesus. How badly do the duped items affect you? Not at all.. Especially if you play on a normal server. Also dividing the community into even more server types is a terrible idea IMO.
---
I leave some salt usually
---
Here‚Äôs the things the games lets players do:
---
Kill stuff
---
Find stuff
---
Build stuff
---
Kill each other
---
Steal stuff
---
Destroy stuff
---
Which part of the game are you upset with specifically? Because there are reliable, easy ways to avoid those parts if you take the time to learn how. If you don‚Äôt know how to avoid being flagged for PvP, block someone, or want tips on how to protect your base I‚Äôm happy to help. 
---
Look.
---
I do understanding having your favorite type of weapon nerfed. I've played many a mmo I've have to re roll entire classes due to weapon nerfs.
---
The problem here is people tend to ignore a lot of the good weapons  there are.
---
10mm, 308 rifle, combat rifle, black powder pistol/blunderbuss, smg, .50 cal .. there are a bunch more. My personal build is auto pistols, non legendary at that {due to not finding any good ones, lol}. I have zero trouble either, save for when I *cough* run out of ammo &gt;.&gt;.
---
Play style is also a key factor. If you want to run, gun and decimate without thinking. M79 works nice minus it's 1 ammo chamber, lol. But to be honest without a few other weapons, not effects getting buffed thats a bit hard sadly, though stealth can make up for that.
---
Though to be fair, they could stand to buff the fatman and missile launcher for more viable explosive builds.
---
yeah cause it's ROLE-playing....
---
You can bulk screws gears and springs.  
---
Bulking of more so you can sell it rather than store it. most of what you can bulk doesnt sell unless it is bulked. screws for example can be sold bulked or not, while bone shards cannot be sold unless you bulk them and gold can be sold and not bulked.
---
It is intentional infliction of emotional distress.   It is intended to cause grief.   
---
I am not talking about cheap portable camps (like I use) but the more elaborate ones that folks spend days getting just right.  
---
Fair critique.
---
I found them in cranberry bog in the railway cart just up the line from watoga station
---
I dropped a bag with some food, water and a propaganda pamphlet to a guys who‚Äôs GT was a take on ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt tread on me‚Äù and he literally followed me around for like an hour trying to get me to PvP. Good times.
---
Look at this one, acting like the communists would have anything worth looting...
---
...oh, look! A frag grenade.
---
If zooming in doesn't help you identify the shape of a letter you're looking at, bad news I have for you bud
---
Water purifiers of the same type/size don't stack on production. Adding more just adds to the amount that can be stored before they are all full. 
---
People have joints between their armor! Let us vats that then!
---
Though honestly with the lack of head armor in this game. All domes are exposed for bullet fire doom!.. save for power armor users. &gt;:(
---
On the tracks?
---
I like the Excavator Power Armor. It has a good beefy industrial look, the carry weight and mining bonuses are nice, and it fits in with my character's backstory.
---
i've never heard anyone who plays this way complain. most complaints i've seen are from people that were lvl 100 inside a week. it's not without its problems, for sure, but i've been enjoying it the same way you have. The respec system is THE FUCKING DUMBEST THING I'VE EVER SEEN, like criminally dumb. yeah.
---
Yes! I have t45, t51, excavator, x01, and limited fusion cores. They‚Äôre consistently breaking down and I have personal attachments to all of them so I can‚Äôt get rid of them. I‚Äôm placing and collecting power armor ALL THE TIME. 
---
Are you considering any mutations? That might influence card selection as well.
---
I found them but can't remember where exactly. It was in a tent somewhere around Cranberry Bog. Probably somewhere in the North East part of the region. Hope that's enough clues for a treasure hunt. Sorry I couldn't be more specific.
---
 In the car on the crate. Watch out for the Asultron.
---
&gt; It is intentional infliction of emotional distress
---
... If you get emotional distress from intended, unexploited facets of a video game, then maybe you shouldn't be playing video games
---
Just because it's an intended mechanic it doesn't make it good. You gain nothing from destroying someone's base other than the dubious satisfaction of feeling powerful.
---
Correct. The production does not stack. You are just adding storage capacity so you don't have to empty them as often. 
---
1400. I think the reset is 20 hours, I've definitely done it in less than 20.
---
Believe it was 1400 without wandering vendors
---
If I was a child I'd have shat myself to this news. I need to work that into my build now! Thank you for the information.
---
1400.
---
responders, raiders, whitesprings, unique, free states, brotherhood, enclave. 200 each.
---
About 1,400, although you'll spend around 50 to 100 by fast traveling. 
---
Absolutely, so many changes I'd like to see
---
No, they definitely do affect everyone on the server.  Not being able to compete in PvP ruins capturing workshops.  If you want to play with those people, no one is stopping you.  Maybe you are one of those people?
---
inside the railcart on a wooden box to the west of watoga station
---
Ya, you're replying to my comment.....which isn't registering in your head for some reason. 
---
Basically üëåü§£
---
In my pip boy the dirty ones look more dirty, and the clean ones look clean and also overexposed in a weird monotone sort of way. 
---
Yes! And different powered door wall styles
---
Amazing there is no definitive answer, so many perks in this game are still a complete mystery.
---
Sure thing! I only have space for level 1, but it's still a noticeable difference. 
---
Get a group of people it's not just plinking its a song of some sort. Just hard to hear it with just one instrument. The bar called the pickaxe I think has a music truck out there get 8 friends and see what happens.
---
I didn't say there aren't valid complaints about the game. I said that most people who really dislike it haven't played it. The evidence comes from comments like "only idiots would buy this game" and "you couldn't pay me to play this turd", which are the common response on media sites. 
---
The people who play the game will often have criticisms, and some people who have played the game will dislike it. But the majority of people who ~really~ dislike it-- maybe I should have written hate it-- do so from afar. ;)
---
i played to &lt;lvl50 using ranged ballistic weapons. after the respec system (GAG) came out I realized i might as well start over, which I did, as melee. the differences are STARK, let me tell you. At lvl 30 I can fight multiple mobs twice my level. I had real problems with mobs my own level before
---
Scammers?
---
It worked! Thank you! Can‚Äôt believe I didn‚Äôt try that. 
---
If there is a skeleton in the car I found it, I might have to do some server hopping 
---
Or just server disconnect 3 minutes after getting all the resource extractors up. I've given up entirely on workshops until they add a "rejoin last server" option, which is a shame because workshops are the ONLY reliable way to farm certain mats. Looking at you, acid.....
---
&gt;Just because it's an intended mechanic it doesn't make it good
---
I didn't call it good
---
&gt;You gain nothing from destroying someone's base 
---
I didn't say you gained anything from destroying someone's base
---
Literally unplayable. 
---
We can take animals?!?!
---
I enjoy the gameplay but there are serious disconnect issues when i play. I can't get more than 20-30 minutes without it disconnecting from the server. If they ever fix that, I'll happily start again. 
---
Negative 
---
Did they fix Gatling plasmas to actually hit anything yet? Had one and it wouldn't do any damage if the target was to far or to close it has a weird collision detection or something.
---
yeah thats the one
---
I don‚Äôt build camps and I don‚Äôt carry rare junk, so it doesn‚Äôt impact me.  
---
But if you are suggesting that people shouldn‚Äôt have emotional responses to video games then why are you playing?
---
you can report them through the blizzard website.
---
Okay thank you 
---
the more appropriate name for dupers and exploiters.
---
This happens a lot for us if any of us had teamed up with someone without restarting the game.   We now always restart between team ups and if needed one stays behind so we can keep a server and they will restart after the others join back 
---
Uranium Fever and Leader of the pack events.  3 legendaries each.  You will get your commendations quickly.
---
Stairs need to be like fo4. It really hinders my builds. 
---
it really does feel like they're forcing you into power armor, doesn't it?
---
no problem, the marine wetsuit plans and the wetsuit helmet plans also spawn there as well
---
The lack of head armor is awful lol. It basically makes adamantiun skeleton a must take
---
I see some people posting it‚Äôs fixed. Some still glitched. Not working for me still 
---
Comrade?
---
All the raiders are dead before you leave the vault.  There is no justification for becoming a raider.  So if you choose that, you‚Äôre just justifying being an asshole, as the post states.
---
Yeah I had to clear some Parasites after taking a Disease Cure. The toilet was a bit gross so the bowl seemed like the best solution. Sorry OP.
---
I have a crafter build / heavy weapons power armor / medic build
---
got to say most fun I'm having is the medic as hes using pistols and only playing him when friends are one 
---
got a medic pistol and the aoe stimpacks ability so I shoot things crit (team heals from medic pistol) repeat 
---
Its weird that the developer room got so many videos made about it but a video of this trade exploit is so rare that no one has seen it.
---
That‚Äôs nice I loved that from fallout 4
---
The value in the pipboy is private sale and not trade in value 
---
Thank you, thank you, thank you! I've been waiting for something like this to show up. The style is fantastic as well!
---
That‚Äôs like punching a random person in the face and just saying ‚Äúoh well, that‚Äôs part of life!‚Äù
---
Nobody‚Äôs buying it.  You‚Äôre just being a prick.
---
I like the ultracites look but it has no paint jobs which makes me sad. I also like my dumptruck armor (Excavator).
---
Then they should dress up as raiders when they grief other players, and not wear their X01 when they do it. Lol.  That would be role-playing.
---
OG XBox One here.  Runs fine. Load times are a little longer that my wife's One X.
---
Congrats man!
---
I actually enjoy it. They give me a reason to stomp people who deserve it without feeling bad.
---
TLDR: Finally saved enough money to buy a TSE shotgun from duper /s
---
Jokes aside, congrats bro! 
---
Yea I'm actually not tryna hide it at all lol.I like being an asshole to people.The faces they make after I oneshot 'em with my TSE Dragon even if we're not in combat at the end of a dungeon and thet lose their junk are HILARIOUS.Also you mispelled "role" in the title.That is mildly infuriating fsr.
---
Somebody set up us the nuke.
---
Because when it happened people didn't know it happened or how it happened. They fixed it in a recent patch I think. Would be kinda strange if they fixed something that didn't exist.
---
I've added an edit in reply. 
---
Thanks. I‚Äôve given up. Hopefully it will be fixed for all soon.
---
&gt;But if you are suggesting that people shouldn‚Äôt have emotional responses to video games then why are you playing?
---
I'm not sure what you're saying here, can you rephrase?
---
You done whining?
---
Regular ps4. Runs great. Rare blue screens and server disconnects.
---
Ur a noob.
---
Because you get nothing out of it.  There‚Äôs zero reason to destroy a camp except to be an asshole.
---
You‚Äôre perfectly illustrating the premise of this thread: desperately trying to justify being an asshole.
---
Great tool!
---
Could a tab be made that orders the best foods and drinks by (total?) hunger and thirst percentage? I'd like to know what foods are best for me to craft based on what is the most substantial 
---
 Yup 2x7 is 14. ;)
---
Post like this make me wanna hunt down people's bases and destroy them, just cause.
---
This is stupid...if you wanna play where you never do pvp,cool, if you wanna hunt people do want and steal their shit, cool.
---
Personally I scan the map everyone often and look for those with bounties, if none, then I go contest workshops.  Generally if I kill someone out in the world,if they don't start being a twit I guard their doggie bag and make sure they get their stuff back, minus anything I might be short on of course...
---
Your way is not any more right and wrong than anyone else's...and to think so is as pompous and self-centered as you could get
---
Haha hell yeah man!
---
So anything other than X01 is acceptable because I've seen high level raiders wear any kind of power armor in FO4.
---
This is the appropriate response to 95% of the whining and complaining i see people doing. Have all of the complainers ever watched a single post apocalyptic movie? 
---
I have never duped any item nor bought any duped item to my knowledge and I have no problem in pvp. Yes I die sometimes, but if you know what you are doing you can beat them.
---
That's awesome
---
But why? All you do is waste time and ammo? Why not take workshops instead?
---
... Op says doing X isn't part of the game
---
When clearly X is part of the game
---
Op is the asshole here
---
Because every decision in a Fallout game, intended mechanics and moral choices, have been...good?
---
Choosing to side with the super mutants ends with Vault 13 raided by them. Good?
---
No. Being able to raid player bases and demolish is, admittedly, a poor choice. It's one I don't make. But if someone wants to play as a Raider, run around, and kill and destroy people's bases, I see value in that. Consider it prep for faction play 
---
You were defending it.
---
Defending what?
---
Thank you! If you are talking about the mark at the neck, I think that's just weird lighting. 
---
Im replying to you defending duper/ ebay to win boy. Nobodys talkin about shitty ass unyielding glad you wasted time on that. I bet you also have a bloodied one handed melee that does 3k damage too. 
---
Just because I don't agree with you, you assume I am a cheater? lol shows what kind of person you are. I never even get attacked at fricking workshops I can readily go to different servers and cap all of them no problem. If someone comes and wants to fight I look forward to it. I don't even carry bobbleheads or magazine. Also its the one shot club because of the way TSE weapons function right now. I do not need any bobble heads or magazines for my TSE pump shotgun that I found MYSELF at lvl 96 after 200 hours of gameplay. I got my first one. It does over 700 dmg per pellet with demolition and shotgun dmg card. It one shots everything besides the queen and lvl 85 SB's. Its not players fault that they are so strong its pointless to use anything else unless you are just trying to have fun. I HATE duping and cheating. I think it ruins games but I also don't think its such a rampant problem. I guarantee you have never fought someone for over a hour. (if you did its because you were having fun) to be able to use multiple bobble heads or magazines. Most players I see are low level and the high levels I do see are usually quite nice and share what they have. You are just being salty.
---
Well Minecraft patch notes mentioned the removal of Herobrine for like a year's worth of patch notes. So who knows.
---
No? So raiders die and others can take their place. Do you not realize that is the exact same logic as we are instructed to do with rebuilding America?
---
Last night I had my workshop taken, and a stranger next to me too. I was pissed. Not because they took the workshop, I was so ready to fight something more challenging than the AI. I was pissed because all that it consisted of was getting one-shotted by some head ass who went around taking every single workshop in the server.
---
Capitalism, my dear. Just don't sell your legendary super sledge by accident. Then you gotta pay 300(c) to get it back ü§£
---
It isn't real, but there were shenanigans.
---
Being able to view someone else's inventory and queue trades _before they accepted the trade_ was patched. That's the only trade related bug that was real.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/agugsb/psa_trade_weirdness_explained/
---
I think its the t60 set. If i remember correctly thats the same set that was on the old fallout main menus / game art. For me, that particular helmet just says 'Fallout' to me.
---
Yeah was fixed in previous patch 
---
&gt;**Trade**: Fixed an issue where players could view another player‚Äôs inventory before they can respond to a trade invite.  
---
&gt;**Trade**: We no longer let trades occur before the requested player has consented to trade.

---
You poor thing, who hurt you? 
---
So you like being a raider. What a hero.
---
Who said raiders had to wear specific gear? That's just what bethesda designed them to wear, if it's up to the player then they can wear whatever they want. Raider is a lifestyle, not a fashion style 
---
I think if you pull-up on someone's base kill them destroy there base and move on. You could argue RP but if your sticking around for there respawn just to kill them again and again. That's greifing. 
---
Maybe. But I think it was the last patch notes that didn't specify and frankly I don't see any reason select ones should spawn corea but the one you can build doesn't...
---
I don't notice this. I think a lot of the lag issues are server side. This game has the same problems on peoples super PC's (jittering and delays on maps and things like that)
---
 The game mechanics justify being an asshole. Also blow up a camp get a big bounty then get hunted down by bigger meaner ass holes. Take comfort in that friend.  There's always a bigger fish to eat the one you're currently annoyed with. 
---
if I'm not mistaken, bulked items for the most part weigh the same as they did unbulked, with the exception of a few, not sure which ones, is it not for selling to vendors rather than weight reduction?
---
Keep preaching! So true.
---
They doesn't exist yet.
---
Do not build your camp next to the Charleston Train Station or on the Whitesprings Golf Course.
---
You can't beat what I'm talking about. 
---
Maybe you haven't encountered what I'm talking about, and that's good for you.  But if you play around in workshops long enough, you will.
---
There was a bug that was patched that was completely unrelated to any stealing of items. Don't try to build a rumor on an unrelated bug. :P
---
yeah totally I got a really fast connection so it does help I think I also live close to the servers. if they made some sort of offline mode(not saying they will or even asking for it) I think the game wouldn't lag at all.
---
You'll shit yourself with Colonel Gutsys then :-)
---
Major Gutsys are fine, just have good offensive. The real balance should be on scorched conquerers. Even at level 62 they only drop shotguns and maybe ammo. 
---
I'd say griefing and raidering are different. 
---
Griefers are just assholes who wont leave you alone, or will try to goad you into attacking them so their teammate can kill you in one shot/swing. Etc.
---
When im raidering I show up, do some damage, maybe pvp a bit, and eventually move on or hang out with the victim.
---
I need an anti-griefer squad.
---
The wastes of all fallout games are no places for softies; adapt... or play Minecraft 
---
it's moot unless they disable legendaries in the pvp servers completely. either people will bring them from adventure, dupe them in survival or simply find them. once that happens, survival will be unplayable.
---
TSEs are just the tip of the iceberg.
---
That‚Äôs one of like 3 things you can do in the game, getting people to not do it would only continue to make the experience worse
---
Maybe?
---
Depends on what happened.
---
If you were trading gear and they took off with your gear then you're sol.
---
but the gameplay loops are very MMO
---
Might be what I meant, whatever the top tier one is
---
Yeah it is. But luckily our bullets are made out of adamantium. *nods*
---
Your best bet to report anything is to open a ticket with Bethesda and if you have a pix or video add that to it.
---
From what I've experienced Tarberry juice (tarberries that can be found in the marsh/watery trenches are by far the best (of the simplest recipes at least with it just needing boiled water+tarberry) short-term AP regen food/drink to craft. Though that's not saying much since there seems to be little competition in that department.
---
Or just use existing towns from all zones and convert them into HUBs.
---
**HUBs**
---
* Each HUB will be a fortified settlement that have security bots similar to Whitesprings, only fewer.
---
* These HUBs will have purchasable pre-made post war homes, and trading posts and unique vendors, which both are linked to all HUBs
---
* Hubs will have an event called Invasions:
---
   * Stage 1 -- Invasion: \[Name of Event\] - Enemies corresponding to their zone will attack the HUBs in total of 5 waves. The objective is to minimalize the amount of damage caused by the enemies. A meter will be displayed to view current progress. Failing to protect the HUB will fail the event and will automatically trigger the optional stage after killing the remaining enemies.
---
   * Stage 2 -- Invasion: \[Name of Event\] - The last wave is triggered after completing wave 5. Not only spawn more trash mobs, but a unique named boss will summon.
---
   * Optional Stage: Aftermath - Players will have to repair their HUBs to end the event. This stage will only be triggered if the damage meter is past 50% after finishing the 2nd stage. Failing any wave in the first stage will automatically trigger this stage.
---
   * Completing the event by defeating the boss will reward players with zone based items, recipes and plans.
---
**How Homes Will Work**
---
* You must have the level requirement and sufficient caps to purchase a home.
---
* Depending on the location and size of the home will determine the price.
---
* Homes will be instanced, allowing you to access your home in any server without having to worry about losing it. 
---
* You can Furnish your home using a budget unique to the HUBs that allows you to store and access stored items at any other home you wish to swap for.
---
* Budget will be depended on the size of the home.
---
* You may only have one home at a time.
---
* You can fast travel to a HUB once a home is purchased within it.
---
* You can access your own home, others' by navigating through a prompted window, similar to disarming the random bomb encounter.
---
   * The list will be sorted by, first, your home, followed by your group members (Yellow) and then everyone else (White) on the server alphabetically.
---
   * You can setup your home to be public or private, which determines whether or not you show up on the list.
---
Ah, well that would explain it. Thanks. FWIW, while the purifiers say something like 24 an hour, I never seem to get more than like 5 or 8 total. I think this might be a combination of the overall water limit, like you said, and a bug. 
---
It was a bug that some people knew how to exploit to get people to accidentally trade items that they didn't intend to trade. Definitely not unrelated, when it was the source of it.
---
Rollerblade playing.
---
If you notice someone running the silo with you block them from the session and then go to the other silo. First I've heard of people doing it but I'm not surprised. 
---
Ir right i did lie. My bad i was not lookin at my char i was lookin at my lever action not my handmade my highest is like 371
---
Yeah i die alot too,  enemies that run towards you are annoying.  When they get too close i just fly up high and shoot them from above using the jetpack
---
Yeah .. only if you wanna protect that sweet, sweet brain nectar ...
---
&gt;.&gt;
---
&lt;.&lt;
---
I mean .. uh.. yer head. ^^^.^
---
Get an instigating sledge or similar, one shots them....
---
I always drop my extra stuff in suitcases, cash registers, etc. I don't need it and I know there's folks out there who can use it. The community aspect of this game has been great so far. 
---
the one in the shop is clean.
---
I agree with you. People used to be cool on this game. When I was a low level. Now Im lvl 80 there are raiders everywhere. This games changed. 
---
In the beginning game was sold and advertised as PvP-fallout. Now they are selling us again PvP-fallout. They are spending 3-4 months to get out same game like now and it will be also beta, but with different PvP-restrictions settings. How many developers they have left for developing FO76 nowadays? 1-2 summer trainees?
---
it is fixed
---
Jet pack helps man. If anything is near you for the blast radius you take damage too.
---
I saw one without the mask and only the gas mask it looks cool
---
I agree with most of everything you said however, I believe if they did start over and remove TSE weapons from the roll it would be an excellent opportunity to flesh out cheaters.
---
Build your camp close by. 
---
I think Raider is both a lifestyle AND a fashion choice.
---
&gt; I believe it is actually the unclean ones you need for crafting. (Which makes no fuckin sense)
---
It makes sense in a backwards: "Hmm, why should these non-radiated items craft into this radiated food recipe? Better just make it craft from the radiated ones and bang out the next thing on the crunch time to-do list."
---
Why not both? Survival &amp; fresh survival added simultaneously
---
Holy shit, I hit a hornets nest with this one. Look at all of the jerks explaining why they aren't jerks. A-freaking-mazing!
---
A lot of the negative press was from around release, where the game was plagued with issues and compounded by the fact it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot a traditional Fallout game‚Äù.  
---
Now that the bugs have been ironed out the early game experience is pleasant. Take your time and enjoy the scenery and lore presented to you and you‚Äôll definitely find enjoyment.  
---
    
---
However, you‚Äôre eventually going to run into the problems that a lot of community currently has with it; the late game. The story doesn‚Äôt have a satisfying ‚Äúclose‚Äù, and there‚Äôs only one end game boss to speak of and her farming and loot pools are questionable and frustrating.
---
Hell yes! I hustle through the wasteland only with the classical station on my Pip-Boy!!! Never listen to something like that in private but it matches sooo good to the postapocalyptic atmosphere üëåüèª
---
Absolutely reasonable  üëç
---
I havent really used vats tbh, is it worth it? I guess it would help me if i decided to do some shotgunning sometime?
---
It's unrelated to the rumor that someone could steal your equipped weapon and that bug wasn't the only source of accidental trades.
---
It's misinformation. If you want more information on how you could trade queue (now patched) I put a link in a reply to OP.
---
It's just flat out misinformation to say "Yeah, no one knew how to steal weapons, but it was real because it was patched" -- that's not true.
---
I never had that before..

oooo interesting! - didnt see it in my build section but will check again!

Put fireproof 3 on and dense on your body armor and no more worrying about claiming a Darwin award
---
Umm dunno if this helps you or not but some of the atom paint jobs keep an atom sign next to the pa so you can at least partially distinguish them.
---
I keep 3 now no point in the others after you level. There's no way to display them.
---
My 3 are ultracite, x01, t60.
---
They implemented Super Mutants and the BOS in Fallout 76. Yes, it is canon and yes, there is an explanation for it, but you can't deny that people were pissed nonetheless.
---
Not related to stealing things from someone's inventory.

This brought back so many feels. When I got my explosive shotgun I actually screamed. My boyfriend thought I hurt myself and came running üòÇü§≠ 
---
Congrats on your new addition!! 
---
Too late...  :)  But what I was thinking of us those that like to use the buffs from food at certain times maybe?  For me personally, I get tired of hunting for disease cure items, I'd like to keep some fresh.
---
That's not true.  Final fantasy 14 is cross platform 
---
CQB: melee build &gt; other builds
---
Any other range: (Stealth) Rifle build &gt; other builds
---
Yeah, 76 is a good game that suffered from a staggering number of bugs. Why it's received more hate than No Man's Sky and Mass Effect: Andromeda combined is a real mystery to me.
---
I was confused by this post because if you haven't played past games or read the notes and terminals about some of the shit that raiders have done is beyond griefing. Least you have the option to bounce servers, it's not like very server in his game is full of grievers.
---
Omg yes this whole idea is too perfect 
---
I agree, that's kinda what I was getting at. Balance in general is terrible, people are able to min/max and make plenty of weapons into 1-shot machines before we even get to legendaries.  
---
Simply disabling them, however, isn't really a solution. People are still going to want to do some PvE in survival mode, but locking half your arsenal when switching between the two game modes would really disincentivize doing so. 
---
Had a few issues. But really nothing that I have not encountered in many other games. In fact my initial game play went smoother than fo4.
---
I've always found the clown suit and hat at Freddy's house if terror .. it's located in the very north east of the map above the mire
---
It's not the exact same. If you scroll across in the preview pictures, you'll see it's clean and does not have damaged legs. 
---
Hey Alex. Your site has been really helpful in planning out my builds. 
---
It seems as of yesterday all of my bookmarked builds have been wiped and your site no longer works for me on mobile. 
---
Just wanted to give you a heads up. 
---
Enclave events and starred legendaries. 
---
Lots of cash grab items in the shop but there just "clean" versions.
---
Omg yes!
---
Even if you can only afford an hour a day (including through the entire of the Christmas break); this game came out nearly three months ago. That‚Äôs 90hrs minimum.  
---
Easily enough to have hit the end game and be frustrated at the lack of content.
---
Sorry, it's called "feed the person" now
---
If you can share rank 3 white Knight it's make it worth it

You play computer games because they make you happy.   So why would you be surprised that someone could similarly have a negative emotional response to things which happen in a computer game?

Just imagine this. In Real Life PvP, it doesnt matter if you're 8 years old or 75.... a bullet will kill you all the same.

---
Make it a workshop not a camp item. 
---
I'm not being salty, I'm just recounting an experience with an obvious exploiter.  I don't assume you cheat, I just don't know why you would defend them otherwise.  My suggestion literally has no effect on you so I'm not sure why you are white knighting this hard.  Unlike the remaining duped shit that still plagues the game.
---
Your blanket statements discounting what I've experienced over the couple hundred hours I've played this game myself is just insulting, and frankly, a lazy attempt at an ad hominem argument.  You have no idea what my experience with pvp is and attacking my credibility by saying I don't pvp for hours is just a poor attempt at trolling.
---
More like a friend who will claim it before anyone else gets the chance to. This is why bounty systems hardly ever work in games. People will always find ways around it. I don't know how it works in this game exactly, but if it doesn't take the whole bounty from the player, and give the person who claims it half, then they won't be losing anything. If it costs them half of their caps to do it, then at least they are losing something. Or even the bounty loses double, and the person who claims it gets the normal amount. Then even though it can still be exploited it still costs them to wreck CAMPs.
---
I think at the end of the day, it just depends on what you feel like.  The game is not hard and you dont really need to wear the max power armor for whatever you are doing.  It's that simple dont over complicate it.
---
Are you on PC?
---
Griefing is using a overpowered TSE and spawn camping, or following people around trying to initiate PvP with slap. Taking your workshop is an intended feature and part of the game, as well as PvP and breaking into your camp. No one ever reported raiders in the previous games, if they bothered you, you just killed em.  Each to their own I guess.
---
and you only need rank 3 of animal friend and 3 charisma to do it thats all i have
---
I didn't say anything about being surprised
---
Can you tell me where I can find this picture, please. 
---
sorry, forgot he platform, i‚Äôm on xbox 
---
This would further split the community, and I've had more than a few experiences of logging in to a server with only a handful of players.
---
I'm sorry, but no. This is one of the first games where greifers actually make sense in-universe. It's the end of the world; you're going to have people who are only interested in watching what's left burn to the ground. 
---
Just take all our items and plans away 
---
Just killed the queen, I got [drum roll]....
---
A 1* nocturnal pole hook.
---
What good deed did I do to deserve this god roll of a weapon. No RNGesus, this is too much, please take it back.
---
Even though the games lets you pick up more than 1 technical data you can only ever "really" carry one for the mission at a time.
---
Well dang.
---
Wait when did they add survival mode?
---
OK, but then you don't get to return to PvE mode with it, character should be restricted to Survival mode.

---
It's only for abuse, exploitation, harassment, or other inappropriate behaviour. 
---
Nah you're just trying to twist it all to make it sound as if it never happened, when it did happen. The OP never mentioned anything about an equipped weapon. That is disinformation.
---
A lot of the more recent raiding is because players are running out of stuff to do. The sooner we get new content, the better 
---
Played for 2 hours and disconnected only a few times, but so far, such a great game!
---
As many as you need big hoss
---
Best way I've found if you have to kill scorch beasts is to use one of the bos camps with 2 Sam turrets repair them and shoot the sb once and just hide from the stupid spam sonic boom.
---
Sam turrets are cheap as f to repair. Just watch for mobs on the ground the bum rush the sams.
---
poor people problems
---
Case in point: Rose has piercings and tattoos and shit. 
---
Thanks man. I can see that now but I‚Äôm looking at it right now and it doesn‚Äôt even look completely pristine though. With all other dirty / clean versions of outfits the clean is generally undamaged in entirety. This clown suit is still dirty actually, it‚Äôs just missing VERY minor rips on the torso and legs. It‚Äôs practically the same texture...
---
But again, I am just curious as to how many players purchased this already without knowing the clown suit is in game? And Bethesda passes it off as a ‚Äúdifferent item‚Äù lmao let‚Äôs be realistic, how many players are actually willing to pay money for this considering they virtually look the same. 
---
I have 7 in total: the raiders, T45, T51b, T60, exvavators,  ultracite and X01. I just  take all of them from my stash, deploy   them one by one until i deploy the one i need.  You take all the ones u dont need and place them back in your stash box 
---
It's the samething as eso. Sure there were some flaws with the game when it launched but half the reviews for that game at launch was "this game keeps breaking my immersion with all these other players running around." Its an mmo have you never played an mmo before? They barely touched on how the combat or anything else in the game functioned. 
---
We need a game first
---
Can you post some links to your bookmarked builds here? 
---
Also, what phone/browser do you use and what exactly doesn't work?
---
Why it has failed ? ROFL .. Still playing it and still loving it but keep the trolling coming .. maybe I will when it actually does fail.
---
Then they nerf it.
---
Sure but maybe give the crossbow users a little love too. 
---
Was it fun using XP exploits?
---
Bethesda has recently opened a thread on their official forum asking people for feedback on Events. I suggest you post [there](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/314209/feedback-requested-events) as well.
---
It might not be clean, but it's brighter and the legs aren't torn
---
But what are the rewards for this quest? I've done it like 10 times and gives me only combat armor pieces?
---
This quest doesn't give you the BoS paint for the t-60?
---
Funny how some people are so invested in claiming it didn't happen. As if they have some personal stake in it. When some people actually experienced it first hand.
---
this is spam and adds nothing of value to the sub.
---
sorry, but these posts are as regular as clockwork.
---
Sooo cool
---
Tse**
---
It is a coming feature, outlined in the latest "Inside the Vault".
---
Yeah, game was promoted as "no human NPC multilayer experience where you can launch nukes and pvp" unless i am forgetting something they delivered just that. 
---
Oooo allofthem 
---
Why are people playing this game?
---
Beautiful design!
---
Next stop drugs
---
Someone get OP a Kleenex please
---
It doesn't matter how much time is spent building up a CAMP, you don't have to redesign it. Simply hit repair which is MUCH cheaper than starting over. And yes I know that it's annoying to lose resources when you rebuild, but I have honestly spent more resources repairing from Mole Rats that stay out of turret site than I ever have from players. (I HATE MOLERATS!!!)
---
Yeah I can help you out  gt O918 (o is the letter)
---
Oh this will be fun
---
It‚Äôs silly to think that if a raider got a hold of x01 she/he WOULDN‚ÄôT use it.  Let‚Äôs be serious here. Raiding is not Baden any regard, people are just soft. 
---
House building you're forgetting they talked a lot about how they made changes to the build system and that everybody could have their own personal base. But again they delivered on that.
---
This is very helpful. Thanks a lot!
---
Hop off that burner my guy 
---
events in cranberry bog
---
 [AWOL Armaments](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Event:_AWOL_Armaments)  is the best one, it spawns a 3 star legendary gutsy at the end of the event, and it can reward a legendary item as well
---
Also it can spawn in a train car at the railyard east of watoga. There's a group of random enemies there with a high probability of one being legendary.
---
I want them to fix duping and ban exploiters. Maybe take away ANY highly stacked items like Bheads from accounts. This will fix the fact that many dupers have already "laundered" their duped items to clean accounts. Only then will this game mode be fair. Let people keep their TSEs, bloodied sets. Their mutation riddled bodies can stay. This would be fair
---
I don't see how a forced reroll would flush out cheaters. Cheaters gonna cheat. If they can't get their TSE weapons they'll just find something new to exploit. It'd be much better for the game's health if Bethesda go after the root, and fix the exploits that enable the cheaters in the first place.  
---
Regardless, removing TSE weapons isn't even something that Bethesda has offered up, nor should they as the damage is already done. They should try to fix them to make the variants less OP, which they appear to be trying to do.
---
I prefer to be polite and slightly menacing in my raids. I will introduce myself, explain why I'm there, make a demand, and see where it goes.  Last night, my crew and I stole a workshop from a couple of 20 somethings. An hour later, they return with 8 other people to run us out of town. 
---
If people are Raiders, assemble a Militia. 
---
A Colonel is a higher rank than Major though, that would be a silly thing for Bethesda to have done if true....

I use safari on my iPhone. Site worked fine until yesterday. When I tried to pull up my build it gave me a blank build planner. 
---
The whole build planning page seems to be completely unresponsive. 
---
-I can't select cards.
---
-I can't adjust special points.
---
Thanks for the quick response. I hope it gets sorted out because your site is my go to perk planner. 
---
True, i spend a lot of time to try and pimp out my base a little more, always nice when some visitor compliments it, or encountering a nice base made by someone else. 
---
If you're on XBOX I can give you some protection.
---
Not a forced reroll. A removal from the loot roll. If there is no chance to receive a TSE in survival mode and someone has one it they would be widely reported.
---
If you have an open windows or doors and have like an interactive objects nearby, people can just press E and get teleport inside.
---
Oops I misread the wiki page
---
But..isn't that the point of roleplaying? I mean, if your role is going to be asshole...who gets to dictate what that means?
---
Correct but some people including me are getting annoyed that we have great piles of prepared for traiding with players bulks and half of available resources are in units
---
Bethesda hurt me 
---
Ah yes. We're on the same then. Crashing servers are a plague in this game.
---
I mean .. IT IS role playing. If they are in fact role playing. 
---
As a raider there are times I run up to peoples camps I run across randomly and blow them up, laughing and using the taunt emote ... Y a' know .. cause people don't talk :/.
---
Then when I get killed .. thats all in the fun. 
---

I‚Äôm not even sure I have that much play time on my 10yo WoW main. I sincerely doubt this game will remain relevant (even with expansions and DLC) for more than a year.
---
You might want to invest in faster ram and/or close pointless background applications.
---
The reason I brought it up was because I kept seeing people saying it wasn't real.. and then some guy tried to trade me yesterday when I hadn't played a month or two and I mentioned that trade bug that no one could prove.  He walked away mumbling to his friend about how I was an asshole.  lol
---
There is a restaurant station that head an office. About 5 your wires and 5 face there
---
I definitely play Raider. Lock your extractors, Lock your purifiers, I'm raidin' everyone up in here.
---
Most diseases are just meh anyway. I think theres only a handful I bother to cure anyway. I just let em run their course.
---
Just do it solo or don't go into the same silo as someone else. Is this someone coming in 10 minutes after you ? Maybe keep an eye on the map to make sure you alone and if you see someone, stop doing the work. My first experienced was ruined because I went into a silo and someone showed up at the same time, I should of left, but then I rushed it with a friend. I did it solo next time and had a good experience, felt like a real quest.
---
But to answer your question, it doesn't matter who enters the nuclear card or keycode, I guess stand by the targeting machine so you get to drop the nuke. Did the person drop the nuke or just enter the code ?
---
In that case it ought to have reset it then if you broke it all down then rebuilt it.
---
I feel like I should permanently change my name to Glowing Pustules.
---
I take any workshop I see claimed and I have only been killed once. And I know exactly what you are talking about and it isn‚Äôt that big of an issue.
---
The PvP stuff everyone is getting worked up over is likely to work as a companion piece to the Factions system. Responders vs. Raiders, etc. 
---
I think people are upset with it because the current PvP model is pointless. In the future with Factions it might have more purpose. Not only will a raider be a threat from the moment you see them, you'll also have a good chance of having potential back up because another good guy is CAMPed nearby.
---
We're being fed small puzzle pieces I think. Not in the best way, but it is what it is.
---
Congrats! Been wishing for one for the longest time, but still no luck.
---
Also, you need a new girlfriend.
---
The rumor I was mentioning was the one where they could steal your favorited items and shit.  Like people had their current weapons being jacked or something.
---
The distinction between griefers and raider should be (bc these terms aren't set in stone yet) is that griefers  abuse game mechanics and exploits to mess with people.
---
First time this happened to me I was a little concerned lol
---
Then we'd end up with two versions of the game, one with hilariously broken and overpowered weapons and one without. Bethesda would still have the job of fixing the mess they made in Adventure mode.  
---
I think a global resolution for both game modes would be for the best, and simply removing TSEs from one mode does not accomplish this.
---
Well for me it matters. A big studio like bethesda releasing a game in this state is unforgivable. They have the financial means to release a fame 300x better than this. I would only accept this if the game was coming from a small indie studio.
---
or just open a window and put their power armor through.

---
1) PS4 (first generation)  
---
2) LZRakaMAD  
---
4) Here are some ideas about general UI and navigation:
---
* **Navigation:**  
---
Fallout UI relies heavily on tabs, therefore, it should have a consistent set  of controls for their navigation. In the Pip-Boy, for instance, we use R1/L1 to navigate through the *main* *tabs* (Stat, Items, Data, and Radio) and Right-Dpad/‚ÄãLeft-Dpad to navigate through the *secondary tabs*  (Weapons, Apparel, etc.). When trading, however, we use R2/L2‚Äã ‚Äãto switch between the character and the vendor and R1/L1 to switch *secondary tabs*. There should be only one set of buttons for the *main tab* navigation and one for the *secondary tab* navigation. This stands for all the other menus, too.
---
* **Item secondary tab:**  
---
A  set of secondary tabs is not enough to organize the dozens of different  items that each may contain. I would like to have the items in each secondary tab grouped by some feature. The best example is the Aid category, which encompasses healing items, uppers, food, drink, magazines and bobbleheads. It would be nice to have these items grouped by some common feature and have the ability to collapse/expand these groups. Another example: group the Weapons category by DMG type  (Ballistic, Energy, Explosive, Radiation, etc.) or class (Small guns,  Big guns, etc.).
---
* **Items‚Äô naming and marking:**  
---
The  adjectives defining a Legendary item‚Äôs effect, an item‚Äôs class (Heavy,  Sturdy, etc.) or installed mods (Silenced, Leaded, etc.) should be placed at the end of the item‚Äôs name. Because items are listed  alphabetically, this way we would have all the related items next to each other, instead of scattered around the list.  
---
Moreover, at the moment you have to inspect a Legendary item in order to see all of its  effects. This may be solved with a tooltip message popping up when pressing a button or hovering the cursor over the item for a short period of time.  
---
Finally, the plans and mods categories need a complete revision. Some are impossible to tell apart and it is often not  clear what they do (plans) or which item they are for (mods). This also means that the CAMP building system need some adjustment: it is very difficult or even impossible to understand which plan would unlock which items.
---
* **Compass icons:**  
---
It  is impossible to tell different objectives apart when tracking multiple  quests. Each quest should have a different icon colour or a different icon set. Same goes for player icons when in a team.
---
* **World map:**  
---
We should be able to pan the map instead of having to move the cursor near the edge.  
---
Moreover, it would be nice to have a shortcut button to fast-travel to the CAMP, instead of constantly having to find it on the map.
---
I never used any glitches or exploits. I was fully aware of them but opted out, for I don't see the point of cheating. I was 32 at the end of beta, then I was 100 before the first xp nerf and 300 before they halved xp for glowing ones. So perhaps I was staying ahead of the curve.
---
east of morgantown north of bolton greens is a cat house. full of plastic cat bowls. you can even drop your camp inside.
---
i use the barn set, and it drives me nuts that the roof doesn't have those white strips on the middle piece.
---
it's hardly half, and not everyone bulks because it's seen as a waste of plastic
---
Thank you for being so open to discussion, I guess.
---
I'll check there next. Thanks for the tip!
---
Don't worry once you reach level 250+ after 700hrs of game play you will get bored and hate it /s 
---
I just find super mutants, kill them and then scrap their laser weapons and super sledges, plastic in there....
---
I'll tell you what I experienced first hand. Somebody was requesting items from my inventory and I was setting the price to 0. They were requesting plans and I already learned them all, so they were all duplicates. So I set the price to 0. Then I noticed while I was setting the price to 0 they requested another one, and the other one automatically set the price to 0 instead when I clicked to set the previous one to 0. So then I realized this is how it was happening. And people could have been requesting anything and accidentally through that bug set the price to whatever 0, 10, 100, 500, whatever. If it was set in the time period between the first and second request. I'm 99% sure that is how it was happening. But then people started talking about people having their weapons out, or not having their weapons out, and a lot of nonsense because they didn't know how it was happening.
---
I miss bioshock :/
---
Don't think I've had that first one happen tbh. That 2nd bug tho, omfg. I have having to just stand there for 2 min, otherwise you get locked up
---
Same, so many changes I'd like to see üòì
---
For balancing reasons they would probably need to make it either expensive and cost a cap to craft or not allow it to be compatible with Super Duper perk. otherwise you could just print caps. Though I would love to be able to make the other Nuka-Cola flavors instead of being forced to buy them at the Whitesprings. 
---
I'd actually be ok with this, if I wasn't afraid of the possibility that Bethesda continue to botch weapon balancing and survival mode ends up an absolute disaster, that I'd then be trapped in.  
---
Maybe allow people to copy their character over, but once they've done so the two stay separate?
---
There is a perk that drops them when you die :) so they are perfect for kamikaze atacks  
---
Let the motherfucker burn
---
She just doesnt get it. 
---
This is really weird. I've opened this link in safari (iPhone) and everything seems to work ok. Do you have the latest iOS? I have iOS 12.1.2, will update to 12.1.3 
---
Yeah. I personally don't trade because then they get to see your stuff and decide to take the workshop etc. If I want to give somebody something I just put it in a paper bag. And I don't really  need anything from anyone. But if they put stuff in a bag I'll have a look.
---
That's sad to hear. I hope the wise Mothman guides her towards the right path.
---
In my experience the clean boxes degrade over time. But yeah I get where you're coming from. Not being able to substitute purified water for recipes that require boiled water makes no sense either.
---
golf balls and cigarettes around whitespring

list here of all items with plastic:
---
[https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Category:Fallout\_76\_items\_containing\_plastic](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Category:Fallout_76_items_containing_plastic)
---
Would love to see centaurs or floaters. I would also like to see more Deathclaws.
---
Pretty much anything from previous games, as long as it fits in the canon. Except nightstalkers. Fuck nightstalkers.
---
either vaccinated is bugged or the die rolls never favor me because I got that perk specifically because I was sick of using the somewhat rare disease cures and I still got diseases like all the time...  also thru hiker is bugged or something because I constantly need to eat and drink
---
Yeah, but one of the hardest games to level up in of all times was Final Fantasy XI. I remember when you died and did not have enough of an exp buffer you deleveled.  You would find people who were level 74 or 73 after a dynamis run had failed in the main cities. 
---
Such a weird feeling when fighting some of those HNMs and people are just dropping left and right and their gear is being stripped off them due to the delevel lol
---
Again, that is the developers idea of what they look like. It's down to each individual person to decide their own appearance 
---
As it stands today everyone will get to bring those TSE and lvl perks with them making some players extremely powerful and others sitting ducks. TSE will always be OP. If the variants were split it would be much less powerful. Explosive with anything but two shot or instigating would be fine. Those 3 should be mains only like the armor has mains and secondary slots.
---
So your response is to allow both modes to be extremely broken?
---
Carry bowls, as previously memtioned. Watoga highschool cafeteria. Golf balls at the golf course good too. Honestly though, scrap laser rifles and you'll have plenty
---
My advice, when it comes to games is...don't trust what other people say and experience it for yourself. Because one man's trash is another man's treasure... 
---
That might be it. I haven't updated my phone in awhile. I'll try another browser. 
---
You're comparing real life simulation to a video game. If a raider had mechanics to exploit then you bet your ass they would 
---
I kinda disagree with you there. I don't really mind getting oneshot if the build was specced for it, in which case it has to give up on other things- usually survive-ability. legendaries are just instagibs all around, though.
---
expanding on that, you also don't need legendaries for farming or pve in general. a sniper shouldn't be able to down scorchbeasts with the same proficiency as a heavy gunner.
---
You speak the true true.
---
Fallout 4 also had significantly larger dungeons, and more of them. A lot of the buildings in 76 take a total of 10 minutes to explore thoroughly. The only ones I remember taking any amount of time to explore were Big Bend Tunnel (although that was fairly linear and still only like 20 minutes) and the brotherhood asylum place (forgot the name). A lot of them are also overworld buildings - which I don‚Äôt generally have a problem with but it seems like they‚Äôre much less detailed so that they‚Äôll be less resource intensive.
---
I use emote the "Call for Help" for "I need Medic"
---
Well that was terrifying, but praise be! Plastic! Thank you. 
---
Happened while I was holding onto lots of junk too lol. Luckily I managed to get back to my lunch bag full of goodies. 
---
I can max sell vendor Caps by spending 20 minutes in Harper's ferry gathering weapons and drugs.
---
But they don't, and it's not intended in game, either.
---
[PS4] A lot of people are talking about making a new character mandatory for survival mode.  I don't like that idea at all.  I put 100's of hrs. into my character and it took me forever to get the weapons and armor I wanted.  I definitely don't wanna build another character.  Just balance the PVP properly and there won't be issues.  People are worried about a Level Playing Field, but the playing field is never leve,l there's always new under leveled players and always existing high-level players.
---
Literally every other way to do any of those things is easier and faster
---
My first TSE I got was a harpoon gun. I felt so let down but I was determined to roll with it. I modded it out, changed my build around it, and realized it actually is my favorite weapon in any fallout. I feel like Captain Ahab. [https://imgur.com/rZC8aHJ](https://imgur.com/rZC8aHJ)  
---
 It's amazing -- shooting explosive flechette harpoons that do over 1000 damage each (and my build isn't even fully complete yet as I haven't started putting points into Heavy Weapons).  And it's practically impossible to run out of ammo, because it's a harpoon gun, which means almost every body you loot will have between 2-10 harpoons on them, even though you can one shot it and everything nearby.  
---
You're right, but it's not a very efficient use of time when you could just run through a high school and grab pumpkins etc. etc. The problem is, you can't know whether they'll be there. This is the first time it's taken *this long* to find some. 
---
lol i want one for my camp.
---
My response is that Bethesda find a way to balance the variants Two-shot and Explosive so that they aren't OP. There are many avenues they could explore to accomplish this.
---
Raid, take bounties, get nukes, build your dream camp, explore, whatever you want. Dont let people tell you that being a raider is greifing. Its not. Its role playing and its fun.
---
I only found cats about a week ago.
---
Thank you for the tips.  I will give it another try tonight 
---
Congrats! It feels so fucking good, right?
---
Start practicing jump shots. Also, my recommendation is to not equip this gun indoors, unless there is a wide area, rather switch to melee.
---
Because of the area damage, accidentally shooting others, or camps, or even robots at Whitesprings will happen, so be careful.
---
Finally, if you run with pacifist enabled, other players will jump in front of you, and you will die‚Äî then you‚Äôll be looted. This has happened to me numerous times, especially during Scorched Earth.
---
Spatial awareness is key. Good luck!
---
Im pretty sure you don't mind using duping and such hell your probably one of them. Im just justifying why when it comes down to it I'm going to start killing any player that shows up at my camp. 
---
Nope....crappy old Devs are to blame.
---
OP seemed more worried about physical space. The registry entries for the game will literally impact nothing whatsoever in the grand scheme of getting back that hard drive space. You are more than welcome to go into detail and assist the OP with these steps. As a registry player I am not, except for making rainmeter launch faster on boot :P
---
Let's compromise give me a raider skin for my xo1 and I'll give you a safe space on the map where you can pretend it's not the end of the world. if your not a wolf your dinner.
---
No. I have two. Painted one. 
---
I can be lol
---
all you need is the code, which can be found on the internet
---
Yes I have one piece. But only 1. Gear drops in this game is pretty bad and not many people duped vanguard/sentinels b4 duping was mostly fixed, so it's hard to buy from people.
---
Well there will be always ppl that will exploit the game. Its bethesdas job to  track them down and remove them from the game, also they should change the bobblehead stacking, or limit the amount u can own,  TSE weapons are being  nerfed and i am happy for that because it makes the game too easy. . i have two TSE's:  One of them i found and one of them i bought, idk if its a duped one or not. But why should i not own a TSE if almost  every player above lvl 50 owns one. I am against duping aswell but bethesda took action too slow.  There are alot of TSE's around but within a year or more it will become more rare again.  New players will come, players that play the game now, having loads of TSE might get bored and quit playing.  In my opinion, this new game mode, survival will attract the pvp players but also the dupers and griefers.  And they will complain again  about how the game is 'unbalanced'. Because Qbethesfa  will allow to use you existing character in that mode. Although idk if its with all your gear or not.. I think everyone in that mode should start a new character.  And in the adventure mode, leave it how it is.  Ok alot of ppl have TSE weapons, but if they dont use it on you and only on the creatures... Who cares right? 
---
Yeah, maybe some mobs will cause disease regardless of disease protection or it's bugged. If i understood correctly, then Thru Hiker doesnt reduce your hunger or thirst, only food weights.
---
I mean...you ARE an asshole. Just own it.
---
Yup that's one method. It is comparing active eanings to passive earnings where you can just do anything else instead.
---
It‚Äôs a decision you need to make early based on your gameplay style.  
---
Some people prefer blasting through areas with friends and going ‚ÄúHey dude, look at this skeleton with all these surgical supplies next to it‚Äù, everybody awes and moves on.  
---
Others prefer playing solo and listening to the holotape next to the skeleton to find out what happened.  
---
Unfortunately, the gameplay design doesn‚Äôt allow for both. It‚Äôs hard to listen to a holotape and get immersed when there‚Äôs screaming ghouls, rat-a-tat-tat‚Äôs from your friends Assault Rifle and he‚Äôs telling you about how his coworker lit himself on fire today.
---
None of this helps me much. Only maybe for Laser Gatling, but even then it dies quicker than most ballistic weapons and does really low dps.
---
Of course they dont, they CANT. They are AI programming and exploits are never intentional. I'm not going to debate with someone that cant understand how to use logic and rational thinking. Have a nice day
---
Earlier I got like 2k caps from someone who wanted to take my workshop and kept seeking revenge. I got a few new plans (go find them easier or faster), junk and steel and ammo, while sitting at a workshop doing nothing. And fast traveling for free from one side of the map to the other. Plus you get the 20 caps who you clear the mobs, making it pretty much free to start with. I have Contractor max rank so I don't even use any of my own resources setting up the extractors. I could be off farming legendaries while they are passively producing junk, steel, ammo, etc. All I have to do is fast travel back for free and pick them up every so often.
---
Yeah that's where I found mine, might be a definite drop from there
---
R u on xbox?
---
I noticed jumping helps.
---
oh sorry, I meant all night long
---
Are you really gatekeeping roleplaying?
---
I'm more of a Fasnacht Man kinda guy. 
---
Never had the first bug, but the second yeah.. Loading so long and oh boy when u press the pip boy button... 
---
I never heard anything about players being pissed over Super Mutants and BoS. It also seems childish to get mad since the older games take place years after this one. The story started in Fallout 1, which took place is 2161. The current year is 2102. It's no where near outlandish or unreasonable that super mutants and the BoS originated before Fallout 1
---
An entire thread complaining about people being assholes in a post apocalyptic setting. Lol
---
I have fireproof 1 on... I dont have alot of Endurance points. 
---
There is still a soft cap. Once you get your perk deck finished and geared up the only difference will be practice.
---
TSE will always be OP in the gun models everyone uses. You can‚Äôt change the damage value of the base lever action or the shotgun because it‚Äôs TSE. Think about it two shot and explosive will never be equal to any other variant because it‚Äôs 2 explosive bullets for 1.
---
Yeah if u have the marsupial mutation it helps. 
---
Where did you get it?
---
Yea... Gonna enjoy it while it still has the power. 
---
That's very helpful. There were a few items I didn't know about I'll have to keep an eye out for. 
---
Mr. Pickman, I presume.
---
Following along with Fallout 76 drama and playing the game was a mindbending experience.  You could literally see the ripple effect of youtubers uploading their drama and then a bunch of misinformed videos flying outwards in ripples.
---
I know people don't like hearing it, but it was some scifi level shit.  The YouTube algorithm (FUCKING AI) pushing the most interactive (NEGATIVE) Fallout 76 videos.. convincing thousands of people that never wanted to try the game in the first place that it was ABSOLUTE SHIT.  You could see how easy it would be for an AI to take over the world.. lmfao.  And now the Fo76 drama videos are only slowly trickling in and they are desperate attempts to revitalize that cash cow.. like saying the game is going free to play.
---
Bethesda fucked up HARD.. A LOT.. but the game was and is DECENT, at a minimum.
---
It actually is. They wanted the game to have drama where you dont know if another player is friend or foe. They even said similar things in their latest inside the vault issue. 
---
Is this a dude , white Knightin? Or someone who has experienced it themselves ? 
---
There's ton of trolls online. I don't think a psa is going to stop them from being them ... unfortunately.  
---
However , its an incredibly easy fix.  You can simply block them.  
---
with the upcoming TSE nerf, i don't see how TSE will always be OP unless you're talking strictly about pve.
---
Fireproof lv.3 + a padded torso negates the explosive damage.
---
I'm playing a pistol build with an anti-armor pistol and i don't even need to use my tse to pvp unless opponent has a full assassin/sentinel. in which case even current TSE are worthless. 
---
Depends on what you think griefiny is
---
It‚Äôs a safe bet that people who are complaining of constant disconnects are complaining because 76 is the only game that does it.  
---
I live in a major city, have gigabit fibre, went out of my to open up ports for this game and still suffered from insane latency and frequent server drops.  
---
No other game does this. It‚Äôs widely reported. The only common factor is the game itself. It‚Äôs safe to lay blame on the game.
---
Indoors is no good... The silo was fine and went quickly. I use my TS lever inside. 
---
it's not connected to your level, the budget is the same no matter what level
---
I equip Ammosmith and Super Duper, and craft the hell out of Mini Nukes.  I have a two shot with 10% increased damage while aiming, and with demolition x5 and bloody mess x3, I see over 1000 damage. Its not the greatest, but fun as hell especially during Scorched Earth. Between the whistling, explosions and the mass destruction of  ads, its like being an extra on the set of a Michael Bay flick üòÉ
---
It depends on the build, really. There are plenty out there that don't really require you to sacrifice a whole lot, and power-armor being a thing really helps builds with survive-ability problems and carry weight.  
---
But I know what you mean. Bethesda need to put more work into the trade-offs of certain weapon types so that they can do the damage that they feel like they should, the entire category of heavy guns and explosives being a prime example. A hunting rifle bullet can do more damage than a missile.
---
Harder to kill than sentry bots? Lol, na. 
---
While I'm not a PA user, I get the frustration. Imagine if all your food and drugs were just called "aid". 
---
ITT: people defending griefing
---
And you have to take into account that there are people  who don't have enough carry weight to carry all the shotguns, rifles and stuff to max sell to all vendors in one go. So you will waste more caps hopping back to Harper to get more.
---
I'm not a griefer, don't do pvp at all but it's absolutely a part of the game. ANY online game like this. But it definitely plays a part in the world of fo76. It's 25 years after a nuclear war, the people left are potentially friendly, surviving the wastes by cooperating with other survivors. Or, they're completely ruthless psychopaths surviving by killing and stealing. 
---
Lewisburg has Plastic Plates and utensils galore
---
SBQ
---
lol yeah I'm disappointed there aren't very many post-apocalyptic themed decorations. 
---
You make some good points but the problem is they can actually use those ill-gotten advantages on players, too.  Claiming workshops flags you for pvp even if you are in pacifist (and rightly so), so they absolutely can use them on you.
---
I don't care that these people or these items exist.  They don't influence my gameplay at all because I don't use them... until an exploiter with them shows up to grief me.
---
I don't think your point is that non-cheaters should give up on workshops, and this doesn't happen all the time, but it happens enough.  It's toxic and it's incredibly destructive to people who have played without exploiting the game.
---
That definitely does not apply for steel. I'm sitting on one right now and I get 20 steel scraps when it's full. Thought lead was the same, but I could be wrong. Have not ran one in a couple of weeks. 
---
I remember being surprised because i had read all the complaints when they changed that, and was expecting to get ore, but did not.
---
Haha we did it tho.
---
Next time I won't be so drunk. I fell into the fissure twice. 
---
Not enough people use hunter/hunted for it to work. Besides that, outside of the workshops and certain events, starting PVP puts the attacker at a disadvantage.
---
I haven't had either one of those. But I have been experiencing this bit where after the initial load, I spawn on the map but cant do anything. After about 10 seconds, it goes back to the loading screen and respawns me. 
---
Other "bug" I have been encountering is with sniping. When I am done using my scope, sometimes the view wont reset and I'll remain in the scope view. I have to smash my controller sometimes to get back to normal view.
---
Blowing up someone's camp who you are actively engaged in combat with is nothing like punching someone's face and saying that's life. You're comparing a sucker punch to a legit strategy to claim victory over an opponent. They were fighting over a workshop, they guy had a camp near by, it's fair game to attack it and focus your enemies attention on that. A man can not fight a war on two fronts.
---
Thx man, glad it helped!
---
Next time I won't be so drunk. I fell into the fissure twice. :) 
---
EA would put it behind a paywall or only allow you to get it randomly via loot crates. Let's be fair &amp;mdash; at least you can buy anything on the Atom store by simply playing the game; they're pretty easy to earn if you keep your eye on active challenges.
---
Did you get beat again little buddy
---
I do the workshops but i also realises that i will get engaged at pvp. Although last time i claimed a workshop and no one came to fight me
---
If I could give you gold for this wonderful tip then I would, but, alas, I'm a crazy broke graduate cat lady.
---
Thank you for posting this!
---
Sorry I don't know what that stands for.
---
Probably the weirdest answer here..... MacbooküòÇ. It runs surprisingly Ok on my macbook !  Graphics setting at lowest, Resolution 1280 x 800.  Can still get 60 fps ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.
---
How much time have you spent playing? Have you played anything else? I‚Äôm not trying to mock you for playing what you enjoy, just genuinely curious as to how you‚Äôve had the endurance to play this godforsaken game so long
---
Scorch Beast Queen
---
I am more appalled by the absolute butchering of the English language in here, from people on all sides of this topic. 
---
It's almost as if people are going for the high score of how many words can have red underlines before posting. 
---
Isn't griefing by definition meta?  You identify the player as a real human target, not a character. And you often exploit the game mechanics while doing so.  It's not roleplaying, in the same way that finding out where a player lives and setting fire to their apartment is not "roleplaying as a Raider".   
---
Shouldn't Raiders be taking over player's bases anyway?
---
Unfortunately not really willing to drop any of my luck perks for class freak so likely not
---
Which is fine, I kind of like the idea of a medic spurning mutations.
---
To answer your question yeah cats are definitely tameable, they also don't act like guards attacking things though and instead just kinda wander around your camp
---
Do you have a crystal ball? What evidence do you have that "TSE will always be OP"?   
---
As I said, there are many avenues Bethesda can explore to fix the problem. The description for the explosive variant reads "bullets explode for area damage". Why not make them do just that? No bonus damage, projectiles damage an area rather than a single point, remove scaling with Demolition's Expert. Couple that with the change Bethesda's already announced, when the Two-Shot varient's second bullet will only deal 20% and that'll already start bringing it in line with other legendary combos. That's just one idea that'd fix the problem that I farted out in a minute.
---
I meant abusing the mechanics in a way the devs didn't intend.
---
First i didn't say its equivalent. I said "i feel its in the range of equivalency." (i guess interpret that as you will.) look at it this way, if i was building a PC with specs close to the Xbox one x as suggested in this article:
---
[https://www.pcworld.com/article/3200767/gaming/xbox-one-x-pc-build.html](https://www.pcworld.com/article/3200767/gaming/xbox-one-x-pc-build.html)
---
I would use the AMD FX-8300
---
Now comparing what i might use, and what i currently have:
---
[https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/AMD-FX-8300-vs-AMD-FX-6300/m7163vs1555](https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/AMD-FX-8300-vs-AMD-FX-6300/m7163vs1555)
---
its only marginally better.
---
I am not trying to play the game on Ultra mode, I'm trying to play it in a Stable, stutter free mode. Regardless, being "under par" on the CPU still does not explain why the launcher scan has an issue properly reading PC specs.
---
I don't deny I'm an asshole. But that does not mean I am being one when I blow up your base in a game.
---
I'm doing what the game intended for me to do. I mean you don't have to like it at all, it is the truth though.
---
Did you honestly think raiders were just going to run around singing kumbaya to everyone they came across? lol
---
Do you need a shovel ?
---
I had an issue where I needed to bury some remains but I had no shovel :/ 
---
Nobody can be protected from a one shot kill. Lol but it could be kinda fun to roleplay the "damsell in distress" Pm me yr g.t? I have caps if your a merc for hire
---
Without Conflict we do not Grow
---
Tarberry juice and BlackBerry juice are both 2 ap regen.  Corn soup is 3ap regen.
---
I opened the post just to state that. As a Combat Armor aficionado, I was really happy when I finally found the helmet, only to find out it is purely cosmetic.
---
Half an hour later I found the Tattered Mole Head. 
---
No one at Bethesda actually thought people would put up with the bugs long enough to reach 100+
---
I finally let go of my hunting rifle in favour of a lever action. Much better rate of fire like you said, plus mine is 1* and my hunting rifle wasn't. No regrets.
---
Best I can tell is some easy XP and a few aid items.  I have not noticed anything of value but that may be a rare drop since this quest is repeatable and data spwans regularly in some locations

Player turrets in workshops seem to have "dumb" AI.
---
Turrets at player CAMPs seem ok, but sometimes they seem like a waste of resources at workshops. They don't seem to shoot enemies on sight even when they have a clear 360 degree vantage. 
---
I've had multiple workshop structures destroyed by things as weak as mole rats because I trusted my turrets to work properly while I was on the opposite side of the workshop dealing with other enemies.
---
Thanks.
---
I would recommend just trying it out. I believe it does a bit more damage, and the last patch fixed the reload bug. However, it doesn't have a magazine slot to mod, and it uses 45 instead of 308 rounds.
---
I think where all this is coming from is that pre-release Bethesda made a big deal about the anti-griefing systems they'd put into place. So a large faction of the playerbase goes into the game thinking things like destroying a camp can't or won't happen. When their base gets trashed, they then get upset because it's not quite the game experience they believed they'd signed up for.
---
Amen to that
---
See it does that for me then goes away next time I open it, I feel like a chad when I pull them all out
---
I get that one all the time - take your clothes off and put them back on.
---
Sweet very helpful
---
No, I haven't played anything else. On average, several hour a day since release. If I were to play entirely solo, perhaps I'd have moved on by now. But met a fair amount of people on my travels and typically invite them to Discord and typically we have enough to form at least one team and so the social aspect of it all maintains a good amount of momentum. Also had a lot of fun levelling up two other chars into the 50ies. I find it's genuinely a pleasant environment to hang out in, even if with my level and equipment there are no real PVE challenges left.
---
Bethesda could just upgrade the "ignore feature" of the game. If a player is attacking your camp and kills you, then you hit ignore, and boom. That player can no longer deal damage to you, or your camp, can't see you on the map, and can't interact with you. But same applies to you in regards to damaging them or their shit.
---
I get that it's probably frustrating to deal with higher levels that have insane damage bonuses on super legendary weapons, with near unlimited aid and ammo, but it's 100% part of the game. If raiders were capable of shitting all over you in game, they absolutely would, they would steal, kill, pillage, rape, bully, and torture as much as they could. They are ass holes, shit stains, scum, and they deserve to be put down like rabid dogs. Still, part of the game, and yes it is allowed to role-play as a raider and yes, they are more than likely going to grief until they simply can't any more.
---
Just wait til the survival server launches and then all the op griefers will be running around one shotting everyone, then fast traveling to vault 76 or the players camp and repeating. It's going to be a fucking blood bath shit show of griefers
---
I was just referring to markings in general. A lot of players don't know you can reduce the intensity of dirt and other imperfections.
---
For the second one, it seems to help if you stare straight up at the sky for a few seconds after loading in. It helps the world load around you faster when there's less strain on your GPU. I notice this on PC with an older GPU, but may be worth a try for you. 
---
**EDGE**
---
Does the player who is "invisible" do this, or the player who can't see him?
---
welcome to reddit cry baby
---
You're going to have to exain what you mean? They make you unable to be pvp'd until you're lvl 5 then give you a huge boost against high lvl griefing players. The only exploits that aid in griefing are the bobbleheads, but other than that my personalnexperience hasn't beem bad. 
---
hi, if it's your first play through, you should prob just save all your atom points. Once you are good at the game every time you sign in, do the daily challenges and the weekly as you please.
---
every new character yields lots of their own atom points but it's not a job lol it's just a game.
---
the point I think is that people very often have too much and require tracking their favorite costumes down, this makes roleplaying more easy.
---
I don't anybody is supposed to have everything in the shop but it's pretty easy t have lots of choices with your atom,even if you only play an hour a day. 
---
gl n hf. challenges screen while you are in game if you don't know what I am saying.
---
personally I wear a random combination of stuff from the atom.
---
Oh as well down the line, if it does happen that modders get there hands on changing actual files that are accessible by all players that means modders (might if its really popular and fits in with the lore) get paid for their work, as well clan costumes or signs on clothing down the line. none of that is in the game right now, but it's possible down the line, and you'd get it all from there.
---
Don't poor money into the atom shop. if you do it when you have already saved up so that you now always have a surplus (I did that, but I also say nope to most of the stuff in the atom shop). 
---
The game has perk cards to do more damage while destroying someone's base
---
You cant really grief in this game, you can always just block them.and change servers. At worst they destroy your camp which is cheap to repair with contractor 2
---
I don‚Äôt have a crystal ball just common sense 2 for one explosive bullets with explosive perks in a 1v1 situation will defeat the guy without it especially if they don‚Äôt wanna run that one set of armor or waste perk points on fireproof. We‚Äôll see but I‚Äôll stand on it continuing to be OP until there split. You just don‚Äôt like idea cause you enjoy using them. I do too. However I do believe Bethesda will take a page from bungie and change everyone‚Äôs rolls.
---
Each +1 Strength is +5 carry weight
---
The affects won‚Äôt be shown if u are in power armor 
---
I would check just about any kitchen in the game.
---
All night long doesn't actually make you eat and drink less. I found out the hard way too. It makes the effects of being hungry and thirsty not as bad. Basically the opposite of rejuvenated. 
---
really?  so is there no perk I can take that makes me need to eat or drink less?
---
In stories you generally take a characters actions at face value without breaking the fourth wall to justify their actions by saying ‚Äúthat‚Äôs what the writers wrote.‚Äù Even if scripted you have to grant characters some autonomy and assess that they have their own motivations. 
---
You don‚Äôt watch a movie and appreciate it for the writers putting everything on rails. When Spider-Man cuts his chute and stays on the spaceship in Infinity War you don‚Äôt say, ‚Äúwow, what cheap writing? He was supposed to go back to Earth but the writers are just gonna deus ex machina him back to the spaceship.‚Äù No. You just assess that it is in Spider-Man‚Äôs character, acting with his own motivations, to do that. It‚Äôs scripted, but ignore that. 
---
So if we‚Äôre playing within this world, and in this world there are observable trends for what makes who belong to which faction, then to role play as a member of that faction you would adhere to those trends. 
---
I‚Äôm not saying there‚Äôs anything wrong with griefing or being an asshole in general. But it doesn‚Äôt really rise to ‚Äúrole play‚Äù if you‚Äôre breaking all the conventions of that role. 
---
Funny seeing this post! Had my first yesterday! White springs was dead, so thought I'd farm it. Decided to take a nap surrounded by angry glowing ghouls? Never realised how time consuming the animation was untill that time!

---
I suspect there are bugs in the launcher/scan tool also. I don't think i have had as many issues in any other game compared to this. Don't get me wrong i enjoy playing, I just want something more stable, and i refuse to accept that all the blame lies with an older CPU.
---
Especially since many other people have said this is more or less FO4 with friends, and that game recommended  an AMD Phenom II X4 945. (which my current cpu is slightly better.)
---
Sure, i don't know what is going on behind the scenes to call for them recommending the newer CPU's but i largely suspect its because, well the game came out late 2018 and since they copy+paste most of their code from games to games they think that better PC hardware will make the glaring BGS issues more like minor bugs. But that's all conjecture.
---
Console players and PC players throwing shade at each other over what system they prefer to play on. Says a lot about gamer demographics, I think.
---
Yes, I showed up to intentionally misrepresent you because I have something to gain here. That makes perfect sense. I now completely understand that there was undeniably a bug that allowed people to trick other people into trading their items at no fault of their own and it was patched.
---
None of the above is true.
---
How about no, although it would be terrifying if it bent backwards like a possessed person and run at you on all fours. Call it the Mother-in-law.

U on xbox? I want an anti griefer squad too. Making strong teams is the only way forward I think. Id like a militia I can call on when I need vengence
---
Apocalypse Meow
---
Upvote as thanks for planner.
---
It would be cool if you could get sheet music (I'm sure someone else has probably already thought of this) that could change the tune you play... though it could get noisy if you had a group of people playing different tunes at the same time.
---
Are they wearable? Thought they were just a junk item.
---
1 - Xbox One
---
2 - apesttech
---
3 - I haven‚Äôt been able to play for two days now. Gets stuck on loading screen and keeps telling me, ‚ÄúServers not responding, controls temporarily disabled.‚Äù I‚Äôve tried resetting Xbox, deleting and installing again, hard resetting, starting a new character, etc. Nothing works. 
---
I did try it.. What made me try it was dropping a 1* bloodied lever rifle. And finding the lever rifle plans. Lol but before I invest in mats like springs to mass craft a bunch to break down to learn the mods I wanted to get a concensus 1st.
---
That's a very good point, thank you for that. But looking at it personally from my point of view, I would wear whatever I want if I was a raider. I wouldnt wear a bunch of rusty metal or leather armor pieces, I would scavenge for the best and wear that. But that's just me and my point of view and my actions I would take.
---
yeah this would be an excellent QoL improvement
---
Exactly. And even if we only go off raider styles from in game, they vary a lot still. 
---
- The Pack dress with animal masks and bright colors. 
---
- The Operators dress in suits and fancy clothing. 
---
- The Disciples dress like dark cultists.
---
- The Powder Gangers wear prisoner clothes and guard uniforms.
---
- The Great Khans dress like bikers.
---
- The Rust Devils use armor made of robot parts.
---
- The Trappers use a lot of fishing gear in their armor, namely the lobster trap helmet.
---
And raiders, especially the gang leaders, do use power armor occasionally too. Ashur in the Pitt or the leader of the Forged come to mind. 
---
Ok I'm not sure how many other ways I can put this. What if they CHANGED the Explosive variant, so that it doesn't scale with the Demolitions Expert perk? Like how I described in my last reply to you? Like, I dunno how else to say it but you really lack imagination in just how many directions Bethesda can go with this to make it balanced.  
---
And to be honest, I don't particularly enjoy using them. Not being able to point-blank shoot anything that's right in your face with a shotgun because you'll end up killing yourself isn't my idea of a fun shotgun. But I do use them, because they're the strongest weapons in the game right now and there's not many other reasons not to. Splitting the two variants, i.e, removing or grandfathering all existing TSEs is not the only option. Broaden your vision, dude.
---
GT is SpicyPapaCake, and of course I'll take the caps. üòÇ
---
\&gt;Most people online are male 
---
Source?
---
lol if you think I care about my gravitas on a reddit throwaway account.
---
Psn. Wish I had a computer cuz thats what all my friends are on.
---
I solo most the time.
---
3 dudes in some chameleon gear and one guy to goad griefers into attacking. 
---
Then BAM 3 other people begin griefing you.
---
Wouldnt it be nice-
---
I disagree. If this wasnt a intended part of the game, there would be greater punishment. 
---
i would like to know how invested bethesda is in this game. if sales were abysmal and bleeding users i dont see the content treadmll to go on much further. 
---
They're not a charity so what incentivizes them to deliver anything at this point? Other than saving face.
---
Same wtf
---
I've seen one in that junk yard looking place in the middle of the forest 
---
That's pretty nice. Why black and white though?
---
It ate my missle launcher once, that must've been a tasty stew....
---
Do you need the perks equipped relevant to energy weapons?
---
Most people in FO76 are male. Do you have ears and a microphone? Hearing a female voice is quite rare. It's certainly possible that a greater proportion of women don't use their microphone, but that couldn't possibly account for such a vast difference, evident to any but the most blind and deaf.
---
"Empath" would be a good mutation to consider though as a medic role-play. Maybe also "Herd Mentality" to force the need to group with others.
---
There junk but he's rping so ... Shrug..
---
Are you selling any and if so are you on Xbox 
---
I've gotten past just being a Jerk and plowing people over, I try to run around wearing just a over coat and no actual armor, usually shouting "Waaaaaaaaarrriooors, come out and plaaaaaaaaeeeeeeeeeaaay" I use a baseball bat with barbwire and try to provoke people to rumble. Being max caps I don't mind loosing 220 a pop  for when people get a decent chuckle out of it.
---
Though every now and then one person thinks they're hot @#$% for killing me. That's when I evolve to supreme troll master.
---
Reminds me of the lvl 30 with a 750 cap bounty heading towards my camp a couple hours after leaving vault 76, then I realized there was another digit.  Logged out so fast.
---
Yep there in every kitchen usually in the counters.
---
Since you have a good legendary, I would definitely recommend switching to the lever rifle. A hardened receiver does around 90 damage for me without any rifle perks.

The problem is duping. Now there r Tse everywhere, the game isn't right. If they can manage to keep the duping from affecting the survival, I'll be good to go. Obviously they're gonna fix the balance in pvp. It's not like they don't hear everyone upset about it. They are gonna fix the balance and the duping, then they will unleash the new mode. If u don't like the harsh wasteland of survival then go back to adventure mode w your 177. It's gonna be another long hard journey to the top but I'm excited to experience the REAL wasteland. 
---
Yeah, just like a lever action shooting a 45 round, wait....
---
Just like a .50 doing more damage than a 308, wait...
---
Sour, much? Just because you run into someone doesn‚Äôt make it greifing. What are you experiencing?
---
Scavenge for the best and wear that? Sooo you'd be role playing as brotherhood of steel no?
---
okay thank you
---
Plasma weapons actually hit things now, and ash/goo piles are actually lootable now. It was fixed one or two patches ago
---
No. They are designed to provide loot rarity. It is you who decides you need to collect every rare plan and every rare mod.
---
Game "balance" is bullshit in a game where we all have the exact same opportunities. There is no class system to balance here. Plus the whole nonsense of "balancing" class systems in RPGs to begin with only started because of a bunch of whiny manchildren couldn't play well together.
---
He probably just left the server
---
Thought this post was going to be related to those two St. Louis police officers that made  the headlines recently.
---
I understand your points and I like them, however based on the current way Bethesda has ‚Äúfixed‚Äù things a restructure like your talking about might as well be rocket science. I believe they will look at best practices in the industry and try to emulate them. Even without the demolition perk the gun I use currently does 500 damage. What your talking about would drop it to the 300 range. Show me a non TSE that continuously does that damage. 
---
Cool you can be part of the millitia Ive formed to take out griefers.
---
Fiancee and I get the invisible glitch all the time. It usually resolves itself for us if I quick switch weapons so you might wanna try that too.
---
Look, I have my moments, but it was abundantly clear from the outset that rushing through this game in particular was going to end in tears of frustration. I don't know why you do it to yourselves.
---
Wait until you finish story and realize how empty the game is 
---
Aside from legendaries, loot doesn't seem to scale with enemy level. That's probably intentional as maintenance costs don't increase either. 
---
this is awesome, thank you.
---
And our characters while we are at it.....and by that I mean I want me character name displayed in game and not my account name
---
Congrats, I got my first at level 152. A level 35 TSE dragon. Can't use it on just anything like the shotgun, but imo that just makes it more balanced
---
I agree. there needs to be an auto weekly update or something much like r/DestinyTheGame. There's no reason we shouldn't have the weekly nuke codes in a sticky post every week along with just a catch all for random posts. It would cut down on spam and make the whole sub much more tolerable.
---
R u asking if when one armor piece procs and ends, the other piece starts where the other finished? 
---
Because we are passionate about gaming man, simple. I‚Äôve been so good at certain games that I can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt stop.
---
You clearly aren't that invested in the Fallout community. There was a huge controversy about the lore and how Bethesda disrespects it. You also don't know that much about the lore, there's nothing wrong with that, but here is why your suggestion won't work: The Gun Runners haven't been established before 2131. The Gun Runners were also established on the West Coast not in West Virginia. 
---
I think your suggestion to put in new guns is cool but Bethesda shouldn't add the Gun Runners because of that.
---
Yah we need a distillery considering the perks attached to it
---
Ghouls have a decent chance of having one
---
Fallout Vegas M4/M16 styles. Also PLEASE offer a restoration mod to have Clean versions of weapons. For example the handmade would be amazing restored looking like a complete AK-47 with nice cherry wood and blued finish. 
---
First Fallout game where I just drop my Mini Nukes and Missles.
---
I like it
---
I think crouching hides you from the map. 
---
I mean, I am almost an anti stealth character and I have almost no trouble scoring sneak attack criticals back to back on the same enemy with non suppressed weapons, they still take crits in caution stance, and enemies just feel blind and deaf  in this game. 
---
Honestly I think a lot of these rules aren't hardcore enough.
---
I think instead of releasing Survival mode they should just be releasing PVP or non auto friendly worlds. I love the idea of this game, and I come from survival on other FOs, but right now HC players can still have fun; as well glitches plague the survival player not death. I don't think people or the game are ready for that mode yet, I could be wrong.
---
I think that they should try appeasing the bulk of players for now and the absolute Hardcores later, even if to do that they make an easy Survival mode right now, and a Hardcore Survival mode later.
---
I complain when I drink a beer and it hydrates me if I am not yielding an appropriate perk, honestly I think most people have forgotten already how hard these games get. People getting knocked back 20minutes of progression is not even a little with the old survival saving system, but its an enormous amount for everybody if it's a  crash. So right now I'm even not ready for survival or hardcore or whatever.
---
If they fix the balance as I hope and you say they will, then why would a forced reroll be needed?
---
Huh? So‚Ä¶ suddenly you can‚Äôt be a Raider just because the last regime died? Probably shouldn‚Äôt have any more Responders or Enclave members then too. Do you envision a post-apocalyptic world where everyone holds hands?
---
Explosive poop.
---
Best way is to try it for yourself, I did the same thing and I feel pretty dumb falling for the negativity.  That being said, I hope Bethesda starts trickling in more non robot NPCs.  Where are the sentient ghouls?  Brotherhood patrols?  They did write a pretty compelling backstory to the Raiders origins.  Just after the war there were more people reluctant to steal and kill since there was a small sense of moral obligation.  Guess 200 years of wasteland living can nullify it and become the bloodthirsty punks we know now.
---
Really, this is just more of a co-op fallout game and not an MMO, and that's perfect for me.  I think the negativity aside from the crashes and bugs was people expected another grindy loot shooter and didn't get that.  It's FO4 with forced survival and multiplayer slapped on.  It's enjoyable if you're a curious wanderer who reads all the things, but if you're all about high level endgame stuff, you'll lose interest quick.
---
Diarrhea*
---
Tons!
---
And yes the game is great.
---
PS join the brotherhood
---
I was by myself both times... grr.  He even told me to eff off
---
Kids these days
---
This is a great idea, I've always had to walk away from camps that didn't have stuff by their windows
---
Based on experience with others, I'd say most disconnects are server crashes. You can kind of see them coming sometimes, especially after a nuke zone's been around for a while. The server seems to have a memory leak, which is entirely in line with how previous creation engine games have behaved at our end.
---
Doesn't crouching or Invis hide your position?
---
Even more infuriating is the response I got from Beth:
---
"Greetings,
---
Thank you for contacting Bethesda Support.
---
I understand that you are experiencing an issue with stored or placed items affecting your C.A.M.P. budget. To help clear up any confusion regarding the C.A.M.P. budget, here is some additional information about how that¬†system works:
---
C.A.M.P. Budgets and Item Storage
---
Your C.A.M.P has space for a limited number of items, once you have reached that limit, you'll be prevented from placing additional items.
---
Items in your "stored" section in build mode will count against your C.A.M.P. budget even if they are not placed.
---
¬†
---
The percentage of a C.A.M.P.‚Äôs Budget that is being taken up by stored items and Blueprints will appear in the Budget bar.
---
If you are not able to edit or locate structures or items in your C.A.M.P. because they appear to be missing or unavailable, you can try moving your C.A.M.P. to a different location, which will blueprint your C.A.M.P., pick up your C.A.M.P. and move it.
---
When you move your C.A.M.P., your structures are bundled into blueprints which appear in the "stored" category, these also count against your budget so you should try to build the blueprinted items first.
---
If you get the message: "Can not place item: The workshop's budget has been exceeded," scrap items you have previously placed or items in your "stored" section until your budget is low enough to place the item.
---
In the event that you have lost an item in your C.A.M.P., please be aware that Customer Support does not have the ability to restore missing items or progress.
---
To provide any feedback about your experiences in¬†Fallout 76, you are always welcome to use the "Feedback" category under "Submit a Ticket" of the¬†help website.¬†You can also visit and discuss and provide feedback on our official forums¬†here.
---
Thank you for your patience and continued support.
---
Best regards
---
Bethesda Support"
---
So basically they didn't read my ticket.
---
I was under the impression when you're wanted, nobody shows on the map.
---
Holy f, will they get us some more ballistic fibre! If you put it in, it should come out when you break it down.
---
I'm not even going to attempt to dissect this dumpster-fire of a comment.
---
So? Weapon balance is a bullshit concept in a game without a class system. It is irrelevant. The reason why energy weapons are still useful is that they use different rare junk to repair, so carrying a backup laser pistol to plink at stuff you don't want to burn valuable springs on (I calculate amortized repair costs into my choices of what to use) is a legitimate strategy.
---
I have to agree they are just being lazy. Niether of the factions/npcs exsisted for quite some time after the war. They just wrote them in so they could reuse assets instead of creating an original faction. 
---
I mean looking at it now, I guess you can just stand there and wait
---
Wow. You‚Äôd think it would be like an instance
---
Guess I‚Äôll try and drop one 0230 idk
---
Yeah, consider how deep Pickman Gallery went.
---
PC.
---
Yes, yes, yes. I shouldn't need to have a googled map in front of me. 
---
Makes no difference in this context, sure. But there are plenty of topics where you see the same behaviour, and so the difference is that talking to those people is a waste of my time.
---
They might not hold themselves up to a certain standard, but I certainly do! 
---
Happens with out ts too. Could be a bug could be how horrible the servera are.
---
Damn
---
"omg Bethesda sucks they took the rp out of my rpg!"
---
"wtf why are all these griefers role playing?!" 
---
Isn‚Äôt much worse than fo4.... there‚Äôs the problem tho, you‚Äôre expected to produce better and better, not worse and worse. 
---
"Hell is other people."  -- Sartre
---
Seriously though, just enjoy yourself. There are a ton of possibilities in this game. No validation from anyone else required.
---
I don't know but I don't think you can see people who you are seeking revenge on on the map. But you can see their red dot on the compass if you are close enough I think. But they probably just fast travelled away because they are cowards and don't actually want PvP they just want a free kill from their comfortable little virtually invulnerable state.
---
Yea my phone and myself forgot how to spell it.
---
[Here's one.](https://i.ibb.co/GPHrJ75/fatman.jpg)
---
It... is beautiful!  
---
Great tool, thanks!
---
I really wish the mods would forbid people reviewing the game until they've hit level 30.
---
You don't know what you're talking about yet. If you still think it's great when you're 30+, fine, come back and crow about it. If you don't think it's as good, keep mum and keep playing, because typically your opinion will continue to decrease.
---
I played 400 hours of Fallout 4 last year and it was a LOT of Fallout 4. Playing a video game for 1400-2200 hours in a year is neither perfectly functional, nor healthy.
---
I mean yeah every now and then i roll around with a minigun and to much ammo, drop artillery and shoot up a place, maybe kill the guy and move on, if you leave the junk its role playing if you take the junk its griefing 
---
Science perk cards there's a few.
---
I‚Äôm asking if you can maintain invisibility with multiple pieces equipped.
---
I didn‚Äôt see anyone for a long time. I was checking in and off this time and then there he was, he came in right when I was protecting the chiefs
---
I swiped my card and he actually typed in the code faster then me and targeted white springs.
---
Annoyed I‚Äôm an old man and I wanted to drop my damn nuke!
---
my brother has been tryig to find a 3star legendary for about a month. the best he ever found was a 3 star rolling pin. it looks hella funny when he has his PA on lol
---
Yea I can see that but, wow no class I guess
---
Its just vanguard is also a highly sought after item so it would make since to have the dmg resistance plus dmg resistance from the sentinels
---
You've had a great time so far _because_ you're only level 27.
---
I asked for a source, not your personal experience. Your feelings don't count as factual data.
---
Guys, the game has PvP in it, get the fuck over it and move on
---
I am finding, more and more of the hostile players in FO76  are only attacking as pirates, they want something  from you, they steal your loot and hope you don't want to PVP them, and if you do 9 out of 10,  they log off ,and log back in,  and call you a bunch of names and make Idol threats that they are going to attack your camp, or they will tell you, we have screen shoted your name,  we know who you are we will becoming after you. It also seems it is the same groups of players and it only seems to go down Saturday mornings and it never seems to be a fair fight, you always end up loosing in a PVP ? Not sure if these guys have found another way  to hack the game or not, it has been something I have been noticing over the  last few weeks, the same 10 people, in the same groups, doing this more and more frequently, and the way they level up so quickly makes me wonder even more if something is up. Also, I have been attacked by these same guys for not wanting to trade or join a team with them. I end up blocking them because they are more than just hostile. If this was real world, than I  would have no problem with this kind of behavior, because they wouldn't see it coming. There behavior is kind of  overwhelming and kind of ruining the game abit. I think until Bethesda gets a better handle on this,  it is only going to get worse and worse. This is  Just my  radiated mass of  thoughts on the current gameplay. Anyways best Regards to the community, I look forward to seeing every one in the wasteland. 
---
Drop Site V9 will be clear of the blast 
---
I'm just really tired of getting rolling pins. Its a bit ridiculous.
---
maximum roleplay: raider powerarmor geared specifically with griefing perks
---
It's not my fault that Munchkins ruined the whole genre.
---
This is sad to see man, this is one of the only enjoyable parts of the quest line for me, this was easily completed in less than an hour for me and I wish there was more like it. Just play the game and it will complete itself
---
Like where?
---
maybe because the overall feel of the game is depressing as fuck, everyone is dead, it makes my character want to kill himself
---
&gt;I get tired of hunting for disease cure items, I'd like to keep some fresh.
---
I think this is where it would be the most beneficial. I don't enjoy having to collect everything I need for some of these recipes all at once before they start to spoil, it drives a really focused style of farming that I just don't dig. perhaps that's the intention, but I think being able to store some of this stuff at least for an extended period of time would be great.
---
\&gt;so good at games
---
lol, just lol. Those e-sports hucksters really got to you, huh?
---
Ive played all of them a couple times and they're still great
---
Says who? Why cant someone be a raider but wear combat or marine armor? This is a role playing game. What if I want to start a role playing a raider gang of high quality geared people? Why cant I be different than what is already made?
---
Yea the games pretty god and the communities great too
---
I'm of two minds about this.  But the new server mode may solve it.  
---
It'll be interesting to see if the "Raiders" move to the Survival server, where they'll face hardcore PVPers or if they chickenshit it out and stay with the pacifists and grief.  I think the latter.
---
I'm still waiting for that rare gating gun to actually be a rare and not change into a basic gatling gun.
---
Why are you commenting on a game if you haven't played it? If you haven't played it enough to understand how bounties work, you've got nothing to add here. They lose double whatever the player received. Also, to most caps are meaningless and easy to get, so it doesn't deter griefing, especially when you can have someone take the bounty off of you.
---
You don't need a shovel for treasure piles.
---
Nice i did say continuous a fat man isn‚Äôt really continuous or safe at the range of a TSE and you wanna carry those heavy expensive mini nukes. Try again 
---
Um, you could be the raider boss in F4 and be in full xo1... fact.
---
How hard could it be to make the number font in the level window smaller?  If the devs are not fixing the constant crashes and disconnects, which are caning the games' reputation, they sure as hell are not going to fix these cosmetic things. 
---
system? I need to check my inventory, I might have one, though mostly right legs I've been getting. Xbox
---
yeah, you'll be hard pressed to find class online
---
Ad Victoriam!
---
I will try that next time, see if it works. But in our case, none of us teamed up with anyone before (it‚Äôs just the two of us playing the game). But I‚Äôll definitely keep that in mind, thanks!
---
Idk if this is grieving or not, but my friend was pick-locking his way into someone‚Äôs extractors and he gotta bounty. The two lvl 60‚Äôs that owned the workshop roll up to take him out, a lvl 40, and me a lvl 33 (this was a while ago, I‚Äôm higher now). It puts me in combat with them once they shoot him, and for lvl 60‚Äôs they were really easy to kill. I could one shot them in PA and I got close to 1k caps until the server crashed. Kinda a douche move, but it was hilarious.
---
Because the damage is done in Adventure mode and everyone has tse. You can't take them away from ppl. In survival, no one will have them, an if they did have one, it will be on legitimate terms and they won't let anyone have it. 
---
I got a vampires Bowie knife and I think a vampires switch blade as well
---
I got them from defending the posiden plant workshop, granted I think I was under level 20 at the time.
---
Play on PC? 
---
Just happened to me, lost 536 .308 rounds
---
Also grinding in an action RPG is the opposite of good. When you get the "best" stuff, the game gets easier for you. Do play video games with cheat codes and pretend to be good at them too?
---
I'd rather have less immersion-breaking crashes and disconnects personally.
---
No, ps4
---
Interesting. I didn't figure that it was area-dependent. I found some rare-ish combat armor plans in the Toxic Wastes, IIRC.
---
Boo-hoo. It‚Äôs a video game. It‚Äôs part of the game. You are in post-apocalyptic times, man. 
---
wait till you trample the scorch queen for the 20th time. 
---
game was really fun until level 50 and i ran out of things to do. 
---
They're selling coasters in the Atom Shop now? ;D
---
Logic... 
---
Sidebar-&gt; BethesdaPlz
---
dressing for the part and roleplaying over mic like your a raider, properly ambushing and doing other raider things is proper roleplaying. Silently standing there in PA shooting someones house with an exploding shotgun and walking away isn't roleplaying
---
Sick burn.
---
I hope they keep improving the teaming up system.  It can be annoying when it doesn't send (and doesn't tell you it didn't either)
---
I've seen them drop 8 or 9 level 62 scorched and even do a lot of damage to a scorchbeast a few times. They do hit hard and accurately.
---
If someone played the game for 3 hours and made a negative post about it they would be absolutely crucified by this subreddit for forming an opinion so early on.
---
According to the lore of the raiders in in Appalachia at least they're the remnants of the rich elites who believed that everything was theirs and that anything anyone else had could be taken,  that the poor were their playthings.
---
Bethesda owns the rights to the game, they own the lore. It's not disrespectful to change fiction as you see fit. It's fiction. 1 and 2 were not my first, 3 was. 3 put fallout on the map, so as far as I'm concerned, Bethesda is allowed to rewrite lore however they see fit. I am however familiar with most of the lore, because I know how to google, hence why I posted a link to the gun runners history. Which again, history is hard to keep accurate since all we have are records and stories. It isn't outlandish at all to write in that Gun Runners have a connection to WV. It was basically a gang that got lucky while looking for turf and found a pre-war weapons manufacturing plant, they turned into the GR. Granted that doesn't technically happen for another 30 years, but Beth could easily write in a small group that starts up a pre-curser gun runners that eventually leads to the og one. When the nation can't communicate like it once could, you can't exactly state who was the first to do what and where. This game is a literal chance to retcon lore how they see fit, this is the closest we've ever been to the bombs falling save for the prologue of FO4.
---
You clearly are just too closed minded to be open to new experiences, which is why you wouldn't make it in the wasteland. You're precious lore is fiction, and fiction can be changed in any way the creators see fit. 
---
This is the single most important FO4 map.  If there is a way to give you caps/plans/legendaries or anything else you might need in game, it's yours.  Currently sitting on a stupid amount of plans and at least 1k plastic.
---
By the time I find other ingredients my main item spoils. I usually just make glowing meat and farm some normal cranberries for %5 exp buff (green thumb is recommended to farm those in bog)
---
Rashtag and ant steak for easy capacity boost. Everything else is just fancy for me. I still don't know how to make jams for example.
---
As long as we get the refund, otherwise keep harassing that Fire Dept, boys.
---
Its Amazon, look at the address your game connects to.
---
we found a guy who had 1000 plus bounty. once me and my chum finished him off he blocked us so we would not see him on the map. usually griefers dont like it when you can fight back so there blocking everyone on server.
---
I'm down w that. U mean, if I switched my toon over to survival, it would wipe my inventory and I start back at zero?. Shiiii, set the debt back to zero an let the chaos ensue. I thought about this but I thought I was the only one... That's what you're saying right? Lol
---
I'm just astounded people act so high and mighty when the sum total of their computer knowledge is Shift+Delete. (And probably not even that, wonder what the Recycle Bin looks like)
---
I‚Äôm actually not sure about shotgunning. Because there are 8 pellets per shot, I‚Äôm not exactly sure how it works with vats (ex. each pellet has a 95% chance to hit vs the entire Shell has a 95% chance to hit). I personally still use vats for melee because I use marsupial and bird bones so when I‚Äôm taking on hordes of enemies, I can avoid getting surrounded by jumping to avoid hits and then using vats midair to come back to the ground faster for a bit of a dps phase before the enemies refresh their melee and I repeat the process
---
Not sure if people expected some kind of extended endgame, since it's expected from online games.  All we have is "nuke whitesprings - pray to RNGesus".  The game could use some kind of faction rally, earn faction points to spend on faction exclusive gear, weapons, mods, etc.  Just hope Bethesda leaves raiding out though. After Destiny and FFXIV I'm getting far too old for raiding.  You can have a lucrative endgame without gating it behind difficult content a small percentage of people with 4-8+ free hours daily to beat.
---
I've stockpiled a bunch of ultracite that I just can't seem to burn down, mostly due to bottlenecking on the flux needed for ultracite ammo. Some of this I get off scorchbeasts, but most of it I pick up near fissure sites - there are generally 5-8 veins around a fissure. I think those veins get the same bonus as other mining veins if you're in an Excavator suit as well.
---
Because it takes surreal and ridiculous amount of time to reach more than 99, thats why it is not optimized for bigger number. After cruesome amount of time and focused grind, I hitted level 50.
---
Probably and no, ps4
---
U got downvoted for providing the correct answer I love this sub sometimes
---
Bro what‚Äôs your problem? I thought we were have a normal conversation, and not being a toxic little bitch. I know grinding an RPG doesn‚Äôt mean your good, I said at certain games, which you CLEARLY forgot to read before replying. I‚Äôve grinding CoD, Destiny, Halo and other Games. Do you also realize that‚Äôs how people are with football and other sports? People are competitive by nature. Don‚Äôt even reply I ain‚Äôt talking to your dumbass no more, I won‚Äôt even read it. Lol at you for being an absolute actual dumb fuck. 
---
Yeah, don't waste your time on this.  There's something wrong with the way doors attach with the Brick Building Set.  It annoys me too.
---
Just like the fact that the Dolly Sods workshop still doesn't list the resources it has on the map.
---
You totally play video games with cheat codes and pretend you're good at them.

Yep, I got promoted from private to general by killing wolves. 
---
"Raiders" are a part of the Fallout76 universe, but when they die the **DIE**. So very simple, make killing a passive or non-PVP player give people a Raider status instead of wanted, and when a Raider dies their character is erased.
---
Evey camp I see at the white springs golf club I level to the ground... I watch it burn the relentlessly  go after its owner till they kill me or leave the area. I straight spam none stop TSE combat  shotgun rounds  to the face...
---
Btw I "roll" play as a scotch beast, wish I could get a sonic gun...
---
I hope you didn't crash before you put your Pip Boy on, but anyways. Releasing the game in this state was a massive disrespect towards the players first hand. Secondly, if you get a disconnect or crash once or twice in an hour on a regular basis, not many people keep smiling and can say: "this is so fun". When they get the game more stable it's gonna brighten up players too.
---
If you're trying to build a homebrew xbox, you're also going to need the xbox operating system and game files. 
---
 Just go get a proper CPU/mobo and play the PC version. Not sure why you're trying to get the game to run properly on a potato.
---
Yes that percentage is a good number for the total players that have ever played 76, but does not reflect the players actually playing. Of active players its probably closer to 15% which is a good chunk and if they made PvP more accessible it would only grow from there. You have to always keep in mind that there are people that played 76 for 10 minutes and either hated it or had something better to do.   
---
Every player has to play PvE. If PvP was better it just gives all players another thing to do or another option. It's a good focus. There already is PvE content if you think its stale or not. I would like more too after my 100 hours played, but I'm not upset there isn't more since it did already give me that much.
---
Which one
---
I don't think so, but I hope they add it. I'd love my own eyebot.
---
Nice click bait katana lol
---
Yea. This soooooo much. 
---
I want a quest to pop up like Death From Above. Give me some insight on a call for help and I can decide if I want to go or not. 
---
Nah. We Raiders gon‚Äô Raid. 
---
Not everyone's negative but even after several rounds of good bug fixes, almost everything in the game has to be prefixed with 'usually'.  Usually when you fast travel, the game loads properly.  Usually you can see your team mates.  Usually when you wear clothes, you don't appear naked.    So much unusual / unintentional / bugged stuff happens that on voice we just say "this game......" every now and then and we all know it's done something completely random, AGAIN.
---
I don't like the giant shoulder pads either.
---
One last tip: if you're looking for red flora at the Whitespring, check the alley of dumpsters with all the skeletons.  Brain fungus makes red--er, "crimson" nuked flora.  East of that, between the road, there also plenty of silt beans and sap for blue.  Yellow and florescent should be obvious.  But yeah, there's like 20-30 brain fungus in that alley, so I don't even bother hunting for asters.
---
And if by some twist of fate you end up on the same server, my camp is pretty permanently south of the south wall of the golf course with a full set of benches, parked on the junk pile.
---
Cheers!
---
So again the problems of this are twofold. Bethesda would end up with two versions of the game to try and fix, and it'd only be a matter of time before the endgame of survival devolves back into people one-shotting each other with TSEs.  
---
The end problem is not haves and have-nots, it's that the weapon balance for PvP is broken to begin with.
---
Ha! Sure, I need a group to join. Do you work with the guy who made this post?
---
You know people can read your post history, right? Trying to ride the karma train or is Bethesda paying you?
---
I roleplay as an evil responder. I help people by ending their suffering . /s
---
Other than 100/100 Fusion Cores, yeah, workshops could use a buff. Scavenging is a lot more rewarding most of the time.
---
People mad about griefers, this pleases me
---
I was minding my own business before when someone came and started destroying my base with nades. I ignored him but he continued so I killed him. Thinking that would be the end of it. Minute later two other people show up and all 3 just destroy my base, a lv 100+ shows up with an explosive gun and 1 hits me if I try to fight back.
---
Thank God for world swapping.

I love opossums for one simple reason: they are one of the few creatures that will happily hunt for ticks and EAT THEM. For that reason, opossums are cool. Because fuck ticks.

It might only be for workshops then

In my experience, the cloaking doesn't last any longer regardless of getting hit again during the cloak mode OR by how many pieces you have on. You'd have to get hit again for it to proc once more an so on. I think I heard someone say that multiple chameleon pieces makes you less noticeable but I'm gonna bet it's a small difference if anything. Ultimately, if u wanna be sneaky, I'd suggest agility perks. There's one that let's u crouch and escape from battle. I'm gonna bet that the combination of the two would be pretty good.
---
Imo, having one piece of invisibility would suffice. I personally have one of each. I'm agility build and I use those perks I spoke of and I'm pretty legit. Melee is a viable course of action. I wish you luck
---
It's been nearly 30 years since the bombs dropped. Only vault residents and other selected individuals got protection. The rest of the world was left outside to fend for itself, what was left banded together wherever they could. You dont think 25 years is enough time to establish new factions? Raiders were established withing days to weeks. The BoS was basically established when the bombs fell by former military who we knew the truth of the corrupted govt. The enclave existed long before the great war. The responders, and free states are new factions. The free states seceded from the nation before the great war, the responders established after. Idk where the lazy writing is
---
You don't seem to understand if the number of players remain the same, the amount of resources dedicated to running the world instances remain the same so there is no real cost increase...one extra world instance isn't going to make an appreciable difference, besides if you haven't noticed when instance populations get low, they shut down the instance to force consolidation into others.  Ever get that maintenance in 5 minutes warning out of the blue?   What do you think is going on there?
---
Same. It got so bad for me back when I played World of Warcraft that I joined an all female guild, which helped a lot in at least having somewhere to talk about it.
---
I have quit a lot of online games, and really only stuck with single player (mostly the 3d Fallouts). All the guys I knew would be playing multiplayer games but I just couldn't get into them because everyone was really toxic and gross. 
---
And it would rub off on people. One of my guy friends wasn't a huge dick, but once he started playing some multiplayer shooters you would just see his whole personality change, teabagging things and calling everyone names. 
---
I have had the whole "I was nice to you, we're dating now" thing happen, too. Ha! Anyone who tries that is going to be pretty disappointed.
---
Oh as well, don't forget that you don't have to click on surival mode. I don't think that's what they should make right this second, but I can't wait for it and I know they won't require as many servers and still probably won't have full players all the time.
---
IRL i've only 1 friend who played survival mode, me and him were the best at the game at my friends . he could beat the game on survival while being pacifist, we could both go around killin everything, but we both looked at each other thinking you guys have no idea what you doing when we watched others, but we all had fun.
---
"Continuous" is not synonymous with "large magazine rapid fire weapon". A weapon variant doing high damage NOW does not mean Bethesda cannot PATCH IT to bring it's performance in line. Seriously dude almost everything you've said has been conjecture, you don't and can't know what Bethesda will or won't do with these weapons.
---
Hey. As long as I‚Äôm not getting TSE‚Äôd constantly, I‚Äôm fine. I rp as a Raider but I don‚Äôt have any OP weapons. I just have a Mutated Melee build and hope that Survival will be fun. 
---
Protest March and The Messenger, two of the glitchiest events we‚Äôve got, so naturally those are the ones that spawn all the time.

The interior door frame is even worse. I had to use the exterior frame for all of my doors because of it.

Oh boi. Its sad, but afaik they usually dont.

When I purchased 76, my launcher, which I already had installed long before the purchase wouldnt acknowledge that I now own 76, not even after a redownload and reinstall. I submitted a ticket and got the same kind of generic response, formed as if I was an idiot, most likely not even rewieved manually.  
---
BGS really dont look like they give a fuck about anything except money. The launcher is glitchy, the game is as well. And what do we get instead of an immidiate update that would fix duping, access to the dev room, broken camps and milion other things that are ruining our fallout? A new Pricess Castle Bed available for purchase.  
---
Based on my experience, I imagine you are really pissed rn, so I wont be adding any more oil to the fire. Taking a nap would help me, but I guess you know your medicine better. I dont know how big of an issue this is for you, but  forgetting about the game and maybe coming back later in time sounds like a reasonable idea. As a big Fallout fan, I know its not easy and I feel sorry for you. I hope your issue will eventually be resolved :)
---
This is so well put together that I have to give it thumbs up.  I have been using the character builder for my latest toon.  Your work is much appreciated.  I actually didn't know that deathclaw wellington gives +3 str.  I probably will start picking up pepper when I see it now. 
---
With that said...food/water management is one of my least favorite things to do.  I am glad the struggle is there, because it adds to immersion, but I dont enjoy it particularly.  I basically just quest or farm and pick up meat along the way, whatever is in my inventory when I make it back to camp is what I cook, and whatever water is in the purifier is what goes with me. 
---
A griefer is by definition someone trying to cause other players emotional anguish. It's quite similar to being a troll. So yea, someone who is griefing is also by definition being a troll and an asshole and it has nothing to do with RPing. 
---
HOWEVER. Just because someone does something that causes another person to get emotional, doesn't mean they're a griefer or a troll or asshole. It's all in the intent and in-character/out-of-character balance. If they're PVPing and happen to come across your camp and attack you and your base and your crops, that is not inherently a mean thing. It's part of the game. 
---
The difference is therefore usually observable in the degree to which a player commits to hostile actions, and whether or not they pay attention to how their 'victim' is responding. If you're running around PVPing people there's nothing wrong with that; if they ask you to stop and you don't, there's still technically nothing wrong with that, as asking someone else to stop doing what they enjoy doing within the game design is a little unfair; but if they sound legitimately upset and you keep on doing the thing even though you gain little or nothing from it, or if you're specifically interested in getting that emotional response out of them, then yes, I'd say you're being a griefer and a troll.
---
It's a fine line. I think non-PVPers need to do what they can to leave/avoid a PVP situation, including potentially jumping servers if need be. There has to be respect for PVPers. But PVPers also need to understand that taking any kind of enjoyment from another person's OOC anguish is a dick move. And if you're a low empathy PVPer you might want to find a more competitive game that's based around PVP itself, rather than a casualish PVE-focused game like 76. Like if you're shooting up some kid's base and they're clearly upset then yea, you're just a scummy human being.
---
That's how I see it anyway.
---
I had a level 200 come and level my fucking base last night and murder me a few times
---
Lol

Wow. Who hurt you?

One thing GTA:O did well was if you just destroyed someone's stuff, you had to pay an insurance deductible.

This looks great, nice job!
---
Dude I posted this two months ago... on a subreddit specifically for this game...
---
Why are you here and why do you care? Just go play a game you actually like.
---
Griefers yeah.. 
---
Yeah because everyone who plays the game gets bounties or hunts bounties. Because I haven't tried to exploit the bounty system with friends, and I don't find it fun killing people from a position of virtual invulnerability, nor do I find it fun trashing peoples CAMPS. So yeah. I've got plenty to add here. A lot more than you and your shill assholes.
---
Thanks! I took like five pictures with different filters and liked the black and white the most!

Never seen any of that.

Tell him to try a few hours with a different PA helmet, let me know if it helps, trying to beat the dead horse

ooo ok interesting take, I rarely use VATs for melee, only to close the gap so may try use it more. do the luck perks have to be v.a.t.s perks or just luck?

Just finally got around to trying, and already hit a snag right off the bat. Flat roofs won't snap to defensive stairs for me.
---
A couple of plants and a purifier puts me over budget otherwise I'd buy one too.
---
I really think griefing is just an excuse for people to act like assholes, but a player that has captured a workshop has agreed to participate in PvP. Orbital strikes, 2-on-1, Mini-Nukes, kiting a scorchbeast into the workshop - all fair &amp; square. As long as they are not resulting to dupped weapons and booblehead stacking 
---
A .50 would do more damage than a .308 though, have you seen the size difference....
---
I had this after the last update. Game was fine at BETA and release. No crashes.   
---
Then after last update it started crashing occasionally, which progressed to constant crashing.   
---
I uninstalled, reinstalled, and then updated. Game worked perfect for 3-4 hours until I went into Whitesprings blast zone. Back to constant crashing.   
---
Only game which causes me a problem. And only on one profile.   
---
Does anyone else miss not being able to decorate your house with stuff you collect to give it character? I loved that aspect of Fallout 4.

I'd say that, yes, the one that comes up the most for me is the desire for an "LOL" emote.

Yeah, that's what I thought, but nope. Here's to looking forward to the update where they nurf my gun

Just like President Eden in fo3!
---
I don't even care about realism, we threw that out the window a long time ago. I just want something that fits the fallout universe. What about the pint sized slasher outfit? It would fit this "toy" theme they decided on this month, plus it's a classic from F3. Not to mention the faschnacht man mask was a very popular item before it became public knowledge where to get one. Those are two genuine reasons to believe players would like that. As for the princess bed? I feel like at least half the purchases will be as a joke instead of actually wanting it
---
Im pretty sure raider bosses with power armor all wear raider power armor in fallout 4, with the exception of Ivey in her custom tesla armor.
---
Not taking sides here, but stating that fallout 4 raiders wear any kind of power armor is just a lie.
---
Stop opening your pipboy until fully loaded
---
Everything you‚Äôve said is sounds like whinnying from the original post. A fat man should have great damage. I was sure you‚Äôd use your sense to know what class of weapons we were talking about. You were trying to be sarcastic using a one shot heavy to compare with a TSE. Wow just WOW!
---
I will say, I have quite a few friends grinding challenges for it.
---
I'd like to see more junk that can be bulked. Its a pet peeve of mine that gold and silver both sells for 2caps per piece at most. At least bulking would bring out the difference in value somewhat. 
---
Yeah that's a big problem
---
Most of what I have stashed is 1* Armor and a 2* AA Tambo I'm just waiting to sell to vendors.  What in particular are you looking for?  Interested in the switchblade.
---
You guys. This is satire.
---
Let me start with the fact that I dont like pvp, I'm terrible at pvp, and it annoys me when I'm dragged into pvp. However, it is part of the game. With no actual "raiders" the players become the raiders. Plus, why not role play as a raider? Losing junk is annoying, but replaceable. You dont lose levels, experience, weapons, armor, aid, etc... Losing caps is annoying, but its not that hard to get more. As far as base destroying, while annoying, it's easy to repair.
---
None of that is griefing.
---
I have a rank 1 and a rank 2 card, I switch them out depending on other perks I need equipped. I haven't noticed a real difference between the two.
---
Why are you even here then? To intentionally annoy yourself by reading through posts about a game you don't even like?
---

I can sell bulk springs (10springs) for 20 caps each to a vendor, so 8 bulk (80 springs) = 160 caps.

the princess castle bed was literally in the first wave of datamining

it has been in the game files before the game came out of beta

they have had these weekly atom shop themes planned out literally months in advance

The game would probably implode if you added a few more squirrel spawns
---
Its better to change server if your camp is being trashed 
---
Thank you for the advice.
---
2. Getting rads. It's handy in nuke zones.
---
4. Energy weapons are weak and uncommon, so high ballistic may work out. I'd chuck on a bit of heavy leather to balance personally. I like to have \~50 rad resist too, but some people think it's a waste. For Scorchbeasts you want to buff the hidden explosion resistance with Padded or Dense torso mods.
---
No you right, I would of been pissed .. I had a friend threatening to do this and told him off, never mind a random. You did all the work and this little dickbag launches on nuke off your hard work .. I would of been fuming rightly so.
---
Could you see him on the map, he might have blocked you, so you didn't see him coming, get you to do all the work .. I bet people do this,
---
Highly reminiscent of that frame from the opening of Fallout 4, very cool
---
Funny. You're using a throwaway account to compliment the game? You literally have no other activity than posting this and making comments here. Nice try Bethesda
---
Yeah. They rushed through to the obvious "endgame". They still believe that seeing bigger numbers on the screen means they are winning the game. Don't worry about them too much. /r/fo76FilthyCasuals
---
Lazy coding is why...
---
Could I please buy the x-01. My PSN is dtb7591
---
It's hard to agree with you without specifics.
---
First off; grieving is the intentional harassment of a player or group of players. Griefers usually find a target and will constantly attempt to kill/block the player from progressing.
---
Considering you can server hop and block people; I would say that griefing is non existent in this game. (if you are being griefed and refused to leave that's really on you.)
---
I play a lot of games, and a lot of people seem to define as "he killed me" or "he camped outside the high value item zones and told me to give him some of my supplies or he'd kill me."
---
I've had people walk into my workshops, try to take my shit, get killed by me and then they proceed to call me a griefer. 
---
people killing you, attacking your base or workshop, and taking your supplies is not griefing. 
---
They're the kind of people who would have played Kinder in D&amp;D.
---
They can be purchased from the robot vendors @ top of the world
---
'repeating quests'... Not again...  "i got something different for you,  got word from another settlement that needs our help. I'll mark it on your map.". 
---
Looks great. Not much use for my character who subsists solely on dog food and booze. And the occasional Nuka Cola for those tasty radioactive isotopes and asbestos.
---
They should have it, as soon as you go past a certain checkpoint, no one else can enter that isn't on your team or certainly can't enter the nuke code or target.
---
Also next time don't put in a card if someone is around, let him waste his if you is going to pull a fast one.
---
Its all a scam. They promised a wall but you'll get nothing :D
---
Meanwhile at BGS: the outcasts *actually* got low key founded by this random dead guy here's his final words and paint scheme and yup, you thought wronggg
---
I've also yet to find a decent rifle. I'd like to have one as a backup for when melee doesn't fit. How much would you like for the furious handmade?
---
Don't be mad because Bethesda made a perk card that makes it easier for you to get butt hurt. 
---
There are rumors of a Bioshock 4 in development. Lets hope!!
---
There's a line between the two. I've had my camp wrecked, I was pissed and bitched, but ultimately accepted that's the part of the game. In fact it got to the point I stopped repairing my camp because I liked the idea of it being a ransacked structure that I eventually took over. I have a bigger issue with the two shot explosive type making it hard to get decent loot and XP. 
---
I'll say not really. I played today for the first time in about two or three weeks and struggled with what to do. I did realize my two-shot handmade is also explosive, so that's cool.
---
I think if u have settlers in your camp.. It will be an orgasm for griefers tbh
---
Grafton vendor (either of them) has them. I think all of the robot vendors do.
---
Yes I‚Äôll be doing 2 more but they‚Äôll be throughout the day. Next will probably be between 5-6 central time and the last will be between 8-9 central
---
Also if you on XB1, make sure you block him and report him so he never does this again. At least permanently block him so he can't see you in the silo
---
Lol, actually I've only had one person attack my camp over the past 3 months of play, and only a handful keep shooting me after I ignore them at first. 
---
It's easy to claim someone is role-playing as a raider when there is no consequences, but that's the same reason the people that claim they want to PvP everyone don't use the hunter/hunted channel, or go capture a workshop and defend it against others. It's easier and less risky to one-shot someone from behind or chase down a fleeing passive player.
---
I agree for the most part. The BOS still is a very controversial addition to the game. Bethesda has written them into the game properly so that it at least kinda makes sense.
---
Are you on pc ? Iv found a few of these if you add me ign Andychal11 il happily send you one next time I come across one 
---
That and the lever is way more versatile when the mag is empty and you need to reload. Can‚Äôt put one round in the hunting rifle to get that last shot off for a kill.
---
I don't like getting griefed and I never griefed in any game, but being a griefer because of roleplaying is ok imo
---
Hmm i only have the hat. 
---
Xbox, thank you though.
---
I mean, could just make them bootleg Nuka Colas that use cork tops instead.
---
just fast travel to camp mcclintock, the place is full of battered clipboards!!
---
Wow, it's almost like it's a survival game! You know, like rust and every other, where you are one of the only survivors?
---
Or what if a group of people wanted to wear combat armor and have a paramilitaristc worldview, going out and taking what they want and leaving nothing but death and devastation in their wake? What would you call them?
---
Oh yeah, Gunners.
---
I‚Äôm a raider. I like killing everyone and stealing their loot and destroying people‚Äôs bases. I have no caps and don‚Äôt care - there‚Äôs no other end game content for me besides pillaging and raping as a raider. 
---
Try 4th floor ft defiance, kitchen has plates and utensils and the pool table has pool balls. 
---
I agree with character creation. I'm Asian, it's very hard to make the character look Asian.
---
Because, dude? It doesn't. Everyone is dead. We never hear about the region in other games. Even the raiders are dead. 
---
Forgive me for finding arguing with a brick wall tiresome. From my understanding, your only point this entire time has been "TSE will always be broken (as long as Two-shot and Explosive are paired)" when you don't have a shred of evidence to support this. Bethesda could do anything with the variants, they could reduce the damage of the second shot to 1% and the radius of the explosion to 0.0001mm for all we know. Your criticisms have been nothing but pure speculation, that Bethesda will screw it up somehow. It's not constructive.
---
There is really only 2 things I consider actually griefing. Killing someone with slap damage, usually with duped bobbleheads, or having a friend clear wanted status right after earning it. If you wreck someone's base and earn that wanted status that's fine you should be ready to defend yourself as people try and claim the bounty.
---
Lol I met a clingy dude too while playing the game. He came across my C.A.M.P and was complimenting me on it, then I helped him do some powering up power plant events. You know, just having fun playing the game. Then he started sending me a ton of messages about everything like how's the weather and and shit. Then he got butt hurt when I wasn't responding enough apparently and said oh sorry for bothering you, you didn't have to add me as a friend so I've just ignored him since.
---
I recently found the joy of how far the range of an artillery is.  I'm set up at the titanium resource east of harpers ferry and those strikes reach the heart of city. Might take some testing to place a camp far enough to still spawn if a player sets their base by the golf course and yet close enough to be within range of an artillery bombardment.
---
Probably coming with Factions content that has been pushed back for game fixes.
---
99 percent of the Atonic shop items so far have been in the game files at least in text form since release. Most of it was likely pre planned and pre scheduled. You know how the messages at login are now important yelling us about rad toys and night regen? This isnt new. This was planned from the start. Remember the weird deathclaw island one near Christmas? Cut content event for the holidays more than likely. Theres even scripting for login sort of lootboxes for Christmas and such.
---
They get time gated microtransaction content pre-set up so development can focus on release woes and getting established. 
---
For the time being, I imagine the ATOM shop is still largely in it's own BETA. They're releasing what they had ready to go, then they'll look at sales metrics and interests for developing content further.
---
Not saying dont feel let down if you see something meh. Just saying don't blame each individual release as a separate slight. Honestly it's been on auto pilot for ages.
---
If youre on ps4 im selling the BOS legs for 500 caps
---
It would be nice to have the option to just turn the animations off in the options.
---
If you‚Äôre a rifle guy, tank killer.
---
While Fortnite and GTA Online make billions. I can't even find anything to spend free atoms on.
---
Bookmarking map locations is a simple client-side QOL addition they could make. Is there not a mod for it?
---
Like this reply?
---
Yeah, I just found a pipboy game that instead of playing, locked my character up, needing to back out to main menu to fix, which of course chucks me out of where I was, without giving me back any ammo, obviously, so I need to re-clear the area and recollect the quest items, assuming I can, given I can't complete "An Ounce Of Prevention" because it won't let me collect Feral Ghoul blood, so I have Wolf blood and Mole Rat and cannot complete the quest...
---
Game is buggy AF. I enjoy it on many levels, and should they do a good deal of work it could absolutely be one of those games that lasts for a core group, but saying it's "playable with a few bugs" is disingenuous.
---
He either left the server so you couldn't seek revenge, or he spent the rest of his time crouching.
---
I found the hat, but I've been trying to find the dress and apparently it's just, no where to be found lol
---
can you explain what you try to ask us? because i have no idea what you want ...
---
I would like to tag along but atm I aint home 
---
Hit level 75, today (looking forward to 76!)
---
Hate the disconnections and the crashes.  I get one of each a day maybe?  
---
Otherwise, 150 hours in and love it.  YMMV.  
---
Yeah. You are lucky that‚Äôs all it took. People remake this post on the daily and sometimes it eats all your gear or say, your entire stock of ammunition. 
---
Beware the Feed the People Event.
---
Yes, Bethesda owns the lore and they can do whatever they want but the question is: Should they? Even if they explain it properly it would just stir another controversy. Bethesda had enough already. They don't have to use the Gun Runners for the kind of DLC you suggested. I would like it more if they add a new faction or improve the factions that already exist in 76 instead of unnecessarily retconning an already existing one into the game.
---
Obviously they have to be disgusting psychopaths.  
---
Always happening to me
---
What does the artillery even do never used it
---
You hit way too close to the truth
---
They fixed that, but now every time I use one it uses the Gatling Laser projectile and sound effects. 
---
I have a shadowed cultists dagger...
---
I have had it since day one of beta and it‚Äôs more to remind me that it can exist... because it‚Äôs the first and last modified one I‚Äôve seen.
---
*Shit game, 0/10, would not recommend.*  
---
No.  I'm with you, OP.
---
Nowadays I log in to Harper's ferry, kill whatever's there, sell weapons for cash up to the daily limit, notice the calibrated shocks aren't there, and log off. I'm level 77, and prior to this I would go between watoga, harpers, and white springs looking for various calibrated shocks. And prior to that I kept logging in at white springs to check vendors and occasionally participate in a nuke clearing.
---
Seriously wondering how people can tolerate playing more when I with my word schedule barely playing have run out of meaningful things to do.
---
Honestly if the cap limit for sales were larger I'd play longer running around Harper's ferry but the repawn is too slow even for that.
---
Wish there were more quests to do.
---
So I went ahead and bought the ESO Elsweyr standard edition to add morrowind and summerset to whatever I already had and started a Warden. 
---
The Enclave Plasma Guns have the same problem, they use the same textures as the standard plasma weapons despite having their own. Just one of the many signs that 76 was rushed to market. 
---
Happens all the time. You have to wait a bit to open it up. Never happened before last patch though. 
---
Let me guess, you put your pip boy and you were disconnected from the server?
---
Pacifist mode only keeps you from damaging other players, you can still get killed by them
---
There's a couple apps that have fallout 76 maps and you can make your own with notes
---
Where do Ash Roses grow? I need them for tea. More plants than just that, but specifically that one
---
Yes but I am a console player
---
Ev'rybody in the house say....
---
That‚Äôs what happens when you use large windows, place benches or objects that ‚Äúsit‚Äù too close to walls or windows.
---
There are owlets in game... never seen one but they exist.
---
Wait. What i need to paste in Medium.ini?
---
Settings from OP post or from your?
---
sure, but are you constantly reminded everyone and everything is dead in those games?  like are there dead bodies littered every-fucking-where?  does every holotape you listen to end in tragedy?  this game is incredibly heavy, it is depressing as fuck...  not to mention Fallout games in the past have been filled with irreverent humor, and that is completely lacking in this heavy, depressing game...
---
PC, i get my full 60 fps at the queen fight, the one thing everyone complains about ...
---
Got a AMD Ryzen 7 2700x with a GTX 2080 and 16 gb ram.
---
Bro don't you know that in a real post apocalyptic world everyone would be passing out candy and bubblegum while literally nothing bad would ever happen? 
---
Because smashing a camp is an easy way to get a bounty. You can then just use it to lure people in and when they try to claim the bounty you kill them for their caps instead. Ive gotten almost 10k caps this way.
---
Hello fellow ARK survivor! Yes a fridge would be an obvious addition with separate storage for food you would think.
---
If you have a workshop I want and you dont want to be killed and have your stuff stolen then maybe just dont claim it... its really just that simple
---
The dry bed south of the Summersville bridge area spawns cats and chickens.  Also beavers and frogs.  Used to have my CAMP there.
---
Perfect for those times when you want to visit your friend who lives underground 
---
If the game survives the category 5 internet s\*\*\*storm it's currently suffering, I'm sure they'll show up in the ATOM Shop at some point. 
---
I think theres one or two in the trailers in flatwoods
---
Bloody mess is flat 15% damage, but tank killer has penetration, and penetration is super good. If you're going to be doing pvp penetration will prob be the new meta considering the tse nerf. It's really all dependent on your build. 
---
I think shotgun stays in Strength, but otherwise great topic.
---
Idk, a hardcore mode sounds awesome. I'm sure they'll think of a way to balance it out. There will always be someone with all the top tier equipment eventually and there will always be someone selling that stuff on ebay. Grief will still exist but I'll at least have a team w me to esplode the dude that greased me. We won't be one on one slap to duel situation. It'll be some one or a group that makes a bad decision to mess w me when my team appears from nowhere an lets the bullets fly. Besides, I won't be on a map anymore, I'll be hard to find unless you come across me accidentally in the field and also I'll try n obtain armor that makes me harder to see. I'll have a whole new element, surprise. Don't wander alone an it'll be fine. I bet they'll drop new legendary armor attributes soon too. This is fixable. If ppl are dropping out of the game over this then they are gonna miss out. I think the idea is ; start the adventure first, get acquainted w the map, find your play style, make some friends, start a new survival toon, meet up w your friends to make a team, fight off the grief, build yourself asap, get yourself legendary, grief/protect, repeat. 
---
I wished they added a Princess Outfit...
---
You can't see him because he's not there anymore.
---
Total BS - lol
---
Not unless another player kills you. Come to think of it, a "Bounty Vendor Bot" or something like it would be a nice QoL addition. 
---
It's happening on all of them in my camp. :(
---
Your comment are damned to save the pair regardless of the effects it could affect every other mechanic in the game. 
---
Are you looking for the power armor or the mods ?
---
They still can though, they can do both. Theres no reason no to either. I like you're idea too, but I also love the gun runners and want to see their weapons in game. That doesnt mean your idea cant happen as well.  New weapons and gear will always be something to add at certain points. Hell, they could do an original one first and then time jump our game to keep the lore set for the second one. Beth has a game so early in the timeline that they can pretty much write in anything and connect the dots down the line. 
---
They set up turrets and kill stuff that they don‚Äôt get exp for and cannot loot since they didn‚Äôt shoot it personally.  It basically just keeps troops from spawning for no reason. 
---
Swarm of suitors flakes on me too. Go to the island.... aaaaaaaaand nothing. 
---
I'm aware of what pacifist mode is supposed to do. It's just that I turned it off so I can fight back but neither of us was doing anything to each other. Only my turrets did damage and they were allowed to destroy anything I built
---
All over the Ash Heap region. People say the roofs of Lewisburg are the best location to farm them.
---
I can make you one. I can be on in a little bit, if you don‚Äôt mind waiting a few hours
---
Similar to an orbital strike if it‚Äôs anything like it was in FO4. Just bombards an area you Mark with a grenade 
---
I read that they patched the duping of items. I'm really into trading so that patch is good. That handmade should increase in value.
---
Got my first at level 96. 
---
I went thru my stash the other day and realized I had 2 explosive weapons I never knew about. Not two shot but I never looked at what the second star on them was for. I drop legendaries all the time and now wonder what I may have thrown out. 
---
I role play a good Raider who kills evil Responders. Not sarcasm.
---
The real question here is what hand held weapon weighs 43 pounds??? If I had to run around the Marine Corps with a 43 pound gun I would probably just give up.
---
If you have to choose I‚Äôd say tank killer. Both together is really solid though.
---
I would like it to keep track of plants.  Like the plants that contain digested goo, I can never find them when I‚Äôm wondering the Bog.
---
Guy-Man, Thomas, and Hermano.
---
I moderately liked the crayola looking shit. I got the toy box. Not 100% sold on the power armor. Girly is fine and all but if I'm in PA I'm gonna look like a murder machine dammit. Unless they give us pink PA... Murder machine be damned that's gonna be adorable. 
---
It's a minor glitch but I hate the graphics they used on notes, especially when some seem to clip part of the text off on the left side. 
---
1 month on reddit, invalidating others' opinions, 50-50 upvoted, seems like a great community.
---
Why does it have to be gunners? Why cant I create my own brand? That's the point I'm trying to make. Why try and do something and then instantly be labeled as something that already exists and immediately having to conform to their standards
---
You need to mention what you play on, otherwise people wont know.
---
I thought you can get one at the pumpkin house at the top of the divide?
---
And tomorrow Yellowstone park **could** explode and bury Bethesda in volcanic ash.  
---
For the final time, wild, baseless speculation is completely unproductive and I'm done with this chain.
---
Yup. Just took my Jet Pack T-60 30 minutes ago. That must be one mighty food processor to mulch anti-tank armor. It almost took my handmade rifle too.
---
Both legs?
---
Sometimes I think we're talking to a brick wall called bethesda.
---
Why on earth did they think that we wanted an pvp survival mode?
---
All good feedback come from the fact that people in the game were being friendly and cooperative. People were actually helping each other by giving access to their camps, giving away guns, chems and ammo to strangers. Escorting low levels through difficult locations or giving them better stuff. 
---
And what betheda does? Encourages people to get into hardcore pvp. 
---
A great amount of players are already without any activities to do. They should have focus on keeping a fast pace of game fixing patches and in also starting the add new content to the game.
---
Off topic, but if all I drink is purified water and eat cooked radstag/brahmin, is lead belly redundant? 
---
Well its the plan so yea, theres only bos arms, legs and chest. Also they do more than paint, its the best mod for combat armor atm
---
Hold it and tell it you didn‚Äôt mean all the shit talking you did. üòÇ
---
We can't be grimy and bougie
---
It's always a blast to dismantle an entire floor to change a staircase or put in a different door.
---
The game rewards new solo players with the longer experience, they gain exp slower since they can't simply show up to an area and wreck it no matter what level the enemies are. There are legit consequences to all actions and most of the endgame content is more of journey to get to. You don't have friends to rely on, and if you avoid all other players, it's just like old Fallout.
---
It really feels like it's carried by the map, and the still new feeling of player interaction in a Bethesda game. Within minutes of gameplay if you have played fallout 4, hell fallout 3 even, you can clearly see the AI is completely fucked. And let's not even dig in to the technical issues
---
I have no problem finding plastic, just walking from location to location picking up a little at a time, I stay well over 100.
---
so, a journal?
---
they're random, so look where you find magazines
---
Outside room 237?
---
Yes sort of but more like location markers you can place down and write notes that would stay on your map until you delete them.
---
I got mine from Flatwoods vendor.
---
I‚Äôve never used lead belly and have no issues with just popping a Radaway, they‚Äôre easy to find and they‚Äôre heavy (at least until the next patch) so you‚Äôll want an outlet for your excess anyway. 
---
You‚Äôre better off using those endurance points for fireproof.
---
Strength effects stack, it won't if you're in power armor though.
---
pus
---
I'd like to see everything bulkable for organization purposes not just selling.  I dont often remember what bulks and what doesnt and my list of supplies is not in any logical alphabetical order. 
---
Bulk cork
---
Fiberglass spool
---
Waste acid
---
I know it's more of an OCD issue but it's still frustrating. 
---
With all due respect and remember I'm saying with all due respect.
---
The Fallout Dust, Frost, and New California mods are all a better and more complete games than FA76.  And those are made in a cave with a bunch of scraps.
---
If an event was going on, such as defending the workshop, you cant pvp 
---
The funny thing is, this is the one lore-accurate change they've made in 76. The whole reason energy weapons are rare in the later-set games is that they don't last as long as conventional firearms and are harder to maintain. Drop an assault rifle on the ground, you have a dented assault rifle. Drop a laser on the ground, you have a giant flashlight. 
---
That said, I think they've gone overboard. They either need to massively increase energy weapons' damage output, or slightly less drastically increase their durability. Right now, a lever action rifle lasts five times as long as a plasma rifle and out-performs it in DPS. No one other than RPers like me would want to use energy weapons as it stands.
---
Might as well. I'm on right now if you are?
---
I have 6 (3* fire proof / 3* lead belly)
---
Was thinking of ridding lead belly, which I really only needed when I ran carnivore and putting those 3 into luck for bloody mess
---
Your post and the comments belowa re the reason I dont understand why is bethesda adding a survival pvp mode... 
---
Bruh... I found a lever that does 25% less ap cost..... That + gun-fu + reaper's sprint... Dude, I walk into town like. *quietly the wind blows * queue tumble weed *.
---
POW! Click click. POW! Click click. POW! 
---
nothing new. still waiting
---
God damn it, I just want to buy walls. Is that so much to ask? Like 8 floor options but no goddamn walls
---
I think that was sort of the point of the original game devs. 
---
This sub is one of the more bitter ones, get used to the hate. I personally love the game
---
I checked there numerous times with no sign of it. Maybe I just missed it. 
---
Everything at this point is speculation your points and mine. What you don‚Äôt seem to take account for is chain reaction that one of your solutions presents. I don‚Äôt hate Bethesda in fact I‚Äôm a huge fan and love the game however I‚Äôm not blind and see what is, what was, and with that give a hypothesis of what might be. The easiest fix without changing mechanics is to remove the pair. At least from a mode that has such penalties for dying as losing aid or ‚Äúother things‚Äù as the inside the vault said.
---
I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs a good trade off. The damage will be worth more than the rad reduction. You could run good doggy and just eat dog food as well. But those 3 points will serve you better as bloody mess.
---
They have plans for it!?!?
---
It looks like one of those aliens from nuka world
---
"Locked your character up"? What's that even mean? I've played every pip boy game in the game without issue, so I'm not sure why you would have an issue.
---
The game has been perfectly playable with a few bugs, I'm sorry your experience hasn't been as good, but that doesn't change mine. Also, every single person I've played with on PS4 has told me they feel about the same. Occasional crashes and frame rate issues, but otherwise no major issues for over a month.
---
Sure, add me BirdJP19 and join in on me I cant fast travel at the moment 
---
Just restart the game. Bad sync with the server. 
---
It's not a bug, it's a feature.
---
[Cool, cool](https://youtu.be/Kd-Sa_3iBVA) 
---
Agreed. I'm an Enclave officer. The whole damn point of those silos was to win the war, to keep fighting after the initial salvos were exchanged. Let me do my duty! 
---
It's a Zetan, Flatwoods Monster.
---
Once you've killed the monster you can see the same head under its helmet. Not sure about the one you've found though there are a few references to them and sighting's of them though scattered around the game.
---
I‚Äôll keep an eye out for it.  I‚Äôm guessing you tried the costume shop too.
---
I‚Äôll craft regular same type deep-pocketed armor when I get home to make sure, but ty for the help!
---
Hey that‚Äôs cool! About the list of foods, the official guide has all of them along with their required ingredients. I‚Äôm sure that will help move things along fir you!
---
Because most of the reviews came when the game was buggy as shit.
---
It still is, just less so.
---
Hey nice! Just in time for the Half-Shot nerf too. üéàüéâ
---
You're doing gods work, General
---
Poser.
---
In my opinion, vats perks are the most bang for your buck when you have extra points available because there are a lot of options for vats and criticals. Because you are in power armor, you don‚Äôt have to dedicate a lot of points into DR and ER perks so you can maximize your average damage via more critical damage and having crits more often. My suggestion for this type of build would be 3* critical savvy and 3* better criticals. 
---
Another suggestion is with Thru Hiker. It‚Äôs nice to have but it‚Äôs redundant if you‚Äôre using Cannibal and Lead Belly. So I would pick one or the other. Go with Cannibal and Lead Belly if you‚Äôre not too great with scavenging. But also I don‚Äôt think you can use cannibal inside power armor so keep that in mind. I personally just pick up food as I need it but I‚Äôm just super focused on keeping my hunger and thirst meters maxed for the extra bonuses. Last, you don‚Äôt need 3* gun fu unless you‚Äôre planning on using vats heavily. Having 1* gun fu is a nice convenience (though flawed because sometimes your next target is a friendly) but 3* is a waste.
---
I'd be down - hovdogjay
---
what, you don't like this endless deluge of "just got this game 2 hours ago and i'm already level 6 and having so much fun!!! don't believe the internet!!!!!!!" and "unpopular opinion: this game is actually good, DAE like it???" and "i met another human being and we shot stuff together! GAME OF THE FOREVER!"  while actually useful information, constructive discussion, and real content gets washed away?
---
Nothing in particular I will be online in a bit so I‚Äôll let you know and we can discuss a price
---
yeah one of those animatronics, noticed the same
---
Because the damage difference between 5mm shot out of a civil war era gatling gun and a modern minigun is totally anecdotal and not backed up with any hard numbers at all.
---
That seems a bit excessive. It's more like if your weapons and armor did not change their names or show stats in the inspect menu after getting mods or legendary effects. So you just had three "handmade rifle" in your inventory and had to keep equipping them to see which one was the TSE, which is the quad automatic, and which one is the prime AA.
---
Buy Skyrim and sacrifice a goat or poultry to Todd Howard
---
Dicks will be dicks.
---
Someone got your goat there, champ?
---
This was probably it, thank you. They came towards the end of the defense event that always pops up after you claim a workshop. If this happens again I should probably just find another server.
---
Really?  I've killed more than one of these.  They are tough yeah, but I've killed only one sentry bot and it was far harder to me.  They spawn a lot at the raider camp by the top of the world train station.  Usually see ever rank from regular gutsy all the way to colonel gutsy there.
---
Which bunker?
---
I know your pain, I don't craft a single shit it's been like 2 weeks, but still grab every clipboard and adhesive I find.
---
NOT TODAY! Today is the day I'll play this game and stop all this crap, I'm stronger than this, wish me luck.
---
This is mine 
---
https://imgur.com/a/6zEVx18

They do! It is a rare event drop.
---
Okay. So?
---
You must have turned pacifist back on or not realized you didn‚Äôt turn it off‚Äîand then misread the notification. Easy enough in the heat of the moment. 
---
The only pacifist notification is to remind you that you have it on and it happens when you shoot another player. 
---
...........
---
Your house coulda been "not up to code" or maybe I'm trying to have a friend load into server and your in his spot, or trying to rank my bounty up for a proper manhunt. There's could be a decent enough reason and I'd still throw those into raider antics without having to stop and chat. 
---
At least let me use the mini nuke as a trap. Let me place it down somewhere and shoot it to set it off. As it is now the small brown paper bag that shouldnt fit the much larger mini nuke should explode when I shoot it with a mini nuke inside it
---
This, please. The textures are so grungy and the font is so small that it's impossible for me to read anything. I love reading the lore in the games but this issue makes it super hard. Had the same problem in FO4.
---
No, I only found my armor, I found 3 of my melee weapons, bought two from vendors for like 30c ea, bought a combat knife for 300, a sledgehammer from a guy for 500 and my 4 star is a sacrificial blade that I bought from 11k.
---
News regarding the game.
---
It would be nice if the spaceman suit filtered the air.  I can't even use it because it doesn't function.
---
I like to give out fully upgraded under armors to lower level players normally VTU suits. I lost two this week because of the FN bag glitching out, SOOOOO pissed I takes many Hours to get all the MATS to make them......so I will be putting them in containers now TY
---
Is this supposed to be news? Good reporting there, bud. 
---
&gt;!Whitesprings Bunker/Enclave!&lt;
---
I think I speak for all of us when I say that We're tired of shit tier drops when we're level 100 or more. 
---
I dont want to grind random servers for days just to find one halfway decent legendary while running into people carrying 3-4 two shot explosive guns.
---
Ive been grinding for 3 weeks and still havent gotten a 2 star bloodied unarmed weapon.
---
Fuck me, right bethesda?
---
I think I just killed my own drive to continue playing.
---
I just hit level 100 last night. Got one tse drop at 96, before that I had two two shots and 2 explosives. And I went thru my stash and found that I had a couple weapons that were explosive that I didnt know I had. Never checked the second star info on them. 
---
Everything I have was mostly from whitesprings and an occasional legendary mole miner in the ash heap. 
---
Yes same here, you have to wait and don't try opening your pipboy until you can move, otherwise you get stuck
---
So is rocket league and god forbid fortnite 
---
Show me where Fo76 hurt you.
---
High enough lvl to do it yourself no? How are you unsure of your lvl lol
---
And better still, killing a 3star mob and they dont drop SHIT!
---
Tackleberry_G count me in
---
I found a scorchbeast nearby at level 24 and shot a flare in the general direction hoping someone would come kill it for me.  Sadly there was no one even close by :/
---
Ok, thanks
---
Would like the bright light. My psn is MadDogTannen711. 
---
There's a link with the article. You can't post direct link in this sub.
---
None of those really interest me except Monster Hunter World, God of War, RDR 2, and maybe Spiderman but I haven't got that one yet and not sure if I will. So my taste doesn't quite align with the majority I guess. Yet here I am playing Fallout 76 and putting as many hours into it as some of my all time favorite games.
---
You are right, that was actually excessive :-) 
---
I just ask for the mats, it‚Äôs like 5 plastic and 2 steel I believe. Don‚Äôt really care about the steel, I am just wicked short on plastic (shotgun build) so it‚Äôs a precious commodity to me haha
---
The time where i had trouble was between lvl15-35 personally. I'm only lvl 47 but i find the game easier now.
---
What lvl is it?
---
Late release against a year of strong sellers. Not surprised at all it didn‚Äôt sell as many copies in a month and a half as other games that had all year to rack up sales. For sure doesn‚Äôt indicate a flop though because we have no idea the budget for the gene, investment in the studio, or any hard sales numbers to back it up. Only time will tell if/how severe damaged caused by this game will show to Bethesda/Zenimax overall. 
---
Point is this isn't news. 
---
T-60 power armor. Enough said.
---
What's the context here OP? You can't really terrorize people in this game unless you're cheating and if you do, that person can server hop away from you instantly. 
---
You're not wrong, I'm just wondering what happened that you couldn't avoid. They've put in a lot of work making sure that players have a hard time griefing. 
---
What if I only take some of the junk? 
---
I'd love to have the Plasma Defender back. I hate the cobbled-together look of the current plasma guns.

I do think the same, I really like the game. Our local game magazines gave it a bad rating. Then on the other hand they always rate the main flagship games good, which come out in its 20th version and never brought a lot of new things, cause prolly those gaming companies pay good for sponsoring. If I always went for the 100% titles my gaming life would be always be the same :).
---
I like Fo76 and the server crashes don't bug me, I game on Linux, I am hardened :). 
---
As a former console player who migrated to PC, please, no.  While their are still griefers and assholes on PC, they are limited to creating accounts and buying a new game rather than having accounts already to go and not having to purchase the game again.
---
This leads to more problematic communities on consoles.  I'd prefer it stays there.
---
I ll swnd an fr in a minute

This reminds me of my all time favorite character. Aaron from Shakespeare's Titus.
---
https://youtu.be/xcLGJ0c-X9k
---
Lucius.¬†Art thou not sorry for these heinous deeds?
---
Aaron.¬†Ay, that I had not done a thousand more.¬†
---
Even now I curse the day‚Äîand yet, I think,¬†
---
Few come within the compass of my curse,‚Äî¬†
---
Wherein I did not some notorious ill,¬†
---
As kill a man, or else devise his death,¬†
---
Ravish a maid, or plot the way to do it,¬†
---
Accuse some innocent and forswear myself,¬†
---
Set deadly enmity between two friends,¬†
---
Make poor men's cattle break their necks;¬†
---
Set fire on barns and hay-stacks in the night,¬†
---
And bid the owners quench them with their tears.¬†
---
Oft have I digg'd up dead men from their graves,¬†
---
And set them upright at their dear friends' doors,¬†
---
Even when their sorrows almost were forgot;¬†
---
And on their skins, as on the bark of trees,¬†
---
Have with my knife carved in Roman letters,¬†
---
'Let not your sorrow die, though I am dead.'¬†
---
Tut, I have done a thousand dreadful things¬†
---
As willingly as one would kill a fly,¬†
---
And nothing grieves me heartily indeed¬†
---
But that I cannot do ten thousand more.
---
So I think it is role playing. Maybe you shouldn't play the victim. Try building somewhere other than the middle of the road.
---
Wow! VERY well made, thank you! Keep it up!!
---
I noticed from a quick scroll through that **Sweet Roll** is missing from the **S.P.E.C.I.A.L.** list. I can't remember the ingredients and I'm not in game right now, but I know it gives **+3 CHA**. It is a super helpful add on for doing vendor runs.
---
Nope. I‚Äôm terrible solo. And I‚Äôm not looking at my character right now so I don‚Äôt quite know but it‚Äôs somewhere around there.
---
This reminds me of an oldb classic Buddhist tale. A man was being chased by a feroucious tiger. He came to a cliff and climbed down to escape. Half way down he says another hungry tiger below him. Then, on a shitter in front of him he sees a noodle bowl, plucks it, and eats it. It was the sweetest noodle bowl he ever ate.
---
You mean whining about misunderstanding mechanics and beating the same 5 dead horses under the guise of ‚Äúobjectivity‚Äù
---
There are I believe 4 apps for your phone that do exactly this.
---
Thats one legit ass house.
---
Impressive. 
---
Maybe I Aughta work on mine some more. 
---
Keeping my farm though.
---
If I play today, my mission is the most scenic and beautiful spot that has water.
---
Yas.
---
What do you mean? 
---
there should def be a robot NPC hosting Appalachia Radio, and just more interesting robot NPCs in general, like I get that you want every person to be real (still think it's lame and there should be NPCs), but it's not like past Fallout games weren't littered with interesting robots, even this game acknowledges that there can be interesting robot NPCs with Rose, so why is she the only one?
---
then you found something you desperately need, i personally have my own supply route that keeps all my essentials stocked up so I dont mind if you loot my corpse
---
I too have a PS4 Pro and i just tought maybe i could disable boost mode and see if it helps... 
---
Odds are the only things you're missing are dupped TSE weapons and bobbleheads. No way a level 13 should be able to survive Whitespring. 
---
You can put another door frame (the same model) facing the opposite way and the door will fit. It essentially allows both sides of the frame to have the interior look. Hope this helps!
---
Yeah he‚Äôs smoking crack. I two shot them with a suppressed shotgun. Sure as fuck not two shotting a sentry bot
---
Why do you feel necessary to post things like this, if no one here is going to care?
---
People that bought, and play the game aren't going to care that it didn't sell as many copies as horse balls simulator.
---
It's a three day old article... I didn't see anything posted here about it. Apparently some people got hurt, it wasn't my intention at all.
---
It's better with the latest patch (on my end) but still far from perfect.
---
Jet pack and emergency protocols are sold
---
All of them, take them all. You want me to buy more? Done.
---
Tab out and head over to Youtube? 
---
This would be fantastic! I hope we eventually see changes like this to the world.
---
I mean you've got to be cheating to even consider trying the former. Slap damage is laughable. Hell sometimes full damage from lower levels is hilariously unthreatening. 
---
I've been trashing some dude's base and someone showed up halfway through to get the 300 odd caps the bounty was up to. I tried to kite him around the remaining walls to show I wasn't trying to harm anyway but he wouldn't leave well enough alone, so we ended up with a series of battles in the original dude's house that never even showed up. 
---
Jesus what system? Nobody is gonna want to team up cause you're too thick to.evwn post your platform haha. Sorry kid.  
---
Chasing someone down who very obviously is not interested in PVP. Killing people who are in the middle of doing menial tasks like reading a terminal or building their camp or just collecting materials.
---
As far as I'm concerned, workshops are fair game tho. They're designed to take advantage of the PVP aspect of the game. 
---
I already knew as much but my carry weight with the armor pieces effects is showing 275 or 285 (all 5 are deep-pocketed and I think all are +1 strength. I‚Äôll have to double check when I get home but ty)
---
Did you get it ?
---
Did this post upset you in some manner? It's literally two link, no opinions or anything.
---
I agree...If not meals and drinks at least the materials to make them.
---
Hahaha, that was a joke about how they always use the same 3 factions. 
---
No one should be surprised by this.
---
Ok. Im away for a few hours at the moment. How much are you asking?
---
Best three levels I ever spent. If you're going after a wanted criminal in his house, it's great. If you want to tear down someone's house, it's even better. 
---
Except you cant access it in game
---
Buy the 4000 atoms bundle package 7 times in a row
---
don't forget when people post r/thathappened pvp stories and then for the next week 5 or 6 people post similar stories every day!
---
i killed a duper! upvotes to the left!
---
Now this I would buy
---
Cuz it‚Äôs awesome 
---
I agree but most people have their phone right here beside them. It's pretty intuitive and the best solution for your current problem. Sure it's not in game but it works and works better than any in game system probably would. 
---
A++ pic m8.  Great angles and filter
---
Pretty sure it'll be more than 5%, unless I'm talking as one of those 5% lol. Personally what I see it being is just a massive hunting ground. There won't be much reason to team up with randoms as they can (and probably will) turn on you at any moment. Why do a raid where accidental friendly fire is common, when you can just do it safely on a normal server?
---
I am personally stoked for the idea of a PVP server, but it's for the sole reason to hunt. That being said, I think the few caps you get for a kill and a bit of junk is not reward enough.
---
It doesn't upset me, it's just confusing to me that people enjoy going to a sub, which the majority of users in it enjoy the game, just to compare it to other games.
---
That was the thing to do last November, but most of those people realized that shit posting the game here really doesn't benefit them, so they left.
---
Defending a position, what you term ‚Äútrying hard to sound smart‚Äù, is an ungrateful loser‚Äôs ad-hominem way to say they can‚Äôt defend their claim. 
---
Here:

https://www.google.com/amp/s/theconversation.com/amp/no-youre-not-entitled-to-your-opinion-9978
---
Because the BoS has access to a highly manufactured set of pre-war power armor? Former military personal have access to military gear and weapons? Theres just no way. Obvious call for outrage 
---
Ok no worries, probably be asleep in a few hours, but we can do this tomorrow. I ll let it go for 400 caps
---
You can place a single marker on the map, unfortunately it gets overwritten when you replace it, but if you're in a group with others, they can see your markers at least.
---
You could combo it with the space suit helmet you find at the crashed space station. I‚Äôm not sure of their aesthetic differences, but it‚Äôs functional
---
Yep. Same. Energy weapons got the shaft in 76
---
I'm leveling an alt.
---
I got lead belly early because it helps and will swap out later.
---
I go with 4 end but I'm lazy and eat dog food
---
Ok, good to know.  I'll definitely pay more attention and slowly do it next time.
---
You know that up button on the d-pad that opens up your fav menu? Yeah that should be able to switch with r1/rb and l1/lb to 4 perk loadouts and a menu for your power armor chassis.
---
I was walking in my back yard the other day and saw a golf ball.  First thing though my head was "ooo plastic"
---
Can we define what exactly you mean by 'griefing' here? Theres no context other than "ur an asshole!!!"
---
This is pretty awesome!
---
I'd love to contribute but I have a carnivore mutation so at the very least the healing stat will be skewed.
---
Speaking of which, do you intend at some stage to include a carnivore/herbivore toggle to see stat benefits? Maybe the same with thru-hiker for weight?
---
It didn't manage to get in the December list as well (or november).

&gt; On the same note,[the list for best selling games in the december/18](https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/01/22/red-dead-redemption-2-tops-us-game-sales-for-2018-smash-bros-wins-december) period doesn't feature the new title of the franchise as well. 
---
You can just have it. I‚Äôll be on later tonight and maybe some tomorrow if you want to try to meet up. 
---
Yup.
---
I'm not shocked. 
---
Its no big secret the game was rough at launch and the sales reflect that.
---
Indeed. Karma whoring in a sub of this size and shape is like digging for gold in a playground sandbox. 
---
I was going to say, it almost looks like a Fallout 2 intro shot. With a little roughage or film grain, it would fit right in. Nice one!
---
This is bullshit though. Some kid was controlling a workshop yesterday. The junkyard. And I like to take that workshop. Its useful and gives you a lot of junk. So i get there. And i tell the kid that he should leave because I was like 20 levels higher. Knowing i can kill him no problem. He just kept asking why do i have to leave. Because i said so. If not fight back and i was already in PVP with him but he just wouldnt try. I told him i wasnt going to kill him. That he should just leave and let me take it. But he wouldn't. then my friend who was lower than him came over and killed him. Then he got butthurt and called me an asshole and all. Like it wasn't that deep. I was trying to be nice and he could have fought back. But he didn't. Like theres a reason Bethesda put that in the game. If you want something take it or fight for it. Thats the kind of world this game is based off. Now if i constantly sought out this kid to kill him and all then id be a dick and all. But all i was doing was playing the game. Tried to be nice. But in the end had no choice. 
---
"Shill assholes"? ü§îüòÇ Yeah, kinda hard to take you seriously when you talk like that. You don't have to be an asshole to try PvP or the bounty system, and it's definitely not my fault if you haven't played the game as it was designed.
---
Thank you! Building is really fun in this game. 
---
Is this still a thing? Never had this one, hella funny tho.
---
I feel you. I'm inclined to gather a full set of troubleshooter marine armor just to run AWOL armaments event.
---
I see, whatever floats your boat, man. I enjoyed the game at a time, but find it way too frustrating and Bethesda‚Äôs damage control to be insulting. Circlejerk time: if you haven‚Äôt already, you should try Red Dead 2. I played it after 76 and every moment and interaction is something to remember. It‚Äôs a better RPG than Fallout, somehow.
---
They didn't expect anyone to play that long.
---
&gt; Considering you can server hop and block people; I would say that griefing is non existent in this game. (if you are being griefed and refused to leave that's really on you.)
---
Agreed. Bethesda's gone out of their way to study how other people have gotten away with griefing in other online games and taken numerous steps to ensure their game doesn't become that. I mean step one is the classic MMO level 100 guy camps out in front of where level 1 noobs spawn and kills them thing. If it's 2019 and you're making an online game that doesn't take these steps you're asking for it to ruin your game. 
---
&gt; I've had people walk into my workshops, try to take my shit, get killed by me and then they proceed to call me a griefer.
---
Well that's just saltiness, idek what they're trying to say there. 
---
&gt; people killing you, attacking your base or workshop, and taking your supplies is not griefing.
---
Agreed 100%. Especially the workshop bit. The game tells you before you ever claim it you're opening yourself up to PVP. The rare instances of people trying to claim my workshops are usually packs of 3-4 dudes (literally never 2 or less) that want to pvp. They don't even want the workshop. You can A) hop away and then they don't have anything to do or B) fight outnumbered. Your choice but still not griefing. 
---
Playing a female avatar ends up with similar results. -random free stuff is nice. I'll pick it up, turn on my mic and say "thanks dude". I have no shame.- (My main is modeled after me, my alt is modeled after my wife -who tosses me a judgmental look and arches her eyebrow every flippin time- lara croft is awesome and who else am I going to put the maiden of mysteries set on???)
---
But anyway, the worse harassment I've seen was a dude that was super young (pre-teen young) that kept trying to get a girl's social media info. (He spent time to make his avatar look like hitler). The most you can do is call them out when it happens, offer to mansplain how to use the in-game ignore/block feature, and move on. 
---
Seasoned veteran girl gamers can handle themselves just fine. Sometimes just letting them know that you'll back their play when it's warranted is all that is needed.
---
Bethesda needs to learn how to make an effective UI for all of their games.
---
Darn lol. I just made a post about this. But I agree!
---
My husband goes to people's workshops and then fights with them when they show up to defend them. He doesn't pretend to be a raider or do any RP bullshit. He full understands that he's kind of being a dick and owns it. He doesn't pick on low levels though. He has standards. People that kick over other people's camps, *especially low level people's camps*, are just being jerks for the sake of it. Unless I hear some serious RP coming out of your mic, and have an RP experience that's worth my camp being shit on, you're not roleplaying. End of. 
---
Example: I had an actual "raider" attack my camp a while ago. I've written about it here somewhere but it was one of the best experiences in this game. Dude was just laughing maniacally while I watched helplessly from inside. He slowly bashed his way to me and started yelling crazy shit and carrying on. Dude should have been a voice actor because god damn did he sell the crazy raider shit. At this point I was honestly just impressed and excited to see where it was going. I kick myself all the time for not recording any of this. 
---
At the end, I jokingly asked him how to become a raider after he chased me around for a bit. He just dropped a bag with one screw in it and faded into the sunset. I could have ended the engagement at any time, even saved most of my base because he was just going at it a piece at a time (for drama I assume), but I just let it happen because it was worth it. 
---
Yeah...I went after a bounty on a level 131 as a level 40. Thought he was a level 13... Shot him once and got demolished. 
---
lol the dude got stomped so calls in his TSE duper buddies to do his dirty work. 
---
Block, hop, rebuild, done. 
---
Again unsurprising as the initial 2 weeks would‚Äôve seriously hurt sales in the following few. The first major patch didn‚Äôt come out til 12/11, with a follow on the next week. By then it‚Äôs too late to pull any more sales before Christmas when sales of other games spike. 
---
You‚Äôre not exactly contributing new information here. Stuffs been posted and discussed before. 
---
Not sure I will check when I have a chance to get on
---
Right I found a tight rope location and dont remember where it was.
---
&gt; do you intend at some stage to include a carnivore/herbivore toggle to see stat benefits? Maybe the same with thru-hiker for weight?
---
I do.
---
&gt; Also might be worthwhile pointing out somewhere that these stat bonuses aren't stackable, even across food types.
---
This should be pretty self-explanatory because when you add several types of food with the same bonus, it increases the duration but not the potency.
---
Use a Gamma gun. Melt-tacular. 
---
No, because in every previous game it was stated that T-51b was the most advanced set of power armor made before the bombs fell. Then comes Fallout 4, and suddenly T-60 is a thing and the X-01 armor was developed before the war, not 200 years later as originally stated. 
---
Dude why are you spamming now?
---
Watoga school has a huge amount of plastic in the cafe area.
---
"We all know that..." No. No, we don't. Your opinion is not the only valid one, despite how many weenies tell you they quit.
---
Is this fallout equestria reference?
---
Always need a good screw, or some ballistic fiber. You can keep all your bulk oil/cloth/leather/ext.
---
I've deleted the last post. Too much salt.
---
nice idea, could use ice machine as a freezer
---
Awesome! Ill give you double if you can hold it. Been looking for it longer than i care to admit. Thanks man.
---
Whoa...
---
I got my first one today, and I could not believe from where: some unbelievable vault dweller had sold a TSE western revolver to Phoenix in Watoga. Its price: 534 caps. I'm like, "SOLD!" Not everyone's into pistols, but I'm a sneaky cowboy through and through.
---
Sweet thanks! 
---
Or if the more you played at each one, the better you got.
---
Gaming now means that we have to not only accept that people will be shitheads but we are supposed to embrace it. Like sea of thieves has people stealing from other people then they want to be patted on the back. Even when its part of a game its still shitty. Gaming has coddled poor behaviour in gamers and now we are at a point that if you dont enjoy a incel trying to ruin your day then you are the one with teh problem. I love video games but goddamn i really dont like Gamers.
---
Double it is then, and for you it will wait :) i ve been farming for more than 10 hours and i think i saw this mod 2, maybe 3 times
---
if you have crappy luck then ur screwed ive had the game since beta and all the tse's i have are from trading good luck!
---
I once ate my explosive handmade
---
I think my main issue with people that are "role playing" as raiders is that it's just an excuse for most of them. Like it's part of the mechanics of the game that you can kick over someone else's camp. If you're just doing that to do it then own that you're an asshole. If you're gonna use role playing as an excuse, I'm gonna need to experience some words, actions, or visuals that distinguish you from any other guy kicking over camps. 
---
That‚Äôs one of the locations I visited multiple times on my hops. Thanks though. 
---
Perfect idea On the check point. Def have been trying to drop my first nuke so just spammed a card and tried to punch faster.
---
Lesson learned 
---
List does not include digital sales, so is useless to me. 
---
If you‚Äôre making razorgain soup all the time then I don‚Äôt even think you‚Äôll need Thru Hiker since it only weighs half a pound each and if you need more then you can just go back to your camp so you don‚Äôt have to carry much!
---
Nailed it.
---
This guy just have a gas mask inside it's skull. If you try to do that you will be dead.
---
Yeah, it will be less salt NOW.
---
So what is your intention here.
---
Right and everyone that just want to garden and look for other players to sell tea to don't have to deal with all of that. 
---
I'm fine with it, I'll probably play on the survival server and full time an Assassin's set. Assassin + Lone Wanderer + Dodgy + whatever actual armor you have work really well. When people are used to one shotting and barely hurt you they start changing their minds real quick. 
---
Its going to be the same again. Ppl don't care if a game they enjoy doesn't make lists.
---
Fo76 was on alot of ppls worst games of 2018 lists too.
---
All rise - what are the perks?
---
The future begins in the future. With DLC that they'll make us buy.
---
Id say "I hope x y or z happens" 
---
But they still have to solve problems with the original game, so I dont expect much.
---
Raider 1: "Where the hell is that music coming from? I told you to turn off the radio; I hate the Beach Boys!"
---
Raider 2: "I did, Boss, I swear!" 
---
Raider 1: "What, you think I'm stupid?! I hear music, and we're the only ones here. Time to teach you who's in charge!"
---
Raider 2: "No, Boss, please! ARGH!!!"
---
Raider 1: " 'Wouldn't it be nice' if you still had intestines?!"
---
Raider 2: "AARRRGHhhh..."

Player: "Tee Hee..."
---
My wife and I play while sitting next to each other often, here are all the things we have noticed: 
---
many times the game decides to only display one or two pieces of armor, and fails to load underarmor, remaing armor, and outer costumes. At first it seemed like it may have been due to costumes she was wearing from the atomic shop. After further testing, no it just happens randomly with any clothing/armor setup.
---
Sometimes the game will display chameleon effects to observers incorrectly. This seems to happens both ways: displays character to observers when it shouldn't or fails to display it when it should.
---
But by far the worst is when it fails to load anypart of the the player or even the floating name bar or screen indicators. 
---
The only way I have found to fix any of this is to rejoin the world, it always fixes the issues  (until it returns)
---
Purrfect.
---
New to the internet? 
---
It's amazing how many people that only speak one language and their native one at that talk and write like they only finished 8th grade. 
---
&gt;I think their to-do list is way too long to consider adding end-game content any time soon, or even have working mechanics for end-game content any time soon.
---
That sucks for them though.  As a player, one that purchased on launch, I don't care about their laundry list of todos.  The large majority of those issues should have been sorted out during beta and the first month of release.
---
End game content should have been the first major update.  Why?  Because it wouldn't require any rebalance.  The same broken mechanics could suffice.  The issue that high level players have isn't that they hate the mechanics, it's that they have nothing to do; so they notice how bad the mechanics are.
---
I have stopped myself from posting here when ever I see "I'm level #&lt;40 and this is the most fun I have had in the game.". I don't comment, because that was somewhat how I felt.  In the early and midgame you get to explore and feel the power creep to get a sense of progression.  It feels great.  It almost completely outshines the obvious flaws of 76.
---
But after about 75 levels you start to see the cracks.  You have no choice but to stare into the abyss.  Every session is the same gameplay loop, and it's flawed to all hell.  Run a bunker, drop a nuke, harvest ghouls or raid.  Rinse, repeat 100 times and still only end up with instigating drill while your equip sucks down resources from repairs.
---
There is no exploration left, there is no more significant power gains short of a good random drop from a terribad loot table.  You are just aimlessly dropping nukes on the exact same places over and over while glaring at every bug in the game.  Then a DC happens and you think, "I'll just go play this game for a bit," and a week later you can't understand why you would go back to 76.
---
The game is fucked, and "adding" a PVP mode 3 months after the release while the game is now just a polished turd is indicitive of not only Bethesda's terrible choice to not flesh out their Fallout 4 mod before release, but also how out of touch with the community they are.
---
It's a mortar, requires power. Next to it is a box where you get smoke flares. Toss the flare like a grenade and where it lands missiles start raining down from the sky. Set them higher up for better range.
---
It's fun to play around with.
---
LOL im done with you, my pc is far from a potato, but thanks for you input.
---
Yup! And if anyone's waiting in line for the vendor, I always 'heart' to indicate (awkwardly) that I've left something. I've even left fairly good legendaries that I honestly don't have the desire to sell or clog up my inventory. If someone close by can benefit from the fun I'm having with the game, rock on.
---
This guy Atom shops
---
Brrrrrrrrrrrrriiiiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnngggggggggggg iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit
---
Admittedly my C.A.M.P. no longer has turrets as I need the room for those sweet, sweet letters and signs but each of my workshops are all missiles and heavy lasers. 
---
You could farm it for a month and never see one.
---
They're rare outside of dupes
---
I found a TSE combat rifle that I traded for a TSE of a gun I actually use. The people with 20 of the things are either dupers or trade with dupers.
---
If they don't care, why so much hostility. They're not indifferent, they're salty.
---
As much as I dont like the playstyle, you have to respect it for its creativity and cleverness. Really, you have to either arm yourself or accept a a server jump.
---
Oh noes its not as popular as rdr2 it must be a flop. maybe fo76 would have made more money if it was p2w like rdr2's online mode.
---
you trolls are really stretching to bash the game now.
---
A lot of the weapons in this game are WW1 era. The Assault rifle resembles water cooled machine guns like the Vickers. The pump looks like a Winchester 1897. The combat rifle resembles an M1918 Browning. 
---
What if we could just get saved perk card setups we could add to our favorites wheel
---
And that's a big deal because?
---
Okay i can give you that the settlements and such do add more hours. For me i simply do all the quests and locations and i call it done. So to me 76 had more content as it had more locations. But i guess that would make a little more sense
---
You should post in market 76 so you know you have the correct format, what platform are you even on?
---
Ok, so not only do you not get what hyperbole is, you don't think a game that constantly crashes to desktop "impacts the core game". Wow, you're...special. 
---
Yesterday, alone, I had three crash to desktop events. I got stuck in a workshop animation and had to end process the game to get out of it. I had three legendary enemies not drop legendary loot. In about two hours.  
---
I, if you would _fucking read_ edited the post to point out one that had _literally just fucking happened_. It wasn't an out of my ass example, it was a _current_ example. 
---
Game content requires SIGNIFICANT fucking development. You'd think that people would, especially given the broken ass launch state of this game, want them to take the time to _actually develop new content_. 
---
Again, this game is only a _couple of months old_ and you have to be a _fucking moron_ to actually expect any sort of large DLC at this point. 
---
Tbh I think assaultrons need bumped up. 
---
A weaponized mr handy shouldnt be firing Anti-matter rounds at my character, who's made entirely of matter, yet the assaultron fires a laser beam that does fast but manageable damage.
---
I have been doing it longer than that. The drop rate is very low. 
---
Ya that cheap get a on my nerves so much. Killing a 3 star legendary and they have nothing..
---
You can cancel the power armor landing animation by drawing your weapon. 
---
You missed his point I think.
---
We are indifferent to the list. We are salty about your "concern" trolling.
---
But that still doesnt make sense because this universe was culturally stuck in the 50s theme. 
---
Well when you think about it, raiders are nothing but assholes. Think about some of the things they've done in other games, much worse than destroying a house
---
So what lol the game is amazing 
---
No, F76 is also a failure in the critics department. It's rated lowest than No Man's Sky.
---
Ya I barely hit 69... Not joking and its f-in irritating as hell. How people played to 100 and up I have no idea.
---
I have 7 but use PA weight reduction perk, as long as I keep them on me they have a total weight of 17.5 instead of taking up 70 in my stash, and I have to deploy all 7 regularly because the one I'm looking randomly comes out last.
---
X-01. Glory to the Enclave! 
---
As much as I hate microtransactions, as long as it isn't overpriced (Not more than 500 atom per increase) this is a way to ensure the servers remain stable.
---
What‚Äôs the range on it? 
---
Whatever. Just suck it up.
---
The outfit plans spawns randomly in certain locations. Check the wiki for locations. 
---
should be there right outside the door. did you give it time to load up? I actually got to a stash box fast enough in charlston the only option i had was search and the robot wasnt even there.
---
Agree.
---
&gt;"Why bother? That's just garbage. I'd toss it."  - Cait
---
&gt;you shouldn't have rushed, the game has plenty to explore
---
That was a legit rebuttal in the first month.  Now though?  Nah, I am only 75 and have opened up nearly every POI.  There is nothing to do, and the stuff there is to do is not worth the time. 
---
Why would I keep running bunkers, killing ghouls or SBQ and get a punch to the face for spending an hour of my life by receiving damaged equipment, and an bloodied lead pipe?
---
90% reduces weight, and 10+ heath, does around 250 damage on my character and weighs 8 pounds 
---
They need to add mods or something. In in the same boat as you
---
You asked how it was lore-breaking, and I answered. Now I'm starting to think you just want to argue, and I have no interest in that.
---
Lmao I dont care if you think Im an asshole.
---
I've usually seen the costs increases for more and more space, but a set cost for a moderately set space is absolutely doable. 
---
... if one's standards are low enough.
---
All rise is a quest reward you can get yourself. Don't give this duper garbage your cash. 
---
Travel to the dam on Rt 65 near thunder mountain. When you spawn in at the dam turn around so that you‚Äôre looking at the 4 way intersection then take a left. A dead trick or treater has a chance to spawn in the small bend in the road like 20-30 feet from that intersection with the witch costume plans on them. If the dead trick or treater doesn‚Äôt spawn just keep hopping servers until they do. I was doing it earlier and got the Skeleton costume plans on my 4th try. 
---
The guns I mentioned were used in WW2 as well. Remember that WW2 drove a lot of rapid innovation in weaponry but most countries started with left overs from previous wars. 
---
Yeah, best not to think about it too hard. Lord knows Bethesda doesn't :P
---
Sitting on 4000 right now... only thing's I bought were the Cowboy Hat, Patriot PA paint and the Black Pip Boy today. 
---
3 Items, out of dozens. There's so much stuff in the Fallout universe that there's plenty of room for cool *and* zany stuff, unfortunately the market's leaning towards zany.
---
Why?
---
Just thought I‚Äôd come upvote this while I wait to load back in after getting disconnected for the third time in five minutes. 
---
Ouch. didn't like being called out for being a troll.
---
I bought it.
---
Princess bed pride!
---
It looks out of place as shit next to my grimey barn walls and broken windows.
---
Bethesda made a \_stupid\_ decision to heavily nerf legendary drops...early adopters are massively over-powered. People who grind for hundreds of hours now don't get the quality of loot early adopters could easily farm. 
---
Yep. Sure did. I play every day at least a few hours and always check. 
---
&gt; At the end, the level 19 gave me a bunch of hardened masses, saying he didn't need them yet.
---
 Why bother? That's just garbage. I'd toss it. - Cait 
---
Yes, if one's standards of 'fun' are low enough.
---
Hit me up at death_smitty 
---
Hit me up, death_smitty 
---
Just leave me to play with my rolls dude, not hurting anyone.
---
Nobody intentionally hit lvl 100, we've just been grinding so hard that we level up 100+ times. 
---
Frankly it's killed the game for me.
---
Only thing fun now is building or harassing griefers.
---
Hey am I the only one that likes his bed? I think it‚Äôs the best in the game and it‚Äôs amazing to have
---
I‚Äôm just trying to get rid of inventory, I‚Äôll sell it gladly for 50 caps, way below what it‚Äôs worth even as a quest item 
---
There are hundreds of other games not in this top 20. I‚Äôm expecting you to post this ‚Äûnews‚Äú in every appropriate subreddit ...
---
Nah even bad games (like sonic 06) can be fun in a morbid kind of way.
---
Your standards have to be low to accept something like p2w as acceptable.
---
Well thats a crap ton of years after the bombs f76 is only 26 or 27 years after the bombs.
---
Most of the story and irl after something devastating happens most people come together and help\rebuild. A small few loot and pillage. Frankly I think this early in especially with local enclave and bos and the responders aka police, fireman are still maintaining order. 
---
I'm actually I feel based on what I've seen of people is that those "raiders" would kill themselfs off real quick. Not to mention the military aka enclave and bos killing the he'll out of them.. Machete vs power armor...
---
I, for one, like the silly shit. If I‚Äôm trying to survive in a wasteland and I find a racecar bed, you bet your ass I‚Äôm taking it home to find a little joy in the world.
---
I have gotten over the queen.  Was fun the first five or so times  we killed her. Now... not so much. Maybe it's because I don't need more ultracite explosive vents.
---
Easy there Dump, not everyone can be as smart as you. Take it easy on him, everyone forgets.
---
Thank you.
---
Troll?
---
I mean, technically the just made a revision to the lore. It's not like that hasn't been done before. You did answer the question, but people acted like it was heresy
---
Very true. Apologies OP
---
sorry for the delay. if you didn't receive a set from anyone yet I'm able to jump on anytime now through the end of the night. psn regulator_84
---
I will play it when it is available on the PC.
---
I agree, pay-to-win and low intelligence games like F76 are the worst there's out there.
---
nah fun varies from person to person. for example some people like fallout and hate elder scroll while others the opposite is true, even though it is the same type of game just a different coat of paint.
---
Your standards are messed up if you think paying not to play a game is fun. (ie pay to win).
---
I only have 2 sets, but a way I distinguish which is which is by using an atom shop paint on one and leaving the other default. The paint makes the little atom shop icon appear next to it.
---
FO isn‚Äôt P2W tho. 
---
Calm down, man. That isn't a personal offence against you, no need for the salt.
---
1 - people mad its online
---
2 - people mad there was pvp 
---
3 -  griefers mad that pvp was very limited and protected players
---
4 - Game was unfinish. Need to bake some more.
---
5 - Offline players of teh series hated always online.
---
6 -  offline players dont like no modding
---
7 - offline players dont like no cheating
---
8 - offline players dont like social.
---
9 - game breaking bugs, unlimited exp, easy duping,
---
10 - out of touch developers
---
11 -  game going for the cha ching over quality
---
12 - many more things but getting sick of typing
---
13 - the hate train started for all these reason and more.  Its easy to just say the game sucks and everyone go YUP!
---
Lmao so you have such low standards you can‚Äôt even enjoy something as trivial as a video game because... other people say you shouldn‚Äôt? Good one neck beard. 
---
It's the little shack by the bridge on the golf course. 
---
Exactly my point with B being realistic with the game.
---
Okay
---
I don't know. I do just fine killing myself while using it without a damage buff.
---
I havent spent any money on atoms.
---
How said anything about pay-to-win?
---
yeah thats my old  spot back when I farmed WS
---
This is why we need PVE servers
---
I came across a vampire's punching glove. gave me a good laugh and I dropped it into the lunchbox on the platform at the whitesprings golf course, the dumping ground for legendaries I won't use
---
"I literally haven't played the game at all, why do people who have put in tens or hundreds of hours have legitimate complaints?" 
---
Except it is part of the game.
---
You don‚Äôt have to like it, but you have to deal with it. 
---
They‚Äôre assholes just as much as you are a crybaby.
---
Right, so it would make sense for this universe to have advanced as well right? Hopefully we'll see better weapon additions in the future. 
---
I am morbidly curious, how is fo76 a "low intelligence" game?
---
I‚Äôm online right now. I‚Äôll send you a friend request.
---
Did you make it to the Top of the World? Without going into spoilers, there were cannibal raiders, and they all actively preyed on people trying to get to the responders (such as the teacher lady who talks about water in
---
Flatwoods)  
---
Raiders covered all of the mountain range, and did extremely devastating stuff such as the Christmas Flood, let alone normal raiding actions.  
---
Its extensively talked in 76, especially in the terminals at the ski resorts
---
no Salt here, still waiting to your answer about your Intention regarding this News ...
---
Calm down, this isn't a personal offence against you. No reason for name calling... Jeez!
---
Thanks OP. I needed this. You must have saw my comment in the last thread.
---
well this list had a pay to win game at #1.
---
I love that you dressed your character around your weapoon.
---
You're playing a game in a post apocalyptic wasteland where everyone is running around with guns, I don't think it's fair to assume that everyone should just hold hands and sing
---
The power armor glitch was fixed months ago. When did you last play? That was a terrible bug I'm glad it's gone. I haven't experienced anything as game breaking as that. I've had my PA bug out just once since then, and relogging fixed it immediately. 
---
I couldent agree more someone completely destroyed my bace and i have no turrets to defend myself because i want my house to look nice and welcoming
---
...I have literally never had this problem. That's a first. 
---
Well said. Don't know why but this really got me laughing. Perhaps after 400 hours in it I've finally gained a sense of humor.
---
If I post a new about a politician, does it mean I'd need to follow every single politician and post a news about them as well?
---
What kind of retarded idea is this?
---
What are you really expecting us to say? First off how did disconnects empty your stash? 
---
There are great farming guides on here already if you you use the search function you will find them quite quickly. Good luck on getting your shit back. Hopefully you have learned some better storage discipline. 
---
As you don‚Äôt want to tell us openly, can you pm me the location so I can check it out? Would be cool.  It kinda sucks to tease this way and then keep the information for yourself... :(
---
If a level 121 player starts a fight with a level 6 player, that's griefing
---
Did you read his post? He carries most of his stuff with him.
---
Honestly, it's one of the primary reasons I have stopped playing a lot of online games. It makes gaming more frustrating than fun, and I just got really fed up of it. Fallout 76 has been a pleasant surprise. But still, I'm a bit hesitant to group with people. 
---
I want to know how many times I have cosplayed as a clown 
---
honestly I think people over 80+ should build a new character I did it to help a friend and I've found so many amazing things I missed and so many amazing ideas because of not having to run in circles looking for my next legendary super weapon that I missed the first time by 
---
Ya i read most of that stuff. I get were your coming from. Crazy is crazy. I still think the militant pressence would have went and wiped them out even with the scorched.
---
Scorched are literally being fought with axes and pitch forks. You even see that the responders had access to fork lifts and semis and military stations etc.. 
---
Agree to disagree.
---
Because missile turrets ruin your fun
---
Red Dead Redemption is a single payer, if you really want to cheat, you don't need to pay for it.
---
Aside, F76 has overpriced and disgusting micro-transactions.
---
On the same note, loot boxes were found in the Dev Room and the game's code. So pay-to-win isn't out of question... or at least was the plan at some point. 
---
I mean I loved the game at launch and took a hundred hours to platinum but in that time it just grinded my hopes and dreams into dust.
---
Dude he could just be selling his quest one 
---
Hey Slayden, you might not be aware, but asking for PM's for prices tends to be the preferred mode for Dupers and Cheaters in the game, might be better off posting open prices and transactions here.  Just a helpful tip.
---
If you're at WS also grab all the nuka-world cups, pretty sure they're also plastic and the outside of WS is littered with them (not the inside though, that's mostly fancier items lol)
---
I too am a scotch beast. Beer is too weak for me
---
Raiders stay dead after I kill them in other Fallout games.
---
When he said he lost EVRRYTHING I guess I assumed he wasn't a complete idiot running around with ALL of his crafting materials in his pockets.  
---
My bad I guess?
---
Just don‚Äôt log out at whitespring. Like seriously. 
---
It must be passive as I've just taken Blocker 2\* and at WhiteSpring I've noticed a big difference in my health drop against the Ghoul welcome parties. I'm on PC and have never gotten the hang of an attack block style of fighting, I just slug away until everything is dead.
---
So with out blocking myself the difference is very nice.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs where this one was. I‚Äôve never tried any of the other ones yet. Still tho, it‚Äôs annoying spending caps to go somewhere and it not work.
---
I mean, you insulted my standards so.
---
We shouldn't be encouraging them to update the game with cool content for money. It should be a free update. 
---
I want to be happy for you but damn I hate those things as a lower level player. And they sound horrible.
---
Their testers never reached 100.
---
Nope, didn‚Äôt even see a bot there.
---
I wasn‚Äôt aware of that, I‚Äôve never even tried to sell anything until today, will definitely change that ASAP, I appreciate the heads up
---
I wasn't judging you.  I just see a lot of spiffy camp features.  :)
---
I'm here so I'll know when things improve and it's worth playing.
---
Why is this hard to understand?
---
I don‚Äôt understand how stuff like this hasn‚Äôt been fixed yet lol
---
I agree with what you've stated as this is how I felt my first 100 or so hours in the wasteland FO76 provides.  After 400 hours in I felt left wanting more which is a good thing and bad with it being an online game. I've now taken a break in hopes for  more endgame in the future which has been said to be coming "at some point". Until then I'm glad you have climbed out of the vault to join us and jealous of your view I once had. Enjoy.
---
I think that if Bethesda *really* wanted to go cross-platform, they would implement it for everybody except for PS4.  This would help turn the screws on Sony.  I'm betting we would then see full cross-platform within a year of that.
---
What the hell man, these are just clearly just random low class legendaries from this guy's latest farming adventures. Some people finish Mayor For a Day before level 50 so their All Rise isn't as good as it should be, so some people do want them (especially for 50 caps). You clearly have no idea what you're talking about so don't go around throwing accusations, the dupers only duped op guns anyway.... 
---
I stand there and nothing happens. Ammo box is there but no stash next to it. Weird.
---
I'm sorry you felt that way.
---
It's an mmo you need to get over it.  Also it's role not roll your age is showing.
---
I spoke kindly of those who enjoy the game. Is there some reason why you must be derisive towards those who didn't?
---
Lots of games didn't make the lists though :)
---
 I am certain you are a troll pretending to be very stupid. There's no way someone could be so delusional as to think there's zero difference between the console and PC versions of the games, and further not understand how weak their CPU is, acting like 6 cores or 8 cores somehow makes their awful computer equivalent to vastly superior hardware. 
---
So unless you have severe head trauma, the only conclusion is that you're a troll.
---
"My friend is trying to load into the server and your in his spot" is a daft and ridiculous reason. That's like getting to a bar that filled up after your arrival and when your friend gets there walking up to a table and throwing people's food and drinks on the ground and punching them because they are "in his spot".
---
Don‚Äôt care, having fun.
---
Range isn't that great but gets better the higher up your camp is positioned
---
Yeah, the  commercial unsuccessful ones.
---
WV got plenty of scrap and junk
---
These aren't the only items that use a similar but wrong model in inventory view. 
---
The Enclave plasma guns use the generic plasma gun textures, likewise Ultracite lasers and Ultracite Gatling Lasers use the base generic skin as well.
---
In order to really preview them you have to equip them and go into third person view.
---
I'm glad that you're glad.
---
Kinda what I was going for! 
---
I can relate with you. I've since taken a break from the game besides to log in and check out the atom shop for any additions I may want to spend my earned  points on. Sometimes I stay for an hour or so to listen to the radio and sell to vendors. For the most part just waiting for more PVE content to be announced, or check and see if anyone I met in game and enjoyed playing with is online. Which recently being that we have all done all that is offered has be an empty online list.
---
The Flatwoods Monster DOES count as an alien for this challenge. It crosses out both Flatwoods and Alien when you kill it.
---
3rd time posting this. Spamming it wont make it better ...
---
Thanks for reminding me! I had forgotten about "An idiot abroad"!
---
It's quite the opposite. You guys are so quick with your 'people don't like it when when I feel negatively about their thing they like...'.
---
We don't like when people senselessly beat a dead fucking horse forever. 
---
Personally, the new players praising the game is REFRESHING. And I love seeing silly posts about CAMPs  and player interactions. 
---
We don't need a new sub for new players. That is this subs intended purpose. If you just want news go stay at r/Fallout with your hater friends. 
---
I would love to see MORE new players posting here and way less pieces of shit like you tbh.
---
Thank you, been using photomode quite a lot actually, really useful tool! 
---
It also makes the most satisfying potato gun noise I've ever heard.
---
Wouldn't trade my explosive harpoon for anything.
---
Is this some new trend among the millennial, where they can't handle little challenge inside game and then complain like they are being raped and bullied. I remember time when I was minor and was playing MU online, where people could go criminals and attack player where ever they wanted and no one felt like "Omg, stop bullying me!!!", instead of complaining players saw it as challenge to beat and get better at game. If game is too hard and you are feeling like being bullied, maybe stick to offline games then.
---
‚ÄúFix this Bethesda‚Äù..... Tried to read the plan before blaming the dev? They fucked up a lot in this game but I swear 50% of the complaints in here are players who don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre doing.
---
You can leave now, thanks. You clearly don't belong this sub. 
---
Hey man, I don't lockpick or break stuff, not worth that warrant. 
---
My character is like the skeezebag that rifles through your car and steals your change if you forget to lock it, but doesn't have the commitment to break your window to steal it.
---
I am talking damage per second, not the damage per shot. How many rounds do guns shoot per minute and how does that translate to damage output by second. If a minigun shoots ten rounds per second at ten damage each, it is doing 100 damage per second. If a gatling gun is shooting two rounds per second at 50 damage each, they are doing the same damage per second. This community needs to discuss guns as they relate to damage per second instead of focusing on the hard per shot number if it ever wants to hold a useful conversation.
---
I mean the more subtle abuses, for example, intentionally trying to get yourself shot to initiate real PvP. Stuff like that.
---
Dude just stop. You've been spamming this for the last 40 minutes. Nobody cares.
---
My friends are invisible too
---
Ok like just in the general range of my camp
---
I think they are bashing it because mass effect andramada was thrown under the Bus for the sake of anthems increased development 
---
I took [one](https://i.imgur.com/DQM0UKz.png) with another filter, should have added some roughage to it now that I think about it, will do next time someone nuke the place lol! 
---
I'm still waiting for a Giddyup Buttercup in a Stable 2 outfit.
---
Oh man. The explosive vents. Where do I even begin with that BS? Ive got 17 currently, learned 1, probably dumped 5-8. I just dont get it. How can this even be called a *random* number generator?
---
I want a moonshine still
---
I got one from the scorchbeastqueen. Lucky me I guess. 
---
Not everyone in the game is a duper. That 2000 steel in your stash? Shit you're a duper. Quit the game Drackar39.
---
Something, something great minds...    :)
---
I'm down. 
---
One of the best photo modes I‚Äôve seen in a game.  I typically don‚Äôt care for them in other games but the combination of how many options you have here plus seeing them as loading screen memories is fantastic.
---
And anthem is still a buggy mess and it's not even a beta hut the demo
---
Well, aren't you pleasant.
---
Let it be.
---
Well fo76 is an online only game that already makes the audience smaller so comparing online modes isnt so much cheating as using closest approximations of game type. especially when said list is used to describe something as a flop. just because it didnt flood the market doesnt make it a flop. though it could in bethesda's eyes. after all ea thought COD did poorly when it only made $500 million rather than $550 million.
---
You wont hear me argue to hard on the microtransaction front. i am very much against them in non-f2p games, but they are not pay to win.
---
the found loot boxes could just be left over code. like how EA's atheum or whatever it is called apparently had to be reworked because their loot box push blew up in their face. either way its like the free 2 play rumor. it is just bullshit speculation until bethesda makes a move. if they go actually put loot boxes in I think it would cause a bigger backlash than their nylon bags.  
---
When they are marked as favorite does the little heart still show up in the shop?
---
Set up in some Raider PA and get a fat man. Cosplay the guy from Fo4 on the bridge in Lexington. 
---
Why would you do that though? Just to be a dick? Are you that sad in your real life?
---
I‚Äôd just like to know how the Census violence event in Cranberry bog still hasn‚Äôt been fixed yet. It‚Äôs literally been over two months. Or was their just so many bugs that they still haven‚Äôt gotten to this one yet? I feel like I‚Äôm at the DMV being told to take a number theirs so many damn bugs. I‚Äôm tired of spending caps/perk points on something just for it to either not work or for Bethesda to go back and change something making it a waste of points/caps. Needless to say I‚Äôll be glad when Crackdown 3 or Anthem releases.
---
Let he that is without sin, cast thy first stone.
---
50 caps + flowers for the lot.
---
It's not that I need the science perk cards, it's just not appearing at all in the modification menu for any of the mod slots
---
I certainly can be.
---
Lmaooooo 
---
You get it from finishing the brotherhood quest line 
---
For me there's always one that won't rez when I try to place it, and I have to go through a ritual of dropping it, climbing into it, stashing any other chassis' I might be carrying (or else "collect" fails too after I exit), and exiting and collecting it. Sometimes I get lucky and the auto-return timer collects it, but something the auto-return fails too. The final 10 seconds go by and the chassis remains uncollected.
---
I don't think it's the same chassis' each time, like there's an off-by-one bug somewhere affecting when you have multiple. I've also sometimes had the wrong chassis return to inventory when I collect one.
---
Banned players can create new accounts. Rgd5impact, a exploit youtuber, got banned 7 times. There will always be someone that tries to break the game only way to stop it is to ban ip addresses. Most supers used a separate account and knew that the account would get banned and would unload the stuff to a separate account. This has been going on since the beginning of online gaming. Always cheaters even popular youtube stars got caught cheating on live streams. 
---
On a separate note I feel like stash limits weren't an issue in other games and rarely affected the servers (I could be completely wrong here). The real problem is they took a solo player engine and crammed it into multiplayer platform. Almost every glitch in fallout 4 worked in fallout 76. If the company created a new engine specific to multiplayer I feel things wouldn't be as bad. On top of that many computer entries talks about bethesda not creating a new engine and would be a huge problem. If a dev new this would be an issue before release and raised the alarm the ivory tower completely ignored it. 
---
Last thought here. Why is bethesda using this 8 year old engine  for the new star field game. Bad on bethesda should have created a new multiplayer engine for both games. Like the entries in the terminals state should have spent more money developing a new engine than to spend it on failed pr stunts that probably cost them more money in the long run. Cant wait to hear about leather jacket they are selking!
---
You missing Charred Scorchbeast Liver under specials. I use that a lot
---
I might have my quests wrong here, but i think it‚Äôs either part of the main quest or part of the BoS quest. I got the same thing around the same level as you. 
---
People in this sub probably won't mind. They seem to go along with anything.
---
either of you manage to fix the issue?
---
You're assuming they'll even give you the opportunity to kill people within x radius of the Vault or before they are a certain level.
---
Have you tried leaving the area and coming back? That is about all i could think of short of relogging.
---
You have no change to survive make your time. 
---
it's a shame that the question is even there, people like you should be able to sell what they farmed no problem, but because it was possible to dupe in the first place there is now a cloud of doubt over any transaction...
---
Yes! I am always scared of a disconnection happening and me losing a set.  They really need to implement some sort of identification in our stash/inventory, so we don't have to pull them all out just to apply a mod/repair to the one we wanted. Looking at you u/lonevaultwanderer to hopefully pass this on as it's been a repetitive post in this community.

if you‚Äôve done the brotherhood quests then it‚Äôs normal, it‚Äôs a reward from the quest in fort defiance. if you havent done that, then i have no idea where it could‚Äôve come from

Several I‚Äôm Summersville

Why does it matter if it didn‚Äôt make your list of top 20 games?
---
Yes this happened to me yesterday. I gave it about 5 minutes, tried every button that would work (ie, map). Had to quit the server. 
---
I own the game, I've played until level 119, and I'd like to know what's going on with it.
---
Explain to me why I don't belong here?
---
10/10 would pay 500 atoms for increased storage
---
How does it take things?
---
in a year? maybe not. in a month? this sub freaks out when the inside the vault isnt post when expected.
---
ah ty
---
The obsession level with these types is baffling. Shitposting on a game forum = saving the world from insanity. *To the keyboard, for great justice!*
---
That sentence is a buggy mess.
---
Id at least like dirty versions of the stuff in the atom shop like the posters and lights have.
---
I don‚Äôt know what list you are looking at but in november 76 was in the top 5 not even counting digital sales 
---
Report him for spamming...
---
Or the notes written by a child where the same horrifically drawn letters repeat so obviously throughout the note and just looks stupid.
---
If you are on Xbox I got ya covered. Not duped. I apparently have stupid good luck with them. Best tips I can give is run the golf course once and then move on to other places like watoga, uranium fever if it's up, and workshop areas and hope for legendary enemies, another good tip is let their health drop to half on 2 * enemies and above and then let it refill before you punch their head off, then check the loot with the menu. I've noticed from extensive tests that this does work in better loot drops. 
---
Such hate, man.
---
Not really.
---
Anything over level 50 is meaningless since all gear is capped and you receive no additional perk slots or bonus stats.
---
And the game has REALLY HARSH level scaling.  The level 6 could probably one shot the level 121 in the head with a pipe revolver.
---
And on top of that a majority of people including me are boycotting it because one of the devs (now ex dev xD) was bashing on a popular game critic that they hated, hours after it was announced he was dead.
---
Because you only want news about game changes. The sub caters towards players, interactions, guides, new players asking where things are and how hey work, camp builds, funny screenshots. 
---
You made it sound like people praising the game angers you, and that you are strictly interested game change news. 
---
Well, this isn't a "wrong" viewpoint, but it very much depends on the gamer. I'm used to games like 7 Days to Die, where your objective is just whatever you feel like doing. To that end, there's a lot of places to explore and new plans to find to unlock things for my C.A.M.P., so I haven't become bored yet even at level 110 (achieved organically, not through metagaming).
---
I'd take a furious 10mm or pipe pistol over any of the nocturnal rolling pins or cloaking wooden armor I wind up with, lol.
---
Your build description sorta sounds like what I‚Äôm going for. I‚Äôm about to be lvl 45. Care to share your SPECIAL stats? I‚Äôve kinda been poking around unsure of what to do to save myself from having to respec too much once I reach 50. 
---
We‚Äôve heard your feedback and will soon be rolling out some new items like:
---
- Super Serious Ez Bake Rad Oven
---
- Ultralite Ultraserious Wasteland Kids Robot Armor Paint
---
- Mega Serious Adult Molemen coloring books
---
Each item will cost between 1000-2000 atomic points, discounted from their normal price of 3000-5000 atomic shop points.  
---
We say Normal because although we alone control the prices, and these items have never before appeared, Normal is a word that exists.  As is Discount.  Hope that helps.
---
I did too!!! I love it. I think it‚Äôs hysterically out of place. 
---
It‚Äôs more about making sure more &amp; more game developers don‚Äôt try to pull stuff like this in the future or that‚Äôs it for gaming, unless you don‚Äôt mind paying full price for Alpha state games.
---
Awesome! GT: Immolatedrose lvl 82 üòÑ
---
What is the point of a turret farm there?  Is it really to just be a dick? or is there something I am missing?
---
The insult to injury is that they appear to be truly useless.  I have jumped off the top of buildings in watoga near robots, scorched, etc, and they suffer zero damage. Zero.
---
Hmmmm i wonder what it would be like in real life if we was all in the same situation as our character in fallout76?  Would there be raiders? This is a online apocalyptic survival multiplayer game. Bethesda wanted it to feel like there was real risk without completely pissing off everyone. a game where  pve players and pvp players could co-exist.
---
In normal mode they really did cater to the pve players, most of the map is pve.
---
I do think it is a dick move to continuously follow others around and prevok them. I dont agree with that type of game play but it is going to happen some people are asssholes Just like in real life. So server jump and get over it. Although normal mode will definitely improve for the pve players when survival mode is released. We just got to many players at end game with nothing to do but look for pvp. 
---
WORKSHOPS: OMFG im so sick of hearing about the cry babies.... he took my workshop QQ im low lvl im just trying to get resources. Or they have a workshop but they only port over and loot once an hour. Hey if your not smart enough to put your loot in your stash box periodically it is your own fault you lost it. You know the risk. Hello people junk drops all over the freaking map go explore you will find what you need. If there is a specific resource you need freaking google the drop locations. Workshops is a PVP location do you not understand that? You shouldn't even be taking workshops at low lvl unless you have a group to help you defend it or unless you want pvp then please do, but know it is at your own risk. Most players dont take workshops from you to be an asshole or a griefer most high lvls dont need or care about your junk. They just simply looking for pvp. I bet if you actually tried to fight back try and take it back and failed a couple times most would give the workshop back to you if you was cool about it. Hey bro you got me good i tryed my best you overpower me. im not wanting to pvp anymore any chance you will give me the workshop back?  We was promised pvp when they sold us the game. Workshops is our pvp stomping grounds. Workshops should be defended and attacked with friends. It is PVP with some risk and reward. Im lvl 120 im not looking to kill a lvl 30 at a workshop but i have no idea if there is a couple lvl 150 in your group with 2 shot explosive weapons so yes i will come take your workshop and see what kind of defense you have. Ill also give it back if you ask me nicely. Most likely ill even hook you up with lots of cool stuff.
---
YOUR HOUSE: I personally almost never attack other players houses, i have accidentally a few times killing mobs. My house is at White Springs i want you to attack my house. Then i got a reason to kill you üòä. My house is built in a way that it doesn't pose alot of risk for me. The house system is not so bad, stop crying. Its not that expensive to fix. Knowing that you play in a game where others can attack your house maybe be a little smarter about how you build it and where you place it. If you need ideas google it or mail me personally id be happy to give you some tips. The problems that all you pve players are having with what you call griefers will be pretty much resolved in march with the new survival mode.
---
Guess What pve players WORKSHOPS IS A PVP ZONE.
---
So if you dont want pvp then stay out of them.
---
PS im really going to flip out if you all join survival mode and cry about others killing you and taking your loot.
---
I'm sorry, but I don't see your name on the moderator list. Where do you get the idea that you're the one who can say what the sub is for and what it's not for?
---
&gt;	Today I didn‚Äôt even have to use my hand-made
---
Is it still that bad? 
---
A huge difference here is he developers are already working on bugs and have a communication going between devs and players. It took a long time for Bethesda to get this on top of things. 
---
Give us the ability to view emotes before buying 
---
Apparently you don't drink at the same hole in walls I do
---
2-3 hours in and already jumping to an opinion and dismissing others. Great job
---
You know what‚Äôs really sad? The atom shop cowboy hat looks worse than the in-game ‚Äúblack cowboy hat.‚Äù I know because I wasted challenge atoms on it to compare. :-(
---
I already have the level 50 All rise, I was just wondering if the perks were random or not. 
---
Im pretty sure any mod exists for all PA types, except for the jetpack, thats exclusive to t45 t51 t60 and x01
---
No to fix something that is dumb and shouldn't be allowed. Obviously this has you worried and you see the possibility to be exploited
---
I don't think anyone gets to form an opinion at level 1. Give it time before you say one way or the other
---
Wait a minute hold the phone...
---
there's a black cowboy hat!? WHERE?!
---
I just want to be able to play the "Frame Drum" or "Mouth Harp" at my camp. Frame drum can be found at the Welch train station in The Ash Heap, and when I lived in The Mire I really wanted to just sit and play  one for ambiance sake.
---
The jet Pak mod. Which I should've written but assume it's too late because it's now gone
---
I‚Äôm bored of the game. I‚Äôll be putting it down when Anthem &amp; Crackdown 3 release and won‚Äôt be picking it back up. Especially with all the good titles coming out this year. 
---
"let's play!"
---
me: nah im not buying that
---
buys it
---
I added in a clue. It took a little figuring out by I've sent you to the area you need to be. Explore and try and place your camp
---
Im sure they knew PA mods would be desireable so they made them rare in order to encourage interaction. Want calibrated shocks? Find someone one who can craft them for you. Its better than hopping servers a hundred times
---
It literally says "workshop objects." That perk is obviously intended for workshops, not player camps. 
---
I can get on board with griefing to bring attention to a glaring game issue for sure. 
---
Not just for the sake of being a prick and trolling new players though. 
---
I starting building a radio station using the Galaxy News Network material from the game, I had this same idea , I even had a buddy who would fast travel to other players and tell me what they were doing and I would report it as news lol its alot of fun and people got into it was a blast
---
Thanks for the info guys I have over 50 treasure maps multiple of the same one as well if somebody‚Äôs interest to join me in a treasure hunt I‚Äôm on Xbox 
---
GT. manny sandov 
---
Bought patriot CA paint... regret.
---
I help guys out all the time. Just today a 71 went wanted at my camp while I was inside bulking, could have easily just went and laid him out but he was shooting the mutants and stray bullet I guess. I told him to come inside, fried him up but that didn't work so killed him and let him get his bag. But when your in the 200 level range, grinding gets to you xD. You end up playing around with things like this [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QW8uPZClww](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QW8uPZClww)
---
I dunno what bethesda is talking about. My trap relies on greed so I don't feel so bad!
---
Fuck this guy can we get him banned yet? 
---
It got better admittedly
---
There is no end game. If you think there is your missing the point. 
---
TSE really only good for the adds/mobs that come in waves from the queen. Queen herself has a huge debuff to explosives so TSE's do lil to no damage to her most of the time. just an fyi..   
---
i do more damage to her faster with my TS handmade seeing chunks of health come off vs. my TSE shotgun not moving the health bar at all.
---
fast kill would be a mix, with the TSE people covering the ground adds helping keep players running TS and AA weapons eyes on the queen.  TSE just need to tag her to get on the loot list but are better used as crowd control.
---
The thing a lot of people give the game flak for wasnt even related to the game, things like the canvas bag fiasco, the data leak and the nuka rum bottle, they were 3 major tbings people complained about and gave the game bad reviews for it, even though they have 0 impact on the actual game itself
---
Sure, I'm not near my PC now but will reply later this evening.  FWIW I'm over 300 now and have experimented with quite a few variations, including min/max.  The one I post for ya is the best balanced one I have that steamrolls without overkill and allows a couple of quality of life perks.
---
&gt;devs (now ex dev xD) was bashing on a popular game critic that they hated, hours after it was announced he was dead.
---
You're passing on a game because one of the many devs who was fired did something on social media? I'm not hating or nothin, its your wallet &amp; money. But I gotta say, that's a pretty odd reason to boycott a game.
---
So many missed oppertunities in 76. Small things that would have had serious improvemental outcomes
---
People think it helps
---
Yeah I read that. Oh go ahead bethesda and just remove loot drops altogether, kill the only thing I have left to do in this game! 
---
I‚Äôll put on the expedition hat and start searching! Thanks :)
---
Haha this gave me a good laugh. Good satire,  OP.
---
Didn‚Äôt they say they‚Äôre increasing stash sizes already? And isn‚Äôt it going to be free like the first increase?
---
The title of the terminals page is gold!
---
Well, you didn't read any part of my post seemingly, you were a total cunt in every part of your response and again when called out on being an idiot..   You a champ!
---

---
This lol
---
It'd give me something to spend my atoms on since most of the stuff in the shop is overpriced or just terrible.
---
I always thought the paints buffing PA was silly (no offense) and liked the idea of a separate material and paint option, but I'd just like to see more paints (and some love for the Raider Power Armor)
---
What platform? I can make a bunch of them.   
---
Ultracite armor does not have a Jetpack MOD, same as Raider and Excavator.
---
Respec. It is a lot easier and you don‚Äôt have to waste time grinding levels on a new character. I‚Äôve had to respec once or twice and trust me, it‚Äôs easier than restarting a character
---
None taken. Lol Just want MORE customization.

Why are you telling me this?  Why does your beef with their graphics engine come up?

It would be the best pvp outfit ever.

I want a tiara too.

Welcome to the world basically. Run by sociopaths

Atom cats and shark paint. My two favorites
---
I'm not for one second saying FO76 was successful, but there are plenty of games that did well. 
---
Just a list of 20 is only ever going to be a list of 20 isn't it. I'm sure 21 - 30 in the list did just fine financially.
---
But seriously, this is an awful idea imho
---
&gt;   Want calibrated shocks?  Find someone one who can craft them for you. 
---
Except in the case of X01 armor, I don't even think that's possible. 
---
X01 calibrated shocks ONLY appear as a mod in the Enclave vendor- around .1 percent of the time. 
---
Secondly, how are you supposed to find the people who craft them?  One should not have to go to reddit to find people able to do such things.
---
Bethesda is the game maker, so they are the ones who should provide the means with putting players in touch for each other if they have to desire to trade. 
---
No, I don't play solo- yes I have played with teams many times and not a single person on any team I have ever played with has ever found plans for calibrated shocks or is able to craft them.   
---
So if your interaction theory is true, the are requiring you to interact while not giving you a means to interact with them.   Bethesda's 'player trading post' is said to be in the works, but as of now, it's only an idea, and it provides zero help. 
---

---
You're not sure because you're level 1.
---
And I suspect you're trolling.
---
Thanks! I keep trying to read about the respec how does it work exactly I can't really find a good explanation of it. 
---
I love my Princess Castle Bed.
---
You posted an utterly useless and easily searchable question. I gave you the answer you deserved man. 
---
Nice build!
---
IIRC: Only Aluminium and Lead provide a small weigh savings when bulked.
---
The purpose of bulking items is to sell them. 'Unbulkable' items (Circuits, Gold Scrap, etc) can be sold as is.
---
Haaaha!
---
By level 75, you should have an almost perfect special point and perk setup. 
---
If you go down to Survey Camp Alpha there is an anti air missile launcher thing that wrecks scorchbeasts, stand by it and shoot along side it and when she breaks just fix it quick
---
A myth
---
The first "bug" may be from you trying to fire while its reloading. That will stop the reload to get a shot off incase you needed one more shot to finish off an enemy. Probably only works with certain weapons as well.
---
I said demo. 
---
It is satire.
---
Same boat buddy, no room in End. Be sure to keep your distance, and consider investing in Marsupial to help you keep your distance from targets haha
---
Good luck, and don't sweat a few darwin awards, I've got heaps because of explosives
---
Do you not know about starched genes, or are you to low level to get it? 
---
What platform are you on? We sell serums cheap on xbx1. 
---
The spot where you put the ingredients in. It usually only shows the ingredients, but sometimes for an odd reason your armor/weapon will appear and will let you put it in, but won‚Äôt let you take it out. So if you are trying to spam click stuff into the box you‚Äôll accidentally click your armor before you realize.
---
Lmfao. He He your the type of player i aso like to kill.
---
But yea why these peeps crying over a little junk its not like you cant find more. 
---
In my opinion, Perk Loadout Manager is a classic example of solving a problem before it's really understood (or, probably more accurately, solving a problem without complete access to the environment). It's a kludge that absolutely makes things *better*, but only partially solves the problem and creates it's own issues.
---
You'll remember that Perk Loadout Manager was initially released supporting three loadouts. Then it became clear that there were more scenarios were custom builds were required, now it supports eight. If you include combat scenarios (melee, using different weapon types, etc.) there may as many as 12-16 distinct card loadouts that a true micromanager might want.
---
You'll also be creating "full" loadouts when any single scenario will rarely need more than two or three changes.
---
The manager allows for loadouts to be hot-keyed - which made sense when it supported three; now with eight, hot-keys are a much less elegant solution. Most players will likely end up cycling once they create more than three or four.
---
Because the loadouts are static, there's significantly more management if you use this in the early game. S.P.E.C.I.A.L. points and cards are changing every level and the static loadouts won't adapt this to in any way. Later in the game, this may be less of an issue, but it remains an issue.
---
Finally, and most importantly, it still requires you to pull out of the game to manually manage your skills. Find a safe - pull out, easily change your loadout, go back, pick the safe, then reverse the whole process. The Perk Loadout Manager streamlines a broken process that *shouldn't exist at all*.
---
By contrast, a system like the one I've outlined the system separates the management of skills from gameplay; the player is able to retain immersion while the system contextually manages its configuration automatically. Any conditions - and any number of conditions - that the game recognizes would able to be included in the system without forcing the player to remember or cycle through them each time. Also, only those cards specific to each condition would need to be managed.  Because loadouts aren't static, the system adapts to change and you'll be faced with tweaking sessions less often.
---
A supported loadout manager like Perk Loadout Manager would absolutely be better than what we have, but it would still be a far cry from what it could be.
---
It's really good. The Last of Us had a similar photomode which I also enjoyed!
---
No idea why you were downvoted. This is indeed a Zetan.
---
I‚Äôm on PC, I was hoping to run across the plans for Overdrive servos 
---
Optimized bracers
---
Reactive plates
---
For ultracite power armor during a future sbq fight
---
This is only to bring attention to a glaring issue. Not sure why you'd think I'm a dick..... If I was a griefer I'd have never posted this I would've quietly waited untill they used us a hamsters in thier next experiment then ruined it for everyone
---
You can buy serums for 500 caps max, end game players can craft them
---
I agree. Although you can get the good with salt perk. It still helps.
---
I‚Äôve got it at a first level perk card. So it only had a decreased chance to not get cured. I‚Äôm looking forward to that second level perk card!
---
Haha  very true. 
---
Oh damn, I‚Äôd never considered that but with it being a cult thing that def would make sense... maybe a strange Mothman ritual suicide type deal like drinking the kool-aid. üòÇüòµ
---
That happens to be the platform I‚Äôm playing on! 
---
For Indie, sure. For big Triple-A titles of long established franchises... no.
---
I love that you can see the blast wave
---
I thought the pc copy didn't come with a disk?? 
---
 oK. Perhaps some misconceptions here. There are 3 Combat Armors. Heavy, Sturdy and just Combat Armor or really Light Combat Armor.
---
 The BOS mods work on all of em but applying the BOS Chest mod to Heavy Combat Armor is far different from doing that to Combat Armor.
---
Here, have a few hundred copies of explosive vents instead.
---
I got lucky and someone traded me t51 calibrated shock plans. I dont have the plans for any other PAs, im always looking at phoenix to see if they show up. I see the mods every so often, managed to get 2 for t60, and one for excavator
---
Yup, they‚Äôre dead to me after what they did to Andromeda.
---
he never showed up, but the offer still stands. probably he managed to get one.
---
Are those serums at Whitesprings? I haven‚Äôt been inside yet. 
---
Get the second starched genes and we will sell them to you 100c each. Don‚Äôt pay more than 200 for sure. 
---
It‚Äôs in the lower floor of the whitespring golf club on a wheelchair
---
after 50 when you level you get a choice, choose a card or move a point. not really much to it.
---
Yes please! They make me feel so blind! 
---
Cool! I‚Äôll hit you up as soon as I get that second one! Thanks. 
---
Rare items are rare enough said.
---
I really want the option to use purified water in recipes. 
---
It makes no sense to ONLY use boiled water. 
---
Yes. This is a concept that rather than increasing across the board risking destabilization, it offers those actually invested into the game increased stash space. That's why we only went from 400 to 600 the first time. 
---
Go get yourself rank 2 of the perk starched genes, with that equipped you cant gain but most importantly LOSE mutations, so farm the ones you want, or buy some serums, then equip that annnd youre all set :)
---
I highly recommend marsupial, the jumping completely changes the gameplay, and healing factor, youll have too many stims spare in no time.
---
1) Xbox one x
---
2) oOo hokuloac oOo
---
3) Will you ever be implementing a way to track which plans and recipes your character knows? I've wasted so many caps buying duplicate recipes I was sure I didn't know. Some of the items also have vague descriptions or no description at all.
---
Also frustrating that many things being tracked in my challenges don't seem to be working. I've learned dozens and dozens of recipes and in my challenges I'm still at 2 of 76.
---
Do a search here if you want to read what people think about it. Multiple posts with 1000+ votes pointing how ridiculous the nerf is. The best suggestion that kept getting brought up was to disallow those two effects to be on the same weapon.
---
Ah, trolling.   The child's game that was already old 20 years ago.
---
I just got it, man it looks so much better than the Atom Shop one... wish I knew about it before I wasted atoms...
---
&gt; Here, have a few hundred copies of explosive vents instead. 
---
You make the RNG gods look so stingy with your generosity.  Thanks kind sir. 
---
You just get to either choose 1 new perk card you don't have yet every level, or move a special point from one to another (eg strength to agility)
---
So it's just a matter of developing your new skill set (there are tools online to set up your ideal special and perk cards), figuring out how many special points need to move, and which perk cards you need to get.
---
You will still get a pack of perk cards every few levels (every 5 I think?) So that helps some with the perk cards
---
In theory it should just get easier to respec as you level higher because eventually you will have all the perk cards and just need to move special points.
---
Yea but they're about 4000 caps each sooo yea
---
I just put my camp here for this exact view.
---
PC as well.   
---
I've got a couple hundred hours in just obtaining PA plans, so take or leave the following.  
---
Basically most of those plans can only be obtained as super rare drops from Treasure maps or the Queen herself,  the Reactive plates and Optimized bracers are both fairly prized.   
---
I do have a spare Overdrive servos for trade and happy to plan swap.  
---
Yup, still haven‚Äôt seen X-01 shocks or jet pack and I refuse to server hop farm.  Also haven‚Äôt seen T-51b of either.  T-60 and Excavator shocks I‚Äôve seen both like 6 times so for me they seem far more common.  I can craft T-60 jet pack even now but I think that was a low Luck chance grab other day.
---
Yup, sounds like bobble heads 
---
YIKES
---
Some idiot was mocking my Excavator armor tge other day while sporting a Playtime paintjob and trying to harass me into PVP.  The adults with minds of 1st graders are quite entertaining.
---
did you have a factory? 
---
She could have started the pvp from capturing the factory
---
or
---
Do you have that electic charged mutation?
---
She could have melee attacked u and that procs and initiates pvp
---
That's dumb.. Why even have them as two seperate challenges. 
---
I think after this next patch this will be my new QoL demand.  I‚Äôm a lot more careful now but shit happens, I sold some of my weapons multiple times first few weeks of the game, it sucks.
---
Get starched genes maxed and you can keep them all (and class freak to make them all pretty worthwhile). Farm one or two and buy the rest from players (cheap) or the whitespring bunker (expensive).
---
I've only farmed one. By chance I got "speed demon" by drinking the toxic water in the whitespring spa. Then I bought marsupial, healing factor, and twisted muscles.
---
I hate that guy... He ruined my survival progress.
---
 I have found them. Looked at 4 and bought 2 and now have quite a few Handmade mods unlocked. The gun is very good and my alt will be pleased as well when she gets her plans.
---
 You are confused. ;)
---
Agreed. also excavator please üòÉ even just some other bright safety colors would be cool, like hazard orange and neon green
---
Never buy them from vendors, save your caps! Others players are who you should buy them off 
---
They are not tameable. 
---
Why have pacifist mode if they can destroy camps?  Pacifist mode should apply to camps since there is no penalty for being a griefer.
---
100% this!
---
Just plug in a mic. I may talk to you but I'll be gentle. ;)
---
There's a mod for PC, but nothing for console unfortunately 
---
I have the same issue, like I can't repair anything quickly as I'm missing 1 corn...wtf
---
I‚Äôd like to see the loading screen feature in more games! Great pic op
---
Yo BGS, if you wanna make fuckin bank, add the NCR Veteran Ranger outfit to the shop. Yeah, itbreaks the lore, but people would be alllll over that shit
---
I won't edit because I like your comment lol
---
Look at all the people justifiying that they flew through the story to the end of the game and are bored but dont want to admit this game is a shallow hull so they buy TSE weapons from dupers then get on reddit and complain how dupers are ruining the game and then run around killing everything in site because they have no skill in any actual FPS because you cant cheat to unlock the weapons in a normal pvp fueled fps.
---
"Im a raider."  Thats what they call assholes nowadays huh?
---
This entire community is ass backwards, its even sadder bethesda reads this shit in this sub and counts this as a form of "feedback."
---
You guys have fun with that endless loot grind for junk, killing the SBQ and getting shit loot over and over and over only to grind 5 hours to make up for the waste of resources. 
---
Justify your purchase and actions however you want, real gamers know dipshits when we see them.
---
&gt; is "favorably" bugged  
---
Why is it considered a bug or even favourable, as the damage output drops as you use the weapon dulling the edge *so to speak* unlike weapons that use ammunition that are duplicate units. So it seems to me logical that melee weapons will wear out some as they are used and will output less damage until *sharpened*.
---
Not complaining, I just have to keep on top of the repairs to keep my damage at near max and not forget to swap in **Makeshift Warrior**. Uses materials but then my knives use no ammunition.
---
Respec will always be faster.
---
Once I hit level 50 I stopped to figure out what I needed to reach my perfect build which will take until somewhere in the mid 70's.
---
Sounds perfect tbh. 
---
I dont see it, weird. whats yr ign
---
Im gonna say no to micro transactions stash space. It should be larger in the first place. We shouldn't be paying for that. I remember that marvel heroes games had extra stash space for cash... That game was closed down.
---
I did not. 
---
You should probably research game and script engines. Wow you really think game engines only run graphics.
---
It's in beta now? So it will be on shelves next week?
---
This is exactly what I've been needing. I've been forming a spreadsheet, so this is a vast improvement. Thanks for the great work dude. 
---
But it works on camps
---
Yes, but plasma now breaks extremely fast, while laser is the more usable one. Mowing down weaker enemies with gatling laser is great, but not very viable against strong enemies.
---
Plasma will break after a reload or two so it's unusable, just in a different way now. 
---
I have found 1 for T-45 and 1 for T-60 in all my time looking through vendors. Every once in a while people make fun of me for still using excavator armor but what else am I supposed to do when I'm scavenging? üòÖ
---
Well I had a workshop, but I wasn't there (if that's what you meant by factory?).  I do have a junk extractor in my CAMP, but I am not sure how that would play in.  I don't believe the workshop was under attack, and I didn't attack it.  Also, I do have electric charged but I wasn't attacked prior.. just dead.
---
So yay, bobbleheads ftl I guess.  I'd log a ticket, but I'd only get a canned response, and no action.
---
Here's the map I use:
---
m.uk.ign.com/maps/fallout-76/appalachia
---
I have never gotten anything other than one star from anything other than killing a creature
---
Dont worry, you'll eventually get to the point everyone else did.
---
It's just the demo. Two days. That's it. I think the release is early next month. 
---
Good to hear! 
---
I‚Äôve found as many as three there and picked them up one by one to turn in. 17 caps to fast travel to Fort Defiance with Travel agent. 25 caps for turning in. 
---
What if you smear some grime on the princess bed?
---
I don't know why you would do this. Just respec your character after level 50. Seems like a waste of time unless you are going to just use the OG character as a mule.
---
I'm a player and I never asked for serious items. I like the silliness the Atom shop brings. In fact I want more. There's enough serious outfits already, let the Atom Store be for fun.
---
Side note to Bethseda, I could use more clean cloth outfits in the shop, my sweater vest is getting frayed.
---
You contracted The Blight.
---
I've noticed that I get and additional 100 carry weight when I log in while wearing the power armor. The extra weight goes away when you exit the pa.
---
To get the buff back, just go into you pa and leave the server then log back in. You'll have that buff again.
---
If you owned a workshop anywhere on the map you are open season for PvP ANYWHERE on the map. It very likely his buddy just contested the workshop as he walked up to you.
---
There is a list of items that will be released in the Atom shop. All the items are ready but they release them slowly just to make us think they are releasing new content. Go check the list and remember what you wanna buy. Maybe save up atoms.
---
Remember, everything will cost more than you think they will.
---
One star only here
---
If your viable/unviable is on a scale one-shots/everything else then yeah, will suck for you. 
---
Is there a way to tell it what ingredients I already have and have it suggest recipes based on that?
---
*"xXxm0thm4n dropped a nuke in your area"*
---
I've done that a few times and nothing happens. I'll figure something out.
---
When was the last time u tried the machine? 
---
I built a house the other day and i thought we had glass roofs so i built it with the intention of putting a glass "dome" type thing on the roof, only to look and remember it was FO4 that had the glass roofs
---
Did u try recently or the last patch?
---
I used all my atoms to convert my camp into a restaurant featuring vault-tec tables and asphalt!
---
That's just what I do and it works for me. Maybe it depends on the console.
---
i do it all the time. She did capture the workshop but cancelled. She spotted you on the map before doing this and fast travelled to ur location.
---
Nope, sat there testing it and just reloaded over and over. Shot off one round every time
---
I‚Äôd reload until i switched the gun. This has happened to me on 3 separate occasions. 
---
I guessing the idea was that they were going to use the player vending machines to have the players sell the desireable items to other players in the game, there was probobly going to be some way to reveal your camp to other players to encourage this, obviously the player vending feature wasnt in the final version of the game so player interaction isnt at its fullest, and everyone has very different experiences so just because you havent found a person who can craft them doesnt mean other people havent, i got the t-60 calibrated shocks plans at around level 50ish, im like level 170 now, crafted shocks for people on my friends list before
---
6k here.. bought some icons and the Xmas power armor. Regretting a few that I've passed up but I'm waiting for more quality hairstyles and better skins.
---
Doesn't ESO have a thing you can buy that's a bag that gives you unlimited space for crafting items?
---
I would use my atoms for that, but for unlimited junk storage. 
---
Yeah we read that 50 fucking times like you did before we scrolled down here thanks pal.
---
Thank you, yeah I love when they pop up randomly during loading screens! 
---
I might do the same in the near future! 
---
Right after they fix the server stability and duping.
---
Todd Howard, in an interview, said that the Only reason players are able to damage player camps is to prevent people building impenetrable prisons to trap other players. 
---
No, you went out of your way to be an asshole while ignoring all of what I said.  You are literally every 10 year old on the internet.
---
And if theyre in your stored you can place tgem down even if your over your camp budget, effectibely giving you a much larger camp
---
We once organized like 12 people to storm through silos, and on the very first one a rando swept in and dropped the nuke off the NW edge of the map ü§¶ None of us noticed him in amoung us because there were already so many of us running around in the chaos ü§£
---
Fair enough!
---
I know that feeling man, I bought the clean purifier, glow in the dark map, mini mushroom cloud lamp and the red pipboy Paint
---
Wahhhhh! I want the same stuff we've had for 12 years. Wahhhhh!!
---
So erm a list of 20 titles should include more than 20 titles?
---
This won‚Äôt be an atom shop item; it looks like something from Fallout.
---
That's a load of bullshit from him and you should've realized that a month ago
---
I‚Äôll double nuke your house too, you boingus. 
---
If you scrap the plant and put it back again you'll be able to use repair all
---
 He first followed me way up north. Now I'm west of Watoga, a long way from anything to do with him.
---
 Its not a real problem, he goes down right away.
---
That's pretty good idea
---
What build were you running? Cause level 30 shotgun build can take 60 level enemies with few problems.
---
Heavy gets good when you can use the gatling gun.
---
Auto rifles have handmade around that level.
---
Single shot sniper builds are great every level.
---
No idea about pistols, tried them for a new character hated all of them. 
---
I mean, FO1&amp;2 on the Xbox will be pretty sweet... But is that what's happening?
---
Focus efforts elsewhere to avoid fixing problems? I don't get it either.
---
He first followed me way up north. Now I'm west of Watoga, a long way from anything to do with him.
---
Its not a real problem, he goes down right away.
---
+1
---
For anyone who thinks they have something new to contribute to this concept: go over to /r/thedivision and dig through the threads about rogue behavior. Just because the game allows you to be an asshole doesn't mean you aren't still an asshole.
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm gonna do. I‚Äôm gonna kill and eat players, extort them for caps, sell chems, and generally be a nuisance. 
---
But I‚Äôll also be nice afterward. 
---
You guys still load in? Lmao.
---
Realistically, i think its because the salty horrible to play with people have chosen to just slag the game off online instead of play it, so the assholes self filtered themselves out leaving only the people who actually like and or want to play the game in it
---
i was late to the fallout 76 party as well and wanted to make a thread singing the games praises at level 5 too.  just couldn't understand the hate.  enjoy what you're feeling now while it lasts and take your time with the game, because once your character is set up thats pretty much it
---
West of Watoga is not his part of the world.
---
Only thing that I ever really wanted was the Blackbird paint for power armor, but It was only a limited time release and I couldn't amount the atoms in the limited time.
---
Since then I've been stockpiling atoms hoping one day it or something cooler shows up in the shop, so far... now luck, only pink beds and toy paints...
---
Four of us have a weekly play night on PC. On average it takes us fifteen minutes of trying to get all four of us on the same team and in the same world. Even when we manage that we still have times when some people will be invisible to other members of the party. I have never played a multiplayer game that made it so hard to get a team going. Imagine trying to put together a raid group in this game . . . .
---
All guns create heat. 
---
Yes!!! So annoying 
---
Same thing here, been through about 15 servers today on Xbox. A lot of the time the 100 carry weight doesn‚Äôt come back right away for me either, even on multiple servers.
---
Workshops do that.
---
I can walk up to your workshop, start claiming and not stop which doesn't notify you.
---
Then come to your house and level it to the ground.
---
Yeah we need mods who can ban you from posting based on opinions and views conflicting with there's just like every other sub on reddit.
---
 THat sucks, My only legendary Lever action is a Bloodied, I use it mostly since I won't accidentally scrap it.  I suppose there are builds Bloodied are good for, but it is not mine.  
---
Lol oh yeah? Destroying player camps Must be an intended mechanic then, despite game mechanics actively designed to punish that behavior and a lack of any rewards other than the satisfaction of being a dick.
---
Your ideas are awesome and I'd pay full retail for a game you've described. You've obviously put a lot of heart into it, which is what a lot of devs lack these days. 
---
calling someone a baby when you have no actual counterpoints is not the way to enforce your stance.
---
Thats good. Literally do abything else when this happens and you're golden.
---
1 shot to the fusion core will insta-kill any sentry, don‚Äôt bother shooting at it at all until it goes into cool down mode.
---
Wow that's actually awesome!  :)
---
Thanks for sharing a positive experience, thanks for joining us! Welcome!
---
Role playing is practically part of the game. If I‚Äôm not allowed to be a raider that orders you to supply me with plastic forks or else, then I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm playing this game. 
---
Have you not seen the trailer?
---
I agree. Rejuvenated 2 grants 70% disease res, and Antibiotics negates the Radaway debuff. With this combo 15 antibiotics (~4 lbs) will last multiple sessions, and they're a breeze to farm if you swap in Super Duper/Chemist/Pharmacist. Or you could probably even get enough with just Pharma Farma.
---
If you really struggle with carry weight after level 50 then you are either hording too much, or you simply haven't mastered some of the game mechanics yet. I don't use power armor or deep pocket mods and I carry 5 weapons (~70 lbs) mostly rifles. It's a relatively difficult build in terms of carry weight, yet all I need is Marsupial and occassionally Thru-Hiker as a swap-in, and I still have plenty of room for collecting junk.
---
I do legitimately want to know whos idea the speakers were, has anybody ever used them in either this or FO4 for any longer than a few seconds before becoming irate over their constant moaning
---
 I want a robot Butler to tend my camp and harvest Plants and recourses.
---
Directly behind watoga train station. Easy water, 2 vendors, good fast travel, robots = steel,lead,etc farm, unlimited mirelurk meat and queen which sells for very good if you have recipients for crazy stuff, 90% of the time there‚Äôs a magazine and a bobblehead less that thirty seconds away, constant scorchbeasts but they never come close enough to grief so it‚Äôs a farm whenever you want, also just out of the range of future prime nukes so it never blows up but always is nearby for easy escape if a zone gets too lit
---
Imagine losing two weeks of progression, or even your whole character because of a single player kill. These game mechanics are beyond kind, compared to what's out there
---
That‚Äôs the distinction though. You‚Äôre not roleplaying a raider in real life. You‚Äôre doing it in the game. Exploiting game mechanics because ‚Äúit‚Äôs what a raider would do‚Äù is delusional at best. 
---
Oh gotcha lol
---
It will take longer to respec to something new entirely.
---
Respec is fine tuning not going vats pistol to melee intelligence.
---
It'll take you 10-20 levels to move the points then another 20+ to get new perk cards
---
Level 83 and I've seen maybe 2  3 star items so far.  A meat hook and a boot.  And those were in vendors.  I've not gotten a 3 star to drop. I regularly do the uranium fever and white springs. And it's always just junk that I find.  
---
And speaking of infuriating.  I've been looking for 2 weeks for calibrated shock or the jet pack.   1st week was intermittent server hopping and the second week was dedicated server hopping all day an lve not seen them.  That's hundreds of play sessions. So realistically if u don't server hop and just play normal it could years before u see a certain item.   If I don't find something this week I'm done playing as well.
---
It doesnt, it came with a cardboard disk shape with your download key on it
---
Oh my gosh! I need 30 steel, 60 wood and 6 corn to fix my base!!!
---
Same for trying on the clothes. I didnt buy the bucket hat because it was expensive and I didnt know if it went with any of my outfits 
---
Wait really? That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.  I have always been under the impression that I could only be PVP'd while at the workshop.  Why on earth would anyone ever want a workshop?  Yay I can get a minor amount of junk, and the chance for all my junk to get ganked?  I am level 177 and I've never been attacked while outside a workshop.
---
Fanboys are downvoting, but you were very accurate, mocking all these posts.
---
You on PC? I think I have a pretty good legendary lever lying around
---
I see the problem, and a patch would be nice, but if it was just the Mutfruit could you not have stored, or destroyed if you had to, the Mutfruit and then hit repair all?
---
I have 4 cats in Appalachia in RL.  I really love my camp location but i may have to move it now.
---
Maybe the inventory core is just a protective housing around the likely toxic Plasma Core seen in the weapon? /s
---
You‚Äôre losing the glitch extra weight. Your PA is still giving you the +100 it should or +200 if you have both legs modded with shocks. When you log out and back in wearing the excavator PA a glitch adds 100 weight on top of the 100/200 added from the PA itself. Getting out of the PA removes the glitch weight. 
---
We have a pirate hat, let's get a cool pirate outfit to go with it. 
---
Marine armor
---
Mate, I was not overweight. I was actually about 50 under my weight limit.
---
5 for me (6 once i start assembling the ultracite armor). be nice to be able to tell them apart
---
I'm surprised there's no vault-tec or nuka cola pip-boy...
---
Are the sales and 1 day only items in that list as well?
---
Imagine having your license to play the game rescinded or Bethesda sending big burly dudes to your house to beat you up. I too can come up with arbitrarily harsher punishments. 
---
the shit engine cant handle lots of people having lots of crap on them, so they nerfed the shocks rng
---
Imo it has nothing to do with pvp.
---
2 affixes invalidate all but 1 and that one involves a whole build revolving around low hp.
---
Try finding fusion cores now besides taking the power plants now..... seldom find cores lying around anymore.....
---
The broken stuff that's invisible (like stash and craft stations) does become visible again to repair when you're in build mode.
---
But yeah I'd love for repair all to actually work. And I consider it a bug that repairing crops costs the same materials as planting them, but I can scrap and replant for free. Some things like decon showers even require flux to repair.
---
I wish the only repair costs were common mats like steel/wood/adhesive/fertilizer, at least for objects that have no defensive value like crops and furniture. With the current costs, camp destruction is basically griefing. It makes you want to block everyone you see with a 3-4 digit bounty, and something's wrong if the best defense is blocking people for playing a game as it's designed.
---
Bethesda, please. We want walls. The interior for every wall in the game is garbage except for Stone. (This is my opinion; yours may differ)
---
I would like AT LEAST a wallpaper option. 
---
Also, why do Atom Shop items take up Budget? Do you NOT want us buying more?
---
Combat armor
---
Ok, I admit defeat. 50% or more of fallout 76 players are female.
---
Can this be confirmed because this is the first I've heard of it. Last I was told only during claiming, having you in it, and contesting would open pvp. You're saying 24/7 if you own one? That doesn't sound right ( or good even ). I typically own 5 or 6 (being alone on the server), this could suck. 
---
Had mine there for a while, nice to watch Scorchbeast Disco blasts in the distance at night!
---
in the very corner of the map theres a secret spot with everything, go farm it
---
I think so, but it's not mentioned which items are gonna be limited, Beth decides for that when the items are released. Search for "upcoming Atom Shop items" and you'll find it.
---
 Can you post your build and load out and mutations?
---
Assassin as in pvp or assassin as in stealth?
---
If you wanna be sneaky the lighter the armor the better. Plus some particular legendary perks really help too. Mod it with Shadowed, muffled /ultralight...
---
Youll be golden.
---
To me it looks like blowing up Megaton.
---
whats it matter if the little heart thing doesnt prevent you selling the item like it should
---
Really for stealth I‚Äôm not much of a PVP person
---
Yes it is :( if i get an other i ll let you know
---
I got the alien one for a Flatwoods Monster. No idea why they made them two separate things.
---
Glow map is cool, fits my bunker theme I'm working on. Nuke lamp was too small for me
---
it was a genuine question. i know it won't keep me from scrapping it, but maybe it will help me. as long as i'm not stoned...
---
Fair point, but I thought that was supposed to be ironic haha
---
What happen to all the Nexus modders they hired?
---
Same.
---
Hey I would too, I have over 4000 unspent atom right now. 
---
I've had nearly a full set of raider power armour appear in my inventory plus the Daisycutter. Lost a tactical Gauss at the same time. No idea why - was at the big Red Rocket at the time and hadn't finished anything recently.
---
Thank f\*\*k for this thread, Ive been having the same problem, definitely read and unlocked the military cot, but cannot find it under any of the plans. Definitely not under BEDS, assumed it must be elsewhere and I couldn't find it...
---
At least now I know Im not going mad!!
---
I think the area itself is bugged. I went to collect clipboards for springs yesterday and protectron world models were floating, named "Colonel Gutsy" with the Gutsy voice, the assaultron was a Mr. Gutsy model when it wasn't invisible 
---
Most of the Nuka mixes required two or more other Nuka flavors per mixed bottle.
---
Nuka-Colas are also uncommon enough in the wild that doubling them would still be a slow, inefficient source of caps.
---
Props for amazing, responsive design and theme, you made the SPECIAL roadmap also right? Very good job.
---
wait is this a player or the cryptid. I use big guns so this is easier, but I use low damage to get him around half and then mininuke his ass (that's if we're talking about the cryptid)
---
If this is correct then why isn't that bed called 'military cot'? Fallout 76 is infuriating!
---
Yeah it was, it's just the first thing I thought of when I seen your post.
---
this is what I'm talking about. I'm not generally a skin type of person, so I've just been collecting the ones I've earned. guessing by the downvotes I'm the only one 
---
What platform are you on and what level are you?
---
This build is getting common now.
---
2 weeks ago a guy solo'd sqb in 2 mins using a non legendary combat rifle.
---
why is this important
---
Arent Shocks worth like 5 jetpacks?
---
They became a ex dev after he did so, yes I know its odd, but, for fucks sake the imuture brat couldn't even wait 24 hours to say some negative shit that the recipient couldnt defend, as you know, he's dead.
---
Being nice is server hopping to an unclaimed one, so no, you weren't "being nice".
---
The greaser jacket with the patrolman sunglasses you get on early is really good. 
---
Fallout tactics had some awesome assault rifles like the m14 and m16. Idk why we dont have those... not to mention the wattz 2000
---
And here I am lvl 62 and only halfway through the story. Mire and Cranberry Bog are unexplored. 
---
I hope so,I dont see any positives from it as Ill gain more health from eating or drinking when necessary than the effect.
---
Looks good, whats the gun?
---
You're totally right though
---
Pilko Pump Pants!
---
yeah dump lead belly for bloddy mess, and run tank killer too
---
Leather then. Maybe even Shrouded Wood. You can run heavier ( i have 3 pieces of combat armor) but you should see if you can mod em into a more stealthy playstyle.
---
If youre running a stealth build you can afford to be a little bit squishy. Main goal : kill them before they see you.
---
Because it /feels/ like Fallout and I love Fallout.
---
Yahhh that's what I mean. I dont wanna re-level a character, but I dont mind starting from the vault with nothing. That way everyone's on a different level in terms of perks but on the same level of resources, might increase co op opportunity
---
Ha yeah I bet.
---
You'll get it again, hopefully as soon as you get the 2nd tier of starched genes. :) 
---
Wouldnt it be called an unconnected rod then?
---
Or a magnetic man!
---
How many hours you have in?
---
Can we add this as the forward to the rags to riches tale?
---
Don't forget The Moaning of Life and ofc the pod casts!
---
I like how you misspell roleplaying, but you know the difference between your and you're
---
They‚Äôve said before they definitely notice this is an issue, expect it in the next 2-3 updates
---
Maybe I want to rp as a raider, what‚Äôs wrong with that?
---
Exactly.  The anti-PVP mods are all standard armour.
---
PVPVE Game and yet wonders why people attack him or his base? 
---
YES. That would be nice. 
---
I like silly shit, but inane, non-fallout-esque silly shit should be balanced with more wasteland-ish (or even just FO related attire).
---
Hey, welcome! If you like the game, please feel free to join us over at r/fo76filthycasuals :)
---
I thought about buying pip boy paint. But then I remembered I'm wearing power armor 95% of the time.
---
Guys?
---
Painting the pipboy makes it visible 100% of your game play with the exception of power armor
---
I'm having the same problem today. I either can't connect or it crashes.
---
**No, we don't. Gag and fun items make sense for MTX.**
---
We want those items, the rough, apocolpytic ones, as items you earn in-game...
---
Ditto. 
---
I think if you have a high concentration of a single games play, you start mixing reality and not. I remember playing advanced wars nonstop for a couple weeks and seeing the enemy everywhere. 
---
Yeah, and I know that‚Äôs a mechanic of the game. But I also wanted to find my own, make it more satisfying. 
---
&gt; display a fire arc like when you're tossing grenades
---
Is this a console thing? I've never seen the 'throw arc' on PC. 
---
around 275 at the moment 
---
There's asphalt in the atom shop?
---
Do blueprints take up budget?! I assumed they were just saved templates?
---
I have been there. I had no idea I had to inspect a weapon or armor to see all the perks it had. So many dropped and sold loot that may have been good.
---
No idea what you mean by satire. I've been playing every day since launch, just taking my time with the notes on that first terminal, so my views are as valid as those of someone who rushed and hit level 2 too quickly.
---
Head like a fucking orange 
---
... I want atom shop items to take up 0 budget so I can build an ~~iron~~ princess bed dome around the entirety of my camp...
---
I've only seen a normal chicken. I guess it must have been mating season in the forest.
---
I‚Äôm on now ready to make a trade my gamer tag is grandmasterz04
---
You want to start off with an unfair advantage. It's the wasteland. Expect some difficulty. If you can't play pvp with a level playing field then you are afraid of failure. It's an opportunity for the mouths who've been hassling the pve players to prove they are not the cowards. 
---
I have found my calling in life.
---
I will stand on top of the bridge to the Overseer‚Äôs CAMP and fuck up everyone‚Äôs day.
---
Agreed. Horrible little monsters. The only useful thing I can think of is using them with one of the temporary switches? Like the pressure plate. So if you had that and a speaker hooked up to a garage door it would make a ridiculous noise while opening and closing. To serve as a warning like.
---
If you have pc version you can download a mod that makes it so you can't scrap, drop or sell favorited items. Always something to use until they add it as official feature.
---
 Yeah the cryptid guy. I dunno if you can kill him, but I can blow him away. ;)
---
I get the request to skip the grind but that'd be pretty literally P2W as you'd be buying a "max" level character potentially with real $.
---
I can uninstall and reinstall and that's about it. the crashing has been much better since this last update and I'm on ps4.
---
Honestly I usually leave them on top of the shack after a queen kill so anyone who doesn‚Äôt have that plan can get it. 
---
And I'm on my way to get take-out I'll be back on in a couple hours if you're still on I'll find you.  If not hang on to it please we'll meet up tomorrow.
---
Well im umfortunatlly im on ps4...
---
around 275 at the moment.
---
You probably should play Dark Souls one day.
---
I found this hat during BETA (before Whitesprings became nuke central) and have been wearing it since. Had no idea it was so rare.
---
I'm on the main menu so far this game is fucking amazing. 10/10
---
If you have the "Fire in the Hole" perk you see an arc that shows you where your grenades will land.
---
Same thing for plans: if it could build whatever we have the resources for, that would be great. 
---
Yeah, that's too close to "pay to win" for my comfort. 
---
I love how anti duper‚Äôs use duped weapons and gear lol at least on Xbox I was talking to a group of them one day they also told me any junk they get they turn around and sell. At least in this situation there all hypocrites 
---
Well, what you'll be buying is a lvl 50 character, not any weapons/plans etc of real value. A simple skip to 50 to be able to have a new build.
---
And I don't feel like a lvl 50 is way out there as far as the lvl 200+ people running around.
---
Your advantage over new players is only that, 50 more lvl. Which is the same as if you were to continue to use your main.
---
Carnivore 
---
Weird. Cant say that I've experienced that. 
---
I was playing Star Citizen recently. I just landed my ship and this guy came up, walked into my ship, and started flying it around the hanger crashing it against everything. I called him out on being an asshole. He tried justifying it to me by saying that if the game allows you to do something then he isn't doing anything wrong.
---
Not everyone's a duper, no. Just about everyone advertising broadsheet sale listings is, though, and i'm sick to fucking death of seeing it.
---
Amazing chest ahead
---
How?
---
Tesla on the torso, Tesla coils on the arms, explosive vents. Marsupial. Tse Tesla shotgun? 
---
I'm pretty sure it actually uses less resources if you scrap a plant and replant it than it does to repair. 
---
Whenever plants hold me up from using "repair all" just scrap the existing ones, repair all and replant. 
---
Head into big bend tunnel and you'll at least find a raider who deeply regretted his actions in Fallout 76. They are still human after all.
---
Also, most raiders formed for safety. They did bad things, but generally they'd let people go. Without the rules of society they just found another occupation. They'll kill easy to pick off small groups, and make deals with large groups to get resources. The more ruthless they were, the more likely someone would come for them, but also that people would just give in to their demands without risking a fight. An unnecessary gunfight is generally a loss to a raider (again solo people don't seem like it'll be shootouts, more of a murder and loot). They need their ammo and weapons to protect against other groups trying to take them down. 
---
Destroying a house is asking for trouble, killing a hostage is asking for trouble, etc. Raiders weren't generally stupid (at least not the leaders). They wouldn't just go blow up someone's house. They'd threaten to destroy it and the owners unless they got paid to leave, and so on.
---
There's exceptions, but they're generally shown as being insane from radiation or desperate from a lack of supplies.
---
Not really, firstly because the Queen is farmed for other plans and ultracite plans are just, an admittedly shitty, topping to a cake. Secondly, to the repair costs, the ultracite armor kind of sucks in comparison to others as the DR is negligibly better than other armors. Overall ultracite kind of sucks.
---
I gave up on those doors - I use a metal security door now with the brick set since those actually line up properly!
---
Whitespring/Prime Area?
---
Joe Rogan should be the next DJ. 
---
For whatever reason they view new walls as major content and floor types as minor content but I'm assuming that new "building kits" will be released, just going to take time. 
---
My PSN ID is rennocthegreat.
---
I use quick boy so I never see mine. Really makes me wonder why I bought a black pipboy paint.
---
What are you asking for the carnivore and marsupial?
---
This have to call bullshit potentially till op gets back to us on this subject. 
---
You are paying to have a boost over new players. I feel like everyone should have the same advantages, regardless of how much you've played the game. I just don't agree with the option to pay for boosts. 
---
dont forget . That some people who haven't done anything wrong are also getting banned by some screwed up automated ban system . Sooooo there's that 
---
This is why I always put them in stash prior to trading.
---
Don't log out in commonly nuked zones. 
---
At a birthday party on top of a mountain.
---
Yeah, thats kind of what I was suspecting. I never even used the ultracite armor I got from the quest
---
I never knew how much I needed to see this until now
---
Tough to say whether or not it's rare.  Anybody can pick one up if they know where it spawns, but it's a big wide world out there in Appalachia and those spots are few.
---
I had this happen to me one time. I just place my camp down in the exact same spot. It packed everything up in my stored section, cost me 40caps, but when I placed everything again it was all fully repaired. 
---
Should I feel creeped out? üëÄ
---
I've yet to come across a griefer. I've only played about 30 hours, but if griefing is that big a problem I would have run into one by now. On the other hand, I've ran into a few people that have given me free stuff. Also, how do you describe a raider? All they do in other games is grief you. 
---
Alex- how about search function for builds??
---
Wasn‚Äôt going for cute but I‚Äôll take what I can get ü§ó
---
I missed the mosaic floors.  Didn't think they were a big deal but they look so much better in game than that atom shop picture.  
---
Oh well.
---
Hahah do it! And thanks!
---
What I meant was, at least as far as I know, the only place to get it is the wheelchair at whitesprings.
---
 Its the same hat. I have em' both, but I must admit I like the black one better.
---
It's an ant. It sounds like a bird but those are fucking ants
---
As I wrote to the other comment, your only advantage is 50 lvls above a new player. And what does it matter for the new player if I have a new lvl 50 character, or my old lvl 50 main?
---
Point is I already have a lvl 50 character, and it's not like I can play on both of them at the same time. 
---
I'm sorry, but I really can't see the difference.
---
Totally interested marsupial
---
Fish lamp man - 300 atoms for a little buddy is a bargain!
---
 You can find it not far from the Vault. Some kind of deranged tea party as I remember. ;)
---
Same, it came damaged and i checked the repair costs and then scrapped it
---
I need this too, it is very hard to read.
---
The struggle is real. 
---
Side bar -&gt; Bethesda Plz
---
There are all sorts of advantages in being boosted to level 50. You're asking for a boost to that level, so you obviously agree, and see the difference. Otherwise what is the point in asking for such a boost?
---
I have a system for finding them now but yes its a huge PITB!  Only ever carry 2 and 1 is painted, so I can tell those two, its when I need to get them from stash I place the 2 down, then quickly get all the ones from stash and place them down until the right one pops up.  Drop the rest back into stash.  That 2 minute timer makes you hustle too.
---
I've only managed to get TS or E weapons, still hanging on for TSE. One of my last Whitesprings runs netted me a TS crossbow and TS 10mm SMG. Been using that 10mm SMG so much now, full auto with Prime Receiver and lvl 1 Master Commando because I'm a heavy weapons build. It's so much more efficient at close range than anything else I've got.
---
&gt;Reply
---
I agree, and to be fair I haven't seen anyone die from slap damage, so I don't even know if it's a real thing or something reddit got all worked up about for no reason.   
---
The bounty clearing though I have witnessed first hand. I was at my camp and a group of 3 showed up and 1 guy mowed the base down earned himself a nice 400 cap bounty. My plan was to give him a minute then show up and try and snipe him in the back before his friends could kill me. Instead right in front of me at the camp, his friend killed him and cleared his wanted status then they proceeded to try and goad me into a 3v1 (which I just ignored).   
---
I don't think there is anything Bethesda can really do about that sort of behavior, but that's just plain griefing in my opinion. 
---
I think the castle and racecar bad fall under the: I lived in a vault most of my life and this is so cool I have to have it at my camp. 
---
There is no greifer on earth who is seriously making the argument that they're roleplaying, OP. And there is no greifer on earth who ever stops greifing because someone appealed to their better nature.
---
Source: am greifer.
---
This system only makes sense for players who only play in whitespring as if it was a legendary loot fest hack'n'slash. 
---
msg me on xbox
---
This is Pay to win, no matter how you classify it. If you don't like putting in work, why did you buy a game that requires it? Money should not be an easy way out.
---
&gt;  He tried justifying it to me by saying that if the game allows you to do something then he isn't doing anything wrong.
---
He raises a pretty entirely irrefutable point.
---
The advantage is that I can have a new build. If my main is a sniper, my second character can be a hands on fighter.
---
The only advantage is that I don't have to grind through the main story again. 
---
For the new player, I don't think he cares if there's a lvl 50 sniper or lvl 50 fighter on his server.
---
Make this for pve servers only, not the upcoming pvp.
---
I used to think the same, but I don‚Äôt use flux for a lot of stuff and was sitting on 50 stable of each, so Fusion cores. Also, when I craft them they have 115% power. 
---
Is this because I made some old lady cry and whimper? I did a lot of damage on Thursday night but hers was the most memorable..
---
Huh. I can kinda see why it doesn't work. Being able to craft a gas mask whenever you please could be considered minutely pay-to-win.
---
At the same time, you're likely to find a gas mask pretty soon, and you're guaranteed one at the Fire Breather station from the Overseer's cache. The benefit is so minute that it really shouldn't matter.
---
They need PvE servers.
---
passive only makes it so you can't initiate PvP by attacking someone or their camp
---
Explosive shotguns still going to be super strong. As they are now they are way to strong, it's not even enjoyable one shotting everything imo.
---
Bought and was a great trader camp! Thanks! 
---
Instigating. It is my first strike weapon. 
---
I played wow also many years ago, wow also introduced a boost pack so that you can play the endgame content.
---
If fallout is to survive this, there's going to be some endgame stuff, like dungeons or raids. And I don't think new players are gonna want to grind to lvl 150 just to participate in some raid runs in a later stage.
---
There's always going to be people higher lvl when you first join a game.
---
Im not so sure it will matter when u die in survival u don‚Äôt just drop junk according to the post Bethesda made you also could drop aid or more I‚Äôm going to laugh if the term more means gear or weapons
---
Whether it's meant to be an animatronic or if they just reused the asset is anyone's guess.
---
Yeah but rifle build with sneak is fucked up too. If anyone or anything is hitting the same target as you, you basically do 0 damage. You see the damage go down from all the multipliers and then it slingshots back up to where you basically just shot the enemy with a single bullet with no perks at all. It sometimes even happens when Im alone and sniping something. They really need to fix that issue as it really ruins the gameplay and enemies turn into bullet sponges. 
---
Instigating, it is my first strike weapon.
