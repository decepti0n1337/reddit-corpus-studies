YOU IMPOSTER.

---
Awesome. Good luck!
---
Your first four words earn an upvote. I stopped after those.
---
Every time? Are you sure about that?
---
Mods are broken right now with the exception of mods whose plans you know and have the materials and perks for. "Pinebox" mods you find in the wild and buy from vendors are not attaching.
---
Thanks!  I’m hoping there is a good middle ground between legendary weapons everywhere and a feeling of complete randomness.
---
Yeasssssnoyessssss
---
The point of challenges isn't just to hand out free currency to the players, they're also a tool used to get people to participate in certain events or game features.  For every person that just decides to screw it and not do the challenge you have some people who decide to go for it, and for those people that decide to go for it you have people that actually find they enjoy it.
---
No that's likely around 500 for most people. But even so that's still enough to not waste hundreds of chems like people claim.
---
Thank you very much!
---
Sell lasers? I don't know, Skippy. Those things have some good scrap.

---
So also if the owner is far from the reclaiming circle (that is not fair if there is an "handicap match").  In this case i think it's better (at least in adventure) activate the pvp only in the reclaiming circle. This way the owner can decide by himself to contest the reclaim and fight with you
---
Where did you find the Yao Guai and Owlet?
---
Is that a broken thing on energies? And ik about yhe stagger im running tormentor amd tank killer. I shld be staggering them
---
Lol yea i honestly love the gatling plasma. Its just a fun weapon to use. If they worked like they are suppose to, they would actually be decent weapons.
---
Seriously?  They days of freebie atoms are over?  Today's challenges include killing 10 of a thing a level 1 player can kill with their bare hands and scrapping five fucking toys.
---
1400 from vendors, cap stashes with search perk, selling to other players.
---
You have to do dryer washer and click calendar.
---
Take inventory count before doing another large batch and keep track of how many it was supposed to brew vs your total end amount. 
---

---
I've noticed super duper hasn't always been playing the proc sounds but still seemed to be producing extra versions. Not sure if this is what you are experiencing or not.
---
My laser rifke is putting out 300dmg every shot tho
---
So youll wait an extra day to make the same amount? If the goals 2000 caps i need to sell 8 serums, you have to sell 5. I can probably sell those 8 to 2-3 people where youll need to sell to 4-5 and in the time it takes you to sell 1 to 5 people i can sell 2 to 5 people because of the price point. Thats profit in quantity. And in retail if its a good deal its never a 1-1 trade. You wouldnt pay $4.00 for something if the store next door had the same item at $2.50 in fact you may even buy 2. Cause 2 for 5 is better than 1 for 4.
---
Might be interested in the gauss for caps or trade.
---
I'm on
---
Another japan based player here! It’s really frustrating not being able to buy any Atoms. I have to super ration any that I win in game, and restrict myself to buying only the really cheap items.
---
I hope this will be sorted in the future although I’m not optimistic. :(
---
I spat out my Nuka Dark when I read this.
---
Set washer and dryer according to note, then look at the poster above/aside the dryer there's a button.
---
Since they are ignoring armor pen they honestly should nerf energy resistance across the board for PvE enemies. Robots even more so. At least give us robots.
---
The event was the only thing that was fun about the whole quest.  And it was terrifying.  Maybe a minimum level?
---
They're getting downvoted because they're being a idiot.  People are bitching and moaning over todays challenges being too hard and Bethesda ramping up  their difficulty when they include SCRAPPING FIVE TOYS AND KILLING 10 FIREFLIES.
---
The way I would change it would be to have a delay once it's contested, say 10 seconds. The circle goes up and everyone inside, regardless of whether they own the shop or not, get a pop up notifying them of what's going on. 
---
You have until the end of the timer to unass the area or prepare for a fight.  If only the contesting player, or their teammates, remain inside the circle, the claim is automatically completed. This will prevent the entering and exiting practice that allows for cap farming an owner without them seeking revenge.
---
Are you using lone survivor cards under charisma?
---
no but if anyone finds a Mothman one i'd love to know where. the day the update went live, i was browsing the possible mounts and saw the mothman one. i thought "cool", and closed the build menu.
---
not even thirty seconds later, a goddamn vengeful mothman (tbh the first mothman i have seen aside from Wise Mothman, and i've been playing since the beta) showed up and started attacking my house. i killed it with a fire axe cuz i was literally out of all ammo.
---
i have since made it my mission to mount a mothman head in my house. but i can't find the plans anywhere. and it saddens me.
---
And I'm a professional flail monkey, and fucked everything up the first time... Hope you weren't there
---
Fyi the rejuvenated perk in endurance gives like 70% resist along with +50 AP Regen and something else I can't remember when your well fed/hydrated. Anyhow it still seems to be working correctly.
---
you got the adrenal mutation and strange in numbers equipped? Because their is bug from like centuries ago where it cancels out this mutation. At least that's the problem for me and the reason why I can never equip strange in numbers, which is kinda sad.
---
no the real truth is you find out you had the sheepsquatch inside of you all along....
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
also the world is flat..... not going to lie alcohol may have been involved but when bethesda tells you to chug 50 what other option you got?
---
I mean something has to happen. Lol but honestly i dont even hold my breath anymore. It took forever for bethesda to even give us durability.
---
There's a end table that I used as a make shift stool untill I got one myself :) there pretty convincing
---
Never worked for energy stuff.  I know it sucks
---
Mmh yes. This seems the right solution.
---
You could very loudly area broadcast over your mic.  I haven't tested the full distance that sound travels but it is honestly in my experience much further than I wished it was when some one has it wide open to their dog barking ha ha.  Now it possibly lead to a ban if you played copyrighted material on said "station" but you could definitely do talk radio.
---
How about "a small but overly vocal minority of players whining"
---
Cool story bro! Neeeeds more  dragons, though.
---
I think its okay that they don't,  but they should at least up the chances slightly. 
---
The 3 starred bosses definitely need a boost to drop rates maybe even unique pools to make certain ones better for certain items.
---
If this were a single player game would people be upset about repair kits? If this game was CO-OP would people be upset by repair kits being an optional in-game currency item that can be purchased with tokens earned in game or actual cash? Because this game is online people feel like they are competing for something and therefore anything that gets any side an edge is seen as unfair if the other side doesn't have it as easily available. I get all that- power ups for cash. Atoms are easier to get than addictol. I think they are easier to obtain than psycho (without the recipe), ballistic fiber , and nuka cola quantum ( unless a recipe exists) Atoms are definitely easier to obtain than solo farming Vangaurd 3*  heavy combat armor pieces or any other full set of legendary gear. Without other players they are even easier to accumulate in 24hrs than mutation recipes ( caps permitting). I'm sure some people have done everything but the time locked challenges- some are bugged and therefore troublesome. Yet, I don't see anyone freaking out about the other items. Atoms aren't hard to get. The cash value attached to them illicits the same resentment and anger that resides in all of us towards economic classes. Especially being gamers; were thinkers, artists, creative types, and games are the place we can go away from real life because I'm the game we can be and do all the things that life has limited us. Our imaginations come to life and it's really beautiful to interact or see everyone doing there thing and playing their way. Whether it's eating shit, getting into fights, passing food and water, sharing recipes, rescuing a stranger, passing each other In the hall at whitesprings and shooting a thumbs up cause you dig their style, to stumbling upon another players camp that has everything you needed and seeing the door unlocked and extractors unlocked so you can rest and stash in peace, then fix up and head out.
---
I get the repair kits, the fact that casual players find farming hard. I don't get why Bethesda would implement them. They are unnecessary and break many social aspects of the game.  They remind us of class, and the fact that money can in some way provide an experience others cannot have. You have to find your parts just like all of us, you have to earn every screw or buy it with caps purchased in time, blood and sweat- or your significant others stash or your "good guy greg" amigo. 
---
I'm not gonna stop playing the game, but i won't be buying them. 
---
#dont be greedy Bethesda
---
Ran across a event in which about 10 players were over level 100 and fighting level 50 enemies, and I'm just watching with my level 31 guy.
---
It was a sight to behold.
---
I'd say it is more than reasonable and honestly love this!
---
I'm a fan of sharing photos taken by other team members for loading screens
---
Hopefully implemented with the new cameras they are releasing, otherwise I feel that release will just be disappointing.
---
Ideally I'd like armor pen to work on energy weapons but that might require a rewrite of code and its always easier to implement something from the beginning versus trying to force it in later. 
---
But at least a broad ER nerf across the board would be a good stopgap measure. 
---
Lets hope they don't nerf durability later when the repair kits come out.
---
That would be cool. I feel like most people are getting pretty mindless with their builds and solely focusing on damage.
---
Sell stuff.
---
I've spotted this at least once on xbox  spent a few minutes billygoating up and down the hillside looking for a mine entranceway. Thought it was a new event.
---
Did they sync with your Steam account, oh wait...
---
Yea I have both those things, that's sucks since my build heavy uses mutations and that card is the best. Well thanks for telling me
---
If you're on PC then it's probably just hackers.
---
I guess we’ll find out at 7
---
Event =/= Dungeon
---
Hah : )
---
America! FUCK yeah.
---
I actually thought the charge damage was higher when I was messing with it today. Maybe the base reduced and the charge damage exponentially increased to compensate? Also not sure how it would calculate two shot while uncharged vs mad charge.
---
So any opinion that isn't in line with your own is stupid?
---
Got it.
---
Me too!
---
I ran a silo solo and then helped taking down the SBQ last night, not one piece of gear broke. I do run Makeshift Warrior 5, Gunsmith 3 and Power Patcher 3 however. With those equipped, its absolutely manageable and I don't mind putting points into them. 
---
Maybe its just my naivety, but I really don't think they're so bloody underhanded to boost degradation rates to sell a stupid repair pack (which I still will not buy). I can't rule it out however.
---
Yeah servers would need to be buffed up some to make this work more effectively. This is more a down the line idea anyways.
---
I mean, is it really spoilers to say that you DON’T encounter something? Idk, personally I’d rather not get my hopes up. But fair enough I suppose, I apologize regardless.
---
Hydra? Cobra? Do you have another serpent based terrorist cult?
---
Yeah, I don’t mean these particular challenges, obviously... I mean the 20 atom ones and the legendary kill near a fissure site
---
Happened to me, but I never deleted fallout 76 when my pictures were deleted
---
Thanks
---
I also got sick of this. Ended up finding a nice little farming run that when combined with the 2*harvesting perk nets me about 10 cures.
---
If there are they’ll be too farmed out to enjoy.
---
My alternatetive way was to do the same thing at moss town. There is no real other way. I just hope this challenge and the storm one are rare( i had a storm on my base today).
---
It's not *impossible*. It's just got no method of executing it which isn't terrible.
---
I'm new and I don't understand the hate.
---
 If you love Bethesda. You'll love this game. Who cares about the bugs.. I enjoy em'. Blah,blah .yaada, yada, yada...
---
Anybody who's interested make your best offer on this threat.
---
I can't wait to mount "XXunladrealgamerXX" and "P*$$ySlayer69XD" on my wall.
---
Wait that's still doesn't make sense since Im losing around 250 and that perk only adds 25% more
---
*drinking fountain. Not being from the US we don't call them fountains, we call them bubblers. I spent way too long looking for a 'fountain' like a decorative fountain.
---
I've been suggesting something similar for a while. Responders radio, working similar to Hunter/hunted but able to be triggered by another player like artillery blasts or vertibirds. 
---
Craftable "help" beacons that if you're listening to a "responders" radio allows players nearby to get the distress beacon and follow it to a player in need. Could even sync to the "ask for help" when you're downed in a fight. Make more use of that functionality in the game and stays very lore friendly. 
---
Kinda wasteland equivalent of calling 9-11
---
There are cameras?
---
Again, obviously not these challenges, as I answered on your other reply. You’re not good at reading aren’t you? I gave particular examples of what I mean and yet you’re replying with other examples with the word „fu*king“ to make your point.
---
Keep the faith bud, I scored a 3 star Troubleshooters missile launcher off the imposter last night.
---
All the pictures are linked to the character. Everyone else would see their own pictures. Its a really cool idea though. It has be3n suggested a few times now
---
I hate to be that guy but there's no way you should be wasting that many stims or that much ammo.
---
When you say "just like the mistress of mystery weapons", do you mean you have to have the original weapon too?  Because I sold my annoyingly level 30 Fixer already **AND** after that, I was awarded the Fixer plan from the quest and absent-mindedly consumed it...
---
I think when/if you see private servers with mods, they'll just unlock unlimited building and allow players to overlap CAMPs and create functioning interconnected buildings/settlements.
---
I feel you, I wish they would fix this.
---
I see a lot of mention of selling serums, but it can have a rather high initial investment cost.  
---
I am still just pawning mutant guns. Sharpshooter Assault Rifles oooh yes.
---
And it isn’t just me. Several of my friends have had it happen to them as well. Also on PS4
---
Umm, getting to the cap limit is pretty easy to do legitimately. My experience with the economy is it's hard to get into at first (can't imagine it post-cap-stash-nerf) but once you get a few thousand, find some good items or your hoarded ammo and junk to sell, and start acquiring your mutation/weapon/armor loadout, CAPS BECOME MORE AND MORE COMMON AND LESS AND LESS VALUED. That's not to say you're unsatisfied with caps and jack up your prices, but when I have nothing left that I need to really spend caps on because I've finished my build, I'm okay with spending 13k caps on an item because I don't need them as much. And if you take what you called the "flipper" route, you can reach the cap limit in a week or two just making good trades, and then you'll have the caps on hand just in case something phenomenal shows up for sale. 
---
So idk what your trading experience has been, but mine has always been great. As you get into the market you get used to high prices (even though a lot of stuff like serums have cheapened considerably), and your 25k stuff tends tl be God-tier and your build is finished so you're okay with it.
---
Capture gallery on PS4 maybe?  I've found copies of all of my FO76 in-game snaps there as well as manual screenshots.

Is this an event? How is this boss generated?

Messenger seems to have gotten a boost of some sort or maybe unintentionally from adjustments to spawns, but I've been getting bigger swarms and better event rewards for the last two patches.

energy weapons. energy damage armor, easy peasy
---
To be honest I kinda wish Beth reworked the explosive legendaries so they didn't sound like fizzy soda.
---
Just tested it. Still got melted.
---
Yea, and it's called cherry picking to make your argument not look like crap.  The VAST majority of challenges are still total pushovers.  4/5 of today's challenges can still be completed with nothing more than a handful of server hops.
---
I feel the same way. Im already over nuke zones because after dozens of hours in them i have nothing but xp to show for it. Queen fights same thing. The drops are sh*t, fasnacht event i did 50+ times and still didnt get 6 rewards now in 2 nights of hopping i havent even seen this event. Its not fun anymore. my incentive to play is the belief ill get a decent reward. In 450 hours every good item i have is from another user. If the dungeon doesnt drop some amazing reward i will have no motivation to run it again because as the parade showed us we may never get the reward ever and why should we keep putting in the time for nothing?
---
If you are a conduit and dont let yourself die then yes you definitely can use that many stims.
---
Here’s what I think.
---
 Calvin was always obsessed with Sheepsquatch. I think he saw the real one once. There is a terminal entry about other fake Sheepsquatches that he made. And how he was using them to attract tourists. Pretty minor stuff. Doesn’t merit secret agents and killing cops. I think he was innocently using the Sheepsquatch as a way to make money, all while having a secret weird obsession with the real one. 
---
Whoever Bo-Peep and Wolf work for are cryptid Hunters. They have been looking for the real Sheepsquatch and their attention is grabbed by Calvin. They hire him for some sort of job and he leaves. 
---
When he comes back, he is now an (unwilling?) agent of Bysshe. And he uses his fake Sheepsquatches to try to lure out the real one. 
---
I’d have to read the medical note talking about Calvin’s insanity again but maybe it’s just a decoy. Or his sister took him and no one would believe him. 
---
That’s my best theory of this whole thing.
---
I keep trying different weapons on it. Most of what I’ve got tickles him.  
---
Maybe I should get a chainsaw.
---
While I agree the Mogstation is complete garbage and clunky as hell to use, it is infinitely better than the system they had for FFXI playonline was garbage on a 100 degree 100% humidity day.
---
Except its easy to reach the cap from other sources. One loot run and I can knock out most of the caps of a vendor with no cost to me. 
---
Serums have value because you can sell them the other players after capped.
---
Haven't bought it yet but if you do and decide to experiment, I'd be interested in knowing too.
---
I've been able to paint my power armour but not mod it. I've been able to craft weapon and armour mods, but not apply mods found in the world. I'm on PC.
---
As already answered: server hops shouldn’t be a necessarily for completing these.
---
If this were fallout 4 I’d be all for it.   This being an online game I’m certain this would lag the fuck out of your CAMPs.
---
I'm having the same issue putting a barrel mod on a lever action. I believe this is a bug atm
---
Two shot gatling plasma. 
---
PEW PEW-return of the pew.
---
Try repairing at the CAMP with repair all structures. I've had something similar happen and that fixed it. Also maybe try storing the generators and then placing them again.
---
I love this idea! This would be such a killer addition to the camp system.
---
I'm level 27 and still repping Raider PA. However I am on my way to getting the Excavator PA.
---
It stinks of it.
---
It's not even really required anymore since the cap pool is shared.
---
It completely breaks the fourth wall in terms of reasoning for where the faction vendors normally are. Like how do the responders and raiders somehow maintain vendor bots in the same building?
---
And the fact that there's a vendor representing the Whitespring *in the Whitespring?!*. Not only that, they named it "Shopping Mall Vendor". Please! It's like some shite mod from page 122 of nexus mods.
---
To end my rant, I leave you with one final thought: 
---
#PROTECT AND SERVE.
---
It's always freaking worms too, isn't it?  No point in curing worms when you'll just be infected with worms again the first time a radtoad looks at you from 500 yards away.
---
Weapons? Not that I recall. Weapon mods? All the time.
---
Depends what you are fighting, the normal is good all around, but the ultracite one is only good for killing scorched things. If you are doing the queen I would say definitely bring the ultracite but other than that you should stick with normal
---
Some of us aren’t cynical towards this game
---
Me too... memories!
---
Yeah, it's from the Encryptid event at the end of the Lying Lowe chain of missions.
---
Because you say so?  They make completing the tasks infinitely easier but you refuse to do it because... reasons?
---
You had two options today, server hop a few times and complete all of your challenges or REFUSE to do something so simple on some sort of self inflated moral grounds and instead whine to reddit about how it's SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO hard killing fireflies.

Ultracite - it scales to level 50 (standard laser is 45) so does more damage slightly, has a little more durability, i hear it also does bonus base damage to scorched? But i'm not 100% on that
---
Ah okay I think I did them all. I'll look for that event to pop up
---
I was totally surprised that it worked so well.  I tried the chainsaw out on a Scorched Leader first and it made short work of him, and right after that I got the pop-up that Encryptid was happening on the server so I fast traveled over just in time to jump in.
---
Yes. I need my friend’s underwear-clad ass on display for everyone.
---
+karma Agreed. We need transparency on this topic.
---
Interesting
---
The Burrows can be soloed. That was all I needed to hear to put my fears to rest.
---
Honestly Im just gonna chalk it up as like 50 cents I missed out on. Not a big deal for how much fun I have playing.
---
At least other people are getting this bug I thought i broke something.
---
Does anyone else also get trees/bushes at a certain distance blur like im looking out of map but its only inside the tree/bush.
---
Could also effect twisted muscles. I don't know anymore details on this, but my buddy runs no adrenal reaction and he is doing fine. Nevertheless if I go full bloodied I lose around 700 damage so yeah, all I know is that these two things don't go well together.
---
Wolf and owl here, and my friend got the Yao and the Radstag. Have yet to spot any others.
---
My idea wasn’t to link up locations. But to extend within the same lane zone. Think like a boarded up building. You have access to the main floor and once you improve that you can tear down the wall and build in that section.
---
A cross server version might be better, otherwise you might end up with 30 people LFG on 30 separate servers. If it worked cross server when enough people joined it could "fast travel" you to a server with enough slots for the team.
---
Dude, what the hell is wrong with you? It is a fact that they’re getting more time consuming, not because I say so. I did 3 of them and not refused too, where did I wrote that? I’m still enjoying the game, but that doesn’t mean that I can’t criticize something and when you look on the like ratio of these posts, Iam not the only one who thinks so.... so yeah, have a nice day dude.
---
It is in the game [this pic](http://imgur.com/vTWF3WF) was in a post a bit ago
---
Does this all the time. Pretty common map bug.
---
Same, my friends sometimes play, 2 play I should say but I mostly play solo since my other friends haven’t played since before Halloween
---
Jumping on now
---
Nope. I’ve been playing since beta. Never unlocked a weapon
---
Never was much of a white springer so I’ve always farmed watoga/ cranberry bog. Two days farming not a legendary robot in sight. They seemed to have nerfed all the surrounding buildings that had legendaries in them as well. Highly bummed out about this hopefully temporary but I doubt it.
---
question: can Enforcer slow/cripple the sheep?
---
highly doubt as it’s a boss..
---
Is this related to renaming it?
---
Don't use Strange in Numbers, it literally breaks/cancels like 3/4 mutations. I hastily avoid that perk, shame because it has SO much potential.
---
So much misinformation. That picture is from the data miners from like 3 days ago. Doesn't necessarily mean it's in game yet
---
The GECK idea isn't half bad, though I'd like to der that incorporated into some content where we help some vault survivors found a new city with a GECK that then becomes a central player hub :P
---
My stash is so full of junk. I'd scrap it and then bulk the junk to sell that I just skip the middleman.
---
I think people confused the ultracite lasers with Prime mods and thought the standard ultracite lasers also did bonus damage vs scorched. I’ve seen nothing to support this in game, but I’ve also not directly tested it to disprove it.
---
Where am I cynical? It’s just a well known thing which often occurs in online games, I haven’t said anything else. Aren’t we allowed to criticize something now? Iam neither toxic, cynical nor am I using vulgar language.
---
I live on the west virginia border. Its pronounced so many ways. Even in the same area it can be pronounced 5 different ways.
---
Dont worry about man, people were probably just being dicks.
---
Rampant bug. Messing with purchased mods, not self-constructed ones. For weapons and PA.
---
Exactly.  You can see the frustration everyone is currently having with the event now mainly dropping low level items... if it goes unchecked, it could lead to real issues in my opinion.
---
Source? I think a lot of people confused Prime mods with actual ultracite lasers. To the best of my knowledge ultracite lasers don’t do anything special.
---
Either you're talking about the wheelbarrow back armor, or I need to lay better attention lol. Now I'm gonna go looking for a sink armor super mutant.
---
So it doesn’t trigger when fighting the queen?
---
[](/celestiawhat)I've never had that happen, but I did learn how to cook a food by eating it. Didn't know that was a thing for the longest time.
---
That's my exact thesis on it too, not personally tried it and i see no buff (could be a hidden stat?) i thought i'd throw it out there, i'm interested to see if someone has done a definitive test on it but i've yet to see one
---
Dafaqqqqqqq
---
when he was loading the sheepsquatch personality he had "mating rituals" my first thought was hes gonna bone the robot, but now I think he wanted to lure real sheepsquatch with the robot.
---
Idk man, did it like 6-7 times and all the legendaries I got we're pretty good lvl45-50 2-3* items, all of which I'm saving for rerolls
---
Gonna ask an honest question, are you using mods on. The PC version? Cause many of the 76 mods cause resource draining from bad implementation. If you are using mods, try turning them all off and see if problems remain. 
---
I went through something similar and now I still just mostly play this on Xbox instead and am waiting for real mod implementation to be released instead of a lot of the current patchwork stuff that is pretty game breaking once you stack them.
---
The lore behind Arktos could definitely suggest their involvement in creating the sheepsquatch. But there are other cryptids in Appalachia (mothman being confirmed pre-war), based on cryptid legends IRL, so it could go either way as to whether sheepsquatch is Arktos or just a normal cryptid.
---
The sheepsquatch was the friends we made along the way
---
Done it 6 times and havent gotten a 3 star yet
---
So buy some?
---
Sneak/Crit/VATS build, level 200+, END GAME is finding the wimpiest and most difficult weapon and making it work when it shouldn't, while still doing it better then people in power armor.
---
mid level i primarily used an instigating lever action, intigating combat rifle, furious handmade, TSE lever action and TSE combat rifle.

now i use any interesting ranged weapon that drops and began pulling out muled weapons, beserkers explosive pump? quad 25% faster fire rate double barrel? level 5 two-shot 10MM pistol? level 15 handmade? furious assault rifle? every gamma gun? etc.
---
Theyve been getting progressively worse. At 50-60 per day, it's 20 days to buy a cheap power armor paint. That's completely ignoring all the other stuff. Give us a break guys!
---
Yes please farm all the mats for me and do all the crafting and sell me 3 serums a day so I don't have to worry about farming/crafting for caps anymore.Lol.
---
I don’t get why people think he wanted to fuck the robot. I don’t remember the exact details but there is another note that talks about using mating rituals and calls as a way that hunters lure out prey. It’s pretty clear that’s what they are trying. Calvin is just a little weird guy.
---
The trading system as a whole needs redesigned. 
---
This trading system is exactly the same from Fallout 4; which is single player game.
---
Well thanks a lot man!  I really appreciated your reply hope you have a great one!
---
You can add me tatlsjade.
---
My inner stalker so badly wants to break into other people's C.A.M.P.s and look at all their photos.
---
It's only standard for multiplayer RPGs.
---
Not sure about the bots outside but it definitely hasn't affected Monster Mash yet at let. Still spawning at least 2-3 per event.
---
Well they could start by making PvP fun, skill based and rewarding or they could make slap a worthless reward of 10 atoms for doing this event 4 times in a day.
---
Well I think u and I both know this game is a serious hit or miss, I think we need more content with this level of difficulty
---
Misunderstanding. 
---
Grey is not “your damage”. Grey is “how much damage has been done while you’re damaging it”. Since a chainsaw constantly damages it, you’re constantly seeing ALL damage done by every player.
---
The plans allow you to craft one., I just received them.  The quest awarded Fixer is not required in crafting them.  Just normal crafting mats.  All the mods are Combat Rifle oriented.
---
You cannot scrap The Fixer, even ones you craft.
---
Found this link on another thread about the same thing. Also having this problem with my X01

I think people are underselling the value of Fireproof/dense with Grounded here, that 100 Energy resistance may be doing wonders
---
I agree with this but I can also understand wanting to enjoy a game and not get so pissed you can’t see straight that is kind of the point of gaming to enjoy something that isn’t stressful and to escape how shitty reality is
---
Stop being a misogynist.
---
Bullshit you have done the event 3 times today. I've only seen the event a handful of times in 400+ hours of playtime. Certainly not once today in 8 hours and 50+ server hops.
---
You have my rifle GT: SteinLone
---
There's nothing more frustrating than watching an entire server run around REFUSING to conduit the pilons.
---
4th fail in a row cause all the level 250+ are sitting on the roof for some fucking reason.
---
Do your damn job and the shit can be over in like 3 minutes. Fuck.
---
/Rant
---
It just doesn't seem as epic is all.
---
OMG ME TOO! Came here to say just this.
---
True but even yhem my handmade i have same problem
---
Your point was that they don't question Bethesda, wether or not it's outrage, annoyance, slight anger, or just being a contrarian this sub is far from sucking Bethesda's dick. Sure maybe 1/3 of posts every now and then are giving some positive feedback, couple are over the top praising them sure. Most however is pointing out why the games broken or shit and why. Like the positive side there's a few posts going over the top and condemning them for nothing. Anyway I'm rambling, most of the sub is all too willing to grab pitchforks but it's getting better
---
No idea, but I highly doubt it- I just know it doesn’t count when I kited a legendary gulper to prime for the legendary kill@fissure site, nor did it count when I leveled up from killing a scorchbeast while taking rad damage from Prime. No “level up at a fissure site” credit.
---
You can’t equip the same perk twice
---
I mean they said Wastelanders would completely change the game, but wasn't expecting this as the direction. 🤷‍♂️
---
Agreed I don’t think it’s too hard but not too easy the difficulty feels great for me and I’m not in god armor. I just have a standard excavator suit with a non legendary ultracite Gatling laser.  I die a few times but that’s the point of the event. People need to understand this is not a solo game.  You need to do it with a team. This is an online game play it as such and stop whining.
---
There at least needs to be a queue system for the new dungeon, although I am looking forward to trying to solo it kind of hoping I won’t be able to.
---
Gt ColeBlooded45
---
Is it running Armour piercing magazines? They also don't add ANY penetration (broken)
---
Agreed, the lack of communication is serious with 76 , going from an all single player to multiplayer crowd though, it's expected
---
Yep. It only lowers DR, not ER. Energy weapons will always be behind until they fix that.
---
Not quite yet, they come out on the 23rd
---
Its a 20 minute quest. You could just not read Reddit right after new content drops and its the relevant topic. Lets everyone not talk about a current event because this guy has a busy schedule
---
I’ll be at my camp. Let me know when you are ready and I’ll come your way
---
I only use it in my exploration loadout (perk loadout manager) because it does buff carry weight and jump height.
---
Hahaha yeah you're not wrong, not as good for xp either
---
This game is garbage.
---
Well, that’s really unfortunate... guess I’m not doing the queen for that challenge then, because why that should be different.
---
Remember when daily challenges were "Kill a Super Mutant" and "Level up!". Now they're "Kill 10 [hard-to-find enemies] while intoxicated from [hard-to-find alcohol]" and "Level up 3 times (in a single day), once near Grahm, once while naked, and once in this remote location". There's no question they're getting more obnoxious to complete and it's obvious they're doing it to cinch off the free atom income.
---
Try dropping it and picking it up. Warning, dropping it may cause you to lose it.
---
I don't even do that, it seems to almost prevent my healing factor from working, i use so many stims lmao
---
No, Adrenal adds up to 60% more damage depending on your health. SiN bugs it to fuck and I’ve seen it actually put me at a negative modifier instead of a positive. So I was doing less than I would have had without the Adrenal mutation at all.
---
I would just like more than 50 photos on the film roll.  And not having it linked to the other characters.
---
This is the build I'm thinking of.

Power User can be used to help with Core Drain and if I need to make it three stars I'm sure I can move a point around from somewhere or level up a two star version of Batteries Included. I did decide to drop Party Boy though since I can focus more on Luck for building up crits and helping the chance to refill AP.
---
I have this happen almost every time I’ve done the event (admittedly only 3 times). I think there’s some poorly displayed AoE damage zones in the event that you can’t really see most of the time.
---
Yea can't install mods on my PA. PS4
---
Happened to me on Uranium Fever. Cool to know it can happen with other events as well.
---
You’re confusing grind for instant gratification.
---
I haven't done the numbers but last night instead of
---
Civil War Era Top Hat
---
Or
---
Marine Tactical Helmet
---
I saw this in a vendor,
---
Syringer 132c
---
Wasn't running outside long enough the last couple of days but can confirm Monster Mash in the high school is still spawning legendaries without an issue. 
---
Also the mire has still been spawning legendaries without issue. I CAMP out there so I'll walk from the crashed plane to the power station and I'll hit at least 10 legendaries each run. It's currently the best return for time in my opinion.
---
What’d you get from there?
---
I want to play holo tape games on my TV (console) or Terminal (PC) lol
---
I tried both dropping it as well as the gauntlet. No luck
---
You do not need the original weapon to craft them.  You also cannot scrap them, even ones you craft.
---
It’s purple for me in the Mire
---
On a desk in the mining HQ
---
Don't worry about it.  I'm considered "high level" but I play pretty casually.  I got a lot of the levels just doing quests and events.  I do the big events like SBQ when I can but it's not like I go dropping nukes or go tanking these huge bosses.  I'm mostly a builder and adventurer.
---
Damn you Reddit... Nuking my carriage returns is stupid.
---
Well they have to make money somehow,it's not like they are gonna pay the bills selling pink too-toos and beehive hairdos and shit on the atom shop.These repair kits and more items like them coming soon are the perfect vehicle.Their cosmetic only atom shop didn't turn out to be the cash cow they thought it would be.
---
It's a fact that they're getting more challenging?
---
The FACTS here are that you clear one of the today by picking up and scrapping a few god damn wooden blocks and toy cars.  It's a FACT that two of the challenges cam be completed in a SINGLE EVENT by popping a chem before you make the last turn in.  It's a FACT that one of the challenges can be completed by tossing on some sunglasses, grabbing a sword and popping a chem the kill before you level up.
---
The ONLY challenge that carries ANY difficulty in even the SLIGHTEST is the fucking fissure site legendary kill.  You're starting shit about Bethesda being money hungry greedy fucks and ramping up challenge difficulty to force people into buying atoms because ONE OUT OF FIVE challenges is ACTUALLY CHALLENGING.
---
Im really regretting some power armor paints I don’t use lol... still sitting on 3k atoms, but if it’s getting harder to grind in the future maybe the average is only 20-30 atoms a day and not 50-60, so I’m holding on to some of them for a little longer
---
That's near the top of my dream features list. I don't need NPCs, but let me craft some robots as followers or base defense and I'll be quite happy.
---
Yes give me 3* wood armor. It deserves more love for the rate at which I pick it up
---
NGL, I'm american and made the same mistake.
---
oh my god, getting excited over something so small that should be common sense to implement - actually it should be that it doesnt even show up in the scrap menu if u favourited it
---
but let's all jump over the moon for really small updates that should have a better implementation from the start. they obviously didnt even think it thru
---
i am sorry, i once loves the fallout series but 76 has just made me way too cynical
---
Whats the fucking point of using a pre-existing character with all the good shit already?  Tons of Caps farmed already so no big loss on that one either.  Why the fuck would you let people do this?  Survival mode should be from scratch for everybody.  
---
I created a new character for survival mode.  I knew the possibility going in it was going to be a shit fest of high level dick heads who already farmed tons of good shit ganking lowbie's.  This has happened a minimal number of times thankfully.  Might have just got lucky though.  I am ok with dropping aid and junk, losing caps when I die.  There should be a penalty for getting killed.  
---
I enjoy the minimal respawn points.  It forces me to keep moving my camp around.  Being more sneaky and being aware of my surroundings has improved the experience a lot for me. I hope they listen to the feedback and make some changes.  I am cool with starting another character from scratch if needed after implementing them.
---
How is playing fair using game mechanics make anyone assholes or mean spirited? 
---
The game developers even made a perk card to destroy other players structures... cuz it’s a core component of gameplay. In fact most games that have any weapons or the ability to pvp are “kill-on-site” so why is this any different? If you say it’s level difference I’ll just laugh cuz I killed a ton of players this week while I was lvl 10-20 and those players were lvl 100 or better. My suggestion to anyone struggling is, if you see your camp being attacked just server hop... and don’t claim workshops, ever..... it’s literally an invitation to others to come kill you if you didn’t already know. All the issues described are just the game mechanics working as intended.
---
Wait, what is the most commonly accepted pronunciation? I'm a Brit so yeah i just go App-Al-Achia
---
I am getting this on PC currently at my weapons bench haven't checked armor.
---
I've tried charging rent to radworms, but they never pay up.  I'm a plague walker now, so when life infects you with lemons...
---
The whole point of patch notes is to keep us informed about changes to the game, why bother releasing it if they're cherry picking the info they want to give us
---
All right, cheers. Time to stop lugging around this underlevelled rifle then.
---
Probably to better track the imposter sheepsquatch.
---
 [https://dictionary.cambridge.org/de/worterbuch/englisch/pusillanimous](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/de/worterbuch/englisch/pusillanimous)

OHHH
---
I've been looking for a big water feature-like fountain. They meant bubblers this whole time xD
---
Then you aren't paying enough attention because it's up constantly.  I spent the past four weeks doing absolutely nothing but server hopping while farming my Traveling Leather Coat and it had to be one of the most common events I'd see up. 
---
But you're right, I haven't seen it three times.  Actually it was five.  I didn't bother counting the other two because I showed up with under three minutes remaining and just killed some fireflies before server hopping again so I'd already have a stash ready.
---
But how will (enter player name here) know that their issue isn't affecting everyone else? You expect them to READ reddit? What sort of masochistic person are you? People need their issues read by hundreds and replied by the few that actually care.
---
Which ain't me either. I agree with you, bud.
---
Just head north at the start they said. Quickest way to the strip they said.
---
They probably aren't cherry picking, it's usual practice to fix/change anything then write down what they fixed/changed. Most AAA companies do it this way, and you can't expect them to remember everything they changed. Sometimes changes just slip through the cracks
---
I say App-A-lashia. Live in on the west virgina border close to morgantown. Tbh say it how you want. No one knows the actual way to say it 😂
---
+Karma
---
I was saying this with my Fallout buddies earlier, got to represent the BoS.
---
Same thing happened to me, no there is no way to get them back in the game
---
It’s so you buy more atoms
---
Where you place your camp unit determines where you will spawn in upon fast travel. I don't know if its exactly where the unit is or if its a certain distance from it but try experimenting
---
Sadly if I had any mods to turn off, I would but I'm running the game for what it is except adjusting the settings to try and find the sweet spot but I think I give up, this is just one of those better-on-console games
---
They’re in capture gallery still, he just wants to be able to put them back into the game
---
Agreed but we also need better loot chances
---
Those things have so much health... too much!
---
Yep theres a new article down in the secret lab talking about this. My gf thought the same thing but didnt read the article. I do however think it was still used as a gag because then there is a holotape of Calvins death where he gets really awkward about executing the mating program. Could be a play on nerds making sex robots.
---
 You must be pretty dim.
---
Gimmie dat bb gun
---
Because they haven't made what players want. Faction decorations. Faction armor skins. Lots of people would pay for Ranger armor from Fallout New Vegas, or a Chinese Assault Rifle skin from Fallout 3 (assuming they make the assault rifle worth using that is). Bobblehead display shelf / case. Magazine racks. These things are already designed in the engine from FO4 and previous games, just need added here and given a price. Or maybe hair styles that people actually like - the kind of stuff modders did for Fallout 4 / new vegas that actually looks good.
---
Barely but yea, I'd just like more ways to get decent loot ,monster mash and ura ium fever are getting old
---
Carry a bunch of alchohol and have that one perk that revives with booze.   Then get a syringe and a whole set of doctor clothing and a mask and call yourself doctor tetnise.   Then from there you just need some medic guns and medic perks
---
Being stuck with 24 of the same players/accounts doesnt sound good. What happens when most of those people stop playing or only play once in awhile. And many other concerns with being stuck with such a small group of people.
---
Stringer gun*
---
You can get it by claiming the workshop at lakeside cabins
---
For me, it's not that these game impacting objects are being sold, but that existing skills/perks in the game were NEUTERED in order to make these repair kits more necessary. They literally made it so that armor would damage faster in order to sell these repair kits.
---
Very unprofessional and dishonest. Todd should be ashamed of himself.
---
Forgive my ignorance, but how is it costing you 2000 caps? I don't understand.  The entire quest completed for me after beating the event the first time so I don't know what I missed. I think this is a glitch that didn't allow me to actually finish the quest.  The whole quest line disappeared.  I didn't think it was over but I guess so.
---
And you’ll have them soon, for a nominal fee!
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Harness_(Fallout_76)
---
Exactly, people forget that in that same post the OP literally stated that he didn’t actually find a sheepsquatch, he used an asset replacer to switch out a deathclaw with the sheepsquatch.
---
Thanks!
---
I see this idea float around quite a lot and i do agree it would be nice.
---
Sadly, I think it's extremely unlikely it will ever be implemented.
---
Showing your local pictures on them would be easy enough, but if you want other people to see them as well, it would put too much strain on the network/servers.
---
It would be a nightmare to code that into the structure of the current game, and would take massive effort.
---
Could you be more specific? What guns and perks do you mean?
---
I'f you want another assaultron recall card to fight the imposter then it costs about 1950 Caps to buy another one.
---
Guess i will uninstall the game and go play something else. Tired of these game breaking bugs.
---
True but I wanted to see the cryptid take a shit.
---
Next patch the rival faction bots will start chasing each other around like in Watoga...
---
Dress for excess!
---
Not working? Says that there are no Bethesda users with that name
---
[removed]
---
Try to unequipt all perk cards aswell as put the guns in your stash then back in your inve
---
You could look to Conan Exiles for a pretty good system
---
On my way home I'll double check my username.
---
I let it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bc7dd9/investigationnew_shear_terror_map_locations_and/) as you guys may see it, I've done an intense work on the new map found in-game (it is different from the one shown in the Roadmap).
---
Aight
---
But people doing that could definitely eventually be an issue, though minimized if there are a lot of servers
---
I got the same thing from a radroach, so the patch made it worse but before that I was still getting diseases like crazy anyway.
---
I'm SO tired of catching Rad Worms!
---
It always seems to be north of your unit at the end of the circle. Seems about right.
---
Well done, this is brilliant really well put together and really detailed and has stuff like the moth man just because calvin mentioned it.  Great stuff man
---
I *think* “Shopping Mall Vendor” is actually Watoga... which makes even less sense. I agree with you 100% though, dropping all the vendors in randomly has ruined the unique feel of Whitesprings and its individual shops. Plus it’s basically pointless now that the cap pool is shared. Like, what’s the point of visiting Harper’s Ferry or Watoga/Phoenix now? Why even bother creating unique shops just to make them obsolete?
---
Thank you!
---
How pricey? I might have one. Single star max level.
---
WHY ARE YOU YELLING?
---
It's an explosive though?
---
I woudl use a medics combat rifle or handmade.   And make sure ur perks are specifically into charisma and luck.     Also try to go for perks that make your crit bar fill faster and crits do more dmg.    And also perks that heal allies when you use aid
---
Other games do too. Konami had this same issue with MGS V
---
I would love to strike down all these spoiler post, but I'm not a mod. Honestly even if we just had 1-2 dedicated mods that would implement that then in a week or twos time most people would be flagging stuff correctly.
---
I've been saving all 3 stars, have a mule full and working on a second now. Transferring 1 stars is just too much work.
---
Apple Latch Ya!
---
First time I did this event we failed it, and I was so sure that I'd never win it. Just beat it two times, both times I took over the pylons with my teammates. SO easy lol
---
Build it and they will come... for real though, activate it and watch people flock to you
---
They have a perk that fixes that or you can get plague walker. So many people have so many complaints about the annoyance of surviving a post nuclear apocalypse. I can say that I don’t use disease cures or antibiotics and I’m melee. Most of those diseases don’t really affect you to much as it is. I can only think of a few that I’d pop a disease cure for.
---
Yeah i wasn't even lvl 50 when i joined this event and i had to activate these pilons even though there were a lot of people above lvl 100 and 200.i wasted so many stimpacks
---
Just make sure ur name is doctor tetnis
---
And flashlight colours!
---
There's a holotape of the incident. Comedy gold.
---
1* starting at 2500. I've seen God roll 3* quad Tesla going for over 15k
---
Thanks a lot! It was a real pain in the ass to make LMAO
---
You could also consider including a system that gradually (or perhaps abruptly) reduces the percentage chance for getting a certain perk card once you already have a given number of said card (e.g. five).
---
So, for example, once you have five of a given card there is still a chance of you getting a duplicate, but, you're building in little bad luck protection to reduce the likelihood of it happening and, as a result, increasing the chance that you'll get something new and different.
---
U can use aid like alchohol.     Or get unyielding armor which gives you like a 10% boost on meale when low health
---
I think I’ll go back in that shallow grave and have a lie down for a bit.
---
Yeah it’s hilarious. Although the implications of getting torn apart by a horny sheep-assaultron is horrifying.
---
Good luck doing an event that not enough people will do. I’m not going to do hunter/hunted 5 times when it’s hard enough getting enough people one time. And I don’t feel like trying to play the game with the chance I’ll randomly be pulled from what I’m doing so don’t feel like just leaving it on and hoping at some point to get enough.
---
I had to order a set of these after seeing this thread.   They came today.  I've already framed them, but now I'm feeling like they're too nice for the garage.  Guess those family member photos are coming off the walls in the hallway!
---
also give us all the crops that are available please
---
It happens so much I've just started saving the disease cures for the more severe ones. I'm constantly running with the feral ghoul one

Always forgot about it

"*I was griefed by a high level player. He thought I couldn't see him but he followed me around while I was a level 7 and would shoot things when lots attacked me!*"
---
^ Genuine comment I saw a while back.
---
In all seriousness though... I agree with you. We'd have level 4s turning up to fight the queen and stuff. The posts are bad enough here sometimes. Let alone if that happened.
---
Well I use power armour but I do have a small mountain of booze in my stash so thanks.
---
Thanks! Good to know I wasn’t way out of line. She acted like she didn’t know what I meant. 
---
“You mean Ap-il-at-cha?!?”
---
I can’t repair any of my weapons whether it be guns or Melee,  when I go to the weapon repair station it doesn’t even show a list of the materials that I need there’s no way to repair it!!! What crap I won’t even play the game now I’m finished. Oh well I got the level 168 and the game is finally pissed me off
---
Bc I need to know man lol
---
Same
---
What do you mean saving for rerolls?
---
Dont use it like crazy tho.  It doesn't stack
---
If I got paid what they did for what they did..I'd be like tag me mofos..keep me busy let the big bosses see I'm wanted and working
---
Couldn't agree more but all these poonanos keep on whining so..
---
I think a 2x2 platform with a ten would be great, put some bookcases for a counter and maybe a bench or something. You can make a wall next to it or something and put prices and a sign :)
---
Well, you need a 4x4 foundation for a tent, you can fit the basic crafting benches inside that. That's probably the biggest you'd want to go, for placement sake.
---
Because they're all probably running the super duper awesome bloodied build with 50 hp that would get 1 shot by boss lol
---
I thought it said in the most recent inside the vault that you can craft film to hang your photos in your camps
---
Have you recently updated this list based on changes since?
---
I would have told her stay in her lane and get you the damn beer!
---
But also make sure you have nerd rage aswell as the perk that gives you more dmg per kill
---
Oh the things it will become my friend. Clipboards, adjustable wrenches, and toy cars are your friends.
---
Gore bags from the mutants..skulls with pikes..maybe a coffin to sleep in I've seen these items already in game..be great for camp purposes
---
Cjeck peoples levels by quickly glancing atound the map, the second time someone started it while I was there most were under level 20 we failed bad.
---
Yes I had that issue also it took me a month to get all the materials I needed to equip a jet pack mod. For my X O 1 Armor you’re exactly right it just clicks and clicks and clicks and does not craft it even though I have all the materials I need and finally today I went to repair some melee weapons and I can’t repair them either so I checked out one of my guns can’t repair it either the odd thing about that is it doesn’t even show a list of the materials required to repair it this is just pure crap armor you’re exactly right it just clicks and clicks and clicks and does not craft it even though I have all the materials I need and finally today I went to repair some melee weapons and I can’t repair them either so I checked out one of my guns can’t repair it either the odd thing about that is it doesn’t even show a list of the materials required to repair it this is just pure crap!!
---
Cynical: Distrustful of others’ motives
---
You’re cynical because you assume the challenges are harder to make us buy more atoms. You’re distrustful of their motives for making more difficult challenges
---
Yea I ken, Ill use it at the queen and the furry assaultron
---
I agree. I'm trying to build my raider camp close to top of the world and I'm disappointed by the lack of junk walls you can place like in 4. Along with no pole spikes with impaled skeletons, cages, or severed heads. Chicken wire fences for perimeter walls isnt very raidery
---
I have the mods sitting in my stash to make it a flaming dual bar. The second I get it.
---
Also list platform
---
That's a robot armor set, isn't it?
---
Damn. I'll unload that this weekend if I get time. I have a Vampire's SS Sledgehammer too. What would that go for?
---
I do WhiteSprings club house, easy to kill and many ghouls. If there s a nuke, it rains legendaries
---
The new excavator skin did it for me...but I'd really like to see more dark and serious options as well
---
Bubble is now officially burst... 😕
---
Should I say things along the lines of "What's a PHD?" and "Your test results are in, it's tuberculosis!" whenever reviving someone too?
---
I tried that it doesn’t fix the issue I drop them pick them up I put them in my stash box tried to craft it took them out of the Dash box no effect whatsoever this game is finally broken
---
Did you read the article? How this is rated to any regulation in Japan?
---
Just an article about Konami setting expiration date. Nothing more.
---
&gt; There’s currently no explanation or reasoning behind this new scheme which makes this all the worse
---
That's not true at all. 
---
Ultracite does much less damagethan normal lasers with slightly higher firerate.
---
I'll go try it. Couldn't get a legendary to a fissure so might as well.
---
Sorry I’m on PS4, same name on there as here

You can get excavator at 25.

Then you don't do it.
---
OR... and this is going to be a stretch...
---
You find some sort of community site where people that play the game gather to talk about stuff... and you make a post looking for three other people who want to friend up and jump on the same server and pop the challenge out real quick.
---
I guess the hard part here would be finding this mythical site.
---
Yes he is correct I tried. EVERYTHING He did and many more things for hours believe me guys it’s broken
---
Yeah it's got all robot gear and the eye bot helmet
---
No worries, just wanted to make it easier to find a group.
---
I can’t activate it unless I’m in a group
---
Yeah gee, we can get 10atoms per day easily. That’s totally reasonable. Even if you get the 60 atoms a day it’s still a trickle to get atoms and you are completely ignoring the observation that daily’s are getting harder. And that this is a well known f2p game tactic to get you to just give up nd play. 
---
I’ve been really wanting some of the upcoming atom store stuff and even doing most the dailys has taken up most my playtime this week. It’s getting the point the game is a grind and I either give up on getting the stuff in the atom store or I just give up on this game (Bethesda won’t get my money while they plan on letting you buy repair kits online. Pretty soon with that even if you don’t want atoms the game will be annoyingly grindy just to keep up with repairing your stuff).
---
As far as i know theres currently no way to get the postcard poster or most of the mounted head plans other than the 4 set ones from quests. They are definately not from the event though, its possible there is another source. Since noone has found any tho its unlikely
---
Yeah but people never want to join if you ask
---
There’s usually mostly complete  lvl45 Raider PA at gorge junkyard.
---
Just need lvl 3 lockpick.
---
Yes I lost a lot of Violet flux by dropping not going to do that one again
---
3* level 50. 40% swing speed, vampire, and +1 Agility
---
So what’s bethesdas motives behind these changes then? I mean... what.
---
I haven't had any luck with crippling the sheep at all, but I've crippled the SBQ a few times in the past, to the point where she stopped attacking altogether.
---
Definitely.  Just Sovietwombl in random arma bullshittery.         And tell them your going to be their precision for the day
---
I just checked.  There is plans for everything.
---
Yeah looking at it now its tatlsjade
---
Lvl 25 for miner miracles and excavator, I think it’s 25/35/45
---
Who cares if its still a shit weapon with useless abilities.
---
Eye bot has a big antenna at the top no?
---
Yeah this is the most broken this game is ever been you are correct but the worst part about it is not that you cannot apply March I can’t even repair any of my weapons Melee  or guns. So it’s rather pointless to even play the game
---
You could probably get about 7500 for that. Maybe a bit more if you find someone who's doing a vampire build.
---
 It's a solid weapon but not the meta Melee build atm.
---
probably intended by bethesda, otherwise ppl just cheese this..
---
thanks for lmk
---
Sounds great.
---
Kinda wish some balance on explosive shotgun.Still too powerful.
---
It’s the diver suit from fallout 4 far harbour
---
- Uranium fever isn't as reliable as it used to be for 3\* Legendary Mole miners. Plus you'll never get anything better than level 35/40.
---
- West Tek is too much expense of time, bullets and stress compared to the payoff
---
- I have no opinion on Monster Mash
---
A better way to get quick legendaries is by events. Horde/Pack events almost always have a 3\* boss and by doing runs in the Mire &amp; the Bog you have the best chance of getting high level 45/50 loot.
---
You sure? Try to add me Grimmcowz248
---
Pipe pistol dream it is!
---
Yeah it used to double damage. Fun times. And by fun I mean unfun.
---
Level 160 here, every other card pack still has duplicates of one star cards like lockpick and hacker. Sometimes I'm extra lucky and get several lockpicks and hackers in the same pack.
---
I opted for not doing it. But when you can’t even get people to join when there is incentive to get atoms  (without having to go beg strangers to do it with you) then maybe instead of trying to force people to play it they should either fix it or stop expecting people to try it.
---
Daily/weekly challenges are the majority of my gameplay time anymore.  But if the challenges are too annoying, I just don't do them and log off.  Basically this means I'm less engaged in the game and closer to simply not playing at all. There's a sweet-spot where challenges feel like a decent reward for participating but beyond a certain point it begins to feel too much like work.  Increasingly, they seem to be missing the mark.
---
Hey, I'm Indonesian as well. I have no problem purchasing atoms or redeem the game code. No idea why you have difficulties. Perhaps ISP issue?
---
I like this post. We're all a team, all a community. We have to operate as one in order to achieve goals. My message would be to trust thy brother until they prove you wrong.
---
No one has ever destroyed my camp. No one has ever 'griefed' me. I'm a live and let live kind of player. Actually, I just don't want to be bothered. And I don't bother anyone else.
---
In team events, I have the ability to win it, but oftentimes, I just play a support role. The way I see it, if the team wins, I win too. Knowing I played a role in that is good enough for me.
---
Are these guys so smart and so intelligent that their patch to repair things actually finally broke this game boy oh boy
---
I believe this gonna happen when prestige leveling comes this summer.
---
I thought high endurance reduces chances of disease, AND perks
---
Platform mate. Gotta throw that out there
---
It's not robot, I think it's the diver as u/Can-I-Change-My-Name said

---
good method to farm nuke materials
---
Well i can tell you i know activating a us game key using a vpn followed by purchasing atoms using a vpn and us payment method has worked at least in the past as i have seen it work. I suppose if the game was originally not activated with a foreign key it might not work but honestly that would surprise me a bit.
---
I'll give it a shot the next time I take her on again and see how the damage is.  What you're saying makes sense, but I don't understand why they'd put in what is essentially a "combo meter" for an entire raid.  That doesn't mean I doubt you--it just means if that's the case, it would be really strange.
---
Watch rifle gaming YouTube he just did a video on this
---
Thank you! It fixed all but one...though I did have to log out and log back in in order for it to work
---
I’ll try repairing everything. As I’m not home right now, I will also try putting the generator on a foundation.
---
Well considering they're all bots and bots aren't affected by nuke zones it probably wouldn't do anything.
---
Ah yes you're right. I saw that in 4 once and then never again so I completely forgot about it. Thanks man
---
That's one reason I bulk my junk.  I also bulk it so I can quickly count how much I have and store exactly how much I want to hold on to and sell the rest.
---
It's been happening a lot. You have to pay around 2k caps to make a new recall card then find a server that isn't on an event cooldown.
---
I feel like it's more related to the new notification pop-up that happens when attaching mods.
---
I did the event after a nuke earlier and nothing noticeable happened besides the robots were all Lv52. There seemed to be less robots but I'm not sure if that's because people were actually killing them instead of just sitting on the roof doing nothing
---
No problem :)
---
Anytime man. Glad I could help
---
DarkDustyn I'll be on in 5 min
---
They don’t. They want you to buy atoms. Not saying this is acceptable. Though you know what? I would have preferred they not allow you to work for the atoms and have actual reasonable prices for the items (like a few bux for a skin) then what they are doing now. It would be less frustrating and make the game more fun when I can focus on the game and not annoying challenges some of which require luck for an event to spawn that rarely spawns or a legendary to spawn near a specific point or any of the others this week that require sheer luck.
---
No, you are not forced to combine them, but like lemon said, you can only use one at a time.
---
Ok cool I’ll be waiting
---
2k??? Where??
---
Well yea that's what the vpn is for, it's what a geek would use to bypass it, but id imagine you will also need a foreign payment method to make the actual payment
---
Kk
---
Can I jump into someone elses and get my sheep mask still???
---
So all it would do basically is make it so you have to spam radaways too huh
---
Yes.
---
Took me 7 damn hours to get the event. Took psychotats. Completed for me :)
---
Yeah I play solo, don't know anyone else that plays fallout or Xbox in general
---
This is very likely gonna be the case if anything like this does show up in game. Mostly because no one is gonna except going into some random C.A.M.P. and see some lewd photo someone manages to take to "decorate" their place. I mean I know that lewd and lascivious behavior is kinda the schtick with Fallout. However, with all the bad press behind the game as it is, a player being able to display a custom made gorey or graphic image would be a PR nightmare, I think.
---
Exactly! I’d love to see everyone else’s fun, glitchy or absurd photos!
---
TS used to do double. E used to add another 100% damage explosion. 200% with demo expert. Combine them all and you were doing 4x the damage of a non TSE. Shotguns were apparently even worse, as the explosion was reportedly full damage per pellet. There’s 8 pellets. That part may just be hype, though. TSE was bad enough without it.
---
What fix ???? there was no fixed today
---
Yeah it seems that way unfortunately 🙄
---
*Did you just say...*
---
***SOVIETWOMBLE?***
---
I didn’t think about that, hopefully that does come with the update!
---
And you’re naive if you don’t think they are trying to sell atoms. They are a company trying to make money. And trying to chase that microtransaction money they see EA and rockstar making. You’re a fool if you think they are doing this purely out of the kindness of their hearts or even just cause they care about people playing the game the right way.
---
You can do the Level ups together. For instance, I leveled up today in Whitesprings, while wearing sunglasses, while using chems.
---
Yes.     Yes I did
---
Yesyesyesyesyes please?
---
My build is my own thing I made in previous games called the Looter Build, specializing in weight and recovery, with sneaky breaking and entering as a side.
---
The idea is clearance sale looting an area clean and I’d love armor that shows my inner crazy wasteland survivor
---
I think other posts have mentioned that this is a current bug
---
Any vendor. You can craft the recall card at a tinkers bench but you'll be missing a component, which is what you get from vendors. Assualtron recall board I think it's called. They're in the misc section.
---
They’re not even talking about fixing anything and not being able to apply and armor mod is the least of the worries I am now today cannot repair any guns or melee weapons!!   I’m not the only one I have read many many people are having the same issue!   When I go to a weapon repair work bench and want to repair an item it does not even show the materials I need to repair it you can’t repair it!   This game is finally broken and I am finally finished with it if they are so intelligent that this is the kind of crap that comes out of a patch this game is finally had it
---
Wtf. That's so trash :(
---
There us one just starting in my game with a few high levels if you want to join on me
---
It’s not that they intended it that way, it’s just a side effect of how it works for single players.
---
all i can think of right now: [https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WkP7nXLccFE/V0SJ-TJ0AEI/AAAAAAABxRc/HxQPFyPOq\_kBBvJTO\_LQ1eJfuPOukxvpwCLcB/s640/Junklady.jpg](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WkP7nXLccFE/V0SJ-TJ0AEI/AAAAAAABxRc/HxQPFyPOq_kBBvJTO_LQ1eJfuPOukxvpwCLcB/s640/Junklady.jpg)
---
You have the perk requirements to equip it as well?
---
Was randomly reading your convo lol and you said “you would need a big laser for that” lol have you not seen how big the Gatling Laser is?? 
---
(Don’t worry I didn’t down vote you)
---
It should.
---
The new legendary vendor he's supposed to give you tokens to reroll legendary effects
---
Do u know that name
---
You wouldn't even need bloodied.
---
okay yeah, that's what i'm beginning to think too. thank you :)
---
While browsing this sub more, I just noticed someone else also posted about this earlier today. So it’s something people want, hopefully it can be implemented!
---
No apologizes needed friend. :)
---
Yep I have his issue too, incredibly frustrating! I was hoping they would fix it in the hotfix but apparently not.. (on Xbox btw)
---
I was doing this event last night. It’s so annoying now. I just manual aim a few shots and then they usually die or change to red.
---
But it was very annoying when the assaultrons surrounded the end elite that showed up, and I didn’t want to risk hitting an allied bot.
---
Im on PC and cant attach box mods to my weapons at all.
---
Yeah I had a full squad during beta at any given moment cause we had 6 people who played it but after release I grinded out the main story missions and got to level 50 while my friends were still at 20 before they uninstalled the game. Since then I've gotten rid of most of my charisma in favor of more rifle perks that I didn't have before. Sadly I play on PlayStation otherwise I would add you
---
Well it is April 11 right now and there are many more issues not just the pine box marked many many many people cannot repair their weapons now it is pointless to even play the game when this happens and yes it’s April 11 and they haven’t done squat about this and I haven’t even heard or read anywhere where they plan to
---
I have noticed exactly them same with all my weapons (grognak axe, medics sniper) it seems to be since there latest patch. 
---
Noticed a few bugs with this one. Something they will adjusted if noticed a lot I guess.
---
Good man
---
Ok
---
PC players "have" it.
---
Yeah. I saw "Level Up 3 times" yesterday and figured, oh that's pretty straight forward and clever, encouraging playing on multiple characters. Then realized I already had leveled up twice since I started playing in that session and then discovered all the crazy requirements that made getting a legendary fasnacht mask seem feasible in comparison. 
---
I feel that many of the challenges are created without considering viability. Such as Explore Appalachia for 7600 hours. Really. 316 days spent playing. And for what? 40 atoms max? I play 4 to 5 hours per day so I could finish it in about 5 years. And there's no guarantee the servers will still be up in 5 years. Either way, excessively demanding challenges should drop at least a hundred atoms to reflect the effort required. Why would something easy like taking a couple photos around caves be worth the same as something as difficult as leveling up while balancing on one leg, while naked, diseased with radworms, intoxicated in a team, with exactly 76 lb of items with all the team members inventories combined?
---
Your edit is inaccurate. I spent close to 30 minutes moving my camp unit for a better spawn location because I'm on a cliff and each time I moved it, my spawn location did change. Now I'm not falling off the cliff when I load in and I didn't have to pack up and replace my entire camp.
---
Bandoliers should like reduce the weight of ammo or hold ammo or something
---
Read reddit posts from the last few days.
---
Or. 
---
Mods are bugged since last patch. Plans are apparently good though. Which is a pain when you gotta toss a wad of caps for most of the worthwhile  plans.
---
Wait for Bethesda to fix it. Hopefully before they unban the dupers.
---
Sunshine meadows industrial farm. You do need power, so you’ll either have to power up Poseidon or make some generators.
---
Once again this is one of the most basic features of an MMORPG that should have been included at launch.
---
They wonder why there is no in-game economy....well player trading has been broken since beta.
---
Just click ok and wait a few seconds.   Should load after that.    I think it's when you put your system in rest mode when you were still ingame
---
Yes that’s correct but there’s a more serious issues and that and that being that I cannot repair any of my guns or melee weapons!!  Go to the armor workbench to repair my weapons it does not even show the list of materials required to repair it there is nothing I can do!!!  So basically yeah At level 168 I can play the game with crap weapons what’s the point???
---
Ive moved mine plenty in always spawn in the cliff rocks. I got fed up and tryed packing it it changed even though i put it back so idk.
---
Okay, but you can't deny that the necessary effort to coordinate all those factors is a lot more tedious than simply leveling up once. The old challenges were a way of Bethesda rewarding us for simply enjoying their game and playing at our leisure, and now they're just dangling the carrot in the hopes we're too lazy to try and get it.
---
Or you could go a few individual 1x1 foundations. I’ve tried this on a character I was playing mainly in survival.
---
I have my bed and tinker’s bench with a cook pit in one and then the other crafting benches in a other.
---
Another CAMP needs your assistance, General.
---
I am level 168 you’re darn right I have all the parts I need that is not the issue this game is broken my friend and as I’ve told many other people I can’t even repair any of my weapons now and I am not the only one this is happening to
---
Lol... only in Fallout.
---
“It’s just easier to eat people than carry food around~”
---
The thing is, I ran a good distance away from the event and it was still draining my health at the same rate.
---
I get so excited when I stumble across a 3 star legendary enemy... and then almost always get a crappy 1 Star piece that I’m just going to sell to vendors for like 14 caps lol
---
Servor is crashing rip
---
Then you aren't really who we're talking about. ;)
---
The hero we need
---
Hmm, did you rotate it at all? I just did it last night
---
Same. Tried this fix and it didn't work.  Likely will need to be patched.
---
Did you kill it? Is it hostile?
---
Yeah it wouldn’t let me join
---
Its larger than vault boy
---
I like [farming locations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca96uV8q4fw)  guide, the comments have some other ideas for spots too.
---
Yes, it was hostile so I killed it
---
It will still take some time to weed out the excess serums in the market. That's why you still see the cheap ones. There's still so many of them you can vendor right now. Maybe in a week or two the serums will be significantly more expensive for players.
---
Lol what a time to be alive, I feel bad for the guy who activated it.
---
Its always been there but its very rare.  I got one once a few months back.
---
I have not seen that yet. Where is your camp? I might go try and hunt one down.
---
There is a plan called Shadowed Leather Chest and Shadowed Leather Limbs I believe. I have also seen mods but that is a one time use.
---
Yep but even that is selective.Everybody uses weapons and armor.Make it too hard to keep it repaired in game and give an option to fix your gear with cash.Profit.
---
Got the helm first day and first go. Now I want the rest of the outfit. It's so cool!
---
It’s pretty crazy right?!?
---
I feel bad selling these items to the vendors, but I just don’t have the space to hold onto them anymore.
---
Not really sure what to do with them at this point.
---
For me it will play the first proc sound while I am in the crafting menu, then plays the rest after I exit. I have tracked more then 800 alcoholic beverages, counting how many I have mats for against the total crafted and have had no extras. I am sorry if that was not clear in the original post.
---
Oh and by the way don’t think it matters I have read this is not just one platform I am Xbox one
---
Exactly, I am of the mindset of 'let bygones be bygones'. I have had people come in teams to destroy my camp, I have claimed a workshop and had someone start the claim and their buddy assassinate me from behind. There are assholes in the game, just like in real life, but I like to believe the majority of the players would rather help or be left alone.
---
I typically don't start anything, a few times I've seen small bounties on the map and I pop over, stake out the situation, and if it looks like they got the bounty on accident I'll pop on the mic and ask if they want the bounty gone, I don't mess with their junk and because I mostly only go after 5 cap or 10 cap bounties so I take that as a convenience fee.
---
Otherwise, I don't go attacking people unless they attack me.
---
The game pushes at every step that we need to work together, hell most class-based or job-based games *require* people work together.
---
In a game like fo76, that allows such varied builds across the board, we all need to be less selfish during events and help our neighbor.
---
Even the people who are **actually** roleplaying as raiders work together with their fellow raider ^I'm ^not ^talking ^about ^'griefers' ^"playing" ^as ^raiders
---
Tldr no more selfish people, we need to work together.
---
To the selfish people; Convert now, or fall Forever.
---
SE of Big Fred's BBQ Shack, near the bridge over water
---
Its always been there. Just a low chance. Probably about 5-10% in my experience. But I haven't farmed a large amount so that may be very inaccurate.
---
ya dude we're just speculating, we don't have concrete evidence yet.  just chill it's gonna be ok
---
Tried once with Psychotats. No success. Tried again with Psychotats, a beer, Mentats, and Fury, still didn't work. Trying a 3rd time now.
---
Couldnt tell ya, was messing around with this like 2 weeks ago. All I know for sure is I always spawn in north of my camp. If I relog I spawn closer the center.
---
They are drastically overpriced, so stick to in game earned atoms.
---
Yeah, and it tells you when enemies are spawning and instead of the mutant standing up in my face I'm targeting a mole rat or scorched across the map while they flood the station.  I know it doesn't do it for the other Enclave events but I'm not sure about any others I haven't tested those yet.
---
I don't even want to know what had sex with Mr. Fluffy to make this creature.
---
I’m level 168 buddy of course I’ve got the correct perk cards! I’m not a newbie.  Seriously this game is broken I don’t care about not being able to apply at MOD today I can’t even repair any weapons!!!
---
Interesting, I believe it's a random drop from events but I'm wondering if anyone has acquired it and remembered how they got it.
---
I could not find it in the crafting menu either. Nor the Sasquatch poster either, now that it has released. Am I missing something?
---
please god
---
My routine used to be do the daily vendor run, do the daily challenge run, then get to having fun. Now I'm finding that the challenge run is taking closing to an hour rather than the 15 minutes it used to be, and I have to manually stop myself to realize I'm spending far too much time not enjoying myself for the sake of a few atoms. It's become more trouble than it's worth.
---
It was my go-to between 15 to 25. Much sentimental value.
---
Thanks for the input I appreciate it unfortunately I’ve contacted Bethesda there’s no plans to repair anything this game is friggin broken
---
Invite me again, I didn’t have time to click join
---
I just want to know why it keeps coming back! I've even switched servers
---
The stash size is 300%, not the player carry limit.
---
Whatever you have in your stash has zero impact on what you are doing currently ingame.
---
Also, you still have to farm all that stuff --you dont just magically get 300% more items.  Please read the whole post.
---
I wish you could trade them.
---
Assuming that the spawn point must be near by.
---
Cool, that's good to know.
---
It is an advantage that doesnt effect player power.
---
I actually found the frat poster! I think even the same day. Worst case just restart the client but just keep checking all poster categories. It should be there so long you got it in the Atom store first.
---
I may be wrong it's just what it looks like to me.
---
Guess so. Have you seen this yao guai before?
---
Had something similar happen the other night, had to go further into the weapon menu to repair. Does it give you the option to further view the weapon?
---
Nice, I love the personal insults.  Im glad you yield since you were not adding anything to the topic anyway.
---
Exactly what I thought xD. Take a photo of a mothman, fighting a wendigo, while intoxicated, during an event. 0/3
---
I have the plan, and can make them. 
---
I don't remember where I got it from though, just that the plan exists.
---
I'm so relieved.
---
There's a reason people don't do those events in the first place, and the solution isn't to pay people to do them once and only once, it's to fix them by making them fun and actually worth doing regularly.
---
So while you are defending your workshop you can go to your stash and have 300% more ammo, stims, etc. Then the other player that didn't pay. It's not a hard concept. Just admit you want pay to win. No one believes your bullshit.
---
Reminds me of the Green Goblin from Into the Spider-Verse
---
[And it explodes when you activate it](https://youtu.be/gzd2ifDDKQw)
---
Agreed with OP
---
There's a 3 hour cooldown period after an event has been run.  during that time, it does nothing and doesn't even give you a fucking clue WHY it's doing nothing.  Another awesome job by the FO 76 team.
---
This is where vampiric guns come in handy. I have a vamp explosive minigun and use blocker perk so I can tank the boss while being a conduit for all 3 pylons. Only really having to stim when I reload.
---
Cool this is the information I found. I believe it came from an event. 
---
https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Plan:_Shadowed_Leather_Armor_Arm
---
This is part of the secondary cryptic events that were added last patch.
---
Purchased atoms to get this on a whim, best purchase I’ve made so far
---
Good to know, thank you!
---
Is this one computer? That statue looks badass
---
Littlerly the same stuff you listed. Must be like the jackpot that comes up every now and then.
---
It's pretty annoying. I'm normally *always* in pacifist mode, have no real interest in PvP, but when there was slap damage I would use it to "gently coax" low levels out of the area. Running into similar issues in the new event, I'm not sure if more people make it harder but there's still a surplus of freeloaders pissing me off.
---
For further info, everything related to currency exchange is regulated by FSA (Financial Service Agency) in Japan.  Bethesda need to contact FSA then register their atom. It will be a painstakingly difficult considering FSA is a tight-arse bunch that will probably reject atom due to their naming regulation, security etc.
---
I don't remember buying it so that is plausible.  
---
I don't typically buy many plans, i remember buying the heavy combat armor and heavy leather though. So if Id bought the shadowed I'd think I'd remember it. I just can't be perfectly sure, humans have flawed memory and all.
---
I ended up completing it a while back in 8ish minutes. I feel like it’s only a 10/15 minute event in total though but it’s still super doable solo in just about 8 minutes. I think it relies on respawn rate a lot so using fast melee worked well for me! It also seems like it’s kind of chance based in just how many radtoads spawn rather than the fireflies. I hope you get it completed soon! Once I finally got it I felt so accomplished but never want to kill another firefly again!
---
I think people misunderstand this is the reason food/drink exists. You aren’t SUPPOSED to enjoy the mechanic. It’s part of the challenge. If you want to deal with it you can, but you can’t do both.
---
I’d love for people who hate survival mechanics to play a few hours of ‘The Ship’ and be forced to poop and clean.
---
I completely understand thank you
---
You aren't wrong, however It is damn near impossible to find certain sets of ingredients before some of them spoil. or at least that has been my experience. Even with fast travel (which in my opinion you should never HAVE to do). The Devs should go back in an re-tweak the math on some things that I'm sure unintentionally got changed when they altered the spoil rates on nuked flora/fauna.  I agree that you should have to go find the ingredients in question, but they need to stay fresh long enough to use them when you do.
---
Sad to say i have all max heavy guns card but not maxed out gatling (just normal base gatling with no mods) and it does 28 damage.
---
When the Roadmap came out I kinda figured the reason the pioneer scouts went missing was because of sheepsqautch. Kinda glad you didn't find sheepsqautch in the ash heap though. The savage divide feels much more like sheepsqautch territory.

I have completed the entire questline of the new content and also the side quests with success doing everything. I have never been given a card to make the event. I have never been redirected to the site where the event happens. Only discovered about it here and could not make a single event until now. So sad Bethesda. 😔
---
Seems like a whole lot of cloak and dagger for cryptid hunters, and they had access to some pretty advanced tech based on Calvin’s reactions in his terminal notes, makes me think they were foreign spies or something.
---
LOL. You're welcome.
---
American here, we don’t call them simply fountains either. Fountains are water features, drinking fountains (and really no shorthand) is what we call your “bubblers”
---
Turn on xbox. Go do something else. You don't need to be there for the whole downloading process. It's not a newborn making it's way into the world. Hell, go to the movies! Go outside! Make a roast dinner for your loved ones.
---
Rifle gaming did a video already
---
It's called VATS!
---
If they were hired by the government to clean up their escaped experiments there’s nothing they wouldn’t have.
---
Hmmmm?
---
On Xbox just completed the event while on Daddy-O for the entire thing. Didn't count, not impressed.
---
haha yeah...!   Or the Goblin looks like a Deathclaw with wings...
---
You're welcome. 
---
For events I typically run ones in the mire, and cranberry bog. Normally towards yhe lower right of the map so that might be a good place to look. I've had it for awhile though so take it with a grain of salt. 
---
If vendors I've most certainly got it from the grafton vendors as thats where I've gotten all of my armor plans. (Outside of scrapping)
---
i just bought it because of this
---
I've heard about the sheep head from the trailer, seen dudes with sheep hats. I get the event and I wasted 42 stims, broke all my armor, and busted my weapons for a white fedora and a 1* ghoul slayers level 40 golf club. If this ends up like the Fasnacht Parade I'll fucking riot.
---
Do you have all the best available mods attached? You should be able to get it around 50-55 energy damage when modded. I use my mutant’s Gatling plasma since it has better stats for now (does 118 energy damage)
---
Thx, but I mean like the beam size not the gun. Imagine halos spartan laser firing kinda size
---
Are you not aware of Fisto?
---
It’s all random. You gotta keep completing it to get different rewards.
---
At whitesprings?
---
Thanks for the info. I've been running events but not much luck of getting plans. I'll check grafton thank you
---
Tried it after I saw the video. Makes it easy but good luck finding the body haha
---
Best of luck, friend.
---
I really don’t think it was his intention to have sex with the robot. There is a note nearby and other hints that suggest he is trying to create a fake Sheepsquatch and program it with mating rituals and calls and use it to lure the real Sheepsquatch.
---
Same time Lumber mill up in Northwest Corner had a red nuked circle around it....
---
Hahahaha yeah. I may have ummmm.... tested it for quality purposes.
---
Ah, gotcha.  I doubt there's a way to bring them back in without some sort of mod support and access to the system by mods.
---
Problem is, I see neither poster now lol. I'll keep an eye out. I have not restarted since purchasing it from the atom shop, so there's a chance that could be the issue. I swear I saw the frat one once though before! 
---
Thanks for the reply after such a long time ago that you made your comment!
---
So they want me to waste all the items I have compiled since beta, and spend 2000k caps for a CHANCE at getting something other than a basic hat?
---
Why are you spoiling for those reading this? :/ 
---
And no. By the way, he sounded. He was giving another Hint.
---
If your talking about the laser one you need to use energy perks
---
If you're still on my ign is SnobbyNoob I can craft one for ya.
---
Burrows yes. Camera meh.
---
yeah that's also why I got one myself, but haven't been able to test it myself yet.
---
Just joking. I do use it, though. High agility, revolvers, Concentrated Fire and Gun Fu allow me to rapidly headshot multiple enemies in VATS for increased damage on esch successive target.
---
Oh, didn't know there was a max. Im maybe at 36 or so.
---
I can't even stay alive or in the game to complete it. I either die and can't respawn or as I am loading back in my game freezes cause of all the stuff going on. Only reason I got some event items is cause I found them in the vendors in white springs. Still need the full imposter set and plans for the fixer but will I get them myself nope and considering how high people are selling them for I probably won't get them.
---
Until they get around to fixing more of the bugs and balance issues in this game I really think they should try to keep the challenges vague and reliant on simpler (100% known to be working properly) game mechanics.  They can require significant effort to do, preferably with an equally significant reward, but they HAVE to be doable without being completely dependent on the player's luck with the game's RNG, and preferably without requiring lots of out-of-game information, server hopping, or wonky workarounds.
---
For instance, instead of kill 5 rad ants while drunk on rad ant lager, make it kill 20 insects while intoxicated.  Instead of killing a glowing creature while in a rad storm, make it kill 5 diseased creatures while diseased/10 super mutants while mutated/etc.  Instead of completing the Battle that Never Was event while wearing a civil war era outfit, make it complete 3 events while wearing a piece of civil war era clothing or wielding a black powder weapon/revolutionary sword.
---
To keep more of the theme, they could even add some story-lite flavor text which uses some of the more specific examples and recommends locations to the player.  For instance, a blurb by Roselynn talking about that one time she visited Fort Prickett and a fight broke out between her raider gang and another group during which a bunch of robots dressed up in civil war uniforms fought along side them, and after winning David decided to take a particularly helpful nanny bot with them to reprogram...
---
There are just a lot of ways this could be done better.  As it is I suspect they're just going to end up with challenges being mostly ignored instead with the way they're going.
---
So you engaged him in pvp and lost. Cool.
---
Honestly, if better communication doesn't do it, then I'm all for this.
---
Bloodied/Stealth Builds might be Meta in most things in 76, and this event already does a lot to avert that with all the exploding bots.
---
Make people learn that you can't just cheese every encounter with high DPS.
---
That's cool
---
2k out of 180k subs, could be its just a extremely loud 2k people. 2k out of 1.4 mil copies sold after launch?
---
while wasted and naked, of course.
---
If it has a timer on it, get it while you can.
---
Transparent as a phonebook? Bud they update their website frequently saying what is a limited time item or not.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6zK9b9qMb0kWcnBxUNJOlB/atomic-shop-patch-8-items-and-sales
---
bloodied pve build ensures even if the whole server is there, you can kill the queen :D
---
Its bs
---
I'm familiar with the word. It's not the word he used. It's not a shortened form of it.
---
I'm lazy. What's the system?
---
It doesn't sound like instanced. It's sounds to me about as difficult as nuke silos.
---
It's one area I think that the player base of most Bethesda games are so used to cheating through the challenges and from day one can do unlimited resources and never have to struggle once, playing the whole thing in God mode. 
---
This isn't even as hard as FO4 survival mode, so I don't understand what most people complain about most of the time.
---
Looking at the link above I may have gotten all three via Fertile Soil come to think of it... same with deep pocketed leather.   
---
If you don't get them and want them I can make both and all types of leather armor, let me know.
---
I haven't. It's new to me too and not finding anything on an immediate search so possibly part of the new questlines.
---
I always thought it was gas tbh always made sense to me the Sonic attack going thru buildings always confused me
---
Man I wished I had atoms! :( I run a BOS clan and those stairs would be perfect! I was thinking of saving my atoms up to see if I can get my hands on another limited time power skin. But I’m at 400 now and some of these challenges are ridiculous. I wish Todd came from the heavens of the clouds and gave me 5000 atoms points.
---
Wes tek and ws Nukes also like running the mine near fissure site prime
---
You could, OR you could just server hop. It's all by chance. I got it in 4 tries. Also, how are you poor if you've played since beta?
---
Check your career challenges there may be a few you haven't done that are easy
---
I found the modding challenges the easiest way to farm caps. Apply a paint or cheap mod to the required weapon, rinse and repeat for those sweet sweet Atoms.
---
I had great fun. Still got waxed. Lol. I'm level 163. She owns my melee build.
---
That’s like saying a level 20 should not be at the WS golf course. They paid for the same game and same opportunities as you. 
---
That’s just self entitlement and needs to be nipped in the bud. 
---
Maybe next time assemble a Team or two and go for it?
---
But I'm melee build
---
Ooh, did you get any good propaganda?
---
Im not really going to energy heavy weapons. Im using energy heavys like gatling and plasma to save ammo until i have enough to use my bloodied gatling gun. I dont have alot of energy cards in my build.
---
There’s a terminal in I think Sugar Grove that hints at the fact that the government was interested in tracking down these cryptids, so possibly the company that Calvin and Wolf and BoPeep worked for (Bysshe?) was a government run initiative
---
Health wise easy. But she murders people compared to the sbq
---
That's what I use, but after having it nearly dead and repairing twice I ran out of god damn aluminum. I figured, Oh, they can take off the last FOURTH of it's health in ten minutes, surely. Nope. I didn't understand what was going on until I looked at who I was fighting with and it was a bunch of between lvl 25 - 45 idiots and a lvl 108 guy who I have no idea what he was doing. Not shooting the damn Queen, that's for sure.
---
Maybe. But I’m sort of demanding atoms st this point. I don’t like to spend money on games that I already paid for. And I like buying things that I can actually HOLD. Idk.
---
It’s a random chance that happens.
---
Happened to me once. No one believed me. All the items dropped were super low level so I just sold all of them.
---
You're clearly clueless and made it to 37? Cooler, lol.
---
I've seen it overtaken by liberators a time or two, but eyebots...? that's new.
---
Exactly. She is horrid for my melee build.
---
In my opinion they need to massively overhaul the scorchbeast screech. Without power armor I get 2 or 3 hit by it not to mention diseases as well as how hard it is to avoid with all the bugs. At least now they don't spam them as much but it still seems to happen too often
---
Oh ok, I tough it was lower lol. But yeah I mean, you know how Bethesda is. Never works at first
---
It's a legal compliance issue, with the same series of laws. I know reading comprehension is difficult but try to keep up.
---
Was holding Grafton and had the defend event from mirelurks. With buchers bounty I made 75 mirelurk steaks that sold for like 500c with lvl 3 hard bargain.
---
Same thing happened to me. Also got protectrons. It was funny because they were all in the same spot acting just like the ghouls lol
---
Finished one too quick today, people missed out. Just took a bit for people to figure out. Take a pylon and kill the bots, or get a gun.
---
Yeah. But those are random. I get really odd challenges where I literally have to claim half of the workshops on the whole map. I’m trying to get the power armor statue but bassically I’m just getting really demanding for them lol. I just want Todd to come from the clouds and give me like a million atoms or something. Also I played the beta and literally didn’t get anything rewarded for playing it.
---
It's a 1\* Bloodied Hunting Rifle, I assume? Do you still have it? I could give you 4K for it.
---
I mean you always have a chance of getting something. The chance of getting the better gear is lower, but it’s not like the fasnacht where it was completely impossible. If you’re with a group that actually activates the conduits and deals damage instead of standing around then it’s not too hard as long as you go into it knowing you’re pretty much expected to die a few times. 
---
Plus gaining caps is much easier to do now that all the vendors have shared a shared caps pool. 
---
I had a decent bit saved up so I’ve definitely taken a hit in the past few days in my supplies, but Im still holding up. I do think the 2200 caps or whatever it costs to buy the card to repeat it is excessive, but since it’s fairly new it’s likely it’ll pop up at least once in a couple hours
---
Press your equip button ps4 press "X"
---
Well, the problem is we’re supposed to be wierd people. Vault 76 was filled with independent, headstrong smart people. If you read all the lore we’re kind of the worst of the smart people. It was meant to improve the odds of survival. I can see a few breaking off and making communities but for the most part we’re assholes.
---
Only steel drops for me, other than the 1* legendary medics cutter
---
Yeah. I feel like getting instakilled in power armor was silly. like 20 times. Lol. Doesn't take long to kill but she's a glass cannon.
---
At least we can suffer together
---
I have seen nearly everything go through solid walls in 76.... Myself included. Games bs
---
Typically they only grow in the wild near a water source as far as I know, and since they haven't seen fit to give us planter boxes well... I hope they add planter boxes, and then silt bean cab be grown in camp.
---
You can't drop or trade items with Atom Shop skins on them.  If you're just trying to get in it you have to use it and place it.
---
I'm sure that it's probably meant for people who are still in the lower levels.    But other than that.   Yah it's kinda just a gimmick
---
Holy crap you’re a life saver, is that a new feature from the patch?
---
Her health is low but she does 20 times the dmg of the sbq. And roofing it is boring.  The gutsies are crazy too.
---
Out of the loop, haven’t been playing FO76 but I thought the Cryolator was a prototype made by the overseer of Vault 111?
---
My team and I farmes white springs four about 2 nukes worth and this happened. Pretty sure its some kind of anti grind feature or code bug and eye bot. Is just idcode 1 or something
---
Only if you fight a lot of mobs
---
If you want to go die at Whitesprings, it doesn't cost anyone else anything. Event mooching does, is rude, silly, and needs to be level gated. If it didn't raise the difficulty of the fight and cost other people THEIR opportunity to complete an event I would agree. But it does, so it needs fixed. How can you argue with that? It's just good game design and common sense to keep lvl 1 characters out of an end-boss fight.
---
SAME
---
What the heck? Thought this was supposed to be more end game type content. That's disappointing.
---
Same issue here on PS4, cant attach my deathclaw gauntlet mod even though I bought it from vendor, have the perk and everything.
---
I wasn't talking about dailies, but I guess you've done the combat related quests. The dailies are getting quite rediculous.
---
Weird. I got several legendaries but as I said they were all garbage so not really a good thing. I'm not sure what causes it though.
---
Always been that way its just that you put atom shop stuff on it.
---
Technically if you drop power armor its unowned if you "equip" it should be auto flagged to you.
---
The sheepsquach is a real creature.  It just hasn't bean added yet
---
How many star you got into rifleman
---
You cant get killed in adventure with pacifist on now. This guy was in survival, asking for it, then complained when he got rekted.
---
Cool I run ws a lot I can give it a try there
---
Lol afraid not.    76 wont release a craftable weapon the towers over a legendary version of it.     It's just the way they operate
---
Damage is crazy, think I only finished the event 1 time without dying. Full health I can just avoid instant death. Jumping is risky, stun landings kill me the most.
---
I would say that's about the only place it's useful
---
6 but even if I had 9 I cant imagine it would be that much better.
---
Yea I tried Wes tek and I was like no way this is working here
---
Yeah I kept the PAs as my toon leveled.  Passed it down to my alts, but even then they out grew them as well.
---
same :\^)
---
2000k caps to do what?
---
Have you run Xbox me run PlayStation 😂 but yeah I really like how people are coming up with ideas to add on to this as if it’s going to be a feature 😂
---
I agree. I guess it just bugged me that we get tasked with “re building” America and the only re building we is when some pinhead with an explosive weapon comes to our camp.  
---
At least with a community, we could attempt to do that. Build something that we all could use. 
---
Even if only a spoonful of people do build on such a thing.
---
Oh yeah I know, this was just a creative thought. You think he'll show up in the burrows?
---
Reading is really hard for people. More so when information is handed to them.
---
lol have you been dropping your PA this whole time ...you do realize someone could have just jumed in it when you did that
---
LOL, legal compliance of what? Which series of laws?
---
Where this is mentioned in the article? Source of these "laws"?
---
I'm not saying it should be God tier but jeez this thing is weak.
---
Sounds about right
---
Hmmm.  Personally no. I think he will be more like mothaman. And drop some average loot but just be a cool creature
---
its also amazing for taking out groups of mobs at the new event il use it to help keep the conduits alive
---
Also a tab for food that is separate from chems.
---
Opposite problem here. It shows materials needed but the window that shows the stats on damage and such is completely blank so theres no way to know what upgrade to use.
---
Give use terrariums to grow fungi etc too, they can require power to balance ot out.
---
Well it's only week if your not in the right build.   Like I could probably get the dmg up to like 500 plus
---
Really? I’ll Have to give it a try tomorrow when I craft another recall code.
---
Some people use to abuse this glitch by requesting tons of items then screwing around with the list to have this happen. I've seen it done a few times with plans.  They'll request a dozen or so plans then something super pricey hoping it'll be mispriced. The "trade changed on server" but was supposed to help prevent this.
---
Should be
---
I haven’t seen it on Xbox
---
Pretty sure I got it just from scrapping a bunch of leather armour
---
Best 5 dollars I've spent in awhile. More of stuff like this please Bethesda.
---
This is why I love this event. It causes people to rethink their builds and gear and creates a dynamic that varies from SBQ. Making previously underused legendary affixes viable for the encounter. With the flexibility of perk cards it definitely helps as well.
---
No. It's a FO:NV reference.
---
Whatever, can i have your stuff ???
---
Buzz blades are my cryotonite. They shred the slow spongy queen. But the assaultron is fast. Really fast.
---
The most obnoxious thing with Scorchbeasts is how the bastards have seemingly no roam limit. Fuckers'll follow you from the Mire to the Ash Heap and back.
---
And I don't know what it's like when you're post-LV50, but at 37 there's basically nothing I can do about them.
---
They shake VATS lock too easily or stay out of its grab range, free-aiming at them is rough because only parts of them seem to be hitboxes (their wings seem to not be valid targets at the very least) and even when I can hit them consistently, I can burn hundreds of rounds and barely inconvenience them.
---
This whole sub is people asking for features.
---
You are all paying beta testers. Genius Bethesda...
---
I very highly doubt that. You could only have 3 more damage perks than me. And even with full unyeilding and low health you arent going to increase a rifles damage by 5 times.
---
His soothing voice
---
Tremendous post
---
They do exist but its not released yet. All marine helmets are from the devroom and some people got banned for having items from the devroom
---
Of course they managed to break one of the more compelling elements of the game. Oh well, no forceful stock for my husband and no increased ammo capacity for me...
---
That is simply excellent.
---
no its my X-01 Armor, and it will apply it to my LEFT arm, doesnt even show up greyed on the other pieces
---
Oh man! I'm going to have to do armor too.
---
Oh yes much luck! To pro! Savage randoms!
---
How is he clueless?  Were you in survival?  If so, that's on you. If not, then you must have done something to flag the guy for PvP, or that allowed him to flag you.
---
Underrated as hell post.
---
Yeah I did the Brotherhood of steel around level 40 myself and as a rifle build with 3 points in endurance only for the cannibal perk I didn't enjoy  them too much. Once my group if friends tried to get a scorchbeast to follow us to vault 76 but it eventually stopped following but their follow range is way too far
---
Yeah but lugging around 3 pound fusion cores isn't really the best thing to be doing at such a low level.
---
Oh, that makes sense why I haven’t seen one
---
I'm just glad it's not a new feature, also that I'm not crazy
---
&gt; Anti armor knuckles: tunnel snakes rule
---
yesssssssss
---
Excellent list.
---
They have some pretty interesting characters in 76. I wonder how illusive he'll be, I haven't seen a flatwoods monster since I started the game
---
I was level 15 and clearing the golf club just fine. Crossbow and throwing knives. Didn’t die or break a sweat. 
---
All level gating does is make the fight easier by forcing people high enough to do it. And with that they just bring their queen killer gear and beat it in 8:00 or whatever. Which is not the way to go. 
---
Again setup a team or two and rely on them to actually do the event.  
---
People are going to show up theirs even if you level gate the event. There’s no way to force people out without erecting a barrier.
---
I meen it's not that hard. Just sit my ass on the ground and snipe em at night with sandman on and boop there is like a 3.125× bonus.   Then just add an extra perk or to and your there
---
Does Jeffery carry it around with him for you in his pants?
---
It was a joke, guys. Nvm...
---
Only if you consider steel scrap propeganda
---
I'm not talking 500 raw dmg. But overall 500 dmg by Time that bullet hits their dome
---
Is it just with mods you already have in your inventory, or crafted mods as well?
---
&gt; Little story I have over 700 lbs worth of weapons on my character 
---
Lord almighty, waiting for the legendary tokens?
---
It's in the reddit thread, dipshit.  Or do some basic googling. You have to expire microtransaction currency in Japan. The reddit thread explains that Konami didn't inform their users of that, and had to make the changes pointed out in the article.
---
Yah.  And the guide said there were aliens.   But we have only gotten teasers.    Mainly the kne in the taxedermy shop
---
These are good!
---
I can only hope there comes a point where they're as much of a nuisance as dragons were at a certain point in Skyrim so I can go hunt them down, get a little revenge.
---
But more so still when they just don't know where to look. My gratitude knows no bounds! Thank you :D
---
Please let me have the green hud like fo4! I miss it and it makes the game more "falloutish" in a way I cant explain!
---
You can play off server crashes/disconnects as your character being a narcoleptic lol
---
Best list ITT (other than mine of course).
---
Couldn't ask for better info than that. Much obliged! :D
---
; ; 
---
The FBI will be there soon.
---
I have couple, one with the charging shotgun mod, use it at whitesprings great for the tagging mobs and a TSE w/90% weight reduction that is a absolute beast. Not many mods for it, shotgun, lobbing barrels and from what I understand you can't get mods by scrapping the rifles. They are a fun weapon
---
&gt; AA death tambo: JingleJangle
---
I need to know if you're rocking a cowboy theme here.
---
Really great at pvp but the auto one burn through ammo
---
Yo, give me something like mothership zeta and I will lose my fucking mind
---
lmao
---
I find dupe cards to be useful. Here’s a scenario:
---
I only have four luck. I normally run lvl 3 Class Freak cause mutations and 1 lvl of the perk that randomly repairs my gun. When I need to remove rads, I do it when I can swap out a few cards to have Starched Genes. 
---
I also have a lvl 2 Class Freak for nuke zones when I need to pop radaways on the fly. So I can run Starched Genes 2 and Class Freak 2 in nuke zones. My negative mutations are slightly more present but not gone. And I can pop radaways.
---
Also they only exist on PC, as consoles had no access to the dev room
---
Oh
---
Really? Because they always post information on the same places all the time. I book mark them. As well as follow the official accounts on Reddit.
---
If you are wasting that much stimpaks you REALLY need to evaluate your playstyle.
---
Came in looking for a "The ____ is too damn high!" meme and left disappointed.
---
I live and play in Japan you fucking moron. I know the laws here. 
---
There is no such thing as "You have to expire microtransaction currency in Japan". Just Konami trying to make more money. And nowhere in the fucking thread or Google someone is talking about that regulation that does not exist.
---
Fortnite, Apex Legends, Ubisoft... does not have this problem in Japan.
---
lost count after 20 hops. leveled from lvl 220 to lvl 221 just by killing mobs there so there was a lot of server hopping. had one mirelurk king that didn't follow me and one supermutant that was stolen from me at fissure site by another guy. i've tagged mutie but it didn't matter. and that's pretty much it. fuck this challenge and fuck bethesda.
---
Rod further clarify, in the top floor executive office.
---
What is it? How long is it on the shop for?
---
Looks like you're gonna have to buy some Atom store vaccinations!
---
It all started with people being unhappy about how small/random the vendor plan selection was. Their genius fix for that was to make almost every plan in the game available all the time but raise the prices, paying zero attention to the impact of the 200 cap vendor limit.
---
Welp definitely don't roll over to Survival yet, it's a lot like that except with people like me killing you before you ever see me.
---
And I shall do the same. Still pretty new to all this, so every little bit of info helps, even if it seems obvious, so thanks again
---
its not fullproof because randoms, but if the mobs dont spread way out your team can basically ignore eyebombs/protectrons  when someone uses it. (i have one to weak to deal with the gutsys)
---
It could be. I assumed acid because of the sizzling noise it makes and how the particulates look; it seems to behave more like a falling liquid than a gas. That, and having a gas mask on does nothing.
---
But I also realize I'm arguing logistics on green shit that comes out of a bat-dragon's armpits, so.. it could well be gas anyway, lol.
---
And a higher AP cost too iirc.
---
New to this but know enough to insult Bethesda like someone who’s been around long enough.
---
Yea they screwed up on that, it’s just sprinting lol
---
PC.
---
I've modded some weapons like combat shotgun just fine, armor ect. 
---
But I've crafted the mods, not used existing ones. I have some mods, I might try to remember to check if I can apply them.
---
Speaking of being new to things, is there a way I can close this thread? This is also probably obvious...
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_legendary_effects
---
Oh OK! I didn't know this thread was just for regressions.
---
Have you seen the portions of microwave tv dinners? They're tiny. Get the 12 pack
---
I managed to jimmy my way through the scenery by accident recently. Fell through the void under the world.
---
It was a fascinating way to die, to be sure.
---
And then there is me. I've completed the event 4x now to get the same imposters sheepsquatch mask. 
---
I've heard a rumour that there are OTHER prizes to get????
---
yeah my social menu is SCREWED UP
---
OK, whatever you say, weeb who apparently struggles with english reading comprehension, let alone GLORIOUS NIPPON

The diver suit, its like an old timing deep see diving suit

Just have the materials and someone who knows the plan can come make the letters for you.   I did this for someone on xbox

Ammo is not a problem when it takes fusion cells I mean I literally threw almost 2000 rounds away today to free up space since I don’t use them

disease rate is anywhere between 10 and 30 percent per hit. any enemy that hits you more than once in short succession can easily give you diseases
---
Dude, you are wrong. Accept it.

I never could understand why Vaccinated at Rank 3 wasn't 100%. It's pretty major investment (to basically not be annoyed to death) considered the other cards you would be passing up to equip it.
---
bigshotsasse, sorry you do not understand what I am saying.  I am sorry I cannot make it any more simple.
---
What I am suggesting isnt pay to win at all.  Zero pay to win.  You are just too angry at things and you see everything with shades on.  
---
And last I checked, you dont speak for 'everyone' so for you to say no one agrees is laughable at best.
---
You have a larger stash, that does not give you more power.  You only can hold so many items on your person.  And even if I had the small stash and I had it filled with 400lbs of stims, its the same thing.  You are just crying to cry.
---
World full :(. Did you launch yet?
---
Sadly, they want them to feel like work. May just make you and me stop playing, but they are going for people who will just pay to skip the work. Now imagine what happens to stuff in game even if you don’t want atoms when they introduce paying for repair kits. All the sudden finding enough materials to fix your guns and armor and keeping them in working order so you can play gets to be work. Why not just pay for some repair kits to skip the work?
---
It's a power armor guy on top of a pile of bodies. When pressed it surrounds itself with a medium size nuclear explosion and plays a trumpet and drum salute. I got on Xbox for 500 atoms and is limited time until Monday atomic shop reset I believe,maybe Tuesday.
---
I recently brought down my 76th SB (got atom rewards for the accomplishment), and I got maybe 3 or 4 plans from them, so ~5% sounds about right.
---
This, my friend, is why I was reluctant to even bother with it and why I truly regretted it when I did.
---
I've seen a lot of talk about the new camera. Where can I get it?
---
Ughhh I hate how true this is
---
That is dope. I’d love to see more Fallout themed stuff, keep it up man!
---
Maybe you've just been unlucky with the random players who show up? My last time doing the event I was a conduit and only used four or five stimpaks before we won the event. Armor barely took a beating.
---
I'm level 109, with basically average armor. Just random mismatched 1 stars I've earned in the game.
---
While it is true they did make changes over time, that's not relevant to the current OP and the data mining post is unconfirmed. 
---
\&gt;  duped TSE  
---
That wasn't just duped tse. That was (duped) explosive bobblehead stacking with the secondary issue of an bobblehead timer reset exploit. Any Explosives would've worked with those.
---
\&gt; They also played with scaling the SBQ 
---
Show proof.
---
Marine tactical helmet? If that's what your talking about I found the plan on PS4 2 days ago.
---
Again, you are using an exception to try and side-step the facts. You could easily implement a fix like boss strength being based on the total levels of the participating players, keeping the fight universally challenging. But we currently have no such system. You could also easily just not have the event trigger for people under lvl 50, or if you haven't completed the main quest line up to the final fight, but we don't have that either. I don't like the concept of damage scaling (giving a damage boost to lower level players Vs. the boss) as that removes leveling and gear incentive, but it would also work to level the playing field. There are just SO many ways that something could be done to remove the impact of event mooching that it just boggles my mind why it hasn't been implemented. Bethesda may be a BIT new to this, but they have had a good chunk of time with ESO to experiment with online cooperative gameplay, and should know better by now. I appreciate them trying something new with Fallout, and working hard to bring us what they have, and really do enjoy the game. But this system can and should be improved. Making excuses for something that doesn't work well out of sympathy for new players will just hurt the game and make those same players mad when they level up an have to deal with the same shit.
---
3 hour cooldown so no cant use card right after. Apparently the quest can be done pretty quick so the window is small. Ive yet to see it myself.
---
It's life size, not mini like the other one. There are 3 different variants. They are all similar except the patina.
---
I always try to make a point to end up in the infinite void under every Bethesda game at least once. For some reason they seem to always make it a different color game to game.
---
Its actually not that hard to get a server all to yourself at the right playtimes, so its quite possible to do testing.
---
Ahhh, yeah. You're right, that was wrong of me, and now it's etched into the internet for all to see.
---
I suppose I just got swept up in the trash-hype from Bethasda's louder audience...
---
I have been listening to the Hunter/Hunted station for HOURS over multiple days now and the most I've ever gotten was 3/4 people. There's no way in hell I'm going to be able to do it five time.
---
Not out yet
---
There's the whole BoS line of quests that gives you ultracite armor and lets you turn in technical data for rewards at Camp Venture.  
---
There's also the new line of quests and the new raid that gives a lot of cool rewards
---
The fact you know this made my night haha thank u.
---
In the taxidermy place, on the top floor there is a board on a wall with four side quests on it.
---
&gt;Also, how are you poor if you've played since beta?
---
That's a truly ridiculous question.  How many caps he has isn't the point. There is simply no reason to spend them if the event drops garbage, which it most certainly does. 
---
This is not like grinding a missile silo or chasing a cargo bot for a nuke key card.   This costs caps to make happen and  good chunk of them. There's simply no way to justify spending them when  you can spend them on  plans that give you exactly what you expect for the caps spent, as opposed to a 90 percent chance of getting garbage loot.
---
I already know some of the modders who are working on it. We use discord and the nexus website as they work much better than reddit for communication and sharing files.
---
Modding isnt an issue :) I can do that. What does your gauntlet have?
---
Even with 500 if you have nothing else to reduce it from another vector, I doubt that will be enough.   I would be PA is better, because of its hidden resists.
---
They need a 1 minute invincibility. This has happened to me several times. The rule is never leave the game near whitesprings. Cause of this but ive been disconnected or crashed many times at WS. Theres not enough time to throw on power armor/rad suit or get indoors.
---
I did that one, was a lot of fun! Where do I turn in technical data?
---
You can keep server hopping to find a server that is past the three hour cool down. You'll only know once you use your card and it activates. 
---
You have got to make sure people power the pylons. The event gives you about 15 minutes to finish and if you dont keep the pylons powered you cant beat it. 
---
Also do NOT take any junk with you. Let yourself die and respawn. Save stimpacks.
---
Xbox here as well. Love your enthusiasm. GT profshade2
---
Just had this and thought it was my CPU/GPU. This was the only post I could find from Google but good to know it's not my hardware!
---
It looked white to me and I was like, "did they add weather or something without telling anyone?!" I thought it was snowing for a minute haha
---
I did that after a parch last month. The graphics down there aren't any better than the ones on top.
---
And of course it reminded me of doing the same thing in  Skyrim. BGS needs to really STOP recycling it's assets.
---
Thanks will do!
---
Poonanos, lmao!
---
Shoot why not? If enough of us do it maybe they will add it !
---
Countermeasure: Lure the queen away from Dropsite V-9 and FS Delta. Make the fight be in the open fields / fissure far far away from those places. Personally, I prefer fighting near the sundew grove of trees.
---
I truly hope so
---
I actually did it for my first time in about 5 minutes tops. Everyone seemed to know what they were doing and I knew to hop on pylons from all the complaints I've been seeing lol
---
From my understanding it doesn't though if you crippled or stagger them sentinel is no longer active.
---
Chill, it's a game. Some people want to try because at least because they dont have the time to grind hours on end.
---
That's why I never bother to solo a nuke silo. The amount of times the game crashes every session I play has scared me off from doing so. \[XB1 player\]
---
I did know that but i was wondering about the other time.
---
Thank you for the tip! I certainly won't intentionally sign out there any more.
---
I got same thing BUT I can’t buy T-60 LAMP mods because I have ALL AVAILABLE AS MODS (never learned them just part of current bug I guess)  and I am not able to attach them at all.
---
i run a Trouble shooters 3\* one for sheep event
---
its a decent sneak/crit build weapon
---
Beyond aforementioned sulfur fountain at WS Gazebo, there's fast travel (back and forth between camp and V 76 or elsewhere) to speed up disease loss, and  death cures addictions (for some reason respawns gets rid of them)
---
The ammo workshop has a defend quest where you have to find and kill the sheepsquatch. I went to do it, but only super mutants were there.
---
It did, after patch 8 the quest is just gone, no amount of hard resetting, logging out, etc. will bring it back. I’ve even made several Nukashine a and let them naturally ferment over 3 hours because I can’t gain access to the flash fermenter in the quest and nothing
---
Maybe if all my photos hadn't been deleted in an earlier patch... now I just can't be bothered
---
When they land is the time to unload on them. They can go quick. But theres still the warp to an area, youre just frolicking along and than all of sudden theres 2-3 of them right behind you. This has happened to me several times always when im the least prepared and out in the open with nowhere to hide.
---
Sounds like it was made specially for that event lol
---
And soon the Assaultron found Cleo and Pam and realized that and soon the Assaultrons are all "female" and soon they will all be lesbians and soon all the Sentry Bots will die of loneliness. 
---
Soon.
---
Yes the bud color section should be right above yoir pipboy color section in the ini.
---
You turn them in at camp venture. It's in the mire region. When you get there its a building in the center of camp with a lot of shelves inside. There should be a broken white door near the entrance of the secret area. Once you've found it go down the stairs and take two lefts, you should find a red wall safe where you can turn them in. 
---
If you're interested in the exclusive rewards more than the caps and other stuff it's best to turn in only one technical data at a time. When you've completed all the BoS quests all technical data gets stacked as a quest item that you cannot drop. So it's best to turn in as you find them. Try searching places with a lot of filing cabinets
---
Good work!
---
I understand. But an altered system could mitigate the frustration. I made some suggestions how to do it easily in a post below. And those low levels will one day level up and have to deal with the same problem. It will benefit them and the entire player population in the long run to do something about the issue. I am not unreasonable or lacking in compassion for lower level players, in fact I WANT them to keep playing and investing in a game I mostly enjoy so we can all get more out of it. Do you think THEY like losing events? This can be fixed, and should be.
---
I thought I was pretty thorough reading the notes and terminals but I was also left confused. 
---
For most of the quest I thought Cal was working for Byssche Co. but in the secret basement you find a contract signing over the rights to their taxidermy business IIRC. The fact that they all had codenames and Cal was talking to HQ led me to thinking they worked together but why would he give them his family store? 
---
The reason for the fake sheepsquatch is in another note in the secret basement. It's an interview with a famous Cryptid Hunter and it talks about how cryptids possibly have mating rituals. Calvin forms the idea of creating a fake to lure the real one out. Additionally, he tests his imposter on the town of Lewisburg a la blursquatch style - only remote encounters with little evidence. Whether this is to test authenticity or not is anyone's guess. 
---
My biggest question is who is the company he works for? What was his goal as Blacksheep? What did he do wrong to get Wolf on his trail? 
---
It seems like Calvin was killed instantly in his basement, yet we still see the Cat and Mouse spy games throughout the quest between Blacksheep and the Big Bad Wolf. This makes me think Calvin messed up his mission before the sheepsquatch imposter ordeal.
---
Could he have gotten a job with a government agency and kept his sheepsquatch idea secret just to gain access to secret tech? Again, why does he sign away his business to do this?
---
Wolf puzzles me a lot too. Killing cops and living in abandoned sandwich shops, just cuz? Seems like if you wanted to blend in, you wouldnt dress conspicuously. Idk man.
---
Honestly I was really disappointed with the whole thing. The writing, the acting, the questing, and most of all the end boss. 
---
Bethesda said this game would be playable solo and this imposter sheepsquatch is absolutely not possible alone.
---
Thing is, they seem to hate landing. I've seen them do it, but usually they just stay airborne.
---
But, yeah, many times I've logged in or fast traveled and been taking sonic blasts before I was even all the way loaded in.
---
Found 4-5 near the deathclaw cave in the savage divide once
---
(Apologies on the delay responding)
---
Yes, the issue with the Lever Action occurs in PA as well.
---
What I just noticed though, is a further issue...
---
Since the game has you locked into aiming, it also prevents you from accessing your Pip-Boy! (Can still access the map, though)
---
This, too, occurs both in and out of PA.
---
While their stance is understandable, on the terms of stickied threads being made by someone who eventually ceases to participate in the community... And the fact that the moderators themselves aren't willing to make their own which is kept update... Honestly this highlights why a very active player and community participant is needed in /r/FO76

Marine Combat Helmet
---
I use Pain Train sometimes, but it's mostly just for the hell of it. I'm almost positive that it isn't affected by any other perks at all. It does a specific amount of unlisted damage and that's it. It really just seems to depend on the enemy level/health unfortunately. If they are low level they die almost immediately, higher in the 10-30 range it hurts them a fair bit. Anything over that and it really just tickles them even if they're thrown. Obviously if the enemy is high level with low health (ghouls) it will seem more effective, but it's not really. You won't be one hit running them over either. I've never seen anyone else use it, so maybe I'm wrong on some points. Don't take it negatively though. It's definitely a viable way to stagger/knockdown a group of enemies and then finish them off. Hope this info helps.
---
They need to fix shit all across the board. I like this event more than "Scorched Earth" because the health isn't affected by the non-contributers that hide somewhere. Atleast with this I have a chance of selling my crappy  2 star raiders left arm for 12 caps than nothing. yeah I'm using way more stims, but I'm also using less rad aways, plus I'm getting something which is better than nothing.
---
Zeniaji and Takahashi, do some work! lol
---
Didn't do anything when I changed the values. Must have a second go at it. Have you done it or seen anyone else with it?
---
It’s from the New Vegas meme. I’m about to jingle jangle your shit up. I just shortened it a titch. It’s a great weapon and it does a cute jingley sound as I beat enemies to death with it.
---
* sneaks in as stealth sniper taking minimum damage and dishing out plenty of VATs headshots *
---
It’s a good idea to slip into your Power Armor just before the server crashes just in case it spawns you into a bad place.   (Or they could fix the bugs.)
---
You should add me on discord if you have it. I have a map that has the same gridlines using the normal map and will help you get closer to making a more accurate map.
---
Yes! I wanna be able to wear the mask again haha
---
I’ve had this happen before too. My tip is keep your hazmat suit on your favorites wheel for just such an occasion. It’s also helpful for if you die while fighting the queen and end up respawning in the nuke zone unexpectedly.
---
I always finish the mission I am on and then return to my CAMP before signing out, always seems to be the safest option... unless your CAMP is in whitesprings of course!
---
This also happens on PS4, when you repair something the box on left side showing stats, repair condition, damage, etc. becomes blank. This is bad because then you can't tell what needs to be repaired without trying to repair everything or exiting and reentering the crafting station.
---
I can craft a new mod, but not attach one I bought.  I am on Xbox 1
---
I'm too low level for power armour. And I don't know if the just the chassis offers any protection.
---
I did mine all by myself I activated the computer and everyone flocked to me
---
There's actually a farm in the forest, not that far from vault 76, that grows cranberries, &gt;!Aaronholt Homestead near the NW corner of the map!&lt;...Not to mention a few other spots you can find cranberries in the forest zone.  So I don't think they're keeping cranberries from players to prevent low level characters from having access to them.
---
The same goes for many other plants that only commonly grow in high level zones, you can often find at least a few of them even in the forest if you know where to look.
---
Being able to grow other crops would certainly be welcome though.
---
Isn't the point to have fun with a new and different quest?  I don't know about you, but if I'm concerned about spending too much, it's real currency, not bottle caps.
---
 The fact that sheepsquish costs a lot isn't too problematic for the late-game players BGS is targeting with it. It keeps the quest out of reach of newer players until they are ready, prolonging the gaming experience. BGS did this intentionally to soak up caps out of the in game economy and provide a newer extended value to the game
---
I do the prototype hazmat suit and occasionally radx and literally take 0 rads idk if it is a bug of my resistance just gets so high
---
Did you try any of the perks, mutations or mods I questioned to see if they boost the damage?
---
Pm me I got some ideas I’d like to discuss if you don’t mind
---
Nice. I've only ever seen 1 star legendary tesla rifle. Mine is just a double. I had a Junkie tesla rifle once that did over 300 damage per shot when I was all fucked up on chems, but of course I died and was magically addiction free. I just didn't see it as very viable after that since I don't really use chems very often anyway, so I got rid of it.
---
Same on xbox. Bethesda did what they do best, fix a couple things and break a shit load of other things.
---
Oh I see what you mean
---
It'd be helpful if you stated what platform you're playing on.
---
I know it'd just be asking for issues, but I'd also love a camp 'gallery' frame to show your pictures in your camp.
---
I saw that tonight, too. It didn't show the correct location until I spent 35 caps fast traveling up there...
---
Lmao ouchy. Im ps4
---
Vendor caps are for each person.  Another person selling to a vendor does NOT change the amount of caps available for you to sell.
---
Best bet outside of random luck or the trade forum would be to simply ask the other people there if they have what you need and will trade or sell. Have had good luck with this, and if you don't have a mic, no worries, plenty of people run around after the event trading and gathering loot. Just offer trade and hope for the best, at the worst it's more chances of finding what you want.
---
Yeah, the sims 2, that was a local game played on your local machine? You want custom textures? No problem. 76, on the other hand, your pictures are stored client side. If you use them as decorations, only you would see them, just like if you use a mod that has custom textures in an online game; it only affects *your* client.
---
+20% damage to crabby elitist players.
---
This picture was taken at the Watoga's "Thunder mountain substation TM-02"
---
Not the atom shop ones, it's an important distinction that you can't seem to grasp. Please educated yourself
---
Do you have any bloodied explosive guns or good 3* unyielding armor pieces?
---
and the aqua boy/girl doesn't prevent diseases either :|
---
What time?
---
Yup.
---
It gives more of a shotgun effect
---
Not a bad idea...but Im the type that likes to "have" things
---
Yeah, sooo I was curious about that. From the ending of that recording, the blood on the ground, and the assultron baahhing at the end does that mean the assultron "mated" Calvin to death?
---
Anytime from like 3-9 sunday. Of from like 12-6 saterday.
---
I can craft them for you for 500 caps and mats to make them
---
Maybe you can use it as an on the fly sneak boost. Instead of swapping perks in a hairy situation, bring out the fixer and try to sneak by.
---
&gt;But leather would be impenetrable
---
Why exactly? We're talking about beams that melt steel here...
---
Or how about a photo album that other players can look at. Make it an item you can find plans for, then it builds a book on a pedestal that you can place and other players can open and view.
---
This killed me, thanks for the laugh riot!
---
With high amounts of luck, it may be fixed by Tuesday.
---
Please don't create suggestion posts if they contain topics which have been retired to Bethesda Plz: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/bethesdaplz
---
thats what she said
---
Ill hit you tomorrow
---
Good build but if you wanted to be better in boss fights boss fights like sbq I might switch luck of the draw for tenderizer in charisma if you are into that
---
I can see this being tricky to implement. First off everyone would need to download your photo so they could see it on the wall. That's probably not the main issue. The main issue is likely with how easy it is to put any image on your computer in your photo gallery and I'm sure you can figure that's a whole can O worms.
---
&gt;hopefully bethesda can fix that legendary tag for procs
---
Much like the Enclave mission, it's probably design.  1-3* only, not no-stars.  So not really something to fix.
---
Because there is no good way to do it in an online shared world game? Or is "Bethesda doesn't know how" the reason this isn't a feature in any other online shared world/MMOs out there?
---
This would be great!
---
If you have enough mats you can just make caps cap in an hour.
---
Make a new character on an alt account. FT to your main, get stuff sell it. Repeat. Infinite repeatability so long as you have stuff to sell.
---
YOOOO how did you get the marine armor helm! This will be a fine addition to my collection.....
---
But the Burrows don't come out until Tuesday.
---
He mightve done this to me he dipped out pretty quick and left server
---
While they are at it...give us junk piles for CAMP decorating...so you can cover the floor and leave little paths to crafting stations, etc.
---
I don't know about other platforms, but I found a workaround for PS4, after you hit triangle the interface/menu thing will vanish. Hit square at that point and you will be given t he option to repair. Hit X as normal. On other platforms, try different buttons when the interface vanishes
---
I posted a separate thread with video but here  is a repost of that video:
---
https://youtu.be/ZQtA32k-Aak
---
Mine would just show death and destruction at the hand of nuclear weapons
---
I've been doing for half and hour now at around 20 servers hops, and still no legendary either. I don't think it's that common at all.
---
A 1x1 foundation that you can plop down at a moments notice. See some people, plop down your camp.
---
Anti-armor would still apply, but it only affects damage resistance and not damage reduction. So the usual +29% of not much.
---
You mean like there was in the past three Fallout games?
---
Sure, that'll be 500 Atoms!
---
What's the limit btw? I tend to move older screens to archives so I see the most recent ones and some of the best older ones only. Thus I never got over said limit throughout my 500hrs of gameplay.
---
Oh, you know what I mean man lol
---
I feel like the big difference between the two is that when armor is broken, it’s probably completely torn up and useless; when a weapon is broken, it might be nothing more than a broken trigger on a rifle, cracked handle on a super sledge, or an out of time cylinder on a revolver. 
---
That being said, I do think repair costs should scale based on condition. But as far as weapons weighing less, having experienced my fair share of it in the real world, I’d have to agree with how they have it now.
---
Where are they anyways, I never see them comment on anything lol
---
Considering it was in the last three Fallout games? No, it's not difficult to do, but then again it's the same deal with naming weapons and look at how that went.
---
Also you risk disconnecting/crashing and losing it if you drop it instead of placing it.
---
Surprises me how many people use the drop instead of place for the power armor.
---
Fight Night 1 is about to go live! Message me now if you would like to compete or spectate!
---
RIP me, North of the clubhouse haha
---
thanks man
---
I have literally no idea what happened in any of it.
---
I went to a camp site and then some other camp sites. Then some more. And listened to things. I finished it all but cannot tell you a single thing that occurred other than tediously looking for clues.
---
I'm waiting for an Oxhorn video on it.
---
I'll give u 1 cap each :)
---
No but seriously, nice! That's a hella quest reward.
---
They don't want you to do the dailies. They want you to buy their dumb fucking monopoly money.
---
I dont understand how this is still an issue, this is a top 3 thing needed to fix the economy prior to player vending, if you cant view all the effects its a no for me.
---
It got spread from the Dev room on the PC.  And I believe like the other ones you can learn the plan by scrapping them, so it kept spreading.
---
Absolutely!
---
I’m lucky if I’m able to do 3 dailies. Same for weeklies for that matter.
---
Didn't work. PvP just sucks.
---
You have a point, I can't exactly argue with it when you put it like that. And I mean not all objects lose a significant amount of weight when it's missing [x] part but I do feel like most weapons in game would most likely be totaled at some point of their usage. Having a huge ass Gatling gun weigh 20+ pounds while broken when I'm sure that thing has been through hell and back just weighs you down, ya feel? Something like a gatling is archaic at best and probably not the most easily maintained weapon so it'd most likely be missing major components and barrels after enough damage.
---
My theory is the real one will be in the Burrows
---
So will you get banned though? Or because how it’s the plan everything should be good. I heard your able to get it though legit. Rumor has it that if you scrap a bunch of sentry bot helms you will eventually get it.
---
You'll come to your senses.
---
Wait, I thought there was a post just today that claimed the SBQ doesn’t actually scale with the number of participants. Maybe the extra people get in the way, that I can see, but one good leader on area chat could definitely help with that. The few times I had that happen everything went swimmingly. Of course, gotta actually have a good leader lol
---
Am I the only one who already dreads these challenges?.. 
---
"Take a photo of your drunk friend in a sheepsquatch imposter outfit while naked, intoxicated and standing over a fissure site with two dead scorchbeasts in the background while being level 10 or lower" (0/5)
---
And all that for magnificent 10 atoms ofc.
---
Stop. You look like an ass.
---
you missed the retro-futurism part
---
Not speaking for anyone else but it might be the adds, I've done the event about 7 times now and 4 of them I had to be conduit supreme ^(I ^was ^all ^three ^pylon ^conduits). 
---
And on top of the impastasquatch seemingly targeting me over the others, ^I ^wasn't ^attacking ^it ^i ^was ^avoiding ^fighting ^to ^stay ^alive the many other people weren't taking care of the adds so I had a large portion of the gutsys attacking me.
---
Sometimes there seem to be a relatively small amount of adds other times it feels like they never stop spawning.
---
It really does depend, a few of the events I did as conduit supreme I only needed like 20 stims, others I needed 60+, the first one I did I panic buttoned through 100 because I didn't know what to do or why my health was draining, the event said we needed conduits, so I jumped on it.
---
The few I did today have gone much much better barely needing 10+ if I'm 3-time conduit champ and less if I was only holding one pylon.
---
The more people become informed on what to do the better it will be on everyone.
---
Not the one to speed the fermentation process.
---
&gt; Rumor has it that if you scrap a bunch of sentry bot helms you will eventually get it.
---
That's not true.
---
&gt;So will you get banned though? Or because how it’s the plan everything should be good.
---
So far I don't believe anyone has been banned specifically for having it.  And they have not removed it from players who have it or the plans.  And I'm not 100% but it seems mostly PC users who have it.  Or overwhelmingly PC users.  Due to the spread of Dev room items on that platform.
---
No.  Fermenter can only be used by you at your own camp.  Cannot be used at other's camps or workshops.
---
Daaaaaaaammmnn. That would be my dream weapon. Especially if it had 40% faster fire rate on top of that...
---
What do you spend the 2000 caps and flux on? I got to the encounter the sheepsquatch part of the quest but it was in cool down mode.

I've been wondering why people were nuking up there! Thought maybe there was a lot of flora or something.
---
I traded for it a while back. I've scrapped it, learned the plan for it, and have made more without being banned. I'm pretty sure Bethesda has officially said that it is an allowed item. If you're interested in purchasing one, feel free to add me, IGN WanderingWolf15. I'll be on for the next couple of hours.
---
Yeah. I think I might one guy in console though who had it but he just vanished after a minute I saw him lol.
---
Do shotgunner perks boost the damage?
---
From what I hear you get that message if the event is on cool down, might have to served hop.
---
Ok.   Thanks
---
they're too busy banning people for making jokes/"shitposts" in their discord
---
There's a lot of flora for sure and super mutants but that's about it. Not sure why you can't nuke that area??? I know plenty of spots are off limits.
---
It's pretty obvious why they set the limit so low for consoles, but for PC it could go way bigger
---
If you ever see something like, "Sons of Dane radio signal found" pop up on your screen, it means the event has just started.
---
The recall cars costs literally 2500 caps and flux to create
---
Proof?
---
Well I only have the Xbox version of the game.
---
Yup same over an hour only to get stuck in a death screen that forced me to close app. Dumpster fire of a game I was away for a few month to give them time to get it stable. I don't tho k I'll be back a 3rd
---
I only stick when I’m not facing the boss and conduit’ing. 
---
My entire strategy for that fight is to go after the boss with my deathclaw gauntlet and die a lot. 
---
You are right though, the cost of entry is pretty steep.
---
Let me see if I can record last 5 mins. On XBO.
---
It's gardening, it's not like it'd be non-canon to be able to plant beans lol.
---
Wish I was a mod, because I don't care about discord one bit. I don't always browse Reddit but I browse this subreddit everyday. 
---
Also, jokes and shit posts are funny, they need to get over it. lol
---
I wonder if that would mean if you were on the edge of regions you could grow everything in those regions. It'd be neat, for sure.
---
I would assume anything ranging from normal clothes to military uniforms/surplus/whatever they need to wear given the situation.
---
I tried it three times tonight. Two successful attempts with 2-3 other players, and once solo which was another fail. I had 40 bioluminescent fluids when time ran out. I only had Fireflies and no Rad Toads. It is like you noted, and the respawn rate was pitiful. I was waiting 10-15 seconds for respawns which adds up fast in 8 minutes.
---
happened to me two times aswell but still went back at it. everyone gets bitten by a bug or two once in a while.
---
It's a classic love story... Delusional boy teaches a robot to dress like a sheep. Robot fucks boy to death. It's timeless, really.
---
It is a particularly hard one, which is why I tried to provide an alternative solution that worked for me. Sorry it didn't pan out for you. :(
---
Thats brave of you. What system?
---
It's just because they're anti-federalists/secessionists. "Free" States, being free from the tyranny of the federal government.
---
Yeah. If they bring back level up once for 10 atoms I'll look the other way of they were to skip the kill a brood mother for 20.
---
Unfortunately I set the DVR to 30 seconds, so no proof. Hopefully this won't become widespread, but it did happen. The enemies seemed to be at least 25% legendary too,but they were all 1 star. Quit the server when the guys started flying and killing everyone.
---
Very awesome. I would definitely hang this up as a poster or somethin.
---
Sorry I didn't say, Xbox
---
You know how in big companies/corporations, every tiny thing is configured for maximum efficiency, no matter the feelings of anyone, or anything like that, for some reason they believe that's necessary in a discord. Everything has a specific channel for it, I mean EVERYTHING, and if you even mention something outside it's channel, get fucked, can't mention Fallout in the Off topic channel, in a fallout discord.
---
True enough but it's been a epidemic to me I've lost 2 jet pack mods dozens of others along with sever stability it's more of a head ach then enjoyment at this point I miss my old fallout
---
Because it cuts down on low effort posts.
---
You can upload a picture to imgur without creating an account, and there's probably a way to do it through Reddit as well since the funtionality is there in the mobile app I use.
---
How much stuff do you need moved?
---
Ok good

I've been looking for a very, very long time as well. Did you ever find anyone?

Ps4 here. Good luck.
---
well the old fallout games are still there. many fo76 players have taken a break gone back to one of the previous games for a while and then returned.
---
How much perk points do you have in endurance? If you only have like 3 you will get lots more diseases
---
I just hit level 13 and I think my husband is in the 150's now. I'm almost ready to start wearing power armor and use the ghoulslayers bat he got for me!
---
I think the series has always been a little silly. I don’t mind it actually, I like it how a post-apocalyptic type game can actually make you smile and chuckle a little. And making fallout 76 completely serious would just be a bore, with no nps as a backbone. I can’t imagine reading terminals or listening to holotapes without the little jokes that make hem unique!
---
for those of us that make videos, like in other games, such as WoWS, you can remove HUD from screen.  very helpful when doing vids.
---
I'll offer 5k caps for the imposter sheepsquatch outfit. IGN: jchamlin
---
Take her out on a date?
---
Or "take her out" as in killing her?  Because I, personally, would love that option.
---
You on Xbox?
---
Whats it called??
---
I'm just sad that there isn't a rainbow hair color. maybe they should add the warhawk AND the rainbow hair color.
---
As a heavy gunner, I feel your pain on carrying broken weapons lol. I constantly have to repair my .50 and my Gatling. Surprisingly, though, with some very basic tool making skills, you could easily maintain a Gatling, and a .50 for that matter. Barrels would be the hardest to make, as you mentioned, but if taken care of, there’s no reason you shouldn’t get 10’s of thousands of rounds through them before you have a problem. 
---
The Minigun is a whole nother monster. To work on those, you need specialty armorer training, and you have to be an electrician to boot! 
---
But I understand where you’re coming from 100%. I might be injecting too much of my real world knowledge into this game. I might take firearms too seriously sometimes lol
---
I ment more of the style single player Npc story driven but thx for the input
---
I would say it should work like that for the daily/weekly quests, as it’s a little unfair that newer players would be able to get double the atoms older players got through the challenges
---
Oh, my bad man. When you said it would be a good addition to your collection, I assumed you were on PC.
---
I’ll help you out if you’re still on in an hour
---
Yes sir 
---
Gt communistraptor, before you agree check all my transactions under my profile and then decide if you want my help, just a tip for any and all future dealings when buying and sell or transferring goods
---
Oh yeah I've been on discord before I just find all the multiple channels tedious and it splits up people too much. 
---
There's also that annoying @everyone that people seem to overuse. 
---
I think Reddit is a much nicer and cleaner way to talk. (In that I mean better organized for me) but that's just personal preference I guess.
---
At least the new boss can't fly off the map like the scorchbeast queen still does.
---
37 what? Nukes launched last month? 
---
Clueless I'm not. I'm also not the one that got killed because I couldn't stand up for myself. You were either in survival and to weak to play (lol) or were in adventure and engaged in combat with someone WAY out of your league. Probably better read up on that either way.
---
Kill her Anakin
---
I know the other posters said it but to reiterate *don't* drop your power armor unless you want to get rid of it. Place it with X or someone could get in it. That or the server goes down at the wrong time and it's gone forever. Why it's telling you it would be destroyed is because it's got an atom shop skin, anything with one can't be dropped as someone without the item could just pick it up for free.
---
OP drinkin' Nukashine IRL
---
I'll have to keep an eye out for that; I [love](https://i.imgur.com/KQiSp6D.png) [taking](https://imgur.com/ECGXvHf) [photos](https://imgur.com/1NY6SzI) [in the](https://imgur.com/YXExRMN) [game](https://imgur.com/uUtWSRz)!
---
For what gun?
---
I finally started it and just as the action started.... Boom, server disconnected. I still don't understand why they haven't fixed that yet
---
I'm not sure it'll take that disclaimer.
---
When it comes out, What lvl do you think is recommended for this im mid lvl
---
Oh wow really well on mine both of them are blank no stats and no material
---
Hey, real world knowledge isn't bad! The game is sorta just aaaaaaaa I need to save weight if it's gonna be useless. I tend to keep 'irreparable' in stash so I'd hate to clog it up with full weight capacity. Not to say they aren't repairable, just, kinda useless for me atm so I just let them sit until I truly need them.
---
No. You can't even access another person's fermenter.
---
TWO......................THOUSAND...........................CAPS???????????????????????????
---
i agree.  for that much, 3\* should be a gimmee.
---
No
---
According to the inside the vault +50 and for more than 2 people
---
Its 2500 if you dont have hard bargain
---
I think it should go one further, and be a faction DLC like with Biv where you can unlock them by doing missions for the corresponding bots. But sprinkle some of the faction content throughout the appropriate areas so you’re not stuck repeatedly doing just those missions for the loot.
---
Well i did its on my mule character did it by farming tech plans on my lvl 177 main
---
You can't put Atom Shop paints on a PA piece and then give it to another player with the paint still intact.
---
Fair enough, however I’m not risking my standing as a trustworthy trader over some gear but it’s all your call
---
You might be my guy, I don't know who to trust.
---
As far as I know, they can't. Atom shop skin can only be used by the people that bought it
---
New to the game, why is this good?
---
So, basically a dragon 😉
---
It's a peaceful spot. There's an acid deposit just north of there if you want to place a camp. Also a raider camp to the northeast that occasionally spawns power armor for easy power cores.
---
Well shit, me and my freind are lvl 49 combined
---
It depends on what your looking for i guess. I always have some things to trade and things to sell. To me, a bucket of stable flux is just as good as a bucket of caps. Same as fusion cores, ammo... I also don't believe anyone should be paying 25k caps for anything.
---
If you want the paint job and are on xb1 ill paint your t60
---
This is a masterpiece. Would be a awesome boss battle in the future. *hint hint* Bethesda 👍🏼
---
I kinda like the possibility of getting drills as legendaries, but I see where you're coming from. Maybe they could have something that makes it so legendaries that spawn from events don't give you that stuff as opposed to removing it altogether. There also appears to be a delay between when the events can start that I wish was absent, so I would potentially not have to server hop as much.
---
It started on 16th of April. You guys have enough to time to level up and gear up:)
---
If you mean the Atom shop Excavator skins, no, you can't get someone to put that on for you. Atom shop items can't be dropped or traded to prevent people from getting stuff for free.
---
this would be so cool
---
You on now? GT pwnguin
---
Ok, thank you for letting me know... any tips for getting that many ATOMS in a short period of time?
---
Got a set today wanna buy?
---
That's not a bad idea; maybe the weight reduction can be level based? So a low level has more reduction, therefore more room to carry junk since they may not have immediate access to a workbench or enough supplies to quickly repair a broken item. For higher levels you probably have everything you need at your CAMP so it's just a matter of fast traveling or spawning your CAMP if you want to take the easy route.
---
True im gonna start xp grinding with pal

Message me on xb1

I’m at the store, should be home in 30
---
What end game loot? Like this one I just got from  defeating the sheepsquatch? (Spoiler)
---
https://i.imgur.com/KfueGrz.jpg
---
Buy them or get a pot of coffee and start grinding out challenges. Only ways I know.
---
When this game first launched I expected us to be able to erect or own radio station and have our own playlist of songs and even broadcast our voices like an announcer. I guess I had a little too much faith
---
Also, how is it even possible to get infected by a molerat while wearing power armor? There is no way its teeth are getting through that armor unless it scored a lucky hit into the back of the knee.
---
Then there is the fact that diseases that affect one species are not necessarily transferrable to another, but I won't pull at that thread.
---
Ever thought of running a blooded 2H, with emergency protocols on a power armor? You'll not need to repair your weapon and it's very cheap too. Also you can face tank the queen for days. Only the poison from bloodbugs/mirelurks kill you.
---
I did this on accident....my precious plastic😞 
---
Thanks for the psa though.
---
Works for me
---
I gotcha. Hopefully soon BGS will give us more stash space, or separate containers where we can put stuff and lock up. 
---
My biggest problem with weapon weights comes from the rifles. 14 pounds for a handmade?? I have an AK in my closet that weighs 8 pounds loaded with a red dot on it! They really need to bring someone in with some experience to set them straight with this stuff.
---
If you do the Sbeepsquatch event, it has a chance to drop plans for the Fixer, which means you can craft it at max level :D
---
Except that there are a ridiculous number of changes that simply don't get put in. Not 1, not 2, not 3, an absurd number of changes simply don't get put in the patch notes.
---
I have a tse shotgun that i use quite often. I never had it prior to the nerf so i didnt feel the sting. It is however VERY useful when we solo launch nukes. Mainframe core murdering and robots hate it. Turets die from splash damage. Its lovely.
---
I also have a tse minigun that I'm soooo close to selling but i may wait til the legendary vendor to see what i can do with it... it just eats ammo by the thousands and is less than spectacular at its job.
---
Black humor has always been a part of the series. It can't be deadly serious all of the time. The new radio plays were one of my favorite parts of this, they sound a lot like the real thing, really well produced, but almost all end on a bitter, biting note. Instead of Timmy getting someone out of the well, the well fucking eats Timmy. They felt like classic Fallout to me.
---
Zzzzzz
---
I was cheering you on like I was watching a sporting event or something, lol. Is it me or is the boss larger than a typical assaultron?
---
Since it's an extension of your stash are you able to have more than one at a time?
---
Tagging this.
---
I'm always on the brink of filling my stash but I'm somehow always lowering it, probably because I sell most of my junk off nowadays and don't actively legendary hunt.
---
But yeah I'm just lucky for my weightless handmade, thing weighs like 10.8 with all the mods on it, probably like 21 without weightless.
---
Bone Raider is JUST for excavator armor. There is a bug in the store when you buy one paint you unlock the woodland warrior Camo one or something for an arm so that’s probably what you’re seeing. I have the blackbird armor from the store and I hand a woodland warrior or whatever arm unlocked.
---
There is a master repair kit thread if you want to complain more. You clearly just want to fight about it. Bethesda clearly stated their would be two different ones. People choose to ignore that.
---
I can one shot all levels of ghouls with it and most super mutants. Occasionally I'll have to double tap. But I'm using sneak crits as well. Mine is only a level 30 something too. Got it during a quest and just testing it out. But yeah, it's a lot weaker than my bloody combat rifle and still gets the job done.
---
Makes me drink more IRL
---
Same on PC.
---
I have a class freak 3, 2, and four 1s, and I still have perks I haven't gotten yet.
---
I heard someone mention taking the fireproof perk and I gotta say, it works like a charm.
---
I only have 2* fireproof but even without power armor or any other legendaries boosting my defense, it lets me shrug off the sonic scream 
---
Don't know what to do about the green farts, i just eat the scorched i kill to gain back some health.
---
Who knew, I never even had to go whale watching to find one in the wild
---
ok thank you
---
Maybe so, but tbh I feel like it should just be base all around, or well equal. If it's equal maybe like a quarter of the way lighter?
---
I feel like making things much lighter for new players is sorta unrealistic but in a sense the weaker, less experienced dwellers may have damaged the weapon more simply because they don't know how to handle it like veterans. So maybe there is an explanation on why it would be lighter for them.
---
Doesn't seem to be working for me. Maybe I'm doing something wrong?
---
There was. I read it. Obviously OP did not.
---
Looks like the dirt in Toxic Valley.
---
&gt;The fact that sheepsquish costs a lot isn't too problematic for the late-game players BGS is targeting with it. 
---
Except for the fact that it doesn't drop late game loot that's worth having.   Cost benefit analysis says you got shafted if you actually spent caps to make this quest happen. 
---
Best just to wait for a notification that the quest is happening. But even then I doubt that I'd bother after having completed it once and gotten a fedora.
---
You think there wouldn't be anybody wearing wacky outfits in post-apocalyptic times?
---
Someone that just had money wouldn’t need power patcher 3 and could equip stronger perks than you
---
You should post this on the market76 Reddit page, there’s a karma system there that will tell you who’s had successful trades. Someone with over 50 karma is pretty trustworthy and there are people with 150+ who help me with this all the time. Beats just doubting anyone who offers to help..
---
Any big dupers that got banned and cared have probably already purchased new accounts and will simply exploit again if something comes up.
---
Maybe, I just feel like at this point since there are so many players that are really high-level, it could be hard for new players to feel like they have a chance. I definitely find it intimidating as I'm a pretty casual player (I love the game but it raises my anxiety so I can't play it too often).
---
Maybe I’m an idiot... what is Biv??
---
Idk man, I'm not trying to fight a bunch of enemies undeground just to get a trouble shooter's pipe wrench. But it does look a bit cool, hopefully it gives better loot than this Sheepsquatch Imposter.
---
I also added a hyphen so theyre sorted first :)
---
I understand, tbh the game really likes to bother me sometimes. i'm sorta casual sorta serious, try to be casual since the game seems to dislike giving me amazing weapons but favors everyone else lol
---
If I could do it all over again I wouldn't do any quests (events yes, quests no) until I hit level 50... Just in case I run across any leveled item rewards... the next time I start up a character I'm going to stay in the woods killing boars...
---
I dealt huge amount of damage and got a drill. The sheepsquatch is the Insult Boss. 
---
Same here... Screw it. I don't care about outfits anyway.
---
Really? I can make like 60+ disease cures in 30 min.
---
I use antibiotics even because I'm a connoisseur
---
Agreed have been booted with the classic "server not responding" once about 10mins into a nuke we launched.
---
I get it, I'm fond of the fallout 3 aesthetic personally. But regardless Fallout 76 has a personality of it's own, creating it's own identity over time
---
Ghouls startle the fuck out of me and they get me constantly. I know there's evidence out there that there was a perk modified involving having a dog as a companion, and I really hope that gets implemented. I feel like having a companion in Fallout 4 made it easier for me to play because they were able to alert me to danger that I otherwise might have missed. It didn't always work but they still made me feel safer. Hence my name lol
---
Now if someone can modify Fallout 4 to be a multiplayer game, it will be perfect…
---
He means the in game camera that Is coming soon not IRL photo. I mean you can take lewd photo in game but ..... If there is going to be any controvesry about that it will be more of a meme
---
Agreed. Getting a decent 3* legendary items is ridiculously rare. Hopefully, Betheda would make 3* legendary enemies always drop 3* items. That would make a great difference, I think.
---
Thats where I found mine. Sadly had to scrap the components on it to fast travel :(
---
SurvivAl?
---
Yeah, the cost is waaaaay too high. Server hopping is the way too go. Or I'd lower it to 800caps.
---
Ok, well if you max/min your character to have that low a stat in anything there should be consequences.
---
Sure man, sounds good! I'll add you, and I'll be on for about the next hour and a half. IGN WanderingWolf15
---
Indeed. The final straw for me was the third straight dc on the Sheepsquatch fight. I’m just done with the game for the time being. I’ll check back in a few weeks to see if this AAA game dev has figured out how to get their game to run smoothly and consistently.
---
The voices will still be there though right? I cannot get enough of that soothing voice.
---
FYI, I'm à bit drunk and will be in need of some help with what I'm shifting.
---
You need to highlight it and it will expand, it is the same for everyone.
---
It really would, but my frustration comes from the SBQ and Sheepsquatch Imposter, they require too much just to get bad items.
---
Max strength at 15. I haven't gotten any reduction on strength from my PA. I also have the welded rebar on my PA set which gives me more melee damage.. I forgot about that.
---
DO NOT spend the caps to make this quest happen. Hell no. Just play the game and if the event is happening you get a notice.  
---
That's what I did and, truth be told, I almost didn't even bother checking it out because this kind of crap is what I expected. 
---
But I did the event despite myself but it left me wishing that I had not bothered.   And it was not failure, but ***successful completion*** of the event that left me feeling frustrated and wishing I hadn't bothered.  The robot and the queen are in a competition as to who can drop the worst loot.
---
I need time to think..but..I may have some recommendarions
---
Is there an echo in here?
---
I've gained at least 40 or so levels on my lvl 125 guy just trying to get a decent legendary in adventure. Cycling between 6 or so different locations like WesTech and Watoga. Quickly killing all those high level enemies (especially super mutants) racks up the XP pretty quick. 
---
I'm more so surprised people actually keep up the grind to the point they reach lvl 200-300.
---
Just server hop and save yourself the caps, I’d say about 3 out of 5 jumps the event spawns for me about an hour or less and plus with the new caps pool it’s not to hard to make your caps back.  Hell I still have my card from the quest and I’ve done the quest at least 10 times
---
I'm afk for10 min
---
I bought a keycard once and just started server hopping afterwards, no way am I spending more caps for this event until it's fixed.
---
That hasnt been my experience at all
---
If you accidentally picked up a stack of items that were commonly duped, you got hit.
---
What do you play on? I never seem to have this many issues.
---
Right!  The 3d artist who worked on the redesign of Deathclaws in Fallout 4, Jonah Lobe, actually called them "Dragons of the Waste".
---
The series has always had humor and a bit of wackiness. I personally like where this iteration is going. I’m hoping for more weapon skins and PA skins that are a little crazy.
---
I thought that Bysshe was some sort of government undercover group, and they hired Calvin because he was a cyrptid hunter. We know that the Grafton Monster was created the same way Super Mutants were. So for me, most of the "crytids" probably were government experiments. And so these undercover government people are trying to tidy up their messes, hiring people they think can hunt them. And as usual, they fuck things up even worse. 
---
When he goes MIA, it's because he's been killed by the assultron Sheepsquatch and isn't checking in, so they go looking for him and he's a chunk of bloody goo in the secret basement. His sister can't find him and thinks he's gone Sheepsquatch hunting, but really he's dead in the basement. 
---
I wonder where Wolf is now, though. Clearly he didn't take care of the assultron Sheepsquatch, and I didn't find any bodies laying around that I recall.
---
Lol chill bro it’s just a game. Some people want to give new events a try that everybody is talking about and that the game heavily promotes. If you want this game to survive, you can’t exclude people just because they don’t fit into your schedule of play.
---
I can't wait to put on that diving suit! please please be a cosmetic outfit and not something like the hazmat suit!
---
Thanks for the heads up.  Haven’t bothered to go that particular one yet and it sounds I ain’t missing much.
---
Totally!
---
No, pacifist mode was turned on for me. It was a nice feature :O(
---
I didn't do it. As a hardcore FO fan i dont need the multiplayer aspect to have fun in this expansive game. I will say that there are some spectacular people playing the title compared to other games.
---
I was incorrect and can admit it. Flux goes to your aid, i was panicked! I can replace the junk, flux not so easy to farm when you're a solo traveler who doesn't want to server hop.
---
Thanks for listening to my rant regardless. This iteration of FO can be frustrating in so many ways.
---
what r u on ps4 or xbox if ps4 i can get one going when i get home from work.
---
He's part of the new brewing quests that just came out awhile ago. It's how you unlock camp brewing and he gives out daily quests that reward brewing recipes/other stuff
---
I'm guess the diving suit prevents you to get sick staying inside the water. So, it would be like hazmat suit? Nah, I too wish it'll be a cosmetic item:)
---
I didn't even bother to server hop to make it open up, because I seriously don't give a shit about it enough.  I was just playing the game as normal and the notice came up, but even then I was torn about whether or not I wanted to even bother.
---
I use an automatic Tesla rifle on occasion, non legendary, level 50, automatic with a reflex site. for mobs of melee enemy it is a freaking lawnmower. The way the shots arc for baddie to baddie, and blasting off 15 of of them in short order will reduce all but the hardiest creatures of the wasteland to a fine powdery dust.
---
It's also handy for group quests, I routinely fire into a melee friend's back and let the shots arc off him to the enemies.
---
My only gripe is ammo capacity. 15 is a pretty shallow well for a heavy weapon, and it doesn't appear to have mods to increase it.
---
No, only one may be placed
---
True. Fisto wasn’t goofy at all. Super super serious stuff.
---
So u shot back
---
Try r/FO76builds, I posted two of mine there. If you want to discuss builds and have Discord, can talk about it later tonight if you want. There's a lot of flexibility in the system, and post-50 you can basically respec if you want (move one point from another category per level), so nothing is set in stone.
---
For the fireflies one just look in the mire. My camp is there and I see them all the time
---
Only thing you're missing out on is frustration and loss of many stimpacks. Wouldn't even bother honestly.
---
Even if the squatch always dropped 3 stars, people would cry when they don't get their dream drop.  My armor is not rounded out even after 124 levels.  I have yet to get an explosive weapon to drop.  I'm fine with it, gives me something to keep pursuing.  The game is grind, as is should be.
---
Try doing the squatch event and spending the entire time as the conduit, with no one defending you and burning through a dozen or more stimpacks only to get absolutely nothing from the squatch even though you hit her a few times while vulnerable.  All for some radaway and another damn fedora.  
---
There is nothing to be 'fixed' with legendary drops.  3 star enemies have a chance to drop 3 star items, no guarantees.

What was the start of the downhill with 4? I mean each game has its own personality to it seeing on what time period in the fallout universe they take place in.  4 and 76 are still very mature, especially if you actually listen to the holotapes and read some terminal entries, they can be pretty dark. A lot of the stuff is pretty serious and very mature. 
---
Just my two cents.
---
I have this happen regularly. I also get stuck at crafting benches too sometimes.
---
Fo76rtnite
---
Marine wetsuit ontop &gt;:)
---
That's great!  We will miss you, but understand.
---
Dream scenario is the helmet and suit are separate, and the helmet works like a Gas Mask
---
I mean if you are just going about your daily routine and you get a notice saying the event is happening, there's no harm in checking it out. But do go through the headache of spending caps to make the event happen or server hopping.
---
On now, GT is my username
---
I it really worse t g an near constant stuttering though?  Both make the game unplayable imo
---
Have this same problem, tried dropping everything and tried applying the mods. Didn't work, seems to be the single use mods I bought from vendors that will not apply to armor or weapons.
---
Or even worse try to do it on survival. Everyone finially killing it because you act as three conduits getting one shot as soon as the mission completes and then a team of losers camp the assaultron body until I despawned killing anyone trying to come back and loot it. 
---
There need to be a timer on survival were you still on a force team for a few minutes within a certain radius.
---
I had a guy that kept asking me for serums but only wanted to pay 200 caps. Numerous times I told him I can sell them to the vendors for 500. After about 2hrs of messaging between the two of us he bought them for 500.
---
No, i must have hit them not realizing pacifist mode was turned off during the SQB fight. I mean it was a two shot exploding minigun i picked up from a vendor for 547 caps. It's aoe is huge. They waited until the SQB conclusion and two shot me even though 107&gt;176 :/
---
Since I started the game the only game breaking experience I had was getting swarmed by immortal ghouls.
---
I didn't know that, I've never seen them except for randomly once on the forest and them at the lighthouse during the event :)
---
Definitely. I think they want ya to purchase those repair kits lok
---
Ohhhh gotcha ..sorry man
---
It's know, Bethesda has not acknowledged it here, but they have on support tickets, customers being told next patch
---
dungeons will be instanced so can be run over and over
---
Anything that is from the atom shop auto destroys when you drop it so that you cannot give it away to other players.
---
I might try it if I literally trip over it.  Part of me is thinking it’ll probably crap out on me and get a server disconnect.
---
This doesn't happen to every piece of armor or every mod. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't
---
There is a new step in the process of repairing. Not sure on ur console but on PS4 it used to just be triangle button to repair. Now it shows as repair/inspect. After pushing triangle you then push square to repair it. Threw me off at first too.
---
There are two ways, if you drop it, Anyone can just jump in it and steal it. If you place it with X then it remains yours and gets auto recalled back to inventory if you leave it out for longer than a minute without getting in
---
I know right?
---
Ur comment was rude and I was bored at work..I couldn't care less actually
---
I would love more hairstyle options in general, none of them quite fit my characters just right. But that one in particular would be amazing.
---
Before the patch the enemies were still neutral but you could target them. I’m not sure why they are counted as neutral anyway, they are your enemies!
---
Xbox one, thanks though
---
People wouldn't "cry" if they don't get their dream drop. 3 Star enemies should drop 3 star items. Especially if it's a SBQ or Sheepsquatch Imposter. Getting 1 star items from these challenging/high level events obviously shows something needs to be fixed. I don't want to do end-game events just to be rewarded with trash I can buy from a vendor that someone didn't want for 100 caps.
---
Did you happen to see if you had the one pre patch overrepaired?
---
Sorry. Super new to using reddit. XBox name DolonRanger
---
The point of getting 3 star drop isn't just to get your dream weapon.   A three start piece of loot that's useless to your build might have value in trading for stuff you really do want.
---
Forest disease cures are really easy, run from Vaultec Agricultural Center along the dried up river until you reach the big river along the west of the map. Along the way you will get countless bloodleaf and snaptail plants. Then go to Slocam Joes for the fire caps.
---
With the Chemist and Super Duper perk you will make way more than you ever need.
---
I'm on PC, I will sell loads of disease cure to anyone who will meet the price of even what the vendors pay.
---
I go one step more and use antibiotics for the +50% disease resistance for 1h.
---
a few caps at the vendors when you pass by.  like op said low caps and low weight like combat knives
---
That’s how I saw it, I just wanted to fight the new boss and that wouldve been enough to make me happy. Even if we didn’t kill it or if we did and nothing good dropped. The sheep’s head was just a bonus
---
If they make anti armor itself target both Dr and er you're going to have a stupidly bad time against the imposter sheepsquatch and friends
---
Never drop? I got the sheep head on my first try and so did the guy I was playing with
---
They could easily build future dlc which grants you access to “seed” bunkers like the one in Norway
---
You can do path of enlightenment solo. I do it all the time
---
Xbox. Confirmed. 
---
But, I've noticed that dropping the item you want to mod in a bag and picking it up can work. Or yoir stash to be safe. Not consistent, but it works. Comfy right up alongside of the stat window disappearing when repairing. 😞
---
They aren't really worth doing right now anyway. I suggest up eight forest maps yesterday and got seven ivory grip plans. RNG is still bugged on that plan for maps.
---
\+1. Can't attach extra claw to my deathclaw gauntlet.
---
you can still do your route.  nobody is stopping you bro
---
I can confirm to you that the burrows does not lead to the arktos underground. That is going to be a seperate place accessed through arktos pharma itself
---
Yep.  In a weird way it’s good that a lot of the quests have been pretty basic and formulaic, go here, pick this up, do this etc...If the server crashes it’s no biggie.  However, when the quests have a bit to them and require a bit more investment from the player in the form of time and effort, it’s gets to be real ball ache when the server invariably fails.  Makes you think can I really be arsed to even try.
---
Oh, well it was fun trying to find the treasure so I guess I have that.
---
Ps4
---
The SBQ drops absolute garbage anyway and sometimes doesn’t drop anything at all. It’s really no loss to not be able to kill it. The real loss is the ammo but you control that .
---
With the new money pool system this doesn’t seem bad to me.   You can make that in 21 hours
---
Will do in a min
---
It's gotten to the point where I almost don't even bother looting legendary enemies anymore, especially if they're below level 50. In my 670 hours of play I can count the number of relevant 3-star loot drops I've gotten on one hand. It's infuriating.
---
Says the guy that apparently hasn’t learned his lesson from calling someone a cuck earlier.  When you resort to insults, you’re out of argument.
---
check on r/fo76filthycasuals
---
Ya cause x6 or x7 damage wouldn't be OP or anything,lol.
---
Can you elaborate, I have a bloodied grognax axe and have the perk cards that increase two handed weapon damage but I’m nowhere near good enough to take on a SBQ by myself while everyone stands around
---
For the average player 2500 caps for a 1 star is BS.
---
Those are great!  Yeah it's also a sort of roleplay thing for me as well--I journey through the wasteland documenting my findings.  I love coming across stuff like that.
---
Congratulations. I don't give a shit about the sheep head and never  said I did.
---
Not really. It's just not worth arguing with someone who cant seem to comprehend the arguements being made.
---
Interested. Is Turner-1976 username on XBox?
---
That sounds pretty good.  I was definitely getting a bit over my current Flatwoods camp.
---
Yea same. I just did it three times while server hopping tonight.
---
BLUBLZRedeux
---
laser rifle
---
So what are you pissed about not getting them?
---
They changed how this works. You now need to go into the inspect screen in the workbench tok repair things
---
I'd say its worth it the weapon is so good that I've started using it instead of my op vats rifle maybe its because it works with my build. and no I didn't farm the event I was just playing through it and I got those plans.
---
I'll be offline all weekend due to work but will be on Sunday night.
---
I’m pretty sure the scorchbeast queen drops 3 star legendaries
---
I don't think I ever played a full session without lag of some type creeping in. And like others there have been tmes I just have to stop playing and chill until the servers recover.
---
You can find more treasure maps for the same location. Maybe save those until they improve the tables a bit.
---
I got a couple of good armor plans in Toxic Valley so those might be a better shot.
---
Somewhat true, but the Queen does drop some plans you can get nowhere else except for incredibly expensive vendor buys. I mean serum recipes, etc...
---
You should try to shoot it as you do 25% more damage while a conduit for the pylon
---
I think Wolf was killed when he tried to recall the Assaultron, either the Assaultron itself killed him or the Pylons fried him but I do remember a corpse in the cabin with the recall terminal
---
That would be really cool! I think I'm too chicken shit to pull something like that off.
---
How is the Conduit role not a dps? Each pylon gives its conduit 25% more damage
---
Me too.
---
Yeah lag i also have ofc. But this i freezing / staggering every 3 seconds. 
---
For example i aim in vats and shoot , if it staggers the ghouls is hitting me when it continues .
---
It's still up for debate. Either way, people who are unable to damage the Queen while a very few must carry and expend vast resources is not helpful.
---
Me too, but for ESO. Which is maddening since they’re part of the same GD company. Like, did not one person from Bethesda go “Hey our sister studio develops one of the most popular MMOs in existence, let’s ask for some pointers!”??
---
You do 25% more damage as a conduit so shoot all the things!
---
Can't you just put one bullet in the sheepsquatch to get loot credit?
---
Yes, if you could optimize a build at will, that would be OK. But you can't, and making only melee or ranged viable hurts game diversity.
---
They nerfed selling hats to vendors?
---
This happens to me all the time, especially in the clubhouse. When the game glitches like this run run run to the clubhouse. Last time I slayed almost 50 robots and they were all legendarys lol love it
---
White springs or harpers fary
---
No idea what you mean bud, I power all the power plants up almost all the time. I like helping people who have the workshops around the area.
---
I started hoarding all legendaries after the vendor announcement. Took like 2 hours then I started scrapping all the garbage 1 star stuff. Then a couple hours later the lame 2 star stuff. Keeping the 3 star stuff for now, but might end up dumping the really heavy lame stuff (cyolator).  The vendor is just too far out to hoard until the week of release.
---
Launch yet?
---
Yo same on my first
---
to be fair though, weight as a whole is wonky in this game.
---
a handmade should not weigh more than a 50 cal HMG.
---
like even looking at models, the HMG is more than twice the size of the handmade, and you expect me to believe the handmade is made out of lead or the HMG is made out of plastic?
---
Keep in mind that my initial comment was about people who to tot the trouble of spending caps to make this quest happen and end up with shit loot.  I am not one of those people. I have not spent a penny to make the quest happen and I never will and I fully expected the loot to be garbage. I got a notice saying the event was happening and  out of curiosity I checked it out. I doubt that I will next time.
---
It's a bug as of last patch. You cannot apply loose mods to weapons/armor. Can only apply ones you know.
---
Can confirm for PC. "Consumable" mods will not attach to weapons of power armor. Haven't tested regular armor.
---
I laughed so hard. Stocking up on those fedoras though. Gotta keep it classy out there.
---
That's a good one to know. Thank you!
---
No i'm sure that vaults just there for decoration you should be fine.....
---
The quest line only opens up the bunker and a single door to it.    
---
He's asking about the rows of cabins out around the greens
---
If you like that area there is an oil deposit to the left of the vault. It’s a nice area. Had my camp there for a while now.
---
well said
---
Whatever is closest to the sheepsquatch event, 
---
I threw down a quick 2 story hostel full of beds and a small workshop shack full of benches for anyone to use before and after the event.
---
So normally i just hit up Lewisburg.
---
Yes, why are you doing that?
---
Know issue, reported and documented on a few round up threads.  
---
The Fallout 4 engine this is based on doesn't have a built in mechanic for lowering ER, hopefully they will add one in time.
---
No, not the plant.  The sub quest afterwards to get your fusion cores for pa
---
Yep, can confirm for PS4. Been trying to fit calibrated shocks since the update. It is highly frustrating
---
&gt;...it is as if they don’t want us to do the dailies
---
Now why on earth would they want that?
---
It’s simple, make earning atoms harder to get so that more people give in and pay for them.
---
He is in the game his flag just hasn't been enabled by Bethesda so we won't be seeing him until they do
---
Want to sell the handmade so you have more to spend?
---
Aww dang. Do you know where to find the plans for the X-01? I didn’t see any at the Bunker. I really hope this gets fixed soon
---
X01 has no plans that can be learned. Only loose mods
---
You can't get any of the others yet. They aren't attached to a currently in use loot pool
---
I also spent about an hour in my latest camp, turning the camp module and moving it around yesterday
---
From what I can tell the drill head looking piece typically points in the direction it will spawn you, with the note that it'll be around 5ish feet of that spot.
---
Did you do All Rise? That helped me out to no end at your level. Watoga is yours once that's done... You can casually roam the city hunting legendary robots. Sometimes you hit a streak of legendary spawns and get some decent loot and xp too.
---
76 is a permanent Wild Wacky Wasteland trait from NV
---
Yea were all assuming the same, since the new cryptid map now got updated to show harpers ferry ala the burrows circled as a part of the cryptid hunt
---
X01 has no mods that can be learned. Only loose mods.
---
I was just pointing out if you were traveling efficiently you wouldn't waste half your caps on fast travel beforehand? 
---
Did you even read bro?
---
My favorite is if you fast travel to Slocum joes. Move forward a bit and look down in the crack in the road! Have a gnome with a baby gnome in a stroller!
---
My game froze
---
Yep mine too
---
Oh no, you’re absolutely right. The weights in this game are jacked up big time. A real M2 Browning, which the .50 is based on, weighs a little over 83 pounds (38kg). An AK47 is 7-8 pounds (3-3.5kg). I’m in no way defending the way they’ve done the weights in this game. My only point was that for armor to be useless, it has to be missing large pieces. A firearm will stop working if a part the size of my pinky nail breaks.
---
You can get legendaries from the event though so...
---
Yeah, because that shit is something less tedious by far....like I want to craft, carry, and then remember to eat all of it every 5 minutes be a use Bethesda so fucked they think that's what a good game does. 
---
No fing way. I'm surprised we don't have to shit n piss every 10 minutes too, or use ghoul hookers every day to avoid blueballs and the -10 core stat loss associated with it.
---
Demolitions Expert, the card you’re referring to, does indeed increase the damage of the Explosive effect on your Gatling Gun, however it’s been nerfed into the ground, making it pretty lackluster. A good perk to grab in return in the intelligence tree is the perk Stabilizer, which increases accuracy and adds armor pen, at the cost of having to be in power armor.
---
I got a automatic plasma rifle from a toxic valley treasure map
---
Join on me I think I got back in
---
Man I'm 363 and still rocking the Raider PA
---
This right here. \^ Couldn't agree with you more.
---
Will trade you sheepsquatch mascot outfit and fedora for a imposter mask
---
So the way legendary spawns work is this. If a. Enemy is level 0-10 they have a 1% chance to be legendary. At 11 - 20 its a 2% chance. So on up to level 41+ which has a 5% chance. All fo the chances are doubles in a nuke zone
---
It’s a big event I’ll never be able to accomplish by myself, and so I go to experience it when it happens. I just saw another post saying the enemies don’t even level with more players, so which is it ya know?
---
Nuking something is the larger equivalent of a workshop. Everyone knows where the actions going down and you open yourself up when you do it.
---
Not possible unless you pull out the credit card. 😣
---
I would note that the only cryptid not having some sort of FEV or other experiment origin is the Mothman
---
Go too armor and might be in helms
---
We won't be getting anything added. The burrows is already in the game they just have to enable it like they did with the parade
---
Do events like Uranium Fever and the Horde Events ( ones in the Mire and Cranberry Bog are best). Try killing any ScorchBeasts you can ( Try the BrotherHood outposts at the Bog). Also I’ve been able to find at least a 2 or 3 star enemy at the NAR Repair Yard.
---
Is Anyone Selling Fasnacht Confetti or Fasnacht Balloon Plans?
---
Sounds like you guys didn't activate the pylons
---
Yeah, I have Demo Expert(and Grenadier) maxed, just wondering about the Heavy Gunner perks as they specify non explosive.  I would think they would work with the legendary effect but just want to be sure before I invest the perks in it.
---
This is great. I hope Bethesda keeps expanding the lore in all these locations.
---
Will have to double check, you may be right.
---
Oh, that’s what you meant. Heavy Gunner increases the ballistic damage of the Gatling Gun and any other Heavy Weapon regardless of the effect.
---
Dude, I don't give a shit...You use Cuck as an insult and you're defending that stupidity on the open internet. 
---
Just...don't.
---
I thought I was the only one who saw that one
---
You're absolutely right,The assaultron even says overwriting SheepSquatch during the holotape, so it's not like it loaded up sheepsquatch mating rituals, it loaded up a  Sheepsquatch personality, which is why it is acting as the real sheepsquatch.
---
Hence the title "In-pastaSquatch" I mean "Sheepsquatch Imposter"
---
Yeah I sneaked by a radroach and we never touched and still got a disease ,guess diseases are airborne now :/
---
The real one is part of an event and some random encounters currently but his flag has not been enabled by beth
---
Yeeeah...the things the mods ban for, and the things the mods allow in this subreddit make me kinda irked.
---
Nah that happens every once in a while. I just leave and come back later or jump servers. I didn',t realize there were legendaries around with the eyebots.
---
I have issues with the VP of the company's word not being worth shit, more than that specific bit of P2W bullshit.
---
Yeah, sorry, reading it back it is a bit confusing.  Good to know the Heavy Gunner perks will work even with the explosive effect.  Thanks!
---
Hate it now. I also had a problem with the weapons workbench. After repairing a weapon, the stats for my other weapons were misding.. So couldn't see what needed to be fixed, had to back out and go back.
---
Yeah, and I'm not the only one. Other people just stop posting when they get karma bombed for stating their current experiences.
---
I think engine limitations could not allow something like that.
---
How do you get your melee even up to 300?? I’ve been stuck at 200 forever
---
Tell them you'll pay 5 bucks for it and it'll be up tommorow
---
yut r/fo76filthycasuals
---
All good and no prob. I’d really advise you to look into that Stabilizer perk in Intelligence, it makes guns like the Gatling with really spread accuracy a laser beam, but like I said, you need Power Armor for it to work.
---
I did say "most". I haven't found a thing about the Mothman yet, so I wasn't sure about it. And the Flatwood Monster kinda looks like a robot to me, so I wasn't sure about that, either.
---
Try heading over to Big Al's Tattoo Parlor &amp; speak with Biv. That will trigger it for you.
---
Haha. What little baby you must be. Go hide in your safe space kiddo.
---
I heard beam splitter doesn’t multiply your damage it just splits the damage between multiple beams so each beam does less damage but you have more beams so it acts like a shotgun spread
---
I'll keep it in mind.  I rarely use PA, but if it helps my build I'd be down to try it.  Gonna be a few levels before I see the results.  Thanks again.
---
I am so sick of those fedoras. Is there a white suit that goes with it at least?
---
Ahh the flatwoods monster I believe is a Zetan or Alien for the fallout uninitiated.
---
And mothman has a few notes and stuff that mention him being around LOOOOONG before any weird experiments 
---
^also ^the ^Mothman ^is ^real
---
Added!
---
I just tried that. Talked to him but nothing happened. 
---
I already had the quest line started, up to the point where you open the security door. I didn’t finish it before the update, and now the quest isn’t even on my list of quests. 
---
I just want to be able to build the brewing stand.
---
I've heard PA is terrible for pvp
---
Or maybe go to the FUCKING DOCTOR it’s very rude he’s been waiting for you also your doctor died and his funeral was 200 years ago so there’s a lot to unpack there
---
What sub quest? You power the plant and that's it?
---
I had this problem with the new quest yesterday. It's definitely a bug.  But, I was able to back out to the main menu &amp; restart. The quest finally appeared for me again. Give that a shot.
---
Yep mods are buged right now got to wait till a hotfix or a patch
---
So lucky, I didn't find any till 25.
---
I have 3 Power armors now (2 on me: Excavator and T60 armor). I have 1 at home I got from Brotherhood quest.
---
So, do you have any favorite weapons yet? I liked the machete for a while myself and a shotgun at that low level.
---
The Nukashine paint's going to be obtained in-game? Where did you hear that?
---
Shit if I know. All I know is Calvin programmed an assaultron to imitate a sheepsquatch in heat to lure out the real sheepsquatch. He messed up the programming and coded the assaultron to act like the real sheepsquatch instead who is a raging murderer. So the assaultron killed him and you have to now kill the assaultron.
---
Rare outfits he could sell for caps
---
FIGHT NIGHT 1 IS LIVE!!’ Come on down!
---
I would love to get this as a boss
---
Thank you. I will give it a shot. Hopefully it will be patched soon then. My character build is alcohol based so it would suck not being able to complete this quest. 
---
At first I thought that bethesda might have locked the quest out, now that the sheepsquatch is out, but that doesn’t make any since.
---
True. Im not a big fan of the Atom Shop, they should just add in hairstyles like they did with the dlc in Fallout 4.
---
Pretty much most people are running in sentinel or cavalier assassins armour which makes you pretty much indestructible and far out classes pa, most combat armour with perks has more damage and energy resistance than the excavator pa has
---
Oh yes. That's it. I'm a baaby, who needs a "Safe place" meanwhile, you get this defensive when someone tells you how stupid your go-to insult makes you sound.
---
For sure. I wouldn't mind buying dlc packs but the greed has gotten out of hand in games in general
---
More hairstyles in general would be nice. The cosmetics section of the store is pretty neglected...
---
I feel this in my soul, man. I gathered all kinds of decor for my camp &amp; just recently got rid of all of it but the yellow fasnacht beer steins (Probably won't see those around for another yr). But, hopefully they will implement the camp display cases/junk decor before the next big patch. I get it, they want it to work, but don't make promises you can't keep. 
---
Way to shit the bed, Bethesda...
---
Should be fine 👍 But straight damage mitigation is far better for staying alive . Atleast in pve
---
Yes and every Fallout game *must* do the exact same thing over and over. Every Assassin's Creed must be Ezio stabbing people. Every Call of Duty must b...oooooh.
---
How do you have the jump on somebody in adventure mode if they don’t take damage unless they choose to fight back? How do you decide when PVP starts if you’re the attacker? It’s the person you’re attacking that decides when PVP starts by deciding when to hit you back. That also gives them the first full damage shot of the fight.
---
I think they're all different. I can't speak for 1 or 2 as I never played them but Fallout 3 went very traditional post apocalyptic and it had a serious tone.  New Vegas was more of a post post apocalyptic game, where society has already been built up quite a bit and it's no longer about survival, but about power. A serious tone mostly with some humor in there.
---
Fallout 4 went back to the post apocalyptic feel that 3 had but in a more bright and happy way. This is partly due to the voiced protagonist and partly due to the map too. The story had a sadness to it for sure but that ended once you got to The Institute. There was more humor here than in 3.
---
76 is a completely different game, it currently is not an RPG, it's a looter shooter for one. The map doesn't look anything like Fallout. The Toxic Valley is the closest thing to Fallout. The number one difference is it's online. There was no possibility that it could follow the same approach the other games took. It's impossible to get every player in the world to act serious or like they are a part of the world. So seeing things like an Easter Bunny Head or a Santa Claus outfit fits this game quite well because that is the type of game it is. It's an online games as a service game.
---
It's more in line with Fortnite than it is with any previous Fallout but I think that is okay, it's what the game is and honestly it's pretty fun to be able to play a Fallout game leisurely and not have to worry about role playing a character and getting into it. There have been many times when I'm doing a playthrough of Skyrim or Fallout 4 or New Vegas and I while I'm enjoying it, there are nights when I simply don't feel like stepping into the shoes of another character and living out their life.
---
In this I just created my Fallout 4 character because I liked his look and just play it like I'd play a Fortnite or GTA Online. It's a great experience for someone who s too lazy to get into a story based game like 3, 4 and NV.
---
Thanks that went well :)
---
Is there a limit on PC? I don't think so.
---
I world-changed 20 times yesterday, and was looking for a path of enlightenment event for the daily
---
This morning, I somehow get a world with the event going on, and it fails at 45/50.
---
Yay !
---
So much fun !
---
For 10 atoms !
---
I buy atoms, I bought quite a few, but now, I will not buy anymore, because Bethesda is being unfair with this system. It was fair in the beginning, but not anymore.
---
Alas, I am a minority, most people won't think it and will simply buy more.
---
I'll gladly take the sheeps mask....Only thing I'm missing from that event. Well, about the only thing I cared about. 
---
But I feel you on this one, I can't even get anything because it glitches out for me besides the first time I did it....
---
They seem to have broke mods last patch. I have a shotgun mod I want to put on my legendary Tesla Rifle and it simply does not work, and the mod is not acquirable via any other method 😕
---
Nope not at all..
---
Just showing what the original creators  idea of fallout was to what it is now.
---
All games should evolve
---
Holy shit, lol. For a second I thought you also had a death claw behind you at the start, from one of the roars.
---
Ok cool. 
---
I did have my dr up to 450 but I really wanted this bolstering arm piece because I'm doing the bloodied thing
---
No, the quest line is permanent. I was under the impression that the hotfix today would have fixed that error, but,  as usual, it probably just made things worse. Lol.  Bethesda will get it together someday.  I have faith in that. It's a great game, so I'm tolerant to the BS that comes with it.
---
It's duped eBay armor. P2w
---
Honestly I wouldn’t be surprised. I think Bethesda just wanted me dead
---
I use an insult one time and it's my "go to"? Lol. Ok. Again, your white knighting isnt needed here as the only one offended is you.
---
SBQ is bullet sponge, this one is insta kill. Thats not powerfull, just unbalanced.
---
Fissure Prime also doesn’t count as a fissure site for fissure-related challenges. Yeah.
---
As far as im aware, there arent headlamp upgrades for the excavator, and ive seen every other type of lamp in 200+ playing
---
There is no end to the Overseers quest. Even if you get all the tapes. The end of the game is when you drop a nuke to take on the Queen
---
Alright that’s good to know lol Going to give it another try in a bit and see if it will pop back up for me. Thanks again.  Yeah I really enjoy playing it and messing around. Just want it to be the best it can be.
---
That’s old news
---
You can vote me down for disagreeing if you want but it’s been data mined and shown that it doesn’t. 
---
Maybe a single player game would be more your speed.
---
If you have 9friends thats 250 per event for each cause loot is shared. So if you get 30 friends it may be eventualy worth it.
---
Not true. If he owned a shop he could still be killed while in Pacifist. If he's teamed and a team member who's not in Pacifist flagged other players as hostile, he too would be in PvP while in Pacifist. 
---
It only prevents you from dealing damage to other players, thereby initiating PvP. Once you're flagged for PvP either by a contested workshop or a team member engaging in PvP, it's effect is suspended.
---
Have none of you done that sidequest in Diamond City in Fallout 4? It's called Matchmaking or something.
---
If you get lucky and get lots of toads, it’s pretty easy. Otherwise make sure you aren’t encumbered and sprint around a lot. The fireflies respawn fast but you gotta loot them all!
---
Who sells the board?
---
It's sb bs
---
I got two fedora, Maskot head and imposter outfit. Aaaand 4x failed since then, if i get on server where event was triggeret.
---
Lol. Cant even fit that many on the servers.
---
No worries. Lmk if it worked out for you. We'll figure this shit out together! Lol. 
---
And it will be.. By the end of Summer, this game is going to be so fucking bad ass :D
---
yes I did.  I understand and wasn't being hostile
---
Oh look at this guy with 9 friends. Do you have any friends you’re willing to loan out? /s
---
I appreciate your enthusiasm for sarcasm, but to become a master you mustn't use /s.
---
*I'm a human being, and this action was performed manually.*
---
God it brings back memories of cazorclaw
---
yea. that sb is sob. it's hard to fight it with all the damn trees around.
---
How? It’s not out yet.
---
All you can do is hope on the mic and say something, I know there are people who know what to do and are just being assholes, but more than a few of the people jumping in are causal's that don't know any better. 
---
Even more so because A few times I've jumped to the event it said I joined but absolutely **none** of the event objectives popped up and I knew what to do.
---
All you can do is let those who may be uninformed know what needs to be done, ignore the idiots who know better and are still not doing the pylon objectives, and be patient with people.
---
Get a hazmat suit, way better than PA for rad resist.  They're all lvl 1.
---
Thank you for that! Got the achievment from the first try!
---
I just got back in after being off for two months, whitesprings was nuked and no one seemed to care , back in the day people rushed in to grind it , seems like no one cares nowadays
---
It's not a limited time event, just pace yourself and do it when it's available.
---
I am 204 level with 4/5sentinel armor, so i should survive longest of all players around. 20stims didn't last me even till boss regenerated his HPs. Maybe if there are some people with auto guns who kills those adds, it may be good, but every event i was on is fucking chaos with insta death mechanics.
---
It’s made to make you want to spend money. That’s literally it.
---
It happened for me a few days ago. Here I wanted to try out 17 gigs of updates.. first came the controls freeze, then I'm booted.
---
My old character was a mess so im currently lvl 15
---
Yeah I’ll just go back to not playing the game. I’ll try back in another couple months.
---
Reminds me of the railway rifle not working with the rifle perks.
---
Hahaha! I can’t wait to see what the vaults will be like. Going to be fun for sure
---
I think that's my issue, I shoot them and then can't find the bodies, or whack them with my All-Star and they go flying away hah
---
Why is it that when im at white springs all the enemies are lvl 45+. Im lvl 15 so it is a problem atm.
---
The problem isn't just in how high the infection rate is, it's also in HOW infections are transmitted.  
---
It used to be that if you ran into a diseased enemy you risked an infection when they hit you, but at one point they changed it so all you need to do is get too close and they cough on you and you're sick.  Same thing with glowing enemies which can give you glowing pustules and rad worms as soon as you get close enough for the rads to start ticking.
---
Charging barrels currently has a bug where if you shoot the ground or wall without charging, it will bounce to the baddie and act like it was fully charged.
---
Yessss!  Super pumped about the Vault Raids
---
For adhesive make a farm. Mutfruit corn and tatos. For junk scrap enemies weapons. Will give you steel and other bits.
---
Currently running a bloodied shotgun build with about 200 DR, because I'm having an absolutely shocking run on legendary armor and I can't be bothered to trade.
---
It's not so bad, you just have to cripple everything before it kills you.
---
I was walking through watoga the other day and I was watching the protections collapse all around me one by one
---
Yeah Flare gun doesn't serve any purpose other than to play with it.
---
The funny thing is...Its almost exactly what we've been asking for.  Something that can absolutely destroy us, and has some new mechanics (YES, THIS THING HAS ACTUAL MECHANICS!!!) that are kinda cool...and it isn't solo-able, but not because it takes 1000000 rounds of ammo to kill it.
---
Yeah, lowest you can possibly get it is 1850. That's with HB at 3, grape mentats - CHR at 18. Used the CHR bobble head and it still remained at 1850
---
Yeah. Every time I do a White Springs run, I always get rad worms or something like that. *Every* time!
---
Zodd the immortal
---
What I mean is find holotapes in game to play songs from the game.
---
Both perk and legendary effect affect the pip-boy damage, anyway.
---
it's bugged consumable mods are broken atm.
---
only the crafted mods work
---
For workbenches, I have muscle memory of hitting X to get started. Now it's A, Ugh.
---
I'll keep that in mind, thanks.
---
I don't understand paying 2000 caps part.  I'm assuming flux means you built prime shotgun shells.
---
I absolutely agree with the drop though.  As a sneak, bloodied, melee, I delivered a good 50% of the damage dealt at the one I did tonight.  Even the killing blow.  I got a one star zealot's wood chest piece.  You've GOT to be kidding me...
---
I do like the fact that people are paying obscene amounts of caps for these hats/masks.  Sell them now!!!
---
I have the opposite problem.. level 9 ghouls and I’m 180....You just have to server hop to get them to your level.
---
I think this has been posted about 500 times, but I still agree.  Travel across the board for one thistle or tarberry... just dang!
---
power up the fusion core maker is what he's saying.
---
Exactly the thing i am suffering rn. Lol.
---
But to unlock shishkebab mod, even minimum level of that item consume way too much materials.
---
Apparently that got fixed with this patch, though.
---
Oops.. I didn’t realise they were bugged.  I used about 6 copies of one yesterday purely as I was in the vicinity :(
---
Think I’ll hold off using the others now
---
You can only mod item but cannot attach consumable mod to item.
---
I was serverhoping 2hours and there was not one single  Path to Enlightenment. Only 2x that new robot mordor. I didn't even find 5toys yesterday (in eu is 7am) haha.
---
I agree. When barely any of the options look good anyway, there need to be improvements.
---
No. Flux is needed to craft the recall card and the recall card board its self is 2500 caps unless you have hard bargain and max charisma which takes it down to 1950 caps
---
I have a TSE minimum and the heavy weapons perk does indeed work with it, despite that it's explosive.    It's not accurate to say that a TSE heavy weapon has been nerfed to the point of being useless because heavy weapons have had a very different history. 
---
  
---
Yes, TSE got nerfed, but after that ALL heavy weapons got a buff. That  included  TSE heavy weapons, which put them pretty much where they need to be in terms of damage output.
---
How do I pass this along then? I've been begging for new hair since release and we still don't have a single style we didn't see in 4.
---
Ahhhhh, gotcha.
---
I do not bother with using stimpacks i just die, respawn and charge right back into battle. 
---
Do agree that the prize for killing it is not worth the trouble. The only reason i am now doing the battle is to assist other players with the kill.
---
Mechanics? 20 exploding robots spawning in small area, with op damage gusties and invisible oneshot killing machine. That would be still good. If he wasn't immortal when you don't use 3pylons, which will kill you in seconds, because all robots focus you or wtf and it is one big chaos. I wanted raid/event where you have roles, or something like that. No this non-sense with just huge damage.
---
Just went to Biv. Still nothing when I try to talk to him. 
---
Also tried reactivating the poster, and that didn’t work. 
---
Wondering if I get the ingredients, and just craft nukashine, would that work? Even though I don’t actually have the quest anymore.
---
One step at a time I guess.
---
That's pretty much exactly what's happening to me. They are all (but one) dead before I get there or DOA, and I just get to watch the XP and loot disappear before my eyes. Somehow doesn't happen ever when I'm on a team.
---
Looks like they decided to  form a raid and took you out.  What kind of loot did you drop?  I am pretty sure they're tired of "bags of garbage" loot I drop.
---
Nope, my friends stoped playing when patch xy (don't remember which number) again fucked up and broken adrenal reaction mutation. But we can make group, of raiders, and kill people.
---
No joke. I'm level 268 and I've gotten 4 3\* items. 2 from the Queen,, 1 from West-Tek, 1 from AWOL Armaments. My whole gear, with the exception of a Bloodied 1\* Handmade, is literally made of pieces I have been gifted by kind souls or bought from vendors after lucky people sold off what they didn't want...
---
The RNG in this game is nothing but hot garbage.
---
It seems a lot of people are conflating the Arktos Pharma underground area with the Burrows beneath Harpers Ferry.
---
" Fallout 76's server size is 24 to 32, "
---
you cant giveit away or even drop the gear it will tell you that it will get destroyed, and if BGS would allow that to happen it will defeat the porpuse off the atom shop.
---
I'm not sure but alright.
---
Woooow thanks so much for this comprehensive and informative comment that you really must’ve put so much thought into. If you’ve read the thread thus far you’d see that I plan on moving once I’m done with my current quests, but this is the most reasonable spot for me for now.
---
Pretty sure it's just 24 but either way it's still not worth is the point
---
There is a crit receiver. After that it's trying out different barrels to increase range and accuracy, most importantly trying to keep the weight down though. Some chose to run dot sight and standard stock to keep weight down. Less weight means more shots in vats. Armor piercing mag is worth the weight IMO.
---
When you power up the power plant the power box right next to the fusion generator will provide enough power to power the fusion generator. Or you can build generators to do that and skip the powering up event.
---
Thanks for help! :)
---
Oh well
---
I can craft it for you. Psn is tuchflufygetdizy. Don't have a suit tho
---
What platform are you on? Depending on the level, I'd be willing to trade the handmade for the set. I'm on PC, however.
---
Might need a team to take them on when they come out
---
VATS and a laser pistol work well for fireflies.
---
Thx. Just trying to find simple to implement suggestions that make for more emergent gameplay
---
I already found someone for shielded, thank you though.
---
You should tag enemies with your tiny pistol, or you will be 31level forever.
---
No.  I just did the entire power plant tonight, finished quest and all that but was unable to power fusion core. 
---
I’m going to assume then that it’s still broken
---
Yeah, oh ok. I knew the was in the 76 sub, but thought the comment chain was people talking about 4, lol.
---
As someone raised in E TN, that's how I say it.
---
No worries
---
I personally haven't blueprinted in a while. Not being able to put my camp back in place if I move it has essentially stopped me from building
---
Bot vendors do show them all now.
---
You just have to click RS to inspect(or maybe LS, can't remember) and it shows them all.
---
I was disappointed that this wasn't added to the player transactions.
---
This is good. Encountered my first rad storm the other day, never even thought of checking the flora ‘cause I was like ‘cool a rad storm!’ and at the same time muttering ‘quit giving me rads I’m crafting ammo in my wooden shack!’
---
Well then that might be a bug are you sure the wire is connected to the generator from the power box
---
At low levels I would replace weapons and armor instead of repairing. Often times it is cheaper to make something new rather than repair it.
---
Yes, I believe it's because of the introduction of the renaming feature and possibly the repair kits coming out. Note that after clicking ∆ on PS4 to inspect it shows 'workbench repair' and has the Rename function.
---
Also, really need those Brotherhood Outpost objects.
---
Dude, just the other day I was taking on 3 honey beasts. 
---
Acid attack. 
---
Then they become scorched honey beasts and die. Right when I had their health down. No loot. 
---
Alright. 
---
I start nailing away at this scorchbeast. About 30 2mm later I have’m. 
---
Nope. Flies off. 
---
I give chase and see him off in the distance flopping around in the sky. Alright, train VATs....it’s a full health scorchbeast. 
---
So I start wailing on that guy. I have him at 1/2 health, eat some roach and reload....and server freeze. 
---
So now I’m down 50 or so 20mm. How much lead is that??  
---
With maxed out fireproof perk (I think?), scorchbeasts are just flying, time consuming, radroaches.  A simple sprint from an acid attack is all it takes. Put more of them in the sky, but make them deathclaw strength or something. And calm down on the scorched gangbang. I was just looting that dead deathclaw by the fissure, there were no frozen scorched just chilling. 
---
But seriously, this game is cool.
---
He doesn't look like a Zetan to me. It certainly doesn't look like the ones in 3, NV, or 4. 
---
And the Mothman we see also doesn't look like the Mothman IRL, so I wouldn't be surprised to find out the creature in the game is a government fuck up.
---
No. Calvin's intent was never to "mate" with the assultron. He was programming it with mating rituals in an attempt to draw out the real Sheepsquatch, but his programming failed, or rather, it's original programming was accidentally overwritten, rendering the assultron hostile. It simply killed him.
---
Yeah. Been an issue since launch it seems. 
---
I left for a bit and had just hoped it had been fixed. 
---
30 min quest and 30 caps for basically nothing.
---
I bought paint and I can only paint some armor. Perhaps it’s armor specific. But if I buy speckled paint I want it to look like camo at the Pride parade. 
---
Also, I noticed when repairing armor it will show me how low the durability is, I’ll repair, then the durability screen is blank for all of the others. 
---
I have to quit the bench to check out what to repair next, x5
---
I never even knew it was an issue maybe submit a ticket to let the devs know.
---
Not complaining, correcting you and stopping you from giving out incorrect information
---
So the prices have officially went up? 
---
My so is thinking of getting into selling them
---
It doesn't release until Tuesday, but feel free to add me. Avengel--
---
Eating adventurers all day makes scorchy gassy
---
When you have OP build and this shit kill you in seconds without healing and you need to have activated all three pylons at same time in chaos where are spawned like 20 oneshot-exploding robots, i am sorry, but i am avoiding being conduit after 3 failed events.
---
Saw the picture and it is GORGEOUS dude!
---
Also... now I wanna fight one! Forget Scorchbeasts, gimmie a winged Deathclaw!!!!!
---
Have you fought Flatwoods up close? It appears to have a zetan like head inside his little fishbowl.
---
Also, the Mothman thing is more a dig at my side flair.
---
But I would add that the Mothman in-game is more an amalgamation of all the reports and sightings and skeptic accounts.
---
I'll skeptics of the Mothman said people were just seeing large owls and confusing it with the Mothman, hence Mothman looking owlish. Just look at the Fasnacht owl head, it's basically the same head as Mothman. 
---
They've also taken into account some people saying Mothman is an omen of good ^wise ^Mothman and a ferocious monster ^vengeful/Stalking  ^Mothman
---
I now have Fermentable nukashine, but without the quest it won’t let me use the fermenter machine.
---
I don’t know. When I see a level 25 in the bog; I want to know his secret.
---
You on PSN? If so add me I just changed my name to crazycatshady
---
Strange, lowest hazmat suit I've seen is level 15
---
I don't have an OP build i didn't even know builds were a thing when I made my guy.
---
I've held all three pylons on more than four events, it is possible to solo but you should be working with the other people if you want to get it done.
---
While you're at it, mind getting the team to look at key binds in general to make them both consistent &amp; rebindable? Especially using z/c to navigate trade &amp; build ui but arrow keys for pipboy inventory.
---
I killed three 3 star enemies today and got no loot over 1 star. The other frustrating thing is that why are level 62 ghouls dropping level 35 weapons for my level 64 character?
---
They was droping them since beta.
---
I would help but im level 11.
---
I tried to play today for the first time in months. Every time i loaded near whitesprings or my camp i was being attacked before my one x finished loading.
---
The disconnects are annoying. I don't have any interest in PvP but I still like to take a workshop once in a while. To make sure I'm not screwed out of caps (from the servers) I'll team up beforehand. Last night I lost the same one *three times* to DCs very shortly after taking or defending it. *Twice* we were booted to the main menu to "waiting..." and then dumped in a new server with no workshop. I just straight up won't take another one anymore. 
---
Also since the last patch my performance on console has gotten much worse. Nearly every server regardless of what I'm doing is laggy and has a noticeable frame rate drop every 10-15 seconds.
---
Not solo-able at all? What you kill all the robots first and each time you hit the boss you quickly jump away. That was kind of working for me earlier tonight.
---
Dont forget bloody mess increases its damage. The weapon is meant to be used for sneak builds, as it's the same as a normal combat rifle but with stealth perks.
---
User ?
---
Hey, some advice. Look up "oxhorn exposed" on youtube. Guy is Notch level, typical neckbeard bad.
---
Psn is the same as my reddit username
---
The other triple a companies have microtransactions right, so that means they all would have had to do that?
---
Was just some random junk I had just scrapped. I decided to be a dumbass and try and run through and grab it again, wasting like 4 stimpaks.
---
Would you be willing to craft one for me? I would greatly appreciate it.
---
Please try older Fallouts.
---
I diasgree, like a lot. New Vegas was goofy as all hell, and the community praises it like a god. Now, i do agree the series has gotten "lighter" but i think that's just surface level to appeal to a larger market. The depravity, and struggle to survive is still in the games pretty much everywhere.
---
How low level?
---
I use the hatchet a lot. It’s fast and efficient just doesn’t do enough damage lol. For guns I don’t have a favorite yet as I use whatever I can find at the moment to survive lol (pistols and shotguns mostly) those are ok for now
---
13 lol
---
Here is someone who did it solo, so it's not impossible.
---
[Solo sheepsquatch](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bc3nsi/encryptid_event_solo_all_3_pylons/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)
---
But again, and I can't stress this enough, it is so much easier with teamwork. 
---
Just like the how the SBQ is easier if you have just a few properly kitted and perked people.
---
Low levels can be conduit because stims heal them for so much more, should always try to get more than one conduit to split the damage dealt.
---
Heavy hitters and cryoguys should be focusing on ISS.
---
Mid card guys should be keeping an eye on who is conduit and if they go down, rezzing them, quack surgeon works wonders to save your precious stims for yourself.
---
And there should be some people covering the adds so they don't overwhelm the conduits. 
---
Just going in with a group of three or four who you are communicating with and each taking a different space in the team can work wonders for completing the event.
---
I had to fix a weapon tonight and managed to get it done. I didn't know how I did it but you describe it perfectly lol. I was going to exit the game but it worked. Beth needs to fix this pronto, ridiculous. Also the weapons break quicker now 🙄
---
Is the bug eyed helmet not marine?
---
I *need* this. My ideal stealthy look would just be the BoS officer underarmor and I am a complete pushover without my armor on.
---
Xbox here, full sheep set if you want it.
---
That’s the tactical version
---
Not just you.
---
Nice sniper rifle by the way. I'm on PS4 I meant to say..
---
Even if you manage to get a three Star item, there's a high chance it's junk.
---
How starting new
---
Deathwing.
---
For reference I'm 113. The boss rips through my power armor and shreds me in one, two hits max. You're not going to be much help! Good luck though.
---
Just started today myself, having a great time on Xbox also. Maybe I'll see you around!
---
Give it time, it will eventually find a way after a few patches and new bugs I bet lol.
---
I know I'm not gonna be much help, that's not the point though. I want to experience the fight and others want the loot. Idc if I die 50 times I still want to be there when it happens and I still wanna pop a couple shots in lol
---
I use perk loadout manager and I am level 270+, I can switch my perk cards on the go from out of PA to PA perks, utility perk cards etc whenever and wherever. Takes me less than 5 seconds to switch my perks for a totally different build. I run with 15 str, so I can use melee, shotgun or heavy. I only use the shotgun to cripple her wings when she lands. You don't need to have shotgun perks, just enforcer and a vats crit to her wings with concentrated fire. 
---
I would run with 2 PA builds for queen, one with enforcer and heavy weapon perks, my bloodied explosive gatling does 370+dmg her hit without heavy perks, so with all 9 perks on it does 500 per hit. When she lands I swap to my melee perk cards, and I over 1000damage per swing. Run with incisor and martial artist too.
---
Time and money are totally different things and your entire argument hinges on them being the same
---
No where was it ever posted that 3 star enemies drop only 3 stars. They just have a higher chane to drop better starred gear. I have almost all 3 star armor and weapons and most of them I got from just random non 3 star legendaries. I know people hate hearing this but RNG is just that random. Some people get lucky, others don't. Whining doesn't change much.
---
Now when it comes to event bosses, I do feel like they should, at the very least, award a 2 star with the chance at a 3 star.
---
All that's going to happen if they get killed like you are suggesting is people getting pissed that the event is "broken" and obviously singling out their build, by killing them over and over again.
---
Make that 2 - it prevents constant rerolling, and having 5 of the same type is very rare, since packs stop at level 50.
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f4548c8&amp;d=ss2sg2se2p00pd0pk0pp0e82eu0el0ib4ir2a72a12a02a32l71lt2lu2c72sn2s42&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=
---
This is my build when I run queens. I run with emergency protocols on power armor.
---
Which one do you recommend?
---
Because you perhaps use a level 5 card for build A, and build B has only room for a level 2.
---
Lmk if you’re able to get the event on your server and I’ll join
---
In the data files, some mods appear to directly affect AP cost, rather than through weight. Reflex sights seem to reduce AP cost, armor piercing and high-cap mags increase it, for example.
---
Can't be sure that any of these values are actually applied though.
---
You get 2 more from the side quests. I also would love to know where the others come from
---
Maybe fix your punctuation first? lol
---
The 3 hour cooldown is a little ridiculous. I get that they put it on the same cooldown timer as a nuke, but come on. It only has 1 start location and doesnt last nearly as long as a nuke with anywhere close to the same rewards. Honestly the cooldown should be an hour at most.
---
Well, good luck. I've had the event fail several times because people couldn't do enough damage. Not sure if it's like a particular boss late game, most likely not, but for that it gets harder the more people--meaning you need to be able to help.
---
Add me gt: v0rdul
---
We can help each other out
---
I can always use the help
---
I’ll have to check when I get back to my machine
---
If you want farm legendaries, you server hop at west-tek, because there is not egouth legendary spawns.
---
If you want to do new event cyptid, you must server hop.
---
If you are farming SBQ you must server hop after 3nukes.
---
And there are lot more reasons to server hop. Hopefuly they add legendary spawn in every house, atleast 50+ level. And change Cooldown for some events.
---
Not new. Sometimes mobs get confused about what they are.
---
Don't like the cost vs rewards, don't do it. Simple.
---
Go upstairs in taxidermy. Check the big board theres sheets of paper to read on the wall. These are quests. Got 2 s plans so far with 1 quest left.
---
Yeah, I'm in a similar boat man. Stability keeps getting worse for me, not better.
---
Huh, I've never noticed before. That's what I get for always playing at 2 AM I guess
---
Can you want 8hours till i leave work ? :D :D :D
---
Honestly it seems like I'll have too lol
---
Jesus Fucking Christ this is at least half a dozen threads on this subject today alone.
---
When did server hopping become a horrible taboo or something that is so GRUELING to do that people have to be this upset about it?
---
The event isn't rare, While server hopping for completely different things I completed it three times today, once for the challenge and twice more for photo ops, failed it two more times due to low timers and I've seen it active and ignored it at least another three times.
---
Fireflies neither spawn ONLY with that event nor are they purely rare random spawns.  A simple search here for "fireflies" would bring you straight to a helpful post directing you straight to a location with at least 8+ guaranteed spawns.
---
Up until yesterday with that god awful rad storm challenge that broke peoples fucking minds the worst you'd usually see would be some ridiculous task to craft a stupid number of beers but aside from those they have almost always been total pushovers that you could complete without even having known it was even a challenge in the first place.
---
The main power box near the fusion core maker doesn't work for me most of the time so I connect it to 1 of the 2 the conduits between core maker and suply box
---
Yeah....I read a sub where it was mentioned that pa mods are broken right now. Only pa plans work at the moment
---
What I find even more frustrating, is that all these advanced recipes are horseshit - you spend many rare ressources for a minor buff. If you eat/drink the ingredients separately, you get more out of it, so why even bother spending hunge amounts of time hunting for spices and plants? 
---
But I think brewed drinks have better buffs, so maybe me gripe doesn't apply there as much.
---
No idea where to get the other plans, considering there are 43 of them. I got the few from the side quests but would love to know where the other plans are to be gotten. Sorry I’m of no help but hope someone can help us both out.
---
The boxes work...sometimes.  Sometimes they just won’t work even though I’ve powered it up.  But sometimes they do.  Also, I’ve found that if the Fusion core generator is already wired up, I have to delete the wire, activate the box, then rewire it to work.
---
It is, because you don't have 40% damage reduction from assasins legendary effect and 75% from sentinel too. So you are basicaly in something with rezistances that are reduced by huge % with perks. 
---
When i see guy in PA on survival i don't wait and shoot.
---
DR is nowhere near as important as %based mitigation is.  300 resists and the mitigation perks is strong enough to tank anything in the game.  Can even tank the event boss currently out with tons of people there if you block and slam aid (which you normally don't have to do).
---
If you're not running % based mitigation, DR will never be high enough to really make you tanky because of how damage is calculated.  You'll be fine for 99% of the stuff in this way-too-easy game, until you run into another player or an encounter boss that 1-shots you.
---
So it's cool for content to not be worth playing then? Nice logic
---
It wont be lore friendly if the pictures don’t turn out black and white
---
Thank you
---
Were the half a dozen other threads crying about today's challenges today not good enough for you?
---
Server hopping is not some grueling or daunting task.  Just while hopping for entirely different shit I've completed the enlightenment event three times today, failed it twice and seen it active at least another four times when I even happened to be looking in  that area.
---
Get 5/5 hunter gear for new animal boss coming next week!!
---
How can you interact with it?
---
I killed everyone once like 2 weeks ago, the reward was really disappointing
---
If I had kept all of the hunter’s armor I’ve dropped from this character I’d probably have four complete sets.
---
The “best” fights I’ve seen have people there just for the queen and people there just to keep the adds off the queen killers. If those lowbies can just draw aggro from the mobs so I can run in and punch her right in the baby bump for mad bloodied damage then I’m happy to have them there. Sadly, getting 10+ people to work as a team is like herding kittens.
---
I understand that, but sometimes the duplicates don't make any sense. I just got a duplicate scrapper perk card which is just a level 1 card. It's totally worthless.
---
All the suits I’ve seen were level 50. What the hell.
---
Non 3 star legendaries don't drop 3 star items. And "Whining" changes a lot, that's kind of why they want our feedback. Nowhere have I seen that they have a "higher" chance of dropping a 3 star item, we've never gotten much info on the legendary system. It's the simple fact that killing end game enemies give auto stim chest pieces and cloaking wood pieces that are just useless. At this point there's no reason to kill a 3 star if im just going to get the same result as if I killed a 1 star enemy.
---
No.   Plenty of people do it, so its worth playing for them.  People *Sometimes* play games because they are fun, not because they expect something back.   If the reward for doing the event is not good for the effort you put into it, don't do it.  Simple.
---
The turrets have always been a help but never a super murderer thing in the Fallout world, even though the ceiling turrets in military installations comes close. I don't think Bethesda should change the history of turrets.
---
Appart from that, the turrets are supposed to help you as a player, not replace you as defender.
---
I never saw a button for placing/equipping the PA on xbox, I only saw press x to drop so I assumed that’s how it was done.  I noticed that the collect option disappeared after dropping and I figured people could then take it, so I always made sure no one was around and that I jumped in right after dropping it.  This was my first PA skin so I’ve never gotten the “destroy” message and it freaked me out lol.  Thanks for the clarification.
---
Same issues since patch 8 got worse with most recent patch. Xb1.
---
But how will Bethesda charge you for it. Oh right Atoms
---
The only "proof" I can offer is tons of reddit posts that claim they killed the SBQ solo with 1800 shells, but soon as people come, then it takes over 8000 shells and much longer.   They do not claim the fight lags.
---
It only gets annoying when a ghoul thinks it's a robot and explodes when you loot it
---
“Ye that’s gonna be 600 right there bucko”
---
Good ol Godd Howard
---
Thanks for clearing this up for me!
---
That's intriguing to hear.
---
Always like the harness would be cool to wear it as an outfit.
---
Played just now, installs and mods we're fine but glitchy. Weapon Repair required pressing y then x (I believe) due to new prompt "workshop repair". Screen was blank on left side showing weapons list.
---
I already did all challenges that was not bugged. You get around 8k atoms from them. Then you have only daily and weekly ones, so if you want atoms you must do them. It was good until that alcoholic DLC, now there are realy crazy dailyes. Like kill some specific mob in radstom. I had 3radstorms in 500hours of playing.
---
/u/scorpio989 any luck with your recording?
---
Same. And it's not that dificult. If you do the mechanic the boss is just a piñata that can be killed in little time. Is not the game fault if people don't bother to doo the mechanics.
---
This is just a concept image, Bethesda needs to implement it themselves. :/
---
I havent done that event yet (probably tomorrows) bit I wonder where on a way You spend 2k caps? Is it q requirement?
---
You could make it in 21 hours previously as well. It’s always been 1400 per day.
---
No, you can't use Biv's or anybody else's fermenter.  You have to use your own @ camp because it acts as a small stash box for alcohol
---
Or some kind of trade system. Lets say 3 for one of your choice.
---
I can't help but have the same feeling sometimes.  I find it extra disheartening that this ramp up in challenge difficulty is coinciding with a point where I have pretty much run out of career challenges to complete.  I want to believe that Bethesda wants 76 to be a fun game and that these road-bumps are their growing pains as they figure out what works and doesn't work.  It's just that when they change things that (from a player perspective) are already working pretty well they lose players along the way.
---
So basically what you're saying is, it's not all about damage resistance. It's about perks and other things that reduce the percentage of damage given like lone Wanderer and blocker?
---
I'll take the TSE minigun for your price, 1.5k
---
press e and it'll create a huge explosion.
---
I would rather get my own wood rather than people at other guys wood, thanks though!
---
So, try seeing if you can build it at your camp. If you can, then perhaps it somehow pushed you through the quest.  Either way, it wasn't anything special &amp; now you'll  be able to make booze
---
First frame was at Grafton Dam.
---
Now I carry about 15 frames of various assorted armors, to show off my paints.
---
Bethesda is located In Rockville Maryland in the Eastern part of the US hence the use of EDT in all of their posts about maintenance. 
---
California is located in the Western part of of the US and would be PDT
---
EDT is Eastern Daylight Time 
---
PDT is Pacific Daylight Time
---
So if it's 10am EDT that would be 7am PDT
---
Sidenote 10am EDT would be 2pm GMT/UTC
---
I don’t have the plans to make the fermenter or brewing station, so I can’t build one at my camp. That’s why I need the quest to activate again.
---
I absolutely am! Posted about it separately here

---
Me and my buddy were talking about this and after trying to kill sentinel players with anti armor+ stabilized+ pa, we came to the conclusion that AA only affects the Dr of the armor they are wearing and has nothing to do with the legendary effects of the armor(assassin's, sentinel, caviler, etc).
---
its becuase you have it painted with the atom skin, you need to take the paint off first then can you drop it with out having to destroy it.
---
There are sadly not, would be pretty cool though. Thinking of night vision legendary effects..
---
&gt; crying about today's challenges
---
A guess criticism is not a word you're familiar with, and it's constructive criticism.
---
&gt; I've completed the enlightenment event three times today, failed it twice and seen it active at least another four times when I even happened to be looking in that area.
---
It took me about 45 minutes of server hoping to finally get it to spawn. I'm also calling bullshit for seeing that event 7 times in one session of playing.
---
So the turret towers do spring up around the backdoor of the club.  They are a menace.  Players wont be able to do a thing about them once that happens.  Rockets will be flying inside the clubhouse all day and exploding everywhere causing players to not get legendaries, loose corpses, and lag out other players.
---
I'm so sorry but that actually sounds friggin hilarious, I can imagine how it would be annoying though
---
Yeah. There's only so far you can remove the challenge when you start making things worse.
---
Regarding that shopping mall vendor, I think there is actually a bot in WS called BoS vendor already, iirc
---
Yeah it was fun first time, but then when you finaly get to another event and people are just running around in chaos, is not much fun anymore, trying hard 10minutes to fail, because of nonsense damage every object in that area doing.
---
Still don’t understand why they aren’t a thing.
---
I might be able to help you, My gamer tag is Thatonenerd776
---
I’m gonna be at work atleast the next two days, so I’ll message you when we can team up if ya want. I’m level 72 and I could probably craft you some stuff too if ya want
---
That's...part of the main quest.
---
You're not going to do great with this line of questioning here...the vast majority of 76's audience never played the non-bethesda games...some never played 3 or new vegas. A few probably never played 4.
---
There are plenty of guides and mechanics you can use to make this much easier event.
---
Hack the robots, use tanking perks to mitigate the damage, have the low level players kill the exploding heads.
---
This is a group event that needs group attention and not bunch of solo players trying to solo it at same time.
---
Done the event three times and killed the boss three times.
---
Sure I died on the first attempt a lot, but I learned from it. Did you?
---
It wouldnt be as bad if the bodies didn't go on a space adventure when it happens though.
---
This is my strategy too.  I basically show up all rad poisoned, pray someone else in PA or high resist is willing to conduit...and I go in swinging with bloody power fist.  I can take a good 5-15% of his life per hit depending on rads/life/chems.  
---
As min/max bloody melee, conduit is just a bad role in the event.  Still will do it if nobody else will, and just spam stims.
---
Delicious robomeat, though the metal shavings always cut up my throat

thank you for the help

*rips bolt out of arm*
---
**AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!**
---
For how long?
---
I saw rifle gaming make a video about it, but havnt watched it as I dont really enjoy his commentary as much as others. Ill edit a link once I find it
---
Not for me. I had 18 charisma and hard bargain 3 on and it costed 1950.
---
I have over 300 hours into the game.
---
So your proposing to make legendary even more trivial? 99% of them are not useless.   I can go to whitesprings and get 10 drops easily.  2 out of them would definitely have a use.  Anti-Robot shotgun, or a Medics Pistol.  Both of those definitely have uses.   Shotgun could be equipped for just doing the silo runs and would be far more effective than my crafted handmade.  Medics pistol would be light enough to carry around to group with friends for a bit of healing because my stealth-crit build would actually proc that pistol quite a bit.
---
No those are not 1 shot kill god tier weapons, but its a far cry to being "useless".  
---
Many people call the wood legendaries "useless" but they are some of the best armor in game for stealth builds.
---
Similar experience here except I'll admit that it generally took me a good bit longer to complete because I like to play at a casual pace.    
---
I think the point at which it stopped being enjoyable for me is when it began to require server hopping (find a certain type of random creature) or character changing (brew more things than there are easily obtainable ingredients).  I generally had no guilt with skipping a 10 point daily if it was annoying because I tended to complete all of the weekly challenges (usually within the first couple days).  Lately, it seems like there may only be one or two dailies that I am interested in doing and an increasing amount of weekly ones that I won't complete since I have no interest in pvp.  It's a sad feeling because I can feel myself beginning to fall out of love with this game.
---
It's more about reducing damage by a % than it is a high DR.  The damage you take is part of an annoying formula that compares the damage to be dealt (how much damage the enemy does per hit) vs. the appropriate damage resistance AFTER it's reduced by whatever the % is.
---
A very quick and not all-encompassing example.
---
Enemy does 10 damage.  You have 2 DR, and 50% mitigation.  You take 3 damage.
---
Enemy does 10, but now you have 4 dr, and 10% mitigation.  You take 5 damage.
---
This is leaving out a few things, but that's the overall jist.  Look up the fallout 4 article on how damage is calculated if you want to know more - and since we can't console into this game, its all an assumption - but there's no reason to think after lots of play that its significantly different in PVE.
---
PVP it is definitely not accurate for, as even with 95% melee mitigation, I both hit, and get hit once and kill any player regardless of what they have on or are using.  PVP is fucking broken.
---
The Sprint perk does not work on pa at all actually
---
Well then my 18 charisma with hard bargain 3 is magically better than yours. I bought the card less than an hour ago for 1760. Last night I commented to my 4 man squad we could do it for 440 caps each per run, and it was a clean little number to divide by 4.
---
PC here.  Friend of PS4 also has it.  Ugh :(
---
The whole perk system should be thought again.
---
There are too many mandatory QoL perks.
---
Having 3-point perk card you are then not able to use it as 1-point card.
---
Endurance is almost useless in perk cards.
---
The perk management is missing packs for faster switching.
---
There are simply too many different perk cards for too few SPECIAL points. Many of current cards could be switched to be passive (as they have been suggested by so many posts here), without affecting the game play.
---
Thanks for encounter!
---
Got my automatic mod for Tesla, and when I try to attach this I only hear „click” but nothing happened, mod still in inventory...
---
[Delicious](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/finally-some-good-fucking-food)
---
For instance: A 100+ player basically wiped 10 ghouls, with their Automatic rifle (+ explosive) and had a low HP (forget perk, anyone tell me?).
---
My usual response is to get them to accidentally hit me, and shiv them with my meth knife.
---
Single Action, being it's a big caliber and high stopping power for game
---
or how about a 'deck' where you can store cards you use, and only have the ones you swap left on the table.
---
Can't mod weapons on ps4. My fusion cores aren't running out again either. Been at 1% on current one since lying lowe started.
---
That’s what I was feeling. In my head I thought 10mm, western, or .44 for the reload speed. As the crossbow can a sec to do its thing.
---
You're not wrong.  The sad thing is that plenty of us would have no problem with buying Atoms if there were cool and well-valued things to buy.  There are a handful of great new things that are a decent value but the majority of items have been either over-priced, uninteresting (yeah, personal opinion) or recycled from FO4.
---
Thank you for help out!
---
At least it's the entire trilogy
---
+karma
---
No problem. Here is a 3* junkie wooden leg armor. All good?
---
This is the best, AAA-studio-post-apocalyptic-drunken-syphilitic simulator money can buy.
---
Most people don't spend money on atoms 🤷‍♂️
---
Yes! It should be a nod to the Labyrinth (1986) bag lady.
---
Like made out of junk? If so, you could have a small little net in the back that could (visually) hold junk like an alarm clock, radio, part of a lawn flamingo, a stop sign, and some medium length wood scraps (that would look like they were ripped off a tree).
---
The rad ants was the beginning of the end for me because I've never been able to do it without multiple server hops.  Looking at load screen after load screen drives down my enjoyment in a hurry and it can't be all that great for server stability either.
---
Prototype x01 =x01 it’s the same
---
lol...I just commented this same idea, scrolled down and here it is from you. take an upvote.
---
i play a rifleman build and when i crafted a lvl 50 and upgraded it i get 90 dmg, so i think its a pretty decent stealth weapon
---
Wow I don't know what to say but it looks like you really pissed off someone. Ouch
---
  I to found the interconnected network digital finger word anecdote humorous.
---
I will check it out brother
---
Bloodied. 
---
In adventure people mostly use pacifist mode, so if someone really trigger pvp with you, he deserve to die.
---
Why you need kill those creatures anyway? Even legendaries aren't worth for troubles with curent loot tables.
---
Also if you are doing even or something, you can get with randoms in group, so everyone get loot.
---
Probably western, still has the hunting look and more stopping power than .44 but the reload is so much better. I really like the idea though, it's very cool!
---
In this context, they’re *exactly* the same, and yes, that’s precisely my argument. Two scarce currencies of which some people have more than others for reasons entirely external to the game.
---
Full Charge, in Str. Rank 1: Sprinting in power armor reduces fusion core drain by half. Rank 2 consumes no fusion core power.
---
I can only hope that the next 6mos - year will bring those improvements.  One thing We can always count on is that Bethesda LOVES our money.  So if they know what’s good for them they’ll follow ESO approach and add some neat stuff
---
Now we got dailies for events that NEVER HAPPEN. I been playing on same server for several hours today and Path to Enlightenment never triggered. Same issue with the previous one. Also so much for leveling up once, now they want 3 a day.
---
They should blanket nerf PvE ER in the meantime at least to make energy weapons feel somewhat viable.
---
Ive been looking to start playing again, but are there no perks for improving disease resistance?
---
Also it would be cool if they added an immunity type feature like every time you catch a disease, the chance of contracting it again goes down a small tiny percentage
---
You dont need to create a filter. The game simply needs to create unique hashes from photo files it had generated in game and store them in its server side  db, to ensure that only game taken images are uploaded. 
---
If Bethesda’s really paranoid they can do iterative hashing using scrypt or bcrypt. Not easy, but certainly not bleeding edge stuff. Hashes are a common tool for experienced devs.
---
Word is they'll fix this next update
---
I guess somehow it IS magically better because I just checked again.
---
Yes of course I understand completely.
---
`KILL CODE CONFIRMED, ACQUIRING TARGET`
---
Haven't got my sneak all the way up yet (pvp build) but you could always one shot them with a bloodied dragon and chems. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nawu9WO6z4k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nawu9WO6z4k)
---
I'm sure you could shoot down the 80 too. Bloodied is awesome with stealth, well once all the perks are right.
---
X01 has better rad resist and ultracite has better ballistic resist I believe
---
Vender bot resin at top of the world.
---
Theses so many enemies in the various nearby cabins, I can make a scavenging run, sell everything, then dick around for 5 mins before they all respawn. Plus I like his dialogue compared to train station vendors
---
Yea, especially with how atoms are thrown around like candy for a new account. Within a few days you have around 1,000 to 1,500 atoms as there's a challenge for every little thing you do early on. Basically "Don't die for 30 seconds", here's 80 atoms.
---
Maybe they will solve that problem in the third quest line with the legendary character system
---
Fireproof card is wonderful against scorchbeasts. If you add dense mod on your armor, their screech almost don't hurt you. After level 50, with a good build you can beat them regularly.
---
You do good work. It’s worthy of rewards and I love the scribe hat.
---
On survival you can be oneshoted mostly only with fatman. Way worse are explosive automatic guns that staggers you, because they don't even need to hit you and you will lose control of your character.
---
I’ll track one of each for comparison. But western or single action will probably be the go to.
---
Randy? Are you whoring yourself out for cheeseburgers again?
---
RIP, had an AAE western but I traded it earlier, I'm Xbox tho idk which you are
---
If you don’t put limits on the feature then yes, it’ll break the system. The key is finding the sweet spot. Bethesda doesnt need to store any of your images. Your camp is not present when you’re not logged in, right? So the photos only need to be uploaded to the server WHEN you log in (and deleted when you log out). 
---
But that still occupies bandwidth, you say. Sure, that’s why you put limits. Put only a 5 “frame” limit per camp. And the images, put a cap on the size and the quality BEFORE transfer. 1mb for every photo is pretty generous. We’re not talking about RAW files. 
---
5 images x 24 users per server instance = 120mb at most. That’s your ceiling. I mean, it’s 120mb, surely the servers can handle that both in memory storage AND bandwidth. That’s also 100 or so mb downstream to your box, assuming you visit everybody’s camp on that server. Should be manageable, right? 
---
There’s practical ways to do this, Bethesda just has to want it.
---
Oof I saw a buddyget practically the same thing in that area, instead of wendigos it was fog crawlers and the all the SBs and scorched.
---
Once more for the people in the cheap seats. You need hard bargain 3, but something screwy is at work.
---
Fallout 76 sheepsquatch key card https://imgur.com/a/kfPubc9
---
The RAD storm challenge was another I hated and didn't see the point in. 
---
I did say in the post it wasn't just today's that had irked me, and that is been getting worse for awhile. 
---
The Beer Daily for Craft 50 Drinks was a nightmare, why 50? You can go to a set location, get all the stuff for 100 beers and sit for half an hour crafting them, button mashing, but that's not really content. 
---
The challenges should be something worth doing, like Kill a Scorched Beast or Deathclaw, not kill a Deathclaw while on Chems and naked.
---
Xbox. Just hit level 21
---
I was server hoping yesteday for 2hours, got only to 2events, that failed. It is better to do it with friends and buy that card. (if you have friends, mine stoped playing few patches ago)
---
Wish mine was that cheap. Without hard bargain mine costs 2500
---
You should join the fallout Instagram community! It’s much easier to share pictures and appreciate others.
---
Im not sure how to so it but you may need to submit a ticket to Bethesda, it might not help but it's worth letting them know.
---
The event has a cool down of 3 hours. You will have to wait or hop servers to find one that hasn't already been used
---
Cool. Thanks!
---
I saw a post: "Level 27, I finished the game"
---
What? At level 27 I was arguing with the mole miners in the Ash Heap! I like to explore but I don't know how you can do some quest (alone?) in high level area
---
I've killed lots of Flatwoods monsters, they used to spawn outside my CAMP all the time. I looked at them very closely numerous times, and I still think they look much more robotic than any previous iteration of Zetan. 
---
 And every picture I've seen of Mothman from IRL lore doesn't look anything like what we have in game, so..
---
Agree to disagree I guess.
---
Just confirmed with my homie &amp; he says it should just automatically appear in your camp items. From what I remember,  I believe he's right
---
You took the bait
---
The camera should also make physical pictures like notes we can hide in places or trade. :&gt;
---
We did SBQ which drop ultracite plans like 100 times with huge group of people. None had it. There is no ultracite jetpack in game probably.
---
You can get plans for T-45, T-51b and T-60 from vendors tho. And X-01 can be bought as mod, very rare at enclave vendor.
---
I just hate getting diseased from hitting something with my melee weapon with a sneak attack. :/
---
It doesn't help but the fermenter isn't needed for fermentable drinks to age, it just speeds the aging process up.
---
The drinks will have a CND bar, when that goes down they will change to say vintage nukashine or from fermentable beer to just beer.
---
&gt; The turrets have always been a help but never a super murderer thing in the Fallout world
---
Super murdering weapons  did not exist at all in the Fallout World before this game in any form.  So that observation is completely irrelevant.   
---
Super murdering weapons are indeed a part of this game and are often held by those attacking workshops, so turrets should be capable of countering them.
---
Excavator has the DR of a wet paper towel
---
T-51b higgest balistic damage rezistances .... X-01higgest energy rezistances ... Ultracite best compromis
---
Because there are cosmetic hats.
---
They’re a good way to increase iron into your diet 😂
---
I am very sorry but Bethesda has not released hot pink power armor—or any other ultra cute power armor—at this time.
---
Thats why i thought haha
---
Actually, this would be nice having for any level. If they could do it for specific quests too, that would be nice. When joining a group, they put everyone in that group on the same server.
---
The game shouldn't be about server hopping. The game should be playable with out server hopping.
---
The fact is that BGS dropped the ball big time in the server hopping. They should have made it impossible to server hop and made a game where that was not needed.
---
Why is it that people defend a poor design and idiotic actions that need you to server hop to finish events/challenges/gather items.
---
Thanks for the clarification, just thought it was worth double checking
---
Vendors daily 1400 per characters. Farming events. Cap stash route from youtube. Trading with players.
---
Oh ok thanks
---
And have you tested dr on wet paper towel before 😉
---
You know what I fucking meant
---
His nuke zone videos are pretty helpful if you ever want to know what happens in a given area.
---
Hey I appreciate that, thank you!
---
I know that. But they could have easily made two sets of hats. One cosmetic with a different name and the ones they could have been worn. Sure more items and work but people would like the option.
---
Prototype X-01 is the standard X-01 but when you craft it, it has the prototype paint job applied for free. Craft it and modifying it is the only way aside from trading with players to get X-01.
---
Crossing my fingers for a *** Deathclaw boss as well!
---
That is absolutely terrifying.
---
True.  But I am somewhat drunk and therefore cannot stop myself from responding inappropriately.
---
Then don’t respond
---
There was so much thing that bethesda could easily made. haha.
---
Ah, yeah is this a second build or alt character?
---
I hate to say this but the Quake School of Jumping helped me out when the thing was chasing me. All I had to do was jump, move a small distance and jump back. It had a hard time hitting me but kept it from running around.
---
I do have the Marsupial Gene.
---
Now I want to concept a power armor like the cursed Berserker armor...
---
Take every weapon you can find and sell them. Easy money.
---
Likewise!  Hoping for Deathclaws to become more deadlier in the future!
---
I mean I would mine but the guy I called that used equally offense words towards me lol and as far as I'm aware he wasn't banned
---
I'll add on top of this that if the crafting items made 3-5 key cards, it would make it worth so much more.
---
He does. I do. Everyone understood.
---
You want hover around looking fabulous.

White springs has been nerfed to hell, down to the smallest detail.  By that I mean they didn't just nerf legendaries, but things like materials for flux farming too. It used to be that you could loot meat piles for hardened mass and high radiation fluids even if you did not tag the ghouls. That doesn't seem to be the case now.  And there are way less ghouls there to kill so you can harvest those materials needed to craft stabilized flux.
---
You ain’t lying.
---
Just an alt.
---
I have a fresh server. Ready for event. Psn is tuchflufygetdizy
---
Him and his ultra cute armor.
---
Damn tease is what it is
---
That’s just sad, s was used to be perfect for stable flux but now takes too long to kill and whole server doesn’t join in like it used to.
---
Still tho, lemme know how it turns out :)
---
I've been on kind of a hot streak lately, but my poor friend got nothing but one star stuff today.  Between a four person team all over the map sharing hits on \*\*\* enemies, we must have killed a dozen or more.  She just kept rolling one star rocks and twigs.  The "Wooden Leg" has become what we call any undesirable item.
---
"What did you get?"
---
"Another wooden leg...."
---
I think the worst is when you kill a three-star, see "anti-armor handmade", get super excited and it's only one star.  Still a great gun, but kind of a let down when it had the potential to be a god roll piece.
---
Still would be nice to build one at my camp though :)
---
Keep the TSE handmade.  It is far better than any outfit.
---
Will do
---
Be glad you aren't on survival, because you wouldn't done defending. Cause i would fast travel on that event and murder you. Haha.
---
Whenever that happened to me at lower level I'd run until I found somewhere to hide. If it had Scorched followers I'd kill them, and just wait. Eventually it'd get bored, find something else to attack and go away.
---
İt is prequel
---
Yeah see the above comment for  the results
---
So would you prefer someone snatching all of the monsters without letting atleast tag?
---
Also randoms don't tend to group up. Most invites go unanswered, so it ain't like I'm not trying
---
&gt; No where was it ever posted that 3 star enemies drop only 3 stars.  
---
What sense does it make for zero star legendary enemies to drop one star loot and for three star enemies to do the same?   If Bethesda wants three star loot to be rare, they could simply have fewer three star enemies.   But having zero star and three star enemies drop the exact same kinds of loot is just idiotic.
---
Same, on PC. Also have been unable to select an item to edit it or remove it. Exiting build mode didn't even fix it I had to relog.
---
Support the game and buy some
---
I wish we could just go back to Vault 76 and use an Auto Doc
---
Yeah my point was you can't learn the shotgun mod, so it is now unattainable for me.
---
Every fallout game takes place in different area so it isn't really chronological. But  [Here you have shown in which year which game take place.](https://images.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb1554970756684/fallout/images/timeline/ecea66d6e2216656d9ef92a5d89f7318.png)
---
Still got a fedora
---
You can tell the chronology by looking at your pip boy, but it’s goes:
---
Fallout 76  
---
Fallout 1  
---
Fallout 2  
---
Fallout 3  
---
Fallout 4
---
There are some spin offs in there, and 76 will be classed by many as a spin off, which would explain the discrepancy in what you’ve heard. Whilst it does take place before all the other games, it doesn’t necessarily tie in.
---
Why the troll answer was that really a sensible reply to my post smh
---
LOL.  Friend request accepted.  Hope to catch you soon!
---
And next you're going to try and tell me that non legendary enemies don't drop legendaries either. We've all seen this happen. Just because you've never got anything past a 1 star gear off a 1 star enemy doesn't mean it hasn't happened. 
---
I actually haven't gotten many auto stim or wood armors either btw.
---
Whining helps nothing. Constructive feedback does. There's a huge difference. Whining makes a game change like how Destiny does, and honestly I don't want to see that happen here, I'd rather us all give our unbiased opinions and feedback instead of acting like children because we didn't get our instant gratification. I hunted down legendaries for my gear, and I'm actually pretty satisfied with it for the most part. It wasn't easy or quick and I don't expect it to be. Pretty sure we all got crappy legendaries in FO4 too. I still remember my first Freezing Rolling Pin. It happens. Buck up and keep trying.
---
Privacy. Wanted posters and stalking may already be a fo76 thing with the signs and the letters spelling words on peoples camp walls. But the naked ghouls masterpiece framed and mounted is classy https://i.imgur.com/ONX4OPq.jpg
---
I got it a few minutes ago after reading this. I'd say it was try #12. 
---
Enemies that spawn on the defending position of the swamp with ranged attacks don't like to move outside, happened with a Super Mutant with a laser rifle (9th try) and based on one the replies on the thread.
---
Enemies that spawn on the attacking position can chase you to the fissure but be careful because they will leash back at a certain point.
---
I am just telling you to take positive, that you was able to defend it. So you did get some plans and other reward.
---
You could be right about flatwoods I've just seen a few other suggest its a zetan. And as I have no other info about it you could be right.
---
As for Mothman, if you look at the Mothman statue in game vs the statue in point pleasant irl they bear a striking resemblance to each other.
---
I just think they based the Mothman's in-game mob appearance off of several of the real-life stories and skeptics saying that all everyone was seeing is the Virginian owl or an Albino owl (hence the red eyes).
---
If you look up images of Mothman, besides a few key details such as a man with large wings spanning ten feet or deep red and reflecting birdlike eyes. Most images from early reports on mothman vary wildly from one another.
---
I just logged into Reddit to say this very thing. 
---
It would make CAMPs more personalised and individual. 
---
👍🏻👏🏻
---
Move elsewhere.  There are other good spots around the map.
---
Apparently the recipe for the sandwich he talks about actually exists in game
---
Depends on situation. If i see legendary that i could oneshot i swap for weapon, that only tag him. Other mobs i kill or avoid. If legendary is under 50 level i don't even care about him.
---
If i am somewhere to farm and there are another people i server hop.
---
I can't either.  It sucks.
---
Yeah, I get you. Idk if it'll work but you could try teaming up with someone who hasn't done it and as they progress maybe it'll progress you?
---
I'm just taking shots in the dark though.
---
Sorry i can't be of more help 😞
---
Doubt it, I'm pretty sure it's just a carry over from Fallout 4
---
Of course they don't, they want you to buy Atoms. Which is really unfortunate, but is the only way for me to explain to myself why they want me to do the exact same shit day after day and week after week. After the 5th "Drink 50 boozes", I was like wtf no.
---
Honestly I wish they would've made these a rare drop on the respective head. The feeling of killing a scorchbeast only to be able to learn how to mount it's head would be great. Though going around killing cats and dogs just to mount them might be a little harsh it'd still make for an interesting idea.
---
But how will we craft it without gorilla parts?
---
My post was not about defending a workshop if you read it you will see it's about Bethesda needing to rethink how they effect the game when they shut down a server and they should give you back that workshop on another server of if it's not free then at least compensate you with some of that resource you was collecting
---
Roleplay wise this would be amazing. I'd love to have a picture of my character and his in game husband together.
---
I disagree with this completely but I can understand from a point of view that doesn’t have good gear for pvp
---
All the heads are made with the same parts
---
So you dont need anything specific
---
Compensation for what? I could use the Contractor perk and build fusion gen, 15 turrets and 4 extractors and it would still spend just the workshop resources.
---
Easier said than done. 
---
Guess F:76 isn't for new players
---
Thats why I do bare minimum when I set up shops now, not worth setting up or powering up a plant when you can just set a fusion generator up and farm what you need... time is money, so unless you plan on investing in a few shops that are all connected to the same power station.. even then it's not worth the risk/reward unless you can maintain them all for a while
---
Really? Dang. I didnt know that.
---
You never had to fight over food with your siblings? You eat as fast and as much. Or in this case kill as fast and as much.
---
What can I say - I love having caps!
---
If you are talking about maintenance, it was anounced one day before, exact time when it will start. If you are talking about servers going off sometimes, well that happens. 
---
What you want, 25k caps when server go down?
---
If you mean the no star ghouls that you farm in whitesprings yeah, they have a chance at dropping 1 star legendaries. But I've never in my 400+ hours of playing this game come across a 1 star legendary that's given 3 stars lmao. I'm not the only person who feels 3 star enemies should give what they present to be. I'd be fine with a 2 star dropping from them, but a one star is ridiculous. If you want to continue to get 1 star legendaries from SBQs and such i mean more power to you. But I play this game a lot and would rather not waste caps or a nuke to summon an end game boss and get trash.
---
So you enjoy wasting your time powering up a power station to run the resource extractor just to loose it
---
I'm not on about the materials to build things but the amount of time and ammunition you use up just to end up with nothing after except for some useless resources and plans you have already
---
You're telling me it looks like a Zetan and you haven't even seen it in game yet? I've seen numerous posts on Reddit saying that, but if you actually LOOK at it in game it does not look like any Zetan in any of the other Fallout games. 
---
I agree that the statues look very much alike, but when you see an actual Mothman in game, it's a giant moth with glowing red eyes. It doesn't look like the statue at all, except like the eyes. Which is what makes me think it's just another experiment gone wrong.
---
Its what I do too, typically I just tag enemies when I can with others. Doesn't work with the people clearing house
---
I agree, reduce the likelihood of 3 star enemies if they wanted them to be super rare drops.
---
We're left begging for missing, simple features that were present in every 3D Fallout game... This is sad.
---
An upgraded Overseers guardian is pretty much a super murdering weapon and just about every legendary effect in FO76 were in FO4. It's probably just that you have never stood at the other end that makes you feel that way.
---
So what you're telling me is . . .
---
*I should kill them and steal all the drugs!*
---
You're doing an incredible work dear, I really appreciate it.
---
Read my post again I said nothing about caps I said they should give you some of that resource you was making
---
And they dont tell you what server is going to be switched off when you join them
---
There was a fallout 4 mod that would show armor over outfits. It actually worked pretty well. It just strange that a random modder can get it to work but they don't implement it.
---
Scorchbeasts get easier after you get more powerful and get a good handle on their tactics.  The cloud attack is really linear and not too difficult to avoid in open areas.  (I can see how it would be ultra annoying inside a building while trying to read notes and terminals.  
---
Most of the time the scorchbeast has an entourage of 5-6 scorched that need to be killed before she will land.  If she refused to stop screaming and engage you on the ground, look for any nearby scorched.  Once you kill them, she'll drop.
---
If I see one while I'm trying to do a quest and get the feeling that it's going to be a problem, I just take it out before I dig into terminal entries or start reading/listing to notes and tapes.  You can kinda tell when they're in lurk mode, as they just keep making a wide circle over an area until they find something to fight.  Sometimes they just pass by and I never see it again.
---
I've always thought it was a poisonous gas cloud rather than acid, so the fact that it could get inside a trailer or building never really bothered me too much.
---
How did that go? Genuine question, I quit FO76 a couple of months ago so I'm not completely up to date.
---
I'm sure everyone knows how pacifist mode works. The point here is that OP is salty when he willingly engaged in hostile activities, one way or another, and lost.
---
The problem you're running into is the best players dominate with the best setups and it feels unfair at first, but it goes both ways... as my skill and character are honed it is often easy to wreck people that were where I was a month ago
---
Yeah the new event just throw them at you , got a few t-51 myself . Saving them for the player vending machines :)
---
And they even had a maintenance yesterday , what did they fix i that ?
---
I have faced these people.
---
To say the least, standing around a corner with your meth knife tends to work
---
Is that first line sarcasm?  I've seen plenty of people thinking Pacifist prevents them from entering PvP, then complaining they got killed by a player wanting to know why that's possible when in Pacifist. 
---
It was worse before the removal of slap damage. Tons of people claiming they were one-shot through slap damage, despite the mountain of evidence saying that wasn't possible.
---
They give ample warning, you just have to pay attention.
---
If you run with him you should be able to level up quickly.
---
You have to WIN 5 times
---
Theres enough pumpkins behind the pumpkin house to finish the quest.
---
It would be nice, although I tend to view the pip boy info on that screen that is more transparent on the screen than via pip boy itself. But if they brought it in and it changed the flashlight colour too then it would be more than welcome.
---
That might work.
---
The weird thing about it, in my inventory I still have the Nukashine Label, and it’s still marked like the quest is active. Yet the actual quest is no where to be found in my list of quests. I even checked all my completed quests and it’s not there.
---
Do you also want a participation trophy for playing the game?
---
mine also cost 1760, and i've only got lvl 2 hard bargain and 4 points in charisma (although i have a couple of unyielding bits so that boosts it right up)..
---
holy cow I didn't think about that. Good thinking!
---
Is that a new atom shop skin? Does it have flowers and rainbows or maybe a tootoo attached? Asking for a freind....
---
It's still there. Open your Pip Boy and press the button that says View.
---
Honestly never posting again
---
Or just let us throw them away.  I have no need for the "Fix it Good" trifecta of 1-2-3 star cards to go along with my 1-2-3 "Weapon Artisan" set.  Of course I'm always going to use the 200% card.  The amount of cards I have in my INT tree is ridiculous.  It takes like 3 seconds to scroll all the way over to Weapon Artisan because I seem to have everything in triplicate, and I can't combine rank 1 and 2 cards if I already have a card at max rank, so I'm stuck with three cards.
---
Lol.
---
Fallout 76 is canon. The only non-canon games are Fallout Tactics and Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel.
---
Unrelated to the untra cute armor, there is NOT a jetpack for the ultracite power armor.
---
The Whitespring's vendor next to the crafting benches. With the new faction vendor I sell to it now. I'm also noticing others doing the same thing so I can see if there's something I need on it.
---
All of them.
---
20 min warning after you set everything up is very little warning after all of that work
---
Sorry but I have to after you did the same. But how tf did you spell ultra wrong
---
Because your not ment to, its a community event. I do about 10 of these a day just because peoples accounts of how frequent they are
---
I suggested the same thing &amp; it was highly unpopular. Hope you have better luck.
---
I have seen Flatwoods monster and it's even based off of real-life alien sightings.
---
What I'm saying about the Mothman is that his in-game model, the giant moth, is based on real-world reports from skeptics say it's just an owl.
---
The screeching, the hunched shoulders, the wings wrapped around him like a cloak, are all traits large owls have, the large red eyes are indicative of albino owls, another thing RL skeptics have said sightings of the Mothman could be.
---
I'm not discounting that it may in-game be a government experiment gone wrong.
---
But
---
The Mothman museum was around in-game long before the bombs dropped.
---
All I am saying is I think they, they being Bethesda Games Studios, based his in-game model off of many factors from real life.
---
The owl mask from Fasnacht has a very similar appearance to the Mothman's head in the game and is used in the Helvetia church on a Mothman tribute statue with the Mothman skull moth graffiti you can find at point pleasant in game just behind it and on the top floor of the church.
---
I’d be keen to buy one from you for 500
---
What platform are you on? I wouldn't mind helping you out whenever I get on.
---
No but you need a troll of the week trophy
---
My post is about a real problem within the game and I dont really need smart answers from people who have no constructive answers to give
---
I am doubtful. Since the inception of this title, nuke zones have not contributed to any change; aside from SBQ and the legendary farming. As a rule, unless Bethesda announces otherwise, I don't think it will ever be a thing.
---
What are you talking about?
---
I honestly do not see how.. I see so many 3 star enemies and they drop 2-3 star stuff quite often.
---
I just ran into one, near my camp (same-ish place as yours) but I haven't done the sheepsquatch stuff yet so I was really confused.
---
You can always select the card again on a level up if you'd like to "downgrade".  I have Gunsmith in versions of 1-5 stars, depending on what other perks I want to use.  If I want to have 3 ranks of Nerd Rage and three ranks of First Aid for the new Encryptid fight, I only have room for one rank of Gunsmith.  I can just swap back to a four rank card later.
---
those are the exact same plans i got as rewards from the quests, i think they’re just “guaranteed” rewards. i cant wait to get the firefly, scorchbeast and *queen* mounts, i want something as a trophy for all of those queen fights i’ve participated in
---
That's really good to know. Thank you.
---
Lmao you edited it
---
sweet :) Sorry I forgot to mention this though (will edit!), are you on PC?
---
Because you don't have to aim.
---
You arent meant to do the event your self but rather do others events? How does that work? Someone has to buy the card for others to participate.
---
Ah damn, nope I’m Xbox
---
I dont know what you're talking about....
---
If so, I’ll join too
---
tommy_n1ghtmare psn
---
There's a hard limit on charisma and hard bargain discount. It's some percentage of the list price, but I can't remember what right now. I think 14 charisma with hard bargain 3 hits the cap. I don't know about your situation.
---
Remember when we didn't have survival and everyone thought guns were weak in pvp and now they're super powerful? Fun times..
---
Is that literally the only reason? My buddies and I are all high level with end game gear. Sentinel ect, my energy damage resist is well over 400 as well.  However four of us got wasted by a Tesla at the same time.
---
When I made my alt melee character I got all three hacker cards in one pack at lvl 50 or 60.  It was amazing, because I was still only grabbing "optimum build" cards.  I went from being able to hack nothing to hacking everything instantly.
---
Oh bless you. I definitely thought it was in the menu, and that seemed like a very odd thing to remove. lol I must've accidentally hit the button at some point and switched my view. Thanks!
---
No because you can just do the quest which you can do at level 25 and you do it for free. With the difficulty of this it’s obviously ment for multiple people. And with it only taking a few hours to alt a account to 25 there are so many happening all the time. People who actually pay the 2000 caps are wasting their time
---
Reading this makes me sad
---
Just means you like the game more than 99% of other humans
---
Pretty much, just shoot in the general direction of someone and you just destroy their HP and it has an chaining effect which just makes it even better. Arguably the best pvp weapon. But not sure as to what the best legendary effects are because I'm sadly not an energy weapon pro. 🤔
---
Preach lol. But then I see someone who is level 300+ and I think to myself, how the hell did that happen.
---
So people using the system in place are wasting their time because it's not worth it? That's exactly my point. It would be worth it if the drops weren't trash. Thank you for supporting my arguement.
---
&gt; An upgraded Overseers guardian is pretty much a super murdering weapon
---
Overseer's Guradian was a two shot weapon. No  the explosive effect. Two shot and explosive were two entirely separate OP effects in Fallout 4. 
---
In Fallout 76, they took two ridiculously overpowered effects and put them on the same weapon. 
---
Your comparison is laughable.
---
Interesting, I appreciate the input!
---
Lol exaclty! I sometimes feel like just starting over again with a new character to make myself feel better lol
---
I use the quick boy myself. But it would be interesting to see it with a custom color tbh
---
They should have put it at a 1 hour reset timer like the Fasnacht event.
---
That's one way to look at it 😎
---
Saw a level 438 today
---
Of course my pleasure, hope you get a good Tesla rifle if you decide to go out looking. 👍
---
I think the same, but then I remember how fragile and weak I was back then. If I need to remember what that was like I go fight the sheepsquatch imposter 🤣
---
I think alot of people have started new characters. I have, but i saw someone lvl 500+ the other night and just thought how and why?
---
I'm up for grouping every so often. I play in the U.S., Narek989
---
Yeah I’m 230 and I feel like I’m treated badly. Like people see me as a “duper” or something. They avoid me don’t want to trade or anything.  But when I play on my second character that is only lvl 30 people talk on mics ask me if I want to group up and stuff. But if I’m a big bad scary high level player I’m to be avoided. It really sucks when your trying to make friends and have some one to play with and group up with.  Hopefully once the player legendary system comes in and I’m able to prestige my character that will be fixed.
---
Thanks, I definitely see one in my very near future. With that being said I don't have much knowledge in the way of pvp. What are the other arguably best pvp weapons?
---
I have between 580 and 610 dr and about 600 er depends on my armor codition, and i have vanguard heavy bos combat armor set. Really fun to be able run a "tank" build without power armor although im currently running stealth pistol build and unarmed melee on the side
---
okies, sorry again about that. I always forget mentioning which platform I am on. Thanks for your reply regardless though (Y)
---
Totally agree, I loved the Marine Armor in Fallout 4 and really would love to wear it without all the clutter of my armor pieces. 😔
---
Having the concept of cards pretty much implies trading i dont know why this isnt a thing
---
Pretty sure the issue OP was highlighting was that server hopping causes server instability, not that it was such a big challenge to server hop
---
I'd buy one of those, if you're available tomorrow
---
yeah, i was just agreeing with you re: the price, and that something funky is going on because others are saying they can't get it below 1950 even though they have higher hard bargain than me!
---
All the workshop defend events have been bugged for weeks now. It’s only the onscreen event announcement that is wrong. PipBoy and event tracker will tell you the real enemy type that’s at the workshop.
---
I have a full set of bos combat armour plans I'm looking to put up for bids o. Reddit but I'm new and don't know how haha =o
---
I was literally talking to my mates about this lol
---
Mmm anti-armor explosive guns seem to be getting the job done really well these days. I would also try to get anti armor on your Tesla rifle. That effect seems to be a must have.
---
i dunno but i saw some good loot in there like miniguns and other weapons, so when it gets released i going there first
---
Yeah, that's RNG for you. I'm seeing a lot of 3\*s as well but they rarely drop anything above 1 stars for me. Of course, I do get a lot of Drills and Syringers...
---
Lvl 500? That's my point, there needs be a cap to avoid social outcast lol
---
I'm 226 and I see the fear from other players often. It's actually ironic, because my character is roleplayed as a bos member. I don't raid, I fight griefers and that is it. But every time I see a low level, it's either how did you get that high level or they react out of fear and are wary/ run away.
---
My husband found one on a robot that he found wandering around the world, so perhaps they have a chance of being dropped as loot.
---
Each of the power armors has their benefits, mostly stated above. Raider, good for lower levels, excavator armor gives additional carry capacity if you use every piece of it. It just depends on your needs.
---
So true!! I hope this gets fixed soon, or there's a Lvl limit with a chance to swap out perk cards
---
We were told a day in advance the shut down was happening so its on you to time for gameplay better and you wouldnt lose anything. If they had an emergency shut down I'd actually agree with you but come on mate you knew it was coming
---
How much for the knight paint?
---
From what I've seen on this sub-reddit. anti armor doesn't work with explosive or energy weapons. And the same for explosive with energy weapons. 
---
Maybe I'm wrong though.
---
Wow what platform? No one ever does this when I play. A free drink sounds delicious!
---
1.  [https://imgur.com/a/cPu5z7t](https://imgur.com/a/cPu5z7t) 
---
2. Max level 1 star explosive Gatling Gun.
---
3. The graphics screwed up when I was trying to find the Ants for an Atom challenge quest, so I was jumping worlds to find them. The first couple of times, no problem with graphics, then I punched a Scorched with a 1 Star Bloodied Power Fist and go this weird screen flash and then that one area was screwed up. Everywhere else nearby was fine.
---
Your husband found an assaultron recall card?
---
So I guess time to bully assaultrons to see if they drop it? ☹️
---
I have a bloodied vats crit and it’s actually stupid. A whole  squad just gets wrecked and don’t even know what the hell is happening. lmao it’s like Zeus is striking them down. The full auto is best as its high rate of fire acts as a work around for the max damage per shot rule that was put into place. It also builds crit juice really fast as full auto allowing me to always have a juicy crit ready to strike down my foes.  It uses the standard commando perks and vats perks.
---
Hmm have you tried inspecting the label? Or maybe going through the steps again? Im not sure what else to suggest.
---
It does energy damage which most people have very little of. Most perks are geared toward ballistic resistance so it pretty much ignores most people's defense and also as the other guy said you dont even have to ain.
---
Should be reversed. Should get no bonus to being on a team and should get instead a xp bonus for playing solo. Nothing worse than two guys riding a two seater bycycle.  Much harder to play a solo game. Many high levels achieved that with the pressure plate glitch early in the game. I remember in December seeing my first 300 and thought wow  they must be really good until I found out about the pressure plate and then thought wow what a loser.
---
There is a cap, but I don't think anyone will ever reach it since the cap is 50,000 lmao.
---
Yup. He said he found it on one of those random encounters with the eyebrows and protectrons. 
---
Hope so, I'm going hunting for them later on, I didnt even get the free one when I did the quest!
---
Actually I think they are going to work with the same system, similar to how the fermenter works- Bethesda did mention this recently (I think it was the recent patch notes?) Basically the only camp decorations we will be getting is a form of display cases and shelves etc. these will work in the same way as the fermenter, you place the items in the display object (whatever it may be) and then they can be seen by other players as decorations but not picked up and they will still be a part of your stash limit. The same goes for the player vending, which will be vending machines that use the same mechanic. I believe this is what the developers are still working struggling to get working right.
---
Thank you that definitely helps.
---
I’ve tried everything I can think of. And now I’ve lost the knowledge and password to the terminal somehow, so I have to try and find it again even though I’ve been in the security door twice
---
Also the investigators cabin references a mysterious signal
---
It was not a shutdown on all servers just the one I was on so it should be displaying a notification that this is the server being switched off even if they do say it's going to be off then how do you plan anything when you dont know what server is off
---
I miss my rifle build. If I ever make a second character I will definitely be going back to rifles. Or maybe with the upcoming Respec

I gotta find one of those eyebrows to see if I can get one to drop. It makes since for it to be in the eyebrows loot table since they must be a new enemy type with this update. Lol.
---
Np
---
Probably, although I think it was a protecton or eyebot if it was a random encounter mob.
---
Damn, then i would submit a ticket to Bethesda and see if you could try piggybacking off a friend or if you're on PC and have more than one account piggyback off yourself. Sorry i couldn't be of more help
---
I would be fine if more 2-star legendaries dropped as well. I mostly just get 1-star drops from 3-star enemies.
---
I do agree with the amount of bots being insane.
---
Lol. Have to love predictive text.
---
Guess all robots must now die.
---
That would be nice, actually. If they did I'd like all the Laying Lowe side quests, so they're just a bunch of smaller quests. I'm probably biased, though, I loved Laying Lowe and it's side quests way more than the Nukashine quest.
---
Just giving an alternative. Thank you for adding to the post.
---
on PC
---
I was trying something new, even made a big tower (seen in first pic) that is well seen at night, so I used a workshop at first but yeahm, no one showed up. When there will be player vending (and I have enough caps together for the darn neon signs, 9,2k caps shesh) I make a little hub with my camp that includes a free workstation shop, a bar and a reasonable price vending spot. Stored the Bar layout as blueprint for that.
---
The free drink (one per person) was stated on a wall, aswell prices (1 cap for a beer is cheap in comparison to what I saw).  
---
I wanna try to love this game cus I love the franchise so much, so RP like that is needed.
---
Check to see if you have any updates that need finishing. It always happens to me when Skype needs to update. Really fucking annoying.
---
Aw damn, PS4. If I had it on PC would surely come and get a few drinks. But don't let the fact that no one came today discourage you. You'll get some customers soon. ♥️
---
Or ya know a stable game ?
---
My most generous assumption is that they'll be addressing all of this when they introduce the Legendary vendor who can allow you to exchange, scrap and potentially modify your existing legendaries.
---
PSA: Radshield (I have to also assume Rad-X varieties) counts as a chem for purposes of challenges.  It lasts like 15 minutes even without the benefit of Chem Fiend perk, (rad-x is good for 10 min) so it's a nice option for the long duration and lack of addiction.
---
I still think a Walkie Talkie would be useful. A physical radio you hold, like the binoculars or the upcoming camera and 'fire' when you want to talk.
---
Then add a Citizens Band station on the pip boy radio for anyone wanting to communicate across  server :)
---
All I know it was added in, I think, the last update. I'm happy because now I can identify my own hunting rifle versus the ones I grab for the junk
---
I think to this would be a great idea after they put in private servers. I would be ticked doing a quest line to get and use a G.E.C.K. only for it to not be there the next time I login or for the location of the G.E.C.K. to be different.
---
Lol just seen this on FB and had to find the source. Ultra Cute...... classic. Like a my little pony or care bear power armour. The jet pack fires rainbows.
---
Yes there was a jetpack but was removed. Will be added in game at later stage. Data mine shows it is there.
---
How do you go about doing that?
---
Is it powered doors? I think I have them
---
Who?
---
I don’t even use rifles I’m a heavy weapons user. Originally I thought the Tesla was a heavy weapon due to the fact that it’s in the heavy weapons category for crafting.  So I use it wit the three commando perks one stat in each then various vats perks from luck and agility.
---
yuh, gotta keep stuff rolling :D
---
I am now merely trying new stuff out because endgame content like raidbosses are boring and resource heavy. So building and RP it is.
---
sure am :) I'll check up on reddit tomorrow every once and again (Y)
---
I’m down to join too I’ll add you. When do you think you’ll start it ?
---
I'll start it whenever I get people to actually join lol
---
What are the stars on it?
---
It’s seems like there’s a lot more scorchbeasts around nowadays, at least compared to when the game first came out. It would be nice if they spawned less randomly, since there’s already places to go to if you actually want to fight them. If you’re within a radius of those locations that should be fair game, but I also shouldn’t be seeing one e every time I try to wander around and I’m nowhere near a fissure.
---
And when they DID drop a 3\* is a wood armor piece.
---
Will definitely try that tomorrow.  Thanks for the advice.
---
Judging by the way the daily and weekly atom challenges are getting more time consuming, I don't think Bethesda likes giving out too many for free lol.
---
Bloodied and vats crit do 50% more damage. Don’t even need the crits bloodied alone is enough with the guns high rate of fire. And good base damage
---
IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY...there is a way to edit it somehow using an ini file, I remember on release seeing a thread on how to do it.
---
I play adventure mode, i dont like pvp in this game, my weekly iz to complete hunter hunted 5 times wearing different outfits....
---
I assume you are using unyielding and radicool adrenal ect. What is the cap for your damage on it at low health?
---
While in the low levels i used to take them on only if i had cover like a tree or a wall. Now i pick up my .50cal and blow them out of the sky. When they are 2 or 3 cover i needed though.
---
Yes, and that's what I also have done. But for Gunsmith you need to use 15 levels of perks to get all. Why is it made so difficult, when you all ready have unlocked levels 1-4 when getting to level 5.
---
It's just bad design and IMO should be changed.
---
Here, have a downvote for your idea.
---
What's so obvious? All of my old images on PS4 are still on my HDD, even if I deleted them in game...

Found it! Still works.
---
You are suffering from Blood Worms.

I agree. I'm suddenly just getting 10 or 20 caps a day now, and then maybe 1 or 2 weeklys as well. How am I supposed to save up for things in the Atom store?

I would look soooo good in ultra cute power armor.

Granted.

It's a walking cane though.

Own your mistakes. In this case it’s a hilarious one, so chill..

Lol fuck. Why do you hate me Todd Howard?

Might be best to make posts until you have a good following of regular patrons.

Used to feel the same way, just avoid the top 3 ‘killers’ on the board, or anyone who has more than 5 or so kills.

Classic scorched hivemind movement.
---
The Assaultron Key Card is in the Misc. section of your inventory.
---
Your PA , weapon's power, cover and friends if you are in a group is really what get you to that point.

I still tend to avoid them only because they are not worth my hard search/crafted ammo i use on them.

Cremation engine, it just hurts!
---
I rock PA so no unyielding. But I do have adrenaline reaction and at around 50% health I get over 200 damage per shot. And since it shoots ridiculously fast nothing stands a chance. If I use it out of pvp the games thinks I’m hacking and stops me from doing damage and I have to quit to the menu and find a new server. It doesnt know how to handle 3000 individual damage in 3 seconds across 5 targets lol.  I have no idea what my max damage potential is since I get damage bugged when using it for PvE. Tried it at the imposter sheep battle and got about 3 clips in before I couldn’t do any more damage.
---
Yeah didn't seem too haha.
---
Say's the agent of the Enclave serving evil to the wasteland on a daily basis 😒
---
Probably they though about opening a Vault (looks like a pin is there) but then decided to go sub-Harpers Ferry
---
To be fair. You shouldn't need to use so many animals packs if you have some decent coordination with your team and the random that show up.  I was a conduit for all 3 pylons today and got several hits on the assaultron and only used 5 or 6 stims.   It can be done rather fast.  Like.  Under a minute.  Assuming you have decent teammates with dps.  But ya.  1 star and 2 star drops are insulting.
---
Yeah reading through all the comments has enlightened me to this, I think it was the abrupt ending in which we went to the last terminal and nothing happened and the quest ended and I was like "oh I guess that's it then" but after doing more reading I see its all about the event.
---
Wow that's insane. I wish I had known all of this prior to moving all of points from perception to strength 🤦‍♂️
---
Xbox here. 2nd in command of the Appalachia Brotherhood of Steel [Currently Knight Sergeant
---
- since me and a few friends reformed the Brotherhood] (Xbox) Discord, you ever need any help on Xbox just know the Brotherhood has your back civilian! If you're looking to join up let me know.
---
Yes. I need an Enclave flag for my CAMP, and posters too.
---
And all of you in power armor....Please take workshops and keep carrying stable flux on your person so I don't have to farm it myself.
---
Thoughts? 
---
This should have been in the game from Day 1
---
I never knew you could farm plastic at Watoga Highschool. I still go to Morgantown High school for plastic. I’ll check out Watoga later.
---
I only have 3 perception lmao. Bloodied and adrenaline reaction wombo combo is just too strong. On top of that the Tesla just takes advantage of it because of the chaining just makes the damage stack
---
They should be three times stronger than a normal creature.
---
C'MON, WHERE'S THAT BOURBON?! :D
---
real talk, friendly badasses in this game are the best players.
---
Cannot lock my terminal either.
---
So you only took 3 points in commando then? That's way more manageable as I still have two points in perception. I'm a bloodied build as well. Based in melee but I have been considering using heavy as well rather than shotty. Getting Thor'd by a Tesla tonight sold me for sure.
---
I do believe liberators have a small (very small) drop chance for it
---
It worked perfect for me. I think u can get around 80 plastic and some aluminum. Usualy did it on the cap runs when I was done with the train station there.
---
Try Morgantown High School. There's a lot of different kinds of junk there and there's a chemistry work bench in the science lab to break down the junk. 
---
Camp McClintock is great for springs from the clipboards.
---
Office buildings are good for fans and typewriters for screws.
---
Was this on Xbox?
---
Ok I’m ready when you are lol
---
I still remember yesterday when I walked to mail box and picked mail. Good times.
---
I have one point in each of the commandos so a total of 30% damage increase. I only use it for pvp when some one tries to yeet my workshop
---
I'm just 118 and feel the same sometimes.
---
Surprised that you got killed so often. Over 200 hours of playing i got killed once by another player  (i am in pacifist mode)   
---
and sad and funny how "low" level players are scared of higher level players.  I am level 79 and yesterday wanted to give plans to a level 28 and he just fast travelled away when i made the follow me sign so i could show him the paper bag on the ground.
---
does this happen for scrounger perk too? had no idea
---
If I am correct the Beer Keg is a reward for one of the weekly challenges, the one about crafting booze:
---
[https://imgur.com/KgFapPl](https://imgur.com/KgFapPl)
---
I had a cursory look on the other plans (the taxidermy ones) and they are either not linked to any event/levelled list yet or they are linked to quests/events that are not yet - as far as I know anyway - active.
---
I put my hand up, I did not thoroughly check every plan; there are tons of them and personally I am not that fussed except for one or two I'd like which cannot be currently acquired.
---
Of course they dont want us to do any challenges. they want us to spend microtransaction money.
---
Probably all the DLC for this year was already designed but the hurry for money.
---
Using rad away will increase your chance of a disease. So use antibiotics to cure the first disease you get after using rad away. Antibiotics increase disease resistance.
---
Yes, maybe I don't have the best flag for this statement (to be honest I didn't remember having it).
---
However the point stays: a well armed, armored veteran of a militarist organization IS a scary presence
---
I feel ya. I made it embarrassingly far not knowing that too.
---
Fantastic. The Deathclaw should have been this big, but hanks for the warning.
---
Don't worry! Just keep playing and thinking this game is fine. Eventually you get another useless 3\* item with crappy stats.
---
Energy weapons need their own legendary effects, which can make them more unique and usable
---
I appreciate this! I've been curious since release of the statues how big they are in game.
---
Or a safe place to be in a world that would destroy you or take advantage of you. Ad Victoriam!
---
Please reserve one for me, I'll def have one please: ToneLeMoan. When will you be on?
---
I love how you can be lvl 15 and while questing you encounter lvl 68 enemies and being chased by lvl 60 scorchbeast that shoots through walls all at the same time. I just hated the game when I was around that level. Recently created a new character and remembered how bad it actually was.
---
I haven't found any plans for the ultra cute jet pack either. Will update accordingly as I farm.
---
2 caps and its yours! Unless first time visit, then its for free. :D
---
I mean that arkos had involvement there. Not that they where connected
---
Have you clicked on it yet...?
---
good calling though thanks
---
Well I know what I'll be putting back in perception haha
---
Now we just need people that actually activate the pylons and not shoot the damn sheep 15 minutes long while its stealthed.
---
I played for a while until I learned that as well, I don't see any benefit to it so I honestly think maybe it was just lazy coding.... It should just have the items spawn in the crate like normal.
---
Unconfirmed and meaningless anecdotes should not be taken seriously. That's not evidence, that's hearsay.
---
There is only one way to Role-play this game. You play a role where you tell other people how good and interesting this game is.
---
I’m almost wondering if the armor pen or stagger is better than base damage. Mainly due to the faster fire rate makes up for not having massive damage per shot I’ll have to play around wit it more. I have 15 respect points just sitting around just waiting to be used
---
I am not using skype or any stuff like that and i find that at times aswell. My game always crash when i exit to desktop so i have ctrl+del.
---
on PC and it is HELLA annoying. Have been trying to modify weapons and armors with stuff that cant be learned and its bugging (hah) me the hell out.   
---
I wrote a bug report ticket so I advice anyone having this issue to do that aswell. The more we shout teh sooner they hear. Reddit and forum entries are not enough.
---
Same on my PS4, bought the stealth boy mod from the enclave for my x-01 and I cannot fit it on too my power armour.
---
[https://imgur.com/a/KH4Unkg](https://imgur.com/a/KH4Unkg)Yep !
---
Let me know if it does!
---
If your on PC I can sort you out with some ammo and some weapons :) could even build you a custom handmade to suit your level and give you ammo for it
---
So were all PUBG players, is it out of alpha yet? But because it was so popular among kids and all of it's casual PvP fanbase everyone would still pay for it. Genius how you can take advantage of underaged people to make a million. At least F76 is a good game.
---
Rofl might need to load into a new world, it wasn't doing that for me... However I wish you could trigger a remotely so you could actually see up from a distance rather than right next to it.
---
Nice opinion
---
Oouu good idea! I'd love that.
---
I'm online now, if you're interested (Y) my comprehension of English is a bit basic so I'm not sure what you mean with novelty, heh. Anyways, I'm "uberole" in-game! :)
---
So, is this a bad thing?
---
This is where I got mine.
---
It is solo-able, but the robots adds do respawn.
---
I did some maps some days ago. The first ones worked but aftew a while didn't show me the loot. It was anyway in my inventory but he didn't tell me what I had found. Only a graphical problem
---
Deathclaw + Cazador = ultimate fear
---
Just make it a toggle in the armor's modification menu, easy. Then you wouldn't even have to craft a second outfit or wear a vault suit over your vault suit or anything.
---
Ahhh MAN, and I \*just\* got my X-01! :(
---
No, just very patient!
---
Seems like it was my wrong impression. It breaks with a moderate speed, as it should (would be awesome to have even longer durability life of course... but it's still better than before).
---
I don't think the game is fine. It's fun but fine it is not. It would be fine if Bethesda would do some proper Q&amp;A but we've yet to get a patch that fixes shit without breaking something else or introducing stealth nerfs no one cares about.
---
How much atoms is this? Might actually have to buy atoms for the first time.
---
Are you on PC with mods? I had this issue with some of the new apparel in the update. If you've edited the .ini file to load modded archives, you'll need to update it again to include the archives from the last patch.
---
I got the issue. I assumed this was a buggy mod, I don't know if this is generalized...
---
Np. People are hesitant to enter some camps. And a sign that ways peace or anything that shows no ill will will scare them off.
---
Probably why they messed with Watoga. And it not spawning as many legendary since this release
---
Hmmm, did not know about the spinoffs. What about Fallout NV? Where does that fit in?
---
Ive got a 2shot tesla, its not that good in PVE at all imo, but never tried it in pvp.
---
( note, rifleman build and not commando with auto tesla) 
---
Perhaps i should try it out, hope they buff it for pve tho, its a coolass wep 🤘
---
The conduit players have to heal up, but stim packs aren't the only way to heal. . . and there's ways to make those stims more efficient too. It is pretty trivial to achieve hundreds/thousands of diluted stim packs, all with first aid + chem fiend + optionally biocomm mesh. Suddenly being the conduit is pretty easy.
---
500 Atoms
---
On my post some said they found on in a random encounter with eyebots...
---
They need to have Legendary armor for power armor to even the playing Fields
---
I like that!
---
Go in the main entrance, go down the stairs, past the central area and in the back is an executive office. There should be one in there.
---
I had mods 3 patches ago but i cleaned everything because of the costant updates
---
Looks like I’m safe lol.
---
As many? I kill about 1500 robots since Tuesday have seen any Legendaries and those gutsy patrols show up about every third loop
---
Oh yeah for sure. I thought the weapon was for peasants until my whole team got merc'd by one in a solid second or two. Never seen such a thing ever except before the was nerfed, when I killed a whole team of four twice with my TSE handmade. Sadly those days are gone lol
---
Typically there is a cultural area in the region consisting of parts of southwest virginia, west virginia, kentucky and Tennessee. 
---
People from that area refer to it as Appa-Latch-uh. The latch being the important part. Not everyone in the states say it that way but its a common thing for people with intense family roots to use the latch pronunciation.  
---
Its a way to bind the area, originally it was mainly a quirk of the area but it became more than that over time. More urban people usually "correct" the locals. Typically the same type of people who make movies like wrong turn and call the area full of inbred hicks. 
---
So its sorta a sense of pride for a lot of people there. Which is why its important to a lot of people than Bethesda used thay pronunciation in the game for many natives.
---
I feel your pain dude - I'm too low level right now to try the boss but could it be that the intention here is to pack on the energy resist buffs/armour if you become the conduit?
---
Bethesda must have playtested this - I am sure that we as a community must be missing something. it reminds me of when Molten Core in WoW was first being discovered and people were underestimating how much fire resist was necessary.
---
My hope is that eventually we will discover that there are tactics/builds/ gear/buffs that make this boss not cost 100s of stims.
---
Literally infuriating. I don’t get worked up easily but I was yelling at my TV.... he’s clearly not taking damage! Someone else activate a pylon!
---
If you say it that way, you're a friend to me. 
---
Southwest virginia born and raised.
---
well played, my  friend, well played
---
lol 230 isn't even that high. I have alts around that level. . . but yeah people avoid 100-200+ characters.
---
Just had another episode of this. I especially liked the level 5 player in his fresh vault suit trying to get revived in the middle of if.
---
Collect a ton of scrap, turn it to bulk. You can then sell the bulk materials to vendors. Materials like silver, gold and screws won't be able to be turned to bulk but can be sold as individual pieces to vendors.
---
Also, do some Whitesprings runs and sell weapons, grenades and legendaries dropped.
---
same, Xbox one.
---
I was lvl 32 in withespring grind some exp and nearby some legendary got a 3 star so not bad then the warning atombomb on the fly I looked on the map and I think hell yes withespring nuke.. I know from some yt it was looking massiv fun..... The bomb was down and I found 2 enemy's they fight some npc's waste some radaway on the search for more to punish, my power armor is not 100% rad save but was ok after 10 min for searching for more I just logged out and joined a new server
---
what a waste of 15 min...
---
Unbombed it was 10x more enemy's in this 1 spot.. I was not more so exited and when a bomb fall I server hop, what a fail.
---
Yes, but it does double damage and not just 25% extra as two shot does in FO76. Add explosive with it's 20% extra and you're still not up to the 100% extra it does in FO4.
---
Near Hopewell http://imgur.com/gallery/SzLBFeX it is don't work yet
---
I’ve done the full circuit starting the train station and circled the city killed the deathclaw and the Mirelurks at the farm at least 16 time since Tuesday and have see 2 legendary bots a plain non starred and a 3⭐️ that committed seppuku fresh out the tube and took no damage. Just saw the world and said “I’m out”
---
There's more than enough right behind the bloody house lol. Quest takes 30 seconds.
---
Nah it is important to some people. But its a cultural thing, not everyone says it the exact same but normally it varies on exact location but its typically a variant of latch, lash etc. Don't say lay  though. As long as your didn't argue and say the other person was incorrect you're golden.
---
People shouldn't give you crap for it but some do. But a lot of it comes from people who say it the "correct" way historically talking bad about the area and the people there. 
---
If you want a warmer welcome though stick with the latch uh.
---
Read somewhere it's going to be an instance.
---
You get 30 atoms for that.
---
Nah, just a bug
---
I've seen diseased bots in the game...
---
But you do not get the plan for the keg (or the ability to craft the keg for that matter)?
---
The reason why I inferred it was a reward is... well, because is listed in the record.
---
There's no way they will allow it. Too many inappropriate images will get uploaded. 😂
---
I've entered the bunker through the door in the Whitespring, and though I'm *in* the bunker, my dot will show that I'm in the hotel.  
---
I'm not sure if it works the other way around, but it's possible, I guess.  
---
Your person could've entered the Whitespring from the bunker, so it kept their dot on the bunker.
---
Which is why it needs to be guaranteed 3*
---
Aren’t there only a certain amount of photos you can take anyway? I’m sure I had to delete some to make way for new ones.  Unless it’s changed since the new camera thingy, which I know nothing about!
---
Like those “welcome mats” from fo4!
---
If you placed one in a settlement, you’d go there every time you fast traveled there!
---
I tend to pass players by other players bases in case it is a trap or not being welcome.
---
So A perfect getaway isn’t in the game yet. I keep getting a notification to search the campsite and all I found was Cindi dairy. Makes sense it doesn’t go further than that.
---
used a workshop for this cus idk if its just me, but ppl like to snack my workshops away a lot, only this time no one gave a damn lol
---
Indeed, except to catch out the new users what is the point of needing a double action to proc the perk.
---
Very strange design decision.
---
If you're talking about the scorchbeast queen I think whoever puts the fatal bullet into it gets the kill and everyone else gets the so only. So that's maybe why it doesn't count for the challenge.
---
I was lucky and killed a leg deathclaw at fissure  prime so I can confirm prime is a viable site.
---
I haven't been frequenting Watoga so much as I normally would.  
---
The bots *still* just up and die out of nowhere? -.-'
---
I am more the player that play the stick that beats the beast. Death is just part of the game for me.
---
I’m level 54 and I love seeing higher level characters! If your looking for a friend I love a good carry😂
---
This was a post I took back in Dec 2018, the queen was easily solable then.
---
Now its not solable.   That alone is evidence that they did in fact change the queen.
---
thanks to toxic or troll players I guess. This is why RP is such a hard thing to do lol
---
Bethesda: lets make people RP the world envi
---
playerbase: lolnope trolling time
---
atleast it aint griefing (yet) like GTA:O
---
Here's an idea, if I'm in full power armor, make me immune to contracting diseases.
---
Considering the acid attacks don't even affect me half the time I'm okay with it going through walls and ceilings.
---
I can’t remember exactly which one, but one of the faction vendors inside of the White Spring Resort should have them. Just bought it today.
---
I've built the "Old Roadhouse" along the road south of Morgantown. It's a bar and I've had some guests. The first came by just as I was finishing up building. He looked around and sat down at the bar. I stood behind the bar and offered different kinds of beer and spirits. He bought a few, got up and made the heart emote. I later got a friend request I happily accepted. There's been a few others including a team of three people in spacesuits wearing the tin foil hats. They were great fun, bought a beer or two and played the instruments, took some photos and left a present before taking off.
---
I really love the community in FO76.
---
Regardless of how fast it may be for some people, it's not that way for everyone. I could hit the cap limit pretty quick but don't see much point of it. When it comes to selling specific gear, like tse and the like, I prefer to sell at lower prices rather than higher. I've traded many tses and I've never has a transaction where the price was more than 6k per item. Some people may try to sell them for a much higher price, but vast majority of sellers on Xbox lfg will set there prices between 1 and 5k.
---
Some people inflate their prices like crazy, while I'm not about that. I don't trade to get rich, im content with setting my prices low, that way more people are able to buy from me and I move items far quicker. There is a pretty big divide between players when it comes to the god builds, I don't want that to carry over to trading. Players shouldn't need 25 thousand caps just to buy one item.
---
So the server maintenance they just did didnt fix anything, great. They had made so much progress with server stability and completely screwed it up in one patch.
---
He's probably not high enough to take it out, which is why he's probably bitching about it
---
People have been complaining about legendaries since release and the CMs never respond to posts about it and bethesda have nerfed legendaries into the ground. If I run my legendary route from a few months ago I'm lucky if I find one 3*, used to be 5 or 6.
---
It's still odd though that they appeared in a room where I could see everything. I don't know how good stealth boys are but it seemed a bit suspicious. Especially since there was like 10 minutes of me doing nothing they didnt appear until I turned the radio back on.
---
And when I died I didnt respawned instantly cause I wanted to look at them and they just stood there looking at my body
---
Ooh! How about Rainbow Unicorn?
---
I killed my first scorch beast at 37, whittled it down easily and honestly it didn't really do much damage. Now at 41 with a few gun upgrades it's really not a bother. Idk if you just have bad aim or what but I easily hit them in the head even while flying.
---
“Prototype x01” is a paint job for x01 armour, for some reason when you get the schematic from the enclave it crafts it as the prototype set by default if u want you can change it under paintjob.
---
Just you
---
That’s a solid idea, just like we can build the decontamination arch!
---
While this will be a short delay and a buggy release
---
Wow 1000 caps for a common drop?
---
Good luck
---
Makes sense
---
I feel you man lev 25 to 50 was a stressful battle for me. If youre on xbox I can help too. People here just want you to enjoy the game
---
Death aura yeah happens still even in the enclave bunker as well
---
I first noticed it when I was building my camp near Whitespring. I had all the camp bonuses on, food bonuses, and the antibiotics bonus and still got diseases one after the other.
---
The damage numbers are identical. If you’re using a combat shotgun try the armor penetration magazine
---
Any event marker can mess up. I've had defend monongah pop up in cranberry bog
---

---
As a conduit, I've found that using an automatic weapon with the Vampire's legendary effect is extremely useful for keeping my health in check.
---
I mean programming is hard
---
100% agree
---
Could be wrong, but pretty sure I bought the plan for this from the vendor in flatwood.
---
Give us a real Mothman you cowards.
---
I had thought about keeping Plague Walker when I got it one time but at the time there were problems with it causing damages to other players/NPCs like the robots at Whitespring. Have they fixed that?
---
Agree. Military Fatigues, Brotherhood Fatigues, Vault Suits, can't really wear any of them cause they just get covered up by armor. Especially bad for Vault suits like the VTU suit - nobody will ever be able to tell it's different than the average Vault 76 jumpsuit if you're wearing a chestpiece.
---
Bastard keeps spawning outside my camp bedroom. If I could kill him, stuff him and mount him on my wall I'd be happy too
---
We have the technology, we can rebuild him.
---
In game I'm feeling a Mothman Skin Bean Bag chair.
---
K
---
Head over to the whitesprings shops they added a vendor from each faction there, I was able to purchase one from the brotherhood of steel vendor and the responder vendor there. I'm sure more have them as well.
---
I noticed the same.  3-4 crashes on the machine and a disconnect or two.
---
Well done that man,I do the same with lower level items I got and don't need to use and rather than selling them I like to pass them on to the new guys to help them out to me this is what the game is all about.
---
Nope, can't attach mods either.. wonder what they were up to yesterday with the patch. They didn't fix the workbench issue or the V-sync/clipping issue with camps either 🤷‍♂️
---
Her husband found a rare traveling responder vendor that sells unique outfits.
---
Idk. Somewhere. People figured it would because how Nuka cola was in game.
---
Stop bitching
---
Someone mentioned that glowing enemies can infect you with radiation damage which makes no sense...
---
Yeh seen it many times way south of where it should be thought they had moved it.
---
1* Instigating Drill is on top of the loot list.
---
1) Mods are broken right now. You can't equip them unless you know the plans. 2) The calibrated shocks mod always has pulled up the screen that looks like you are crafting it and need the flux even though you don't and just need to hit apply when it's working properly.
---
If you have the mod, you don't need the mats. Just click on it and it will install it. It looks like you need the mats but you don't. You can get mods at random places like Camden Vendor, Grafton and the red rocket stop in the mire. You can just pick it up. The plans allow you to build shocks, but you need the 10 violet. You can try sell some shocks to recoup some of your money.
---
Just keep checking the vendors, eventually they will show but are rare.
---
You know... I've read through most of these comments and I think to myself... why doesn't Bethesda just tell us? I mean why is so frickin impossible to explain to the public precisely how the loot tables ACTUALLY function in the game?
---
Waiting for you to vanish for re-spawn or looking at the map searching for your dot?
---
Seems they are just doing the hunting thing to me.
---
This! When I saw a voice slider, and a radio slider, I thought they had it  
---
Nope. Someone doesn't play console.
---
I’ve got 7, with the Vaccinated Perk, and I only eat Vegetable Medley Soup whole in full PA
---
You need a dildo to shut your mouth.
---
That would be a bit pointless, I’m guessing you’re unlucky to go just after someone has harvested the place.
---
Happened to me at all my favourite farming locals.
---
Well, not much to beware... the description clearly says it is life-size, that is why I bought it.
---
Boo boo. What are you a level 300 with no life? Get over it loser.
---
Not sure but i think you only use one mod as it counts as a mod for both legs. Please correct if i am wrong.
---
Yeah I have the same problem anyone has some advice to fix it?
---
If I decide to be in the market for one in the future word in the sub is you have quite the collection. Any recommendations?
---
"This is a group event that needs group attention and not a bunch of solo players trying to solo it at same time" 
---
**golf clap**
---
Whitesprings or Watoga station since they provide a tinker's workbench which is usefull to bulk &amp; sell.
---
Ok. So.
---
First of all, mods currently are not working correctly. If you buy or find a mod for power armor, armor or weapons, it will not attach right now. Mods you've learned from plans should still work correctly.
---
Second: You're not going to have a lot of luck buying a standalone Excavator Calibrated Shocks mod. You're gonna want to buy the plans from the Grafton Responder vendor, which are pretty expensive.
---
Third, yes nuke zones seem to be few and far between lately. You could always make your own luck and launch a nuke on your own. If you are specifically after violet flux, the Fissure Prime area is quite good. Equip green thumb and you'll get quite a bit of raw violet flux from the mutated fern plants in the area and butchers bounty should maximize your glowing mass, hardened mass and radiated fluids from the mobs and then chemist and super duper should maximize the amount of stable flux you craft. 
---
Oh and if you really want to maximize your excavator carrying capacity consider adding Motion Assist Servos to the torso. That'll add another +2 STR to the armor.
---
Stop breaking the rules of the sub and acting like a child.
---
You can collect this Jacket in the Psi House.
---
I've found so much crap over the recent months and in the last two weeks weeks I finally found two things that didn't suck. It's nice to finally have RNG give me something useful. That said there really is nothing more frustrating that getting 1* trash from a 3* or one of the boss monsters.
---
Play on a sterile install of your OS and fresh install of game. Use no chat clients in the background, no Fraps etc. Test to see if crash occurs, reintroduce favourite 3rd party apps one at a time, re test.
---
67 Server hops over 2 hours, and not a single legendary enemy. I saw 21 times where there were no spawns,  but the other 46 times I saw pretty much every combination of X attacking and Y defending. Mostly super mutants, scorched, and robots defending, but saw lots of diversity in the attackers (gulpers, fog crawlers, mirelurk kings, sentry bot, super mutants, ghouls). I guess I'm supremely unlucky. This daily challenge will have to go incomplete.
---
Try to *scan and repair* your game files. Works on PC a bit.
---
Yikes, which one of your parents hit you for you to be so upset. But close, level 188.
---
Nope happening on all systems right now.
---
I noticed that yesterday. Was trying to fit an auto barrel to an ultracite laser and nothing was happening.
---
I seem to have an affinity for pipes and boards. I finally in the past few weeks got a handmade and a Gatling Gun that aren't useless.
---
It's one per leg.
---
Or we could just tell people where it may spawn, cough cough, Morgantown High School.
---
Hope ur right! ;)
---
What was that about "bitching"?
---
I think I was maybe lvl 35 the first time I tried to kill a scorchbeast, which was attacking my camp across the street from Charleston FD.  It appeared when another player around lvl 70 started building a camp near mine.  I had a non-legendary combat rifle with decent mods and a bolt action pipe rifle that I crafted, also with good mods.  It wasn't easy, but I killed the damn thing.  The other guy kept grabbing new guns out of his stash, started freaking out because his minigun wasn't killing it immediately, ragequit after about 3 minutes while swearing nonstop and calling the game a pile of shit, and I just stuck around for the challenge to see if I could win.  I did, and maybe that's why I'm now able to one-shot lvl 50 scorchbeasts with a banked crit, good perks and an instigating rifle.  I just learned to adapt and improve while the other guy probably isn't playing anymore.
---
https://imgur.com/HyzNObo for the obligatory "big game hunter photo".  I still get "memorieeees" when it shows up as a load screen.  I was so young and naive.
---
I'm on PC. I can select the mod I bought but only get a "rads" sound and nothing else happens.
---
[          CAUTION         ]
---
you can buy the plans for the excavator calibrated shicks and craft them yourself if you wanna skip the server hopping.
---
I see a great benefit. The server does not need to calculate these items until you do the actual search,  which puts less stress on the servers. No matter how good a server is or how well coded it is, it will always be an improvement to have items not exist in the database until they are needed. While it sucks for us, it is good for... well, us.
---
You do realize that money doesn’t grow on trees and atoms are really overpriced?
---
They perhaps would like to, you know... roleplay. Perhaps actually be that NPC everybody has been missing so much in this game. Staying at your bar and serving passers by would suddenly be possible so not everyone will pass by that empty bar because the owner had to leave to just stay alive.
---
 👀👀👀 🤣🤣🤣
---
Well if this is issue gets posted a lot we can grab Bethesda’s attention about it.
---
I have been doing the challenges every day since beta and can def confirm the daily and weekly challenge difficulty has greatly increased over time.
---
I don't mind it too much as long as it's reasonable, but the challenges for hunter hunted, and the ones that have you try complete some event with a ridiculously high respawn time are clearly chosen to make sure people don't earn too many atoms from gameplay. 
---
(it took me 30 minutes of constant server hopping last night to find a server that had the path to enlightenment active :P )
---
You can easily find this by server hopping that frat house you go to for the alcohol brewing quest they added, among other locations. Not worth a thousand caps.
---
Take a workshop and just stand there for five minutes. Someone will come to collect the caps.
---
Yes! I want those weird totems in the Mothman Museum! The ones with the crossbones and the gas masks!
---
Right!? Have you seen the ritual site just outside of point pleasant? That shit looks cool
---
I somehow lost my chassis out of my inventory but had all the parts. Went to the train station and there was like ten chassis there all of a sudden. All of my parts showed as having the new skin but when put on the base showed up as normal. I don’t know what’s going on.
---
Are you sure is a Biv reward?
---
I had a look in the esm and I can only find one COBJ record for a beer keg:
---
workshop\_co\_Brewing\_BeerKeg \[COBJ:003FBC4E\]
---
With this description:
---
'The Beer Keg is a container which can dispense mixed drinks in your C.A.M.P.'
---
In order to craft it one needs:
---
Recipe\_Workshop\_Crafting\_Brewing\_BeerKeg "Plan: Beer Keg" \[BOOK:003F4749\]
---
Which is referenced by (and only by):
---
Challenge\_Weekly\_Craft\_Alcohol\_Meta\_Low\_Brewing\_Spotlight "Craft different types of alcohol" \[CHAL:004124B1\]
---
I can see no link to Biv's questline anywhere.
---
I had one camp where I would always spawn underwater and pinned down under a foundation.  Good times.
---
"Also come with the explosion effects" - so totally worth it :)
---
If they'd want players to be able to socialize then it should definately benefit the game to let CAMP owners stay in their CAMP when player vedning is released. Instead of just accessing a machine outside a locked box house you could be invited in to the nice store/bar/garage and actually meet the owner and socialize.
---
This would be made possible if the option to stay alive in your CAMP was supported by growing things.
---
PREACH  
---
Gave up after the 20th hop for path of enlightenment  
---
Very well bethesda, keep your atoms
---
I redownloaded and installed , did not help. Getting furious soon at this game
---
Some people can be really great tho. I met nasty idiots before, but most of those moved into Survival so thats good.
---
Or just kidnap some developer. That's what raiders do, right?
---
Yeah why would I be scared of the weird tech cult??!?!?!
---
Now THAT was worth 1000 caps
---
I really don’t understand why server hopping is encouraged. It completely breaks the economy. There’s no supply and demand when everyone can jump constantly to get what they want. 
---
They need to gate and discourage it. I’ve never played a game before that involves constantly going to the main menu to jump between servers lol.
---
I'll have to check my inventory once I get to play.
---
sadly i don't have the caps to buy such expensive plans again (since i bought the t-60 shock plans) nor do i have the materials to craft (the violet flux)
---
*16 times the kid napping*
---
Oh jeez lol yeah. Got an mixed up
---
[https://imgur.com/a/KH4Unkg](https://imgur.com/a/KH4Unkg) Kind of lol
---
If you haven't here is [pics of the site](https://imgur.com/gallery/fro1yRE)
---
Outside of point pleasant? Not that I can think of? I’ll check it out tomorrow! Where is it? North? South? East? West? Any combination thereof? 
---
I also like the weird cult stuff in the Kawhana County Cemetery church(probably spelled that wrong) and the bizzare thing at the church in Helvetia. Haven’t been through the cult mine yet though, because I’m sick cave crickets and radrats, which I suspect will spawn in there. They’re annoyingly damaging and they just look creepy. (Especially the weird little eyes of the radrats as they bite at your feet).
---
Would be a good idea, kinda like the same thing they did with skyrim
---
What material are you going for? It seems like the items it wants you to “collect” like wood can’t be scrapped to gain them. The ones that say “scrap to collect” like aluminum work.
---
thank you for taking the time for this useful info. had no idea about the mods being bugged for the moment.
---
I don't see this happening unless they can somehow ensure photos taken are stored server side and are reviewed (by a Bethesda employee) before being available to display in our camps. You can already changed screenshots on PC (that are randomly displayed during loading screens) to whatever you want (like a resource map). Someone is bound to change those image files to porn and plaster those photo frames around their camp unless they add something to guarantee it can't be done.
---
I have to go run behind a tree while my camp loads. It takes a couple of minutes to completely finish loading. I got trapped in the basement a couple of times, so now I run away. Luckily, my gun turrets are active during all this. I usually have company when I come home.
---
i ll mod them for you if you want, i have the flux. If you provide the other mats (minus flux) i can do lets say.. 1.5k for both?
---
Goddamn that’s awesome! I’ll have to investigate the area myself. I must find this!
---
They say the removal of NPCs would be offset by players. That was a big design intent. I think that letting CAMPs support players actually playing bartenders and bakers would follow their intent and it would be a step towards Fallout being a roleplaying game again and not just a shooter with looting.
---
I've not looked into Kanawha but the stuff in Helvetia is definitely Mothman, I think the stuff in the mine is connected to something called the interloper, but a while back I've seen someone suggest they are all part of the same cult. Lemme grab a screenshot of the approximate location real quick.
---
I seen and killed him at white springs he surprised me just standing there starring on my way back to my house after gathering water. He started attacking when I got close and the robots went nuts and helped me kill it. I was only level 30 at the time I think maybe lower lol.
---
I haven't seen any legendary Protectrons in Watoga since Patch 8. Also I haven't seen any non-robot legendaries on the outskirts either.
---
Watoga Clinic is okay, or even better as I now get a legendary there way more often.
---
They should've implement event timers just like the one in guild wars 2. This way we should know when the next event will start instead checking the world map over and over again every 5-10 mins just in case we missed the event, and avoiding server hopping over and over again. Less stress to the server and people actually play the game instead logging on and off for XX minutes / hours.
---
Argh I wanted to try to disintall and reinstall but if dont work I don't know what to do
---
You said you couldn’t see him , you sure he wasn’t just stealth boy’d?
---
Yeah. I was frustrated that I had to actively scrap for things that I had a ton of already (looking at you aluminum). And then remembered the bulk mats auto-scrapping. Decided to test it out, and it worked wonderfully.
---
True enough, I thought he was like level 20 or something and then seen a reply by him saying he was 37 or something. 
---
Definitely just sounds like he's under geared and bitching instead of learning the game.
---
I always press the space bar after extracting stuff to do the "search".
---
Just done that challenge to be sure and nope it's just the atoms.
---
I shelved the game until patch 9 😫 tried lots of other online games but they work smoothly so it has to be servers
---
I agree of not being able to grow all the plants but a few more, definately. It's also ridiculousy hard to find some of the plants, like those flowers that require an event to trigger.
---
Oh that’s interesting. I only had the Flatwoods Monster left to kill... but I wonder what would have happened for people already completed the challenge?
---
I think you’re ultra cute op
---
Ooh I want one, I’ll pay you 2000 caps!
---
Yeah, the mine one is something more Lovecraftian, from what I’ve seen on here. 
---
But Kanawha has a impaled corpse dripping with blood on the second floor, and a few other weird things. And I think some totems too, but it’s been a while since I went. 
---
Ooh, thanks!
---
Dammit!
---
Wish I knew more about how these challenge records work. Currently I don't know how to tell which ones are active.
---
Either way thanks for the 'field report', much appreciated.
---
Disease resistant from being well fed and well hydrated does not seem to work either.
---
On the main menu the challenges menu tells you what's what. And you're welcome, gave me the motivation to get it done.

If you're wearing power armor it gives a better compass bearing but head E / SE in between 113 and 158 on the PA compass
---
People DO play video games because they expect something from them. I for one WANT to play Fallout, not RDR2 or Witcher 3 or friggin Destiny. This beloved IP is slowly being executed and bastardized with bugs, crashes, micro transactions, and worst of all a very shallow gameplay loop. The fans wanted a well done Open-world RPG. I have played hundreds of hours of FO76 and I love it. Unfortunately it's not really an MMORPG. This game is a bit more like FarmVille with Scorchedbeasts. They need to right this ship before it hits the iceberg that's straight ahead.
---
As a level 110, honestly, I have never run across a 3* despite the numerous SBQ/nukes/events I have done. I am so jelly (jealous). LOL. I am still rockin an all rise, bloodied lever rifle, and some type of gauss gun...can't remember the name of it...all three are 1*! But, I like to earn my way so I keep grinding away at the tasks. When I did the event, it didn't drop a gun for me. Just a plan, a couple stimpaks, and something else I can't remember what. I was pissed. Took us 2 hours because the 13 yr old was being a bit of a bugger LOL. Then we had to,server hop to get the event and the child quit. Lol. He's like, I'm going to bed it's 9pm. Yeah, uh-huh. Whatever. Lol. But I was glad to have gotten the event done one time with only dying once. Auto stim is lovely. Lol.
---
I just started a new character with a completely different (stealth pistol and unarmed) build and now that i know what perks i should actually pick and what places to visit its been much more fun than with my lvl 260 bloodied commando build.
---
You can still repair your crap at any bench. Jesus Christ people. 
---
They said cosmetic. It may have been a bad word choice, but Christ, people are way over-reacting about this crap. 
---
You can even get repair kits from SBQ, it sounds like.
---
The hunt wasn't even started we were waiting for players
---
I activate the pylon then jump on top of the shed. Continual hits with diluted stims keep me up. Last event I did this and some guy in power armor jumped up there and practically stood over me as I crouched and my first thought was that he was pissed at me thinking I was sitting out the fight, then I realized he was protecting me as best as he could from all of the gutsies etc. Bless that buckethead, I stayed alive a good long while. More people need to do this. Protect your pylon conduits!
---
Thank you! I’ll check it out myself tomorrow, should be fun.
---
Btw on one of the podiums in Helvetia its speaks of a sermon about "The Harvester" haven't seen any other mention of it anywhere so it could be an important clue or just crazy ramblings.
---
I have hydraulic bracers, tenderizer, bloody mess and adrenaline. Like I said, as far as I can tell, it seems to be a set amount of damage. I wish it wasn't, because I was going for a tank support build, but this game doesn't provide much in the way of that.
---
Yeah, I would like a third version called roleplaying or something. That would be where we who care more about immersion could go. I would love it if there were no legendary items at all in that play mode. You could use your character with the same weapons and armor but all legendary effects were supressed and you couldn't get any legendaries. It would limit the meta game and people could actually interact and immerse themselves in the world instead of just hunting for stuff.
---
Eyebots have them
---
What he's suggesting is that the 3* Legendaries should be an absolute guaranteed drop from this "boss".
---
Same,maybe it'll reset the challenge
---
Good luck on the hunt friend, I'm currently following a note found on a body found in Helvetia.
---
Yeah, I saw that one too! I think they’re either some weird splinter faction of the Mothman cult or they’re some other cult entirely.
---
The Harvester or something else?
---
The sub reddit regularly loses their shit over absolutely meaningless stuff because the vocal
---
minority only plays the game as a form of video game hate-fucking. 
---
The game exists in a sphere that only exists for a select group of players to get angry about and loudly rant about. 
---
The vocal community do not speak for all players, and are likely a very vocal minority in all reality.
---
So far, my experience has involved level 100+ PA build characters standing around demanding that the lower levels "make themselves useful and turn on the pylons, so they can kill it" while said lower levels get rip to shreads by the Gutsy's that show up.
---
There needs to be players manning the pylons and avoiding the sheep, players who can damage said sheep and players who can keep the Gutsy number down enough that those manning the pylons don't die repeatedly.
---
I also always become a Conduit for the stupid pylons, which doesn't end after the event and eventually leads to my game freezing(but compared to the lack of cooperation, this is a minor issue).
---
Don't know the note was telling some reavers to head south to Summersville but the 'handwriting' looked odd.
---
Could be a dead lead but I enjoy the hunt.
---
Yeah, it's really stupid that it takes so long to start an event that's basically the last part of a questline.
---
Oh cry me a fucking river, that’s on you for not knowing ahead of time that they were shutting down the servers.
---
Sorry about that Mr Infuse I will.
---
Ooh! Intriguing. Good look on your hunt as well! Perhaps you will find more cult weirdness. But it could just as easily be nothing. Only time and adventure will tell!
---
If you are mad about a company just wanting your money I have some bad news. 
---
You’re not Bethesda’s mommy.
---
I think you said it wrong. It's "We have the technology, we can rebuild him... but we don't want to spend alot of money." 😆
---
Exactly.👍
---
This tho. 🤣
---
Slippery Slope is a logical fallacy and not a justifiable argument.
---
I died like five times and gave up once because no one was coming to help me and my game froze on the respawn screen. The camera would just float around me in a circle not allowing me to do anything, all the controls were locked. I had to exit out of the game only to finally get back to the same server with the event completed already. (I figured out too late that the Xbox shows who you were recently playing with even if you aren't they're friends and you can just jump back into the same server you were on by joining them.)
---
All my junk was lost, which I shouldn't have brought to the battle in the first place, and I couldn't loot any of the legendaries I got a shot on.
---
If I had to switch perks just to eat every time I needed to I’d lose my mind
---
I just remembered in the camp building plans for the mounted heads.
---
There is a Mothman. And he is glorious.
---
The masks were mentioned before the game even came out.
---
It's all very nice about exploring, but when you know every cap stash, every monster spawnpoint and know where you need to go for every plant you want it's not exploring. It's grinding. It's also boring as hell. Having the ability to plant some of those in your CAMP let's you concentrate on more fun stuff.
---
To infinity... and beyond!
---
What’s that about your mommy giving you baths still?
---
Kinda glad I haven't ran into any trap builds yet. I do run across allot of locked builds that I don't understand. Why build if no one is going to see it. I love to build I always feel the budget is too low lol. Mind you I'm not 50 yet so I'm working with a level 30 budget but I have a nice little store with a loft above and a garage with all the work stations and 2 stashes at the white springs driving range. I'm just waiting for player vending to open up shop. Lol and level 50 for more build room.
---
Not just three star legendaries, it needs a *specific list* of three star legendaries.
---
Did your mommy make you breakfast too? Cuckhold.
---
Jesus. Yes. 
---
I had a never-ending fucking mob of scorched last week. I had to literally kite the stupid robot down the road to stop the flood. 
---
Then an almost identical mob of liberators a day or two later.
---
That and you can always scroll through a gallery before you buy anything. There is a video of the person setting off the statue and it is clearly bigger than them.
---
WHAT?!?!
---
*insert furious cultist gibberish about harming our gods, but then muttering something about Scorched Mothman and calming down*
---
Now I have another thing to look for! I’ve never encountered a Mothman that didn’t vanish mysteriously the moment I fired at it, so I’ll probably never mount it, but still, intrigued.
---
And where did it state that today one of the many servers will be shutting down they do not notify you when one is being switched off they only request you switch servers
---
I'm sorry to see this game is full of toxic people who only post trash when somebody posts somthing they dont agree with until it happens to them
---
Thanks. Lucky i bought the plan for the T-60 ,but now to get the extra flux and that is not easy.
---
I just wish being high level actually ment something. My weapons are shit, my armor is shit, my talents are mediocre and it takes me 5 shits to kill a freaking ghoul. I am level 178
---
IIRC, I found mine in one of the frat houses.
---
Yeah, it's the same for can do and the ammo one too. I went for my first 25 levels without realizing why they didn't seem to work.
---
You have a lot of luck then. He usually asks me to drink something (even those hard to brew) and then kill somthing and then gives me the same recepie that I already know over and over again. There's loads of recepies I don't know.
---
Well, that is the spawn point just south down the road from Abbie's bunker by the look of it, and yes, sometimes that spawn point decided to go full bonkers on you. Happened to me twice at the same spot. They didn't enjoy ganging up on me after I equipped the "Last Laugh" perk and some high powered grenades.
---
I came up on an INCREDIBLE vampire's/swing speed/+1 str sledgehammer yesterday after doing a horde event in Toxic Valley.  Only downside is it was lvl 10.  I was like awesome, gonna save this for my melee guy when legendary prestige reset comes around and I'll steamroll my way to level 20.  My stash is 792/800 and the hammer weighs 12, and my melee guy's stash is also nearly maxed out.  I haven't made a mule yet, but I definitely will tomorrow.
---
I popped a spiked rocket mod on it at camp (thank you treasure maps for strange, great, random plans), opened the map, ported to a random lvl 14 in Morgantown who was beating up scorched at the airport with a baseball bat and just dropped it in a bag for them while giving them the "come here" emote.  The guy actually got on his mic to say "what do you want for this?"  Nothing dude, I just got lucky and now you are.  He wouldn't take no for an answer, so I accepted a couple dozen .45 rounds and a shadowed leather leg plan that I somehow never found.  Considering that my character is a sniper, I felt like I got the better end of the deal.  I just really hope he doesn't toss that hammer when he hits lvl 20.  It's a monster of a drop.  I also got [this white whale](https://imgur.com/7cXTTsp) from different horde events a ways back that I loaned out to a friend while she was bringing up a sniper alt.  She classified it as "I felt like a filthy cheater" when she gave it back at lvl 50-ish.
---
DO IT
---
Loading in is also taking longer. To the point scorchbeasts are attacking before i can defend myself.
---
Equal value? I got 5 boiled waters, we can trade...
---
Oh boy, the stalking Mothman are annoying because they just fly away, but the vengeful Mothman? He fights like the Scorchbeast wishes it could. The glowing ones look cool as fuck.
---

On a side note people on imgur love downvoting fallout 76 stuff. All those pics i put up in tje last ten or so minutes have been downvoted 😂
---
The playonline browser is a special hell from a bygone era.
---
You wait until your character is literally starving and then you switch, you quickly get used to it and you don't waste your perks points that way (Which is really useful once you've reached end-game).
---
I will say it didn't reset it for me. At least not yet.
---
For my "mobile CAMP" character, I use a 2x2 with a small loft.  Pretty cozy (cramped) but has everything I need with minimal space.  
---
Fusion Generator rug glitched under the stairway platform, weapon, armor, tinker, brewing and chem stations downstairs.  Bed, guitar and cooking put upstairs. Power armor station goes outside on the ground.  Wiring set up with external connectors at both ends to easily wire up water purifiers and vending machine (when that comes).  Still has loads of budget left and could use some more decoration but I don't spend a lot of time on this character and I'm anticipating adding a bunch of junk decoration once that becomes available.

Bethesda doesn't know how to multiplayer,that's why we have this shitty leveling system.There should be a cap.Levels should be progressively harder to achieve and levels should then incur some benefit to your character.This is how you multiplayer.
---
It is pretty fun, but you have to reload each bolt individually, unlike my quad harpoon gun which reloads all 4 at once.
---
Thanks for the harvesting and crafting info i have only been focusing on fire power.
---
Ouch.
---
I’m glad it’s not just me, can’t do pocket mod onto scout armour - XBO
---
Oh god your right it IS glorious! Thank you for sharing all this wonderful Mothman goodness with me! 
---
And yes, people do seem to do that. I’ve had that experience in the past when I’d post my Fallout 4 settlements (where, ironically enough since we are discussing a Mothman cult, I made a cult to Liberty Prime.) and my recent CAMP post. I doubt they’ve ever played, they just “drink the Kool-Aid” of negative reviews.
---
Not gonna lie I wish she did, man. But she lives in her own home so my girlfriend usually cooks me breakfast, what about you?
---
100% agree!
---
Yeah, it's the same stupid issue. This was a really weird design decision.
---
What can you do when the Scorched Beast has the high ground?
---
Well, looks like you still have a fallout76custom.ini file, that is what should be causing that. Won't be enough to remove the mods, the .ini has to go as well. or just update it. It is not in the same directory as the mods.
---
I've been chowing a Rad Scorpion steak to help with energy damage. I need to craft some other edibles too but it's easy to find Scorpions.
---
Same with the stash boxes. I was used to pressing X, and then the right button (or right trigger button) to scroll to the type of item I need. Just muscle memory. And as a result I keep lobbing plasma grenades inside the Armory at Whitespring because whichever right button I press is the one that lobs grenades. So one day, I know some tank will be standing at the workbench just next to the stash, I'll accidentally grenade him, and then he'll one-shot me in revenge.
---
Thanks, Bethesda.
---
Lot of plastic yesterday night, so not removed
---
No problem, I love to spread the Word of Mothman.
---
If you haven't already there are some amazing documentaries on the RL Mothman. Like did you know skeptics told people the sightings of Mothman RL we're just large Virginia owls or albino owls?
---
I'm of the belief that BGS made the in-game Mothman look like he does to reflect this.
---
The Fasnacht owl mask is the biggest piece that led me to believe that 
---

---
are you on ps4?   had not mentioned my system
---
Oh well, maybe in team with team perks, marsupial etc
---
lvl 268 for my main, 130 my second... I understand...
---
seems like you are on pc
---
oof NICE thats what I wanted tbh
---
nah mate, pc i mentioned it before, sorry.
---
Packs don’t stop at level 50. You get one every 5 levels.
---
Diseases from diseased creatures seem to ignore how much END you have as well as the Vaccinated perk and Antibiotics.  In short, they are bugged and have been since release.  19 of the 22 diseases are from creatures as well.
---
Some of the diseases are already pretty sever, especially by themeselves, such as: Blood Worms, Bone Worms, Rad Worms, Glowing Pustules, Shell Shock, Weeping Sores and Sludge Lung.
---
Dysentry and Parasites wouldn't be an issue if water &amp; food loss over time wasn't still already an issue and Speed Demon wasn't such a popular mutation.
---
The rest however, could benefit from being 2x as severe, especially the SPECIAL ones.
---
Despite that, they don't need to decrease the chance of infection, just fix the bugs with creature based diseases.
---
And while they are at it, they can change Plague Walker to keep the diseases(as in they are permenent while you have Plague Walker).
---
Does being grounded help with the damage from being a conduit?
---
I've had to activate 2 or 3 of the pylons cause no 1 else will then I end up going down giving them another 20 seconds to do damage and when I respawned they have done fuck all damage it's pissing me off how people can't understand what to do.
---
is the fact that i saw the materials needed to craft (without having the right plans) also due to a bug?   very misleading that i could see everything needed (the stuff that i have and still need)  to craft these shocks
---
Do you play on pc or ps4?
---
Wow. That’s quite clever! And good job spotting it! I’ve never seen any documentaries, but I have a book (the title of which escapes me at the moment) which I’m pretty sure includes him. Interestingly, there was supposedly a Mothman at Chernobyl as well! Don’t have the book here in my dorm, or I’d send pics of the pages referencing it.
---
NV takes place between 3 and 4.
---
It's not just maintenance the problem is not being put back on the same server after some random disconnect or crash to desktop that this game is riddled with. I think Bethesda needs to have a rejoin previous server option if the server is still up. That would make setting up workshops allot more useful.
---
Btw don't let the trolls get to you just feel sorry for them and move on.
---
Would you recommend getting it? I was thinking of getting but I’m 100 atoms away from getting it. The only reason why I’m sort of hesitant is because I’m worried there might be a cool power armor paint that might release that will be limited time only. I run a BOS clan so would you think the statue might work out with my camp?
---
Even reports of him being seen on 9/11 where tje twin towers got hit.
---
Crazy shit man. If you remember the title let me know I'll have to look into it.
---
I would to have be reaaaaally drunk before facing that thing alone. Fantastic piece of art.
---
When I was level 14 I got dangerously close to whitesprings,and next thing I know I was being bombarded by hordes of charred ghouls. I remember going down, before a level 182 flew in from the sky with a jetpack, before blasting the ghouls to hell with a missile launcher, then mowing down the rest like radroaches with a gatling laser. He gave me some stuns after reviving me, and even hit me with a level 15 legendary he had. Great guy and totally badass.
---
Hmm. Interesting! 
---
I think it was one of the books in a non-fiction series called Lore, about various things. I’ll check next time I go to my favorite coffee shop, cause I know they have one of the books there, from the same series.
---
Oh your mom made me breakfast. Tell her to wash a bit better next time cuz that shit was rank.
---
Cool, thanks👍
---
Being a stealth player, I feel that we make the best conduits. I have marsupial so I can jump on to the pylon out of danger and you stay in "caution" or sometimes even go to "hidden" and get the stealth damage buffs to clean up all the gutsies in one shot and let the heavies clean up he squatch. Just had First Aid equipped to get the most from my stims and watched my health. If you have healing factor and get a chance to be full hidden sonit activates, well, thats just gravy for a conduit person.
---
Gaining caps is much easier now that they have increased the robot vendor caps limit to 1400.  
---
Grab everything, scrap at a station, store in stash, then bulk everything to sell as much as you don't want to keep. (I currently keep about 8 bulk of each item, but even 5 or 6 is a good amount)  
---
I take the time to sell any excess bulk items every time I log-in.
---
High ones that?
---
That would be pretty bad ass
---
Deactivating pylons should weaken or deactivate the fifty gutsies that are spamming you with lasers.
---
It's missing for me, too. I gathered all the ingredients and made the nukashine, but it still didn't complete. It's not even listed under my quests now.
---
Ayy, great minds think alike (but fools rarely differ)
---
Loose mods currently aren't working for weapons,PA and armor.
---
I believe that Beth is aware of it but don't quote me.
---
Remember level 50 is technically the max so a level 150 guy is not as strong as you might think. The only thing the high levels mean is just they've been playing longer so have a higher chance of having good equipment
---
Should be an achievement for server hoping 760 times. I have a feeling a lot of people would already have it.
---
Get a missle launcher and a targeting chip mod. Also a sniper rifle works shoot the propellers to cripple it and it'll stay in one spot. 
---
You can also buy them relatively cheaply on here.
---
I got a fucking rolling pin from him
---
I use Perfect Storm on the fireflies. They burn as they go down, and it really helps to spot where they land.
---
The sad reality is that they aren’t gonna get any easier because they want us ultimately to be spending money to get atoms.
---
Google to the rescue! It’s The World Of Lore: Monstrous Creatures. I’ll take pics of the pages next time I’m at the shop, probably this weekend.
---
I finally killed the flatwoods monster last week, just checked now &amp; it is still ticked as completed 8/8 but sheepsquatch is unlocked.
---
Hell I just finished the quest " Belly of the beast" had to go in the glass Cavern. I was in deep and there was 2 SB above. As they passed overhead and screamed for someone else over me I would get all the scorched guys attacking underground they all appear next to me. And I would get the acid hit me. How in the world can the SB hit me and the Scorched even find me. I had 15 scorched guys everytime appearing next to me. I think the guy finally killed one but he then left. I was still getting the scorched because Bots ended up there. I could hear them. Does that make any sense???? What the hell fix this Bethesda
---
No man, don't stop. I will hence forth always call my ultracite PA ultracute. Thank you.
---
That is the exact same thing that happened to me. It is very frustrating.
---
Because Just having END also decreases your chance of getting a disease.  15 END decreases the chance by 80%; however, creature based diseases haven't been affected by this since the beta.
---
So with both 15 END and Vaccinated 3 you would have a 100 \* 0.2(END) \* 0.1(Vaccinated 3) chance of being infected, or a 2% chance.  With antibiotics that would be lowered to 1% chance.  With food, disease chance can go below 1%(as in a decimal) but it can't be fully negated without either Carnivore or Herbivore.
---
Hmm, it's not too expensive on Amazon...looks like I'm picking up a copy!
---
Yeh they can be a right pain, what platform?
---
get your dirty virgin ass outta here and go find something to do LMAO
---
It’s not just Mothman, it covers lots of stuff. Pretty neat series. Hope you enjoy!
---
Based on Bethesda's history to fix games I wouldn't hold my breath. They are already focusing to create new broken games. Their business model is to create as cheap games as possible and then invest heavily to marketing to create big hype with videos etc. Customers will get broken games and Bethesda just delivers minimum fixes to avoid lawsuits.
---
That's great i wasnt sure how community events would work. How did you guys all get on the same server?
---
That's good to know, than Ill just try again.
---
AHAHAHA Because the “fame” you have on Reddit means anything. You idiot. Now I know I’m dealing with an ignorant moron who thinks that he’s important because he jerks off to crap on the internet. God forbid an actual war starts and you have to go outside. You’d be the first to go cuck. Enjoy douche nozzle.
---
It wasn't that bad a penalty, even on survivor.
---
I said by many, not officially, as OP has had conflicted feedback. I was explaining that potential conflict. 
---
Tactics was part of the purchase originally by Beth so where is the receipt for that being not canon. I really don’t care what is or isn’t official as I’ve been playing the franchise since launch and have a very personal attachment to it. But I’m sick of all this anal “lore lore lore retcon retcon retcon” crap. Ultimately OP, it doesn’t matter, go with whatever you want, because whatever you say, some smart ass will always contradict you because that’s the internet. 
---
I’ve been a part of Fallout communities online since the early 2000s and the same arguments have been going on since then. Interplay killed Fallout according to NMA, no, no wait... apparently it was still alive a bit, because it’s official that Bethesda have killed it. Let’s hope no one else buys the franchise after Beth because nobody likes Nectophilia! /s
---
Is there some catacomb somewhere full of the Holy Tomes of Lore, curated by the Incel Monks of Lore? Which social network do they post their holy decrees to because apparently I’m not on it.
---
In all my many thousands of hours in Bethesda RPG's, this has literally never happened to me and I've never heard of it happening to anybody else in all my modding adventures. I feel it necessary to make this point: your experience seems very exceptional.
---
The amount of boiled water you need for recipes these days you'd be getting robbed.
---
A Wattz 2000 laser rifle skin would also be nice.
---
I’ll drop loot in suitcases or dead bodies near lowbies, v76 the still south of v76, the overseers camp if I’m close or train stations 
---
Just trying to pay it forward.
---
Ooh fun! But you know what you did. It knows you ate the eggs. It wants revenge. And it will get revenge by eating all your clothes, eating all your blankets and sheets, and then eating you. 
---
Or it will just Watch you ceaselessly, constantly Watching you. Always Watching.
---
Is great that your enjoying it. Most people just think ‘“oh YouTuber x said it’s bad so it must be bad” but yeah it has loads of potential. And NPCs are leaked to come this year
---
*raises hand*
---
Never thought about the targeting chip for a missile  launcher. Ive got a two shot sitting in my stash. I wonder if both missiles are guided or just one.
---
Fr? Thats gonna be awesome lol
---
Nah, creature based diseases are just bugged.  15 END + Vaccinated 3 + Antibiotics and I still get diseases from creatures in one hit(someties even without being hit).
---
what actually happens when you buy atoms?
---
do you have to enter your cc details into the client? webpage?
---
and can you make it forget your details, or will it remember?
---
My face may have fallen into some of those tasty moth babies. Or I may have sold the babies to various vendors.....we can't be sure....
---
I wouldn't call it a "bad" game, it just isn't what people expected out of it. I played for a bit and had a good time with some friends but after my friends stopped playing the game died a little to me.
---
Sprinting away to dense forests always worked for me, I.e. breaking line of sight and not making it obvious where you went. People never notice how organic and natural the mob AI is in Bethesda games. Do this and occasionally check their alertness via sneaking; you'll see that they break off pretty quick (go from Danger to Caution) but they continue to remain in that "searching" mode for quite a while.
---
Custom flags! Allow users to create flags for they're faction. Also, would love to see a player faction system, where your faction is displayed on the map next to your GT.
---
"Leaked” or “suspected”?
---
I haven’t actually seen any evidence. Can you provide a link please?
---
I had one drop the crate on top of a tree the other day. Couldn’t even Marsupial Jetpack my ass high enough to get it 😂
---
Hatted them till I hit 50 and finally was able to start taking them on.  I hunted them  and enjoyed the days of killing 8-12 on my way to or back from Watoga.  Hit 100 and they just fly by and leave me alone now and I usually ignore them as well.  I loved the days they came out of the fissure 2 at a time but that stopped when I hit 100 and since I have a good stash of Ultracite I don't really go out of my way to get more.  Anyway it does get better those low level days are hard though unless you luck out and get a good drop of armor or weapons.  Keep an eye to the sky and keep on grinding soon they will be more of a minor issue when your in a rush .
---
Deposits? What do they look like, I dont think I've ever seen or used a deposit
---
No, it's not "follow range" - the AI isn't that simple. See my reply above about how to properly break it, rather than trying to cheese it by thinking the AI is basic like most other games.
---
It most likely involved a squad and running away.
---
Just punch them dude, they die in one hit with nothing equipped
---
I was in your shoes many moons ago.
---
All I had to my name was an All Rise, which is fantastic don't get me wrong but it did not intimidate the cargobot one bit.
---
I cheesed my first nuke card with the assistance of my bot army. I am after all the major of Watoga am I not?
---
Go forth protections! Take down that irritating spinney-thingy!
---
Yeah I can see where that issue is
---
Wise Mothman is sure. Wise Mothman is Wise. Until he is Vengeful, of course.
---
Don’t buy it, textures on such big items are very low and it’s really hard to illuminate. I use streetlight but it looks super ugly
---
its not, don't believe the neg hype.. people just need something to complain about
---
I’ll try ! Thanks for the tip
---
You should stop playing this game and go play something else.
---
What does a targeting chip do?
---
I havntn played in awhile, does this mean there are a ton of new players, or does this mean allot of people stopped playing?
---
I'm having the same issue. I have all the required perks to put the mod on as well.
---
I yeeted his corpse to the sky with my auto grenade launcher yesterday on accident. Thankfully I found the body before I was crucified.
---
It's not Bethesda/76 branded, but the actual Mothman museum website sells Mothman plushies! And t-shirts, and posters, and drinking glasses...
---
Yeah like the employee at my local game store was trying so hard to talk me out of it. Eventually I had to get a little loud telling him to just ring the damn thibg up
---
*bots
---
Yes. The top hat used to be 1 cloth to make and sell for ~32. Now it’s 3 cloth and 1 leather to make and sells for ~14. Other apparel were similarly affected.
---
The #1 reason for people's complaints about AI in the game, after known bugs ofc, is simply their ignorance and trying to play the game with preconceptions of other typical games that have relatively inferior AI.
---
It's an open-world game, there are going to be enemies that are simply to tough for you - until you're end-game. Learn to run away. Or just server-hop if you're lazy and fed up.
---
And when you run away, don't just try to "run outside the agro range leash" - this is not an MMORPG, the AI is way more sophisticated and don't just break pursuit instantly, they'll continue to search and only give up after a short time or if a new threat comes along.
---
It's Sierra Bravo Bravo Sierra
---
I get that it would be a nice touch, and well within possibility to get this feature,  but in what sense is it "so needed"?
---
Not saying it is a bad suggestion but there are other features that I find is needed more urgent.
---
OMFG, I would so buy armor like that. Hell, I would pay DOUBLE.
---
I saw that in my search. However that being said it's not the brand name I care for. The Bethesda model is adorable. My kids would love it. That being said it will be mine.
---
I don’t get all the comments to not buy this. [DEFINITELY buy this, the explosion is awesome!](https://youtu.be/gzd2ifDDKQw)
---
There is a perk about that.
---
Why? I rarely need to worry about a disease...  I just let them play out.
---
Awesome advice re: killing accompanying scorched. Thanks. Had no idea.
---
Nah. You just need to be more mindful of what is around you and kill diseased creatures from a distance before they can get all up in your business.
---
It’s down to personal preference. I don’t like statues that big, i much prefer small decorations to scatter all around my camp. Plus, textures are low res, as usual, and it’s hard to illuminate in a decent manner
---
So after powering up posiden heres what you need to do . Put a pylon down next to the core processor, then from the pylon attach a wire to the processor. It will start up, it doesn't recognize that it's already hooked up until you attach another wire to it.
---
It's year 2102. Feminist, green peace and other factions banned using animals for clothing......
---
Yes it’s a problem/bug that was introduced with a recent patch...
---
That's the universe telling you that you are playing this game too much and need to find another hobby.
---
I'd be happy if they just fixed all the bugs with power switches.
---
Oh nice. Someone that not got brainwashed by influencers and plays the follower. Nice to have you here,    
---
freethinker \^o\^
---
Good to be here
---
I am built to chew through gutsy's and as a conduit, but do I have ge at least one shot on the imposter to get her loot? I think you get bupkiss if you don't hit her at all...
---
One from tones nighmares of this game. Even with ranged build it can be pain.
---
I can help if you want
---
I’ve actually had the opposite experience. I’m primarily a solo player and have made 2 new characters so far for screwing around in Survival mode. With the PvP damage balancing in place I’ve been able to kill most higher level players trying to gank me with basic weapons like automatic pipe rifles or 10mm pistols.
---
Adding targeting HUD to power armor helmet not makes it visible?
---
I agree with this post.
---
Maybe you'll have some better luck now that the riots have calmed down a little bit.  Seems to be mostly people complaining about caps invested vs. the lack of loot in the new event now.
---
They're that heavy? I carried like 10 when I was low level lol
---
But all the factions are dead it’s now you and your fellow vault dwellers so they don’t have to follow the rules of the different factions
---
The only people who are frustrated are the shitty grindlords chasing 1337 purpz. That actually makes the rest of us really happy because everyone else hates you.
---
I am level 204 and 8lvl guy two shot me with shotgun. Don't be lame and you can play survival whatever on level you are.
---
You do have to land like 1 hit, but if you hit it while it while the pylons are powering up, you still get kill credit at the end of the event.
---
&gt;When did server hopping become a horrible taboo or something that is so GRUELING to do that people have to be this upset about it?
---
 Are you seriously defending this? Server hopping is a horrible game mechanic.
---
Bugs with power switches?
---
That’s not the same as microtransaction currency not being available due to cryptocurrency regulation.
---
If he Konami issue is why Bethesda hasn’t made buying Atom available in Japan, then it’s not because of crypto regulation, it’s because Bethesda is actively deciding against implementing currency expiration for a specific market.
---
True, it’s personal preference. I have a shop camp with a vendor window. I sit on one side of that window and the customers are on the other side. On the customers side, next to them are a mothman statue and one of these hero statues, which I can activate from my side. It’s been great to scare the shit out people or to draw them into the store (but they usually just go running)
---
But this didn't happen before…
---
I am having the same problem with attaching an automatic barrel mod to my Tesla rifle.
---
I've yet to run into a single disease that I felt was even worth the effort to cure. The effects are just so mild.
---
Well I’m on the fence with it. I think the effect is pretty cool. Also isn’t the statue suppose to have that texture?
---
Glad to have you mate ... =)
---
A sucker is born every day. 🍭🍭🍭
---
Good good
---
If you’re on pc I can give you ammo, craft some weapons etc .
---
JesterSymbiote is my IGN. I be online after work in about 4 hours
---
I just imagined a guy in brown power armor sprinting straight at me screaming “**WHAT CAN BROWN DO FOR YOU?**
---
Yeah, if they fix the resistance to it and increase the severity of the diseases I’d be happy. At the moment I get them and honestly just ignore them because they’re just a minor nuisance. 
---
Overall though it detracts from the game because you constantly have it but also because there’s no real dire need to fix it. 
---
I’d love to see more severe diseases and regional diseases so I could finally make use of the regional cures.
---
Also the water and food loss/food decay rate increased dramatically in the same patch, not just for speed demon. I noticed this and the diseases around the same time since it happened when I was building my CAMP. The Camp Fire Perk and other camp based or disease resistance perks did nothing. 
---
I actually had to stop playing at one point because I was eating soup every 5-10 minutes or catching a disease which added to the hunger/thirst so I was downing soup and purified water every 5 mins.
---
Yes, I meant that it doesn’t look like a 1080p texture. It’s rough in some points, and looks awful at night illuminated by artificial light
---
Meanwhile Anthem is a thousand times worse off than this. 7 Days to Die *wishes* it was this game and its sold over a million copies.
---
The premise is fair I hope. Let Coop people coop, discourage PvP there, encourage competetive gameplay in mode where you accept the risk when you enter the server.
---
🎯
---
Ah that explains why I can't put the additional claw on my DeathClaw Gauntlet
---
A guy was on the mic the other day telling people to activate the pylons when they were near it [he activated them too]
---
One guy who just kept shooting it without the shield down gets on the mic and says "dude shut up. We hear you"
---
Apparently the fuck not! We didn't kill it because NO ONE activated anything except me and the other guy
---
Or be able to collect the water from the fountain for later use
---
The Helvetia note didn't lead to anything of note or cultishness.
---
Forest looks like the Cranberry Bog .
---
That’s somewhat disappointing.
---
There’s just a Radstag Hide Outfit so far
---
I actually think it’s pretty good . Just wish we had preset perk layouts
---
They can be very fickle *tsk tsk*
---
At one point I had all 3 and was spamming stims and unfortunately that’s just not realistic, especially with the regeneration of a 3 star enemy. It’s a great idea for a challenge, but the fact that people are being dicks about it is ridiculous. 
---
During the parade everyone was dying to participate... where’s that energy?
---
I'm over Lv 250 and a lv 1 could probs kill me with a pipe gun if they get the first shot in when I'm running a bloodied build and have less than 10% hp... but anyone's in trouble if I see them first ha!
---
Rainbow colored with flowers and cute ribbons and wherever you go you spawn little kittens .
---
And the jet pack could shoot out rose pedals.
---
But to be serious , no there isn’t a jet pack for the ultracite, wished it existed and for excavator
---
Yeah😞 but I'm sure there will be more!
---
Basically locks on target. The missle follows the bot
---
ITT: PEBKAC blames the developers again. News @ 11
---
I sacrifice health so I get a 20% damage buff from nerd rage,50-60% from  adrenal reaction and plus 5 strength from radicool. The down side is Im aways at 20-30% health with the rest being rads.
---
I’m sure you can maybe find a good light. Maybe put it right in front of your camp with a platform. Unless you tried everything to look less ugly. But I still have to admit it’s pretty cool!
---
But do not underestimate the bots power
---
All bethesda had to do, is cap bottlecap stacking  at level 50. Losing 100 caps is ok, getting 100caps is nice. Being 200 level was pain. Now it is still not fair, cause i have to kill 5people to get caps i lose on 1death. Also it is not worth hunt people for caps.
---
I'm not sure what, or whom, this post is directed at exactly, but thank you for your explaination. Like I said, I don't know the background, story, lore or whatever, I was just curious as to the chronological order. I suppose I could have simply looked online and figured it all out myself, but I was kindda hoping to get a little feedback into the story as well by posting here.
---
You said you've been playing since the beginning, right? So in your opinion, are the 2 spinoffs and NV canon to the story as well?
---
I imagine cult/Mothman stuff is fairly frequently requested, so, hopefully there will be more!
---
Fun with Flags, tamed deathclaw edition
---
Odd... Bots never attack Mothman for me.
---
i think its just that people dont want to take free damage and risk death, so people get life greedy i guess XD which is why i made this post, so we can all make it out alive.
---
Here's to hoping😊 good luck fellow cultist.
---
I just got to level 35 and killed my first one a couple of days ago at Whitespring.  Having and being able to use decent weapons makes a huge difference.  Gatling plasma and Excavator PA ftw.
---
&gt;Suddenly its taking upwards of a minute to put my camp fully into the game on login.
---
I think it's more of the fact the player gets loaded into the game earlier than before.
---
Too many people were complaining about getting attacked while loading into the game. The game would load everything first, player near last.
---
Now they fixed that by loading the player first. It's not taking longer for your base to load, you are just loaded ingame earlier so it seems that way.
---
Just my observation.
---
I mostly ignored the caps factor as I have my greatest fun of trying to take down organised groups of powerful enemies. Doesn't matter how good you are, you'll die sometimes. Sometimes a lot :)
---
If bugs had power switches, you could just turn them off
---
I was there last night. Plenty of plastic and a super mutant legendary. Probably looted before you showed up.
---
I always drop my excess plans either at Flatwoods into the Overseer Cache, or in Watoga into the Suitcase at the Train Station
---
I'm not going anywhere, was just letting you know where to find the info about the private servers work that is ongoing. Not going to make an entire subreddit just for a private server mod , especially before it is even released.
---
Can't attach shotgun mod to my tesla rifle, it's literally unattainable now.
---
It just seems dumb, because they’re wasting time and ammo, plus risking (guaranteeing) failing the event. Plus if you store your junk before the event there’s literally no repercussion  to dying, you spawn right back in to the battle. 
---
People who spam the sheep when they KNOW they aren’t causing damage, it’s just wild. I’m glad you made the post but the game makes it pretty clear what needs to be done by flashing it across the screen, and people still aren’t doing it, it’s baffling.  Hopefully people figure it out soon!
---
I was a little frustrated at the time too, sinking 1000 rounds into a bullet sponge.  Now I can spend maybe 10 rounds with a god-roll gun to take one out.  I'm not a better player than anyone else, I just have a stick-to-it attitude and try to learn from failure.  Being diligent and willing to work helps tremendously.  So many players complain about shitty legendary drops but if you keep plugging away, eventually your luck will turn around and you'll win the lottery.  If you make some friends that are doing the same thing, your odds increase dramatically of finding that perfect weapon that someone else can use.  Then they use that weapon to make it easier to find your own perfect piece and the odds start stacking slightly in your favor until you can do a silo run, alert a half dozen end-game monsters in your discord channel to join your sever because you're gonna launch a nuke on whitesprings in 5 minutes  and it becomes a 3-star weapon/armor trading session afterwards.  If everyone on my discord group was on at the same time, the entire server would just be friends and I might start to feel sorry for the enemies.  (we've had 6 of us at SBQ together and killed her in maybe 2-3 minutes) If you're willing to start climbing the mountain, reaching the peak is very sweet.  The next mountain climb will be easier with the experience and gear you earned from the initial climb that you started with nothing, just like everyone else.
---
If wolf can hide a fucking 13 pound shotgun from policemen in plain sight, we can assume he's been watching us all along.
---
Also Im not even done with my build, I should be doing around 700 onene um done. add max adrenaline perk and I should be doing 1k
---
It would be way to hard for bethesda to code that. (I think at least. I don't know a whole lot of coding)
---
Just remember the people who say it doesn't have any story are to lazy to read, to dumb to look at the environment or lack imagination to come up with their own theory of what happened when they find something. :)
---
I miss the spoilers because I close the app after the first dozen whining “Bethesda neeeeeeeds to” posts.
---
The flatwoods is a zetan. If you cripple his thrusters you can see little deformed alien legs, showing he's some disabled zetan subspecies.
---
Agreed.
---
I’ve noticed the disconnects are always related to specific things. It always happens when I launch a nuke, capture a workshop, or I do specific events. 
---
Whatever it actually is it still happens at least once in an hour play through.
---
Just jump up and around like a marsupial sheep with stims. The fake can't really hit you effectively even when you are a pylon :)
---
Before patch i had one not so good experience. I fast traveled to powerplant event, there were two guys. They killed me seconds after i leaved event (lost zero caps because guy gave me bounty before). So i was like, ok lets fight and respawned there again, hiden, get to them from behind, killed one guy. Shot other guy in power armor 5+ times with gaus that will put you down on 2shots. No damage was done to him. Then he killed me. I was like, what the fuck? So i tryed again. With same result, this guy was immortal. Some glitch with event or idk. Because of this i lost 800 caps. That's alot to lose. Now you don't lose so much, but also you get near to nothing. Yeah you can murder people for fun, thats not so motivating tho.
---
I love this sub
---
Nah, scorched are a faction so, once you're a scorched, you are agro to even your own
---
It can be infuriating.  I’m wondering if Bethesda increased the legendary creature rate but didn’t do anything to adjust the drops 
---
No sure
---
Once I was lvl 21, hanging out with my lvl 15 friend and lvl 81 friend. We we're at one of those train stations that has the stash box and my higher level friend got a lvl 100+ scorch beast to spawn as he fast traveled away. My friend who was lvl 15 was on top of the stash taking no damage, while I was burning alive in the main area. I eventually died and the scorch beast left my friend alone.
---
Perhaps the acid sprayer could still not do too much damage but it could be used to damage armor quickly.
---
Food and water will be provided! Spectators are free bring a friend! Last week there was roughly 10K between side bets and overall prizes!
---
that spot can have many events on it at once I saw horde events for the mire/forest there at the same time earleir
---
I think there are likely to be decent tanks like you're suggesting because of PVP and melee builds but my main concern is a lack of healers.
---
lol
---
That’s cold
---
&gt;And if you want to fight people, come dance with us on survival.
---
 I'll come to survival once they make a real survival mode. This arcade style death match crap is for the birds.
---
 No leader boards, no map markers and locked to your server.  Therefore you can't level up on easy mode and go over to survival.  It's laughable to even think that could be considered survival.
---
A scorched creature is turned scorched once a scorch beast "crop dusts " them
---
Also a weird off note lol I think its pretty damn cool that the dead bodies are actually showing rot. I know its kinda morbid but its kinda like finding a fresh apple deep in a thousand year old crypt in Skyrim when in fo4 youd be strolling by and they been dead for a while.
---
I started a new character for survival to take advantage of the +100% xp bonus last weekend. He's level 18 now, has never played adventure mode, and has never been killed by another player. Lots of sneaking around, stealing what he can, ambushing the occasional other player, scrounging for ammo. It's been an absolute blast.
---
get a life grindlord
---
I'm suuuper skeptical that Skype waiting to update is the actual cause
---
This does happen. When you're digging up a few of them the messages will stop appearing but you will get loot . Server hop fixes it.
---
I server hopped a bit until it was a 3 star super mutant overlord, legendary qualified, so I kited him to the north fissure as suggested, worked for the challenge. Thank you for that. Upon killing this legendary, all I got was a Nocturnal Rolling Pin.
---
I agree, diseases should have more impact, but less often. I seriously cant count the amount of times ive caught a disease from one touch, in fact I think im turning into a rad worm.
---
Me too I enjoy my plastic farming routes.
---
That would allow gold farmers to horde a bunch more legendary weapons to sell if they  can just repair them immediately prior to sale. That would be a great buff to the degenerates who look at grinding in a video game as a way to make money!
---
And it's not like it damages that much of your PA.
---
I noticed little damage to my x01 after dying at least 7 times
---
Errrr. Probably not that uncommon?
---
Did PS just start allowing you to change your account name or are you referring to something else?
---
I wipe out the scorched, more just spawn in without it landing! The only way to stop them respawning is to kill the Scorch beast!
---
Just look at Counter-Strike and/or Team Fortress 2 and the sprays you used to be able to put up...
---
Nice! Guess I'm gonna hit that school over and over again til I get my plastic. It a luxury problem actually, I got too much steel and I need to make those bulks!
---
I've just started learning stuff the game doesn't tell you, like unlocking weapon mods. Etc. 
---
There comes a point where the game starts scaling content but you're so under geared (mostly from lack of exploring and just trying to do quests only)
---
I find the more you explore the better off you are and the more you're going to learn and unlock.
---
My first kill was a bullet sponge too. I actually use a decent recon silenced 10mm pistol to kill it. Took me probably 10-20 mins.
---
Well "that will put you down in two shots" does not definitely apply for every weapon and against every build. Yesterday I met a strange PA guy that was surprisingly effective in PvP, and I had serious troubles with diagnosing how come guy can stand so much, but it doesn't mean I haven't been able to kill him. Myself I regurarly hear that I am a cheater because my health just keeps rebouncing and it makes me proud on how well I organised my build :)
---
I’ve just accepted my fate that I will continue to get that “wooden leg” and the only way to get that awesome gear I’ve got to trade of it....  
---
I prefer to find the stuff myself, but found that I don’t have much choice. If I really want it I have to, I have to buy it
---
Exactly! There’s no downside to just doing the event like you’re supposed to. And every downside to just beating on an invincible and sometimes invisible enemy. You’re gonna get wiped out either way, whether it’s from the aforementioned invincible enemy or the pylon’s continuous HP drain. The only difference is that in the first example you also fail the event!
---
Thank you, I forget the horde events are a thing, I used to avoid em b inevitably when I fast traveled the event ended upon arrival
---
I find power armor is good at resisting that scorch acid attack. If you're not in it, take two stims and RUN to the edge of its area of effect!
---
Oh HELL yes that’s the size I wanted when I bought the tiny one.
---
People have such an emotional stake in convincing others to not enjoy things, it's unreal.
---
dates? times? how to join / who to join / where to join?....
---
Do you have the grounded or adrenal reaction mutations?
---
Im lvl60 and still didn't complete it because I was more interested in getting Bos and Enclave faction so I can lunch nukes
---
If the manager knew an employee was trying to get out to not buy a game......
---
I could get behind something like that idea!  Especially if they guarantee 3* loot
---
Some are still selling for 100caps I seen last night. I bought several dozen even though I can make them.
---
Yeah in my mind I was thinking he was an idiot bc his job is to sell games lol. He probably didnt even play the game lol
---
Please add the junker too...
---
People who are wanted should not receive caps for kills in adventure its that easy. I have seen to many people baiting with big cap bounties and they make more money off killing people with their bloodied one shot melee builds. Why should some guy with a 30 cap bounty get over a hundred caps when he kills me whats the point of being wanted.
---
I know but I’m saying they should add more again like a Brahmin outfit or scorchbeast outfit
---
Theres a lot of us having that issue. I had to put away game for now. Its fucking unplayable
---
I think it was server side maintenance, not a patch? Not really sure though
---
I'm experiencing the same thing.  My game will just randomly freeze with no warning message and I have to shut my PS4 off completely.
---
Quite possibly. Man, if only I could pay my real earned money to fix them...
---
Information for this week's fight!

https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bcbzyj/ps4_fist_fight_tomorrow_night_need_more_people/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
I’m actually not that type of player.
---
I have really only 1 character that’s worth anything, been playing since the beta, and I am only a level 112.
---
Seeing all the cool loot that is out there and believing that I may never acquire it through chance is rather frustrating.
---
There’s very much a benefit. A good chunk of my money comes from the excess chems I hoard from this perk. It’s also the reason I have over 200 Stimpaks in my inventory.
---
You gotta build a client base.  I to run a bar. And then I get little to no success with just randoms walking by. So I started posting all over Reddit. And I made decent money doing it. I even have repeat customers who message me on PSN asking if I'm open to buy some more stuff
---
The are lots of reports of this, and I'm experience the same bug.  We need to get more visibility to maximize chances of getting a fix soon, so I'm upvoting every thread I see.
---
Also, everyone make an official bug report of you haven't already
---
Tl;dw: nothing
---
Information for this week's fight
---
I'd prefer if they used carrot instead of stick. Make me want to stay in a server. Dont force me to. 
---
During double xp, i server hopped west tek. Usually, i server hop for good (okay decent) events. Once youve explored the map and done the quests, the gameplay loop is getting better stuff. That takes 3* enemies. And they're extremely rare. So we server hop to try and find them. Add more 3* enemies, let me trigger the events i want to play, and i won't need do hop all the time.
---
Hopefully.  I’m curious how he will operate.
---
Brotherhood flags would be sweet
---
Plot twist: the mod for it is extremely rare
---
Can you comment why it wasn't found pre-release?
---
I have never(well almost never) found that diseases make any real diffence to my game play, at all.
---
Not a single enemy in the game guarantees a 3 star drop! My last Queen fight dropped a 1* junkies pool cue!
---
This is something they should be fixing for all legendary enemies not just this one, I've been playing since the beta and have only gotten 3 3*legendary drops total, the rest I bought with caps!
---
Use enforcer perk, couple of pot shots into a SB's wings makes them land. I almost never worry bout the adds until the beast is dead, unless you're unlucky like me an a SB scorches something big, like the behemoth you're fighting...
---
It also explodes in a nuclear blast when you use it. Can only place 1.
---
Where you place it initially (aka the center of the circle) affects where *others* spawn. But, for some reason not the camp owner.
---
It happens dude, all the time
---
Also. I wonder what biv has ever said. He takes a while to say it.
---
Legit play this game pretty casually as I have work and school. Maybe an hour or less a day, try again, "grindlord." 😘
---
It wasn’t to you, it was to a response and honestly I took a lot of baggage into that response, lol. It was probably a bit over the top. 
---
If you play 1,2 and tactics, you can feel a lot of the same qualities. Some of the story of tactics is ruled out as it creates some really odd contradictions. At the risk of spoiling you, The brightest minds were gathered in cryo in vault zero to control the vault experiments and help the surface with robots, however, government cut backs meant they were missing certain protective protocols, so they all went mad and that’s why all the robots on the surface are hostile. Lots of continuity problems there so I can understand overwriting that, although I did really like it at the time. 
---
Brotherhood of steel is an entirely different beast. As soon as you play you get an immediate sense of it being distant from it’s predecessors. You can play as a ghoul, which is cool, but that’s about it. No nuka cola, which isn’t a deal breaker but it does feel odd. Also, gone are the vintage soundtrack choices, you have a nu metal angsty 2000’s soundtrack, which is... jarring.
---
I suspect this is a bug and reported it to Beth yesterday. Hopefully it is actually a bug.
---
I would rather see fewer(or is it lesser) 3 star legendary enemies if it guarenteed a 3 star drop.
---
The vendors reset after 20 hours. So conceivably you could make 2800 in just over 20 hours.
---
Just wanna say, I emptied 1000 50 caliber rounds into it but I only got a flamer
---
The game is in a much better place than when it first came out. That being said I always thought it was great and will continue to play well into the future. Enjoy. 
---
P.S. As with all these online games it’s better with friends!
---
I'm saying it's not that easy as you think
---
I would participate. I played tuesday with garb of mistery and fasnatch mask. I let myself be killed fast but the challenge didn't update. 
---
Do you have to win it? Because if yes,even if farmed with people,it would take forever to get it for everyone.
---
Thank you. All of my friends are on that bandwagon unfortunately lol
---
I just realized that that point looks like it might be the centerpoint of the map... That might explain why events show up there, if it's the default placement of icons or something.
---
I'm lvl 33 or so and I 3-4 melee hits and a lvl 68 ghoul are dead wow y u have bad weapons XD I use just the standard lvl 30 superhammer awesome weapon.
---
Nuka Cherry. Blocker perk. Sentinel Armor.
---
I was totally solo.
---
Well my excitement for this game was to be able to compete against rival gangs within the Fallout universe. Frankly, what I've been given so far nicely allows me to get the thrill I seek. While I don't try to belittle titles where things such as scavenging for food and water are deadly challenges that might not end up well, I don't think its what'd provide me the best experience. The food and water are not a part of the equation in F1 or F2. I played hundreds of hours of FOnline thats an online mashup of F1 and F2 that was an extreme Fallout game with strong thrill from surviving, and the food/water mechanic was completely neglected there. 
---
My thrill comes from engaging in interactions with clever bastards. Not looking for food. I'm not saying "no, please dont give this man an actual survival oriented survival", I'd be happy if they implemented what you described as a separate game mode. I'd even propose to harshify it and remove legendary items from that mode and add full loot drop. I'd play that for sure.
---
But if they implemented that, I'd still be wanting to play what is now called survival, even if 'manhunt' would fit it better. And the markers - you can hide yours, and you can use it for your advantage. The way I interpret survival, adapt or die. I adapted to benefit from map markers.
---
HEAVY WEAPONS BUILDS ARE FINALLY REPRESENTED
---
How would the betting work bro?
---
Not everyone wants to play melee
---
1300 for my character!
---
The first one I killed was duking it out with a Mirelurk Queen.
---
Ok, ok, the first one I got credit for, was killed by a Mirelurk Queen.
---
I agree, shutting down a server unscheduled with just 20 mins warning isn't very nice from Bethesda. I noticed it happens often when most players logged out and I was the last player in the server.
---
i think he is talking about the mist attack they do when they fly over you
---
Best legendary 3\* Tesla IMO is either Bloodied/+10% damage aiming/reload speed or Quad/+25% fire rate/reload speed, both fully automatic, and Commando/Tank Killer for perks.  On the Bloodied you probably don't need Tank Killer.
---
The VATS legendary modifiers might be better for those into VATS and PvP though.
---
A guy was wrecking another players house, so i killed him. Got 5 caps from his bounty. Did this 5-10 more times, then he finally got me once and collected 170 caps off me. Uhh... What?
---
I just want the garden plots from fallout 4...
---
Last week before matches people were simply placing bets asda fights we're about to start another words for example 500 caps on skybuster and someone will take you up on it. I was also throwing out random "house bets" like saying 5 to 1 on so and so! Added some excitement!
---
From what I have been reading from others’ responses to this thread is that they also agree with you!
---
Not guaranteed, I've never gotten a 3* drop from her!
---
Anything scorched should attack anything that's "not...us...".
---
I think being wanted often is more profitable than not, and that should be reworked. Your idea is actually pretty nice - now if you want PvP it might be cheaper to be wanted as you loose less caps per death.
---
It was popular to hate FO76. So youtubers hated on it and got hits. 
---
It wasn't about the game it was about clicks. Enjoy!
---
Ok, because I've played with random lvl 90 people and they were still doing it.
---
you can check out my guide for farming them [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8tOvTXCBQs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8tOvTXCBQs)  they should be there  if not just server hop
---
I’ve seen the response of let’s also make them harder with a guarantee 3* drop.
---
Personally, I think it would be awesome to battle to the near death to fight for a 3* guarantee loot drop!
---
It is the center actually.
---
That's why sometimes you see random player icons there while people are connecting. If you happen to open the map when they connect but before their location data has loaded, they show up on the map as in that location.
---
All the bugs, massive patch sizes and the behaviour of Bethesda all other little skandals brought it to this point. Right now the game is pretty enjoyable. I play it alone btw
---
Nope, as soon as 3 pylons are activates his invis goes away and can be dmged. When he’s invis he can’t take dmg so it’s worthless to even try
---
Simply dreadful darling. Abhorrent. Absurd.
---
You're a unicorn, if it's passed my old man bedtime mistakes are made.
---
All the vendor bots are now (also) in WS resort. 
---
One last night had all sorts of PA mods, 480 caps and up.
---
Yes, many people have encountered it.  I haven't seen evidence that Bethesda has acknowledged it yet, so I'm upvoting all threads I see about it and encouraging everyone to put in a support ticket.
---
sometimes at workshops you have to defend against 3 schorchbeasts and they also sometimes just leave. I know because I was hiding inside the munitions factory mooching off the ammo machine and they attacked they broke the generators so I skittered away and right as I got to the road they found me, I ran south for a while and into some random persons camp he came outside and  waved at me I kept running as the beasts ripped his camp apart as I looked back all I saw was an angry icon.
---
If you aim for the wings they'll drop in no time. But sometimes it'd hard. - Shotgun user
---
I speent 😂😂
---
Oh God I never considered that
---
Costing me 1300 with unyielding armor boosting my charisma, no grape Mentats at all!
---
It might be something to do with bethesda splitting into 4 divisions that look at things very differently.
---
Same, tried to attach a mod to some power armour, makes the noise but doesn't attach and doesn't consume the mod
---
A problem for my unarmed character, my main drops them in 6 bullets even while flying!
---
When I'm on my alt and see high level around I will often server hop, cause they (re)spawn high level mobs. It is not nice to clear area or event just to find yourself surrounded by 60+ ghouls/super mutants up your ass.
---
I find it's fun to play with others but it's good to go off like its a classic fallout and just explore. My main thing with playing around others is trolls. Bc I know if you have an open world multiplayer game where you can kill each other, I thought it would be a clusterfuck.
---
How are you paying 200 caps and and flux? Also, just die... don't use stimpacks... much easier to just respawn. If you and a few people hit it when its vunerable, you should be using less than 100 shells too. It's really not that much of a sponge. It just hits really hard.
---
Once you're in X-01 it does no dmg whatsoever.
---
I'm level 88 and I still feel like this.
---
Well done! Though, im confident 98% of the player base wont be running a build like that. XD
---
Great, is your name the same as here? If not please inbox me, thanks!
---
I hope you continue to enjoy it! Aside from all the negativity it gets it's a decent game with it's fair share of problems.
---
Do you need the lower level one to make the higher level one?
---
I play alone because non of my friends have the game. They were all caught by the crapfleet about the game. And I don't want to team up with someone I don't know. 
---
The survival mode is the mod were you can kill each other isn't it?
---
Also, absolutely use the trading community.  I have no need for melee weapons as a sniper, but I traded this monster (https://imgur.com/GXcKxJ1 ) for a GREAT rifle (https://imgur.com/4iTeMDI) that I absolutely adore.
---
kill a wendigo with a clown costume will reappear after you do it ive done it twice and its still there
---
Good point. That’s quite a lame experience especially after you were so key to their success. Douchebags.
---
did you enable swap file for any harddrive?
---
Gimme a second to check. I just got the event right away after server hopping
---
Let the semi finals be boxing gloves only, would be a fun to watch 👍
---
I'm not sure but I'm in the same situation lol
---
&gt; If Scorchbeast acid attacks could not go through solid walls and ceilings, that'd be great.
---
But then again, it's how WV got scorched and why you [End up having to nuke it](/spoiler). If getting into a building was sufficient, then the population wouldn't have been wiped. Methinks
---
Never ceases to amaze me the number of people who come on here to trash the game. Some don't even own it. If they don't like it jog off.  Glad you're enjoying it.
---
No rush haha. I'm just trying to see if I need to keep doing the event on my main (for whom I already sold the low-level Fixer) or if I should use another character to go through the questline to get the level 30 version again, THEN find the plans so I can get the high level one.
---
seen him several times in the Forest.  Red eyes,  just stared at me for a few moments, and poof.
---
  Couple nights ago, in the WS nuke zone.  yellow eyed, L50.  Potshotted this one with a gause rifle.  Minimal damage.  He returned fire, but missed.  Traded a couple more shots with pretty much the same result.  I moved on -   he did not follow.

I hadn't seen that Bethesda had actually noticed yet.  I'm still upvoting all threads about this and encouraging everyone to submit a bug report.
---
I'm super salty, I discovered this when I went to add a jetpack to a new PA setup I was working on.
---
It is. On PC at least it stopped occurring after the thursday maintenance
---
cool
---
story
---
bro
---
Ahhh right I get ya it’s like an illegal fight club in West Virginia haha I would like to come and spectate a. Fight eventually, so do I gotta add you to come to one, cause I’m always online, and maybe one day I’d actually fight haha fallout 76 got boring for me
---
Any news for those suspended that haven't just bought a new account?
---
Yeah to me I see the effort put into the game. Some People say its just a copy of fo4 but I see the improvement and it really does look alot better. Sure there ismt npcs but I think they r making up for it
---
sometimes in Harper's ferry the mutant hounds spawn schorched and their owners have to put them down 😥
---
Thank you for the suggestion each week we are going to do slightly different rules to keep a different and exciting. That will probably be a rule at some point. 
---
** (Spoiler) I was also thinking about doing tag team at some point!
---
Level 50 mats are
---
9 Adhesive
---
10 Gear
---
8 Oil
---
15 Screw
---
15 Spring
---
18 Steel
---
14 Wood
---
 
---
Thats it!
---
If you like you can go near the pylon and move around it to basically avoid Sheepsquatch. His laser attack will even hit the pylon
---
The lack of npcs, while unusual, kind of is the story. You're trying to find out why everything went to shit before the vault opened.  There's a lot of good voice overs on the holotapes if you get into them, as well as plenty of terminals to read. I get why some people don't like it, but it's never really bothered me as part of a multiplayer game.
---
What if the "signal" is the sheepsquatch's tracking tag going off
---
you can check out my guide they ar plenty out there  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8tOvTXCBQs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8tOvTXCBQs)
---
Yes. And spectators can bet, but it'll be a lot more fun if you join! My character is terrible at fighting it's just a ton of fun!
---
Only gotten 3 3* drops total, since the beta, all my other 3 stars were bought from players!
---
Standing on a pile of dead ghouls....priceless!
---
 That's fair. I just don't like you suggesting the majority of people with tons of caps did to illegitimately, because while some have, most save up caps and make good trades. The trading community hated dupers and exploiters. I play on pc and the majority of items are fairly priced (again a lot of stuff has become more affordable actually), but the high-priced items tend to be high end items for endgame players who are still accumulating caps but don't need them, so they can afford to spend more. Personally I still keep bidding on the lower end and work up, but my opinion of low on a TSE or AAE hunting rifle for example is 4-6k and depending on a third effect I'd be willing to bid up to 15-16k. I probably wouldn't spend 25k on a single item, especially an armor piece, but if someone has the caps and wants to offer that high that's up to them.
---
I was going to make a post like this because I would love it if they made one! I wanna see my moth boy sitting on my shelf in my room.
---
had one drop on top of the top of the world could not get that one
---
This all actually sounds super fun, I may join in and punch people around. Also you should probably make people unequip their melee focused perk cards? But I don't think it can make that much of a difference but I could be wrong. (Im a melee build, wouldn't want to have a huge advantage over anyone.) ♥️
---
I killed my first 50 scorch beast at 20... Not saying it was easy or reasonable but you can do something at 37 unless you made a tremendously awful build.
---
It is good general-purpose rifle if you can kill your target with 5 bullets or less from stealth. However, the Anti-armor effect is inferior compared to a full versus effect. For example, a Troubleshooter's LA deals 43% more effective damage to a 120 DR protectron than a regular LA whereas an Anti-armor LA deals only 28% more effective damage. 
---
I now completely switched to versus Handmades because of the fire rate and drum magazine is far better than the slow and limited LA.
---
The masks were mentions in a documentary by noclip before the game came
---
Oh nice, I was worried it was going to be another mistress of mystery situation where I sold the low-level items and didn't realize I could level them up haha. Not bad at all.
---
Yeah it was just server side maintenance but my thinking was you may not need a client update to alter some of this stuff.
---
No you not need the lower level one. The one you craft can also be modded.
---
We're could we find more parts I have a PA but no right arm and left leg part.
---
It's been this way for my for months.
---
&gt;which is highly abusive in the world of slap damage; 
---
There is no slap damage anymore.
---
Level 245 here. Almost always the highest level on the map and the highest level at queen fights. 
---
Do people you trade with automatically assume every gun you have is explosive? Sold a guy my 2 star bloody shotgun and he was like... "oh, this isn't explosive, I thought 2000 caps was pretty cheap."
---
Yeh I hear ya. I've done it with one item myself haha
---
Do this fusion core run, server hop a few times and you will have plenty. Also equip the perks that slow power fusion core usage (forget the name), once upgraded it gets to like 200% life. I've got so many fusion cores I don't have to pick any up for a few weeks.
---

---
For stims, farm technical data at the whitesprings bunker and sugar grove. When you turn them in at Camp Venture (only grab 2 at a time, they stack), you'll almost always get stims as a reward. And it helps you move forward and try to get some of the rare PA BoS paint jobs. Those stims will get back up pretty quick.
---
If you've got enough caps, I think you can purchase the stimpack recipe in the enclave bunker. Worth it for when you get blood packs as drops.
---
In the silo, make sure you use the terminals to disable the turrets, it def helps save on ammo. Also pick up a melee weapon, it'll help you save your ammo for the nuke fight (especially if you are dropping at fissure prime).
---
Good luck, you'll make it though this part... then you'll have more stims and fusion cores than you know what to do with.
---
It's good to make it's own opinion. However it's not because you don't like the game that you are in a hater bandwagon. 
---
People who don't like it also have their reasons, doesn't  mean you can't like it.
---
I haven't played the game since February, did they make scorch beasts less of a bullet sponge? Cause one of the things I found annoying was dumping unreal amount of bullets to kill them
---
It is slightly retextured but it is the rescue diver suit https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Rescue_diver_suit
---
This is a good opportunity to use those cards! Join the fight! We'd love to have you! IM me your PSN level and strength!
---
Just hit 165 and I have over a dozen perk points to use/swap. Don't know what to do with them.
---
I think all of that needs an actual patch.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Rescue_diver_suit
---
It may well do
---
The mothman museum IRL has an awesome mothman plush.
---
Side note, this is also how I end up in the closed bunkers on occasion as well. Usually hunt for the x horde leader, rats most often, but I find myself in a vault or the location where the legendary vendor is going to be.
---
Me and all my friends recently got the game and we are loving it! I'm currently level 43 and going up fast. I just never understood why it got so much hate.
---
Sure thing!
---
Survival mode is in the game
---
This could of been my man and he said ya welcome he is level 248  company s he dropped a load of plans ran off lol
---
Reddit tip, unless there is an asterisk beside the timestamp, the post wasn't edited :)
---
What’s your PSN? If you like you can add me My PSN is iRaid_3 if you want to add me, I’ll get my game updated and when I’m free and there’s a fight me and my friend come and watch 🙌
---
still happened to me yesterday evening, after maintenance
---
You can get the real thing in the bunker under Mam Dolce's.
---
After seeing a youtube video yesterday about the new mod coming out for Fallout 4 called F.L.O.R.A and some of the other settlement mods, I had to go back. I don't have too many complaints about Fallout 76, my main one is the story, Bethesda treated it like a side quest and that was unfortunate, my one other main complaint is forcing everyone to essentially play in survival mode by having everything have weight and expire. They really need to upgrade their servers, using that as a way to limit items in the world is a cheap performance boost. I enjoy hoarding my Stimpacks and my unique legendary weapons. Hopefully the update in the winter adds some considerable Quest and/or story content.
---
Suckage. Probably a hit or miss fix that requires a client side update.
---
Same as my name on here
---
Uhh, there were [pictures of it](https://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/2ykcBYg6WSKcOMCwSsjC6H/19f440c3fb5fa2eb3f110a021fd64e18/Fallout76_ATX_HeroStatue_ESRB_711x400.gif) next to a player character in the release notes about this statue...
---
New Vegas is definitely canon.
---
There is no definite storyline to the series. But the world is sort of persistent between the games. Note that the Fallout games typically have multiple endings. Each game after Fallout 1 considers some ending to be canon and goes on with the story. Fallout 1 and 2 vaguely share a storyline, but after that the games are more or less isolated, mostly just referencing stories from the previous games. The events of Fallout 2 are a direct consequence of those of 1. Even your character in 2 is the grandchild of the main character from 1. Similarly, in 2, we see several political struggles starting in the West Coast that heavily feature in New Vegas. In the same way, Fallout 3 is almost independent of Fallout 1 and 2 (although it completely acknowledges that the events of those games did happen on the other side of the country) and as far as I know, anything established by Fallout 1 and 2 has not been contradicted by Fallout 3. Fallout 4 has events that are a direct consequence of Fallout 3, eg the Elder of the BoS in Fallout 4 is Arthur Maxson, who is a decendant of Roger Maxson and was a child in Fallout 3. Many things about the Appalachia and Vault 76 had been mentioned olim Fallout 3 and 4, and we have seen many of them confirmed in Fallout 76. Also, there are plenty of references, such as Roger Maxson being in contact with Elizabeth Taggerdy, and the little reference to the Mistress of Mystery fan Kent Connelly, who we see as a comics loving ghoul in Fallout 4. We don't yet know the canon endings to Fallout 4 and 76. 76's canon ending will likely be known as time progresses, as 7t does not seen to have a branching storyline, while Fallout 4 's ending will be known in Fallout 5.
---
Not necessarily, as the UI is correct and it even makes the sound when you try to attach them it may be a behind the scenes issue with getting a server response back to the client. As such if it's a one way issue then only need to technically patch one side, which side is causing the issue is yet to be seen...
---
I legit just noticed there will be an award, if I win can I choose to not take it and it be given to someone else?
---
Agree thats why I won’t bother to complete them or buy atoms. There are always other ways to enjoy the game. Shame though its gone this way.
---
High desease rates give the perks cards value. Otherwise if the desease rate was lower why would anyone use the perks cards that lower desease rates.
---
Friend of mine keeps calling the buttressed armor mod butt-stressed. To each their own. ;-)
---
Happened before as well. Server hopping usually fixes it.
---
They nerfed brahmin milk it works as intended now you will succeed like once per ten tries.
---
**[ DANGER ]**
---
Good point!! Spot on needs a patch asap
---
Not in the store, didn’t see those at the time
---
What u selling your deathclaw gaunntlets for my psn is c614thechad mesaage me there
---
Honestly, I played since the Beta test and stopped a week after launch. It did get boring and repetitive. However I started up again a bit before the Fasnacht event and it has gotten better since launch. It was a bit boring (for me) at launch but we can all agree, its gotten better and it will be better moving forward.
---
There's a fix for this that also happens to resolve an issue people have been having with workshops since the launch of the game - make workshop PvP active only when you're within the workshop area.
---
I makes no sense to me that if you're on the other side of the map no where near your workshop that the PvP safeties are turned off. If you're not within the workshop area, safe to say that you're not going to contest the takeover from someone else, so PvP doesn't need to be initiated.
---
Having said that though, you make the workshop "exploit" thing by griefers sound like it's going to be a cash cow. I don't think it's going to be that frequent. Not without a bunch of server hopping at any rate.
---
Reason why the junk jet probably won’t come into the game is because of duplicate glitches
---
I dont think the jet would work in 76. Loot all drops in bags, where the jet literally shot junk at you and then you could pick it up again
---
I read that last part in MODUS's voice.
---
They were released at least a week in advance of the statues and it's been on the front page of the client for that long... Its your fault for not having looked lol.
---
well that escalated quickly
---
I didn’t kill the queen, I solo killed a SB at Prime and leveled up, didn’t get that credit. I also killed a leg. Gulper at Prime; also didn’t get credit.
---
Well, cc info are stored by sony, so you basicly just buy to sony that buys you the atoms to bethesda.
---
This is because of tax fraud reasons, but you buy to sony that then buys the atoms for you.
---
Not affected by latency
---
Big oof nvm then
---
That's dope! I'll have to look for that when it releases.
---
Yeesssss I now want to roll as a shaman with a brahmin head and ragstag robe selling chems to the wastland. 
---
I'd also like a phamicist outfit for the same reason except I'd sell chems from my camp with a big neon "Drugs" sign
---
Yep, I've stopped taking part in this event due to this very reason
---
First thing I thought of when listening to that audio
---
I have a Bloodied 25% FR for sale :)
---
Finally a big statue!
---
What are you looking for?
---
I've personally fallen through the world in all of them at least once. Mileage varies from player to player.
---
You can give it away if you'd like.
---
What?
---
On xbox :(
---
Hmmm?
---
They do allow it
---
It's the game people love to hate. FYI said people have either never played it or have been banned
---
I did not. I also don’t believe that improves damage on guns, on melee weapons.
---
Add me you marvelous bastard
---
A Dumb Heavy
---
You came in at a good time new quest just got released and the first dungeon is opening up later this month. 
---
What system are you on I'd be down to group up sometime it you'd like.
---
Here later today I can help you grind white springs
---
The event isn't worth it anyway unless you want to look like a sheep xD
---
Says the toxic guy who comments douch nozzle on every post acting like that’s gonna hurt someone feelings. Plus it’s not bitching when he tells the truth
---
ah man I had a mod that gave you tracking mirv fatman shots 
---
and with the right commands any gun with a barrel mod could receive the signal repeater barrel meant for the gamma gun. doing this would make the gun fire extremely fast if you did it to a missile launcher and gave it a never ending mod and a 4 round clip the clip would spin insanely fast and it would spew out rockets
---
The last patch notes did say something about "certain groups will now fight each other as intended" or something like that.
---
Nope, only marsupial so these stats are baseline.
---
I’ve seen pictures SAH’s that people were selling pre patch with base damage of 80, which matches my memory. The wikis (albeit not the most accurate) also list base damage as 80 so I’m confident that it’s changed
---
I almost posted something like this. Glad to see I'm not the only one slightly annoyed with the haters and negative hype.
---
Oh boy, another post saying they bought the game despite criticism! 
---
Can I post it tomorrow for karma?
---
I hope when player vending comes up we'll be able to choose different icons to showcase what we'll be selling.  That'd be the easiest way to get folks into a bar.
---
Tbh it was pretty forgettable and outclassed by the much awesomer Thirst Zapper (Beth please bring this back like seriously)
---
What they should do is bring the Soaker back with the same minimal damage, but also reduce the target's armor by 30%/50% to all damage sources for a few seconds
---
Fallout New Vegas. 
---
The owner of the Atomic Wrangler asks you to find him three very specific people to "service" his customers. He wanted a cowboy ghoul, a sauve man for the "boyfriend experience" and a sex robot.
---
It becomes clear he wants the robot for himself.
---
Maybe your hands are cold.  ;)
---
They mentioned something in the patch notes about milking Brahmin.  I think you can't milk your own.
---
Happy Cake Day, my friend.
---
That's pretty normal. Which is why I never turn off pacifist mode. 
---
Any level can be wearing the godliest armor and wielding the godliest guns.
---
Plus power armor is pretty useless in PVP. Great for PVE, but vs. Players you are just big and slow and loud as fuck.
---
Agreed, it's total shit. I hide during it, in the sense that I'm chameleoned on the roof of the little house so I can take sneaky potshots at all the robots. I'm a sniper, it's what we do. My kill count is higher than anyone else on the battlefield.
---
Why would a high level player be sitting in the Forrest?
---
And that way maintinence is always done when cali ppl get home, it was a joke by the way. But time is wierd evry other mmo i ever played had maintinence way later.
---
I'm on xbox one and sure I'm down.
---
Oh really? I wonder if perhaps I was actually at the other fissure site nearby then?
---
I need to buy loads of Sentinel pieces so I can tank these Pylons efficiently
---
I make sure i have no junk before i go over and loot only after the fight is over.
---
Yes, those would be pretty powerful at max charge. I **think** each change multiplies the damage so 10 charges would be 10x what the stat screen shows. 20x for a quad. So yes in theory they’re very strong but it takes a lot of time to charge up and you better not miss
---
I still get the error even when I do it this way. It just sounds like alot of work every time you set up camp. I guess you have to place each and every foundation before the blueprint every single time. Easier to just have the foundations as part of the blueprint, especially since this bug occurs either way
---
I know, its a figure of speech :p
---
.
---
THERE ARE SUPER MUTANT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MAP THAT ARE RUINING MY CROPS. SOMEBODY PLZ HALP
---
So sorry I didn’t see your message! My IGN is Molybzen, you can add me if you want still!
---
Ah, gotcha complete r/woooosh for me.
---
But I assume that they are just doing it when is most convenient for their workers. I.e. 10am eastern time is easier on their people then 2am eastern time.
---
Fair enough, just checking for error
---
Nope, it’s the rise of the wombles!
---
I have no problem with pvp. But I was in team with them and they are completely mean spirited. I take workshops all the time, gets good xp.  But they would take advantage like go on hemp with the defense of a workshop, friend the guy, then destroy his base later just out of spite in another server.  This was malicious and should have been in survival, but they like that they could see their marks on the map, so they play adventure.  
---
This is not just pvp, this is survival with map locations.  Taking advantage of lower level players who are grateful for a higher level rolling in to rescue them.
---
I’ll add you bro 👍
---
You can’t farm it over and over. If you farmed it recently and you’re the one to load the area it will be empty. Give it a few days.
---
**Ballistic attacks by any enemies also go through walls.**
---
I often have died by camping inside a room, trailer or small building by getting shot though walls. And meanwhile I can't shoot enemies though any obstacles.
---
I hope Bethesda will make roofs that can hold rain and walls that won't magically be non-existent to enemies.
---
They must have broken the camp system even more, nothing hanging out or over anything, small foundation with just a few things on it. Can't place because of item support error. Guess we won't be making anything intricate anymore then
---
Put calibrated shocks on excavator and you get +200 carry weight plus decent armor. DR makes so very little difference. Perks and just having any PA on are where the real damage reduction comes in. The hidden damage reduction for equipping a PA is substantial.
---
Not a problem. It’s important to cover all bases so nothing wrong with the question
---
This is how big i had hoped the first PA statue would be, so i bought it. Now I don't have enough atom for the thing I wanted in the first place.
---
Oh snap! That’s a super recent change and I love it. Thanks for inadvertently bringing that to my attention lol
---
Your power armor is a good one! ( Kralnor op. cit.)
---
Have fun, you will find more and more as game go on :)
---
Also what console
---
I just found out yesterday in the same way. It was through some meme.
---
Extra wet BO.
---
This is where Is put my ultra cute power armor... IF I HAD ONE.
---
I have a feeling they will be in the new quest, found the doc at Harper's ferry, that had one.
---
I know someone who has never played the game and constantly trashes the game and me for playing it. It's ironic because he considers himself a "free thinker" but has never touched the game to make his own opinion. You will find there are some who played and didn't like it and that's ok. It's the people who have never played it and trash it that really get me going.
---
I once fell only waste deep into the ground and couldn't jump out or move, all while fighting a lvl 80 SB and its minions in a nuke zone around White Springs. 
---
I had to kill everything while standing still, oh and I could only hipfire or I would just shoot the rocks. Then I fast traveled out once everything was dead.
---
Memes make the world go ‘round
---
Would love some Scotland flags on my build.
---
There is a Mothman pop cap vinyl figure I believe.
---
New event is Waaaaaaay easier than SBQ...
---
I took your post in a fun way and was only picking at you a bit, I hope you realize that.
---
Just got mine yesterday!
---
This is what I hate about the game, really high level players thinking they deserve to be there more than low level players. Not everyone has time to rack up hundreds of hours. To say level 30 and 40s don’t deserve to be there is pretty arrogant. We’ve all paid for the game so why should t they go and have a go. So at what level do you think it’s ok then? Let me guess you’re level 20345.
---
I feel like more people should realize that the game is good and also has an amazing community that likes to help the new players
---
I only started playing again recently and tried doing the Whitespring loop to get some legendaries. I don't really want to farm for profit, I just wanted one or two things relevant to me; a combat shotgun and rifle of some description. Its so boring but ultimately I had to anyway for the Officer on Deck quest. You see these level 200-300 guys crashing about there in their power armour obliterating everything with their two shot explosive guns and I think, why are they doing it, seems like they really don't need any more legendaries at that point.
---
With the new update they added mounted creatures in the wall decoration section of the camp you can only get the plans for a couple right now from the lying lowe quest and the side missions (4 of them on the board in the top floor of the taxidermy shop) but they have mounts for everything exept grafton monster,flatwoods monster, and all robots
---
I'm on xbox to
---
Lucky bastard! I hope you enjoy his presence.
---
If the building is stored, yes. Not a pure blueprint. There is a difference. I can't place my blueprint, and it's not a stored building. So the only thing I can do is delete the blueprint. I can't place it to fix what is wrong, so the placement-error is fixed, literally only choice is deletion.
---
This is where I'd put my ultra cute power armor... IF I HAD ONE.
---
Same unfortunately, I had one buddy that played and didn't like it. Everyone else bought the hype. My friend who bought it and didn't like it tried it again in Feb and decided he still didn't like it, and that's ok by me.
---
Yeah I mean so far I havent really seen any trolling. Which if you have big boy pants isnt a big deal but it is annoying
---
A hunting rifle or lever action rifle with the Concentrated Aim and Tormentor perks will help you take out the rotors. Each rotor you cripple reduces its speed, and with all 4 crippled it pretty much just hovers in place.
---
I enjoyed the game for a week then some guy followed a friend and I around and just kept killing us. He was level 100+ but the game literally just came out. I hadn’t played it since haha
---
I'm wondering if, when prestiging comes out we'll be able to cash in every 50 levels we already have for a higher level of prestige?
---
How do you get them to follow you to the fissure, my enemies just keep staying in the ditch?
---
I would but only if they break the lore and add Institute flags. I mean they've already screwed with the lore so why not do so here and get a flag for the best faction in Fallout?
---
I think the burrows is gonna be instanced meaning you can only go in as a group of 1-4
---
There are angled lights that do a better job for this sort of thing than street lamps... I say go for it. If you pay attention to this subreddit well enough, you'll see all the upcoming PA skins well in advance so you can know what to be saving for. The best ones (model changes instead of recolored textures) are for specific PA's. They're usually cheaper since they're for a single PA model instead of a bundle of shitty texture changes for all the PA's.
---
I thought it was a piece of shit too but when I did finally get it, everyone's negative reviews/ opinions lowered my expectation so much and i turned out to really enjoy it it's the only game I've played since i got it about a month ago (until borderlands 3 comes out)
---
  I wouldn't worry about calendar time - you play when you can.  
---
(It took me a year to complete FO NV, and I think 6 mo for FO 4. )
---
In 76, it took me about 200 hours to make 45.
---
Part of the challenge is figuring out the most effective weapon for various critters.  
---
  I melee'd my way through wendigo cave - worked better on the mirelucks than ballistic weapons, even better than armor piercing automatics.
---
Fusion cores - use one of your play sessions to do a farming run.  
---
You dont have to take a power station just (re)visit the spawn sites.
---
There are a couple in the forest that may have 3 in close proximity.  
---
Theres a spot in the ash heap where 2 PA stations literally across the street from each other, and I found 2 cores @ each.
---
Batteries Included redcuces core weight to 0.3 - @L50, you'll get the perk to reduce overall drain (dont reecall its name.    In between, you'll get a "sprinting uses less power core" perk.
---
Should've reported him to a manager for trying to stifle sales
---
Yes and no, scoarched queen is made more for giant teams of players fighting one thing, while the new quest is more for less people
---
The way the engine works and the extra duty on servers to make it work make it nearly impossible.
---
The only times you’ll really get killed is in survival mode but that’s where it is supposed to happen, otherwise the community is great and helpful toward each other
---
sure! adding you right now
---
thanks for your business! :) Have a good day!
---
Now I just need a plushie 🤣
---
holy crap I need it now
---
On a massive cliff overlooking my house in the Savage Divide, what was weird was that he was staring directly at my house, and wasn't hostile to me, I got up close and got a really nice picture.
---
Maybe it's because I worship him and I have a secret tomb built into that house that has the statue in it.
---
Leaked Mole Miner Civil War DLC
---
Yeah only see the dragon t45 nukashine is cool but it’s only excavator and X-01. I would get the dragon one but I don’t even wear t45 lol.
---
Well I found the reason for recent reports of increasement in this procedure. I don't play adventure much tbh.
---
It says 2 level 50+ PCs but I'm a level 58 that is as badly set up as a 20 except for in medical perks. So a group of 4 or a group of two squads of 4 would shred tue dungeon.

I realize my evidence is anecdotal, but it's based on a far bigger sample size than "it happened to me, though" comment. All you're doing by making such a low-effort comment is showing that you've either fallen victim to the false-consensus effect, or are to self-absorbed to have a reasonable discussion.
---
We can only hope Bethesda answers in the affirmative and gives the people what they want 😅
---
Downvote me all you want but the hate was deserved at launch. Good thing is that Bethesda started listening to its community and began to build the game players wanted.
---
Nah i get. I visit Mac's farm and Bootlegger's shack fairly often to make my cranberry relishes and I often see legendary enemies near that grove so i still think it's a best way to get it done since SBQ doesnt really work at all. It's just for some reason yesterday RNG gods decided to be total dicks.
---
Isn’t the ultra cute armor just an excavator power armor with that hello kitty you skin on it?
---
And I'm just over here wishing that I could complete the event **ONCE**. I beat the sheepsquatch event once but died right before I got credit and had a glitch where I couldn't respawn, the camera just circled my dead body on the sheepsquatch impostor corpse. I got to watch everyone loot as I had to exit the game to get out of the glitch. After that, I have been in about 6 of them now, all failed...
---
I simply can't get all the pylons and kill the damn thing myself.
---
You should take a look at the mounted animal wall decorations that were added with Shear Terror.
---
Being wanted isn't a punishment, it's a game mechanic. There are definite issues with how the mechanic works, but being able to profit off fighting off waves of people that come to take your 500 cap bounty is legit. Being able to profit off killing people that come to take your 10 cap bounty is not
---
The Brotherhood shows his many thanks to the Fallout Gods. May Our Brotherhood Camps shine in a cloud of Fire and Atom!
---
Exactly!
---
I just want the imposter outfit, but No one wants to take the pylon damage so I'm stuck doing all 3 and fighting at the same time.
---
I just want to be able to place them on fences and defensive structures while we are at it.
---
It’s not acid, since scorch beasts are bats it’s more of a Sonor blast
---
Don't log out of the game anywhere near whitesprings. Its pretty much nuked 24/7.
---
Assume this will happen. Take precautions.
---
I know it's in there, sadly I have yet to unlock it
---
Dude, with the track record they’ve got right now they’d make that thing out of flea ridden burlap and piss soaked cotton.
---
I don’t get how I see so many people take 5 shots from my TSE shotgun then turn around as if Unphased and before I even hear their gun go off I’m dead.
---
Sierra Bravos are the worst thing in all of Appalachia. Fuck them, and fuck their queen.
---
Nope, can't attach premade mods since the patch.
---
You won’t always get milk from it now. They don’t like being constantly milked.
---
Sentinel doesn't work for all damage types. You still take full bleed damage, poison damage, and others. Sentinel armor is a mechanic, not an easy button
---
oh man I could see this getting abused new characters being made just to be "wanted slaves" where they get wanted to generate caps for people
---
Isn't that what we would find in a stuffed animal version of it in the game anyway? 10/10 for immersion.
---
Problem is in a game with PvP PC players would have a huge advantage. You can aim much faster and with more accuracy with a mouse compared to a stick.
---
  First time I did it, the SB wasn't there, but there were high level mutants. 
---
Second time, there was a SB, but it was busy taking out the mutants and distracting the Sentrybot patrolling the street.
---
  Gave me enough time to complete the quest interference free.
---
And then I went after the SB :)
---
We need more faction themed camp items!!!
---
this was one of the first things i looked for in the settings and i was sad to not find it
---
Unlike some people, I never once said I wanted my money back, and nor do I now, FO76 is not perfect, but it's much better than I ever expected from an online Fallout.  
---
And yes, I have met far more friendly players than overly aggressive players that just want to goad you into PvP.  
---
Fallout 76 is still young, but it's growing well.
---
I would also like to thank the player that left me tons of junk and aid. I was playing on survival and saw a guy then i accidentally shot in his direction and he ran off. After that i've noticed he left a huge bag on the floor. So-  thank you !
---
Well its a given with the fact it was somewhat of a new idea for them.
---
I heard prime fissure doesn't count which is stupid.
---
Don't wanna try it now ? No pvp in adventure mode after all (well with pacifist mode at least)
---
I had a level 15 character for my first time in Survival, when it first came out. Had no weapons but what I picked up and was able to kill multiple level 100+’s with an auto pipe rifle. The level balance is surprisingly good. 
---
The players who can kill you in one or two shots while never taking damage when you’re  level 10 will be able to do the same thing when you’re level 80. 
---
The imbalance is in the gear.
---
I'm not so sure about that. I don't play ESO online but i know that bethesda contributed to that  so it's all that new since eso online is a few years old by now
---
I used to come there more often than that. It was rarely empty.
---
TBH its more frustrating to me that i spend most of the time running around reviving people and then dont have loot rights on the boss.
---
maybe i should be hiding instead
---
Lol. Your sneeze was funnier to me because it was a title error and caused a "What" reaction and then the re-read really made it humorous.
---
The whitesprings used to have a very prevalent bug where the robots would keep spawning and there would be way too many I miss being able to sit of a roof and watch 50 mr handy janitors yell at me and attempt to get to me
---
Wow, that's quite the conclusion you've drawn. Sorry you're having such a bad day.
---
Yeah that make sense. They're only hard atm if you come across a group of super mutants with a few legendaries. I also feel behemoths should always be 3*
---
You can change the flashlight color to anything you want in the ini file. I set mine to white which is 10000% better than the green.
---
My friends and I saw him as we were crossing mountains in the savage divide, trying to get to whitespring overencumbered. We stared at him for a moment, then killed him for the kill cryptids challenge.
---
Lol
---
Thank you for this. I used this list almost daily before Bethesda decided to just have all vendors share caps.
---
Good, I’ve never believed in listening to others in regards to a video game. It’s always best to find out for yourself.
---
That' not what she said!
---
Quick question I’m unclear on.  
---
Can one person be the conduit for multiple pylons then ?
---
Or my home state of Ohio. The Ohio River adventure screams out of state dlc
---
glowing ones is from a nuke launch and then goes away takes longer for the nuked plants and enimies to go away
---
I carry a Dragon on my unarmed. I can knock the hell of the SB with it until it lands or shoot it out of the sky.
---
Next time say hello and be polite, even in the Wastelands survivors love etiquette :D
---
Before the Nukashine update I made about 30-50 atoms a day, after the update I made about 10-30 atoms a day. After the Lying Lowe update I've made 10 atoms total since it came out...
---
I got 3 from Whitesprings, but in about 1000 drops as I don't use them. I suggest crafting one or two, perhaps buying one from vendors (with any effect) and keep farming. My experience is that having one in stash/inventory increases the item drop chances of that particular item/legendary effect. Note though that if you stash a lot of other things, those get boosted too so the relative drop chance boost might not be that impressive for the LMG.
---
Your post actually made me wanna try it again. Is there a way to start a new character?
---
The key for is to not rush it. Take your time and explore, read and listen to the story. A fair few people rushed out of the gates, were over lvl 100-150 in a couple of weeks and then said they were bored.
---
It’s been the case for me, twice.
---
This is what I don’t get. Surely other players attacking you isn’t a sign that the game is bad? Isn’t that the point of multiplayer free roam? The chance that someone might be hostile
---
Yeah I've got a few. Would just like to get my hands on him. I'll be in my camp busy making ammo or repairing things. I'll hear all my turrets going of and head outside thinking "what the hell is that" que danger music and then I see it's him flapping his wings around. 9 times out of 10 he flys off once I'm outside but then he comes back thr next day and does it again. It's psychological torture 🤣
---
They should do a trophy hunter mission, where you go and hunt down crytids etc with a view to take them and turn them into wall mounts
---
What platform are you on?
---
PC
---
I'm on console so will have to wait patiently to see if we will ever be able to change it.
---
RIP 😅 I'm on PlayStation
---
You can a  repair kits from drops and the other from the atom shop. That's not false information.
---
That your camp in the background? I like it
---
Dude, always turn pacifist on for scorched earth events. It so crazy down there I'm often using my compass and eliminating red dots. Not to mention your slap damage could tip my bloody build over the edge cause I'm hovering at 15 hp. You REALLY don't want to piss off a bunch of high level queen fighters
---
This feels like a no brainer
---
Oof
---
Oh, you better believe I’m dumb enough to try it solo! I’ve done everything else solo in the game, with the exceptions of SBQ and a couple of events. My biggest problem is my friends hardly ever get to log in, so I’m forced to do a lot by myself.
---
Hey we can't all afford a Cadillac
---
&gt;since all my friends hate a game they've never played
---
Dude I feel that
---
Wait no ahahahaha that’s the Thunder Mountain Power Plant
---
It’s not terrible. At least once every time I play I get a glitch or crash that just totally ruins it. Other than that I really have no complaints.
---
Oh oops woosh me
---
Oh ^^ my bad
---
I didnt say that was his intent. I asked if that is what we are supposed to believe happened.  The asultron is an advanced killing machine,  had it simply reverted back to that Calvin would have been killed almost instantly. Instead we got a good 10-20 seconds of wait what are you doing, stop, and repeated screaming, followed by the asultron bahing. Which means it still had the sheepsquatch programming installed.
---
It’s ok ;0 no fret brother
---
No only mods you have to go to vendors or find a plan
---
I'd love to see Columbus or Cincinnati
---
The fun part is that you can do that by modifying the color values in the .ini files on pc.
---
Yup
---
You're not set up right if you're using hundreds of rounds. My crit commando build can take one down in under 40 shots. Level 55 at the time. 
---
Oh, it is a Furious rifle but there are plenty of videos of players using non-legendary combat rifles doing the same thing.
---
What platform? I think I have one I can give you if on PS4 :)
---
This experience is very relatable, bought it about 2 months ago now, expecting great risk because €60 isn't nothing, at least for me. But I was pleasantly surprised, it's so much better than expected. Sadly most of my friends are on the bandwagon as well. But, I've almost convinced two of my friends, so they may buy it. It's their choice, obviously.
---
Hes "in the game" hes just not set to spawn
---
Nerd rage, bloody mess, adrenaline, adrenal reaction, tenderizer.
---
Find any perk that boosts damage and equip as high a tank as you can.
---
Just having my state immortalized in a fallout would be enough for me. But Cinci would definitely be the best. So much is there. Museums Baseball fields Corporate buildings ect
---
I like this theory. This is definitely what Calvin and the people from Bysshe were trying to do.
---
I find Shotgun blasts to the face knocks em down.. LOL
---
We'll have to see what balance the Legendary Vendor brings to the game. If it's trade-in based then all the 1\* drops will start to be worth something.
---
Every time I've don't the BOS and need to walk down the highway in the Mire I was ganked by SBs. It took me forever on my first play through because my non-PA toon couldn't deal enough damage. Level 35ish. And that was before the SB spam nerf.
---
i agree but more aim-assist could fix that I guess 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Always dropped them. I've got half my prime plans from normal scorchbeasts.
---
uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.. passive aggressive uh uh uh uh uh
---
Well that's annoying.
---
What in God's holy name are you blathering about?
---
They should make an emblem creator so we can make our own faction logos and then put them on flags and other stuff
---
Would love at least some faction flags. You could advertise yourself as a Responders post or something.
---
And Butcher's Bounty
---
Nobody can attach mods to anything right now. It's broken. Sucks, but just have to wait.
---
No no no no no no. First, let's make it fucking work. Then we can worry about making it better 🤣
---
Everyone is susceptible to greed
---
Exactly- they never found it, so we need to pick up where they left off
---
Huh?
---
Ill be on around 1pm. The beret it 1k as it was a rare drop during the event and I only have one. Each mask is 150 and each plan is 250
---
Yea I would love for it to happen since I play on PC and have lots of friends on xbox, and I’m sure they could implement certain things to help make it more fair.. hopefully they figure it out at some point.
---
Wow, yeah, that's...and I thought MY RNG was bad. You ought to win a prize, or something. :(
---
It's wild for sure. When they were doing the increased cryptid event Mothman used to Grace me with his presence inside my house. Don't ask me how he opened my doors to get inside. Fuzzy physics. 🤷‍♂️
---
Great advice. I agree that melee is a bad idea against the sheepsquatch. She seems to drop even the best of builds when she can close in on them.
---
I might add: team up if you can. I always run with team medic shared. It makes a word of difference. With a full team, you end up using stims much less. Even w one other person you’re using them half as much.
---
If you have someone willing, robotics expert can also make this a very quick battle. Our fastest runs have been w 4 players: One w robotics expert just running around pacifying the bots. The other 3 just tag the pylons then open up on her. With level 3 team medic being shared and a robotics expert we have not lost anyone yet.
---
I have keycards if anyone wants to team up and hop the event later tonight.
---
Yeah I think you can have up to 5 characters on one account. There's a double xp weekend starting on the 25th if you want a flying  start.
---
Sent friend request
---
When did you try to kill her last time? There seems to be a nerf/glitch since patch 8 where she doesn't scale anymore but has a flat 70% damage ignore.
---
Kill things. Loot them. Sell the loot.
---
This is why I exercise breathing on a regular basis. Ain't nobody waiting on that. 🤣
---
Don't say something bad about Bethesda on here.. the down voters will destroy you.
---
Deploy your armor instead of dropping it.  It will keep the name and you don't risk losing it.
---
I play 50/50 by myself or with friends. The great thing about playing alone is you can take your time exploring and dwelling into the story via holotapes, terminals, etc. My friends always want to rush through lol
---
Passing this on to the merch designers.
---
how about craft a canteen that holds the water from the fountain....canteens can have levels like weapons and armor... higher lvl holds more doses of water per canteen...
---
*Mothman shooting noises*
---
Have you seen the scorched mirelurks yet at the ranger district office that are labeled "Radroach" and drop radroach meat? Or the dead deathclaw at the random encounter labeled "merchant"? Lolz
---
Exactly, and I feel like it might not be too difficult to implement.
---

---
Omg that's fucking sick I'm buying this shit
---
There has to be something coming with them. I need an explanation why I hear a creepy little laugh every time I pick one up!!
---
😂
---
Lol so true
---
Y'all will make tons. You literally made a new mascot second only to power armor. Iconic really.
---
I play in survival and I'll admit, I've taken bags during Encryptid.  To get stimpacks to use on myself and others.
---
Are they ranged or melee enemies? And I went a bit north where there are crossings over the various ditches. You have to kinda lead them to the crossings so they can path to you.
---
I ran into so many quests that were bugged, and my camps disappearing, and then there was quest where I had to kill someone but could never do it because everyone I went there the person was dead. The whole game felt like it was trying to keep me away from it and it sucks because I enjoyed the mechanics and everything
---
To an extent I agree but it's because there's very little ingame that really pushes PA. You can happily do a non nuked Whitespring in level 15 Raider PA. The difference starts to show with the heavy hitters. Sheepsquatch and SBQ will smack the shit out of you in excavator a lot faster. I imagine the burrows will be similar.
---
Gamestop employee did this to me too... I wasn't buying the game, I already had it... I was just talking about ATOMs I think I saw the prepaid cards and I didn't know they had those so i remarked on it. Dude would NOT shut up about "If you're buying Cosmetics in THAT game for extra money, you have bigger problems"   
---
like... dude... You're a retail employee. You're supposed to sell me stuf, not tell me not to buy stuff... He didn't know I played the game, but he was shitting all over it wearing a Gamestop shirt. Not a good look for the company.
---
Works just fine for me and all my firends this is probably a personal property with your PC
---
That's great.glad you didn't listen to other people's bullshit. The games come a long way but it still has issues. I like to give any lower level legendary items I get to new players, some lucky dog last night got a sentinel piece and a chameleon piece. Maybe I'll see you out there in the wastes
---
Why are you trying to drop it?  To give it away?  If so, you need to remove the paint first.  If you're just trying to use your armor, you need to deploy it (place it).  Then it appears in front of you, is owned by you and will eventually return to your inventory automatically if you don't recall it.
---
If you drop it, anyone can take it, or you could be kicked out of the server and lose it.
---
I’ve done killed her once and her body disappeared :( I don’t know how often that happens to others though.
---
Maybe Xbox and PS4 crossplay would be okay but i wouldn't want it with PC due to the different input methods, different settings and hackers/modders etc.
---
Same thing happened to me sell it something anyway and it will work
---
No. Everyone randomly freezes. Someone is frozen and killed in the air.
---
Welcome to West Virginia! It's a fun place to be, and honestly despite all the people shitting on it, it is quite fun! I've met lots of higher level people, and everyone has been very nice. Including a high level who came to my defense as I was running for my life from a horde of scorched.
---
Welcome.
---
Ultra Cute PA? Where can I find that?
---
I was skeptical at first seeing these, but then my friend bought it and built his.
---
When I went to see what activating it would do, I was sold.
---
I've had radrats with the sentry bot red light coming out of their mouths that exploded on death.  Dropped sentry bot loot too.
---
One star nocturnal wooden leg I win!
---
I've done it all in excavator with very little issue. Sheepsquatch smacks the shit out of you regardless of what you're wearing, SBQ is a pushover. I do her without stimpacks pretty regularly.
---
My very first thought. Was hoping someone on Etsy or something would be bangin out some customs
---
Bring the dipshit level down a bit before you try interacting with others.
---
How easy do you want it to be tho it will be boring if there where no challenge
---
Good job, think for yourself and don't listen to the crybabies, I found once you get to around level 20 or so you get hooked
---
I hope they bring in more faction content for endgame and PVP. I would love to murder you and burn  your house to the ground in payment for your kinds sins.
---
Hmm I have a few friends on PC and they can run it just fine. No lag no freezes no nothing
---
It wont let me cause hes at 0
---
I looked, sadly none of them were quite decent enough. If Bethesda doesn't monetize on it. Someone else will.
---
Pulling a rain boom in your jetpack. I'd love a rainbow skin for power armor.
---
Somebody can correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think anybody in adventure mode can attack you anymore. They removed slap damage entirely, so you are now invincible to player attacks until you fight back, initiating PvP, or until you claim a workshop. All they can do is annoy you with constant attacks or trash your camp, but then they will start racking up a bounty for anything they destroy
---
So you want the mechanic that gives you free premium currency to be quick and easy. That sounds more like you want an allowance than challenges.
---
Right on I'm 7 RN so just starting off lol
---
mothman .. uh.. finds a way
---
I hope you enjoy it, as well as all the upcoming content, I really do
---
I've had good luck by milking them from as far away as I can. If I run up to them and try to milk them, they turn hostile (I think due to having Plague Walker, even though I have no diseases so it's doing no damage), but if I slowly edge towards them and milk them as soon as the prompt shows up I've had a 100% success rate, even with the recent reduction. I'm not getting 5 milk every time like I used to, but I'm getting something every time and they're not turning hostile or even kicking.
---
I talked to someone IRL who went on this rant that some youtube fanboy who bought the game didn't like it and how could I dare enjoy it 
---
I asked why would I care what a youtube person say when I have played it myself and asked him how he could dare comment on a game hes never played - as he went to speak 3 other people said they played fallout and it was great (was in a game store) and he slinked off
---
Please... 4 -5 people can kill the imposter in minutes.
---
Maybe. Xbox or ps4? Or pc lol
---
Agreed. I felt for a while the challanges were supposed to be fun, sometimes tied to something seasonal in real life, and easily attained. It gave Bethesda a chance to show us places we havent gone or do things we haven't done. But the amount of time burned for essentially 10 cents worth of atoms isn't worth it sometimes. The game of chance (rad storm, ants never showing up, legendary are rare esp near fissure) isn't my cup of tea. I like strategy and planning not rolling the dice.
---
Xb1
---
What about the other loot though? I completed it for the first time yesterday and got a t-45 jetpack plan. I know that can't be a guaranteed spawn, but between the massive xp from killing all those lvl 50 robots and a legendary and the end-event rewards, there has to be some value to it.
---
I haven't, no. Sounds humorous.
---
Hazmat suits vary from level 1 to level 50, depending on source and RNG. The portacabin type structure on top of posidon power plant gives low level ones, though i can't remember what level off the top of my head, and completing the quest 'tracking unkowns' should always give a level 1 Prototype hazmat suit as a reward. 
---
The only difference between Lvl 1 - 50 is durability, and the only differnce between normal and prototype is colour.
---
Sounds like they tried to cross the picket line and things got out of hand.
---
Agreed. I'm not from Ohio but when I get to the Ohio River in game I just sit and stare into the abyss wishing I could enter it!
---
But do you take full energy damage?
---
Cause that's pretty much the only thing I need to know. If the answer's a no, then boom good way to tank pylons without dying in 5 seconds. Considering nobody does DOT damage in this event, I don't really have to worry about much except for the Baaaaaaad girl
---
This. 
---
Don't think i've ever logged out there outside of PA or a hazmat suit since beta ended &gt;&lt;
---
Dope, im on occasionally if you ever wanna play. Drop your gt and I'll hit you up some time.
---
He's passive aggressively insulting me for being passive aggressive. It takes a certain type of autism to behave like that, I recommend just moving on with your life.
---
I bought this game not too long after launch and had mixed feelings about it at first.  Lately, I can't stop playing it!  The world is just so expansive and there's so much grinding to do! love it! Welcome to Appalachia friend!
---
Yh cos as we all know  there underground and overground 😂😂😂
---
Turning in tech data I got the shielded plan and the knight paint job in one day!
---
Love those days.
---
The imposter, yeah. I doubt they'd go through the effort of setting up a staging area and unique mechanics for it to only exist for like a week
---
There are PvE people who play survival but play it smart and enjoy themselves. They do it from lower leves too. If you don't feel familiar with and efficient in given environment, you aren't in position to make it better with your suggestions. What you suggest would make it worse for many people who want to play it hard from low level.
---
It will happen!
---
Agreed!  I'm all for upping the difficulty of dailies but, players should be able to complete them without server hopping.  As high-level players who have completed all of the quests, dailies are the end game content for my husband and me.  We generally play a few hours every night after work and more on the weekends if we don't have any other commitments but, when half of the time we play is spent on load screens because we have to constantly server hop it really kills our desire to play.  We used to be able to complete all dailies and weeklies, lately, we have been lucky if we can do 2 dailies a night and even completing those involves a serious grind.
---
We hopped probably 10-15 times each last night trying to find path to enlightenment.  We found it once with 3 minutes left on the clock...even with two of us we couldn't get enough biofluid in that time (no toads) but, were at least able to kill the required number of fireflies.  The night before we did the same trying to get the event at the Sons of Dane compound to pop up with no luck at all.  If Beth wants to continue with these types of quests than they need to at least make sure they spawn consistently so, players can do them.
---
The other frustrating ones are the ones that are near impossible like kill something during a radstorm...seriously?  I can recall maybe 3 of those in hundreds of hours of gameplay.
---
Sorry for the rant it is just incredibly frustrating and is killing my desire to play.
---
careful picking up too much loot.... you might get banned
---
minnnnnnne too! i’m lvl 128ish? all my friends are 80&lt; &amp; all they want to do is server hop for ________ (legendaries, sheepsquatch etc) then get mad at the game if X didn’t happen. NOT the reason i got FO76. i only bought a ps4 to play FO4 and now FO76. i love the exploring and the discovering new things. i’m on ps4. edtjustin. let’s be friends and free roam the wilderness.
---
Where's the asterisk?
---
Less if you equip Green Thumb.
---
Can I ask how much big they are? Can I place them on classical columns or they are big like mothman statue?
---
It would be really cool to be able to decorate your camp with flags of different nations indeed - mostly for the interactions it could invite to when stumbling upon someone’s camp and realizing you may be from the same place etc.!
---
Yet
---
I only tried it once but it certainly felt faster to me.
---
Idk why more people don't do this.
---
I always wanted to be able to use the Thirst Zapper and shoot myself in the mouth to restore thirst in fo4 survival 😂
---
I am m to be I
---
Big like mothman.
---
Like have you tried selling to him even though he’s at zero
---
Does troubleshooter's armor work against the imposter?
---
Thank you for the reply
---
You made a null point. Explain to me how "mileage varies from player to player" is not plainly obvious by what I already wrote. I'm expanding on that. I don't see how it's that complicated.
---
Not having a bad day, either. Just being concise. Sorry if that ruffled your feathers, tone sucks with text.
---
Yes, the more everyone knows, the better the outcome for everyone. Like I said, I think maybe the OP has just had bad luck with the other players. It's possible to win this thing short and sweet if at least most of the players know how it works, what they should do and there are enough good weapons there. 
---
After my earlier post, last night I played the event a fourth time. One pylon would not trigger at all, so we only had players on two of the pylons. There weren't a lot of high level players there and I died quite a few times before we ran out of time and we lost the event, lol.
---
Get the Plague Walker mutation. It's completely eliminated any need for disease cures, because it just turns your diseases into a AoE DOT buff.
---
I actually enjoy stacking diseases at this point.
---
I'd say Mothman sized, and about the height of one wall!
---
If you're on Xbox I can show you it.
---
I have this issue too, on PC. I can create mods and attach them no, but purchased or found in the wild cant be added.
---
Yea, but that tato you picked up from a 25 year old lunchbox starts rotting as soon as it hits your pocket.
---
Where did you find it? The only fallout funkos I can find in stores are ones from fallout 4.
---
I never noticed that. Which is surprising for me.
---
It’s good for pvp builds because a lot of people run low hp builds. And they keep that hp low with rads. If you can deal rad damage, it negates any ridiculous resistances they may have, and takes down their health directly.
---
Will only buy if black dust flies out of it when I give him nighttime cuddles
---
Yes, and it says the vendor does not have enough caps...
---
Rise of the rad rats
---
That’s weird srry hat I can’t help
---
VATs is a huge aim assist already
---
No sorry im on ps4. Thanks for the reply
---
Search Amazon!
---
I had a similar experience yesterday.  Was hiding in a cabin as a Scorchbeast soared about trying to get at me.  Luckily, two Yao Guai came along and started attacking the Scorchbeast which gave me a window to run away.  Is there a way to "signal for help" in the game so other players could come assist if you were way in over your head like that?  I tried inviting players to my team but everyone declined.  It would be cool if they had some kind of distress signal you could put out that would alert players on your server of a player in need.
---
The game has always been great, the main problem was connection and stability.
---
If there was you wouldn't need to run it so many times, damaging your armor and requiring you buy more repair kits to keep grinding.
---
Seemed to be working for me. 
---
Get a friend without any extra speed bonuses to crouch next to you whilst one of you has the weapon out, then race to confirm ? &gt;&lt;
---
Yeah, Survival Mode is a higher stakes PvP.
---
Haven't played it yet, probably never will, tbh.
---
I just completed/failed an event that went similarly, pylon one wasn't triggering and there were probably only 6 people there and more than half had no clue. Honestly, the first one in 11 goes that failed but I know I've gotten lucky.
---
You are not, AA aint useless, but aint useful on laser or explosive weapons
---
Jug you never fail to impress. That doorway and garage combo, genius!
---
Pics or it didnt happen...
---
Did 3 fallout 4 play throughs.  Even when I should have wasted the Operators for an ideal perk for a character, I wiped out the pack.  The Operators just spoke to me....
---
Yeah, I've played it four times now and we've won three of the four. The last time, when the group lost, was pretty much carnage the whole time and I spent the most stimpaks on that one, while also dying a number of times. I think the more people learn how to play this event, it'll get easier. I love getting masks, plans and costumes so I wouldn't mind throwing 2K in caps a few times to play this event again. Don't even care about getting a three star anything from it. 
---
Also, if you don't mind my asking, what is Sentinel armor? I see it mentioned online a lot, but  I don't think I've ever seen anything in the game marked Sentinel.
---
Yes no screeching, or cloaking. Last thing I need to do is lose him when I need cuddles.
---
I'm waiting for things to calm down a bit, on here and in the game. I'm in no rush to blow through the new content. Funny, but a lot of the posts I'm seeing sound and feel a lot like the posts people made about the queen back in December. 
---
Too hard, people not helping, loot sucks, I can solo it.... all the same stuff.
---
I’ll eat anything that’s rotten if im starving lol
---
I'd prefer if you can trade x number of cards for the ability to actively chose a perk you really want. Not everything has to be random in this game.
---
True. Maybe the tato just doesnt like your pocket lol
---
I always head straight for the pylons to conduit, as I always have a ton of aid items ready to burn.
---
I'm on PC how about you team up with me. I'll tank all that robot can dish out. You just hit the pylons and do damage. No one's gotta die and them yellow belly vultures can go hungry.
---
If you're on PC and looking for people to play with I also started fairly recently
---
When you go to the mod screen and go to attach the mod it shows you what's required to craft it. Mods essentially give you all of the material and a one time use "plan" ability to attach them.
---
you can find the nuke codes for every silo after they’ve been solved at nukacrypt.com/solved. If you want to work them out yourself you need 8 fragments that are dropped from feral ghoul officers :)
---
Wait... What?!
---
I had no idea.  I just thought this perk blew.
---
:O
---
I get a kick out of folks who have played '100s of  hours since the beta' and still say it is the worst game ever. Yes...that has happened.   Gaming culture is very strange sometimes!
---
As a (usually, solo) melee player, when a mob of critters attacks, I'm going for kills to make sure I survive.  
---
And likely, until there is a pile of bodies and flies around me, I'm too busy swinging to even notice if another player comes in.
---
From that perspective, its not me being rude or selfish or intentionally preventing someone else from tagging for loot, but that I'm not going to risk death just to let someone else get a tag
---
The holotapes are enjoyable to listen
---
https://imgur.com/ZhFOm63
---
I’ve seen animal corpses with the tag of travelling merchant.. I’d like to imagine that the animal ate the merchant 🤣
---
&gt;My hope is that eventually we will discover that there are tactics/builds/ gear/buffs that make this boss not cost 100s of stims.
---
I've played it four times so far, won three out of four and been the conduit once. (The last time one of the pylons wouldn't trigger and we lost. Should have bailed on that one.) Anyway, I've probably spent fewer than 30 stimpaks combined. It's doable.
---
So, you guys aren’t crouching, then going into a full sprint, right?
---
They could even make them heal back to full health once for every star they have.
---
Everytime I got to the vendors they say zero for about 30 secs then the 1400 caps shows up.  Try just clicking trade and wait a minute till the 1400 shows up on the vendor stash
---
Well I have a couple thousand hours invested in the Fallout series myself starting with FO3 and with the exception of FONV have fallen through the world in all of them. Concluding and commenting that anyone who posts a couple of lines on this subject is lying about the experience based solely on your alleged Nexus crawls only goes to show that you, yourself are a "victim" of cognitive bias. Lighten up there Dr. Freud.  Not everyone who says, "Hey, it happened to me." is endeavoring to have an intellectual debate with you on the subject. Meh! Pseudo intellectual pedantry at best.
---
There are also a few \*non human\* NPCs.   I don't thing folks play long enough to find out.
---
Yeah it totally sucks
---
Well it isn't just me finding this tag on corpses it so clearly it did
---
Yup. This will most definitely be fixed in the next patch, but until then let's soak it in. The Dragon lives again!
---
Ha. I play solo. Maybe somebody with friends can test it for me. :D
---
Nah. North east Ohio should be though.
---
Haha true.  Those lunch boxes sure preserve things well eh?
---
DC was hit by at least 5 nukes 25 years ago, pretty sure if we fast travel there we'll melt.
---
Agreed. It's my home state.
---
This is an absolute must. I used to burn through disease cures and antibiotics like crazy but discovered the fountain and it’s all good.
---
It's one of the best games in recent years, now that the major bugs are mostly ironed out. People are just used to being spoon-fed their content. Also remember these simple facts:
---
1) Negativity bias that is human nature (i.e. a simple bug can greatly overshadow an otherwise brilliant game)
---
2) Most people actively seek opinions to reinforce their own rather than seek alternate perspective
---
3) The average gamer, nay, the average PERSON, is a loud idiot who cares more about fitting in than having their own opinion. This is especially true for Generation Y and Z people.
---
The only other mate I had who got the game at launch rushed and got to end-game X-01 power-ar or in like a week, and never played it again. Meanwhile I just got that armour today. Excuse my arrogance but I really believe that not rushing these games is how you play it *properly*. Rushing stuff just makes you miss out on all the tiny charms and technical marvels in the game. The mob AI in particular blows me away.
---
Oh it's beautiful
---
Worked fine for me yesterday, two friends with me had no issues either.
---
Oh shit nice
---
there is probably a mod for where the mod you want to equip goes.
---
I guess you could try to message Assistant Director at Bethesda on twitter: https://twitter.com/gstaffinfection/with_replies
---
I to think that maybe the case.. Roll on May to find out?
---
I'm here just to point out my admration towards this autocorrect intervention.
---
Tbh I don't care for what type of person he is. I like his content, and I'm pretty sure that's okay. I liked Minecraft, and that's a product from notch, so it's safe to say I can like their products but not the people themselves
---
It depends on how often you’re playing otherwise and how much other stuff you’re picking up around the world.
---
Me too.  Slow exploration and taking time to read terminals and listen to holotapes is key to this game and lends itself well to solo play.
---
I think people that play exclusively via multiplayer 'squads' kind of miss out....which is what may have led to some of the massive criticism in the first place.
---
So glad to hear. I played since day one and seen the content grow. There have been many problems but it is in constant development with regular new features and much more to come.
---
Welcome! :)
---
Just a glitch mate. I've seen one myself in the bog area and also once fast traveled back to my camp and all my turrets were named "watoga merchant".
---
What platform?  If it’s Xbox, I’d love to come and watch!
---
Nah we'll be fine we nuke Appalacia numerous times daily.
---
I wasn't aware that there were Enclave remenants near my Brotherhood Chapter. I will have to have my knights investigate this.
---
Pylon One was the one that wouldn't trigger in the event I did, too. Ugh.
---
i fucking wasted an hour last night of my limited playtime waiting by a fissure,killing scorched and scorchedbeasts but no #@@%% legendary ever spawned... you'd they  would at least bump up the legendary spawn rates near fissures if they are putting out challenges like this
---
I swear they jsut want us to BUY atoms, not earn them in game
---
Yeah, I have a 2\* Vampire's Combat Knife, with the second effect being the reflecting melee damage back at attacker perk.  Because it's a Fast weapon, I can basically use the bullet sponginess of enemies like Super Mutants against them, stabbing them over and over again to keep my HP up.  I can get through Distant Thunder without any HP loss.
---
ha ha dont worry caught me out as well until noticed after about 15hrs in!
---
Shame it couldn't just be passive and just double the ammount its already going to put in there if you didn't have the perk.
---
Can't we just watch and wait for that store to go under,  these things can only help.  they are awful
---
Most YouTubers or gaming "journalists" are incredibly disingenuous for the sake of clicks. If you've ever played any MMO or MMORPG in your life you'd know that in order to properly review those type of games they need time to power through the first year. You can't get better QA results than thousands of playersintentionally breaking the game. They all know this. Keep in mind, ESO was met with horrible reviews at launch yet no one bothered to revisit the game. There's more profit in negativity. Mark my words a year from now you won't hear or read from a single bandwagon hater giving it a second look.
---
I have the same issue with power armour. No current mod equipped. Makes the noise of being attached but still no mod equipped. Thankfully it doesn't use up the mod.
---
Its a shame that it only comes in level 30.  Pretty much useless for most players.
---
I am on Pc and plant my filthy bottom near the first pylon that is not occupied. Constantly shooting the bots prioritizing the eyebots. I am glad that a fellow vault dweller tanks them. Keep up the good work!
---
I honestly don’t miss the npc’s much anymore. The more you dig into the story, learning from direct survivors of the Great War, it’s actually really fascinating and makes a lot of sense.
---
Here's the thing i didn't articulate clearly and upfront, I don't toggle pacifist mode. Ever. I don't pvp, don't plan to pvp and dislike the dual login screen now to pvp.
---
Either Bethesda turned pacifist mode off during an update as i believe it to be a default setting or others have the means to. Nothing surprises me anymore when it comes to a game with an economy. Lesson learned if you farm junk for caps. PSA: check pacifist mode EVERY login cycle now i guess.
---
Thanks for your insight themadscott
---
I was kinda wishing it wasn't a glitch. Would be a nice expansion off of original fallout lore like the intelligent deathclaws who could speak.
---
Xbox here :) 
---
Just started playing a few days ago and cant seem to put the game down
---
Always looking for others to play with
---
gt: v0rdul
---
Nope. it increses speed whilst crouched. I'll test it out again tonight, but literally the first thing i did with it equipped was sneak race a friend. &gt;&lt;
---
this is why i stopped playing destiny 2, the grind was real....now that shit is creeping into fo76...not good
---
Or they could go up north the river and we could get another Pitt dlc
---
like a relay switch or some shit
---
we're getting too much free atoms, So Bethesda is trying to stop us getting them for free and start buyng
---
Wow, a Quad Lever Action sounds pretty great.  One of the earliest great Legendaries I got was an explosive Suppressor's Lever Action Rifle with a move speed bonus.
---
The move speed aspect seems like it got broken in one of the updates, but while it hit fairly hard, my biggest gripe with it was the tiny number of rounds.  That, and the process for reloading them is a bit weird because it will often stop at 2.
---
If your on xbox, hold the trigger to look through them and hit the vats bumper to zoom.
---
that's one of the things that has confused me. maybe I'm thinking of FO4 but wasn't it that we could replace a mod, say an upgraded receiver, with the "standard" receiver and we'd then have that upgrade available to put on another gun for free?
---
.. maybe it was just a dream..
---
I play on PC and I've been having no issues with it.
---
yeah im kinda almost getting there myself
---
You only get one recall card for free from the quest line. If you want to do it again you have to buy an item from a vendor that costs over 2000 caps and then craft a new card that also requires one stable fluorescent flux.
---
Obviously you can jump in on other people's event for free but if you want to initiate it, it's fairly costly.
---
Hmm the friends part is debatable.
---
They should add the possibility to add custom markers visible to other players, even if just for things like this and not for player vending
---
Do you know if that's wasteland wide? Like the faushnaut event was?
---
Plan can drop from Encryptid.
---
Seems to be a combat rifle with a baked in damage bonus, in addition to the sneak stuff. So it might actually be pretty good. Though personally im just gonna use it for faster movement without appearing on the map on survival so i don't really care about the damage much.
---
The plan drops from a certain event. Tons of 50s floating around.
---
FO76 brings the one thing to the table FO4 did not: Unpredictability. Not just from the other players, but also because it seems a great deal of the spawns are far more randomized. Over this hill am I going to run into a pack of wolves, a couple of Snallygasters, or a Mothman just chilling before disappearing. I don’t know.
---
It's a little anemic compared to the initial releases of Fallout 3 and 4, but it's still a good game.  Community plays a big role in how much I like certain games, and being able to interact with some (no crossplay, dammit) of the community in-game is pretty baller.
---
Yeah Youngstown is practically the second home of the enclave
---
76 is a much better game now than it was months ago, and i can confidently say it'll be a better game months from now. The improvements are noticeable everytime i play. Glad you are on board!
---
Games that don’t continually make money aren’t supported man. You’re not paying a subscription fee and are getting all these new quests and events and features for free. All that stuff costs a lot of money to develop.
---
So cheater legendary armor is allowed but no chems? This is going to be a shit show.
---
Probably just more Mole Miners Wendigos and Mirelurk kings.
---
Yea that would be pretty funny to think that if I came across a firefly or something harmless
---
I used to live in Tennessee; it’s a quick way to tell everyone you’re an outsider.
---
yeah the items themselves are really overpriced
---
Thanks for the info!
---
nukacrypt is providing an essential public service..just like the mods that bypassed DIMA's memories in FO4
---
That would be awesome too. That was one of my favorite dlcs in fo3
---
Wooowwwww awesome 😍
---
After some thorouhg testing recently I can say that Whitespring and Watoga bots are unaffected, other players also fine. The only thing it has caused problems with is a team-mates Brahmin in his CAMP.
---
I suggest placing a Stash box by the road or whatever is on the edge of your camp. That way people would be less leery to enter if they can put their junk away before checking out your camp.
---
yeah 1000 atoms is $10 for a skin, that is ridiculous
---
I ignore DR and ER mostly. Choosing between level 5 leather armor with perfect legendary rolls, vs maximum possible DR/ER roll with crapy legendary effects, I'll always pick the level 5 one.
---
Thanks so much. Ill just carry around a gamma gun for those people. Its a super simple counter.
---
Ok, I noticed ppl standing in train stations asking but I've been leary
---
I have picked up many of the cool items (Mothman statue, Deathclaw rug) and will now 100% be grinding atoms for this.
---
Gonna have to steal that railing idea myself
---
Do you also hangout in the mouth of a dinosaur?
---
Honestly I've never seen such a good mmo community. Something similar like rust is just so mindbendingly toxic so it's a breath of fresh air to actually speak to people. Of course, this is on adventure mode. Survival mode has people camping at fast travel points
---
You can skip the wait by just selling them something anyways. If they have caps available it'll immediately correct to the right amount, and if they don't it'll just say they don't have enough caps.
---
Yea seeing how or even being one of the raiders that took Pittsburgh would be awesome
---
ah, name calling huh? very mature.   i kinda feel sorry for you
---
Well, you should have tried the garbage they released from day one.  Crashing every 5 - 10 minutes. Losing gear and loot and progress. 
---
Look, the game is finally fun but you must reflect and recognize they sold us a game at full price they said would be a great release.
---
It was going to be great because they gave us access to this thing called BETA.  The intent was we break it, they fix it "before release"  however, the BETA was more like a pre-alpha then they sold us Alpha on opening day and the whole thing was literally a straming pile of shit.  Like, nearly unplayable due to crashinyou weren't playing before they broke out the PVP server and the main server.  That's why nobody attacked you.
---
I really cannot stress enough the pile of absolute garbage that FO76 was. It may seem like the ranting, raving and bitching was over blown.  That is only due to the fact that so much was done, they fixed it and then some
---
Probably.  We really need an Inside the Vault that details what services we can actually expect from this thing.  Scrapping Legendaries for tokens is a thing, and spending those tokens to re-roll your other equipment is too, but how much control do we actually have here?  Do I get the ability to target the one perk I don't like?  Or does it re-roll everything and turn into a gamble?
---
My bet is on the most random method possible.
---
Can you make a video next time?
---
me too,  I'm free to group up an help out if you ever see me on, i am often playing with someone but i like doing the missions/quest solo just so i can read things or listen to the holotapes and actually pay attention to it.  some times playing with others gets in the way of the story.
---
my xbox Gt: Wahooooooooooie
---
Reported it to Bethesda the day of the patch, when it started happening. They asked for screenshots and a diagnostic report.. and then told me it's a bug and I need to open a ticket with the devs. Three days wasted, no fix, and this is frankly something they should have caught before releasing the patch.
---
Sometimes I think the biggest problem with Fallout is Bethesda. Is ESO a mess like this?
---
It is larger. If you look at the blackboard plans in Calvin's hidden bot workshop, they put the standard sized frame into a larger structure to make it Sheepsquatch sized.
---
Yeah that's what I'm starting to learn from this post. It seems like it's all about what you can reduce and what you can do other than having the highest amount possible
---
Gunna piggyback here and say I'm looking for an imposter mask, XB. Anyone looking to offload one hit me up.
---
I appreciate it. I really hope it’s not a glitch because it’s a neat gun.
---
I don't mind one aspect to be something you'd never do but all of them are a bit much.  
---
I tapped out of Fallout76 for a while. I might return to the game after the big update. But it went from terrible to better to almost good now it's going downhill again.
---
We don't have a cow. We have a bull
---
https://youtu.be/mUtSazFb5qM
---
and you are either blind to modern corporate bullshit tactics to fleece consumers or you just want to be an ass and argue for no reason
---
To be honest, even tho I may never play FO76 (until I get private self hosted servers!) I would still buy a plushie. I collect them off and on for some games (Companion cube, Charr plushie)
---
All my friends won’t play it either, but I’ve made new friends that do play 76. It’s a fun game. It’s kinda like my new GTA, the only game I will play the entire year likely.
---
Everyone must have been partying with Biv.
---
I don't have anything to add or dispute with your strategy. I just wanted to tell you that it's pretty awesome to see/hear/read about folks teaming up to do stuff together.
---
Changing from time alive to kills is extremely pro grief... Now the higher levels just go out and kill all the lower levels trying to do events... You want kills to be at the top ? Easy, just go kill everyone that can't fight back... People whined about how it was and noww it's worse because people don't think about the logic behind the initial decision...
---
I forget what the line is exactly but you are going to find the section for pipboy rgb and change the decimal code to the color you want, all 1.0 for bright white, or is it 0.0 for white?  one or the other
---
I bought this thing last night. its awesome! i want more full size statues. an the effect it does is great
---
I’d throw my money at that too lol, I’ve also seen some fan art on Twitter of a scorchbeast which would make a good plushie design: https://imgur.com/gallery/w4n8RT7
---
I ordered the Mr Fuzzy plushie and cant wait for it to arrive but a mothman would be fantastic 👍
---
I met 7 and I only played for two days I'll be coming back soon. Made over 30 on gta and another 15 on dying light. Just be nice and help people and you will make online friends. I barely talked to half of them
---
Me and my coworker play nightly. Do you play on PS4, if luck would have it?
---
The guy hosting the fight night should build this
---
yes but i could not use the mod, it was still in my stash box, i could see the components to craft but i only have the plans for the t-60.  that was the part that confused me, could not attach mod but i could see how to craft everything without having the plans
---
There are plenty of car accidents in Fallout 76 already.  I just assumed they had Ohio plates.
---
Ok, you've made it very clear that you believe you are objectively more intelligent than I am, but at the same time you're slinging insults at me and being patronising in every sentence... So tell me, thou with the smartiest of pants, what WAS the point of the comment if not to have a discussion?
---
...now I see your username. Hey, pretty good troll effort man - honestly! Nice to know there are still smart people among your kind :p
---
Upvoted for a wierd, innocuous thing
---
Morgantown airport event is relatively easy,  will give you lots of weapons to scrap, and nearly every room in the hangars has a first aid kit.
---
Wade airport is low level mutants, again lots of weapons to scrap, and a PA spawn, too.
---
wonderglue, economy wonderglue, duct tape, military grade duct tape, handmade glue all scrap to adhesive.
---
or as someone else said, farm:
---
2 corn, 2 mutfruit, 2 tato 1 purified water make vegetable starch at a cooking station.  Veg starch scraps to adhesive.
---
mutfruit grows the slowest, tato the fastest.  Plan(t) accordingly.
---
At launch it was bad, but they slowly fixed it and brought it to a decent state.
---
After a certain point the game feels a little empty but they're adding more stuff each week and it's fun to find new things. 
---
The lack of NPC's at first was kinda a downer but once you realize how little you talk to NPC's in other fallout games(well in my case, I like exploring and quests), you kinda forget about it. 
---
But the community is really nice and makes it worth staying. I've had randoms give me weapons and stuff randomly. It's really cool.
---
Mothman would be a great addition to any plushie collection!
---
Unfortunately I do not
---
Not since the Legion burned it to the ground.
---
All right I'll be in later today
---
Was feeling ultra cute in my power armor. Might delete later.
---
I've am had a blast with this game but it's way better with friends, all of my friends bought the bandwagon  but it's ok bc this game has an amazing community. Making friends on the game  is super easy
---
Mr. Searchy is your friend.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/search?q=mods&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=all
---
But how else will I get a legendary pitch fork and a legendary spear! And an ugly white hat!
---
I’m still low level, like 15 or 16, but I’ve seen the mothman twice, and both times he just fly away?
---
I’m assuming I will fight him at some point?
---
Thanks for the post, I missed this as well.
---
Hell yeah, that scorch beast art is sick
---
You’re still going to take passive damage and that’s essentially how conduit damage functions. Likewise, other damage modifier armor isn’t likely to make any difference to conduit damage (like troubleshooter armor). It’s kinda like how zealot armor is great against the SBQ but her acid attack will still kill you in 2 seconds.
---
Its a great game, for the first week to month depending how you play. Then its a steaming pile of bugs and garbage that seems to be intentionally designed to aggravate you with little to no reward. If you want all the rage of dark souls with they pay out of actually accomplishing anything, you might enjoy 76. I'd love to hear an update when you feel you are done with the game. I keep trying to go back with updates, but I want to hold off until I'm ready for a full restart.
---
Loose mods are currently bugged across the board hopefully beth fixes it before Next week.
---
Ah darn! Well! I’m newish. I got it during the fasnacht event (tried it through Redbox first) but I love it! Especially C.A.M.P building! If you ever just want to even chat about the game and stuff, message me! I’m level 34. My friend is 140
---
I have to play it again. I’ve been playing since launch, but have no one to play with and my boyfriend doesn’t really enjoy playing it.
---
Xbox or PlayStation?
---
You get about three minutes after a post to edit it without getting the asterisk. Also known as a ninja edit.
---
Xb or ps?
---
It's not a bandwagon. It's reality.
---
Am from Youngstown area, can confirm
---
My vendors seem to be at 0 for atleast 2 days now
---
Well thankfully this event can't some limited time affair, they hopefully get there kinds of bugs ironed out.
---
Leave
---
While server hopping queen fights all weekend my three star vamps knuckles disappeared. I assume I dropped them. Thankfully it wasn't my explosive energy weapon. But I am being VERY careful and deliberate with my button pushing now.
---
IMO, it's not so much that "no one wants to take pylon damage" as much as everyone scrambles to evaluate what they are best positioned to do.  I've had cases where it seemed like everyone was on the pylons and no one was attacking the Imposter.  Then she comes after the conduits, they die, and the whole process starts over again.
---
Can't really stop a holes like that currently.  You could build in another area, but that sounds like it would go against what you're doing.  Whenever they extend pacifist to buildings you'll be fine.
---
I haven’t lost a weapon but all my weapons are explosive heavy weapons or your weapon was duped and just removed :/
---
Subtitles: On
---
Ok, I’ll try again. Thank you
---
What's your build? I have X01 PA with about 654 in energy res and a few mutations like grounded and scally. I often am the conduit for all 3 pylons and just sit on the shack roof. I use maybe 6 nuka quantum's, with a fully slotted cola nut perk. It's not that bad.
---
If your a low hp build maybe not be the conduit?
---
TIL, cheers!
---
Yeah in your case it seems to be another bug. I was just replying specifically to the guy saying to just wait a minute for it to show the right value.
---
I'm wondering if there's something that's causing the reset timer to start over for you.
---
I dunno why, but whenever I see him he always fights me. We have a love hate relationship. I love him and he hates me 🤷‍♂️🤣
---
When ever I see this sudden tribal uproar over a game I immediately buy it because I want to make my own mind up. I don't read up on it. I just jump in and see if I can find something I enjoy.
---
This has resulted in some terrible games which i put down but more often than not I get to experience something really fun and different from what I'd usually play.
---
One other amazing thing about this game is the community of players I meet are so nice and helpful. It's great.
---
Yeah I’ve only had to do that type two or three times. Pretty much every other is just straight out of my inventory. I think I’m only missing the firecracker whiskey and the tic blood tequila now
---
Just an hour ago on Xbox I modded a executioners handmade, an unyielding leather leg and my excavator torso, however I had not renamed these items, the gun and armour was new and I only named the chassis on the P.A. I’ve seen the mods not applying issue mentioned a lot since the patch so I’m curious if it’s because of the name changing or if it’s platform specific/pc mods, I would try clearing any custom name and seeing if it makes a difference, might do nothing but could be worth a try I guess 🤔
---
A Mothman plush to go by my Deathclaw plush would be pretty perfect. 
---
We do still need a scorchbeast Funko pop though.
---
Ya know to a degree I can see this, because if you just throw on an unyielding set, you’re gonna win more likely than not. 
---
My bloodied melee build allows me to 1-3 shot people(up to and including scorch beasts)with armor pen depending on my hp.
---
Give it time. It'll wear off hahaa
---
It grates on me a little bit whenever people say the game is better now than when it came out.  Its less buggy, true, but saying its better now implies they needed some content to change to make the game good.  They didn't.  The content was always what it was supposed to be.
---
My lever action is like that too. Fastest 20 shot reload I’ve ever seen lol
---
I bet it's in the works. There is now way they aren't going to make a giant sized scorchbeast funko
---
Let's not forget the 3 levels in one day bs.  Which is irritating at 195.
---
What you are doing is admirable and a positive contribution to the game and community, but unfortunately, those who gain enjoyment out of making others miserable cannot be stopped from continually attempting to do so.
---
Don’t complete it until you’re lvl 50 or higher. You get a really good gun from it and if you complete it now it’ll be low lvl
---
I can apply craftable mods, but not premade one
---
yeah i never saw path to enlightenment pop the entire i played last night, i checked constantly
---
The entire point of video games is to play and be rewarded while playing either by points or items. How could you defend a game for making activities barely worth your time (which you're doing Bethesda a favour by playing anyways) and in game currency (which should be easy and plentiful to obtain.)
---
The loot mechanics of this battle are pretty lame.  If you ran around doing the conduits and never got a shot in on the boss, you won't get any loot from her, which is often a Legendary separate from the one the event rewards you.
---
ive already seen him near my house multiple times. i was gonna kiol him once but i failed because i didnt have enough health.
---
Dude, what is the deal with the rolling pins?!?! I've gotten one 3\* all week and it was a damn instigating, fast swing, +1 strength rolling pin!!! You are the 5th person not counting myself that has gotten one apparently lol.
---
Sure would make it a skeptical.
---
I'm on XBOX, I'll have to check there. Thanks!
---
I remember about a week ago I told someone I played and they were immediately taken aback and remarked "Why!?  Its such a bad game!"  Surely enough, when I asked if they had played I got a much calmer "Well, no..."
---
I think the best way to stop griefing is to go through the seven stages of denial as quickly as possible.
---
Agree.  I soak up a lot more environmental story telling playing solo.  I tend to gravitate toward different activities solo vs grouped.
---
he runs away at some point.
---
I think some people don't understand that it's ok not to enjoy a something and feel the need to then attack everyone that does.
---
He probably did the cost-benefit analysis you should have. He knows he only has 10 caps to lose. You should have known you had 170 to lose. It’s usually best not to bother with the small bounties.
---
i hated that quest to kill that guy that was already dead,  kinda forgot about it honestly despite going there countless times to do it.  you will still see an occasional bug.  last night i saw a floating ghoul with no head.  He was also invincible, but wasn't attacking just hanging out (literally) in a parking lot
---
The level action does reload each billet individually. Having 20 rounds vs 5 rounds really does have a big effect. If you were stopping at two it might be you are pulling the trigger too early. The shotgun is the same way, if you pull the trigger before done reloading it will stop and start firing before it fills up.
---
I bought FO4 around Xmas time and was immediately underwhelmed but I haven't been able to articulate exactly why yet as I have only gotten to diamond city so far. I just got FO76 about a month or two ago when I was 60% off and I immediately loved it *way* more than 4. Sure I haven't been on since launch, ok. But I still have yet to experience half the shit people claim to make it a bad game currently -except of course on day one right after a stranger built me a sweet camp w water purifier and someone launched not one. Not two. But 3 nukes on whitesprings. My camp was juuuuust on the edge of the blast radius and I only just now found enough nuclear waste to repair my nuclear reactor...that sucked
---
Oh yeah there is also hundreds of Repair Kit posts here
---
Unfortunately there's not a lot you can do to completely prevent situations like that currently. You can block the abusive players and jump servers and I think you can move your camp and the broken stuff should be repaired when you place it back down. For things like decontamination showers it's definitely cheaper to spend the caps to move your camp rather than the materials.
---
I say "I think" because there's been some folks on this subreddit saying that was changed at some point, but I've done it numerous times to get my destroyed planted crops back (tatos, corn, and mutfruit for crafting vegetable starch) and I'm pretty sure I didn't have any in my inventory or stash that would have been used for repair costs.
---
On the bright side however, Bethesda has stated there will be another change to pacifist mode in the future that will make your camp invulnerable. No idea if they've said exactly when they plan to implement that change though.
---
Lays eggs from a strange orifice
---
my god man just stop, you are making yourself look bad...very bad
---
Always found it odd that melee players expect to be invisible at lest a sniper uses cover and distance as could a mid range shooter
---
I've played solo my entire experience with random groups low level groups inviting me for help. I'd definitely stay solo, your tasks are more focused and it's much more immersive.
---
I'm online, but I can't join your world, it's full!
---
Put your junk in the stash before going there.
---
I mean, really, the event will still be there in the minute or two it takes to load to Lewisburg and then to the Pylon site.  This battle is so sloppy that not dying is almost a matter of luck more than it is skill.
---
The best thing about columbus here is that they wouldn't need to change anything but the nuclear cars.
---
Ah right, il have to check and see if the consumable medic pump has gone from my stash or whether I crafted it as I think I know the plan for that, hope it gets sorted soon
---
Maybe a shorter version, but I am all for this idea. I think it’s awesome lol
---
then join any other world and i'll try joining you
---
It's not impossible dude, Second Life for example has plenty of these type of items from [camera and album packs](https://marketplace.secondlife.com/p/photo-book-1/4164857), to [huds](https://marketplace.secondlife.com/p/camera-share-view/3430497) for recording/sharing video, even live and so on....
---
Putting an RNG system on fucking perks was a terrible development choice. That's the real travesty.
---
He will return.
---
You shouldn't have to play like a Pidgeon to get ahead
---
Oh yeah! I was getting killed in loading screens, I got attacked by invisible enemies, sometimes my guns healed enemies instead of hurt them. It was just a laggy, buggy mess and I felt gypsy’d for having to pay for a game that bad
---
If it was duped it would have already been removed. Probably a bug
---
I think ESO was a Zenimax thing, not a Bethesda thing. 
---
Fallout 76 is Bethesda first online game and really, they should have asked Zenimax for help at first.
---
Idk why many people consider contesting a workshop in adventure as griefing, it’s clearly stated that claiming a workshop puts a PvP target on your back. 
---
The game makes it easy enough to farm resources. If you want to make it even easier by claiming a workshop, then you should accept the consequences, mainly being that you might have to pvp. 
---
I see nothing wrong if the consequences and slight risk of pvp come to fruition from the ease of resource farming workshops every now and then.
---
And to be fair, I used to be the guy who’d claim a shop only to be slayed by a higher level. To solve this problem, I simply practiced my pvp on survivor mode and adjusted my build a little. 
---
And for full disclosure, and this might result in some downvotes on this particular thread, I hand to Jesus made 2,500 caps off workshops in adventure in about thirty minutes.
---
*resurrect* isn't there one map that's missing?
---
Only thing you can do is server hop. And unless you're keeping you decon shower open to all users keep it stored.
---
I feel your pain here on xbox and I really hope that it gets addressed as it's not only an inconvenience but an annoyance as well.
---
PC :(
---
Many others have said it on this subreddit both in this post as well as others, but the simplest solution seems to just cut off cap loss per level at level 50. Hopefully since Survival is still in Beta they'll eventually land on that solution.
---
I join when it pops up. The instant I load into it I sneak hop on the building and start shooting at all the other robots. Once its some what clear I chase after the imposter with my explosive shotty only to have a huge swarm of eyebombs spawn right in front of me killing me. At this point I go back on the building to clear out more robots. Repeat doing that but I do die during it. Wouldn't bother me but I either freeze during the loading screen after respawning or the game messes up and no matter how many times I hit x to respawn it doesn't let me. Just a corpse with a camera circling it. Have had people say don't be over encumbered and in power armor or that will happen. But am I in power armor and encumbered? nope I don't even carry power armor and I go to the event with at least 100 pounds to spare. I have encountered other players with the same issues. So in all just really really issue filled event for me.
---
This. A gamma gun with deep dish does wayyyy more rad damage but it’s harder to aim
---
I was under the impression no one *wanted* to be on the top of these leaderboards.
---
I was the same with the Operators, I liked their way of working and how they were more organized, however I would always wipe the Disciples, jus they seemed chaotic, they felt like at any time they could backstab my character, the Pack was more of a animalistic tribe so once they established you were the Alpha they would follow you to death.
---
Ah okay, yeah I'm not sure either, I've mostly been playing for like 2-3 hours after work each day, and today I got work off. But i wasnt able to use the shop yesterday or today so far
---
Good to know! Thanks for putting in the effort
---
Yes, all hail Mothman.
---
I agree, But don't worry I say we're get them soon. Sometime in the "Nuclear winter" as it does say new features and we're be able to raid vault 94 which if you check the terminal it does say all systems are normal. so there could be vault dwellers in there.
---
Reminds me of the good old days of Fallout 3. You never knew what you would get around the corner.
---
Do you have the staggering perks? Cause when those bastards are flying around non stop shaking their screen I just spam bullets with my AR cause I'd imagine my shotgun wouldn't reach
---
Sold.
---
I feel like the game’s been out long enough that most people should be able to make the quick cost-benefit analysis. If they’re a 500+ cap bounty, chances are they’re a skilled player or playing without caps. They’re probably not worth bothering with. If they’re a low cap bounty, it was probably an accident or they’re trying to minimize their loss on death. In both situations, there’s little to gain from confronting them. 
---
It’s a mechanic, not a punishment. If Bethesda meant for it to be a punishment, there would be an element that gave unwanted players an advantage over wanted players. There isn’t. I don’t think there ever was intended to be one.
---
There's actually people insane enough to attempt that event in Survival? It's already bad enough with the Pylon damage, billion Gusty, bomb bots, and an overpowered Assaultron. I can't imagine how worse it can get if you add a griefer targeting everyone actually trying to do the event into the mix.
---
Holy hell that is awesome!
---
Ye Enclave flags
---
This happened to me, completely forgot and immediately got the Event notification... one plyon later and taking the aggro of the Fembot I saw 5-6 people run to my corpse after bleeding out.
---
i wish you could make camp locations public if you wanted, alotta ppl will benefit from showing their store or bar on the map
---
I love games like this.
---
I've been playing DayZ for years, and this is like DayZ but Fallout! I need to buy it soon lol
---
Erm the enclave is far superior.
---
yeahhh.
---
it's not consistent either. during fasnacht i was running out of food bc i was grinding it, so i just decided to eat all of the raw chicken and squirrel bits i had been picking up. i ate dozens in a row without contracting a single disease.
---
flash forward to a few days ago, i eat 2 honey, parasites with the first, dysentery with the second.
---
Sorry, but I have absolutely no idea how to do that nor how to export anything out of the game, including how to export photos or screenshots I take in XB. :(
---
This is the advice you always see in defense of SBs, and I think it sucks. They don't really have "tactics" there are two attacks that repeat with a stupid level of health and DR- making them easy, but annoying and resource intensive.  
---
You have to work your ass off to get to the power level where they're worth killing, and there's just not enough endgame content for that yet. Expecting people to grind the same event over and over just to be able to handle what is supposed to be the apex boss of the game is just bonk man.
---
It's cool and all but you can only build one. I wanted 2 for my front entrance into the castle. How come i can't place more than one? Do they refund atoms?
---
They already have gross, used porta johns in the game, we don’t need to add more.
---
I remember I was in a underground entrance by the path? Or palace whatever that Astral Projection spot is at the top of the map. And the acid line was going all the way through the ground and hitting me directly. So damn annoying.
---
not sure why this would be downvoted, its a great and common sense idea!
---
Another good strategy is to bring along a Cryolator. Once it's vulnerable unload a cryo clip and it'll slow it down massively. As long as it's attempting to melee attack a player it'll keep moving, not using the head laser. Once cryolated it's slow enough that its target can kite it staying out of reach. At that point the fight is over, everyone else and DPS freely. Our crew have used this to great effect. Most kills in under a minute.
---
I hope to God it will be
---
Yeah this is bullshit the least they could've done is let us know there would be no npc's before we bought the game.
---
WTF how dare they force us to listen to holotapes while we play/complete quest objectives to get back story instead of standing infront of a npc reading/listening to dialog.
---
&gt;like damn Bethesda! NPC COULD TURN THIS GAME INTO COLD MINE!
---
Damn right we need a COLD MINE right now❄🌬
---
Who's with me grab your Flaming Pitchforks let's burn down thier HQ I want my COLD MINE right now dammit. 
---
Frfr 💯💯
---
IIRC, the circumstance was that if I manually reloaded, I'd get all 5.  If I depleted it and it automatically reloaded, it would give me 2 and just stop reloading.
---
Right hopefully that comes soon as it would be a life saver :) thanks for the reply
---
Often a shit legendary. Personally I've only got 1\* junk from it.
---
You can scroll through pictures of any item in the atom shop to see it in game.
---
Ive proudly gotten 3 people to buy thia game from my repeated stories about it lol Got a group of 5 friends now to play with!
---
you can get the nukashine quest from the train station , a full guide can be found here. 
---
it is listed as a misc quest, so it may just not be selected as active if you have previously started it. 
---
heres the guide.   [https://guides4gamers.com/fallout-76/quest/wasted-on-nukashine/](https://guides4gamers.com/fallout-76/quest/wasted-on-nukashine/)
---
It’s hard out in the wastes...
---
Like tag the quest in my pip boy, if so then yes. Should I be doing something else too?
---
It's in my back room I have a locked door with some work benches where I make the alcohol and stuff I occasionally let people in to clean there rads and craft
---
They must be 1-3 star legendary enemies.  No star won’t count.
---
This please. There are so many cool underarmors i'd love to wear as cloths but never get to see.
---
Same problem here. Did it twice, no good.
---
Will definitely do this as soon as I get back in to the game.
---
Have to scour the map for correct areas and then go camp there.
---
That would screw up the whole mechanic, though. Anyone contesting a workshop would be sniped by someone just outside the circle, and hence invincible. 
---
I think a better method would be to have a pop up when someone contests your workshop. You can either challenge them, in which case it’s game on pvp where ever you are, or you can decline, no pvp and they automatically get the workshop. That would prevent griefing, and give people the ability to abandon workshops without leaving the server.
---
(Ps4) that not been my experience since patch 8.  Someone nuked it that night - I was late to the party - (over encumbered and walked in from the ash heap) -  collecting flux across the course, met at least one legendary - that one dropped a 2\* anti-armor grognak.  
---
At the golf club - the entire bloated population of the golf club (including the wendigo) met me at the door, at least 4 legendaries.  
---
all respawned immediately when another player appeared.
---
Down cottage row, everything had been killed, but respawned as soon as I hit the first set of steps. got down to presidential cottage, killing at least 4 more legendaries along the way... turned around and headed back towards the resort - all the cottage critters had respawned.
---
Most of them were dropping weapons, not armor...
---
wanted to go for a second run, but real life called, and I had to log out.
---
Last night none nuke, same behavior at the golf club - everything met me at the door and 4x legendaries.  And again in that building behind the resort... 
---
As a bonus, a L91 deathclaw that dropped a legendary weapon.
---
&gt; In summary, IMO, it's a game for nerds.
---
Best description of this game I've heard. It's for you nerds
---
Yeah people can be cognitively lazy and simply refuse to accept that either things change or they might have been wrong. It's a human trait so can't blame 'em but welcome to the fold!
---
You will be disappointed when reaching end game content, because there is none.
---
The rumor is it's linked to player vending, which isn't coming until early May.  But who knows?
---
Move camp. About 2 inches will do it, that will reduce your repair bill.
---
Hi Gary! Its Gary.
---
i doubt it, but if they can do it successfully in Elder Scrolls Online, they can do it here. and theres more players there than in F076
---
Did a post on Monday about it got only 4 upvotes , I’m not roasting the game I was actually pointing out a possible duping method but who cares right ?
---
If you're inclined to just ignore Scorchbeasts because they don't seem worthwhile (which is understandable), I changed my tune when I was doing the event Line in the Sand at Fort Defiance. I actually failed it, but continued with killing the SB that was there. I'm glad I did because I looted a Handmade Rifle Prime Receiver plan off of it. Assuming it doesn't have a special loot table just because of the event, it seems like they might actually be potentially more valuable that I realized.
---
Wasn't there a Boxing/mma match this weekend in one of the servers? This would be a cool arena to watch it in.
---
I also play at night and all of my friends that use to play have since moved on. Mind if I add you too? My PSN is GRIZZLY_CLE
---
This will be super good I have tried to defend a few times but because of the slap system and them not fully breaking things they just turn around and one hit me  since I'm just in suspenders and a hat

Interestingly (maybe only to me), people from Wisconsin and parts of Massachusetts also call them bubblers.

---
The poster? Or the Fermenter? I see the fermenter in my camp inventory but it says I need the plans for it.
---
That explains why one didnt work but not the other. Thanks for the help tho
---
Yeah, I didn't have one. I had to go to a vendor and get it, then craft the item at a tinker bench. Haven't done the battle yet as there was no one else ready to do it when I was on last night.
---
Go for it!! Like I said I’m only 34 and my friend is 140. But making friends is sweet!
---
I like this theory
---
I got lucky and fount it in a paper bad in WhiteSpring lower level during a nuke zone.
---
Done a few emergency exit keep an eye on the map, they usually come over once I have a group of people that's when I just bounce
---
🤣🤣🤣
---
Agreed. I had such a hard time hearing all of the "Sheepsquatch" holotapes. And they were actually enjoyable and worth the listen!
---
I tried but nothing
---
I would care to join, I'm changing my psn today. What's yours and I'll add you with a note describing who I am
---
I just found a way if I store things and replace them I don't have to pay the repair
---
Having a flag or that fold-out sign would be a great addition for player vending.
---
That's alright I'm only level 72 and have been playing since launch lol
---
I believe it was raiders having fun
---
And you can keep earning atom points on a daily basis for FREE!!! Do you think you should have enough atom points to buy all things in the shop? Half the items in the shop? Or a few? It’s made to incentivize BUYING atom cause you know that’s how they make money.
---
Not even raiders destroy the hand that feeds ;) why would you destroy a constant supply of alcohol for free
---
Camera got delayed ... not like it matter but hey push push push keep pushing stuff back
---
Doesn't happen alot, but sometimes the red fireplace will spawn on my roof or second story.

the main thing im wanting is the update for making our houses un-destroyable in adventure mode...

they announced it at the same time as removal of slap damage, but they never actually added into the patch....

It's one of the rewards for completing that event.

Seems like only his fanboys care

I was curious, so U looked up and watched the vid. Meh. Really came across to me as someone jealous of him and looking to take him down a peg. At the end of the day ‘religious guy has opinions/beliefs that fall in line with his religion’ isn’t earth shattering news to me.

Gary???

Gaaaaary !

Hopefully will come soon
---
So I don't have to see everything in fucking green when the flashlight is on. I always changed my pip boy color to white in Fallout 4 just so I could have a regular light.
---
I did 500 atoms worth of free challenges yesterday off to do my last 90 to get a free skin lol
---
yeah they again made things worse with a patch
---
i so want to love this game, and have spent so much time on it, but it just keeps getting worse
---
i cant even run from whitesprings to the whitesprings train station without having the whole trains station be invisible and nothing int he parking lot for like a minute or two.,... i just have to stand there and wait for everything to load in
---
There's was also /u/SirMelling fight night going on.
---
I had the same experience . It's a great game, my favourite
---
I think it's more of an assumption because of the 'Wastelanders' DLC that's coming out later this year. Lots are speculating that it could hint to a vault opening to release NPCs or some NPCs beginning to show up in Appalachia.
---
The radium rifle is pretty useful since it deals rad and ballistic damage. Also a cheap ammo, and it looks cool. I wish there was a "clean" one without all the mods though , we need more WW2/Korean war era weapons
---
It’s like a nuke zone , end game style boss event.
---
So in order to trigger again you have the same perma timer where other player that has not triggered it could do so
---
That would be cool.
---
I tend to break out a 50 cal when I deal with them flying.. I agree they are a pain when flying.. but once they land? Shotgun for sure...
---
I see what you're going for, I was thinking of a build like this for an alt. Your stats really drop off at night with the only exchange being 40 HP. I'd be a little bit worried about being suddenly encumbered as your strength goes from 5 to 2. It's also a lot of wasted points in endurance once the sun goes down. I would say consider these changes to the build:
---
* Drop Endurance to 12 and raise Strength to 4
---
* Remove Nocturnal Fortitude from your default build, only use it at night.
---
* Reduce Bandolier to 1\*
---
* Add Barbarian 3\* (+28 DR during the day)
---
When night time comes you want to completely redo the endurance portion of your build. The stat and ability drop you take is nasty.
---
DAY: Ironclad 5; Photosythetic 2; Sun Kissed 2; Solar Powered 3   
---
NIGHT: Ironclad 5; Nocturnal Fortitude 2; Radicool; Life Giver 3
---
What that will do is make up for the loss in regen, add extra HP, and Radicool will let you increase your DR using rads to buff STR into Barbarian.Once day time comes, swap back and the sun will fix your accumulated rads. It also gives you the option of using rads to increase your carry weight anytime using rads should you need to fast travel.

Well, now I'm not gonna be able to think of it as anything else. It will now and forever be Scorchbeast armpit sweat in my mind now.
---
Trolling isn't a huge deal in this game in general. You can't be damaged by other players in "adventure" mode unless you hold a workshop...or take a workshop from someone. There are those that will try to get you to shoot back and then you can be killed, but just don't let yourself get baited into it! If someone won't leave you alone, just block them and sever hop.  The most common form trolling is some child getting their thrills shooting up your camp...again, the simplest answer is block-n-hop. 😛👍
---
Having said that, I personally have been playing since the beta and I've blocked a grand total of 3 people, 2 at once. 
---
I hope you enjoy the game! Take your time, read the notes and terminals, listen to the holotapes,  soak in the environmental story telling. There is a ton of lore and a pretty deep, emotional, and global story here.
---
Agreed, a definite oasis in a place like Appalachia. Would be dope if you could have bodyguards protect the bar lol
---
I have been getting the itch to purchase this game as well. I see that it is improving and I've been tempted. Hoping to talk another friend into getting it.
---
It just seems so expensive for the PC US digital version still though. Other regions can pick it up for practically nothing. Anyone seen it for around $30 or so?
---
No that's only you. I can mod perfectly fine.
---
Been case on all platforms since day one, but shhh don't say that on here or the down voters will rip you to shreds.
---
Survival mode has been amazing all week long. I was going for the weekly challenge and was so worried I wouldn't be able to because of the other players. Man, I played every night this week to do 20 events (finished it last night), and didn't get killed ONCE by other players. Saw tons of people but we all actually worked together. Lots of thumbs ups and heart hands. It's been nice.
---
Your just wrong imo I guess we see different things I don’t see any one at all saying there there the greatest company ever at all nothing even close you also know that criticism is not just pointing out what is wrong right? Criticism goes both ways saying “oh decent update Bethesda keep it up” is not sucking there dicks if anything it’s encouragement to keep pushing them in the right direction call there shit out but also call out the good that’s how criticism works
---
It’s maxed level I did the medical malpractice with a level 30 and it was level 45 weapon when I got it
---
Reward is at a set level. At least it was for the last one.
---
Ridiculous one , just like leveling up 3 times , or killing this under this circumstance ( where the situation never happens )
---
Lots of glitched out challenges and kinda unfair for the playerbase that plays and try to achieve the true grind
---
Yeah lol exactly
---
Are they loose mods you picked up in world or bought from a vendor? If so these mods are currently bugged across the board.
---
That’s just perfect in every way
---
Duping? Elaborate?
---
I know what you're saying but it is better now than when It came out. Theres more content, the game runs a lot better (still not amazing however) and problem quests now function properly. None of that takes away from the fact that I've had more fun in this game than the majority of other games I've played though
---
It took until now to get it, a feature that's been around since Oblivion and was somehow left out of this game, lol.
---
I don't think Bethesda's engine can handle negative numbers. I don't think I've ever seen them.
---
that is good for you, but its not only me, my regular 6-7 teammates last night also couldnt mod guns or PA
---
Ultra Cute Power Armor?
---
Must be Rainbow Brite themed.
---
But explosions!
---
yeah it kills me to delete any pics as they are all great memories of adventures past
---
Between 1.25 and 2k ea on the market (Xbox)
---
I really like your idea of a help beacon.
---
Yeah thats what I bought it at my local resell store like Disc Replay. Dont know if they are outside my region
---
We're actively investigating this one and currently working toward a fix for the next update. Thanks for your reports!
---
Xbox. PirateNation52. I’m level 52 if you’re keen.
---
2.5k probly maybe some bad ones for 1.5k and the good ones for 3.5k.
---
Xbox one
---
Oh it did. Huh I didn’t hear about it. Well since it’s being pushed back I hope we can take those photos and frame them. Or maybe they are just doing bug fixes
---
Yeh just getting annoyed now because normally I get all daily challenges done, and every day since the patch I've now missed 1-2.
---
I'm super looking forward to player a vending

Fair enough. I only like head gear that covers the whole head. Looks way better.

---
Sexy 😘
---
You are stunning and brave, like a butterfly going against the wind.
---
Id be fine with excluding the 1 stars and making 2 stars the common.
---
People are fine with workshops being pvp. Thats not peoples problem. The problem is that soneone can stand in a bush on the edge of your workshop, line up a shot, then simply initiate pvp and kill you instantly without any chance of ever knowing they were there. I still dont particularly find it griefing unless your picking on low level players just to ruin their fun. But i do think itd be more fun for everybody if it worked differently
---
My own personal experience with it is very buggy(XB1) and slow(my internet), all in all its fun.
---
No one wants to run around the mistake by the lake. 
---
Columbus / Dublin / Reynoldsburg would be fun. I'd love to run around the ruins of the Limited, Bath and Body, Victoria Secrets Distribution Centers, OSU Campus, Nationwide, German Village, Short North.
---
rip
---
or it would be nice to just be able to listen to them and not forced to just stand there reading it very slowly
---
3 radstoms 400 plus hours
---
I would call it an "unfinished" game.
---
&gt;both are real people.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Died 1818/19 and buried @ the old north Church in Boston.  
---
&gt;Reference to FO 4, methinks.  Possible OP thinks (or knows) there might be a hidden/loot chamber behind the marker, similar to  some of the ONC burial vaults in FO4?
---
I feel the odds with the new challenges is = to the nonexistant jester, sun, winter mask from faschet event.
---
yeah its bad again, really getting frustrated with this game, i defend it so much, but its like Bethesda just WANTS it to fail by not having rock solid working servers
---
its an online game! basic functionality is for it to be able to be played online!
---
sorry, im salty as hell from all the disconnects last night, always at a crucial time, just saw a 3 star enemy??? GAME CRASH
---
about to kill the scorchbeast queen?  SERVER DISCONNECT
---
about to finally beat the sheepsquatch? GAME FREEZE
---
Except the game and all PR surrounding the game has been a shit show since launch?
---
Yeah I have a feeling it was about the game the whole time
---
Its actually based on the german WW2 Gustloff Volkssturmgewehr. (Cheaper version of the STG-44 on wich the AK-47 Is based on)
---
the double better part is people saying you can't do it or they'll charge to do it like just add the lines in fallout76custom.ini lmao
---
&gt;fuck their queen.
---
I'm sure she's *scorching* hot.
---
I'll see myself out..
---
Around 2k on PC
---
So, it's a bloodied/unyielding counter more or less?
---
im on PS4 and its been bad recently for me and my teammates as well
---
Yup, keep an eye out for containers you're allowed to do it with, too. They're not always ones you'd expect. It works on all medical kits, chem boxes, pharmaceutical kits... but also the Doctor's Bag containers found here and there, the U.S. Government Supply Drops, and the occasional little blue cooler designated as a "Chem Cooler" instead of just a food cooler.
---
Yeeep this and the new plasma gatling bugs id like to be fixed. Its almost like they literally dont want us to use heavy energy weapons. They prob wont do a hotfix most likely. I was hoping for one yesterday but i guess nothing has generated enough attention from them to do anything about it. Honestly we will prob have to wait till tuesday for anything to happen.
---
I created new muscle memory for the new mechanics , sucks that it takes an extra step to fix weapons , I’m believing this was to benefit their so called repair kits , by adding an extra 2 seconds per weapon , it would be easier now to just use the weapon potion
---
So seems to be about 2k on all platforms.  Thanks!
---
When you interact with it, it explodes and plays a sound!
---
I'm gonna come back to it in late 2020 when it's playable, last I played it was on launch day. Will probably do a comparison
---
Hi! We're investigating this issue and currently working toward a fix in our next update.
---
Not sure if it’s just timing or what but when I logged into survival mode last night there were only 4-5 people in there.  This morning I was one of 3 people in there.
---
Or, it could be made better. I like that solution. Apathy solves nothing.
---
Still working through New Vegas, but I desperately need to know where this toaster is. XD
---
You need makeshift warrior perks to mod melee stuff.
---
It’s a great way to farm shotgun shells.
---
GaaaAAAryyyy.
---
Yup. And Bolstering. Anything that has them using low hp with rads.
---
Apparently it could be abused by pc players (putting any photo in) and seems to be the general consensus in the sub that we won’t :(
---
Look at you power leveling lol. Also been playing since launch and lvl 53... but kids, job, life, etc. Still love my hour here and and there roaming the country roads.
---
Well, the question still stands. Would you mind to make me one in the mean time?
---
Yep, can’t mod PA anymore. It makes the sound of modding but nothing happens. Tried several mods. Definitely a big bug!
---
Xbox ps or pc?
---
well the enclave was fucked six ways from sunday before the institute was even discovered. just sayin' xD
---
There’s currently a bug affecting all weapons and armour in regards to modding. Any new mods are immediately redacted, spending the resources but not applying the requested mod but fortunately so not deleting the currently equipped (post bug) mod as far as experienced
---
More faction based junk over all. Raider stuff like barbed wire chain like stuff rusty trash. I'd lIkE tO rOlE pLaY a rAiDeR please.
---
I'm glad you're enjoying it. I've been eyeballing it for ages. Still waiting to see how the repair kits things go down, plus seeing if I can get it for less than £17 plus it's double xp for honor, anno 1800 beta and events in ESO so I literally have no time to play anything new... Yet
---
It's a current bug affecting all pre-made mods across all platforms.
---
Cool cool.
---
i love this! makes me sad for no charisma speech skill checks
---
To each their own, but I agree- I've really liked the game since launch.. it's just become less and less frustrating to play.
---
I've gotten one too, a 3* and a 1* all in the same day. Don't remember what the effects were though.
---
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
---
Or sell them
---
There is indeed an increased damage scaling in survival.
---
Followed by endless waves of cave crickets.
---
Did they fix that big that meant with the quick version when you pick up a holotape it would play static instead of the recording?
---
I honestly see a lot of rp potential in this game once mods and player owned servers become available.
---
Much thanks!
---
Not just duplicate, but also unwanted cards. I may change the ratio you use though...maybe something like 3 cards rerolled for one new one, 5 cards for 2, 8 cards for 3 (stagger it like shopping deals, the more you spend, the better the deal). 
---
Tie it up as well so that you can either assign a perk point/unlock a card OR you can reroll your cards. If not this, then maybe something like 100 caps every time you reroll, or you can buy something from the atom store for cheap (100 atoms) and craft the item at a workbench, or make it a camp decoration.
---
I'd love to see them try and so a level trade system as well. If you're rerolling cards that are unlocked at level 36, you should get level 36 cards.
---
This is a good theory. I also had one that I recently posted if u wanna check it out.
---
But there was a piece of paper in the basment of the taxidermy building. It was an interview with a doctor(I forgot the name) and another person. The doctor was mainly talking about cryptids being able to reproduce and talked about the mating rituals. It’s actually a really interesting note
---
I'll let a guy dream.
---
Yes! That would make it so much better
---
Pretty sure I found mine in the market area at top of the world
---
Bat urine.  I’m pretty sure it’s urine.  Highly irradiated, ultracite infused, Bat urine.  It’s no secret that bat guano is acidic...why not their pee too?
---
Sometimes the quest disappear from the pipboy. After a relog they reappear. Have you tried that?
---
An option where we could turn on/off all notifications of events popping up around the map would be nice.  That would help alleviate some of the frustration of joining an event and finding out that it ended just before you got there.
---
Right on. I like to play the game as a chaotic neutral, I like to blow stuff up and stab dead bodies but I ain’t tryin’ to kill ya if you don’t wanna die. I’d also like to take this time to give a shout out to Red Eye! You know that love song was about him.
---
Fisto the sex robot, the fake Preston garvey, and the robot that makes beer and tells jokes from fo4
---
Okay true... But this is not an event you can solo... So split the caps with your buddies and the flux and that's not really that bad.
---
Lol yes I literally play every afternoon after work. It’s just the best way to get away from things IMO. I’m proud of you for keeping time to yourself when you can!!
---
I did see that, I'm just not sure how we can try to replicate any "mating rituals," short of running around killing things haha
---
Adventure is just fine the way it is imo.  Each player has complete control over their PVP  options and everyone knows the score with Workshops and what can happen whether they are contesting or operating.  I think base griefing has dropped dramatically overall and am still hopeful Beth will implement do damage to them soon.  If  players chase after wanted reward caps, then I think that's on them to assess cost/loss and do what they want.  Everyone except the newest noob knows whats going on there.  I have had 3 players in the past week reply to me when I texted and asked why they had a bounty on them and got an honest answer from each.  Two (level 7 and 10) asked me to come and take it off them and I did.  I also returned their caps by dropping gear and aid far exceeding the cap bounty reward and everyone was all friends. The third said he had been breaking into bases on another server and said he would bounce off as he was trying to build up the bounty, but was happy to do it elsewhere. We were both friendly in our exchange. Fair enough.  Bye.  So detract or debate as you will.  I think Adventure is fairly well balanced and just what most were asking for in the overall.
---
Can you help me, what's the easiest way (events) to get this gun? I've got some catching up to  do! thanks man!
---
I could still write an essay about all the other problems with the game, though.
---
Lol it’s okay. Life gets in the way! I just try not to have one outside of work cause it’s more than enough.
---
With camps being invulnerable soon from players soon, do you suppose monsters will still be able to break stuff?
---
If so that will be the next form of griefing. Just round up monsters and lead them to someone's camp
---
Would also be cool if everyone uses non legendary Equipment for longer and better fights.
---
Melee damage bug is back also
---
Lmafo
---
Look in the lockers in the prison as you walk straight ahead through the front door. They spawn there frequently. Don’t take anything if it’s not what you want. Servers hop and it will show up after a few. There is radstag, drifter, explorer, ratty skirt that also spawn there.
---
And flag poles!
---
Xbox here! Add me! I usually play solo but I’m down to play with some people every now and then. 
---

I have come to the conclusion that a large section of gamers are drawn to believe they are these uniquely intellectual people who are "better than the sheep". They are geek hipsters who want to believe that they are better than the unwashed masses who are all suckers. They believe they are better programmers than the people making games, better designers, and what THEY want out of a game is what everyone should want. They tend to be omegas in the real world and can pretend to be alphas on gaming message boards.
---
You can see it in the overly dramatic hyperbole filled posts they make. Words like "catastrophic" "outrage" "epic failure" are used as much possible because they have to make sure that everyone sees how dead serious they are and you should listen because THEY KNOW!
---
Play the game if you like it and enjoy it. Don't play it if you don't like it. I have enjoyed 76, but it has its flaws. Honestly, having been playing video games since the 70's, I don't ever remember a perfect game. Some are worse than others, but 76 isn't remotely as bad as people have made it out to be. Fallout is a name that comes with a rabid fan base. Fallout 1 and 2 are two of my three favorite games ever, but even those games had bugs and weren't perfect. Bethesda was taking a huge risk taking on the franchise and the haters have been around since day one. I think they have done a decent job of keeping the franchise alive. It's the gamers that I feel are the ones trying to kill it. 
---
Enjoy the game, it's not remotely as bad as the crybaby internet heroes would make you believe. It's pretty fun and I'm excited to see how it grows from here.
---
So if I hit level 5 and I get a perk card I had already chosen at lvl 4...I play the gsme to much?
---
Makes sense; the whole game is about picking up where others left off!
---
Etsy has a surprising amount of handmade ones? I purchased one to sit on my power armor helmet and I love him!
---
Either we get another part to this unsolved quest, or we get more information in the upcoming burrows.
---
Ideally I would have made this choice right here, but I couldn’t have killed Mags and Dixie. Besides, Operators could be used for professional jobs and the Disciples for well...ya know.
---
And for the monotonous, tense, resource robbing fight that ensues, you get next to nothing to show for it. Its more sensible to just die. You'll lose less
---
this time i will be ready and i will slay it
---
So far, I've only really needed friends/help for SBQ, Sheepsquatch, and some of the more inconvenient events.
---
I also facetank a lot of big mobs. It requires a lot of stims
---
Sounds like a great RP opportunity for a Raider. “Keep the booze coming and we keep the (other) riff raff out.” Not my thing but sounds fun.
---
It does ! And the explosion is all purple lol, guess I’ll have to clean moda better
---
Either we get another part to this unsolved quest, or we get more information on it in the upcoming burrows
---
One time we did well, but failed.  The other... There were two or 3 griefers that kept going to events and just murdering everyone and they where untouchable!
---
What I mean is that, even though there is more content, the vast majority of the actual gameplay is unchanged.  Its not like NMS where large swaths of gameplay were changed before it was considered good.  I agree that it was buggy and that was annoying, but I remember people saying that the game was shit under the bugs which I wholeheartedly disagree with.
---
Zenimax is Bethesda, they created it so they could bring other corporation under its umbrella. I believe ESO was headed by another development company entirely.
---
I was on the fence, but explosions win.
---
I still miss the bog standard Raiders, though. Scorched just aren't the same.
---
https://m.imgur.com/a/KH4Unkg?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app
---
But PIIIINK !
---
Its not balanced if I can have level 60 character that vastly outmatches level 600 one and I get 1/10 of the punishment, so the caps rewards should be capped nevertheless. But also if the rewards for killing players are higher on survival than adventure, even if adventure values would be ok, the issue would still exist as griefing would be encouraged on adventure.
---
I'm running a natural character so I haven't even used chems yet.
---
You can do it with one level. Just complete 3 objectives on the challenge when you level up. E.g. I completed level after 76+, while intoxicated, with sunglasses.
---
*looks at "Brotherhood" flair*
---
You are damn right brother....

I finally found the x01 jetpack after searching for months. Then I realized that i needed violet flux. So after server hopping for a while looking for a nuked server, i decided to launch a nuke, trying it alone for the first time. It took forever but i managed to drop a nuke and get all the violet flux i needed. At this point I've been playing for like 7 hours, the longest I've played since the week the game came out. I go to install the jetpack, and it makes a sound like it's installing it, but it doesn't. I've tried everything, but i can't install any mod on any of my power armor. Now it's 10am, I've been up all night, I've got no jetpack and I think I'm going to take a long break from this game.
---
Massive patch sizes? For console, sure, but the PC ones haven't been ridiculously huge.
---
It was atrocious last night on Xbox. I haven’t been disconnected this many times or seen so much frame rate drop as there has been since the hot-unfix.
---
I've looked there too a few times to no avail.
---
If you look around, there are a couple of human bodies as well.
---
I sprinted into a zone and happened to see the deathclaw attacking one of the brahmin once. I immediately killed the deathclaw before it could do any damage and the two human merchants and all the brahmin still fell over dead a few seconds later. I was too far away to reach the merchants to try to interact with them. Just not meant to be I guess.
---
It was in the mire at the 4 way intersection near the power plant for the dam. The trick-or-treater often spawns there.
---
Thanks for your reports! We're actively investigating both this and the friends list sorting issue.
---
We're looking into this issue and currently working toward a fix in a future update.
---
Listen to this guy right here. Plus, people hate change. I’m sure you could ask him how many people were pissed off when Fallout 3 came out and it was in first person. That’s a huge change right there for a game series. Almost as big as making it multiplayer.
---
Take out all the junk and break it all down in a work bench.
---
Only keep around 100 of each material (more for rare or commonly used materials) 
---
Don't hold onto stuff you won't use. So that level 20 legendary vampire ripper can be sold.
---
Most of the Misc (not Material) mods for Scout armor haven’t worked since Beta. Ultralight does... that’s about it
---
Among others lol
---
You get used to the thirst/hunger.  I thought I would hate it too, so one of the first things I did was put several points into Endurance for things like Dromedary and Slow Metabolizer.  But it's not really necessary.  Water is pretty much everywhere and once you build a CAMP, you'll have an endless supply of it.  As for food, I got Good Doggy early on in a perk pack and I've basically lived off dog food for most of the 160 levels.
---
Honestly, you are asking for a book. Better off checking the last 3 or so patch notes.
---
thanks for your business! :) have a good day

Doesn’t help that the daily level up is now 3 times instead of 1 for the same atom point value.

Kinda had that for awhile id make him high voltage hefe for him to come and help if too many people came
---
There are different iterations of the Mothman. I've met the Vengeful one mostly-- he attacks me. But I walked right up to WISE Mothman and he just left in a hurry, no attack. I don't know if there are any other types though. Anyhow mostly you are not going to have to worry about him unless you choose to fight him. He's easy to run away from
---
As with most things in life, your mileage may vary! I have been playing since beta and that just wasn't my experience. More disconnects,  true, but hardly "every 5-10 minutes"...at least for me. Looking back, I'd say that the bulk of my disconnects were due to dupers doing their thing, the symptoms were the stutter, stutter...DROP.  once Bethesda dropped the ban hammer on those idiots, things got much better. Well, that and all the patches they've pushed out; they are being very responsive to getting things fixed up. 
---
Griefing has never been an issue for me. I'm on PC and from what I know I think it is/was more common on consoles.  In all the time I've played I've really only had 2 encounters I'd deem as griefers with a grand total of 3 people block. Not exactly horrible 6 months in!
---
Love that!
---
We're currently investigating an issue that prevents found mods from being attached to power armor and weapons. Thanks for your reports!
---
How much total? 
---
And what platform do you play on?
---
Hank Madigan, the fallout 76 character. His story is like what would have happened if the main character in the other Fallouts would have died. Had a lot of quests going, joined a bunch of factions, everyone counting on his actions, the crux of the story depended on him. You even got to see previous quests he had completed before you through holotapes and terminals
---
It's an odd find but a cool one nonetheless

Btw if anyone wants to add me on Xbox my gamertage is OG Mr4w350m3. Kind of a goofy gt I know😅
---
Thanks for the tips. I'm sure it is something that I'll get used to. I've also tended to avoid it anyway I can in other games. I'll definitely look into doing that also. At the moment, most of my inventory space is being taken up by food. I really need to sort it all out.
---
I need to work on my camp more as well. I just plonked it down anywhere and was going to sort it out at another point. When I find somewhere that I actually like and looks like a good place to set up.
---
They fixed that a couple patches ago
---
cap collector, scrounger, butchers bouty, pharma farma and Can Do! are **ALL** like this FYI
---
They've fixed a lot of bugs and added some QOL stuff in. People who say the game is trash were expecting either Fallout 5 or a full MMO experience. It is good for what it is.
---
There are 5 daily events (I think). It should be structured so that each event is a different category. IMO, it seems like daily events are there to give someone a reason to play the game every day, Making 5 events alcohol related is going be tedious, or something like "level up 3 times" is a lot hared to do with every higher level you achieve. Keeping sane(?) events, as well as making them different categories, will give small objective to do, and will actually make the player do something...instead of "drink 25 beer"
---
I also feel like it would be cool if the events adapted to DLC. Such as when player vending becomes a thing, make it a daily event to visit a player vending machine or player camp. It sort of forces people into the new DLC, but not in a way that makes it mandatory.
---
Event 1: Kill x of creature y, clear summersville of super mutants.
---
Event 2: Craft/repair x item or gather x supplies
---
Event 3:  Complete x event or capture x workshop
---
Event 4: Take x picture
---
Event 5: miscellaneous, or dedicated to DLC as mentioned above.
---
Event 6 - level up
---
Event 1 - I'm pretty sure in the past they've had something like "kill 10 scorched" or whatever. 
---
Event 2 - This could account for the crazy alcohol events, or anything like armor or CAMP item. Or, you know, let only Biv give alcohol related quests/events, and let this stick anything non-alcoholic.
---
Event 3 - pretty self explanatory, we've also seen them before.
---
Event 4 - Anything really. Take a picture with a friend, Grahm, Insult bot...take a picture naked, etc. You could also roll this as moscellaneous (event 5) item and get rid of one event.
---
Event 5 - randomly generated. Could be anything from "kill a wanted player" to "kill 10 super mutants while wearing BoS power armor" or it can be a duplicate event from earlier (now theres 2 different types of event 1 events).
---
Event 6 - leveling up is already a daily event.
---
You are 100% correct.  My comment replied to you but it really applies to all of the mods.  I'm sorry that it ended up being directed at you when you are one of the more active mods on here.  Good luck in your studies!
---
So far all we have is America and Swiss Flags. There are Chinese flags in th game why not let us place Chinese flags
---
I've been playing FO since the first game dropped. Raiders are a part of the world. They're the game equivalent of Toecutter's Gang, and Lord Humongous' group of Catamites and Degenerates. Of course a blasted, lawless world would give birth to such individuals.
---
In a multiplayer game, however... Raiders seem to occupy the same role as that one guy in your 2nd Ed. AD&amp;D group that insisted in playing a Chaotic Evil character. A force for chaos, that ended up just making everyone else's game kinda suck. That character was either forced into a more "group dynamic" alignment, making the game suck for THAT player, or was allowed to play as their alignment, leading to the inevitable destruction of the party and campaign.
---
There is no DM in FO76 to set the tone. 
---
For every Chaotic Neutral raider that wants to roleplay in a way that adds to the world, there's the Chaotic Evil asshat that wants to trash CAMPs and harass other players until they quit. The former is fun to encounter, the latter is trash.
---
And that's my $0.02, worth exactly what  you paid me for it.
---
This game is trash you fucking losers get over it and delete this stupid fucking sub, subhuman trash.
---
Get outta here lol
---
I would have taken all the plans and found a lower level player and pay it forward.
---
We need a flag pole
---
I actually see the path to enlightenment every time I play.  I think part of it is that someone has to enter the event area before it can happen.  Although to be fair, I'm also going to assume people already ARE in the area when they server hop.  Who knows.
---
I also hope that they add a LFG for general exploring/questing! I often find myself wandering alone while I’d love to team up. Unfortunately the guys I do meet either don’t have a mic or speakers on and can’t hear me talking or are not interested in teaming up. Would love to meet people to explore together through a LFG!
---
It’s been brutal since the hotfix. Like day 1 disconnects and frame rate stutter. Whatever they tried to fix didn’t work.
---
I was able to craft and mod a Syringer yesterday.  I think I heard someone say this was a problem with vendor-bought mods.  Either way, when they went down for maintenance yesterday, I was convinced they were going to fix this because it was so glaringly obvious.  Apparently not.
---
Same with the dumb new "Inspect/Repair" -&gt; "Workshop Repair" workflow that is not only awkward, but blanks out the menus half the time when you Tab back.
---
I actually second this. That's one of the main reasons I feel like I "need" to play with someone else sometimes, so I don't die running into a really high level enemy. I don't think I'd join a team of strangers for extended play but if someone just wanted help fighting something real quick I would definitely do it.
---
Life is serious enough , your games shouldn’t be. I enjoy the game , yes the game is better with friends but sometimes I like just to build &amp; explore in peace as well . If your looking for a crew (PS4) we have a community called Construction Corp. 76. Causal players &amp; hardcore  we are a mix bag of gamers . We do events &amp; help others with collecting trophies.
---
Oh I should point out for that event, it spawns when some one gets near the area. Almost reliably. It was the first event this week they used that you could reliably find (the pvp one almost never spawns these days which was their first, and I tried to get the even for Wednesday to spawn to no avail, spent quite some time trying different things and servers. 
---
Not that it helps as 1. It’s already the next day as of this post (I just happened to notice that complaint) 2. Don’t feel like you missed out, it seems bugged. It didn’t work for me or my friend (didn’t give us the atoms and the few people who responded to my post about it only one got it to work).
---
The absolute \*best\* way to collect violet flux is to launch two nukes, one at the Whitespring to collect hardened masses, glowing masses, and radiated fluid (or whatever it's called). Don't collect any flux.
---
Then launch a nuke just to the west of right in between Hemlock Holes and Wavy Willard's Water Park. You can collect more than 200 raw violet flux this way, but there's no creatures to collect glowing masses and etc. from, that's why you have to do the Whitespring first. But then you'll have enough violet flux to last you quite a while, if you need it.
---
Welp. . . You just sold me dammit! Lol, I assumed it was tabletop sized like the other ones. Now. . . Where to put in my camp? HmMm. . .
---
Clark!
---
Total RNG.  The first couple times, I think I got 3\* from *both*.  And yesterday, it was 1\* from both.
---
Just a thought, but how many special points did you put in LUCK.
---
My luck is 13, and i find quite a few 2* and 3*.
---
But maybe im just lucky.
---
:)
---
I had the Gorg Junkyard for 2 hours yesterday with no pvp. Thanks to those in the server I got enough black titanium to get my excavator power armor.
---
You can search before you remove any existing items in the container or after.  Xbox makes a ding when extras appear, don't know about other platforms.  This can happen as long as 3-4 seconds after searching the container, so hang around a few seconds after searching if no item (s) initially show.
---
At the Fasnacht parade you could get Swiss Flag polesand garlands
---
And that’s after they reduced the price. They used to ask 1800 for PA skins.
---
 Very fairly put. I hope i run into you in the wastes as "the Canadian raider eh! I'm coming for your timmies bud!"
---
The only problem with this is you know people would make Nazi penis flags
---
Ye, but nothing I have nukeshin note in the inventory but no quest, how can I do?
---
Give us dark room equipment to build at our CAMP. Yessss.
---
Oh yeah gameplay wise its still the same. I completely agree with you about the game tho. I love it, played every minute of the 'beta' and have around 600 hours. Aside from the lanky power armour bug and a few minor ones I never really had an issue with bugs. I just had serious issues with connection. Got really bad around the end of January and I stopped playing for a month but the stability is quite good for me now
---
Made the mistake of taking over a workshop last night. Not seeing a single workshop claimed on the entire map yesterday should have been my first clue something was up and sure enough, in the middle of the 1st defend event, I was one shot killed and so was my teammate. Lost 72 caps, seemed pretty high after reading the changes to survival mode. Ignored the person and kept playing but I doubt I'll be taking over ANY workshops in the near future.
---
Western Revolver beats any other pistol out there hands down for pure damage.
---
Crossbows are fun, but have no mods for them at all. Noone uses them though, so you can probably get your pick easily enough on the trade forums.
---
Lever Action Rifle does more base damage than a hunting rifle, but you can toss on anti-armor magazine to help. To tell the truth, find any legendary Instigating rifle (of any type) and the rest is basically a moot point anyway.
---
Throwing weapons (and crossbow bolts) have a travel path and will often collide with terrain regardless of VATs hit chance.
---
Here’s the issue: Effects like poison or Wendigo scream, or bleed all have chances to inflict disease. The chances are high for getting diseases anyhow, but each point of poison is also a chance, meaning that you typically get a disease the first time you’re hit by a ghoul.
---
It doesn't show you size. Or even give you a close representation of how big those statues are
---
I posted this on someone else's post a couple of months back when we still had 400-600 stash sizes, I still do everything pretty much the same way, so I'll post it here:
---
&gt;Begin Copy/Paste
---
First ff, If you like hoarding legendary items I highly recommend making an alt to transfer to. I have 2 dozen friends I've never talked to (which is  common for me for some reason) just so I can reconnect to a map and  transfer stuff via a 0 capacity cabinet (my only real friend and  favorite NPC in the game). If you have future builds planned, make the  base level 2 characters and move the items over. Be prepared to lose  stuff once in a while with that method as people sometimes ~~quit the game~~  crash or disconnect in the 15-20 seconds it takes to swap characters.  This has the side affect of being able to give those alts stuff to sell once you've capped your primaries daily sales.
---
So  with pretty much no weapons or armor in my stash here's the priorities I use to reduce back to ~~400~~ 600 when I hit ~~600~~ 800. This is mostly in order,  although I never remember to do it all in this order.
---
**Crafting**
---
* Smelt all of your rotten stuff into fertilizer and dump the remainder.
---
* Convert all of your ore using acid.
---
* Cook all meat and produce so you can get rid of non-perishable foods and use up water.
---
* Craft merged drugs (Bufftats, etc), Stimpacks, and other regular drugs.
---
* If you don't care about the things they make scrap all Beer Bottles, Molerat Teeth, Circuit Boards, Assualtron Heads, Bleach Dogwood,  and Deathclaw Hands.
---
* Craft  bullets. You might think you have enough, but if you have guns, you don't. If you don't use lead in repairs, use all your lead this way.
---
* Repair  your own stuff. (This should be done first, probably. I usually forget until now. Good thing I don't use lead in repairs.)
---
* Bulk up Aluminum and Lead. Nothing else drops weight other than the plastic you use for the bulking.
---
* Repair all expensive armor and weapons you intend to vendor.
---
* If there is legendary armor you want to keep, check if you can put Light or Ultra-Light on it for storage.
---
**Shopping**
---
* Sell Non-Perishable food. It just ends up adding up over time, dump it and cook better food for buffs. Canned food is pointless once you learn to farm, it just takes up space and you'll end up overstocked in no-buff food.
---
* Sell Alcohol if you don't intend to use it. It tends to stack up quickly if you loot it every time you see it. Unless you're planning on using it, it should go.
---
* Bulk up and sell most junk so you only have 5-10 of each in bulk. 5 of rarely used and 10 of what you repair with. I'm a non-power armor user so I only keep Adhesive, Acid, Plastic, Wood, and Ballistic Fiber in 10's.
---
* If  you keep having non-bulking junk hit over stacks of 100, sell the individual back down to 50 (Because Vendors will buy most non-bulkable items). It's usually good for 50-70 caps per stack. I constantly sell Yarn, Crystals, Silver, and Circuits; 50 of each cleans out 1 vendor.  Keep all plastic for bulking more items for sale.
---
* **Sell chems** that don't match your build. Melee build? Sell your Calmx. Sniper build? Maybe dump some fury. Keep 5 of each for posterity?
---
* Check your Misc tab for burnt books and such. They sell for 1 cap each and have weight.
---
* If  you are not in the habit of using mines, sell them as well. They're good, but if you never use them they are just dead weight.
---
* ~~Bobby pins. You shouldn't need more than 30-40 on hand. 100 bobby pins are 10 pounds.~~ *Fixed in a patch.*
---
**Dump/Transfer/Use**
---
\*Leave things in cash registers, garbage cans, or suit cases at shop vendors to help out your fellow 76er's.
---
* If  you don't use the weapons dump, Missles, Mini Nukes, .50 Cal Balls,  Cannonballs, Harpoons, Crossbow Bolts, Flares, Railway Spikes, Plasma  Cores, 40mm Grenades, 2mm EC, Gamma Rounds, Cryolator, Flamer Fuel, and  Paddle Ball String. You can find/craft more in the future if you need it, even that smaller size ammo is 1lb per 100.
---
* Any  Fusion Cores under 50%. If you have 3 at 100% that's all you should  need. I can't even give fusion cores away to PA users I meet. I personally only keep 1.
---
* Scrap Steel that you couldn't bulk. If you hit 200 Scarp Steel you're hoarding wrong. If you need more steel and can't find it, you haven't left the vault yet and don't need to be reading this.
---
* Books and Bobble heads you'll never use. (See "Sell chems" above)
---
* Recipes you already know.
---
* Left over Rotten and Spoiled foods.
---
**Other Things**
---
* With junk in your inventory, go to the junk tab in your pip-boy and go to "Component View". Tag what you always need/want and only grab that junk when out (it will have a little magnifying glass). This will reduce the speed at which you fill your stash
---
* Consider using Nuka-Cola's as a replacement for Stimpacks. They weigh the same but build up over time. Save the Stimpacks for when you really need  them.
---
* Connected with the above, consider Traveling Pharmacy. Even 1 level will let you just stack bunches of 1lb chems in your inventory. At level 3 100 Chems  weigh 10 lbs in your inventory. It's the only weight Perk I'd recommend  for the sole purpose of medigating Stash weight *unless* you have Speed Demon and always need food, then Thru-Hiker is also a good use of an Agility point.
---
This was longer than I intended it to be. So I hope it helps some, none, or all who read it.

I will gladly play with you, im from different country ( czech republic ) but i can communicate in english, if you dont mind older guy (30) then hit me up with your username.
---
I love being on top and I don't shoot people on sight if I'm not in active warzone and chances are high they are enemy team.
---
I have zero fun from fighting an unwilling opponent. Were not talking only about griefers, we are talking about big perspective on PvP, I hope.
---
I myself was supporter of previous leaderboards but I don't think its as bad now as I thought it would be. You are usually in the leaderboards when you score three kills, so you can get your tool for luring enemy teams pretty easily.
---
I'm on ps4.  Looking to buy as well.   Feel free tol message me if you're selling.
---
I’m going to add a new comment to point out it really isn’t a good sign when their new mobile game is being panned for being worse on f2p pay mechanics than most f2p games. Bethesda is definitely trying to follow EA :(.  I really didn’t want to believe but from where I see FO76 going (it’s getting very grindy just for atoms and imagine what the game will be like when they add repair kits and can make it grindy just to play the game) and hearing how greedy they are in their mobile game I just can’t deny it.
---
Ass Sent players weren’t unkillable from the beginning. People in here are exaggerating with their complaints about Sent Ass being op. I both kill and I die. That being said, I did not see a decline in dmg resistance and I‘m in full Sent Ass armor since survival is available. I win I‘d say 2/3 of my encounters and I have the feeling the armor gives good protection. I could not notice any changes.

Russian intelligence services hacked the game to prevent people from knowing The Truth that is our lord Mothman.

I have it on PS4, got boned by a bug and missed out on the level 100 trophy, so I’m leveling a new character. Low 20s at the moment,  PSN is the same as my username here. Been a bit busy but if I’m on feel free to hit me up.
---
It is telling that a “I don’t think this game sucks” post is getting so many upvotes and comments lol
---
They fixed a bunch of bugs. It's worth coming back for the new content if you enjoyed it in the past. I stopped at a similar level and have been back a couple times. Also, a dungeon releases tuesday!
---
Early on, when you're exploring the world, it's probably to your benefit to keep your CAMP simple and actually use it as a portable camp to plop down whenever you need to repair, craft, or stash things.
---
One warning is that the more foundation pieces you use in your CAMP, the harder it will be to place down again.  Many starter CAMPs are just a collection of workbenches and no foundation at all.
---
Don’t play Survival play Adventure.
---
I'm looking to buy. I was stupid and bought one from whitesprings for 17k and dont want to do that again lol
---
not connection, more the power of the machine. the ps4 can’t run as well as pc.
---
To someone with a prime shotgun they are. Should be able to get 1 Cap per anyways. If you're on ps4 I'm you're guy.
---
They are adding a fucking dungeon next week, cmon man.
---
Yeah I feel ya man. I've been defending it since launch but every time they fix one bug six others show up. Its getting pretty annoying.
---
Its all about this in every game of this type, its just that Fallout76 is the most extreme one when it comes to ridiculousness of systems complication.
---
It was the same way with the sbq but that boss was easier to carry on.
---
Right I didnt expect this at all. Just figured id tip my opinion of a first impression in here lol.
---
Sadly Im An Xbox Man
---
For not listing PC master race first, I must now down vote you.   J/K !!! 
---
Glad you have skipped the hype and are enjoying it... Take your time and explore it all! There are at least as many unmarked locations as marked ones on the map!
---
This is what type of experience I would like to spare you guys in order to maximise overall amount of worldwide enjoyment.
---
Haha. Yeah I look foward to it
---
Would love to be able to swap (destroy) a perk card for a stat point switch.  Be a nice way to let people tweak characters at lower levels without being punished by getting behind on cards.
---
Well probably not because it would likely have to be a unique item for each one. If course the way to limit that is to limit the number you can have in your camp.
---
However not abusable since it would be limited pictures you take in game.  Sure PCers would hack and use it to put up naughty pictures.
---
In that case just give it to console players. Yeah that’s not fair. But PC people seldom stop and ask themselves should they do something.
---
Platform and approx time?
---
Wait, what are you spending the caps on?
---
Thank you. :-)
---
Did you get looking to the future pose for camera ?
---
Been missing for a while 
---
Explosive vents broken since launch date , lots of stuff with proof and people seem to downvote or don’t care care more about some player sending Todd Howard Bobby pins months ago ( reporting it as current news) etc ... Dunno just gonna sip some coffee for now lol

Same on ps4.

Platform?

I just hate these „To the guy...“ posts...

Today I Learned. I wonder why the name "the gusher" didn't catch on?
---
You ok sheep?
---
I am wondering the same thing.
---
I did path twice last night, once on overdrive, other on psychotats:  no atoms
---
As an FYI there are two nearby spots that can spawn fireflies.  Tad north of the sunny top station is an intersection where critters spawn, can be 4 there, and then following the tracks south you’ll see a shed on your left which can also spawn critters.  Got 7 in no time, but gave up after 3 hops.
---
Would be a nice megathread to make hints on these items.  Toys for instance you can get them all in graftin dam.
---
I dig it
---
It did say life sized xD
---
.... I'm almost level 70 with Pharma Farma maxed out as well and didn't know that's what you had to do...... I'm so ashamed of myself.
---
This is so badass I want to set this as my Xbox background now
---
I disconnected about 30 seconds in, respawned and couldn’t see the sheepsquatch for the majority of the fight (yes I know it’s cloaked, but even when it wasn’t all I could see was the head laser). Thankfully I was able to get a tag in at the bitter end when the remainder of the game loaded in correctly. Last night was the worst the servers have been in months.
---
E)Take
---
Just do a video recording and post it on your wall or upload to youtube next time you run through it so I can check it out. You seem to have a good system going I'm on XB as well.
---
Is it not becuase it is technically "damage per shot" and the 2 shot just fires a completely seperate shot to the first one?
---
Why I think not good sir

Short of it I did something to a power armor frame that ended up making two of the same one on workbench ( one on workbench) one on inventory
---
The correct answer is Three Dog.
---
its a perm event. it doesnt pop up at random. someone has to summon it with a 3 hr cooldown
---
I  played 200+ hours, level 79 but i am nowhere close to launching a nuke. I have not done a main quest in weeks.  I think the average level 20 has done more quests but thank you.  Might come in handy later. :)
---
Oh I know, I just pointed my own luck because it might take the sting out of the op's situation.
---
Maybe there is a beacon we need to find our create that replicates it.
---
It is a bug on PS4 also, it just amazes me how things like this get past testing and into the actual patch that gets released each time
---
In other words: if you're focusing on killing to survive, your defense is a bit weak, and you won't bother about reviving some random, if they go down because they distracted the legendary for you to tag.
---
I loved how I hated the leader of Vault City.
---
I would like to have BOS flags. I like to RP as a BOS member and would love to make a BOS compound.
---
I would do this if I didn't have so much of my stash filled with gear and aid I'm hoping to sell in player vending (or that I could reroll when the legendary vendor arrives). I have no idea if our player vending capacity will be shared with our existing stash capacity or not, but I'd like to think it's more valuable to hold them for people who could use them better than I could.
---
If I feel like I'm gonna get downed, I'll make sure I distance myself from other players and just respawn as quickly as possible. I have yet to lose my junk, but I've got enough stashed away that I won't be totally bothered if I lose what I'm carrying. Still scummy of those players to jack stuff from people basically running the event for you.
---
Not had it in combat, but for like a minute after first logging in or if I fast travel, I get serious lag and rubber banding... you would think after being out nearly half a year and after however many patches that this sort of stuff wouldn't be an issue anymore.... this should've been all sorted after beta. I mean, I thought that was the whole point of releasing a beta?
---
Nice post history
---
I agree and did the same thing. I enjoy the fresh FO experience and look forward to playing more. Grats on the purchase!
---
Last time Indid the event, there was a PA user crouching and hiding behind a small bush, which wasn’t even half as big as he was. He just looked around and did nothing the whole time. But it looked ridiculously funny. That being said, I hate players like that.
---
Yikes
---
I removed the scope on it, i prefer using it in mid range
---
It’s good to hear you’re enjoying the game so far! It’s a nice change of pace to see something positive about this game.
---
i was fine
---
Even if it isn't limited time you need help, so should do within the week or so while other players are flocking to the event to collect all the pieces.
---
You aren't able to fast travel? Granted their aren't any enemies nearby?
---
So much of your own opinion you waited half a year before you bought it... if only everyone was so brazen.... /facepalm
---
I've crashed a few times at this event. Usually just an infinite black loading screen on death.
---
I noticed that also. At one time it was just me and a lvl 249 (i'm 100), but we did 3 events together and left each other alone. The next world I jumped into I was one of 10 but everyone was still generally cool. I had one guy attack me but he was only a 19 and a couple of my turrets killed him before I kew what was going on lol.
---
Bugs and crashes are nothing new with Bethesda games, but they do actually seem inclined to fix them ( though often introducing new problems in the process ) so I wouldn't say that's one of the things killing the IP. Shallow, yes, perhaps, but I haven't run out of things to do yet and the content keeps getting better. I love this game too, it's a blast to play solo or with friends when it works.
---
&gt;I haven't gotten too far yet but so far I thinks its a really good game.
---
That kind of makes your opinion irrelevant. And at the end of the day, it's *your opinion*. Some people love it, some people like it, other people hate it. 
---
Objectively, it's a terribly put together game. Doesn't mean it can't be fun.
---
It just works
---
I finally get my hands on an x01 jetpack mod and I can't install it. PS4 here.
---
Can confirm, griefed a guy on rust about 5 years back with a dick swastika on one of his signs.
---
In my defense, he was acting like a nazi
---
Hey do you still have plans for heavy combat arms at all?
---
To add to overlooked game mechanics... I didn't realize until a month ago that you can open the back of some of the trucks.  The ones where the doors aren't dented (they also tend to have cinder block steps to make it easier to get inside), there's goodies in them.  The vast majority of them are dented/unopenable so I assumed they all were until I found a key at Crevasse Dam for the truck at that location.
---
I'm a person of my own opinion!
---
What platform do you play on? If it's PS4, I'm always happy to help out with some chems, cores, and ammo.
---
I found two (on two separate trips) in the test vault underneath VTU. Same place both times, on a dresser/shelf in a classroom.
---
Brahmin milk was op! /s
---
The first 50 levels are super fun. I’m at the point where I’m running out of resources to build ammo and that is a bit less fun. The Scorch Beast Queen chews up a lot and I’ve only recently started joining in when someone sends a Nuke. 
---
I’ve only ever had one grinder but I don’t mind raiders. Supposedly my turrets will be more effective against them now. 
---
I’m really enjoying the camp building, I’m hoping they continue to improve and make that a more interesting and valuable part of the game.
---
My family comes from Appalachia, I live in the foothills of the Appalachians, it's pronounced App-uh-latch-uh. Bethesda always does a damn good job getting the little details right

&gt;  tarnishing the reputation of your business in a way that you may not ever recover from

Oh, come on. You're being dramatic. That can never happ---

---
Oh. Yeah, they better get their shit together fast.
---
Yep. First thing I thought of when I saw the cap reward decrease.
---
What console you on. Im on Xbox and have 3 fedora's.
---
My moms name must be 'online games'.
---
I play for a mix of the two and I'm guessing most do - if there's a good story and it's not costly I don't care about a reward because the experience along the way is fun. If I dump all my ammo and my armor gets broken with nothing particularly engaging for a story like with the SBQ, then I will definitely care about the drops and XP.
---
The only answer is Three Dog.
---
It just seems to me that you would get the legendary benefits more often if you didn't use the scope. Think i'll try that this weekend. Thanks bud.
---
I've been drinking inert flux with the +disease resist instead of water and I feel it's made a difference.
---
Think it's a two part quest with the scout dlc lol science experiment gimme wrong they mixed a sheep with yau gui
---
Not quick and easy, but if I try to do the challenges they should be a challenge (difficult) but not require mechanics that break the emersion of the game (like spending an hour not playing and just logging in/out to find a server with the right event). 
---
What ends up happening as it's free ATOMs is you spend all your play time logging In and out and then wonder "Why am I playing a game that the challenges are no longer fun?".
---
A lot of the generation is done server side, and pushed down to client gameplay, so I assume it would be pretty hard to make fo76 completely local machine based, and also quite system intensive
---
Dog I'm just sayin, there's only two reasons people go to Fandom subs to say "HEY FELLOW FANS, I TOO AM A FAN OF THIS THING AND THE PEOPLE WHO AREN'T FANS OF THIS THING ARE POOPOO HEADS". Those reasons being validation of an opinion, easy karma, or maybe a little of both.
---
Same. I crashed 3 times on 3 different servers and I got pissed knowing the fact I just used a ton of stimpacks just to crash 3 times. Hopefully they fix the stability in like a hot fix or something, but from now on I literally try my best to not die because I fear of crashing on the loading screen
---
Most of the quests have been fixed.. I,  personally,  am unaware of any that are still unable to complete, but your mileage may vary! Camps also are way more stable. I've not had a single issue there in some time, though admittedly my camp is rather spartan compared to many people's! 
---
Give it another try...I think there is a double XP weekend coming up, start fresh. I'm going to do a new build myself
---
I still go back and chuckle about ole No Bark Noonan from NV. "well says No Bark, we got a chupacabra with an automatic weapon. And that's when they get real quiet, cause now they see the predicament were".
---
Also a fan of the dude outside of the boomers base, "jumping Jesus on a pogo stick".
---
It’s just a map.  And it’s all rendered client side.  Server is just responsible for maintaining the multiplayer aspect and clashes between player clients.  Totally irrelevant to what I asked, NEXT!
---
I almost spit out my coffee reading this lmao
---
Ok I’ll give it a go! But I swear to god if you let me down I’m gonna be so upset
---
No worries, and thanks. I took it fairly personally at first but now know it wasn't meant the way I took it.
---
That was my exact reasoning. 
---
Loading screens are not the game, and some of the daily's just make you lose emersion with the game and you end up playing "Loading Screen Simulator." And not the F2P game on Steam that takes around 10 minutes to complete and has a few decent jokes thrown in.
---
ESO was developed by Zenimax Online Studios.
---
Personally: Fallout 76 should've/still can be a joint project between Bethesda: Austin and Zenimax Online. Zenimax can guild Bethesda: Austin and help optimise the game/make it wayyy more stable for the community.
---
I mean eventually they'll have to up the player count, 24 is to damn small for a modern game. Most games nowadays are at 32/80 players per server.
---
Lol I did the same thing. and feel the same way
---
Same i went from acrew leader to being on council of helpful players that want to help everyone
---
My camp is in the Ash Heap in the bottom left corner of the map right past Welch. The majority of my event completions came from taking work shops and then defending them. Also Load Bearing and Breach and Clear are both fairly easy events as well. i did my last 10 events last night and they were all the events I mentioned above. Took me about 3 hours. I did the other 10 throughout the week just jumping from event to event as soon as they were over and that took about 6-7 hours. Unfortunately I did 5 events over the course of this week that didn't log properly.
---
I’m just glad someone else has done it! I was server hopping so I was rushing through the post trying to find the event. I got lucky and joined in 3 events with 3 successes. I need the imposter head and the mascot head but I’m not paying 2k for it since it’s not a limited event! It was weird because the first event I did, probably at noon of the first day, there were 3 different 3 star enemies including the sheep squatch. I think I’m going to buy the damn card! Lol
---
Pointing out that you were hiding in a cave blocked by foundations and someone managed to still kill you, doesn’t make me look like an ass, in fact quite the opposite, it makes you look like a salty exploiter. Go cry somewhere else where people care.
---
I’m on PS4 and the game has been unplayable due to stuttering/hitching every 30-60 seconds. I tried re downloading it, rebuilding the database, and tried deleting my local save data. Nothing helps. It’s the servers and they are garbage right now.
---
Oh.  Well.  I bought one haven't built it yet, but that's awesome.
---
This may be one of the best ideas I have heard yet for this quest. 
---
thank you
---
The toaster is found in the Old World Blues dlc
---
Yes the exact same thing happened to me as well. I got stuck a few times and the messenger as well
---
Short answer? Not difficult, just time consuming. And you would need a rather large team to do it. Someone might get the balls to do it, and put together a team to get it done, but I wouldn't expect to see it for months.
---
I believe the perk for Fusion core usage is called Power User. I'm running it at level 2 with Power Patcher (power armor condition decreases slower) level 3, though those could easily be swapped around for personal preference.
---
I've been playing since launch and I have loved the game since day 1. I suppose I got lucky because I never suffered any of the early bugs, so I was never put off by any of it.
---
I will say now survival has been brought in the Adventure side has become so much more tranquil and I really don't mind the empty spaces and desolate lands.
---
I'm at lvl180 and going through a slow, painful re-spec/tweak. I usually play on my own but lately have really enjoyed the company of other players. If anyone wants to walk the wastelands with me that would be cool. My PSN is reddevilbriggsy...I think. Will edit when I get home if I'm wrong though. (I don't do PVP)
---
Never have i ever seen such a post where OP says that the hate is justified. Everyone who bought FO76 late bc of the hate liked the game.
---
That shows that the whole hate around Fo76 is BS.
---
Why are you asking questions if you already know everything?
---
Right on I see where your point is I just dropped my opinion by bc I knew this game was getting alot of hate. Didnt expect it to take off like this though lol
---
This is all 3 sizes at coldstone rolled into one video - like it, love it, and gotta have it!
---
Pay no attention to this man comrade, he will be in lavianka soon answering for his solicitous crimes and false statements mother Russia hides nothing from its people! There is definitely NO conspiracy going on here.
---
My mind is blown
---
Personally I feel they are testing what the challenges should be, and to many free ATOMs? It's 50/60 a day, plus made 200 from the weekly and that adds up to 500-800 ATOMs a week. 
---
Weekly bundles have been 1000-1500 ATOMs and each week for the last two weeks there has been two on same and other items. 
---
Challenges in a game should not be "Log in and out loads of times in one location trying to find this set event/monster." Challenges should be a challenge but not break the emersion if the game.
---
It's coming from the same series of laws, they're just so poorly written that they can be construed to cover virtual currencies as a "crypto." Probably because the values can change.
---
I play on xbox, mostly solo cause I have no irl friends who own or like it, but I picked xbox because it was reminiscent of how I played fallout 3, new Vegas and 4 on. I'll probably swap over to PC when its released on steam though, for reasons...
---
Liberty Prime is the true American answer.
---
fallout 76 doesnt support mods
---
An option to be notified for whichever event that you choose would be pretty cool
---
You should get a job working for a company like Bethesda. Show them how it's done. Be the change you want to see.
---
Or... bitch and tell others how to do their job. That works, too, I guess.
---
I agree about story coming first but the drops are awful and the amount of resources needed to do it over again is proof that it's barely worth the time and effort when in reality you should be decently rewarded for any big missions. You are playing their game after all why make it such a grind and force even more players away
---
Because I know one thing, suddenly I know everything?  I just want to start up the conversation so we can see it happen.  But please, downvote away to make sure it never gets out!
---
I’m on Xbox too.
---
I got you, looking for good LVL 50 armor or a good Shotgun/Gatling Gun.
---
Happens to me all the time. I'm on Xbox.
---
Personal recomendations:
---
1. Do the main quest in order, even if you take a break to go exploring. So many people just go straight for the enclave at the end cuz they wanna launch a nuke, but then you miss out on so many interesting things.
---
2. Explore. There are plenty of notes and holotapes with great lore to it, and many places are either unmakred or have no quests related to it.
---
3. Play Adventure mode until you find your footing. Survival is mainly for non-stop PVP and from what i've seen the players there arent forgiving for lower levels.
---
3. Dont hoard. You have a stash limit. Take care in what scrap you want to keep and what you don't need.
---
As for a platform, if non of your friends play, then its really up to you.
---
PLEASE
---
They should remove caps from PvP in adventure mode - contest a workshop, kill someone, at most you'll get the workshop and junk.  And fix the contesting workshop exploit...  make PvP only in the workshop zone, leave it and you can't PvP anymore.
---
I’ve seen disc copies for like 25GBP in my local appliance store
---
Wonderful, I haven't started Old World Blues yet. Thanks for the heads-up!
---
"Gave up after three hops." 
---
That was my point, you shouldn't have to server hop to complete challenges.
---
I'll be on tonight if you want one. GT is same as my screen name.
---
This sub is extremely bipolar lol, sometimes posts like this get absolutely dunked on and sometimes they get a lot of praise. People here love the game one second and hate it the next, that's why I suspected you might just be playing the karma lottery, but I can tell that wasn't your intention now. I apologize for being a cynical asshat.
---
You'll love it.  My favorite dlc of any fallout game.
---
Now that they are considered rifles they are no longer limited to only 50% limb damage so they can get any legeo effect.
---
Everyone wants explosive and VATS criticals now, as expected, but the true gems may be the 50% limb damage. I brought a furious 50% limb damage to fight the SBQ the other night and as a rifle build with 15 perception and targeting her wing she was on the ground within seconds after she went into the air every time.
---
I’d have hoped someone else would have started this conversation a long time ago, but thank you for the unassuming answer
---
Mods for 76 may not be out yet, but the modding community could probably get this going for every other fallout game
---
Lol. Feel free to hunt me down, if love to hear your opinion after a second look! If you're on PC, feel free to give me a ping, I can make you some basic equipment to help you along...or just roam around. 👍
---
IGN=THE_ZIMMERS
---
They only appear when a nuke is launched
---
there is no pay to win.
---
That has to be the funniest FO76 lore I've heard, comrade.
---
Its all good man everyone has their right to opinion. No hate
---
Sentinel armor does not effect your status on the map in any way. It isn't more special than other legendary armor. In order to not take damage with it, like you see some people doing, you require armor with both Assassin and Sentinel prefixes.
---
On top of that you need dodgy (agi) and serendipity (lck) as well as having any number of other defensive measures (dense mod on chest and Fireproof (end) for explosion resistance.)
---
With all of these things, only radiation, stagger (which you can counter by jumping) and critical headshots via VATS can touch you. You need to watch your AP though. 
---
Source: I run this exact setup with a bloodied explosive Gauss rifle on a critical sniper build. I would dare say it's a damn fine build.
---
Generally, armor piercing is the best type of effect on a reciever, or damage buffing.
---
How do people not understand...  The game isn’t rendered on a distant PC and streamed to your screen.  The reason your computer has to be of certain specs is because it’s rendering what’s on screen.  I didn’t know this part of video game rendering was such rocket science to you people
---
Sorry, that was the impression I got from [this](https://www.engadget.com/2019/04/09/fallout-76-horse-armor/) article titled "'Fallout 76' update adds contentious 'pay-to-win' item". If that's not actually the case then my bad for not doing more research.
---
I'd love the thirst blaster as well.
---
I bought it back when they put it nearly half price in the Microsoft store for xbox1. I still have not played it yet myself. Originally had waited in hopes of them ironing out some the problems. Now I'm jus worried to start it and unlike the inhabitants of many/majority of the vaults, I have a choice
---
Sounds good I'll message you
---
The lack of NPCs wish is also something that comes from the youtubers-trasher-who-never-played-the-game,
---
When you play, you find that logical, and you start to see npc "behind the line"
---
Believe there's a maximum you can increase speed.  If you already have speed demon you might be tapped out.
---
That hurts!  I haven’t counted how many I’ve gotten, but what I have (which would be few) none I’ve kept because they were no good.
---
Bethesda doesn't want us completing these. They want us to buy atoms. The current challenge system is a purposely broke sham of a system.
---
Hmm, I think this would work fine.
---
I was being followed by something one night as I was tracking North along the edge of the cliff face by the monorail elevator. I was sprinting and figured whatever it was would fall behind but it didn't and that made me think it was probably a radscorpion (my kryptonite, I hate those things). So with a reluctant sigh I turned around to face my foe and all I see in the darkness is a hulking shape with two red eyes starting at me for just a beat before launching straight up and I completely lost where it had gone. Then, suddenly, it's RIGHT BEHIND me and we end up duking it out just a couple feet from the edge.
---
When I finally whittled it down, and my last shotgun blast dropped it and it slumped and fell off the edge. I had to traverse my happy ass allllll the way down the cliff to collect my winnings. The one time I wished I had some PA.
---
10/10 would descend a sheer cliff again.
---
Cap collector as well.
---
Maybe with the dmg change in survival but in adventure its rarely unkillable if you dont have the same armor and jump/stim till someone runs out or moves. I can vat crit kill ppl even with pipe guns in survival but adventure I've ran into ass/sent players that take nothing from my rifle build. Only exception is the crit hit but if that doesnt kill them they'll get me before I get another crit
---
Yeah, I mean, I give less than a shit if somebody wants my workshop. I only take them for the plans, and occasionally for resources, but really I can better spend my time scrounging than trying to protect something that's ultimately ephemeral.
---
Sounds like this subreddit
---
Ditto, glad you're enjoying the game, happy trails :)
---
not sure what "lavianka" is, but the rest sounds legit.
---
Had a similar experience. Still not high level (30ish) but having fun for the most part
---
Gary?
---
forgot his name, but the mysterious stranger's son in fallout new Vegas, gave me chills, especially with Oxhorns video explaining how the mysterious stranger either encountered alien technology or is a synth
---
would you rather pay for something that repairs your armor to 100% or use some items you can easily find and some perks everyone has to repair your gear to 200%. free players has the edge. also everyone says a paying player can instantly repair their gear in battle, but your gear isnt breaking that often..and if you go into a fight with gear about to break, thats your own fault.
---
[Here’s what the statue and the explosion look like](https://youtu.be/gzd2ifDDKQw)
---
Blocker (45%) Lone Wanderer (20%) and Dodgy (30%) leave all melee attacks only inflicting 5% of their normal damage on you before your DR is even calculated. 
---
-&gt; this is not how damage is calculated. 
---
This is how it works:
---
Let’s say the damage output of your opponent is 1000. then with Blocker it would be 550. FROM THIS VALUE you take the 20% of Lone Wanderer, lowering the dmg to 440. From the 440 you subtract the 30% of Dodgy, lowering the dmg to 308. 
---
So with the perks you mentioned, you reduce the dmg to 30.8% of its initial value.
---
I didn’t know what was happening yesterday when a scorchbeast started dropping scorched from the sky. I was just minding my own business out in the wasteland. Then I started screaming and running around. They just killed me. Being level 22 sucks
---
*raises both hands*
---
I do have Speed demon mutation, but I thought that only applied to sprinting and reloading.
---
Zenimax was founded by Bethesda. Zenimax = Bethesda.
---
The beer kegs have to be one of Biv’s rewards. That’s a Nukashine asset.
---
I've mainly played by myself and I've enjoyed it quite a bit, I've played on and off since launch and I think I'm around lvl 50. I recently convinced one of my more open minded friends to play it and we love playing together. We recognize there are problems with the game, but we still love it. I'm on vacation for spring break rn and all the new updates are coming out which makes me depressed cuz I'm not home!. I'm excited to get home and level my character in preperation for the burrows! And discover what happened to poor Calvin.
---
I haven't played the game so I have no comment, and I'm not trying to debate the merits of pay to win items. I just came across that article while doing research. Maybe take it up with the author.
---
Yep. You got a taste of what it's like for free. Now you have to pay to get your "free" DLC.
---
Welcome to the new world; same as the old world.
---
Oh wow. Your kill count is soo big. Can I suck your e-penis now please?
---
It is not compatible with the pistol speed perk, so there's possibilities not compatible with that gun also.
---
Disregard. Lost server
---
My Ultra Cute power armor would be so fucking OP
---
Wait, so the only reason you bought the game was because people said it was bad? Thats some weird reverse peer pressure psychology.
---
Deleting your custom .ini should work, I had a similar problem
---
Warren could easily be raider territory
---
Down voted.
---
There’s a PA mod that reduces the dmg taken by 50% I think... Sent Ass isn’t as overpowered as the people in here like to complain.
---
New game mode: die from rads and have a 5% chance to turn into a feral ghoul.
---
It’s here, they posted a link on Twitter when it came out, here’s the link: https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/1QMBfEfLfsdy3ho9eYMoQ0/inside-the-vault-the-burrows-and-camera-preview?utm_source=Community&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;sf101158891=1
---
Level 43 launch day player checking in!
---
Thanks for the reply, appreciate it!
---
Better dead than red.
---
You mean like the Guild system in ESO? That can definitely work! Hopefully Bethesda does that soon. That'll definitely keep the game alive for years to come!: Have it so the leader can create the ranks/missions/events for the faction etc. Example: Someone can be Elder of the Brotherhood of Steel and do that, have hundreds of players join the faction/make new friends plus more especially with custom faction flags/insignias.
---
Holy shit this is so cool. I would love to run into something like this in Appalachia. Very terrifying
---
In terms of Quality of Life, the game you're playing is not the game that was released back in November. I'm glad you're enjoying it in its current state, but the vast majority of complaints about the game were valid at launch. Basically, the game is starting to approach an actual *launch-ready* state of development. Many PC-gamers are fine with this sort of 'early access games don't work right shenanigans', but many, many more are not. 
---
Kudos to BGS for getting there, but they still need to be taken to task for launching the game in the state they did.
---
You're five levels over the Lv50 I was trying to fight. I'm twenty under.
---
Damage scaling is a thing in both directions.
---
That is a fair point.  I’d imagine that if they are getting the legendary items, then the game is t generating them again for a little bit longer.
---
It would be nice to earn for myself at least one awesome item...
---
You’re now the equivalence of a free folk (GoT)
---
There's no Pay To Win.  People are dumb.  Don't listen to them.
---
I bought the PC version for $12 off of CDKeys.  You might have to use a VPN to redeem the code, but the game itself is not region locked.
---
All the platforms seem to have mostly good people and some jerks.  PC has mods though. ;)
---
One time.
---
I've ran it 3x so far. 1st time (1st day) was a clusterf*&amp;k, and failed. Other two we've downed it in under 10 minutes, with no real communication/coordination. Other than I assume most knew what to do at this point. Around 5-6 stims was what I've used on the last 2. The 1st was a blur, so I have no idea, lol.
---
Mixer dude 😀 all built into your xbox - start broadcasting via the menu, then when it's over mixer will save it as a video link you can share.
---
No pressure obviously but i think people would love to see that kind of content.
---
......and one strange bonus effect I’ve had on Xbox is it’s removed all of the grass around my camp, not complaining as it’s now a lot easier to find my gourd plants and loot any enemy bodies that have been killed by my turrets lol
---
Well in a part of it you can technically get into Ohio... just cross the river at Point Pleasant
---
I lost my best chest armor I was wearing. Not sure if it was right after the hotfix or during the multiple crash after. Now I just have to play 800 hours more to get another one.
---
By the tone of this post I can imagine what the tone of your last post was. It's probably not what you said but the way you said it. Down voted for that reason.
---
Just gotta summon the impister, and not kill it  so it can do its thing! /s
---
This is what I'm worried about. I'm kinda low level and want to be helpful during the event, but I don't want to blow through 20 stims at the moment. Was thinking of putting it off until at least level 50, but everyone's going to lose interest in it by the time I get there. I guess I'll go and just die a lot!
---
Thanks for the link! The bigger issue for me is, why Bethesda is so slow to act on anything. I tried to wave my hands in the air Fallout 76 emoji style yesterday on their forums, but they STILL haven't fixed it. The article is undated, which is probably why it's not showing up on their site news feed, so I assume it should be a very easy "flip the switch" type deal in their CMS.
---
True. Worth consideration. Thank you.
---
Aaaaand now you are going to get downvote spammed again. Good job.
---
Yep. A lot of people in here (or in the gaming community in general) see themselves as the god given thing to gaming. They act like they ate wisdom with a spoon and don’t see other opinions as viable.
---
Good to know. I'm surprised they don't ban for using mods though.
---
At least a month ago, I had Hemlock Holes attacked by some squatch things.  I didn't go to defend for several reasons, but I swear its a thing that happened.  I know, I sound like one of the problems.  I don't know if it was a mistake in the patch or what.  Its never happened since then.  So, I believe they're out there.
---
Upvoted, then downvoted...
---
Awesome, I do have a VPN so I'll check this out. Thanks for the suggestion, probably wouldn't have known about this otherwise
---
I second that down vote and might even login with my alts to get access to my stashed down votes.
---
Wait what is this overcharged madness you speak of?
---
I did this intentionally to highlight the problem.  It shouldn’t matter how I said it you dumb cunts.  In reality if you’re wrong, you’re wrong.  It’s backwards as fuck to make someone who is right wrong, just for the sake of doing it.  I’m glad this wasn’t the format when geniuses spawned into our society, as they would have all been killed off by backwards savages like yourself.  Tea
---
but you brought it up, and you only seem to take in biased opinions. you need to develop a skill to think about what a game has and what enjoyment you can get out of it, instead of waiting for people to feed opinions to you. when you do that, you wouldnt be on message boards asking where to penny pinch a game cause you are nervous about the reviews.
---
Yep. The other thing to watch for is when there is a specific workshop challenge. This week it's Take Thunder Mountain Workshop, so I checked it out on the map and sure enough there was a high level on the map just a 10 second run from the workshop. Dude was obviously just waiting for someone to take it so he could farm a random player for caps. Needless to say I didn't go.
---
Last week (?) the challenge was to take Berkley Springs Workshop. A friend I was teamed with insisted we take it so I claimed it first then went into stealth mode. As he was teasing me about being paranoid I checked the map and saw a new player fast travel there. I server hopped, but he stayed behind and it turns out it was someone he'd killed in the game before over workshop, as this player just does this thing - PvPs in workshops for caps. They ended up having a conversation and the guy said he said my name sounded like I was a pushover (I am - my build is not min-maxed for PvP because I don't like it) and I should be "an easy kill."
---
So yeah. Workshop PvP benefits wimps who can't handle Survival, but don't want to bother playing Adventure.
---
Sale + Microsoft Rewards = basically free.
---
Have behemoths at least always being legendary would be a start.  They can be kind of a pain at times.
---
I think they made items inspectable in vendors again. I noticed I can now inspect to see what all the stars are for on a multi star legendary before I buy it.
---
I can't wait for you to get to the DMV quest line.
---
Yes. You yourself do not have to start it, spend the caps/flux/mats at all. You only spend a card if YOU initiate the event. It sends a serverwide notification when someone starts it.
---
I have done this fight four times, being a conduit each time. The first time I got bitch slapped because I didn't know what to expect, but after that I started jumping on the roof of the shack and going at the thing with a rifle. I don't think I've died while doing that, and I haven't been burning through stims.
---
I still haven't completed the quest on my own, though I'm about halfway through it. I'm sure a lot of players are just jumping into the fight with no idea what the deal is.
---
Yep now they’ll downvote you because you took my side.  Thanks for that bravery.
---
Interesting, I’ll have to check and see if it’s similar on PS4
---
How many white fedoras equal that outfit in value? Cuz I gots a lot em!
---
I have a job working for a company sort of like Bethesda, but we make software for a specific medical niche so it's much less glamorous. We use change management and have a step between dev and deploy. No way you could have known that, but I had to laugh when I read your comment. As others have mentioned, I think we're still playing the beta.
---
Anyway, thanks for your opinion that I shouldn't have an opinion! Keep makin' it great for everyone you meet, sunshine!
---
I used to take workshops and built out elaborate rest stops for players with every amenity, but now that players are farming people for caps, I don't bother. 
---
It sucks when the game gets less playable.
---
Oh okay so what are the locations I should go to for that? There’s WesTech, Watoga, what else?
---
You could be the smartest person in the world, but act like an enormous asshole and no one will want to hear you. Downvoted.
---
I've had a lot of good experiences on PS4 personally, but I think all around it's a pretty good player community. If you join us in Playstationland feel free to hit me up! I love helping new players out and would be happy to make you some decent armor or weapons. Offer goes for anyone, btw.
---
I got this game 5 hours ago and haven't put it down yet. I loved FO4 so this felt like stepping into some favorite comfortable shoes. Got to level 5, took it easy for most of the time, stumbled into a group of friends and while they were teaching me about the game we got jumped by 2 scorchbeasts. Good fun and I'm glad Im forming my own opinion of the game.
---
OK man, I was just asking where to get the game cheaply, and I wasn't aware of the biased nature of the first article I came across when googling the game. That's my bad.
---
I'll have to give that a shot. I didn't even think of that, since.. y'know, it's gas/acid and sonic concussions. But hey, if it works, I'll take it.
---
Thanks for the post.  I thought this was a small statue like the Deatchclaw one and had no interest.  Now I do.
---
You've got lots of the Impostor Outfit or of the Fedoras?
---
You asking for upvotes is about as cringy as sombody on Instagram asking for comments if you think cancer is bad
---
Good timing. The game is just about almost release quality at this point. Everyone who told you it was trash wasn't wrong. The game has gotten a lot better since launch.
---
Thanks for the feedback! Sometimes a quick nod in one's general direction makes a world of difference.
---
I want to test this now. Hmm. I’ll go acquire the outfit soon for this. Thank you for bringing this to light.
---
OP is simply an asshole, that's why the downvotes. He didn't even try to politely argue.
---
It's only a requirement if YOU want to start/initiate the event. If someone else does it doesn't cost you a card or any mats. Just the fast travel cost to the event and your assumed ammo/healing you use.
---
True point.  Hopefully it will bring about some cool changes.
---
But if it has the same poor randomness that the 3* drop seems to have, then I’m a little worried
---
A lot of people have had that message pop up with their workshops, but when they go to defend it ends up being something else (normal) attacking. I think Bethesda has been purposefully sending that false message to build up the mystery/hype behind the cryptid
---
White wolf fedoras
---
If you have xbox add me! OG Mr4w350m3
---
What console?
---
You’re fucking dumb, and I wish your parents had dropped you harder and from higher heights.
---
Thanks for the in depth response. Could you list your card build and mutations for me if it's not too much trouble. I run a sniper build but (as I have posted on here before) can't seem to get my BE Gauss to hit harder than my TSE Gauss...this is the same with my handmades. I run with adrenal reaction and the numbers stack in favour of the TSE the lower my health. In fact this is the case with all my rifles , paid a lot of caps for an AAE handmade which appears again to run behind the TSE one I also have. I'm thinking of selling the BE Gauss because it's just space in my stash at the moment because of this...
---
I know PC is best but I love the convenience of my PS4 Pro working correctly every time I logon to play FO76.
---
The Fixer does not give you a movement speed bonus if you already have a movement speed bonus from Speed Demon, Squad   Maneuvers, Overdrive Servos (Power Armor Leg Mod), or the Sleek modification attached to your leg armor. 
---
It appears as thought Bethesda has created a flat cap of 20% on Movement Speed increases. 
---
So you can’t get a movement speed increase of more than 20%. Unlike Fallout 4 where movement speed stacked.
---
Yeah, I have no idea. I would offer the Fedora + Caps for the Impostor Outfit.
---
Thanks for sharing your opinion here as someone not biased due to the state this game was released in. I am a huge fan of the Fallout series and hoped I could get my wife to like it too but honestly 76 wasn’t the best choice for her first contact with the lore and setting in general. 
---
I tried to talk her into giving it another chance but the betas and the first two weeks left such a bad impression on her and our friends that we never touched it since. My next step will be buying the New Vegas Ultimate Collection for the 360 as that is both backwards compatible and the only way of playing the uncensored version of my favorite installment. (Stupid German censorship) Hopefully this will change her mind and at least the two of us can check out the new and improved F76 with 200lb extra space in our storage box and whatever else they fixed.
---
Btw are private servers live already?
---
Right lol
---
Yeah it doesn't make any sense to me either, but it definitely made the queen fight and fighting groups of SBs easier.
---
That is an interesting take on legendary creatures.  It would make the fight harder for lower level players and longer for some higher level guys out there.
---
Good idea!
---
I never have an issue, and PC gets hot fixes for shit you have to wait a whole week to get fixed!  PLEB we never had random item disappearances or any of the other PS4 specific bugs
---
BGS could have the Cuyahoga on fire for realism - AND go as far West as Cincy for their never used Subway System.
---
To be fair. They didn't make you bring junk to an event that you likely knew was more challenging than normal. The event is pretty generous with player deaths, almost to the point that it's better to die than to heal.
---
I think to drop something harder you must through it
---
It is not. Why are you lying to him?
---
I agree that workshop pvp needs some attention, but in the meantime...
---
As a deterrent to someone contesting your workshop, make as many improvements as you can.
---
So, have you noticed that sometimes when you initiate claiming a workshop it's either 25 caps, or some other random amount. Well, the added cap cost is because they're are items built by other players.
---
Someone might decide to move on when they see it costing 80 caps to contest.
---
PER mutation, you've tested that?  
---
I thought all the "Mutant's XXX" weapons say:
---
"Does x% bonus damage when mutated" - meaning, whether you had 1, or 15 mutations, it would still do 15% (total) more damage because of the mutation(s).  Are you right, or am I right?
---
Really not helping yourself out here. Please leave the 76 community, we don't want you.
---
It's a little fuzzy on what they allow.  I take it as "They don't support mods and if you break something you are on your own"
---
The only one I use us Perk Loadout, which is a godsend.
---
Hence the fucking problem dipshit.
---
Or, you don’t take your junk to one of the hardest activities at the moment. 
---
„But that was junk I collected during the event“
---
You’re supposed to activate pylons and kick some sheep ass. Leave the junk till the event is over.
---
Problem solved and we didn’t even need the developer for it! Wow!
---
Whining about being downvoted, calls everyone counts. Computes perfectly.
---
yea...it happens...it happens with the Queen, it even happens at WhiteSprings...not really nothing you can do about it.
---
And unfortunately we dont live in a wonderland so we cant all get what we wish for.    Sorry proncess
---
Your a count too, count cuntula
---
On top of it, the player who killed us didn't even complete the taking over the Workshop so there was no penalty for them whatsoever, they contested the workshop, killed us, left, and we were still vulnerable to the next cap collector to due the same. Our only option was to leave the server as we couldn't voluntarily abandon the workshop. Seems like if you contest a workshop, kill the owner, you should then be automatically attached to it, with all of the risks. As he was lvl 187, his risk would be much greater than what was earned through his actions
---
Princesses *
---
I did not downvote you, but, out of curiosity, why did you think that?
---
Ps4 unfortunately
---
Wow. Where do people get this useful info? I have no clue. Thanks, man. That helps a lot.
---
I read in the reddit that it’s a Biv reward but a few people said that the commenter was a liar
---
The daily and weekly challenges have gotten more difficult since around the time of the brewing additions, and I'm glad to see others have noticed it too. To me, this clearly represents a move to become less generous with the Atoms which is a shame considering this is a $60 game. Ideally, the way they'd encourage sales wouldn't be by being stingy with the free ways to earn Atoms, but instead by providing so much cool stuff in the Atomic shop that you'd want to spend money to buy it since your already generous daily/weekly Atom allowance wouldn't be enough for it all at once.
---
I might poach that outfit if you tell me what type of shotgun or Gatling gun you consider good. Specific designation or type?
---
Please leave earth, you are clearly to sensitive to be right at anything
---
Seems to be fine for me. I‘m on PS4. But experiences vary.
---
Or a perk card trade option for a randomly selected card
---
I got it last night and I _did_ plan on using it in survival BUT it won't let me paint it with the Atom Shop skin making it LITERALLY UNUSABLE. NO STARS.
---
Seriously tho it's just going in the box. Maybe a display case later. I did want to use it in survival but the bonuses make it pretty situationally dependent and it won't displace my work-a-day anti-armor lever rifle walking 'round gun. It's not _bad_ just not what I prefer. Also it doesn't help that after the updates Survival mode went from Deathmatch to a co-op walking simulator in hard mode, so nobody's really killing anyone anymore.
---
It would be nice if someone can confirm if any drop from other events like SBQ or just killing wild creatures.
---
Typical upvoted comment in this scenario
---
Clever
---
Lmao was it actually on fb? That’s great
---
People just droppin the fedoras at the event like a gotdamn toothy man mask at the fasnacht!
---
Haha thanks😂
---
Wow botched that one duke of pointless argument points
---
So with those games, valve specially built it's own compressed image format that is also used by sprays. What happens in the server when a player encounters a spray is that the information is sent from the player who owns the spray's computer to the server, then to a temp folder in the receiving player's computer. The file is not saved in anyway on the valve server.
---
Now, this works because 1) the engine was specially built to use image files and compress them in a way that they can be used as textures, and 2) the images were compressed to a very low resolution, and we're only sent once per viewing of the image.
---
Now, imagine if Bethesda decided to entirely rework how their textures work in order to create a compressed image format to facilitate this kind of in game image sharing. They would then have to contend with the fact that nowadays, people have 4k Monitors, which are what the screenshots ingame would be at in terms of resolution. If someone plops into the server with their camp that is full floor to ceiling with 4k Beauty shots of Appalachia, and say everyone in the server has image sharing enabled, the entire server would freeze for at least a minute while it sends out those huge packets to everyone in the server. Repeat for every person that joins, and every camp that is spawned with pictures in it.
---
Lmao I renamed my ultracite to ultra cute
---
Still an issue even after their server maintenance
---
Hey OP, did you fap today and break your confidence, you poor soul? Or did you make some shitty tiny art no one likes? Get out of here. You incel fucks are ruining good places.
---
Still same for me also 😤 any ideas how we get bethesdas attention ?
---
I’m glad you feel a  part of something.  Now jump into the lava with everyone else, and help to ensure that this earth never has to deal with your idiotic, sheltered children
---
That every community. This one is actually one of the better ones. Check out any madden  community lol
---
Junk jet could work, if each piece of junk you put in it added a certain amount of shots to an ammo counter, and shot copies of random crap that can't be picked up.. and despawned quickly
---
u/eckserah can shed some light I believe. He's done the hard work with the datamining.
---
Please, help us to locate all of the dumbest.  We’re sorting for a purge here
---
I noticed this last night too while trying to repair some weapons. It also didn't show my BSS condition right either.
---
Really? Cause what’s changed honestly that’s major and noteworthy. I’ve been on and off since launch and every time I get on, it feels the same. 
---
I hate when I go into specific game subs and people posts comments saying the game is so much better since launch when barely anything is even different. There are a decent amount of QOL changes that have been fixed and a few additions but the game is still the same. 
---
Quests are point to point holotape collecting nonsense. CAMPs are too small with a quarter of the selection of objects as FO4. The atom shop is still a shit topic and the dailies are in favor of making you spend money. 
---
The game has a long way to go.
---
Honeslty would buy that
---
I’m actual with you on the retardedness of some of the complainers, my dude. Was just being silly.
---
Raises flag with hand on it
---
ohh got it.. so the guys that "roleplay" as raiders and ruin everyone else's fun are the ones that can't cut it in pubg or fortnite correct? so no using machined weapons, or x01 armor, just straight raider stuff huh? wait no?
---
Raider faction flag
---
Maybe so.  But they seemed to have worked
---
I have a bloodied limb damage one right now, will probably be a while before I can get my hands on a better one anyway
---
Yes
---
Full agreement from me to let console have it
---
Abusing people with genuine criticism and rational interpretation is exactly why you’re being down voted.
---
Name calling? Downvote
---
Patronising? Downvote
---
Disregard for legitimate criticism? Downvote
---
Generalising a group as not understanding because they won’t specifically see your way? Downvote
---
Yes rendering is a thing, yes specs make the difference, no you can’t dehumanise them for it.
---
Says someone who can't get laid, has a problem with fapping and makes shit "art". GTFO.
---
Have as much suspicion of positive hype as you do negative hype.
---
Very insightful! Thank you for posting as that basically cleared up everything I wanted to know.
---
Even if you have a point, this post as well as your general attitude is ddeplorable and deserving of any downvotes you receive. Grow the fuck up.
---
You're one of the douciest douce bags I've ever seen on here bitching about being downvoted and losing fake internet points and calling people "plebs" whatever in the hell that is I don't live in Moms basement so IDK or care. 
---
Let me know when your big boy hair comes in maybe then you'll have a civilized conversation.
---
Enjoy the downvotes
---
Pump shotgun, Two shot or explosive. Same with gatling.
---
Figured that's why he's so angry needs to go fuck something.
---
*sigh*, no, I'm not "making up a definition" I simply have a better understanding than you do.
---
As far back as 1987 when I was working on developing a mulitplayer online RPG I thought of adding "special" unique or powerful magic items to be auctioned off, in order to support the cost of running servers.
---
I'm so glad I did not do that, even if it would have made me a multi-millionaire, I would have felt like a complete shithead for being one of the pioneers of selling video game cheats.
---
I don't know why you have such a hard time understanding how adding on the selling of items which give you and advantage in a multiplayer game is so blatantly, obviously ***cheating*** to anyone with a clear understanding of the topic - you have some strong desire to rationalize that this is OK?  Some kind of vested interest?
---
Also, do you not see the terrible implications it has on the gaming world?  The way it twists developers - perhaps a little at first, but them more later, as they get hooked on selling cheats and think of more devious and awful ways to "encourage" players to feel like they *need* these cheats just to *keep up with the other players* who are buying them?
---
Clash Royale is a particularly heinous example which illustrates the problem of Pay To Cheat very well.
---
Either you are a dedicated troll, or you just refuse to see this for what it is, it's absolutely not just "me making up definitions".  Come on, get a grip.
---
On PC and reports of freezing during busy events are rampant. Anecdotally disconnects have increased for me.
---
Well let’s get all of the MOST USED responses out of the way.  Please, try again.  And while you’re at it, please spam your testicles in the nearest microwave and start until your future children thank you for not having to be raised under such a dipshit
---
I was speaking more to it in the context of people posting porn and gore and all kinds of disgusting nasty shit (literally and figuratively).
---
That just might get my wife to play the game.
---
The mating rituals were definitely just because Calvin wanted to bang the sheep.
---
Okay BETH, okay, I see you.  Well played.
---
That would be really cool, but I don't think this will ever happen: the game framework doesnt fit with such mechanic.
---
This makes me happy too. It's always best when you get the last laugh as the pacifist
---
Even better. You can REALLY go and make everything better for them. Like I said... show them  how it's done. Fix their methods. 
---
Everyone's entitled to an opinion. But the people with first hand knowledge? Their opinions matter a hell of a lot more.
---
Lmao don’t it’s level 100😂

I have spent an entire week in survival mode, and I can tell you cap farming there for me has not been a thing. I killed around 46 players last week and I would say about 90% of them did not have caps. So many people enter without caps for he fear of losing them and no repercussions for not giving them up that only losing 25% of your level is fine by me. Actually makes me want to keep fighting someone who is either good or got the drop on me.
---
I had a gamestop employee tell me more than once I could return it in within 7 days for a full refund. It's been like 3 weeks now, never thought about it for a second.
---
Most used because your pathetic, sad, incel ass splashed it all over the internet. Your life is so sad you have to act like an asshole for attention. Everyone here knows it.
---
AAE should be lower on nominal damage because AA doesn't increase it. BE vs TSE is curious though. Can you post some damage numbers at various health levels?
---
I have wanted this myself. Would be great have mods and legendary perks on PA

PS4 user here. Never had these issues. I'm also very glad you're mom was nice enough to buy you a good gaming PC. Does the humidity in her basement effect performance.

If Deathclaw needs help, how does that prove him "fiercest in the wasteland". Regardless of that, this sounds fun.

Hell yeah!

Fully Modded X01 w/jet pack and quantum paint

Hunters Longcoat

Quite a few rare plans, from new event and prime plans.
---
For a hit to register I believe that you have to be targeting the enemy with your crosshair. Just having the weapon pass through the enemy isn't going to cut it.
---
Also, vats melee was stealth nerfed a while back when they fixed "vats ranged always misses first shot"
---
I would, but if you speak out against Bethesda on here you get downvoted constantly. 
---
Follow the sheeple..
---
No problem 😄
---
You must be from that state up north.
---
I just keep hoping that when the legendary vendor comes out we will get some kind of re-roll mechanic. If that's the case then the assassin mode is getting trashed. You are right about survival, but just for this week. Every other week it's still been a blood bath, but because of the weekly reward everyone has been working together. Next week the reward is the Fatman but I don't know what the challenge will be. Watch it be "Kill 100 players with explosives" or something crazy like that. What other stats does your anti-armor lever have?
---
Sheepsquatchles?
---
Yes!
---
It seems like the game is designed for non -Power Armor players as all of the legendary protective gear is regular Armor 
---
It’s time to say Power Armor should be stronger than regular armor
---
I can now see why you get down voted I bet the last time you had p#ssy was when your hand touched your mom's p#ssy when she had you.

Do you get aroused talking about the specs of your PC let's see Nvida Quadro P6000 ( do you like it when I talk sexy) move out of your mom's house and get a job also fresh air won't hurt you or sunlight.

I encountered this today.

Let's talk about it....

&gt;i think most raiders started off at the whitespring and moved up the mountain following the events of the Christmas drowning

Considering the raiders caused the Christmas drowning when one of the leader's girlfriend was captured after leaving the great divide, I think you're quite off here.
---
It's a really good time for someone to start playing Fo76, the bugs have been ironed out, polish is better than ever, and new content rolling weekly.

It really is crazy to think that even someone whos job is to sell jumps on that hatewaggon lol even after the improvment that ive heard about
---
I think OP was referring to the crop dusting. I agree that if you are seeking shelter it should provide some.  It isn't as bad as it was in the beginning.  It will get better. Someday you will be able to say screw that, your ass is mine! Lol

That was a fun one!

maybe you get downwotes for your username? people like to fap.

Here we go. We've reached "Maximum Troll". Critical Mass. Nowhere left to go.

I had to stash 30k from my pvp alt so far. I don't go to fight capsless, but at 25k its kinda wasteful not to stash it.

yeah its bad on PS4 too, very disappointing...

It doesn't have to be gamebreaking mods, just something fun to add in the loottables.

What you got had a message and anotner guy has some pieces.
---
Yea but why the hell dont they just post on Reddit. -.-
---
Well reading his comments in this thread, I have to agree on the asshole part. But my opinion on some people in here (subreddit, not directly this thread) stays the same nevertheless.
---
Good for you!
---
It would be nice if you could choose certain ranks for each card if you have it fully leveled. It would help reduce clutter while trying to swap out perks, and it would encourage trying out different sets. The only issue I see with it is the implementation, I'm sure there would be glitches and bugs that come from it.
---
I doubt that honestly, that initiation price is not enough of a deterrent.
---
I glad to hear that I’m not alone in this idea!
---
It’s crazy to me that there are no legendary items for Power Armor....
---
I mean it’s crazy right?!?
---
Some of the legendary stats on certain armors can add up to be better than PA. You also loose all your buffs when you enter PA too without gaining any.
---
Reddit is the only reliable info source I know of. It's all on here.
---
Holy crap! I was going to buy one and put it on the table next to the deathclaw on my table. Guess that's a no go.
---
Haha well it was a great effort imo :)
---
Thanks for the laugh man
---
K..just going on now..it has to be my card set up.
---
Rad storms are independent of nukes, majority people have seen less then a handful while launching tons of nukes.
---
Sounds like this will be a thing. Apparently if you connect your vending machine to power it shows your camp location on the map. This will really help to get more traffic.
---
This is why I would like the game design to discourage PvP on adventure and set it loose on survival.
---
Some kind of tie-in with the a half-dressed member of the Kardashian clan should break it pretty well dead for days if not weeks...
---
It is fun and it has a charm about it that sucks me back in frequently. But when it was released it had more issues than any online game I've personally played.
---
It still has issues, but the last two updates (especially the last one) give me a lot of hope for the future of the game
---
Wow, the amount of ignorant/stubborn people (or perhaps people with a vested interest) who insist on arguing against calling this sort of thing \*\*\*what it is\*\*\*, is astounding:
---
**Selling/buying something with cash, instead of earning it through playing, in the game, is cheating pure and simple, it's cut-and-dry - senseless to argue that it is not!**
---
*If we don't take a firm stance against Pay To Cheat, it's going to keep spreading and getting worse like a festering disease infecting the world of video games.  Very very sad.*
---
Yeah and even when I was buying it I was like "I've heard the bad stuff but I've heard they made huge improvements. And for $30 Im totally willing to gamble on it." At least he sold me the Tricentennial with a working code, so not all bad
---
There is a huge disadvantage to even playing a Power Armor build!
---
It’s time that should change for certain
---
same goes for the surround atmosphere sounds and the weapon effects. should be separated.
---
Gutted he's dead already, would've made a sick companion. Know exactly what you mean saying he's like a main character who ended up dying.

They can make a king deathclaw thats bigger or something lol. Don't get caught an the alpha identifier, I just mean a top tier deathclaw taking down a top tier scorchbeast

Who the hell designed this thing, Mr. Torgue!?
---
How’d you get a jet pack? I just started, is it something I’ll get just from doing quests?
---
This has been suggested by every person I played the Main Quest with since the B.E.T.A.
---
I think it’s fairly obvious to anyone playing in a group that the Holotapes are quieter than your teammates gunfire, your teammates talking into your ear, and significantly quieter than the game world in which we are listening to said Holotapes. 
---
Give us a slider for the Holotapes Bethesda. Some of us have less than stellar hearing.
---
Somehow I stumbled into the Basic Training quest at the same time as a high level who was doing the BoS end. It was early days, so I glitched into getting all of his quest markers, including the DMV. Lordamercy, that was confusing! Then he fast-traveled into the Bog and left me all alone with my little number and no clue what the heck I was doing it for.
---
Good times.
---
The community still playing is great actually. Feel comfortable to go up to players and invite to party and let them join you on your quest. Ask them to give you recipes, craft items for you, give away ammo/armor. A lot of players have to much in their inventory they just want to get rid of it! This is community is keeping the game alive and I agree, it's great game still!
---
We did. But she was killing us as soon as we did. Her health went down fairly quick. But she was mopping the floor with all our melee characters.
---
I replayed fallout 4 and honestly, 76's lack of human npcs isn't that bad. Most of the characters in fallout 4 only gave out a couple of lines of dialogue and hardly had any story to them. Even the characters you interact with barely had any character to them either and the terrible dialogue options made me cringe.
---
Plus most of the time, you are exploring the wastes and not in towns so 76 isn't that big of a departure. It simply dumped half baked characters and terrible dialogue in favor of decent to good audiobook-like snippets.
---
Spec critcards in luck, then u will be fine 🤘
---
XD calm down lmao
---
This guy is SO FUCKING SAD, check his profile, he complains about nude mods for FO4 making him fap and destroy his precious incel confidence :( You can't make this shit up. No reason to ever engage with someone this pathetic.

This is the biggest issue. High level characters can never take workshops anymore because of the contesting exploit. If you are 200+, you will be ganked within 5 minutes of taking a workshop.
---
I have one I can sell you.
---
Grafton steel to be correct. That was 2 days ago. Upon me relogging, I haven't been able to find any plans in the locker. Might be people has also figured out the location.
---
the outfit or helmet
---
Imposter head
---
I understand that spot, and why that’s frustrating but I don’t think that white springs entirely should be blocked off. 
---
Usually they don’t allow camps to be placed that close to a town/building so they could just extend the restricted zone around the golf club so people wouldn’t be allowed to do that. 
---
I mean if it happens it happens, my main grievance is seeing players purposely attack camps and destroy them when someone hasn’t done anything to them.
---
PvP against dedicated alts is a waste of time. They are expecting to die and it's just mindless killing. 
---
The real prizes are the high levels skulking around the map not expecting to be ambushed. They're think they're safe but if you track them back to their house or catch them out in the field, rewards abound.
---
What a guy
---
Sort of yes.  If ya just started dont wanna spoil anything for ya. But yes, some questline will get ya the opportunity if ya have enough caps to get a mod for an armor.. or plans to make it can drop, or be bought from vendors
---
hmu my dude right away, 2800 caps is what i give you. my ig name is Falloutboy761
---
I remember I left the Siren turned on in my Camp
---
4 hours later went back to my camp and No one bothered to turn it off but i'm pretty sure someone still searched for that noisy Siren since the door is open
---
I’ll add you now (from the PS4 app I’m definitely at work lol) and hopefully we can get you to 100 again ASAP
---
stealth boiiis ofc and related perk.
---
Yep I’m swinging at everything 2-3 times before I hit them. Sometimes it isn’t registering my instigating (double damage if enemy is at full health) because my second landed hit will do a lot more. Bethesda You nerf the TSE weapons and make melee for PVE the meta and it doesn’t work correctly.
---
#we have found a genius#
---
Funny I'm the opposite, now that I know it's size I can skip it, hoped it was like my little vault boy and deathclaw lawn gnomes.
---
Yup, I have encountered this as well.  It does need fixing.
---
Oh yeah I’m pretty sure that shouldn’t happen, mine just stops whenever I pull the trigger but I have to say he reloads those 20 bullets faster than humanly possible without error

I run around hacking the bots to take them out. Seldom get sheep loot, just quest rewards.

Also, I don't mind annoying PC players, because they are always messing with things and tweaking and then complaining that game sucks and doesn't work. Never thinking maybe they borked something on their end.

Nope, how about East KY to Lexington? Adds another city while keeping the Appalachia feel. Plus, 2 headed Thoroughbred horses to ride in the apocalypse!

I (and most people?) play video games ***TO ESCAPE FROM REALITY*** where I may be too poor to buy a Lamborghini Huracan, or be wealthy enough to attract a harrem of shallow beautiful women who simply want to fuck me because I'm rich, or to afford a bunch of lawyers to get me out of deep shit because I wanted to do something *BAD*.  
---
I play video games to escape from my inadequacies IRL, to live out fantasies - to be who I want to be, or do things I can't do IRL.    
---
If some asshole game dev wants to give us the slap in the face that ruins this for us - just bring back the class system from our reality and shit it on our faces in games too - oh, you want to be powerful in the game?  Well then, are you rich?  Because you'll have to spend a ton of money if you wanna have a good time in your fantasy world...
---
Absolutely fucking do not let this spread and fester - it's not too late to fight back against this most awful bullshit greed.
---
# Seriously, FUCK PAY TO CHEAT, sideways, with a giant cactus!
---
Like the lazy river tubes theirs like 4 of hem at my camp and they get in the way
---
sure thing, contact me when you are able to trade
---
Oh yeah that is weird looking. And super weird that happened because of that statue. But nothing in 76 surprises me anymore
---
And refunds offered to anyone who bought the game at least in part, due to those assurances (as I did).
---
Don't un-do it on PC. Big battles have never run so smooth.
---
Yeah, get a set of armor with a prefix that says " doesn't count as armor for chameleon". It is absolutely necessary for harder content. Like it or not, you will take a hit eventually
---
Update - eventually a legendary albino deathclaw spawned and followed me to the fissure. Thanks again!!
---
Prostitution outside of a Walmart.
---
I know when mutants and ghouls are right in my face and I swing I shouldn’t miss. Something has been changed since the last patch.
---
You'll have less karma than me in no time
---
Same happened to me this morning, done the event 3 times now and failed them all due to different issues, it’s soul destroying, starting to question myself how badly I want the rewards, on one occasion it was visible but took no damage whatsoever and had 100% healthbar throughout despite all the pilons being on and everyone  hitting it, I had P.A, TSE .50cal, all the heavy gunner perks equipped, adrenal,reaction, bloody mess, tenderiser, etc, big guns bobblehead, magazine with minus 25% robot damage, all the toys basically, and even with this set up I’m getting nowhere, I’m sure I won’t get anything other than a crappy white fedora if I do complete it so I feel like just hanging onto my stimpacks and giving it a miss :(
---
This. Adventure pvp should be about contesting resources.
---
Sentinel Power Armor
---
Finally coming true
---
That is super cool! I want one now lol :)
---
Is this a real thing?
---
Oh the game has a tonne of potential! At launch it completely deserved all of the hate but they're slowly been correcting the game a fair bit. The lack of NPCs still hurts the game overall though (shut up robots and AI don't count!). While the story does revolve around why there are no people left it quickly becomes a massive immersion breaker when every single quest to find somebody will result in a 100% chance of dead body, every faction is completely dead regardless of their resources and knowledge, and the reason for the lack of NPCs does not effect the players or make too much sense.
---
( Story spoilers here to explain that so don't open if you don't want any: &gt;!The scorched plague killed everybody or turned them, but why are there no survivors huddled in bunkers, ruins, or the Whitespring? Plus the player doesn't get the vaccine until a fair bit after fighting a lot of scorched so they would be 110% infected by that point. Bethesda basically went "it's a super powered hive mind zombie plague!" but forgot to have survivors in camps and that the main character should get infected too. If you really think nobody could survive it then; life uh, finds a way.!&lt;)
---
The game is probably going to be awesome after another year or so but it's slow going and lots of stuff needs to happen before that like factions and the return of human NPCs. For the meantime though the mid game is still decent if pretty dry and the endgame is slowly improving.
---
Seeing as how Redits karma system is based on popularity, and not actual good deeds (in this case, my holy seed shot all over the idiots in an attempt to wake them up) I don’t actually care
---
Someone datamined a few lines of code for a couple Legendary Power Armor effects last week. 
---
At the least it showed that the Legendary prefix “Almost Unbreakable” and “Weightless” are being worked on for Power Armor by Bethesda. 
---
Since the Purveyor Weapon vendor has Power Armor pieces on display will that maybe be where we get our Legendary Power Armor from? I’m excited to find out.
---
Glad it all worked out! :)
---
It would be a better idea to make it if you die with over 50 rads then you have the chance because I've been playing 200 hours now and still haven't died of rads yet.
---
Just a suggestion I'm not saying your idea is bad.
---
What's the general consensus on the Tesla Shotgun for PVP and PVE. I picked up a 1* Legendary Suppressors Tesla Shotty from somewhere. Havnt tried it much yet, only a few low level mobs. Apparently, even though it is a shotgun it still uses fusion cells and still benefits from rifleman perks.
---
We're aware and working on this one.
---
Nooooo.. it would shoot out bubble popping purple hearts.❤❤
---
To me, when I hear you say that, it's like:
---
I don't see a problem with the natives eating a few Chimps...  
---
Then: EBOLA!  
---
Games like Clash Royale are the Ebola of the gaming world.  I don't want this shit to spread to my beloved PC games also - it's fucking vile and disgusting and Evil - I don't care if you "start small" - that's like saying: here, have a little baggie of crystal meth, it won't hurt you (it's the getting addicted and getting more that destroys lives).
---
And the US is a representative republic. Which has precisely zero to do with its capitalist system; same with Denmark's monarchy and its socialist system. If you can't grasp the difference between economics and government, then you're unqualified to be discussing this. Bro.
---
I prefer my unyielding armor because 30 agility is great.
---
Escort mission to help him reserve his strength for the final bout. Then you get to watch the resulting battle which has unique character animations and more stylized fighting.
---
Well for me its the thrill of the chase not the loot that is the main driving force so I focus myself on dedicated PvP alts even if it'd be more profitable to hunt junk hoarders. I'm already at the point where I need to unload lots of loot daily if I want to store these diesease cures and antibiotics somewhere. I could employ people to pickup my loot for 50% cut lol.
---
Sheeplesquatch.  He roams Reddit, downvoting anything that doesn't conform to popular opinion!
---
Personally would prefer one of two things
---
1) We aren't forced into PVP till he head to the location of the workshop
---
or
---
2) No pvp period and ownership stays as long as host doesn't leave\*
---
\*I prefer 2nd option since I know the adventure community is mostly friendly and would open it up to possibly making owned workshops free travel points and places where players and can work together and get free resources
---
This is my first online game i play on PS4 I have played since launch, as much as I didn’t want to play because of the bugs there is just something that hooks you, now I have learnt so much more about builds etc... I love it,my only gripe is needing people to do certain things as I’m 53 and  none of my friends play so if there’s anyone out there that’s wants to add me I look forward to teaming up My name is nuttynana2001.
---
The one time I accidentally scrap a calibrated leg and then this
---
Maybe the democrats should run him against Trump in 2020.
---
I see what you did there
---
Did you find calibrated shocks in there?
---
I seem to find ok stuff. But more often than not what does drop is under leveled and not 3 stars. In 165 levels I probably found 10 legendaries that are considered top tier. I'm guessing I probably sold some decent stuff accidentally because I didn't inspect the item or didn't realize what I had.
---
It would be cool if the game tracked all your stats. I wonder how many legendaries I've killed since the beginning?
---
Whitesprings?
---
Yes. Upvoting
---
I have been playing since launch. Playing despite the bad talking and despite the bugs which will eventually be worked out. I think it is a lot of fun!
---
I'll definitely come by!, only problem is will have to be Monday or Tuesday  because I'm visiting family in a mother state, if I remember I'll msg when I get on (In a few days)
---
No.  It's a skin for the ordinary "attach to one foundation" stair.
---
But it's very nice.
---
That would be even more awesome ! Great idea :)
---
Please don’t play with our emotions... :-/ 
---
Is this for real?  Source?
---
He's gone now. The game took him away from me, same as my mirelurk king. I only have pictures now. :'(
---
It may be a console issue then
---
&gt;If you are 200+, you will be ganked within 5 minutes of taking a workshop.
---
Oh, it's much less than 5 minutes. I've had players fast travel to me once I take a workshop for a daily in under one minute.
---
I killed him last night. He was legendary but didn't drop any🙁🙁
---
I ran into it for the first time this past week.  My brother and I are in the mid 60's, level wise, but we're the definition of casual-we don't farm Whitesprings, we've done the SBQ exactly once, and we just wander around having fun. (We have crap gear, is what I'm trying to say.  I have a two shot gatling gun, it does nothing else...)  His wife decided to start playing with us, and she was level 5 or 6 at the time.  Her and my brother were both overencumbered, so we decided to let her claim a workshop for the achievement, and to scrap junk so we could fast travel again.  It was going pretty well, until a level 35 guy showed up and started shooting.  We ignored him, so he started throwing grenades, just generally making a nuisance of himself.  The moment one of us had had enough and shot back to tell him to piss off, his level 153 friend that was hiding somewhere nearby came in and nuked us all with his TSE shotgun.  Hope my junk was worth ruining the game for a level 5 player who will probably never claim another workshop.
---
I knew it!  Thanks.
---
It’s become increasingly clear that the goal of these comments have shifted towards making me want to kill myself.  I don’t want to, but that’s clearly the goal here.  I’m right, you backwards savages push anything off a cliff that doesn’t come CORRECT AND MINDING YOUR SENSITIVITIES YOU FUCKING IDIOTS.  Also I clearly don’t give a shit about my past posts, which is why they are PUBLIC!  Please, make the volunteer fire-fighter/cancer survivor feel more worthless!  LETS GO
---
You know, Bethesda, this game, and the whole fallout franchise is great, but it seems like information like this, for example, should be a little bit more forthcoming. Especially for ‘tards like me. :)
---
I'd prefer if PvP people were kicked out to survival. Thats egocentric because I'm a good hunter and that means more prey for me, but also thats beneficial for experience and expectations of coop-minded people. I don't understand how its possible that invincible raiders doesn't bring you the joy that they do me, but I don't think my viewpoint is the only valid one, and we're all here to have fun.
---
While I don't necessarily want to get all political,  I will say that they seem to be running just about everyone they can find, so it wouldn't surprise me ;)
---
oh man im sorry to hear that, hopefully maybe tuesday they will make a fix??
---
Xbox 1 X
---
r/NoFaaaaaap your a dick.
---
Thanks for info!  
---
You and me both are hoping for awesome things with the Purveyor and maybe you’re right about him selling them.
---
First off, there's nothing wrong with your request to change the rewards/punishment mechanics. Your proposal is reasonable to me.  It doesn't matter what they end up with, 1/2 the people playing won't like it and want it changed again in some other way that benefits their play style.  A lot of players want Adventure to be a safe and fuzzy sandbox with only creatures to battle. That's fine. You know how the game was set up. My opinion of the game being more balanced now refers more to the fact that all players in Adventure can control their PVP experience on their terms, not someone else forcing it down their throats.  I know you have to know there is no more slap damage, so that's not even an issue except as slight annoyance when some asshat follows you around shooting you and all he can basically do is get in your way.  No matter what the rewards/punishment rate ends up being in Adventure, no one can farm me for caps unless I choose it by being willing to risk my workshop or chasing a bounty baiter, it's still my choice to be quick or dead.  This is way more balanced than it used to be.  That's all i was really saying
---
It's okay to be wrong
---
"Foolishly"?!?
---
No, because I (and many others) don't want our beloved PC games infested with the vile Pay To Cheat plague that has spread wide across the mobile gaming platform like a filthy nasty virus of greed.  
---
I won't intentionally purchase any games that I know to be selling "non cosmetic" "micro transaction" items, or any other type of cash for cheats/increased power/better weapons/"more storage space",etc...  
---
Fuck that.
---
Can't use any armor at all with the Garb of Mysteries. If you're skipping Garb of Mysteries might as well seek out standard armor with at least one piece chameleon and skip the chameleon mutation.
---
Why is there no mention here on the most sneak focused legendary armor mod there is?
---
As a side note, I  would like to see the legendary monsters become more deadly the higher ranked they are. Give them more DR, ranged attacks, etc.
---
Baaaa
---
Bethesda have replied to a post about it and have said should come in next update
---
Be prepared for it to randomly not work. Was in Morgantown last night with 14 agi, max sneak, 4 pieces of chameleon armor (one with extra sneak perk) and shielded raider underarmor for +3 agi. Everything in town knew where I was. I even sat inside a train car over on the west side of town, at night, in the shadows, motionless and invisible, but every time a scorched got close, I would instantly go to danger. I didn't care as they were no threat but I just shook my head at the absurdity of a lvl 6 scorched being able to detect me at all. Server hopped and the issue went away. If I had spawned in somewhere more dangerous I would have been ticked (and dead).
---
I always say to people, if you like fallout 4 you're going to like fo76. Don't know what all the fuss is about.
---
That would be a cool stat to see.
---
Finding limited items of worth seem to be the trend..,  it’s rather unfortunate to say the least
---
That is very similar to my build. I went the Chameleon armor route though, for when you can't sneak away. There is too much goodness available on Legendary Armors to not use any with the Garb. Also, with Sleek leg mods on the armor plus The Fixer, you almost move faster than just walking.
---
I did the Sheepquatch event last night, and was the pylon guy. Stayed in sneak the whole time and was never detected.
---
I'd suggest adding Covert Operative and or Sandman to help with damage.
---
Just curious, is The Fixer the only damage you will do, or will there be other guns/melee?
---
Damn.  This was my first experience where he just didn't ever become vulnerable.  I'm 50/50 at this point with the event.  As for some of my events, one of my groups beat him in like 5 minutes and one of my groups failed when he had a sliver of health left.
---
yup, unfortunately for me my friends bought into the hate and never even tried it. so unfortunately I wasn't able to play with them. 
---
my bro rented it and loved it, we played together a bit but he's broke so buying it isn't gonna happen. 
---
it's a great game, but it cranks up to 11 when you're playing with friends.
---
Not sure if you mean build your Camp, or if you meant it in the spawn camp sense, but I wouldn't build near the likely spots.  Some random encounters won't activate if there's a camp built nearby.
---
No there’s a mountain range in between the mire and the savage divide, I built in the northern area in a little depression at the mouth of a river, next to an abandoned free states bunker
---
My friend and I did the same right around when it launched and went on a decent sale and while we didn't mind the bugs, we both agreed that it was just far to difficult to try and do anything solo. I went back to try again with the last update and sadly I still feel the same, which honestly sucks.
---
Please keep us updated. I too have been influenced by my friends opinions
---
Workshops are a fairly useless game aspect. It's usually much easier to get resources just by adventuring and the PvP aspect keeps players away, too.
---
The fact that most, if not all, workshops are usually unclaimed on a server should be Bethesda's clue that workshops, as they are now, are a failure as game content. 
---
The lack of interesting things to do in this game is what keeps me from buying any more Atoms. I always feel like I'm two days away from quitting due to a lack of things to do.
---
Do you know mobile games like Clash Royale, etc., where they purposefully introduce frustrating delays, or you see your opponents making progress faster than you (because they purchase lots of "Chests", "Gems" etc.) and instead of making \*progress\* you find yourself falling behind?  That is a powerful set of motivating factors driving people to purchase these "Pay To Win" (terrible euphemism, please call it Pay To Cheat!).
---
Just having stats that show everything would be cool. 
---
-how many ghouls killed
---
-highest damage inflicted 
---
-amount of water consumed
---
-longest you stayed alive
---
-etc
---
Sadly no haha but we all know what we're hunting if Legendary Power Armor Pieces becomes real
---
By the way in FO4 there is a Sentinel Rank so you get a Sentinel Power Armor there
---
To be fair its easy to miss it, surprised Bethesda didn't just make it automatic upon opening  so it couldn't so easily exploited.
---
See? Its not so bad. It has its problems sure but so does every other game.
---
No, thats not what I said, nor is that what I meant.  
---
In a way, you are correct, I have weak defense... Other than PA, the individual pieces of the base armor I use are &lt; 50 DR, so it is in my best interest to take out enemies as quicky as possible.
---
example: WS golf club.  Lately, instead of being scattered in their respective rooms, all the bloated ones plus the Wendigo gather at the door and wait for you. Step in, and the swarm you.
---
I'm L57, melee w/ 15 strength and the associated perks.  I can solo that swarm  with a 1 hand non-legendary weapon.
---
Because I am in melee, I'm focused on swinging at the bloated ones that are trying their best to take me out, if another player shows up, I may (or may not) not even see them - 
---
Especially If they are hanging back (out of arms reach of the enemy) trying to tag with a silenced rifle, they are not in my line of sight; I  may not even know they are there (until they step in to check the bodies.)
---
Melee does not always provide the luxury of selecting only the legendary - In a mob, I usually discover which of the ghouls was the legendary after they are all dead .
---
If you have ever been swarmed by 10+ glowing ones simultaniously, you know exactly what I'm talking about.
---
OTOH, 
---
Something like fascnacht parade, different story.  
---
I switched to a rifle, and did exactly that, tag and move on. 
---
And yes, if I see and can get to a downed player, I will stimpak them.
---
Tuesdays are usually our main day so send me a message and I'll let you know!
---
Sometimes, but it (conveniently) seems to be when ive just finished grabbing loot and am encumbered. Ive tried dropping loot before, but the paperbag is below the surface (I guess, as I cant see it), so I end up losing that too. 
---
The other times there are enemies near by. Now im thinking about it, its almost always moles, so wondering if im glitching into a spawn point as they emerge??
---
Sadly no it's not real but if Beth finds this post sure we will have Sentinel Power Armor
---
Or we get a Sentinel Power Armor Paint Job instead straight from FO4
---
bahahahaha ultra cute. is it hello kitty themed?
---
Trolling is a noble cause. Keep it up.
---
Now you're playing with my heart. Legendary PA really needs to happen.
---
600 atoms rare
---
I seem to have a high chance of getting a 3 Star from him but nothing notable other than a Mole Miner Gauntlet with Furious/limb damage/weightless. Maybe it will keep Queen from flying again? idk 🤷‍♂️
---
Oh big time, always loved decorating my homes with a ton of BoS flags in FO4.
---
avoiding armor all together cause getting tired of repairing them.
---
This build is focusing around around that
---
As far as I know it’s a bug with the new update; I’m not 100% if you were on pc it could be something with the .ini files
---
Except we don’t have the big glowing circle on the map to know it’s been triggered nor a timer letting us know how much longer it’ll last.
---
Well then taking a step back I have to agree completely and represent the same approach when its survival thats considered. And by "world of slap damage", I also look at this from kinda different perspective. I dislike being called names and being unable to shoot the guy. To me slap damage means prevention from real damage, not the measly amounts of hp that was taken for first few months of the games existence, that disappeared in patch7 if Im correct. I dont necessarily shoot people on survival, but I just cant stand the game where I can't shoot people at will if they misbehave.
---
🤞
---
You shouldn't have to buy a full priced product to watch play through and read (non-paid) reviews and form an opinion. If you buy things blindly I would question you more than your buddy who has done research to dislike 76. I both live and hate it and got it for free so I'm in a minority lol
---
And if  you're desperate, there's a bunch at the first farm south of Vault 76 and just east of Morgantown Train Station.
---
Power to ya if you're liking it. If you the game, good. I'm still kinda iffy on the game. Personally, after putting hours into the beta and in the release, I just stopped having fun and saw it as a slog. (I'll have to see if I can still pull up my playtime later today). But I left early on, who knows, maybe the game has improved from when I played. Haven't really kept up.
---
r/zharkul76 is right. I rebuilt specifically to kill every and all builds lol. No one is untouchable with critikills. With perks and a couple of decent vats rifles your set. One shot all but the scorched queen herself.
---
Agreed
---
It took me years to stop playing shitty sports (non racing) games that never improved. It's like am addiction or the only thing available so you just swallow it and keep going.
---
I think the event is where it needs to be, expensive and hard, you need a team and some tanks to do it
---
yes there are other guns but thats when I don't need to sneak or hide
---
Honestly, the player interactions in this game are so good. 90% of people are friendly, helpful, and I love discovering people's camps and exploring them (even leaving little gifts for them as well).
---
This game is flawed, and can get a bit boring sometimes. But I like games like this and No Man's Sky. It's more of a "fun" bored.
---
The messenger drives me crazy. Whats sucks is no matter what you do, he wont budge. His health goes to 0, then back up 1/4 of the way, then down to 0, all the while hes powering up and down, like a bird flapping its wings lol
---
That’s an interesting point.  Currently I have 5
---
Maybe I’ll boost it and try a run on legendary creatures and see how it pans out.
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
I have never really built outside of the mire so that sounds very interesting
---
Nerds rule the world!
---
Form what I've noticed.  It's pretty hard if you are not well equipped with a team that knows what they are doing.   And yah it's fairly expensive for one person.   But the loot from what I've experienced is never EVER 2* or less.  It's always bean 3* for me and I've done it probably 9 times
---
And there is a slight chance that a legendary colonel gutsy will spawn
---
You bought the game last night and think it's good, that in itself is funny
---
Oh didn't think of that, yea if someone wants to pvp then sent to survival where they can't exploit the current poorly constructed pvp system like a COD server where all the hackers and exploiters are sent. Personally had nothing but bad experience in pvp, did 20 runs in events for legendary weekly weapon Sole Surivovor and it was so horrible, me and 8 other players went to do Uranium Fever but 4 other players were there and murder everyone not on their team and made us wait outside instead of doing event.
---
Seems like your shitter is full
---
When you say the crit cards, what combos do you use? I gotta move more to luck but I have better crits and 1 of 4 leaf, I'm assuming you add more rank to those?
---
Oh, thanks, I thought I read it somewhere and I thought it only goes to 50 in the challenges - then you might get more doubles later in game, of course.
---
I'm not gonna let a greifer live over the possibility of losing 170 caps
---
don't want to waste time to repair armor and Garb doesn't let you can't put armor on.
---
Looks like a Gene spliced nightmare that crawled out of the Big MT... Notgoing to lie, would love it in the game.
---
Oh shit, sorry. Yeah I ran from them at level 30.
---
I was a little upset for all of around 5 minutes until the new server just starting giving up the goodies after that I couldn't have been happier
---
Welcome to a group of fellow free-thinking individuals who are enjoying a game that a lot of others would if they gave it a chance
---
Yes! I will follow suit.
---
That's the crazy thing- I have literally dozens of junk-ass 3\* weapons from rolling pins to gatling lasers just sitting in my stash and my two go-to weapons are a 1\* instigating sniper rifle and a 1\* anti-armor lever rifle. Sure there's a 3\* furious exploding shotgun and the 3\* suppressors gatling gun that I sometimes find useful. But I get the most mileage from the simple 1\*'s.
---
Had her do her teleportation trick. Didn’t teleport back for 3 minutes. Ran around with our thumbs up our asses looking for her until there was 45 seconds left and teleported back
---
I've done it twice and both have been completed runs, albeit with a distinct lack of teamwork. It really blows my mind people don't use the pylons as it actually prompts you to use them.
---
I definitely think the asking price and crafting components are abit much and we will see the event dry up massively very quickly as people are not incentivised enough. Having a better reward system/ pool would be great as the ammo and chem sink is pretty dramatic to maybe get and instigating switch blade or nocturnal wood armour piece. 
---
And yes, I think the timer is a wierd decision but the problem is worse now as its release week fever. Give it a week or two and I predict it won't be a huge issue. 
---
It's a shame as I really enjoy it, I don't think it's unfair or overly difficult and would like to see more events like it.
---
Haha so original but yes it is
---
You're welcome.
---
Yell Heas! wate... sumptin' ron hear..
---
Well I meant my first impression of it lol
---
At 60$ you’ll get your moneys worth, yes there are glitches yes there will be moments you want to throw your remote/keyboard when it crashes during an sbq fight however Bethesda is making a continued effort to fix repair and bring new content to the game
---
I will come visit your bar if you visit mine.
---
Yes i know. I remember when this happened i went to do another quest with a robot involved. Guess what, it got stuck too. The only solution to this is not to do messenger quests anymore, they suck anyway.
---
You might as well have come to a place that was a warzone for last 20 minutes and now the event started trolling the respawn for the fighters :)
---
I dont think people should be "exiled" to survival. I just think means to execute violence should only be provided on survival.
---
There's a firecracker whisky?!
---
Any updated methods since the vendor cap limit increase. I only set my camps at junk deposits and bundle excess valuable junk in bulk. Kind of a passive farm that accumulates over time. I'd love to hear if someone has a better strategy
---
“Event radio” would be a cool station to tune in to when you’re not questing or doing supply runs that just repeats active event timers and announces event starts and endings.
---
Better crits, Crit savvy, 4 leaf then all the rifle damage perks, bloody mess, nerd rage, Rifleman, ermm... Demo expert for Explosive, off the top of my head but I'd have to go look. I have rifles with +50% crit shot and so on to, so I'm doing a hell of a lot of damage with each shot. There's the perk card that makes it so you can fire 2-3 crit shots as well.
---
I'd be more than happy to share my build in a screenshot, unfortunately I'm not online but later I will send you a pic. Although I switch cards on survival and adventure mode.
---
The cost to run it multiple times is a bit high in my opinion but the event itself doesn't need to be changed.  It's a difficult event that requires team work.  Even if you play solo, you still play a role.
---
I own this game on PS4 and a PC (980ti Hybrid, i5 9600K, 16GB RAM, 4K 55" TV) and I can't say much about the connection difference between PS4 &amp; PC but I can tell you that in my experience, playing the game on my PC is WAY more pleasurable, hands down. I'm getting so that I don't even play (FO76) on PS4 now because everything is so much slower.

That makes sense, however I believe it doesn't calculate the items until we select the "box" anyways, hence seeing the spinning wheel for a brief moment before they load sometimes. My thoughts would be have our accounts tagged as a 1 for normal or 2 for normal + perk(s) pool etc. Wishful thinking I guess, I still enjoy the game regardless, just a "quality of life" headache. Kind of like having to cooonstantly swap out perk cards just to lockpick... I really hope they eventually revamp how they've done some of the cards in a future patch.
---
Then I'd suggest focusing some in luck...Better Criticals makes clearing an area that much quicker. If you're a VATS person (like me) Gun Fu plus Grim Reaper and Four Leaf and The Fixer...you can clear the ghouls in the Whitesprings Clubhouse in a couple of minutes.
---
Also, mutations wise...Marsupial helps you escape quickly when things go south.
---
How much did bethesda paid u to write this
---
Agree. Don't fix anything. Everything is working great for me so everything is great.
---
It was found at grafton steel. It's in a small building with half a brick wall missing towards the back area of the main building packed with super mutants, there is an armor workbench inside the building with some lockers next too it the plan was sat on one of the shelves of the open lockers. I have picked up armor plans here before but not a bos plan until now. It is a guaranteed armor spawn plan point, so if it's not the one your looking for dont pick it up and server hop till you find the right one.
---
Yeah that's what I had in mind going to get it. Whats the worst it can do? Might as Well give it a chance
---
I dunno, I started running my full leather gear and I feel a noticable slow down as a conduit. Still prefer to have fast stimpaks on as fighting the tick is a bitch, but yeah, with leather gear I could actually keep the health up tick positive with a bit of maintenance. 
---
Conduit tanking by simply marsupial jumping and hitting H and 1 for water semi consistently. Even have time to do a majority dps.
---
Kinda really glad I had a design handicap in that I only wanted leather vault painted stuff. Weeee me!
---
It's better than it was. It was difficult to play at first without crashes and serious frame rate issues. There were also a lot more bugs hindering gameplay back then too. It's still a tad buggy now but I can usually play it without crashing or having to force-kill the game (happened to me a lot within the first few weeks).
---
I like this game a lot, and I'm really hopeful that it keeps improving over time.
---
100 bottlecaps
---
Liberty Prime hated that.
---
I’d be fine with it if it had a 1-hour cool down, rather than 3 hours. My friends and I have plenty of flux and caps to do the event a few times each night. It’s just a pain to get your whole team into a session where you can start the event, as someone inevitably gets a “world full” message.
---
Sure you are. Have fun...
---
Yeah it's getting old fast ;)
---
XBOX user. Can confirm. Please fix :D
---
Spent an hour jumping across the map to get the Nuka quantum paint for my stream last night, go to show the viewers the paint job, can’t mod it /awkward
---
all just so expertly done .
---
I'm glad you got in.  The damn cooldown at three hours is a stupid, but I was able to actually finish the main quest, and join  events  without using my free card.  One was successful and cooperative, one flustercluck. Good luck!
---
I really wish they would have made it only take up the one side if the menu instead of making me close it.
---
We had to send a friend request to one of the hosts and join them that way. Thankfully the server they were on was not very full with other people.
---
if you already own it then there's nothing at all stopping you from trying it for a day or a week. The real question is: Is it worth playing for you? 
---
Only you can answer this one.
---
I dont think it's too hard or expensive. It's definitely too broken. I joined the event and died within a couple seconds. After that every time I respawned, the enemies were not visibly loaded in, so I died about 6 times without chance to see the enemies. Then my game crashed. I was lucky enough to load back in on a random player and still hit the boss for loot. The event is good but the glitches are absolutely trash. No fairness whatsoever.
---
That sounds damn fun! I always liked changing the fire type to "Liberty Prime Laser" and adding the big clip and any mod that covered it in electronics. I was RPing Kaneda from Akira and having a bigass shoulder mounted laser felt damn great.
---
When i encounter something like that i just jump servers.
---
As people begin to understand what you are supposed to do, it will become easier. If you have a group all decked out in sheep gear show up, you can almost guarantee a win because they have been farming the event and get it.
---
My reply ty.
---
I agree there's a benefit to the player, but the way that we have to go about it is not beneficial to us, more a headache in the design.
---
Hasn’t changed form when you last played it. Still the same stability issues with some new content. Keep waiting and keep our servers clear for us that still play the game.
---
Ya.  What mods say they contain and what you actually get are very different.   Has been like that for quite some time.
---
Kinda funny that the scorchbeast is more effective than nukes.
---
That makes a lot of sense when you put it that way! Thanks man! 
---
See, I was also under the impression that you needed to have all three in heavy gunner to unlock expert and so on. Found out that you get them regardless.
---
Yes absolutely. Pre-xp nerfs getting to level 50 was a solid 50 hours of play and unless you were speed running that's about how long it would take to beat the main mission. 
---
50 hours of gameplay is a solid game, and even after the main quest there was still plenty of content if you wanted to check out some side quests and do some exploring. 
---
They've made some stability and QoL improvements, added a couple new quests, but Fallout 76 was never a bad game.
---
In my experience they flash red all the time you just have to get lucky enough to have it work when you try to activate the event
---
Nah we good. No character out there. No heart.
---
Did the quest last night and had avoided spoilers  before. It was so much fun , we kept dying and spent heaps of stimpacks. Just what we needed as the game started to be too easy for high levels with decent gear. I like the rewards too , just som light items ( Fedora ) to keep as a memory of this quest. I guess we were a little lucky as experienced players came to our aid and we managed to get that assultron to the ground. I think this was the most fun i have had in this game ! One time a player came to reviwe me with a stimpack , and he died while sawing my life :-)
---
I’ve bought it off some people and they usually all price it around 125 caps
---
I think the value on the item is like 125.  I got it for completing my first event yesterday.
---
Thanks guys. I've always been into storylines more than the actual game. A good storyline is what draws me into a game more than anything else, so it's nice to know a little bit of the history. Unless 1, 2, and NV come to Xbox One anytime soon, I probably won't get to play those. I will have to go back and finish 3 sometime. I'm playing 4 now and am already noticing some similarities to 76 as well as some major differences. The one major difference is the whole scrapping and building mechanics. I keep finding myself wanting to scrap the junk when all you have to do is store it in the workshop, so that'll take some getting used to. The only thing I hate about it so far is not being able to pick up your power armor and carry it with you when you don't wanna wear it. I also now see why people want to be able to snap CAMP's together in 76 as you literally get to rebuild a community in 4, which rebuilding the country is what the series promotes alot, and it seems Betheda has forgotten that with 76.
---
Have they said other maps locations like this are confirmed?
---
I like that, obviously everyone else liked it over me too as I'm getting downvoted for honesty.
---
OK cool, been a while since I was that short on mats, and never tried to keep track when scrapping those before.  Glad to know it's not just me being dense ;-)
---
Only if they let us build C.A.M.Ps and build on freeways
---
A recent update made it so other plYs dont do any damage to you unless you fight back. I think it was a good change for anyone starting off the game fresh.
---
Yeah I'm a big fan of this statue. Glad I dropped the atoms on it.
---
One challenge that is outright stupid is exploring Appalachia for 7600 hours, you get a grand total of 20 atoms.
---
I believe the camera would only capture in game content. Nothing particularly lewd.
---
I got tired of people telling me it's going to be trash and not to buy it but I'm a blind Fallout fanboy with my own opinion so I got it right away as preorder. 442 hours though. 😗
---
I believe the Sacrificial blade mod only adds the legendary effect of Bleeding and poison damage to the machete, while doing the same damage as a serrated one. I believe that's how it is.
---
If you're on console (which most people are), you can go to any Redbox and rent it for $3. Someone's allowed to not buy something based on reviews, but their opinion is less than worthless unless they actually played the game. It's like going on Amazon and leaving reviews for something you've never owned or used.
---
GT: Driveinkiller
---
Are you in tonight? I can make you a full set of armor and give you a couple hundred purified waters if you're interested :)
---
Is the arena still happening?
---
I like the episodic holotapes. Who goes there is fun.
---
Thanks, dude, but I’m on PS4. :-)
---
have any sets left
---
Even when it had its bugs they weren’t as bad as everyone made it out to be. I think people just like to circle jerk negativity these days. I’ll hit you up when I’m on. Would love to explore with you and help you out with any aid, resources, ammo, etc you might need!
---
They "fixed" something, so you know it's gotta go badly. They can't seem to do anything by half measures... "Oh, you don't want high level characters to be screwed? Fine, you get next to nothing!" "You think two shot explosive weapons are OP? They do 1/5th the damage now, happy???" It's like there's some fucking child in a basement throwing tantrums every time he reads complaints about balance issues and just flips his shit, and, every single time, makes shit worse.
---
This right here is probably the best answer I have ever seen. Like the person above me said nobodies opinion on this sub really matter. Like I can tell you until I am blue in the face that the game runs great but someone else can tell you its shite. Neither of us is really wrong persee it's all what someone has experienced and the level of stuff your willing to live with. Some people have very high standards that are almost impossible to live up to and others are at the other end and have absolutely no standards. I'll see this yes the game still has some issue and depending how far you progressed previously there is a lithe more content. If you looking for content I would say maybe wait or get ready for the burrows dlc update it's supposedly going to add more content. But again that's only my opinion. Take it for what it is.
---
Thank you, pal, but I’m on PS4.
---
It is, and apparently not very widespread. my biggest concern is that Bethesda may not put enough resources to fix this, a.k.a. bother to.
---
I see people selling those for thousands wtf
---
Mate in all honesty I'll give you half of my shit cos I barely play it
---
Eh it dropped some .50 Cal ammo and some Fusion Cells for me last night, the drops from it are crappy as it is
---
Aww still just as good, in other only forced pvp should be in survival which is still a solid argument.
---

It doesn't have any effect on your perk load out.  It's more like a semi-permanent chem effect.  You don't gain extra space for cards but you don't lose any either.  It will effect carry capacity, ap, hp, exp, and so on but it dosen't change the base stats or the number of points you have for perks.
---
Thank you, Jester, but I’m on PS4.
---
Hey sounds good! Might not be on tonight but hope to see you soon in the wastes lol
---
Seems like most combats would be resolved before help could arrive from further than emote range. There's the standard "HELP" emote for that (the one with the panicked looking Vault Boy waving his arms in the air), at least.
---
Every so often, someone suggests the social solution of using the flare gun to call for help at somewhat longer ranges.  Doesn't seem to have caught on, though.  I suppose interested/curious players might come to check the source of a flare in any case. (I know I tend to take a long-distance peak at any extended combat noises, in any case.) May be a bit awkward to do while fighting for your life and/or hiding from an SB, though.
---
Doubt they will fix it tbh. At this point I’m considering a lawsuit. Way too many promised and advertised things, very little to no things delivered. Aka false advertising
---
I’ll most likely be on tomorrow too! Gotta get my weekend caps! See you then 🤙🏼
---
Yeah I might be able to hop on tonight, domt know for sure
---
Perfect.
---
disease rate is awful tbh
---
Lmao
---
Beer keg is from a weekly challenge that they haven't released yet. I'm not sure about the poster but I'll check
---
From what I've found, if its -2STR then it should just reduce carrying capacity and melee damage I believe. I'm pretty certain it doesn't affect perk cards for that category
---
that’s true, i’m sure they could pull something off though.
---
I think the hits don't register very well in general. Many times I'd be swinging right up on an enemy and wouldn't connect until the 3rd hit on average. 
---
Then patch hit, I couldn't hit *anything* from 3rd person unless I was in PA. 
---
Updated my custom.ini and it at least got it back to how it was pre-patch. Running unyielding gear I don't want to be forced into PA, and I prefer 3rd person for melee.
---
You can check this [guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b7oyri/comprehensive_power_armor_and_mods_guide/?st=JU89DRLJ&amp;sh=b40fefb4) for more information about pa’s and mods
---
True.
---
Hmm yeah weird. I've been getting stuck between furniture like tables, chairs, walls. Rocks too. But I just spam jump until I'm out. Sounds like yours is a completely different issue though so hopefully it gets fixed.
---
All good man! I'm on weekends after 10. I have a camp with everything and can make you full heavy leather armor. What lvl are ya ? I'm only lvl 31 but have a lvl 5 as well.
---
Likewise. Inert flux is my go-to drink
---
I don’t think a lawsuit is the choice. Sometimes its better to take it easy
---
The demand kind of died out so I figured I'd try something new. I'll probably rebuild the arena in a couple weeks and we'll just switch back and forth
---
Haha yes... I leave for work in the morning usually before any of my family is awake, so I get up a bit early and have a cup of coffee and do a bit of farming. It's a nice way to get the brain working in the morning.  At night I generally have to fight with my son for the XBox, but since it was originally his Christmas present I defer to him and let him Fortnite with his buddies.
---
Ultra Cute skin better become a thing.  Better be fabulous. And the description better say "Tatermater05 approved."
---
I always take reviews with a grain of salt. Make sure there is a decent return policy. Decide for  myself.
---
It has its bugs, like all other Bethesda games, but it is spectacular.
---
Everyone hating on the lack of npc's makes it sound like fo76 is an unengaging, desolate, and terrible environment. I love rummaging around and discovering what happened.
---
Idk. I love fo76. Im happy you do too.
---
Oh huh I guess u got lucky then :)
---
The handmade is a great gun with the low recoil and fast firingspeed + its good fun to scrap and learn new mods for it. Just try and see if you like it. Rifle  perks for semi auto and commando for auto. I reccomend the first because it saves ammo which can be a bit scarse at your level ?!
---
Yessssssss that’s perfect I would instantly buy it
---
So I'm kinda bitter. I keep reading you're supposed to get a "free recall card"...I never did.
---
Yup. The other nice thing about doing it this way is it makes you more flexible as a heavy gunner. You can throw on a rifle or something else and still get some additional damaged out of it.
---
Thanks for the tips, pal. I will try them.
---
Remember the nylon bags? They didn’t care until a big group of people started organizing class action lawsuit
---
Too bad for the Tales of WV tapes the subtitles are just [Radio Drama Plays]...
---
50 characters among all items
---
It also doesn’t seem to be able to drop below 1. My one character has mutations that would give -8 to Str, but she only had Str 1 and hasn’t raised it so it can’t put her below that. Chems that would give a strength boost don’t work on her though. Doesn’t seem to affect perk card slots at all.
---
I like hearing about characters like him, the survivalist, Ulysses Pelinal Whitestrake from Elder Scrolls etc. Characters who are best described as “The NPC who was basically another Player” it makes my god like end game character seem less out of place and less odd, knowing there are others on his level.
---
It shoots out the brown bags, didn’t think about that one did you
---
they are amazing..yes this is a good idea..im a rifle build..i switch between levers and handmades
---
My sister bought the game at launch, and I wasn't very interested, even though I am a longtime fallout fan. I borrowed her copy and instantly got hooked. After a few weeks she wanted it back so I went to gamestop to get my own copy. I mistakenly ask the cashier if they have any used copies of FO4, and he says yeah. When I realize my mistake and ask for 76, his attitude totally changes and he tells me i don't want that game. He tells me there's no story at all. He tells me that people can nuke your camp at any time with no way to repair and a bunch of other untrue bs. I told him I actually love the game and this is kind of my second copy. He still talked me out of the sale, but only because they only took 5 bucks for a used copy. Got it new at walmart across the street for $20 cheaper. I went back in a few weeks later to get the prima guide for like 12 bucks, but I think that's the last time i'm going to gamestop. Totally unprofessional.
---
In cranberry bog, near the quarry I’ll see mirelurks near the fissure site. 
---
For giggles, I try to pull agg and draw the SB, to the mirelurks when possible
---
Nothing wrong with that. My main is a two shot handmade with no other bonuses and until I got Sole Survivor last night I was using a tricked out no legendary lever gun. My heavy damage gun was a stalkers Dragon but it takes so long to load that I stashed it. I'm sitting on a ton of nice 3 stars waiting to cash them in because they dont suit my style. I do have a *3 switchblade I named "Oyster Shucker" that deals extra damage to mirelurks, does bonus limb damage and weighs less. I just carry it for fun. If youre on xbox and feel like checking out each others legendaries I'm down.
---
Yes! You have to do it. To just relax but get going
---
Good parenting though with the sacrifice
---
Dailys should not be hard and complicated, if You do them all its top 50-60 points, thats not much. Weekly or character, survival etc based events could be more complicated, not impossible though, but that comes with higher points value per one challange. I dont know if I will bother with doing them at all if they will be pain in the ass
---
I really didnt enjoy the multiplayer aspect but I absolutely loved the setting and exploring the world.
---
10/10 would read and agree and up vote again.
---
I don't do PVP...and I still think the bag system needs an over-haul. Your shit needs to be marked with your name, and if someone else grabs shit out of it, they need to get tagged for PVP.   
---
I don't understand why bethesda didn't do that, they're pushing PVP down our throats left right and center, but some sack of shit can walk up, steal all your shit if you drop everything from a farming run to do one of their stupidly rare end game events, with zero consequences?  
---
Whoever made that decision is a fucking \_dick\_.
---
You should not have to give money to Bethesda to have an opinion on their products. I've bought Skyrim 4 times does that give me 4 times the opinion lol
---
I'm just saying, for example, I stopped playing (non racing) sports games 5 years ago because they were doing the exact same anti consumer practices you see companies starting to do now. Just because I don't buy the new madden or new fifa doesn't mean my opinion on how they rip people off isn't any less valid. 
---
I've never owned a jeep wrangler or a Toyota hilander but I still know they are unsafe at turning sharp angles because I was shown this through other peoples work. You do not need to physically experience something to have an opinion especially when it costs money to experience that thing. 
---
I also like 76 I'm just saying there's a lot of things wrong with this product and I would not have bought it if it wasn't game shared for free. And Tbh my opinion hadn't changed much (I cancelled my own preorder)
---
I meant actually the items not characters! Sorry for the confusion.
---
I like the idea of flat 100 caps in survival.
---
I got the horses in the back.
---
I thought that unless you are in the top 3 you don't appear in survival? 
---
And if you are in the top 3 you are specifically marked on the map.
---
Do I have that wrong?
---
Someone posted it yesterday.
---
Wow! Explosions!! Who wouldn't want to buy this??
---
Yeah i love the way it all looks.
---
...just put a bullet in the damn thing??
---
This is incredible! Thank you for sharing!

 &gt; This is incredible! Thank you for sharing!
---
I meant characters as in numbers/letters/etc. Not characters you play. You can have a total of 50 characters (letters/numbers) amongst all items in your possession
---
Crouching does not increase your speed. It costs you   AP.
---
I play pretty casually and that's what I use (level 38). Have to build/scrap a bunch of them for the good mods, but I got most of the best mods pretty quickly (e.g. perforating magazine, hardened receiver, suppressor, etc.). I don't have mad skills or anything, so the lack of recoil, excellent accuracy, and high durability really help out a lot. I also just got a couple of levels of Tank Killer, and I was really impressed by how well that was working against enemies. It does eat through ammo, but Ammosmith took care of that (obviously can't get Super Duper yet).
---
All of this.  Having a balcony cantilevered by 10 ft just doesn't sit right with me.  They need columns to look right, but you can't evenly space them. 
---
I was at least lucky enough to get my conduit to work the way I wanted it to.
---
That seems...woefully limited.
---
Pfff, everypony knows sonic rainbooms are just a made-up story...
---
Thanks for your report! We're aware of this issue and currently investigating.
---
I haven't done this event yet. So I'm glad to know these tips ahead of time. How do I know if the server is on cool down? From the terminal on site?
---
I enjoy it as well. Only level 25, I try to play at night when my boy goes to bed. Fun game, it's the typical fallout world. I do wish there were human interaction. Makes the world feel lonely just seeing corpses. Overall the last patch(s) fixed a good chunk of issues. At least they are listening to users. The repair kit debacle I'm just not sure on it because I don't ever buy anything in game no matter what. Especially after I pay for the game. None the less I enjoy the game for what it is.
---
Will it actually go on the atom shop
---
They look like a low spot or a hole in the ground you can sometimes pick up or take from. Visit just about any workshop, claim it, and open the build mode. Switch to the Resources tab and read through the Extractors available for that location. Select one of them to build and walk around the location until it turns green and will let you build it. Without building come out of build mode and you will see exactly what that deposit looks like.
---
Poseidon is excellent for this as you can just walk around the fence and see 4 different ones in a minute. From the claim table, behind you in the road/driveway is concrete. To the right by the building is a fusion core processor (you cannot build this one, it'll be there when possible). Past the core processor at the next corner of the small transformer yard's fence is a lead deposit. On the other side of the vertibot pad is an aluminum deposit. Finally finishing this counterclockwise walk around the fence will lead you back to the gate at the entrance. There is a nuclear ore deposit.
---
In addition to workshops, there are hundreds of deposits scattered all over the map outside of named locations where you can build your camp to take advantage of them to produce materials at home.
---
I think its due to server space. A lot of players all renaming causes a lot of data to be rendered/processed. Wish it was more but *shrug*
---
Right on I'm level 6 or 7 right now
---
Thanks for your tips. I will try them. (I dont worry about the calendar time, I’m just said it to show that I’m not very good playing and thats why I spent all my stuff in those missions.)

---
 &gt; Thanks for your report! We're aware of this issue and currently investigating.
---
I wouldn't want them auto deleted but making them so I could store them in stash or drop them would be nice once the quest is complete.
---
I figured there was a character limit I just had no idea there was a limit to the amount of items that can be renamed!
---
I know. I have a lot of bad luck. :-/
---
Just for knowing what set of PA is which, worth it :p
---
Was sitting here wondering how much kb some text could take up compared to the rest of the stuff the game has to track.
---
You know I think people are making way too big of a deal about this. I dont think it really matters
---
Spawn camp sense.
---
But just ran around the northern mark in map for one day and one night, in the costume. Didn't see any cryptids.
---
Likewise to a player that way a way higher level than me helped me kill some mutants that were slaughtering my ass. He came along with a sledgehammer and took care of them like nothing. Then like most took off in to the wasteland. Thanks for saving me a death my fellow wonderer!
---
I don't run any mods and I'm whiffing in melee almost constantly. It seems to be an unarmed thing as I'm seeing a buddy swatting the bad guys with a super sledge just fine.
---
That was honestly the most fun in game I’ve had, and was thinking of changing my alts camp into an arena it’s got 4 levels but a few weeks from now is perfect, I’m in the middle of moving to Yellowknife so I’ve not much time to spend in game right now but I’ll keep in touch for updates on the next fight night
---
I’m on Ps4. Thank you.
---
It can be 1 item with 50 letters or 10 items with 5. Its just a server limit. Maybe it will go up in time. I want them to fix the lag spiking first though
---
Yes, dude; I’m on Ps4.
---
I have yet to see a rational argument on how the premium repair kits are that bad. Yeah I know they're not cosmetics, like the atom store was promised, bit the only rationale for the rage I have seen is "This is only the beginning, it's a stepping-stone to P2W items" which is an utterly and objectively absurd argument. I don't know if these people are actually paranoid or just trying to be Bethesda saboteurs (and, yeah, riding the karma train).
---
All I know is I fire up my PC, show up on my Brotherhood themed character in my power armor, point my anti-armor minigun at that sumbitch, and suddenly she wants to be my best friend. Ain't got no time for dem hugs, only time to give her 5mm slugs. So I sit on the roof and sexually identify as a turret.
---
Individually probably very little. Add that up over the total of all players... It can probably get pretty large.
---
Just gimme a hells yea and we’ll call it good
---
Ohhhh sorry I thought you meant marathoner, but from my experience power user is the only thing that makes it have a low drain
---
Feels like a gimme! Maybe it’s taking a lot of extra tooling.
---
Don’t play it. Huge issue rn where the game keeps freezing every 2-3 seconds literally making it unplayable. My 2 year old could make a better game than Bethesda ffs
---
Gotcha, thanks.
---
If they're legendary mirelurks, will they chitter in fear and run away? \*grin\*
---
Just keep trying, I have 50/50 luck depending who is at the event. A lot of people are not sure what to do, so just be patient .. some ones we successfully others we get trashed .. just make sure you keep turning on the pylons ... then trying to kill him ... don't bother with stimpacks, just die and come back and try again. I have probably passed 3 and failed 3..
---
well, they should fix the consoles. just leave PC alone since this one helped us.
---
Wait I have way more than 10 items with more than 5 characters. I have four loadouts, each with the following names "_____ assault rifle" "_____ knife" "_____ sniper rifle" "______ outfit" "______ mask" "______ helmet" "______ underarmor"
---
With ____ as a 5-6 character load out name
---
Also on PS4 and experiencing no noticeable differences.
---
I think it applies to the actual custom characters. Not the others. So if you change furious sniper rifle to angry sniper rifle than only the angry part counts
---
Oh, you meant mods to the game? No, I'm on PS4 with nothing modified other than a few in game settings. AFAIK there are no mods for consoles?
---
Welcome! You are me from 3 weeks ago - I'm still playing and loving it. I think this game is going to follow a similar trajectory to Sea of Thieves/No Mans Sky, where the initial release isn't quite what people wanted but incremental updates shape it into a lasting classic.
---
The only disadvantage to a rifle build is as yet there are no weight reduction perks for that class. I still run a rifleman/stealth sniper build along side my heavy weapons/PA build. It does mean swapping a lot of perks out to switch between them though.
---
(Still hoping for Bethesda to add the facility to save separate perk load out decks.)
---
The rifleman/sniper build is by far my favourite play style, I mostly play as heavy because for the average weight of a rifle I can carry an lmg, .50 machine gun, auto grenade launcher and a minigun with weight left for a melee weapon to save on ammo.
---
There’s a legendary mirelurk queen but since the SB Flies and spits acid, the queen usually loses.
---
To make it fair, I’ll kill the robots or muties or scorched attacking her.
---
Postcard collage comes under the same tab as the Nukashine House party poster and Sheepsquatch one. My guess is that it will be another free poster in the atomic shop next week for the Burrows under Harpers ferry as the collage seems to feature only locations in the mire.
---
Wait 6 years it will be  $4 at Game Stop if they are still around.
---
You can preview it in the game itself in the build menu for your camp. You'll be able to see it actual size there, iirc
---
I got it about quarter way down before it decided it was going to stay out of VATS range and just strafe with its poison spray move from space.
---
Hitting flying shit free-aim with a Gatling is.. rough. Maybe I ought not be using it, but I found it and it was fun, lol. It cared not for my Combat Rifle; I hit entire clips worth and it didn't hardly move the health bar.
---
Death is a preferable alternative to Communism.
---
I tried to get other friends to get it and they will not touch it
---
This post is a nice break from the "Hey Bethesda" posts, but this guy could also be cashing in on easy Karma, not sure what to believe.
---
I’m level 107 and I’ve crafted 2 so far idk I enjoy the event and it’s easier to do than the sbq especially cause you can reasonably do this event with 3 level 60s with a good build
---
TBH noone knows for sure yet. And I have seen some stating they did more after the emergency  maintainence. I only renamed my PA so not totally sure
---
In Russia, his followers refer to Him as the Holy Moley,
---
I did the same, for the most part. But now the challenges are a little too challenging, and I only need to make one vendor stop to max out on caps. I'm going to need a new routine... Maybe I should just hunt for legendaries that suck or don't fit in my stash, haha.
---
I used to get four or five of the dailies routinely, but since the patch it's more like two. Too many of them are not things you can accomplish by effort, but things that have to happen to you by chance. Rad storms? Legendaries at fissures? Good luck.
---
Yeah, though the would fix this in their ‘hot fix’ they just had, but I guess not
---
Whether they do or don't, I wish they'd add another way to get acid. I go through it SO quick making ammo and refining ores. Or maybe this won't matter when player vendor stalls arrive, which is hopefully very soon.
---
I unlocked the targeting computer by breaking missile launchers down... If you can't find the plans keep doing that... If your on ps4 I can put it on for you
---
Hmmmm where have I seen this before 🙄🙄🙄
---
Sounds like you both got what you wanted
---
271. Definitely got my moneys worth.
---
You only appear on the map if you are in the top three and -not- crouched. 
---
Crouching still hides your marker, unless they changed that in the last update, its why you often can't see any of the top three on the map. Since I don't want to kill myself every time i'm in the top three, I have to say crouched whilst hunting people, so the faster move speed from that, in additon to speed demon and that cha perk will help.
---
all the time for me.  I have to exit the bench and come back to see the left window details.
---
Really???
---
A lot. That warehouse on legs might be running a carry weight over 600! You should always wait and see what falls off the back of that truck.
---
Check the terminal inside the shack. If it’s ready it’ll just say access denied keycard required. If it’s recharging it’ll tell you to come back later (even if you don’t have a keycard).
---
This is amazing how did you cram him in there like that?? I usually have to segment them.
---
Right... Except you can look at the location in those pictures and get a pretty decent idea of scale.
---
Its was mate. You are now at legendary status

Tbh I posted this bc I believed the people that had hate for this game(nothing against them) and I got tired of being told not to buy the game so then I just did it. Came here to express my opinion of my experience. I totally did not expect this to go as far as it has lol
---
what is the purpose
---
Player vending will be tied to your stash just like fermenting is
---
I have my TSE Handmade renamed ".STRELOK ASSAULT RIFLE" and my Instigating Handmade renamed ".STRELOK SNIPER RIFLE", with all of my weapons and outfits? Over four different load outs which I'm guessing is a shit ton of custom characters because the only weapons I have are TSE and Instigating rifles that don't include the word sniper or assault.
---
Oh man old post!
---
They were actually a serious annoyance, haha.
---
If you look at the pictures, you can see that my "garage" level had grated "2nd floor" as roofing in certain places. Along with it being for "design" for letting more light in, its real function was keeping a sight line open for my single turret I often kept. The turret sat exactly one "2 square 2nd floor" piece to the right of the right-most wall when walking in the main opening. This gave it \~a square back of sight to sit RIGHT where an enemy ALWAYS liked to get tangled in my base when I'd zone in. When fast traveling to my CAMP for the first time in a play session or after a server switch, I'd usually go Rambo around the base to clean out any issues. I'd get an occasional relatively non-confrontational until hit crab on the "trash can" entrance side, the consistent main spawn point, and occasional "assaults" coming up from the hill to the West.
---
At first I honestly thought I'd need 1-2 turrets for whatever my final iteration ended up being with it being an ACTUAL spawn point. 
---
Over time though I found even having them non-essential. Once the base got a lot more compact, I got harassed a lot less. For example, I literally spent a few hours semi-intentionally testing how high the surrounding enemies allowed walls to get before they aggroed. First obstacle was the spawn in at the half buried church across the way. Once I'd functionally hid my base below sight line level with their natural range from the base, I never had to fight them once unless it was intentional, which it usually was as there were frogs/chickens and usually some other free loot for occasional clutch scrap. That's how I ended up with the 2nd floor as my roofing for the main structure, as bad guys can very clearly see and reaaaallly don't like roof placements. 
---
Then it just took finally bringing all of my crops inside the structure to eradicate the occasional "assault up the hill" group of enemies that enjoyed occasionally spawning while I putzed around the CAMP. Pulling in my original field of Razorgrain and original Windmill power setup (before I wedged the fusion generator down below) had them no longer attacking unless I popped my face over that ridge, which simply didn't happen unless I was intentionally running the perimeter. 
---
Even eventually realized that the trash can mirelurk didn't attack my walls until I ended up in sight lines on the far side of my base, or a tamed animal was automatically in combat with it whenever I'd load in. 
---
So what it ended up coming down to was consistently dealing with the static spawn functionally right inside my base. I'd keep a heavy laser turret handy in the aforementioned turret location that would turn ghouls or bloodbugs to dust by the time I hopped down to clear up. Didn't always fare as well against a Super Mutant + Hound, but it kept them distracted from stuff like my Rad arch for me to always have an easy time cleaning up.
---
By the end of my time there, the turret was gone and I'd just immediately clean up where I'd know the spawns would be. 90% of the time nothing of importance would be damaged to any real degree. I had my Rad arch in the semi open since I moved there, with it getting down to like 10% health at the VERY start before I learned that Scorchbeasts really prefer lowwwwww walls. Literally never got destroyed once by the spawn ins for a *month and a half* of me calling this location home.
---
Part of that was likely because at the time, *no one but me* was ever in the area when on a server. Once I cleared out the initial pack of enemies, I was usually home free until I server hopped or something. Almost never dealt with someone running by causing the in house enemies to ransack the place. It happened occasionally, I'd find a plant and a wall taken out, but nothing difficult to repair in a few seconds. Either visitors helped kill things at decent intervals, or the server spawning them at the base doesn't keep them active long if someone is passing by but not really visiting. 
---
Things might be different now. At the time of my posting this, popular locations weren't really established. I went from never once having the "your CAMP couldn't be placed" with a grand total of TWO visitors since I'd started the build (you see why I had to make a post about it, it got lonely, lol). , to 1/3 logins not being able to be placed with people adding it to their walk through routes of the Mire.
---
Not sure how it is months later, but whatever its like, the mileage will definitely vary from when I made this OG post.
---
If you have any questions and are on PC I can hop over and explain/help if you end up at this location for another shot. Weirdly have the stubborn pylon terrain more or less memorized, so I'm pretty good with fixing it up lol.
---
u/ TobiasWidower
---
CRIME: Did not mention the Forged.
---
SENTENCE: Fed to forge.
---
Yeah there are AGL perks I think that can reduce AP cost while crouched or stealth.
---
They’re stealth focused
---
Lmao ok
---
Wasn't my mine but I'm sure they will be eventually
---
They could make it just shoot steel scrap that explodes on impact.
---
You should take a pylon and stand on top of that instead. You get 25% more damage output and being on top of one in the middle you will take no damage from the conduit
---
Is sea of thieves better? I played it when it first came out and quickly got tired of the constant boring grind lol
---
I would love to spectate this kind of thing.
---
How about some level 15 pipe guns?
---
Yeah, it's getting kinda annoying for me already when it pops up every time I launch the game regardless if there's anything new or not.
---
Solid 331 hours so far since BETA.
---
Sage advice. 
---
A large structure as part of your CAMP is expensive to relocate. 
---
I will heed this sage advice and tear down my CAMP today to reconstitute as a KISS (Keep It Simple &lt;because I'm&gt; Stupid) CAMP. 
---
Thanks u/Riomanski!
---
I have over 1000 hours lmaooo
---
Paranoid? Or perhaps we've seen this happen in many other games.
---
Also the fact Bethesda mentioned refrigeration and other benefits like remote stash deposit alongside repair kits. it wasn't just repair kits mentioned.
---
I'll have to give that a try!
---
Its possible that was part of the update then. I heard about the character limit before they took the servers down again. Nice to know if it is the case (because god kniws the lag wasn't fixed LOL)
---
Happens to me and I'm on PS4. It's like c'mon you'd be dead by now!
---
The radscorpion venom syringer does something like that. But it's completely useless due to its low damage.
---
Yea I'm curious please do if you can
---
Is their an hour counter? I'm on ps4 and was looking for one and can't find anything
---
Meh I'm on PC
---
Username is hardposs it’s in the post, send me a message and I’ll give you the details !
---
I see a lot of RP potential without them, too.
---
A few quests in the Mire, heart of the swamp/ irrational fear, uranium fever unlocked it for me.
---
Anyone here feel free to add it's StrawberryTsuki
---
Thank you, I love you, all my base are belong to you etc.
---
If you're on xbox please add me, same ign
---
You can usually tell it’s on cool down if the event doesn’t start for you when you go there
---
But I'm only a level 22 and am 2
---
shots from death
---
1300.I want my 20 atoms!😂
---
Your ini file went kaput
---
That’s too much to ask for. I’d be happy enough if there’s a Legendary mod that would allow me to add a second mod to my PA parts. Ordinary armors can have three with wayyyu OP multiplying effects (sentinel assassin for example), while PA is only allowed to have one, and after recent patches they drain batteries so quickly now. Why punishing PA so hard. Do they want to sell those fancy PA skins or not.
---
Options - Challenges - Character - 5th challenge i believe.
---
Under challenges, just look at your progress towards the 7600 hrs challenge
---
So because other companies have done it, that automatically means Bethesda and everyone else will? That's literally what paranoia is, my dude.
---
This is the first time I'm hearing about those features being unique to in-game purchases. Source please?
---
I can im on ps4
---
But further,  -4 intelligence,  I can't see that really impacting your character?  Unless there is one of those pop up screens that you can do something based on your special.  I only really care about impacts to strength.   Maybe agility effects your aim?  But if you are physically aiming and not VATS it shouldn't matter... sometimes I'll take the chem that boosts luck before a bunch of crafting hoping to trigger super duper more, not sure if it works.  There are lots of things about this game that have been discussed in a reddit posting...
---
The dev's have commented from the beginning that we would be getting the ability to 'dispaly' not free form decorate like a closed server type game. 
---
That means basically putting something in one of the shelves but not setting the table
---
I’m pretty sure I’m completely obsessed... 650hrs in
---
“It has great potential” - this games subtitle.
---
There's several of these buttons around. Are they all exits from silos? Never bothered with silo's yet.
---
673. Level 232
---
Oh good I thought it was just my camp lol
---
Damage resistance and damage mitigation are two different things. Sentinel is damage mitigation. The ER on leather armor or power armor is damage resistance.
---
Which Queen - the Mirelurk Queen? 
---
I have to wonder .. do the Queens have a battle of acid spits? \*ptoo!\* Oh yeah, well \*ptoo!\* back atcha! *etc. etc.*
---
Good to hear there’s hope, I’ve just modded my P.A with the medic pump so less time is wasted in the spawn screen and the pylons can stay on, (and if needs be il be able to do all 3 myself) and I equipped pharma pharma 3 and grabbed myself the Stims the medic pump is going to fly through, also going to try an automatic troubleshooter handmade with the commando and tank killer perks and see how that goes, fingers crossed lol
---
The Gatling is decent once you spec into it and get used to the quirky aim. I shoot SBs out of the air with my 2 shot Gatling.
---
My first character was a stealth sniper build and I absolutely hated it! I maxed perception and agility. It’s what I played at launch and by the time I was level 50+ I couldn’t keep up with my melee teammates during events because vats was so glitchy and would lock on to them from far away. I quit playing in December.
---
I started a new character that’s a melee/power armor build and I am falling back in love with the game. My strength is maxed, but my other stats are more evenly distributed. I’m only level 35ish now, but the heavy sledgehammer with the rocket mod is great!
---
I've thought from the moment they nerfed the cap loss in Survival that they had went a bit overboard. Survival is about more risk, more rewards. The rewards structure has stayed the same, but the risk factor was minimized to a ridiculous degree.
---
i'd pay $10 for this.
---
Yes, to have a valid opiniin on a product you absolutely need to use it.
---
You can have your own opinion, but as far as discussing a game on a forum dedicated to that game you need to have played it unless you're asking "should I play it?"
---
Try going to a Jeep forum and saying they're dangerous to drive because "that's what you heard", you'll get absolutely roasted.
---
Handmade with penetration mag and hardened receiver for weapon with a covert commando glass cannon build.  1 shot most enemies and with gunfire and grim reaper I clear rooms super fast.
---
Went back and played fallout 4 and NPCs and a living breathing world makes a huge difference. They don’t even seem like the same world really.
---
I never see the fast travel location up if the event isn't ready.
---
It is a lot of clicks.  I'm an impatient bastard sometimes.  
---
*Fire up XBox*
---
Click on FO76
---
Click on "Disconnected from Server" message left over from when I shut down.
---
Click on a button to login
---
Click on a button to bypass the news
---
Click on a button to play
---
Click on a button to choose Adventure Mode
---
Then when the game finally loads, I have to sit there and wait another 30-45 seconds while the creatures and environment around me loads.  God forbid I load into the Whitespring Golf Club.  I'll be taking damage from ghouls I can't even see yet.
---
If your vendor rng is good, trick out your suit with optimized bracers and motion assist, helps with power attacks and damage respectively. Melee is just too OP
---
The fast travel point is always available.  But it just sometimes takes a few minutes to load.  Like Al’s Tattoo, it only appears on the map once fully loaded.
---
He wouldn’t be fierce if he needed help.....
---
Glass cannons are becoming more common I’ve come to realize
---
Lol. That isn't very helpful. I need the crafting and the team ready to go. I play solo, which is the first issue. Haha.
---
Kinda have 3 that I swap between when needed. Support Melee, Farming Melee/Explosives, and DPS Melee.
---
Wow, only 9.99. can I tip? I wanna pay more
---
Same i was thinking of doing the new quest but the game still looks like an unbalanced mess form the new boss fight on youtube. This engine cant support this game or Bethesda have no idea what balance is.
---
I have started to as I get the caps for it, I only recently figured it out haha
---
Uh, Junkies is one of the more popular prefixs out right now, up there with bloodied and AA.
---
They also should de-aggro if you hide in a building
---
The beer keg is a reward from a weekly challenge for brewing
---
Now I wonder how many times I server hopped thinking it wasn't refreshed.
---
Best of luck to you in that build man, you’ll be hella good with those mods
---
My character is a medic super sledge and 50cal build for the player faction enclave
---
Haven’t seen one of those before 🤔
---
It’s perfectly reasonable to lose respect and drop your support for a youtuber based on their opinions and views. Your contention is basically I like this guy so everyone should too or you’re an idiot. Total garbage.
---
The other mounted things can't be gotten as of yet. They are part of a loot pool that isn't assigned to anything
---
I have been in and out since release. Its a much better game since launch. Still needs some work.
---
Another crybaby that thinks repair kits are pay to win.  -braced for crybaby downvotes-
---
Had to search what "PSA" means, now I learned 2 things out of this post, good job.
---
Dude, just do as you’re told. Why get angry?
---
I’ll see if I can.
---
Can we start a petition to make this a thing? Just start paging the the employees with mentions until Bethesda caves to our demands?
---
I want this so bad now
---
Its actualy fun i use a medics gause rifle medics auto grenade launcher and medics single action the suoer sledge is the all rise and a normal 50cal since i have a friend with a lead deposit at his base that he doesnt need he gives my group lead to use and me for some ammo to sell to players
---
Solid build.. The only suggestions I'd make:
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f6145eb&amp;d=la2l71lt2lu2s52ss2si2sj2se2pe2eu0a04ao0aj2ir2ib1ar2am1cu2cm0pj2&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=268cfh
---
You might also want to consider switching one of your strength cards out for Barbarian if you're doing a Bloodied build.
---
Whoa, what a rebel.
---
I believe that’s the only way to tell if you need to hop servers at the moment. Would be nice if there was a miscellaneous notification saying how long was left
---
So you’re a huge team player then, yeah?
---
Smearing shit on the wall is a fun game...
---
how much time do they have?
---
No it's just my own speculation
---
I'm not, but I have gotten it in places where I was FAR away from the Compound.
---
Whyever not?
---
I guess i am
---
I seriously believe these types of posts are from someone at Bethesda’s marketing team trying to gauge new ideas for merchandise.
---
I noticed last night that PA frames are setup in a way which could allow mods to be placed on them. Legendary PA frames... 😯
---
Spoilers bruh. Add the tag.
---
The grounded perk is a real pain in the ass
---
Can a brotha get a confederate flag?
---
So why ask if that’s what you saw?
---
Also, weather, sonic attacks, enemies spotting you, sunshine, pretty much every fucking thing.
---
This is probably one of the few things that really bothers me about this game, shelter. It's like an invisible prop to the game, but a good hallucination for me.
---
Yesterday the countdown said 4 days. So they should be there all weekend
---
I already got a mini collection of supernatural stuff so this would be a fine addition
---
Sounds like a guy I’d have fun being up against. Need more of that in 76 tbh
---
What do you think is better for the gun? Semi-auto or auto?
---
hey repair kits haven't been put into the game yet . explosive guns have been reduced slightly.  theres 2 new kind of dlc ones a hole side quest the others a daily one for new alcohol
---
It's the "new normal" until Bethesda fixes it. I have 200+ people in my list and it's completely unmanageable.
---
My Xbox gt is MergedSpy93289
---
It’s usually mirelurk  queen sometimes it’s legendary.
---
so i basically have 2 days to farm.well its my loss. how much do they cost?
---
Ultimately, I feel that's what this sub is best at when utilized properly; encouraging different perspectives in the community to debate and discuss and maybe agree or even agree to disagree.  Different is good to me.  You are obviously into the PVP aspects of this game and would like to see it be pure with no exploitable features. Survival, for all it's faults is a step in the right direction as is Adventure for all its faults.  Steps are all we are going to get with Bethesda here and I'm inclined to be grateful for any improvement rather than none. There will always be toxic people who want to smash and grab with no consequence, then cry and whine when they get the tables turned. Personally, I have hated some aspects of the game since the beginning, but accepted it, played it, learned from it and overall, enjoyed the hell out of it. I don't understand "griefing" as a playstyle and never will.  It's totally different from "raiding" and I accept the raider as a challenge (workshops for instance).  I would like to see the bullet time animation of me blowing some little punks head off who screams into his mike and calls me an asshole because I won't sell my best weapons to him for 500 caps though....
---
I go for the Assault rifle every time. Automatic build is underrated by the community
---
Ikr what type of device you play on me ps4
---
500 atoms
---
Dude you don't even know what you are talking about in regards to how loot works in online games. You argued with me that diablo 2 didn't have guaranteed drops from end game bosses. Yet, hellfire diablo drops an annihulus charm every time you kill him, the 3 ubers in uber tristram after opening the portal with the keys will drop a hellfire torch every time they are killed.
---
This just shows that you don't know what you are talking about and are willing to talk about things you are ignorant of and end up spreading incorrect information.
---
So please stop trying to discourage the players who want this game to not be absolute trash.
---
Had been running with be lever and love it.  Recently acquired a be handmade and having a lot of fun with it.  I’m torn.
---
The rifleman/sniper build is a fun build from what I heard.  It can be really fun and I'm gonna probably try it out.
---
right. thanks for telling me.
---
They are not pay to win I don't think but was kinda odd to make them buyable through the Atom store just after all the bad press was dying down. Not gonna change the game for me personally but it's just another excuse for people to right essays on YongYea videos (or reddit) about how bad this game is.
---
Glad to hear it. Hit me up when you're moved in to your frozen tundra and we'll do the arena again
---
Don't sell it, I will list my build BE gauss is the second hardest hitting ranged weapon variant in game, behind a BE dragon...
---
Not 100% sure but I think intelligence makes you level up faster
---
I usually use rifles and melee. my go to weapons are the lever action rifle and the power fist. I will occasionally switch off between the sniper rifle and the Bowie knife. So you could say I have a melee rifle build.
---
I'm excited to get this weapon a try because it's really good.
---
I'm running a chainsaw build. It's fun but not particularly powerful. Its amazing for mobbing though, fighting ghouls is a breeze.
---
You capitalize in odd places.
---
It’s that they are not just cosmetic. Which, in no uncertain words, Bethesda said that the Atomic Shop would only be cosmetic.
---
That’s what people are talking about.
---
Thats how i interpreted it as well.  That was the funniest part of that quest when he talked about the reprogramming then got screwed lol
---
\[Bug\] When the Fermenter is full, the message of the error dialog is just the label id, PC, English. [Image](https://imgur.com/a/fSiznrL).
---
I’m on PS4
---
Add me too, zzzeph
---
when you preview items in the atomic shop, sometimes the picture will have an item thats bot out yet, im always looking at the pictures to get ideas on whats coming out soon
---
Wanna meet up later
---
Yeah, thats a fair point.
---
Dude most of the challenges are fine and easy, relax
---
Furious explosive handmade 🙌🏼
---
2 different repair kits, plus you originally said you would buy them cause they will drop, when the ones you can buy don't drop. Blanent false information
---
Little things please little minds.
---
Lever would be easier as far as ammo is concerned
---
563. I think is save to say i got my moneys worth
---
Is it maybe on a timer? I can milk mine, but I only try about once a day when I’m doing camp maintenance/crop harvesting etc.
---
I think I might have the plan for it in my stash.
---
Melee rifle is pretty good imo
---
I love it
---
Oooo, you’ll have to send me that build...asking for a friend...
---
I never said dangerous to drive I said dangerous for turning and they both failed the deer test so it's not really arguable as is the fact that Bethesda did A LOT of anti consumer practices that would push most people away (me included but I did get it for free and played about 60 hours). 
---
If your company has anti consumer practices and sells a product that isn't finished then yes anyone can say bad things about it and steer clear without giving money to the company they are boycotting. If you watch actual gameplay you can come up to your own conclusions, I'd say basing your opinion on trailers would be going too far.
---
This is one of my favorite activities to do. I have a solid system in place.
---
 I use a sniper rifle to tag two of the thrusters 6x each to slow it down. When you see them smoking you've damaged them well enough. 
---
Make sure you tag them as it's close to you otherwise it might get slowed down high up where your shots can't reach. 
---
This has happened to me.  Had to climb all the way to top of scorchbeast nest in Watoga to reach it. And my shots were just making it. So watch your surroundings and time it right.
---
I then murder two of the vertibots leaving the third because I've found that if you kill all three sometimes the cargobot flies off. 
---
Then go back to cargobot and start taking the flight control module out.  
---
When it is stationary is the air just hovering murder the final vertibot and then finish off cargobot.
---
Then go collect rewards :)
---
I used to run it before I went full bore shotgun
---
Sure, if I’m on!
---
The game has been fine since launch if you're used to Bethesda games and expect issues (In Daggerfall, for example, you couldn't do the main questline if you didn't do the first quest within a month game time, which wasn't fixed for quite some time). If you're impatient or stuck-up and demanding perfection right off the bat, I can see where there would have been issues.  But I've been having a blast since the BETA.  
---
The game has been running pretty decently for a while, so I don't know where your "sloppy shite" comment comes from. I am assuming troll, but just in case: yes, it is worth playing.
---
Ingot the handmade but haven’t tried the be lever yet, nobody seems to be selling. 
---
But the handmade is nice, love to auto rounds
---
No, XP is not based on Intelligence in 76
---
I occasionally use the shotgun but I just fly through the ammo, I need to go grind some scortched for some more.
---
Don't throwing weapons always fly straight? You might not need the three points in fire in the hole.
---
Don’t you put that evil on him, Ricky Bobby!!
---
The more you know.
---
Not cool man, not cool....
---
Sure, I'll open nukesdragons
---
what am I missing. leveling seems slow for me. Only level 32 been playing off and on since launch.
---
I have a melee build, and I can go toe to toe with the biggest enemies in the game, and hardly break a sweat, but that thing.... it scares me.
---
Get White Knight (Agility) and Fix It Good (Intelligence)... Allows you to repair to 200% and slows it's degredation... I can go hours in game before I even have to think of repairs and I'm running a sneak build as well.
---
Hit watoga high and Morgantown high for plastic, and use Ammosmith and super duper when you craft it
---
Yeah it would be good and if you kill a scorch beast you get acid from its glands to refill viles of it for extra corrosive damage as a mod upgrade from normal acid
---
If you're having trouble with a raider in x01 armor, then neither of you know what you're doing lmao
---
That's fair. I said this because he played the beta for the mobile elder scrolls game then replied with "another catastrophic bethesda product" but all he knows about Fallout 76 is that it had a rocky launch and youtubers were frothing at the mouth to talk badly about it for views. Every little fuckwad youtuber got on the view bandwagon, some of them never played the game and just talked shit for views. That in turn made the gaming community not even look at the game as an option, and I am pretty sure that is where he gets his opinion of Fallout 76.
---
For reference he likes every bethesda Fallout game and Elder Scrolls game, I'm pretty sure he is just being narrow minded about 76 and refuses to give it a legit shot. It's ok by me, and I honestly feel like it's his loss, but you can not like a game that you haven't played based on what you heard. I still think that calling it a "catastrophic bethesda product" without playing is a tad overboard imo.
---
To be fair, I have my gripes about 76 and I am sure you do too. Everyone who plays it thinks it can be improved.
---
Oh and also, I bought it blind for $80 (yeah I was a sucker and got the tricentennial edition) and feel I am still getting my money worth to this day. I wish I only got the base game, but hindsight is 20/20.
---
Most quest times are weightless, keys are usually weightless aren’t they?
---
I have 5 roses syringers and i cant drop them they kept duplicating themselves
---
Who’s angry? And who’s a dude?
---
Wow sweet thanks dood
---
It’s not worth anything really, it’s a common drop that is not often utilized.
---
I come out of watoga high with like 135+ plastic every run I do
---
That’s pretty gay
---
We just have to keep posting and upvoting
---
I’ve been playing on X1X and it didn’t run any worse than before, as far as I could tell.
---
I think they broke this when they fixed the, "build an indistructable base out of foundations" exploit.
---
Let's add this to the list of other fix n breaks
---
Vats melee nerfed when they fixed vats ranged.
---
And, broke repairing and modding gear when they added renaming gear.
---
This last one really really surprising me. It's like there is zero validation going on at Beth.
---
Yep I found that out while I was trying to pre-fix all the stuff I’m hoarding for the legendary vendor with “LV”  lol
---
The employee probably was the manager.
---
Amazing how many threads are asking for new features and the game isn't consistently playable.
---
Lvl 66 here, just took down a lvl 65 SB with my gatling gun. Fired randomly in it's general direction and it died in 220 bullets. If it landed, I'd bring out my Zealous MG42 and mow it down immediately. Things definitely got easier after lvl 50/heavy gun buff.
---
Give BSG until fall, balancing should be much better bye then 😉
---
More flags plz
---
Also maybe some variants like flags on poles for outside. When a breeze kicks up or a storm rolls in, they can COMMENCE TO JIGGLIN.
---
The employee probably was the manager. Most game places like that actually do try to protect the customers from bad games, they will try to warn people before they purchase a game the employee knows is garbage.
---
Idk, my mom hit a deer in hers, she's fine. 
---
Now you're getting into a discussion about the developer that was blown way out of proportion, and let to people saying things like "the game isn't finished" when constant improvements and content was their plan from the start which BGS was open about.
---
Once you start hitting mobs and they take no damage, once you stealth and the whole AI horde of normally dumb zombies know you're exactly behind the container right around the corner even from a mile away, once you get 12 respawns on your position that instantly attack you, once you go to an area at level 20 but all the mobs are level 60+ and pretty much 2-shot you, once you realize your character is too dumb to use a gun because of a level restriction (pulling a trigger = hard) then you'll realize the game is utter shit. That was just some of the things that happened in more or less 3 hours of play yesterday. FF15 it is tonight.
---
I’m sorry OP, but you spelled Texas wrong!
---
Fisto pet &gt; Bug fixes &gt; content &gt; quality of life &gt; cosmetics &gt; lighting
---
Thanks gonna do that.
---
ya, it's the biggest reason I keep the pharma perk. Getting all the extra chems are good to sell and I keep maybe 2 of each.
---
You'll be able to spend real money on something that's far inferior to actual perks. It's more "pay to frustrate yourself by having to repair more often" or "pay to break things mid-fight more often." Yes, you save some repair costs -- but the materials to repair are negligible once you level up and get the right perks. The faux outrage is comical, really. Even more than when they screamed "PAY TO WIN" over people you are grouped with wearing clothes that match a theme giving you a miniscule bonus to something (you had in-game options as well and the bonus didn't matter).
---
Well, the confusion comes because the Russian word for “moth” sounds like “mole”. But the translator actually didn’t translate “man”. Like always they used some own interpretation.
---
I haven;t been able to play anything since the update came out so I haven't seen that yet.
---
Awesome. If you see me online hop on over bud!
---
Likewise it seems that people take any negative comment about this game as a personal insult to them if they like the game.
---
I think the cool down period could be made a bit smaller, but I also think that someone needs to step up and "take charge." Honestly, it's effing chaos unless someone is actively paying attention to what the screen is telling you to do. I think folks don't pay attention because they are 1. overwhelmed by the robots and 2. focusing on tagging the sheepsquatch to get the loot/drop. 
---
Now, I will say, someone getting on the mic and telling everyone what to do can be a bit annoying and had that happen at a few Fasnacht events too (a little bit too "I'm in charge"), but a simple "activate the pylons and then you can hit the sheesquatch when it is vulnerable." and maybe a "if a few folks could focus on the robots, we'll let you know when to tag the sheepsquatch" type thing could be helpful. I can't think of another way to do it, but... I guess, less "take charge" or more guide the group to a successful completion of the event. The same way you'd do it if you were on a team for an event.
---
I do wish we could get a holo that you could read to tell you how long the cool down still is. Like the mission silo holo that tells gives you a readout about whether the silos have been launched recently. Super helpful when deciding whether to launch a nuke, it'd be great to have something so you could... server hop if you needed too.
---
Yep
---
It hardly seems worth the effort to run a PA build
---
It's called Molerot in Russian.
---
Mol - Small
---
Rot - Mouth
---
Kind of scary in my book.
---
It's clear that whoever wrote that article hasn't played the game or just wanted to stir shit.
---
What changed?
---
$37.49 on Amazon right now.
---
That will require a patch, which will break 5 other features and cause server disconnects.
---
Hopewell cave spawns a scorchbeast and a deathclaw. Sometimes the deathclaw spawns outside the cave by accident and I always help the DC take on the adds and drop the SB myself. 
---
He's never very appreciative of the help though...
---
PC here. MadTurin in-game. I've only been playing a couple of weeks or so and have largely kept to the Forest as I've not poked my snout into all of the nooks and crannies just yet. It takes a while. Stumbled across the entrance to Vault 51 yesterday.
---
Appreciate the help
---
If they spent half as much time on the lighting as they do on creating stuff (that looks like it comes out of a cartoon and not a post-apocalyptic wasteland) to place in the Atom shop I think they could fix it... But hey, ya know, money &gt; quality...
---
Don't get me wrong I love the game, I just hate dealing with all the other corporate aspects of it. Is what it is.
---
The just updated yesterday. You can now change your PSN name in the settings tab under account management on you PS4 or plus.
---
Most keys and Quest items are, a couple aren't. But I just don't want to see 18 copies each of the alpha and Bravo key cards especially when they don't stack. That's 36 extra items I have to scroll by each time.
---
I always wondered if there would be a use for all those in game ballot printers. Everyone one of them has an "activate" option....
---
Passive effects. Every SPECIAL has 2 passive benefits. Temporary buffs (really, anything other than the points you actually assign when you up level) do not affect how many perks you can use.
---
Strength gives melee damage and Carry weight. Perception increase accuracy in VATS as well as enemy/location detection range on your compass. Endurance gives health and reduces sprint AP drain. Charisma affects buy/sell prices and increases “rewards” from quests/events (I’m not sure what that really means). Intelligence increases general XP gain and max condition of crafted items. Agility affects your action points and your sneak rating. Luck affects the max condition of (most) items you find in the world, and how fast your crit meter fills in VATS.
---
This morning I was farming super mutants, and the hits didnt animate or take down health, but they flopped over dead in the normal number of hits (2-3 since i didnt want to change perk cards).
---
Tried this a few times, thanks.  No success.  I've also fiddled with my modem and router.  I think it might be a router issue since it's not playing well with the modem. Though I really only have my router to save on phone data for myself and guests.  When I hook my PS4 up to the modem I get a net connection so I'm going to try again tonight when I'm home.  Fun times in online gaming I guess :P
---
Fair for all sides imo.
---
"Mol" doesn't stand for small.  It's just nonsense. Pretty sure they just mispelled molerat, which is a mistake within a mistake.
---
Lol.  Wellbgokd luck man sorry I couldn't help
---
This thread has been up for over three hours and no one has said Chally the Moo Moo ? What is wrong with you people?!
---
It depends on how you want to play the game, the weapons you prefer etc. Do you have any ideas on how you want to build your character? and are you thinking of pve, pvp or both?
---
I would love if I could use the single staircase on anything but the center of a floor piece. Right now I have to use the grated upper floor/staircase piece in my home and it looks so odd going from nice wooden floors to that.
---
Full troubleshooters might work well too
---
I pew pew with a anti-armor 50 cal and power armor. I used to be a two shot explosive 50 cal kinda guy, but then I took a nerf to the knee. Solo content is murder-nation. Group content (SBG, sheepsquatch event) I usually mow down adds and act as a DPS support.
---

---
I'm not trolling at all, you do realise that games can peffom differently on different system right?
---
Not a bad idea. But I couldn't move based on sentinel armor. I might try it next time.
---
"Sentimental Rifleman" is what I term myself. Mainly because "pack rat" sounds so negative. 
---
Rifleman perks (non-automatic) with a LOT weight reduction via perks and armor. 
---
Taking off all weight reduction my carried weight is 700+. Everything equipped is 175 or so. 
---
Can't use PA often due to the armor perks of weight reduction being negated, but for the way I am generally solo, works well enough. I'm definitely not overpowered at all, but I hold my own in a fight. Some of the more chaotic events can be a trick though.
---
I want a “sheepsquatch ate my brother” shirt with just the poster on the front
---
Raises 2 hands! Really like the idea of customizable ones to create your own faction
---
Honestly for me it was getting lucky around level 30ish where everytime I would login whitesprings would be nuked and I would go in with a bunch of mentats. I was able to level 5-6 times while farming whitesprings with high INT
---
daddy, chill
---
And this stuff right there is exaclty why I've changed my language to english.
---
Even worse was a week or so ago, had some guy start his reply in a thread, " I've never played this game and never intend to and I think.... trash... junk... stupid.... etc."  My reply was "Yet here you are, skulking around in this sub running your mouth and telling us why we are stupid for playing this game?" I mean why would you lurk around a sub of a game you didn't even want to play?  Some people have way too much time on their hands I think.
---
It's not that bad anymore. They have been fixing it alot. I have been recommending it to my friends who at start didn't want to buy it. Especially now when you can get it for 8-10 euros from cdkeys stores.
---
Real Sheepsquatch is coming. The workshop messages are the proof.
---
Same. For this one I whip out my AA handmade and keep it in front of me. If she closes in I jump on the roof like a bitch.
---
Good idea. Thank you.
---
Could you DM me this build? I’m actually interested in making my alt something like this
---
Mothmouth you mean? Well, that's just strange.
---
if you get killed by one ZeroTheGamerJ
---
then get rekked noob lol xD /s
---
Yeah actually that’s the way how they translated it in Russia.
---
Firecracker berry whiskey! I’ve only seen other talk about it but I hear it has some really amazing effects
---
Not for me on PC, was playing last night and the issue was still there.
---
Im thinking primarily a build that would be good for both. A tank with power armor that swoops in on a jetpack sounds fun.
---
Id rather pay for DLC than get repair kits in the atom shop.
---
On the topic of underarmors, anyone know why they dont show up for me to craft after I purchase then read them? Do I need a certain leveled perk equipped?
---
Have you heard any updates about this because I’m in the same boat as you and ngl I just wanna play on my account again
---
Damage over time?
---
LOL What a rude new neighbor you have, so sorry to hear that. My CAMP is on the lake across from Lewisburg Station a bit farther south. The event doesn’t interfere with my build thankfully, but I can always hear once it’s started!
---
Why say that? All DLC is free
---
Yea the new excavator skin is very nice but since PA can’t compete with magic legendary armors, I’m not going to buy it and look funny.
---
Yeah besides the bugs out there, this is my least favorite thing about the update.  Really do not like it at all.
---
I run fist melee and rifles most of the time, heavy luck, 1 point of endurance. Swap cards for heavy guns for nuke zones, AA .50 cal shreds most baddies.
---
but if they are not affecting the health of the queen like you thought, was difference does it make if they are there? if they werent there you would be expending the same amount of ammo/resources...
---
does this make sense?
---
I've thought dressing up to get the sheepsquatch to try to mate with you was honestly going to be the mechanic from the second I saw that terrified look on the dweller from the trailer. 
---
And I bet Bethesda is pissed that everyone is stomping around in Quantum armor 3 days after it dropped like it's nothing so they are going to make their riddles a bit harder.
---
You never ran into days where it was unplayable or hours upon hours wasted where you can not get 5 feet without an invisible scorchbeast or two killing you.   The game is amazing at times but it was also unfinished and tossed some of the most fundamental aspects of the Fallout series in the garbage.
---
It was brutal last night. And it was just random play. Just walking around and disconnect, then extreme lag entering a new map area. Invisible enemies, barely being able to move, hanging in mid air on a jump. Really awful. Nothing changed for me other than them doing a hotfix, and I was not experiencing this frequency of issues until yesterday.
---
Killed it solo. It's fine.
---
867 hours, 3 playable toons. lvl212, 232, 36
---
Not enough people understand this part of the theme. 
---
This isnt the post-apocalypse. It's the post-post-apocalypse. An interesting angle you don't see in too many examples.
---
idk if anyone has talked about this but we should also be able to build our own vendor bots, someone to tend the shop while you're out and about
---
&gt;Real Sheepsquatch is coming. The workshop messages are the proof.
---
Proof, or intentionally misleading teases?
---
Makes sense now. You guys rock, thanks!
---
Oh my god this would be so cool. We need an Appalachian version of 3 dog to announce upcoming / ongoing / completed events.
---
yeah my biggest beef with this event is that it needs coordination but if you're not the persons launching the event you have ZERO time for coordination. as soon as you fast travel in that invisible demon is ON you.
---
You’re welcome bud!
---
I understand why the current design does not include power armor pieces, and I'm leaning toward agreeing that legendary power armor would be unfun.
---
Legendary armor can be quite powerful. It can make you extremely hard to kill, it can boost your stats, enhance your stealth, etc. However, there are some things even the best legendary armor cannot do; for example, if you walk into a nuke zone in anything other than power armor or a hazmat suit, you'll get real crispy real quick. And while marsupial is great, you'll never be able to *fly* (for short boosts) like you can with a jetpack. 
---
So the idea is that different types of armor do different things. If power armor could do all the things legendary armor can do, there would be no point in ever getting out of your power armor frame, and I think that's good design. If there were one type of armor that is strictly superior to another type of armor in all circumstances, then that's removing an important player decision from the game and makes the armor metagame a little less interesting.
---
On PS4 Events are unplayable almost.
---
This all day
---
🙌
---
Yeah, Ive noticed the frame rate issue too. Know its not my connection (300mbps) and im on the xbox one x. The sheepsquatch event is especially brutal on the frame rate. Its an awesome event, but with so many players and AI enemies in one place, its choppy af.
---
I bought it but never got into it, is it better now than it was before?
---
I’ve been playing daily since my fiancée got it for my birthday in November. I absolutely love this game! I’m still only a level 54,, since I just generally wander and explore, but I seem to find new content daily. I can’t say enough how much I appreciate this game!
---
Dude they’re cheap as hell, complete a few daily challenges and you got a repair kit. Don’t be daft.
---
I enjoyed the game until I got to like level 60 and I haven’t played since December
---
Didnt all the people in Whitespring end up in the dumpsters out back?
---
Shit i just bought the plan, because it came up as something I didn't know, can't do anything with it. Should have checked Reddit first.
---
I knew this was gonna happen. Same thing with ESO, except it took them a couple years before they added a huge MT advertisement on every log in.
---
If someone played Eso there is a collection system that I like it. When you find a lorebook, it goes to collection and you can read it when you want.
---
So what about if we have same system in fo76? Maybe with different mechanics. So let me explain, they will continue to come to inventory. After quest, we will add them to collection. It's can work for keys too. This doors will be unlockable if we have this keys in our inventory or collection.
---
So we can see which note or holo we are missing. We won't have dozens of same keys. And, our stash or inventory will have less items so it's mean that game will have minor adjustment about performance and stability. With true way, this can be good opportunity for both of players and developers.
---
Agreed! Can you make the game playable then add stuff please!?
---
What platform you play on
---
Agreed. This game didn't get a fair shot at launch. I get it was the worse of the two games released (released with RDR2 which I love) but it just wasn't fair how it was treated from the get go. Now you have people who think you have bad taste in games because you play and enjoy 76. It has come a long way since BETA and I can't wait to see where it goes.
---
i wanted to see if its real or not
---
There really should be a megathread for this topic. People ask it multiple times a day.
---
What a trailblazer man upboat for you!
---
Huh. That is wierd. Never heard of it changing on its own.
---
Looks much more like a mistake than a tease.
---
To me a Mothman plushie sounds good to me I would buy it
---
It used to pop up in the watoga vendor and harpers ferry. Haven't seen that mod show quite awhile though.
---
In all seriousness I don’t care what they sell in the atom shop. If it helps pay to keep the game going for all of us and if a few want to shell out money to get a small advantage. Then that’s fine. We all know some developer needs to feed his/her family and this game can expand with the times. I could careless what was said in the past, if it helps drive the game forward then so be it. All long as well all benefit and continue to receive timely updates and new content.  In fact, I’ll go ahead and buy some atoms today(again) so you don’t have to pay. The next updates on me.
---
Maybe but i'm more interested in the bonus distance. I hope i can reach scorchebeasts mid flight with it.
---
True, but I've been leaving them by default just in case I'm playing quietly. Also, I can read a lot faster than the audio plays, sometimes that saves quite a bit of time.
---
Candy bars
---
Yeah this is  royal pain in the ass, stop fixing things that arent broken..... its one thing to make an improvement, but this even if it was working just makes it more work to fix your shit
---
Are you on PC?
---
Thanks for the suggestion! Passing that along :)
---
Correct. We're investigating this issue now and we're currently working toward a fix for our next update. Thanks for your reports, all!
---
I think your on to something I had a theory that the map on the wall might tell use where it would spawn at
---
Oh yes for sure. It seems to be a general thing which ever side of the fence you are on. Wish it could be more like...I don't like this. But it's cool that you do. Instead it turns into personal insults about taste. Or time. Or money. People are allowed to enjoy different things. World would be a pretty dull place if we didn't and there would never be any creative ideas.
---
Just curious because there’s been a few posts of items disappearing since the last patch. Had you renamed it?
---
Ahhhhhh but  PTW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I am beast and I deserve to will at everything forever!!!!!!!
---
Gotcha, I'm on mobile.
---
We're aware of this one and actively investigating the issue. Thanks for your reports!

I have several.

I have a sniper centered on stealth and the lever action. Carries a Furious faster reload VATS lever gun. This is part of a sniper duo designed to work together.

I have a melee tank. Carries a variety of hammers, and switches depending on need. Opener is a furious, tends to switch to bloodied as the fight wears on, for obvious reasons. General walking about and junk runs I just carry all rise to swat annoyances.

Others I still experiment with. Junkie stealth stabber is in the works.
---
about "rot" - my other guess - it can be plural hebrew sounding of "roth" - like uncontrolled community of dark powers, manifested in eerily winged creature.
---
Like, we have Sefiroth, Azathoth etc.
---
than his given name - Moler.
---
Have a buddy hit it?
---
What about the low levels that do not have caps? Would you mind a scaling cap bounty based on player levels? 1-10 20 caps etc etc
---
Craft it.  It’s super easy to get thousands.
---
&gt; If they spent half as much time on the lighting as they do on creating stuff
---
You do understand that those responsible for creating atom shop content are in not the ones responsible for coding how lighting works...
---
Scrap everything. Save gears springs and lead
---
&gt; because vats was so glitchy and would lock on to them from far away
---
Good news. VATS no longer targets friendlies. Way less glitchy as a result.
---
Yeah. pretty much no-one has poison resistance, so theoretically it would be really good.
---
It increases the accuracy stat by a small amount so ...yes? But I don’t know exactly how that small increase actually effects things in the game’s mechanics. The visual does help me aim at least.
---
In which of the following updates will it be included though?
---
|4/16|Burrows|
---
|:-|:-|
---
|4/23|Camera|
---
|5/7|Pioneer Scouts / Player Vending|
---
|5/23|Legendary Vendor|
---
Craft with Ammosmith and Super Duper.
---
I want more of anything. More structures. More decor. More furniture. Everything. We have a quarter of what we had in FO4 and Bethesda will drip feed us it until this community PRAISES them for adding so many things into the game; EVEN THOUGH they will just port the items over.
---
Ok maybe it's not paranoia, since I don't know your notivation. But it's absolutely catastrophizing, meaning you're actively looking for the worst possible outcome instead of the facts. Point is that it's not valid logic. If it is, you're going to need to actually present an argument that's better than "other companies do it, therefore Bethesda will too".
---
Nothing in there says anything about stuff being in the premium shop except repair kits. Did you not notice the "As we look into the future" sentence? You're making a pretty massive leap there, assuming that everything they mention is going to be atomic shop exclusives. Again, you're catastrophizing.
---
I think you just need to admit that you don't trust Bethesda anymore, and learn to agree to disagree instead of portraying your opinion as fact.
---
Ammo Smith and super duper?
---
Keep your lead and other metals.   And maybe go around with a meale weapon and kill mutants and other things that use weapons.     And take their ammo until you have a lot
---
Put on max ammosmith and superduper cards.
---
I just hung up my NCR flag last night lol. Awesome timing. Would love to have one in game.
---
It really does matter what people say on the internet. I’m still playing with or without ptw. Buggy and broken.
---
Same here. My buddies aren't pleased with the game either. So I picked up the lone wanderer perk until I find some friends the old fashioned way. By dropping the food and water I don't need to lower level players and having them ask for help
---
Yup. Use both of those and you can get TONS of ammo quickly.
---
On the bright side, you will easily find people on this subreddit that will party up with you. This subreddit has avoided a lot of other video game community subs toxicity.
---
How much does super duper go up to and what does increasing level do. Increase chance of it doubling ?
---
Yep.  It's like people don't understand that searching is a thing.
---
If you want an answer to your question, it's way easier to search than it is to make a whole new topic and then let the replies slowly trickle in one by one.  The information you seek is already there.  Look for it.  You're gonna be dead someday.
---
So according to your explanation our localizers created “Mothroth”.
---
So from the above stats why doesn't it do what you're saying? I can't get it to hit anywhere near the TSE
---
Exactly it’s fun. People act as if winning a game is the only fun part of the game. Fuck the haters
---
I like semi better because it saves ammo , more damage pr shot.
---
I was so confused when this happened. I did not realize there were different types and thought I would be attacked but wasn't. Lol. It was cool though.
---
Grognak Axe still doesn’t get the 200% repair, please add this
---
That’s great news, I haven’t been using it any more because it crashed my game far too many times. If I ever get bored with melee I may have to switch back to my first character and try it out!
---
\+1 Baa noises.
---
Does "next update" mean:
---
4/16 Burrows
---
4/23 Camera
---
5/7 Pioneer Scouts
---
You get the recipe automatically once you get the raw flux of the type required.
---
Have you used the red computer in the bunker for the self-promotion? It will then redirect you to the SGT and he should dispense another certificate.
---
Yeah I since looked at it since the servers came back up. It adds accuracy of like 1 lol but also it "improves aiming focus" or something like that. I think what that means is it will reduce FOV and zoom a bit more when you use ADS. Which is good enough IMO.
---
I got a Mothman Funko Pop! 👍
---
(sorry for the delayed response!)  
---
Good to know, will document and report.
---
This is why I carry nukashine with me. Im tired of finding myself facing 3 lvl 80 SB.
---
Just FYI you camp budget doesn't increase with level. The reason higher level players have better camps is that we have found more plans for stuff that takes up less budget, eg the Fusion Generator is much cheaper as a percentage than loads of Large Generators.
---
Was it late  for you?
---
Correct. Its 10 of each I think, so youd need all 10 available I believe, yea?
---
Thanks for posting this!
---
What about if the "play game" box, was in the top left corner of the "news arrangement", and already selected at the default. That way, you could still click like crazy to just go play, or stop at the screen and scroll right or down to read news..
---
Really glad you like it and I like that suggestion, too!
---
Big boy statue!
---
Which wasn't my point, my point is how much stuff has been or is in the shop that we had in fallout 4 they are essentially selling it back to use with no work done to it .
---
I wish had money so I could award you gold😂

I'm not sure if i would pay a sub fee for 76 but i would definiately give them money for more storage maybe a one time fee of like 10 bucks or something
---
Right? Everyone complains about not getting loot, when literally all you have to do is hit it once.
---
I think the recipe appears in your list once you have just one.  But the OP probably did Whitespring Nuke zones which don’t have much if any violet flux available.  Probably why they only have the four in their list.  Fissure Prime has a lot of Violet Flux.

I'm usually on around 7:30 pm EST.

Am I the only one hearing Eddie Izzard in her head doing his "Flag" routine???
---
That does sound bad.  Hope whatever caused it is remedied soon.
---
I appreciate this answer. Thank you. I have been enjoying 76 "as-is," I just noticed it was getting sillier. I would like a single player game again, with a dark plot and horrible outcomes... maybe less base building and more weapon/armor/survival focus.
---
Let me know if it lets you restart it, curious!
---
Ditto they were white, even after attacking me
---
Meh, I'm pretty sure they just messed it up. No sentient translator would ever end up with that name by his own will.
---
416 hours so far.
---
Thanks, will Document and report!
---
If you don't think microtransactions that can also be earned in game doesn't involve trickery from developers than you're blind sorry.
---
2* = 80% more crafted ammo
---
3* = super duper has a 30% chance to double crafted anything
---
So with 5mm you would get 180 a craft with the chance for 360 a craft.
---
.308 goes from 12 to 22 with a chance at 44 per craft
---
I thought everyone loved fire works.
---
😂 too good
---
Original comment was mainly facetious mixed with a little smartass... however, they boasted about an "all new" lighting system when I feel the original was just fine imo so why fix something that was not broken I guess.
---
lol I'm like, Yeah! and then realize you're you.
---
I feel like I am the only one who prefers cash shops to sell mostly useless boosts like xp or repair kits over putting all the cool cosmetics in it. I couldn't care less if people are paying to repair their gear or to get extra xp when it is plenty easy to do just playing, but I love cool cosmetics and having to pay real money for most of them is irritating. I like when someone looks really cool and when you ask how they got it it is something like the x-01 quantum paint instead of just "cash shop"
---
Thanks for clarifying, that doesn’t seem problematic at all. I did end up buying the game and I can’t wait to play.
---
I agree, but I gotta ask? "How much you charge me to write a letter to my ex?"
---
Combat challenge robot kills.
---
Crafting it. 
---
With ammosmith maxed and super duper perks, you can craft hundreds of ammo at a time.
---
That's how I get the majority of my ammo. I still get a fair amount in containers (sometimes I put on the perk that can make you find more) but the majority I craft.
---
Cool, I’ll be online soon so I’ll give you a list of general perks you’ll need as well as those for a pa build.
---
Worst part is when server lag makes the "ding" and notification icon show up 20 seconds after the search, when you're back in a firefight. D'ohhhhh
---
All.the.time.
---
I often see the super mutant sawmill in the northwes t marked as nuked instead of WS, too.
---
This hasn't been happening to me, but it definitely happens to my Wife while we are playing together (both on PC). I can watch (on her screen so no lag between clients) as her hits pass right through everything. It is extremely bad in some situations, even worse when it happens repeatedly with 95% hit rate in VATS. It happened a very infrequently before this last patch, now it is roughly every 3rd encounter.
---
No mods for either of us.
---
Yeah, i learned how the event works a while ago. I love the way the quest works. Thanks for the comment tho :)
---
I'd just make it 100% of player level up to 100 caps. Who kills the lowlevels anyway
---
PC daaaaaawg
---
Every vendor
---
be aware of the requirement to have PS+ (or the MS equivalent) in order to play.
---
I was hesitant as well, given bad press I was reading + the PS+ requirement.
---
But glad I ignored it.  Yea, game has it quirks, but still well worth what I paid for it.
---
I thought I was the only one. Thanks op
---
Sick. You don't have my issue of needing every perk maxed out and having a having a shit build because of it. OCD BABEY!!
---
It's just like in Portal, "There will be cake and you will be baked!" . Not one time in that game did those robots have cake!
---
It’s like ee cummings on acid.
---
I was thinking of dropping nocturnal and putting points in something else honestly. Wasn’t really sure about Barbarian tbh.  Not sure about all the extra strength.
---
By next update, do you mean the 4/16 Burrows or 4/23 Camera or 5/7 Pioneer Scouts update?
---
Uhhh... what?
---
It goes up to 3 stars. Each level is 10% more change to make a dupe of whatever you are crafting (not Bulking stuff, but pretty much everything else).
---
I'd like to see something like a HAM radio feature where you build a radio antenna at your base and then can talk to other players who are on their radios.
---
This is great news yes, however, during “Bots On Parade” event, the enemies dont show up as hostile to start with. So vats wont work until youve picked a fight first.
---
This guy has no idea what he’s talking about. Hell, I have no idea what he’s talking about. But no, not really.
---
Well it is Survival...
---
Can you list your perk cards for me or look at my stats above and see if it's my build
---
Check out this vid if you're interested in where to possibly Nuke for Flux... I haven't done it myself yet so I can't confirm this is true but he has done a decent amount of research/testing on his channel.
---
https://youtu.be/saHaGl2D_JI
---
The few small cap bounties I killed was cause they directly stole from the supplies I had called for. I wouldn't even mind if they let me have first pick (I usually don't even want most to all the stuff in it), I just really object to them coming in and makign sure to take all before I can even get something.  Last one I killed I took his junk just to make a point even  as he took my friend's first attempt and my friend was very disappointed in losing it (and got rewarded with 22 ballistic pieces for that which I'll take over the caps).
---
Absolutely, We are a friendly PVE group and would welcome any mature players.
---
This is new with the latest patch, you can do it with all armor and weapons now ;) (40-50 max custom names)
---
If you want to, yes. If not, no.
---
Ok, that is where the problem lay atm, the Class Freak bug is back :(
---
Lol, expected the summary to be "I hate it" but glad you like it, what'd you pay?
---
If you liked FO4 buy it, you'll enjoy, otherwise save your money for other stuff, or buy it anyway and don't play it, its your money.
---
I haven't played since before the nerf to two shot weapons. How badly were they nerfed?
---
Good guess :D Yes i did nuke Whitersprings and got the other recipes but thought i also got atleast one Violet flux, but apparently not. What other fluxses does Fissure Prime offer? I'm planning on upgrading my Gauss rifle to the Ultracite version and also to make ammo for it, if i'm not mistaken it needs violet and crimson flux? Maybe cobalt..?
---
Throwing weapons can’t fire in vats. 
---
Was thinking of moving to lever after level 25. The hunting is just the best I have atm. 
---
I prefer the crossbow dits the theme and build. There should be a few mods BETHESDA!
---
Well not planning on renaming any guns so I'm fine with the power armour for now until they up the limit
---
you can look for yourself, i'm not your babysitter.
---
It is nothing like Destiny what so ever. If you like a good pvp experience and running around with barely any direction in Fallout game you will enjoy it a lot. Te base building is great and the grind is not necessary so just play it. No reason not to.
---
\*nod\* the likely changed that to avoid the "double glove" issue some outfits were having, I'd put this under QoL and will try and post it once the bug roundup is done
---
Reason I'm still playing it everyday I can.
---
There's no real choices yet, that's coming down the road though... So yes, you uncover the lore and story as you play. And it's not spoon fed to you for the most part, you need to piece it together if you want to understand exactly what happened.  I play this game solo and I love it... The only thing you really need other people to do is the final boss fight, but you won't have trouble getting help for that. And you'll probably need help for the new event that dropped this week, but I'm not sure how that one works as I haven't done it yet.
---
So i’ll because I want you to cite your references I’m a bad guy? And you’re a babysitter? I asked you to provide evidence for the point you’re trying to make
---
Get your excavator armor and go mining for lead and steel; supplement with using the extra cargo capacity of that PA to hoard weapons for even more steel. Craft ammo with Ammosmith and Super Duper.
---
Every patch goes the same way- everything seems to be running smoother than ever, then the patch hits and it’s all janky again, but incrementally things seem to get more and more stable again, as if little bits of the update activate over time. Idk, maybe it’s a bug testing protocol that lets them observe how things break and change bit by bit. Only Beth knows how their updates works. A lot get updated at once but it doesn’t seem to all click together except over time.
---
Best bet is if you do, join a group, I've got a bunch of guys and we run a BoS clan. We make content for players that are lore based, run operations, work new content into operations so you always have people to do stuff with. That is the best way to play this game, playing by yourself it can get stale. But I do really enjoy it and have since the beta days.
---
Are you kidding? Build yourself a porch and start sniping. Take poignant selfies with players' corpses flying through the air in the background. Turn up your Appalachia Radio to drown out the sounds of the carnage!
---
I’ll be glad to die at the TSE of a 
---
Tinylegume 😳
---
Over at our fights there is no legendary armor just pure fists come on over !
---
7:30 pm PST admission is only 20 caps ;)
---
lol bud I'm right there with you I have over 900 hours now and have done probaly over 1000 events (ones that can drop rare clothing) and notta...
---
Did you get it yet?!
---
Thanks for the reply :) I thought that was the way  it worked, i got a bit confused for a moment since i thought that i already got atleast one raw violet flux but apparently didn't.
---
Here’s how I have so much 50cal to spare: low health max damage build that usually uses 5mm with an Instigating Gatling gun for most trash. 1-3 shots on everything but a SB/Mirelurk Queen/behemoth. 
---
So 1. I’m suuuper ammo efficient most of the time and 2. I save my 50cal ammo for queen fights.
---
Ammo Smith and super duper. Get steel quick by picking up steel items, ore, and scraping weapons like assault and combat rifles.  Assault drop 7 steel and combat I think is 6 steel.  They also have components like rubber and glass which I use to make marine tactical helms for caps.  Good sources of lead are cans, combination wrenches, weights and pencils.  If you're in a group it's best to farm all the silos especially with scrounger since the reactor area and corridors have lots of ammo cans. I usually get 2-3k of all ammo types in 4-5 hours. Im going to try to make some YouTube videos when im home on home time.
---
Sure
---
yea it's bugged for everyone bud
---
Yeah, it's a bitch tbh. The thing that cracks me up is that they still play Destiny 2 religiously. I personally don't like that game and won't play just because of the $180 price tag if you want the full game.
---
Just to clarify, I got the $100 version that had the 2 dlc access on release, then they release forsaken for $79.99 with access to "premium content" whenever that comes out. Talk about a rip off. I payed $80 for FO76 and already got 2 dlc and more to come. There will most likely be an expansion pack for this game come 2020 and my guess it will be sold for $40-$60 dollars. I would pay for that, and it would still be better than destiny 2 "premium content"
---
This post made me look like a madman on the bus.
---
Laughing so hard.
---
the queen loot is useless tho, lol i keep getting exterminator canes everytime so..
---
I posted something exactly like this a few days ago and it turns out it's a future atom shop item that actually looks pretty cool
---
ANDDDDDddddd the majority of the people that trash this game never even played it...
---
drats...
---
Hahaha Gary!
---
Adrenal Reaction actually triggers at 90% Health.
---
Seems like based on the reports Adrenal is having an inverse effect when paired with Class freak.
---
You can do 99% of it solo and the parts you can’t are events where other people will show up—at least for now, future raids may be different. 
---
As of now there aren’t any narrative choices to make, it’s all about exploring and discovering lore and stories. There is a very well constructed story, but it’s made up of lots of little things, many of which you’ll need to actively seek out and explore to find. 
---
If you’re a Fallout fan, you’ll find plenty to like, though you may miss some things that aren’t there.
---
This is true in many cases. A minor annoyance in exchange for the ability to pick hostile targets on the first try in a big fight. In this situation I just aim-shot one to get the ball rolling
---
thank you very much for your reply, it is appreciated!
---
I‘d really like to know, what causes these problems and why the experiences vary this much. I don’t really have problems and I‘m on PS4 as well. I have no technical background and have no idea why some have major problems and others habe none at all.
---
In some ways, yeah, worse. What I’ve found is that they’re really requiring server hopping if you want any chance of actually completing them. And even then, especially the event based ones, it can be a massive PITA. I probably spent a couple hours last night trying to get the lighthouse quest- the first time I found it, it had 3 minutes left. Not enough time. Just barely managed to finish it the second time I found it, and about 4 other folks showed up in the last 3 minutes, clearly trying to find it as well. 
---
I did get distracted in between though, I think I caught 2 or 3 Sheepsquatch events while I was hopping. So that worked out.
---
I would go for that. Deathclaws are my favorite fallout enemy and I'd totally like to see them get one over the scorchbeast queen :).   
---
(I'm still pissed they killed the intelligent deathclaws in 2. F you Enclave).
---
I mass produced Alcohol and fusion Cors
---
In fallout, the leather provides energy res by what I'm assuming is heat spreading out into armor. Metal is a conductor of heat, while leather isnt.
---
On PC, only know a couple of guys who have them stocked in market76. They switched to trade only. Was 6k for awhile, then 8k. I haven't seen them sell for 2.
---
I've often wondered what the effect will be on our community if people start piling into the game.
---
after level 45..they are a piece of cake
---
The abandon quest is a solid idea....  
---
How would you keep people from exploiting a longer questline?
---
nope no issue, I don't like pvp., i have issues with the griefers.
---
This was well written and super informative. Kudos to you for spending time I couldn't imagine doing.
---
Anti armour is quite good. Have you got the automatic receiver? It's super cool looking and turns it into a complete beast in vats.
---
Things that are a pain for me include AOE damage, traps, radiation.   If they would include more elements like these it would discourage my type of build... I will always min max my build, I think that is human nature.
---
I can craft it on only one of my characters, I’ll buy the plan if you have it (:
---
Follow up question, why are there some unspecified mods? I found a vendor selling calibrated shocks with no PA model noted, but they don’t seem to attach to any model?
---
Thanks, I didn’t have any idea it would get this big but it is a feature I’d love to see. I’d love to retake pictures I have IRL and put them in my camp ingame.
---
I hope you enjoy it, I have a blast playing it, and the PC community is super chill thanks to fortnite taking all the little shits away from our playing experience.
---
Log on.
---
Check Atom Shop.
---
Load in.
---
Do daily and weekly challenges if I can actually do them.
---
Claim all 3 fusion core workshops, because I sell fusion cores, and kit them out. (Depends if I'm going to be on for a long time or not.)
---
Do my junk run for ballistic fibre, springs, screws, ECT.
---
Go to whitesprings and sell excess or any of the junk I just farmed.
---
Go to places with high amounts of enemies to murder, West tex, whitesprings, ect.
---
Go to cranberry bog, go to all fissure sites and murder all the scorchbeasts I see.
---
While doing all this look out for events and do them.
---
Maintaining my workshops, doing events when they pop up and my daily junk run keeps me very busy and resource rich. :)
---
Yes servers always have people playing. More people play the game then haters thinks. Also play on Pro :)
---
Hire bouncers
---
Well, I guess I will give up now. No way I am spending time to do 1000 events for nothing
---
You can check for yourself, again, I'm not your babysitter, why do I have to prove to a complete stranger? I mean I don't need to cause I don't need you or have an interest to get to know you, bye xo
---
have you removed them from favorites and re-added?  
---
Was able to use both in and out of Power Armor
---
same. for me it's just fun.
---
Up
---
Youre a real nice guy xoxo buddy
---
[PS4] I see a lot of people on every server when I play
---
And citing sources as well you know how to prove your point
---
git gud or go back to the sims
---
It’s fine if players dislike fallout 76. It’s definitely not a game for everyone. I was one of the hate crowds who hated the game when I bought it. I still don’t believe it was worth 60$, but it’s a decent fallout game. I was coming off fallout 4 at the time so I didn’t understand all these crazy systems: diseases, thirst, hunger, and repair. The holo tapes and paragraph notes also didn’t help since I was use to voice acting.
---
Same! Plenty of daily players. Worth getting in my opinion.
---
Nice, it was driving me crazy not being able to find a way to craft it. Thanks &amp; I'm pretty sure I saw a data mined photo of it too somewhere as well.
---
Oh no someone is using all the resources they have available
---
Most likely server issues and no one really knows how they do their servers. Obviously, there is some partition or separate servers because my game is literally the worst its been since launch.
---
There are fireflies all over at the random small creature spots. Also there's a spot up north-west that has 8 every time. 
---
I totally agree about the event ones, though. I don't think I've ever even seen a Path of Enlightenment.
---
Not sure what would be worth exploiting, none of the items save All-Rise is really awesome and it is last phase reward.
---
My main/first post-BETA character is HW/explosives and PA. I’ve transitioned him into being a full low health build as it’s just so beneficial. 
---
Primary weapon is an Instigating 25% fire rate Gatling gun (cant decide between it and a bloodied Gatling gun; if I found a bloodied 25% fire rate I’d be all over it) but I’ve got a bloody 50cal for big beasts. 
---
My second is a full stealth vats sniper. 1 str, 1 endurance. Also low health build. Primary weapon is a bloody lever action. 
---
Leveling a new Unarmed character. Trying not to go low health, more of a non-PA tank build. Have an Instigating power fist I intend to use once I hit 50. I’d love an upgraded one with swing speed.
---
My math is shaky, but I want to say the nerf resulted in them doing about 64% less damage for TSE. (Because of the two shot attribute, each bullet also causes two explosions... thus 64% reduction rather than 52%)
---
TS by itself was reduced 75%. (From 100% weapon damage for the extra shot to only 25%)
---
Explosive was reduced 80%. (Again, from 100% weapon damage for the explosive damage to just 20%)
---
K Ima be honest that is the stupidest shit I have ever heard of.
---
I would love a Mr Fuzzy bear
---
Lol yah same here I literally though I was going crazy bc I couldn't  find it in my crafting station
---
TM -01 station near Harper Ferry, might need to hop a few times

Capture 2 workshops in the mire and wait for defense events
---
Big Maw: look down to the well, could get one
---
Graham is great. I followed him around the other day as his bodyguard, listening to him talk to Chally about several different things. He talked about making enough caps and then moving somewhere peaceful, talking about a guy he called Smarty. He's just a great character.
---
That's a good fight underwear fights are the most honest fights!
---
Thank you so much! :)
---
It can be super handy for inventory sorting. Rename all your guns “- lever action” will put them at the top of the list (or like “z lever action” would put them at the bottom”)
---
I liked it at first, but I got pretty bored of it eventually. It just starts to feel very samey. I don't think it's as bad as a lot of people say, but I can't blame anyone for not liking it.
---
They are absolutely more difficult/tedious. They would rather you pay for more Atoms than get them for free.
---
Not at all. The player base on PS4 all do exploit glitches and shit it's dumb.
---
Praise RNGesus and he shall deliver.
---
Yeah, I exit out after every repair and go back in to see the details.
---
Thank you!!
---
It adds additional damage over time, on top of damage listed and any additional buffs onsaid weapon.
---
I'm n1 mostly and right now ^^
---
Artillery anyone?
---
I hunt down keycards and give them away.
---
Farm ticks and make 100+ stimpaks. Use what I need, give extras away.
---
Plant a lot of crops for others.
---
Server hop for Uranium Fever.
---
Run around in nuke zones like a lunatic and collect flux so I can stabilize it and then give away to others.
---
Do Powering Poseidon, immediately claim workshop, power up fusion core gen, make a couple benches and a stash box and then sign out before I'm murdered (but after I defend it once and get one or two cores) This way when I sign out someone else just has to claim and doesn't need to spend so much on crafting.  (I sometimes will do this ten times in a row server hopping so ten servers have working fusion core gennies and just need to be claimed.)
---
Leave unwanted plans/items in blue suitcases at stations or the ice cooler at WhiteSprings.
---
Make Marine Wetsuits and leave in a paper bag at WhiteSprings in workstation area.
---
Draw ghouls at the golf club out and crouch down letting them hit me while lower levels get to kill them and get rewards but no damage. 
---
Run around fixing things for others at events I'm passing through (like ASAMs) because I have a lot of steel from doing Point Pleasant runs and collecting every golf club and coat hanger I see.
---
Collect all fusion cores at Mount Blair and drop off at Morgantown or Charleston station. Or use for myself if I need. I go through 20 fusion cores a week so I only keep what I need, give rest away.
---
Make a redunculous amount of Nuka Grenades and give some away but use the rest on Grafton Monsters and Deathclaws.
---
Walk around staring at the sky.
---
Climb to the top of things and jump to my non death while my stomach flips watching my monitor.
---
Stimpak fallen players if I encounter them.
---
Unequip Starched Genes, pop Radaways until all my mutations are gone, get naked and run screaming into Hemlock Holes to get new round of mutations. Then server hop, repeat.
---
Give away all Disease Cures because the Sulphur water fountain cures diseases one by one.
---
If I accidentally level-scale an area and a lower level is there and gets trapped by my mistake, destroy all the enemies and leave a paper bag with everything dropped plus extra for their trouble. This includes legendaries. I have a rule. If by my incompetence I cause trouble, I drop everything I gained from the area.
---
Make Mothman omelettes for others.
---
I'm very "shy" so I don't team up with others but I spend 90% of my time trying to think of others and doing what I can to help out. So I don't accept friend/team invites but will absolutely pitch in if needed in a pinch or just try to offer what I can so others feel like this is a great game they can continue to play for a long time.
---
Fallout 3 saved my sanity and got me through my stepfather's death. As a result this franchise is very special to me.
---
I want it to last and not to become toxic like other gaming communities.
---
Anyway I'm level 157, name tararynieyn on PC.
---
If you ever need an area cleared or need me to sit there while you dump ammo into an enemy, I'm your gal. 
---
Need something you can't get because the area is too high for you or need help in some other way, message me here on Reddit, state your request and I'll see if I can assist you in any way.
---
And if you see a Marine Wetsuit in a blue suitcase somewhere, it's probably a gift made with love from me. Wear it in my name and be safe out there in the wasteland. :)
---
Oh yeah whether you’re a spectator or a fighter everyone leaves a winner ! 
---
Doesn’t 500 caps seem silly for admission ??
---
the reward system on this game is really shitty, like I keep getting brass knuckles and/or legendary canes, lol, I've seen better reward system in minecraft than this game.
---
This game makes it the easiest for "victims" of "griefers". I can't really even call them "griefers" because the result of their "destruction" is at best a minor inconvenience. In other survival/open world MMOs, like Conan or Ark or even Minecraft, the result of being fucked with is real. Your materials are lost and there is no blueprint. It is gone and must be rebuilt. Your items, all of them, are taken. Repairing the structures (at a discount of the original price) and not having to re-place the blocks just isn't an option in other PVP survival environments. You lose what I'd consider, and most would, a very minor amount of items. 
---
So I guess I really don't see what your problem is. Even if you think they're roleplaying wrong, or just being dicks. It's a very minor inconvenience to you.
---
I played it for a couple weeks at launch. No terrible stories like what you hear from everyone else, and I had some fun with it, but unfortunately I found the world lacked that interaction that I loved so much from previous fallout titles. It just didn’t hook me in. 
---
Maybe it’s the lack of any kind of NPC interactions or choices, even turning in quests to robots and merchants is just a one button thing with no dialog. It just feels a bit hallow after a while.
---
I still like to pop in every now and then, but it hasn’t hooked me like I was expecting yet.
---
Same problem!
---
Yea because that's what everyone was looking for in the post apocalyptic wasteland.
---
A newbie friendly paradise where everyone walks around being nice and picking flowers. It's supposed to be like club penguin with radiation.
---
Fo76 is not a bad game. Its lacking in some areas and has lots of bugs, but at the end of the day its really fun to play especially with friends
---
A little over 400 hours.

---
I don't get it. There are so many fantastic games to play now, that you are doing yourself a disservice being so negative all the time
---
Thanks :) I'll be sure to check that out.
---
I have had my best results on Friday and Saturday. Don’t know if player volume affects the drops, but busy days for me yield better drops.
---
Idk what naterox is talking about. I frequently see people helping others, leaving junk mats in random places for people to find. Or even waiting just outside vault 76 for newbies to pop out, just to shower them with random goodies to start their adventure. I'm part of a rp bos group and always have people around if I'm looking to adventure
---
That's incredibly flattering, appreciate it!
---
It’s not that commonly used, but there’s a legendary effect that has a fairly good poison resistance buff, I want more poison damage in the game too, but I hope they’d be buffed a bit for them.
---
I use an Instigating Super Sledge, which deals insane initial damage and excellent continuing damage with each hit.
---
I'll bring the molotovs, you throw
---
I'm pretty sure I saw the Targeting Computer mod at BoS Watoga a couple days ago, and it was noteworthy because I'm not sure if I had ever seen it before.
---
Just terrifying.
---
I play all the time, the people that say it's trash are the ones that can't get away with stuff. I play with my friends. I play a lot, have 3 characters and on PS4. Hit me up if you need help or company.

Good stuff, lmfao.

Just buy the game. It's dirt cheap and most of the opinions are highly biased on here. If you like fallout, buy it

whoa! we got an internet tough guy over here!

Tbh my mic died before i had the game and i don't have much money and no friends to play with so i haven't bought another mic so i didn't add anyone cause i have no mic. Sorry :/

Sorry for the  grammar im french =)

AGL = agility perk cards.

So after the recent server side update. Tse weapons now show correctly but you need to have a bloodied weapon equipped in order to see it's true damage. Once you do all bloodied weapons show the correct damage. Tse weapons are so far staying the same either way now.
---
I think so. My friends and I play a lot on PS4.

that is up for debate

Yeah that’s pretty rad.
---
How is there a huge disadvantage to using power armor? The damage resistances on power armor are so insanely high that builds that continue it have to rely on cheesy tactics to survive.

Same. When OP suggested it just use acid I got spooked. Between uranium ore, ammo, and lemonade I'm perpetually low on acid.
---
I have my camp on the edge of a steam near the pond with the acid spring in it.  I leave it opened and welcome to all the passerbys going to silo alpha or pleasant valley ski resort.  When my team was in we used to meet up to prep for nuke launches.  Now anyone that stumbles upon it does the same. I have plenty of purified water and food for those that visit.  
---
Last weekend I had a group attack me when I was making stims so I blew up most of my own camp with mini nukes and annoyed them for hours by repeatedly destroying their camps :) so much fun.  So if anyone attacks me I have 60+ mini nukes with my two shot fat man ready to go.
---
Considering that 6 months after launch we still have techncial data...
---
My problem is not that diseases are in the game, its that everywhere I look theres a damn roach somewhere or monster that is diseased, and yes, 90% infection rate
---
Yup we care so much more for this post than all the other 20 odd this week. Stop whining
---
I'll keep a better eye out. Thank you!
---
Log in. Putter around a bit. Consider completing "I am Become Death" this weekend, farm Watoga/Whitesprings, server hop looking for an X01 Jetpack mod, brew more Nukashine. then decide on drinking or giving it to a fresh level 2.
---
Maybe do an event. Decide it's time for bed. Go to bed. Get up. Go to work. Come home. Eat. Repeat.
---
it used to be a role playing game, not really sure what it is now
---
Max out shotgun perks plus bloody mess, demo expert, and scattershot.
---
My friend that I play with has a build with sneak that uses a gauss rifle. All he dies in that event is sneak on top of the cabin and kill all the minion robots. It is a huge help.
---
600 ish, level 243 and 82 character
---
I hear that. Right around the 850th event I broke down and bought the BOS Jumpsuit : -0
---
There’s a small pop up that shows on the left side of the screen says encrypted event or something like that although easy to miss amid action
---
The ability to assign your own custom names was added in the last patch.

Hey, thanks - appreciate it. A bit long but whatevs, there was a lot to cover.

Tried it yesterday and was one of the few people who actually activated pylons......we failed and then some of the assholes in the group started shooting at me unprovoked. I left to rest at my camp and got up to put dinner in microwave...one of those douchbags followed me and blew up my camp.
---
Idk what's up with these morons. Just follow the quest instructions and don't be a dick. Idk if they thought it was my fault or something??
---
Awesome bro. Lots to see and lots to do. Has the best player base ever, at least for Adventure mode. Survival mode is the real PVP of the game, which I currently don't even play haha
---
That's your computer, many people don't have that problem. Stop spewing bs
---
I learned my lesson the first time I hit that event. Don't bring any junk with sorry. Sorry bro. 🤷‍♂️
---
Yep. The exhaust is a rainbow. So you have to find it at the end of a rad-rainbow.
---
There ya go.  Personally I'd say it's WAY better than launch.  
---
It still has bugs and flaws but it's come a long way and a bunch of new content and features are coming soon so now's as good a time as any to hop back into the game.
---
Purifiers only make water at one rate. Doesn't matter how many you have. The only difference having multiple makes is the amount of water they can store for you while being away from camp.
---
Hello. I run bloodied buzz blade + limb damage  for queen. If u don't like bloodied style because dying is not fun, like me. Alternatively I run full hp and use furious buzz blade with limb damage and switch to executioner buzz blade when sbq is below 40% hp.  I use executioner +ss sledgehammer on adds during sbq fight. Better usefulness instead of killing adds, use enforcer perk plus shotgun to ground the queen.
---
Tried it last night for the first time. Started the event and maybe shot a few gutsies and BAM... Disconnected from the server. You think they would fix this issue by now. 
---
So, no I don't plan on doing it again. I don't care about outfits and camp decorations.
---
See you used all yours to write that reply! Now put them same effort in fallout and you’ll be good
---
I hate that thing. "DO YOU WANT TO VISIT THE ATOM SHOP? VISIT THE ATOM SHOP! OH DID WE CTD YOUR GAME? SORRY! HEY, HOW ABOUT THAT ATOM SHOP THO??!?!?!?"
---
Fuuuuuuuuck.
---
So how many BOS combat armor plans did you see?  Didn’t note that on the sheet but I’m on a cell phone
---
Not sure anything has actually changed, but the way PA frames display in the menus kinda eludes to the ability to modify them. I'd have to set down in game and try and recall exactly what leads me to think that, but I'm certain they've been set up in a fashion that would allow mods regardless if they were ultimately intended to do so.
---
what, like a 10HP loss? lol I didn't even notice
---
The acid soaker, and the nuka cola spray gun. I'm pretty sure I remember seeing the water gun ammo in ammo crates when people accessed the dev room, so it's at least in the files.
---
Thing is, they would have to make those items useful. The syringer is useless in this game, the only barrel that even remotely provides a benefit is the endangerol one. The radscorpion venom barrel, which by the way is RIDICULOUSLY hard to get enough stingers to make, is so trash that it can't even kill a level 6 scorched in one hit. Same thing with the paddle ball, it's a nice meme but completely worthless. Apparently you can scrap them to learn mods that are somewhat useful, but I haven't ever been able to find anybody willing to sell them and I sure as hell can't grind out hundreds of tokens to try it
---
Agreed here also on that ! 👍
---
Yes, perk doesn't need to always be applied just because you level up. By that I mean, certain perk cards are opened at certain levels. Decide how you like to play, ask the community if that's a viable build. Test your builds on [nukesdragons.com](https://nukesdragons.com) as you can add and remove what you like. Once done it will tell you what level to apply them.
---
Other tips:
---
\- pick up everything and scrap it put it in your stash
---
\- playing with others can help you level up quickly
---
\- sleep to get extra XP
---
\- visit Whitespring golf course and find the fountain that can cure diseases
---
\- get a hazmat suit asap
---
\- connect to friends games and fast travel to them to find new locations
---
There is a lot to know. If you need help let me know.

Are you on PC? I seen some pyjama clad person in Lewisburg last night fighting muties with me.

 It's possible he was hacking. I ran into 2 players yesterday killing people without pvp active. It was more obvious because they were lv0-5.

They're giving you free missiles and all you do is hate, sad.

Ive noticed that as well
---
I'm with you until the second paragraph. What's the point of posting and never replying?

Anyway, I had no idea it was *10* acid. That's nuts. It costs 5 jhst to smelt nuclear material. Does Ammosmith help?
---
I wanted to take Friendly Fire but found ammo so rare it wasn't worth it.
---
but why can people touch my stuff in the first place.
---
i get if it been left for awhile fine but the damn sheepsquatch kill everyone in 1 hit.
---
people shouldnt be able to do that.
---
Having a more than 1 only increase capacity.
---
Good lord.  I guess at least it's a simple work around for this bug then.
---
Ty for the fix though.  I'll try it again tonight since I try to have that workshop everytime I play for a few hours.
---
You said "slight chance." Probably only drops a 1* wood piece anyway lol
---
&gt;Idk why many people consider contesting a workshop in adventure as griefing
---
If I'm at my workshop and you come to contest it, game on, but most of the time what seems to happen is that teams will find you on the map, one will fast travel to wherever you are while the other heads to your workshop, and then they gank you when you're standing around in your camp making soup. THAT is griefing, and I doubt it's the way they intended the mechanic to work. 
---
There's a relatively easy way to fix the system:
---
* player 1 claims workshop and then goes off to do something while resources are collected
---
* player 2 travels to workshop and begins to contest it. 
---
* player 1 has 1 minute (or whatever the contesting timer is) to return to the workshop if they wish to defend it.
---
* If player 1 returns to the workshop they become open to map-wide PvP, but if they ignore the warning then player 2 gets the workshop and no PvP is initiated.
---
This allows people to defend and try to retain their workshop if they're heavily invested in keeping it, while allowing people who just wanted to claim it as a fast travel point (or to collect plans from the events) to relinquish control without opening themselves up to PvP or server hopping to get rid of it.

It's one of those things where I'll participate when I can, but I wouldn't go out of the way to activate it myself because of the cost.
---
I wish they had more weapons like the deliverer from fallout 4 where you can't get the type of weapon other than through that quest
---
Nah I never said the it's bs some people can't run it (although the vast majority can) its bs that your 2 year old can make a game. You might wanna pop a tampon in whilst you're at it
---
you died. you dropped it.
---
Transfer legendaries to my mules and long for the legendary vendor.

he wasnt killing people though he was just waiting till they died and took their stuff. he didnt damage the sheepsquatch or do pylon just ran around taking stuff.
---
Crap! No wonder the #1 guy got to me unseen when I was #2 and looking out for him on my map... I thought he was dead or something then all of a sudden he had me!
---
Fireworks?
---
Idk Abut your kids or you as a 2 year old. But last time I checked my kid and most kids don’t swear shit on the walls. By the looks of it looks like you did.

Lmao. You get it.

Gnarled Shadows north east corner of the map always has them.

A skin for the flare gun that shoots pretty fireworks and firework themed atomic stuff like firework/American PA paint and weapon skins

Yay like a weapon that shots fireworks
---
If I'm reposting it to get more people so far we have about eight
---
Thanks very much!
---
Great work!
---
Patience. Game development isn't easy.
---
Correct.  Not at all what I'm talking about though.  I'm talking about the unique, named, variants of the existing weapons.  They come pre-loaded with their own special names...and occasionally with mods or effects, that basically dont exist otherwise.  Although by that Criteria I guess not all of the existing ones actually count.  Any Anti-Armor .44 would replace the Summerset, and I know that Suppressors Flamers exist as well.  Some of them though, like the AP from the Civil Unrest and the HP from the All Rise, have no other in-game equivalent.  Most noteably the Bullets that make the target Catch Fire, from the Perfect Storm, Can't get THAT on anything else :-)
---
Well he was a 3*  and he ended up dropping me a bloodied shotgun.  So I couldn't really complain.      But I suppose that is just a special case
---
you dont have to be an ass, its obvious to all fans of bethesda that bethesda is going to bork up updates and create new problems with each patch.  this has been going on for many many moons
---
Vault Boy and Dogmeat are still more iconic.
---
Debuffs wont change how many perk points you can have in that SPECIAL stat, but they will reduce your proficiency with anything governed by that stat.
---
Strength debuffs will reduce your carry weight, your attack damage with melee weapons and a few other related things. If skill checks where in the game they would also effect those. 
---
Perception debuffs will negatively effect VATS accuracy and accuracy with weapons in general, though it’s not as notable in modern fallouts.
---
Endurance debuffs will directly effect your max health, I’m not sure what else. 
---
Charisma debuffs effect your bartering prices and how high of a perk card rank you can share (I have 6 charisma so I can share 2 star cards, if I get even a -1 charisma debuff it removes my shared card and I can’t share it until I take care of the debuff) they may also factor into pacification attempts.
---
Intelligence debuffs will effect the experience you get from completing objectives or getting kills.
---
Agility Debuffs will effect AP regen, speed, reloading etc. anything that has to do with how nimble and coordinated your character is. 
---
Luck debuffs will effect your critical rate gain and a few RNG items in the world like gaining a perfectly preserved pie.
---
Pls tell me ur joking
---
Yay and maybe and event to go along with it with different rewards
---
I don't remember ever needing a plan for ultracite ammo. You may need to have unlocked the ultracite receiver for the weapon to craft it.
---
Good to hear a good drop happens from time to time.
---
yes
---
Yup there are players going to that event just to farm lunch bags sad to say
---
I don't think any of the "rare clothing" events are the same ones that give you brotherhood stuff
---
Yah.    Every extra is a good extra
---
I got my first Prime receiver yesterday, and would love for someone to tell me the difference between regular ammo and ultracite ammo.
---
*here human, human, human...*
---
I have posted it several times in an effort to get as many fighters as possible some people are willing to commit to something several days ahead of time and some don't know what they're going to be doing until that day. This is a ton of fun and you are welcome to join.
---
Yup I host the original fallout fight nights and don’t charge you outrageous prices to compete. Hit me up I’d love to work with you
---
No.  The people in the resort stayed there after the great war until the bots started a pre-programmed renovation of the hotel.  At which point the bots were programmed to "forcefully evict" everyone.
---
One person stayed at the hotel, knowing the bots would kill him.  The rest packed up all the supplies they could carry and left.  It's not completely clear where they went, other than "not there".
---
IMO it's a little odd they didn't try to set up a camp just off the property, so that they could move back in when the renovation was done.  I'm also not a fan of "they became raiders", because the wealthy socialites saying "Oh, the government will come save us" after the bombs fell aren't exactly going to have sufficient drive to start raiding everyone else.  But that's not the story Bethesda wanted to tell.
---
Always make sure to dump your junk off at your camp before heading to the event. The first minute or 2 of it is standing around for the sheepsquatch to spawn anyway.
---
Something to do with Liberty Prime! Miss that guy.
---
&gt; And on top of the impastasquatch seemingly targeting me over the others,
---
I'm pretty sure that's an intended mechanic. Every time I become a conduit I jump on top of the shed so that she can't give me the fisto treatment.
---
Hey, I don't have a set price per-say, so I'm willing to hear what you're willing to offer for it, be it caps, or trading for something else.
---
Are you guys also investigating the
---
Heavy plasma/laser gatling bug too? They are new bugs from the patch. For better clarification of what im talking about, you can only fore on round after a reload and have to respool everytime. But when you finally do get your firing going, if you have any partial cores, you will prematurely run empty and have to reload again. Rinse and repeat. 
---
Also side note is there any time frame when anti armor will work properly?
---
Lucky hole mine in an excavator gets you a buttload of lead.
---
Didn’t know idiots like you didn’t know what being sarcastic is. You might want to read a book whilst you’re at it
---
Yeah it's a stupid thought. For example i find baseball extremely boring, but i'm not going to actively tell them "it sucks, you should play this sport instead". Everyone enjoys different things, as long as they're not personally bothering you or doing something illegal just let them be.
---
^ what he said you have to have the prime receiver plan learned  to be able to craft ultracite ammo
---
Like a liberty prime poster or outfit
---
Just make sure you go into the event without any junk on you. You drop junk when you die in adventure mode, and unfortunately anyone can pick it up. It sucks, but it happens. Just stash your junk before going into the event or really any event
---
That’s the problem. People see bows. “Me hit, me good” no thought on strategy.
---
I have a similar build. Look into Blocker and Ironclad that should help. Also the mutations Adrenal Reaction, Talons, and Twisted Muscles. 
---
Also added ricochet to my build too.
---
Or you can pay. Don't police people's ways of playing. The game needs an economy.
---
Ok and thanks for the help:)
---
It's because the game's timeline is permanently frozen right at Halloween. They're just trick-or-treaters that were in the wrong place, at the wrong time.
---
I'm hoping for a comeback of npcs, i mean once the scorch threat is neutralized they should be back, raiders included.
---
"Raiders have a storied history in fallout, literally being one of the first groups one encounters from the outset of fallout 1. "
---
Well, arguably the first group you encountered was Radrats, but with their limited linguistic skills, they don't post here much, so I'll give you that point.
---
the ability to craft the ultracite ammo you need for the receiver follows the prime receiver plan, they drop from the SBQ but also sometimes from normal SB's.
---
If you buy a weapon with a prim already on it you will need someone to craft the ammo for you...
---
Statue would be awesome, as long as it's 1:1 scale.
---
It’s easy if you have teammates. I play the game mostly solo, so I have no problem paying a lot for them. Especially since it’s easier for me to get the caps in other ways. Different methods work for everyone.
---
So long as it's not 10k+, sure. That shit is a lot more common than people realize, it's definitely not rare
---
Hey, are you able to trade now?
---
That explains a lot, actually....
---
Whatever you do, don’t claim a workshop or shoot back at someone. If someone wrecks your camp, just move it a tiny bit to repair it for free

Not complaining, im talkin shit theres a difference. Doesnt matter what I say im gonna get downvoted, this sub is mainly people who do this anyways. Just wanted to let you all know how ass you are if you do this but team up on me anyways! Just like in game ;)
---
Basically. Luckily you get a notification when the event starts, though. I'm glad they added that for this event
---
I have an Executioner's Sledgehammer for when she's under half health which is pretty nice.  Up to that point though, I don't have an established weapon.  I have a Vampire Super Sledge with the swing speed bonus, but it's Level 40.
---
Ha! Are you on PC?
---
You didn't actually address my argument, you just insulted me. What's the "trickery"? Be specific. What was the "trick"? You're saying that all microtransactions that can also be earned in game involve trickery (e.g. deception). So what's the deception? You should be able to articulate EXACTLY where that is, otherwise you're precisely the problem I was referring to. Maybe think on that.
---
My line of thinking says now that players can customize weapon names, then theres no pressing/particular need for the Devs to do so.
---
Haven’t bought FO76 yet (nor do I remember subscribing here) but I’ve learned not to rely on reviews because I’ve loved some games which had bad reviews but also hated games with good reviews, I typically just check the game’s subreddit to see what the more dedicated players think about the game, as well as bugs/issues
---
Upgrade equipment, farm legendaries, farm Boss events, CAMP building, helping new players, Nukes, Sheep Boi, Queen, grind more perk cards.
---
Some people would rather pay instead of getting it themselfes. Just like real life. Which is up to them.
---
I paid for Quantum paint and I can sleep at night
---
You don't even need a team to complete it, just enough people from the server to join in on it. People asking for 10k+ for outfits that aren't rare are over pricing it, and that's just insane to me
---
The leveling experience is the only, almost, finished part of the game. lol
---
Liberty Prime standing under died Chines commies holding the American Flag with a famous quote of him in the bottom
---
Imo it needs to happen more often. And not the 3 hours it does now.
---
You shouldn't have to buy the plans again. 
---
What level are you? You should be able to hit the Fissure Prime spot when someone drops a nuke even if you're not a super high level.
---
I'm selling one for 9999 caps. It's under 10,000, so is that better? 😆
---
True! I just don't think it's right that people are selling them and legit trying to get 10k+ for stuff that's not even rare
---
I like your thinking
---
I could picture the Bloodied one working well, but I've heard that Buzz Blades (and Rippers for that matter) don't produce the damage you think they do because the health meter reflects the collective damage of everyone from the moment you start sawing, not how much your sawing actually does.
---
it's a mod issue, my wife had that issue. had to add some new stuff to the fallout76custom.ini to fix the issue. add the new "03" files to the custom file to fix it.
---
I literally lived about 10 feet away because there was a lead extractor there. For some reason I just decided to pick up and head to the mire right before this update... boy am I glad lol
---
Yes!!! This guy gets it!!! 😂
---
Great Idea!!!
---
There could be Legendary Effects on Power Armor pieces and/or on PA mods, and the effects could be some new one and some existing ones
---
* Also, it would be great if we could have a way to move those Legendary effects (or create them) with the appropriate new perks (which could have a chance of success etc) or trade them with the Purveyor for the effects we desire
---
* This would increase the viability of PA in PVP and in PVE and make a lot of PA build players very happy
---
* Example of a new PA mod / legendary Effect:
---
   * Forcefield: 50/75/100 HP field that absorbs damage (unaffected by Anti Armor) and slowly regenerates once diminished
---
   * Auto Repair: Nanobots slowly (out of combat) repair the PA (first the piece it is on, then the other pieces worn) to a max. of say 75% etc for piece it is on and 50% for other pieces (so there is still value for full repairs)
---
   * Regenerative Braking:  (Legs) When hitting the ground from a fall the power core is slightly regenerated from the kinetic energy of the impact (just like the brakes on electric vehicles).  So now instead of being annoyed at the pause graphic from a big jump/fall, we can benefit from it
---
   * Electromagnetic:  Turn the suit into a giant magnet, that will automatically pick up (into inventory) all metal junk / weapons that you come in close proximity of (It could be from containers/bags, or just loose items).  This is a scavengers dream to just run through a building and pick things up automatically.  Have ability to turn feature on/off.  This feature could potentially also allow players to “wall-walk” on metallic surfaces
---
   * Death Blossom:  When fully charged it creates a shockwave of energy to the immediate area (like 10 feet) causing significant damage (a meter must fully charge over time to enable this feature, so it can only be used 1 time every X minutes etc).  This could be used when you are surrounded by a horde of creatures in an emergency, or set to automatically go off when Health reaches X.
---
      * Could also have different Damage versions of this (type of damage / amount of damage etc)
---
   * Frickin Lasers on their Heads:  The Helmet now has an independent Laser (like the Assaultron) that would make Dr. Evil smile
---
Any other suggestions for Legendary Effects?
---
4/5 today we're easy as fuck.
---
If you're on XBox, I'd pay you for the Impostor Outfit. I'm not a huge fan of the event given the constant deaths and the fact that the game has crashed twice while doing it. However, I like the outfits.
---
YES this so much this
---
I’ve had bad luck and wasted over 6k in caps for the cards with no successes on servers when relying on strangers so far.  Hoping that changes over the weekend. We shall see.
---
Thanks! I'll be back on this afternoon around 3 pm CST - ing is same as screen name here.
---
I have some crap legendaries (just picked up a 1 star 2shot combat rifle today) and a bunch of extra alcohol recipes, or I'd give you some caps.  Anything in particular you're looking for?  Ammo, junk, etc?
---
I have been doing Enclave events for the questline, so far got the urban scout facemask and chest piece. Got them both since the patch on Tuesday.
---
This is wholesome, thank you for your services.
---
Same here. Just launched the new even and got disconnected. Won't be doing that again.
---
Its always like that. Its a trend. No one tought about AA when the trend was Two-Shot and fire rate it the new shit instead of explosive and so on.
---
Unfortunately, since the news popup "feature" is in Fallout76.exe, there's nothing for modders to try to help mod out.
---
I think the issues you're seeing is people have so many caps and nothing to spend them on. I over payed for the fixer plan just because I could. Found one later and sold it for a third of what I paid originally. Some people don't have the time or patience to mess around with a pug event that spawns once every three hours. They would much rather pay for convenience and that's their choice.
---
Drop the mats cost down by half.
---
This is great, though I too would be curious as to what plans dropped for you at what event.  Did you happen to record that info, or can provide info via memory?
---
Hard is good. I’ve run it three times, twice with my bloodied main and once with my lower level melee alt. Killed her every time. Knowing your role and contributing where you can is key. Take pylons, kill adds, res the fallen, kite her, something. Just don’t be the ones who do nothing but pick up loot bags. 
---
Bonus points if you help others find the corpse because we were busy elsewhere and didn’t see where she died, especially if it was in the pond.
---
I am on xbox, however I'm keeping this one. I like doing the event so if I happen to get another set of the imposter outfit, I'll sell it. But you won't catch me asking for 10k or more caps lol
---
I have a character who knows the plan. But that's it.
---
Sorry buddy, I played since the start of Beta and I never had any gamebreaking bugs or anything like that, only minor things like the player models looking large
---
Oof, I'm sorry :( that sucks ass man. Hopefully that does change
---
You're pointing to a small handful of uniques that drop from bosses, which do not represent 99.9% of the drops in Diablo. 
---
That's like saying Fallout 76 already features guaranteed drops because officers always drop Nuke Codes even though every other drop is RNG'd. 
---
For real guy. Go make an entire hellfire campaign run. Count the regular drops vs your few guaranteed drops. 
---
The ratio is 1000's to 1. 
---
Anni and Hats are the exception. Not the rule.
---
Why on earth would you have that stuff in your inventory?
---
Always play in a team, even if you aren't actually playing with each other. The benefits of charisma, free travel, and perk sharing are too good to pass up for almost no effort.
---
I feel like its because Im only level 50 but how do people get so many legendaries are they more frequent at higher levels
---
I wish I was.
---
Ill take that as a compliment?
---
I’m I glad I never bought an Xbox.
---
I know you'll probably never reply, but for the time being try and place your camp near a acid vent, it should give you an extractor and overtime it'll give you acid, which I guess will make your life a little bit easier than having to find it all the time.
---
Wow.   That is the saddest thing I think I've heard today.       Maybe you just need some luck lol
---
If someone is stupid enough to pay 10k for one of the sheepsquatch outfits then fuck 'em, they lose the 10k
---
Well, if possible, keep me in mind for the outfit if you do get a second one.
---
Hmm, also all true. I forgot that there are people who just have a lot of caps and feel like spending them, and I don't really blame the people who don't want to do the event. Personally, I like it, and I find it easy! But not everyone has the same experience in 76
---
I've farmed events for so long, as well, and finally had an outfit drop last night when I wasn't even trying! The VTU Jacket and Jeans... which now has a static spawn anyway... boooooo
---
Well said.
---
While I do agree that most things on the various 76 trading reddits are overpriced, there is still something to be said for purchasing items. I've purchased (with caps) the nuka cola quantum and nuka cola power armor paints, because I didn't have the time, or really, the desire to go around hunting for them.
---
For the sheepsquatch quest, I don't have the time to continuously go around server hopping, or a long enough friends list to continue cycling through each of us doing the final event. I was lucky enough to get the outfit that I wanted the first time I did the event, but not everyone else is. 
---
So if people with the time to continuously grind out the events want to make some extra caps, and those of us without the extra time (due to working full time, or managing children, or just not wanting to put in the time in game) want to pay for items we think are cool, then really, both parties benefit.
---
I mean it is trash, but we can enjoy trash.
---
Firework launchers for camps.
---
Have my Upvote because I feel the same way!
---
Stash all your junk except 1 fertilizer before joining.  You might die, but all that those leeches are getting is shit.
---
Happens all the time on PC with no mods.
---
That good idea
---
I’m on ps4 pro too. I’ve been playing since the start and so far not had any grief or anyone be an idiot. Wasn’t too keen on the multiplayer side at the beginning as like to do my own thing but I’ve completely changed my mind. Even if it’s just the odd player giving a wave and a thumbs up, really does make the game. I’ve had players drop me decent items and even fought along side other players even though we weren’t in a team. Maybe I’ve played too much cod and just expect rude players.
---
In a few
---
Not if they ninja edit.
---
sometimes, but you still have to wait for them to finish talking to actually read the next line, it's really just kinda annoying
---
I bought all mine for 1500 each except marsupial. Had to fork out the 17k for that one.
---
It is unfair. Don't engage him?
---
Did u own a workshop?
---
I meant i had already paid for the t-60 plans (and not being able to use them) now paying 6000 caps again for the other plans + having to try for weeks to get the violet flux.   I am level 79 but never been close to the fissure prime spots.
---
10000000000% yes this
---
hell yeah brother. I use my vampire auto grenade launcher when I'm the conduit.
---
that pissed me off the most, because those tapes are actually interesting.
---
Me and a friend were taking the shop in Berkeley, mid claim 2-3 others come out of fucking nowhere and kill us, respawn and killed is again. I got ptsd now whenever I come near a workshop. This happened a couple months ago. We just wanted to claim it for the daily challenge. People like that just ruin the experience. I always hit the shop and then immediately hide while I claim it, in fear of being ganked. PvP aspect should also only be active when in the area of the workshop. Another instance, my friend and I had shops, we were doing Feed the People event and some greifer was sitting just outside repeatedly killing us with a TSE because we owned workshops.
---
I certainly will! :)
---
It's definitely better. I stopped in January for a bit because I was sick of getting disconnected all the time. I'm happy to say that that rarely happens now.
---
Part of me wishes this, but I also understand that a big part of a game like this is figuring out how everything works, and works together.
---
Thanks again. This helped me knock it out!
---
Camp or workshop? If it's a workshop, he can straight kill you to claim the workshop.
---
I play with Russian localization. "Молерот" is not a molerat. Localization is good because Mothman is literally "Человек-моль" in russian. it's two words and too long to pronounce, so localization has to be slightly changed for our country. IDK if this post is bullshit/trolling, probably both
---
I think US. and Swiss are all you're going to get as far as Nations are concerned. It would be cool to have more variations of those that are available though. example those cool little Swiss parade flags should be available for US. or Factions. same with bunting.
---
Yeah but somehow he killed me in one shot before contesting it.
---
Farm mats. Mod and/or Craft weapons for customers, Help folks with quests,  Grind certain events, ferment a fresh batch of Ballistic Bock and get ready for the next business day!
---
The game itself has a lot of solid concepts and decent mechanics, and I've enjoyed the time I've spent playing it with my friends, but some of the practices executed, like literally selling quality of life in a survival game, after saying they'd only be selling cosmetics, shortly after nerfing perks that helped manage that exact quality of life? Adding brand new items to the shop, locking them exclusively to a bundle, and calling it 'discounted'? While the gameplay might be the 'co op fallout 4' it was intended to be, there's a lot of problems with the company behind it.
---
Charisma also influences your ability to share perk cards.
---
You're right! Lots of factors I forgot that come into play, thank you!
---
In addition to this. You actually get a lot more than online play a subscription to Gold. Games With Gold has some duds. However, I feel it makes the yearly cost more than worth it. Plus, with the probable combination of Game Pass &amp; Gold into a single package. The benefits are tenfold if you play a lot of different games. Just my opinion though.
---
&gt;I wanted raid/event where you have roles, or something like that.
---
There are several viable "roles" to play in this event, but since almost no one uses area chat or teams up it's fucking impossible to coordinate. 
---
* Conduit - This person should have as much enery resist gear/mutations as possible. Tag all 3 pylons and then jump on top of the shack so you don't blow up from the eyebombs or get fist bumped by the squtch..
---
* Tanks - PA melee people, bloodied builds, whatever you want that can crank out serious DPS. 
---
* Support/Technician - someone with robotics expert to pacify the gutsy bots and/or a bunch of team healing perks that they can use to keep everyone else alive.
---
Waste dump west of westech, sattilite array station next door to westech. The steak house in the mire and the robco building next to it. I also like going to the railyard in watoga east of the train station. Lots of high level animals or mirelurks there. By the time you hit the last location the mutants at westech should respawn provided someone else isnt already there. Then you just repeat the cycle.
---
So he contested your workshop and was successful, and you're mad? The only thing you can do is get the right gear to counter griefing measures. This guy stacked the cards better than you did. Accept defeat and walk away. Its a tough pill swallow, we have all done it. Sorry man
---
When being forced to eat sh*t, its best not to nibble. Bite, chew, swallow... goes alot faster.
---
Don’t people have to start claiming it from me before the PvP rules apply? He killed me before contesting it.
---
Completely irrelevant comeback
---
Wow okay awesome thanks so much dood
---
&gt;make changes to essential repair mechanics in game.
---
&gt; &gt;decide not to QA it before pushing code to production, as per bethesda/fallout team policy.
---
&gt; &gt; &gt;Tell everyone youre aware, and leave the annoying bug in game to be fix in a future update.
---
Recently got a hold of a bloodied Mr handy buzzblade. Along with my 2 pieces of unyielding armor I'm in love lol. But that's for fun. Otherwise basic rifleman and weight reduction, casual play style. Nuke zones and big stuff I have a ts .50cal. And an AA gatlin gun
---
Couldn’t they have just, you know made the already existing  UI news announcement clickable??? 
---
Instead they add a whole new pop-up that breaks with the rest of the UI and doesn’t actually add anything
---
It's not your bar, its just that your such a lousy bartender.      Not really!  I'm on XBONE or I would definitely come check it out.  Very Nice!
---
I've started keeping an Excel sheet of what items I keep on my mole. Lately I've noticed several items disappear (plans, armors, weapons). I have them listed so I know they were stored. Missing about 12 items now.
---
Yeah I’m just going to force the game to give me the same kind of gear. Good call, buddy. I’ll be sure to make my next drop a Furious Two Shot Explosive .50 cal so I can counter the next person I see.
---
Someone's salty...
---
Why shouldn't they use them?
---
It wasn't that the riddle was easy, someone datamined that information.
---
I have similar feeling around some pvp instances that make me think some people are using some kind of exploit. I've been attacked similarly, within seconds of fast traveling to my camp, not near any fast travel points. What kind of anti-cheat does fo76 have anyways?
---
This has always been a game that can hook you on the open.  Even at the shittiest of the shit phases of launch the introductory sections have been engrossing and the exploration pleasant.  The problem is that this is a games as a service model product, and that means it needs staying power.  That staying power hinges on player economy, incentives for group play, and the ability to identify and chase particular goals. 
---
 The problem with each of these is as follows; the economy for most of the opening phase was abjectly broken by two major sources - duping and infinite experience farms producing tons of junk/grenades/etc.  Duping ruined the weapon economy, wherein people who duped literally flooded the proverbial market with high powered weapons of all types spread across all playstyles.  While bethesda has managed to plug these holes, their long term attempts to reset overall player economy have largely failed and are waiting on power creep to invalidate the long term damage of these initial failures.  
---
On the incentives for group play section, and this ties into identifying and chasing goals, there are only really two things to do in the game when you get right down to it.  Farm resources and chase legendary drops.  The farming of resources has been regularly handicapped by aggressive reversions in the value of workshops in producing both ammo and fusion cores, lowering the overall value of an hour of playtime sunk into those activities.  In a similar vein the farming of legendary drops is gated by a narrow range of activities - usually just nuking whitesprings or other high yield areas, or the occasional QSB farm.  
---
Hanging as a shroud over all of this is the PVP system, with forced PVP if you attempt to hold workshops.  The PVP system is, for all intents and purposes, a complete failure.  The fallout combat system does not lend itself well to PVP, the inherently broken nature of specialized builds plus the vats autocrit system makes many encounters feel arcane and confusing with no real way to know why exactly you died to 2-3 shots from a normie rifle or tanked everything and beat someone down.  This is also where weak enforcement against exploiters handicaps things, there are a myriad set of exploits you can use to adjust client side values to influence efficacy in PVP encounters and just break the game overall.  When the game inevitably ends up with a free-to-play trial section this will become far, far worse.  
---
TLDR: you simply haven't played the game long or intensely enough to experience the true, core design failures that still permeate it.  If, when you do encounter the, you decide the journey was worth your cash expense, more power to you, but for players in the long haul on the title not only should you encourage criticism but you should keep in mind blanked support for devs is how you get things like the bioware magic debacle that has helped anthem seize worst launch title from FO76 for triple A devs.
---
They have quite a few new ones out for survival mode. Also a new one with the sheepsquatch event.
---
owning a workshop is the same thing as full consent to pvp regardless of your location on the map. It's been this way for a long time so sadly your only choice is to avoid taking workshops unless you want to PvP,   
---
that said, I find that it's rare this happens.  
---
Perhaps in some future update it will change bit for now, this is intentional.
---
Free thinker is almost always code for they're free of thinking.
---
You're a child, aren't you champ?
---
Defend the tail gate? Random wrecked trucks with kegs and a grill in back get attacked by random hordes- 
---
Make it a pop up event like defend workshops.
---
Dude! Are you on PC. I've got a  lvl 50 3\* Troubleshooter's Flamer that I'll see you cheap. 
---
Specs: +30% damage to robots, 25% faster fire rate, +1 Perception.
---
Crushing blow
---
Medical malpractice
---
Sole survivor
---
Just added you!
---
Did it!
---
I could be wrong, but my understanding is that the vicinity around a workshop, once it has been claimed, is a PVP zone.
---
"Granny's got a treeet for youu!"
---
I like it
---
I’m kinda dense is this a mod ?? am I being trolled lol , or can you buy it in the atom store ??
---
Sure thing. Goodluck with the leveling. Those mirelurk kings are a real bitch in the trainyard xD.
---
That is stupid as fuck and basically puts anyone who doesn’t have a (likely duped) two shot explosive weapon and full assassin/unyielding gear in a position where they can’t have workshop because only similar gear stands any chance of competing.
---
I wish there was a way we could put your last statement to the test. Your d/k ratio is probably much higher but kills or damage overall would go to the melee builds I’m guessing.
---
You can play a game you don't enjoy for many hours.  In fact, it happens a lot, because they're trying to find the value.  Length of time played isn't a good measure of enjoyment.
---
I put 40 hours into Anthem and 10 hours into Resident Evil 2.  I would by and large consider RE2 to be the superior game by far.
---
I see that stuff for sale on the market subreddits all day. Go get it! Literally tse and assassin sentinel is all over the markets. The whole trade aspect is a huge part of this game that alot of people dont take advantage of. I mean, unless you want to sit here and complain then by all means!
---
Now that I think about it, that's kinda what I do, seek out legendaries hoping for some drop that will make me faster, stronger, better looking (lol), etc.  It is indeed a grind and not unlike playing the lottery.  If you keep a mindset of 'Wow! What could this guy drop?' it keeps the interest up.  It's like golf, 50 bad shots are forgotten when you make that one good one.  All the Nocturnal Wooden whatever pieces are forgotten with that one explosive, faster reloading, plus some other thing pump shotgun.  If you are on PS4, look me and and we can farm.
---
Same here, got it with my new Xbox and a lot of people told me to sell for really cheap to code or leave it, I decided to play it and I've had a lot of fun, really taking my time with the game, only problem I've had was more on side with my internet, reseted the modem and was good to go again.
---
In other words, people geared/specced for PVP &gt; people not geared/specced for PVP.
---
By taking a workshop you open yourself to PVP. This person appears to have focused their gear and build for PVP, so of course they are going to mop the floor with you. Don't go engaging them AGAIN after they show you they're better.
---
That's why I never seek revenge - I'm not a pvp focused player.
---
Every single one of them carries a couple caps. If you take care of them all, you have bus money again. That’s my treat. Oh! And steel from their weapons
---
Is this an atom store product I’m kinda dense so I’m not realizing if this its a troll or not lmao!!!  I don’t  see it for sale ????
---
A pony themed PA skin would part me of my Atoms. Maybe something like the Giddy Up Buttercup PA from FO4. I picked that up in the CC when it was free.
---
I run bloodied ski sword.
---
Моль is moth in Russian so it's literally mothmouth
---
I have seen this often since the game was released.
---
Hey there, didnt track plans - sorry. Made note of just one, T51b chest plans.
---
He's not lying. If you want to initiate the event you have to spend 1750-2500 (depending on perks) on the keycard, and then use flux and some other random mats to "repair it."
---
Yes, you can wait around and hope for someone else to start the event, but eventually everyone is going to use their first free card,  people aren't going to want to spend 2k to run it if the rewards are shit, and it'll stop popping up.
---
I feel you. My success record isn't great and, when I am finally winning, have had the server disconnect or the game crash on me twice. It's been a frustrating slog.
---
Every core and turret had a slice hermetically sealed inside. Did you not open their confectionery access port?
---
I read that too. But from experience, when queen is 40% and I switch to executioner buzzblade. Whether it’s me or all of us, the queen just melts. But at 40% and I use bloodied buzzblade, I notice the health bar isn’t melting as fast compared when I switch to executioner. Using furious even at start of fight, it does more damage than bloodied for me. Maybe cause I’m not at super low hp. But whatever. Dying is no fun.
---
~~They're just aggressively re-using the Halloween decorations from FO4~~ It's just a thematic decision about the lore. When Todd said we would all be roleplaying NPCs in the world, what he really meant is we were dressing up for Halloween
---
They can, but unless you're specced for it the DoT will kill you faster than stims can heal.
---
I'm down with nation flags long as the UK one is separated. I want a Scottish flag
---
You sound like a top guy. Why aren’t you on ps4 instead.
---
Why what happened?
---
Yes, if YOU want to initiate it. I'm understanding his post as saying you cannot participate unless you pay. That is simply not true. Any way, shape or form. Less likely? Sure. Unable to? Not even close. That is false.
---
It's possible to counter most of this.  Fireproof perk + padded/dense armor mod will nulify explosive damage.  there's perks, chems, and standard armor that will reduce the shotgun base damage to something you can stim pack to at least give yourself a chance.
---
As for sentinel+assasin 2 things: crits pierce all of that completely.  So if you can get an alpha strike headshot crit in, that can 1 shot someone without a TSE depending on your build.  Something like a base "the dragon" would likely do the job.
---
Lastly, stagger is a hard counter to sentinel so pain train and various weapon perks that can stagger open up the other guy to increased damage.
---
Taken in sum, you DO need a pvp focused build to compete, but it's false you need sentinels/assassins or top end god roll weapons.
---
If you completed the quests leading up to the event you definitely did. It's in the Wolf's cache box and is called Assaultron Recall Keycard.
---
I still have to hope a weapon for my build pops up otherwise I have to completely respec just to start countering these people which means hours of grinding levels. 
---
Trading *can* be a reasonable solution but it’s entirely based on chance. Even if something I can benefit from immediately pops up I have to hope I can currently log on and trade for it before someone else does or that the seller is nice enough to hold it or even wants caps for it.
---
Stop it already with the speculating that people are speculating. /s :p
---
This is the beginning of my build, and has to expand. I use bloody mess, demo expert, and skeet shooter primarily.. if I can get my weight under control, I'll switch weight reduction ones in strength to shotgun damage perks. With a long barrel on my Quad double barrel explosive shotgun, just these basic perks make the gun tear through stuff.
---
You feel is as so
---
We can day the event is dropping mainly fedoras and the two outfits with heads are rare drops. Keeping that in mind people will ask a lot for it because the event is expensive to restart it. I will agree 10k is over priced but it is a free economy, welcome to the Wasteland Baby!
---
This happens to me as well.
---
Congrats, I guess.  Life is all about finding happiness.
---
Since the B.E.T.A.

Well-known and reported a million times.
---
I can't comprehend not fixing bugs like this.
---
You leave bugs in, they just become compounded as you keep adding more new things into the game.
---
Op doesn’t want is to
---
Thank god I caught that /s before I finished my original reply. haha
---
I'm crashing more than ever too. Just fast travelled to join in fighting SBQ. Went into stash to swap PA. Bam crash. Happening heaps since their hotfix 😭
---
Hello, the "/s" in your comment really took away the effect of the joke, and is not needed.  
---
This is a bot
---
Mothman would be cool, but what I've always wanted was a game accurate Jangles the Moon Monkey. I also really want a Mega Sloth.  Gaming Heads just announced a Mr. Fuzzy plushie, he's ok but I don't really associate him with Fallout so I wasn't too excited.
---
It seems that if you move you’re camp more than once in the game day they don’t charge the normal amount. Each time you move it that day in the game it charges you 160 caps instead of the regular amount. Found this out unfortunately.
---
Bad Bot
---
That Sounds plausible. Or it's a reward for the burrows as the item has no atom shop Symbol
---
It is worth noting, jail time and being poked with needles are both 'more fun with friends' but that doesn't mean either of those two things are recommendable experiences
---
We need Unique weapons, not carbon copies with a legendary effect and a none-default modification
---
I got my sons copy for $30.  Timed it at the height of the hate hype train.  Not sure you could get it for that now.
---
Only time sneaky drains ap is when your in PA and have a stealthmod. He seems confused all the same
---
Yes. Mothmouth, because Mothman is literally "Человек-моль" in russian, two words, and not comfortable to pronounce
---
You know a game has issues when bait posts are celebrated. "You thought I was just another person complaining, but actually I'm not!"
---
That's my point. They are probably hiding stuff better.
---
I completely agree. So much better now!
---
Yeah and fk those event challenges too if I cant get the even after 7hrs straight. Wtf is up with that. Make the event more frequent or get rid of that nonsense.
---
Get berry mentats, those invisibois won'r be a problem then.
---
I learned never to play new content blind - so I thank you for learning both yours and my lesson...  the first time I showed up I had stashed away some more valuable junk (unfortunately we don't have limitless stashes in this game) and had friends at the event.
---
Every time I do this event, I'll wait for enough people to show up first if its all randoms.  Haven't failed or gone down once, but I've aggroed the sheepy and had it chase me around once!  Its the same deal for Scorched Earth these days, get bads and you'll fail so I check the map first before joining.
---
Testify! I've had similar experiences and then one day I was blessed by RNGesus. I ended one nuke zone run with 3 TS and an explosive.
---
Has anyone noticed the songs on Appalachian Radio will abruptly end go to the next song?
---
Well, I'm your typical bloodied-melee build. If you have a bloodied deathclaw gauntlet, even just a one star, I'd happily trade it for that. If you have junk, I, haha, like many, am always looking for screws, if you have a few bulked piles of those laying around.
---
Nah man, happens a lot on PS4 too
---
770 hours
---
Cant say anything that bethesda is patethic
---
I must be lucky then, I've got the BoS jumpsuit, Whitespring Caddy and the  White Powder jumpsuit...I got all of them at once from I believe  Uranium Fever. I've not gotten any other unique Event outfits though, that I recall..
---
Is this ingame price amounts (the value displayed in the item info) or the value you have set? Im only interested in the plans
---
youtubers got paid be X to say trash about Fallout 76  anyone that follows what they say need to get their heads out of their asses.  
---
just my 2 bottle caps.
---
What bug do you mean?
---
Connections have been bad since the patch, the hotfix seems to have removed a bit of lag and added a bit of stability for me, but yeah, the servers overall feel like jello!
---
check out nukes dragons, it has a build planner that should give you a good idea of what you want.
---
You sound sweeter than sugar bombs! And I love sugar bombs!
---
"You don't have to buy them" is the most ignorant, lame-ass statement in support of microtransactions i have ever heard, and it's been around forever. It alters the game for EVERYONE, buying them or not. We all have a voice in it.
---
Apologies, I didn't track plans. Only one that stood out to me was T51b chest plans but I don't recall which event dropped them. I'll add this as a category for the next run.
---
They also meant the other kind of baked, FYI.
---
r/inclusiveor
---
Yeah I never had any lag issues. Was crashing more since a few patches back but that hotfix. Yesterday i crashed 5 times. 3 in an hour. I love the game, but when you crash a crucial moments it is beyond frustrating.
---
Thank you /u/Valseek, very cool.
---
Nice write up Op, thanks. So none are considered rare ?
---
Try the fallout discord network. I found a good group of guys I play with via that.
---
I do gotta say though, I have 10 white fadoras, so best believe I'm buying outfits. Better than paying 2k caps for an event with no luck.
---
Those are different from the rare clothing drops. Also you can buy the full set for cheap in the Enclave bunker.
---
Chefs, bobbleheads, mags?
---
There are mods for 76 and I honestly do know there are sound replacers. Not sure if you could do it specifically for rad death though.
---
chems*
---
No, they're not. Most common is the fedora
---
I’m a heavy weapons PA build so going for headshot criticals isn’t really an option. I’ve tried perks like four leaf clover and better criticals but it just doesn’t reliably activate enough with the heavy AP cost to be reliable. Plus it drains cores like crazy.
---
If I’m overlooking something then I am open to suggestions but HWPA builds just seem to be entirely useless in PvP.
---
YOU WILL PAY FOR YOUR AROGENCE
---
What chems would raise gun and duh bobbleheads and mags just went over my head lol
---
If you're on PC I'll do the mascot for 500. I don't think I have duplicates of both pieces of the imposter set (yet).
---
Keep going north, they get pretty common in the pools in the northern mire, but they also get strong.
---
Defiantly yes
---
Only on xbox sadly :(
---
Yeh it's where I was but couldn't find any. Mire is the least place I've explored though so was probably just missing em. I did get this solved thanks to another user tho.
---
Thanks for answering. Appreciated :)
---
thx
---
Damn, a week ago I found a 1 star bloodied dcg, figured I wouldn't get much for a 1 star I tossed it... but I do have some screws I could trade
---
It's a common bug that was first reported at launch.
---
Still not fixed.
---
Me and my boyfriend love it! We just go around at our own pace exploring, do quests that pop up that sound interesting to us. We often go out on junk hunts but always find somewhere new to explore and get completely sidetracked. 
---
We both think it's a great game! There's a few little things that we don't like about it but then again every game has bits like that. :)
---
Also good luck using regular armor in nuke zones. If there was legendary power armor normal armor would never be used, there would be no reason for it.
---
I hate to say it but that can't be right. I have a fairly high endurance on a few characters and every one of them will catch a disease without even taking a hit from a creature. It's much more akin to an aura that diseased creatures have rather than an infection by hit. I've shot diseased mole rats just as they pop up before they even attack and still picked up a disease from them and the same for charging ghouls...if they even get close they'll pass on a disease.
---
It's a known issue and apparently Bethesda is aware of the problem. Not sure when they are going to fix it but it's affecting us all.
---
Uh, not for my build it isn’t
---
Sounds like your number is quite reasonable—especially if you are using an automatic receiver.
---
Rumors state we might be getting some but once legendary vendor comes out and its going to not intill another week but yea currently power armor no where as good as regular armor when you take into account legendary prefixes that make you into an unkillable melee god.
---
Thank you + krama
---
False on both claims. 1: I'm not "in support of microtransactions." I just don't care about the argument anymore. It's a legitimate way for a business to make money. 2: My game will not be impacted by anyones ability to fix a weapon with a repair kit. PERIOD.
---
You seem like a "Repair Kits are Pay to Win" comment maker so let me ask... What are you "winning" with these repair kits, assuming they are as game breaking as people are making them out to be?
---
After a few months of playing this is the first I've had it. I thought liberators and mole rats annoyed the shit out of me but this bug is next level.
---
Damn. Well, keep server hopping for that event then man. Thoughts and prayers.
---
As a counter anecdote, I played on xbox for 3+ hours last night, and other than some frame drops during an SBQ fight I didn't experience any issues.
---
Just keep server hopping. I was in three yesterday
---
Gary!
---
Oki, thank you for your time
---
 *P.S also for the people thinking this is a stupid suggestion and whatnot  (cause that usually what happens when people suggest something)  remember, I don't care, I will NEVER care, and I won't respond to this  thread since this is for bethesda's eyes only, xo.* 
---
Uh... why? Most people actually agree that the Flamer needs some buffs and cheaper/higher quantity fuel crafting is one of the most suggested ones. 
---
But you're never going to reply so it's pointless to ask anyway.
---
Never heard of that place before. Where exactly is it located?
---
You are lucky, and the word is all 3 always drop at once. I'm a wee bit envious and congrats!
---
It was awful the way it was before losing twice your caps. However, only losing 1/4 of your caps now seems like a major nerf in reverse.  
---
Heck, I would be fine with losing 100% of your caps or working in some step % based on number of kills.  
---
What bothers me are the new or alt low level characters.  I ran into a lvl 4 that was loaded to the gills with great weapons and armor and if I kill him my reward is less than 5 caps?
---
Hello there.
---
I think this kind of faction Wars would be a lot more suitable/fun than the survival mode.
---
Actually i've been posting this idea in the oficial foruns about a unique mode(like survival).
---
Cause IMO the survival thing is ok, but sure is pointless.
---
Why not implementing something consistent with actual fun/rewards.
---
In my idea it would work like that:
---
* Join a faction (Responders, Raiders, BoS, Enclave, Orders of Mysteries)
---
* Same map, but every faction would have their own base and spawn point
---
* Fulfilling objectives give you faction points
---
* With faction points you could buy unique rewards of every faction(i.e: Raider PA skin,skin for your CAMP vendor BOT, etc)
---
Obectives:
---
1. Kill  a player of a different faction (+10pts)
---
2. Claim a workshop (+30pts)
---
3. Recruit allies (like in mayhem Main story where you have to "be friend" with a deathclaw) you could try and recruit some enemies like a super mutant and give orders(with emotes) like ATK / STAY / FOLLOW
---
4. Nuke an Enemy base (why not?) (+250pts) Where you could gather a lot of materials for a nuke craft (Wood/acid/etc.etc.)
---
5. Build fortifications for your base.
---
I think this would be a lot more interesting than mindless killing/being killed with no reason and no point at all like it happens in survival mode.
---
Lets keep posting our ideas of these Faction Wars, Bethesda are a great company and they really listen the comunity, so maybe if ppl enjoy this idea we could get something like that. It would be a great add for this amazing game.
---
Cheers
---
Oh no. Not this bug again.
---
Agreed. I have some mods in storage waiting for this fix.
---
Yes, handmade is new to me and yet to get enough to break down for a hardened receiver
---
No, but there was cake.  In a secret side panel
---
The light and HUD colour should totally be changeable like in 4. I get bored of the standard green, but usually go back to it for that classic FO3 feel.
---
Unless you're talking about the colour of the actual pip-boy machine itself. Never. They charge atoms for pip-boy skins. It'll never happen without PC mods
---
I spend way too much time just hanging around my CAMP, making little changes here and there. Collecting my purified water and vegetables and junk from the extractor. Smoke a bowl, repeat. Make some beer and adhesive...
---
&gt;The reason higher level players have better camps is that we have found more plans for stuff that takes up less budget
---
That, and we've realized that turrets are pretty fucking worthless and aren't a good use of the limited build budget.
---
Good point!
---
Wouldn't a powerful automatic receiver do more damage than a tweaked?
---
My build is Blocker rank 1, 
---
Rifleman rank 3, expert rifleman rank 3, master rifleman rank 3, concentrated fire rank 3, tank killer rank 3, 
---
fireproof rank 2, 
---
lone wanderer rank 1, 
---
demo. expert rank 5, nerd rage rank 3, 
---
covert operative rank 3, adrenaline rank 5, dodgy rank 3, gun fu rank 3, 
---
serendipity rank 3, starched genes rank 2, bloody mess rank 3, grim reaper sprint rank 3, and better criticals rank 3.
---
The mutations I run are adrenal reaction (staple), marsupial, eagle eyes, and speed demon.
---
My armor is 5x Assassin/Sentinel with an assault gas mask and traveling leather coat.
---
Weapon is lv45 bloodied, explosive, vats cost reduction Gauss rifle. Only weapon I carry.
---
Pre buffs and below 20% hp I do just over 1100 damage on paper.
---
The armor is the hardest part to attain, if you cannot afford, or are unlucky with farming, then I suggest Sentinel by itself, or unyielding to buff perception and agility coupled with the low hp.
---
I never have problems with dying, even in pvp, unless I am not paying attention to my AP, or I get 3v1 and they stagger me with rapid fire.
---
Corporations always under appreciate software testing until the customer uses the bug filled software. 
---
-Software Tester.
---
It's very possibly an aura. I will double check that. It would make a lot more sense as 10-30 % per server tick is very easily almost guaranteed unless lucky
---
Not pay to win, pay for convenience. Pay for better quality of life. Things that should be available to EVERYONE. Also, and this is my biggest thing, Bethesda breaking a promise made over a year ago.
---
I had forgotten about that!
---
I just posted build, sorry im stuck at work right now.
---
One gun army with a high ROF gun might stagger enough to counter sentinels, I've never tried that build but maybe someone else can comment.
---
If you are in PA, pain train is a guaranteed stagger.
---
As for crits you need an "alpha strike" weapon to really make that work.  So maybe a broadsider or harpoon gun with all 9 ranks of heavy weapons damage perks + pain train + concentrated fire + better criticals would do the trick.
---
So basically bank a crit, pain train to stagger then vats crit headshot.
---
That or high ROF + one gun army and with all the defense I mentioned in my 1st post it might just be a coin flip kinda deal.
---
That would work pretty well with a basic "the dragon" for example, but I don't use heavy weapons in 76 so not sure if you'd need a specific gun to pull that all off.
---
HAving said all this I play stealth rifle build so not exactly an expert on PA + heavy weapons.
---
If you're asking if ultracite PA has calibrated shocks, yes. I looted a plan off SBQ last week and was pretty happy.
---
I did, they aren't at all representative of the scale
---
Dad?
---
Lol i dont know the receivers. I have them all for my lever action.
---
It's random. 7 wolf hats though? Terrible luck
---
owning a workshop is the same as being wanted
---
1000 events? You deserve a rewards apart from the loot. That’s insane!
---
Repair kits are a gateway drug. Once they hit the streets our children will be huffing atoms at an alarming rate. Eventually repair kits wont be enough and theyll need 5 star gear just to feel something and at that point theyll be injecting those atoms into their veins and selling themselves for more atoms all to win. Theyll be so whacked out of their minds on atoms that theyll just ruin nukezones foreveryone, no shared xp for anyone. This isnt speculation its real life. Welcome to the winners circle, the price: Your Life!
---
I had this happen to me the other day. Apparently it's a bug that's been around forever, and may be linked with using a legendary weapon with the explosive prefix, although it's not clear. Melee still worked fine for some reason. I ended up logging out and logging back in, which cleared it up. Which is not at all convenient if you have workshops or are in the middle of an event chain, of course.
---
I'm on pc I will pm you my playername
---
Frankly the majority of the negativity this game received was deserved. I don't mean that it wasn't overblown, because it was, I just mean that the vast majority of the people who were being objective and came to negative conclusions about the game were just being honest. If you had played since launch you'd either agree with or understand all the negative viewpoints of the game. There are lots of us who're still here despite the negativity simply because the issues aren't that big of a deal compared to the fun we have whilst playing. 
---
Now our biggest issues are long standing bugs and occasionally Bethesda will do some silly shit in a patch(like reintroducing major bugs that had been fixed) that we have to deal with for a few weeks. I'd give the game a 6.5 or 7/10, certainly fun to play and enough content to be worth the cost, but no where near perfect. The best part is, while bethesda often makes mistakes or missteps during patches, they're generally heading in a good direction. In a few years this game will hopefully be amazing and have mod support on private servers. That's what I'm really waiting for.
---
Dood. You have no idea what they will cost.
---
Your the daft one.
---
Any scorchbeasts can drop prime plans.
---
I get it Op... The people doing that also tend to spawn camp or hang out right outside of events. They are usually out to ruin someone else's fun.
---
So block them and go to a new server.  That is all you can do.  Beth won't nerf a legitimate combo, and griefers love it when you get mad.  Don't get into respawn cycles and lose your cool. Don't let them keep slaughtering you at events.  It's not worth even trying to finish the event when they get going.
---
Just ignore and move.
---
Your perceptions are incorrect. A good build is more important than the legendaries you use. 
---
Did you know you can increase your damage by 5 times with only two perks? Covert operative increases sneak attack damage by 2.5x. concentrated fire allows you to only land head shots in vats. Head shots are likely 2x more damage. Together that is 5x. TSE is only a 1.5 times increase in damage. And the explosive bit can be negated with perks and armor mods.
---
I use a 53 damage anti armor pistol with a sneak attack, head shot, critical hit build. I am actually dealing 250+ damage per bullet at 7 bullets per second under ideal circumstances. I have a favorable record against the TSE sentinel/assassin meta. The only times I lose are when damage bugs out and does not register my critical hit damage.
---
You do not need a TSE of sentinel set to do well in PVP. Those items are essentially easy mode for anyone not wanting to learn game mechanics or strategy.
---
Maybe Wesley is a nickname or title or prominent figure. As in he's "the Wesley". So his house would be "the Wesley's house".
---
List:
---
-White wolf fedora
---
-Sheep mascot outfit
---
-Sheep mascot head
---
-Sheep imposter head 
---
-Sheep imposter outfit
---
P.S(I might have forgotten a couple of items)
---
Either you get a key card from the quest or you buy a circuit board from a vendor for 2000 caps to make it. That's why it's scarce
---
Only done one run so far, I got the sasquatch costume head. It's just RNG
---
Psychotats would
---
Guess I'll have to try the SBQ fight again. Has so been not worth it cause I kinda suck at it. Lol
---
*has flashbacks to death claw healing itself*
---
Psycho and its variants.  Also the ballistic bock beer gives +15%.
---
Funny enough, all I get is the mascot outfit.
---
50% limb damage 3 star.
---
Event rewards are- Fedora, Mascot Head, Mascot outfit, Impostor Head, Impostor Outfit, Assaultron Head plan. The fixer plan. Don't know if there are others, that's all I was hunting for. Took around 20 successful completions for me to get (the fixer plan took longest for me.)
---
3x sounds about right and, yeah, I wish there were degrees of jumping based on how long/hard you hold the button.
---
I must have been logged off
---
Unbearable? I think you mean "unmolerateable," kind sir.
---
If you do pick it up, will another not be there when you server hop? Is that not like a world object that is first come first served? Becauseeee I might have to adjust my whole strategy
---
I'm trying to compare the two and see what you're missing.
---
I've had this happen when there was no clear place for the Bravo to land.  I ran my ass to a slightly flatter area, killed the scorch, it landed almost immediately.
---
1: They are available to everyone, you can earn them in game. 2:Companies change their policies all the time. ALL. THE. TIME.
---
Damn it! I never knew! Lol
---
yeah iv'e said that before the in game community is great its outside that more toxic then the water in Grafton
---
I smack the windows key on my keyboard when that happens and it starts working again.
---
What's the other perks on it :) ?
---
I'm on PS4. The big thanks goes to the person that made that map. It's invaluable when trying to decide where to place a camp if you're looking for easy mats.
---
I really suggest a junk pile. It provides a little of almost everything. You would be surprised how often you run out of something, need just 1 or 2, and it's right there in your basement already.
---
PS4 probably has the highest pop
---
Annoying having to try to hit the gutters at train stations so you can go inside, but less annoying than when I play my lowbie who isn't marsupial yet.
---
Played from Beta on and off between other games but started trying to be more in to it since the last event. Main character is only 21 though! Sadly none of friends have had an interest in FO76 so Spend more time running for my life from Super mutants because I'm always alone and running out/breaking weapons.
---
I've had great experince in random teams with higher levels ( &amp; sadly the odd douch bag here and there attacking ) 
---
But good out ways the bad and how generous and helpful other players are in this community is what has me coming back that I've started trying to help new vault dwellers with making  chained all-star bats and some plans I have spare!
---
Hey op if you play on pc I can craft them on your armor for free if you have the mats
---
I’ll try your suggestions but frankly I’m starting to reconsider heavy weapons PA overall. I mean there’s a reason that basically everyone geared for PvP doesn’t use this crap.
---
But if you can manage to stay alive and tag a few you get the exp too no?
---
Mine didn't show until I looted the fake Sheepsqautch.
---
This should be sorted out by Tuesday at the latest. However,  I'm sure it will introduce a new or recurring bug upon it's repair.
---
Dog-kissing?  I feel attacked.
---
Its a solid game that no one wanted so a majority of people don't even give it a chance. I'd argue its better than FO4 since there is an actual chance of dying and you dont need a handful of mods to have survival aspects. 
---
That and I personally like the no NPCs thing since I have felt more for a handful of tapes than I have for any NPC. Fallout's appeal to me has always been exploring the wastes and basically seeing the ghosts of the past which is all 76 is. Combine that with 76 easily having the best looking map Bethesda has put out and you have a good mixture going. I hope it continues to go up!
---
No, I mean the actual screen color and hud color
---
that 9.99 gives you 4 statues the combined 3 as one and each of the 3 heroes individually so its more like 2.50 each
---
The survivalist, He showed that a great Story can be told through holotapes in honest hearts. Sadly bethesda didnt adapt
---
"C32 repeat, calling C32"
---
Eh paid DLC doesn't work well in games like these as it'll end up splitting the playerbase
---
What if we could get mirelurk queen glands, and craft acid for this gun. It would be like 400 rounds per gland.
---
I have hoarded a lot of ammo while playing melee, waiting To find the ranged weapon i needed, now that i have my lever action rifle, i sit on 14k .45ammo.
---
Yeah, and it can happen with other players too.
---
Incomplete paperwork. Please consult the terminal for instructions.
---
As soon as you learn to use the search function, because like every other "suggestion" everyone ever posts in this God forsaken sub you're not the first person to whine that 1/5 of the daily challenges is an actual challenge.
---
I'm soooooo looking forward to the other dozen threads that should pop up before the day is over crying about how losing out on 10 atoms today is all part of Bethesda's master scheme to take all of our money.
---
I think Atomic Shop repair kits are their answer unfortunately. You'll probably be able to use those while in PA... Which frankly makes even less sense. Can't use a table but can rep something on the fly while in a metal suit? Yeah, sure.
---
It has been like that for 2 fallout games that I know of. Maybe they will change it, but it is unlikely. I am also annoyed by this as an all time power armour user.
---
Bloody Jack of all trades. Melee, shotguns, rifles, heavy weapons. Whatever. As long as it's bloody.
---
I wasn’t able to loot the sheepsquatch I kept dying from conduit damage even after The event ended
---
You are using the same old tired arguments. Under your thought, they could sell two shot explosive everything and it would be OK since you can earn it. It's more than just policy. This is ruining the goodwill of the players. And one more thing, you clearly support microtransactions, you aren't just passive about them.
---
OK I run borderless too, I'll give that a try next time I run into it.
---
well there are 4 varients you could take the all in one on on one side and the 3 individuals on the other side
---
If you handcraft a core with high intelligence the bar can go over 100% durability and when you put it in your weapon as ammo it'll have over the 250 shots. Normally for me its an extra 60-80 shots.
---
With the class freak perk there is no reason not to be mutated
---
I'm still hoping that the Purveyor will exchange 3\* tokens for every Drill and Rolling Pin you turn in to him....
---
If they shot from outside the circle they would not be in pvp mode so they wouldn’t do any damage. I imagine the “circle” would be larger then the workshop, more like the distance where when you leave it pops up the “you are leaving the event”.  That gives a lot of room to move around and fight it out if that’s what you want.  
---
Now I can see a situation where someone just takes a workshop and someone immediately contests it and kills the person before they can react, but that’s not to big a downside to have a peaceful non-server-hopping way out of a workshop
---
Man, I really need to get around to reading some of the side content.
---
Damn, we doing hits now?
---
If you need a mining helmet so you can see in the dark (the PA disables your pipboy light) just let me know.
---
Right on, I got it!
---
Wow that is so much more value and so worth it 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
---
I rationalize it as you have significantly less finger dexterity for the fine motor movements that would be needed for crafting when wearing PA.
---
Terminals? Just smash keyboard. Scraping? Just smash stuff into itty bitty pieces.
---
also explosions....
---
For cosmetics packs?
---
Also what good is a databased pa helmet? +2 intelligence is pointless if you can't craft
---

The Wesley's House.
---
I'm sorry for the noob questions, but junk piles give random junk? I mean that makes sense, but I figured it would be better to prioritize a specific material than junk itself? But I guess when you need a bit of everything at the same time(like me leveling) junk piles are better?(sorry I think outloud/type my thought)
---
Thanks for commenting! Thats exactly why I made this post, I personally just throw on a stealth boy myself when I run into these type and murder them. But im speaking on behalf of the people who who dont use every single resource they can in game to make the fight as unfair as possible for players who arent as well versed in pvp. Then sit there like "yes i am le epic fallout god" its corny, just like most of the people commenting on this post
---
400 hours, i got 1 outfit...yikes
---
I have not seen discussion of the introduction of higher tier armor or weapons, but yes it seems like perhaps something to be added in later.
---
How about fixing the game first

Probably this last one wrecked the game bad. At least for me on Xbox. They made some cool changes but f.ed alot of it up. The renaming should have been left soley through the pipboy instead they give you three ways to do it. The change to access you stash is annoying but liveable. But the repair extra step is too much of a pain to forgive. Not to mention player vending was pushed back too. Was really looking forward to this update. I just hope that the burrows is better than sheepquatch.
---
The max is 4 stars but for that you need a 3* weapon and a weapon mod that adds another star
---
Somebody contested my workshop and I put a mag of bloodied light machine gun into him and nothing. Luckily my turrets killed him, this is ridiculous lmao
---
I’ve been doing leader of the pack and buried with honor in hopes of getting the cowboy outfits to no avail. Now it looks as I thought a useless endeavor. The drop rate makes it meaningless to keep trying.
---
What are the rare clothes in game?
---
I have what I'd like to call the "Eeeehhhh??????" build.
---
Didn't really care what cards I got, just got the ones that looked cool. I sincerely regret that now. Although, I'm trying to shift to a melee rifle build, slowly but surely.
---
Yeah it just a case of I don't want to spend my time playing server hopping, I'd rather just play the game.
---
Over-compensate much?
---
Homemade lvl. 50 multi-purpose axe. Never let me down before.
---
Yup. I have one just to warn me when enemies have spawned in my basement, never seen it kill anything.
---
"same old tired arguments" Same could be said about you using that statement over and over. You're saying nothing new. I'm not supporting the microtransactions, what I am is actively against seeing nearly every freaking post here on reddit getting turned into a repair kits bad thread. It's been DAYS... We've made our collective voice heard, Bethesda clearly hasn't issued a single comment about all feedback, and we know very little about how it'll work. Just relax.
---
At least that would make the pvp somewhat interesting
---
If you could do everything in power armor people wouldn't ever get out of it. I find it annoying too but I feel like it's necessary. Imagine how bad it must smell in there.
---
Why would there be an apostrophe in *Wesleys*?  You don't use an apostrophe to make a name plural.
---
That's what I've heard as well, all 3. And Thanks, I'm sure you'll get them eventually.
---
Then why can you lock pick?
---
🇫🇮
---
Wow thats so big
---
You know people have issues when people complain that the complaint wasn't an actual issue.
---
Smash lock.  (Okay, this one is a little flaky)
---
What needs fixing exactly?
---
I don’t think that would fit in with the lore.
---
the Wesleys' House then would be appropriate :-)
---
I made the same mistake too, for this and the ammo perk...lol
---
The game is improved a lot and we're happy to have you welcome to the club
---
Is then molerat not then mothman?
---
Most of this debate isn't about Repair kits. Its about the opening of the doors for more non-cosmetics which could lead to p2w.
---
In case your reply is going to be "Its not pay to win if its available in game." That is semantics. If a credit card can save you 10 hours of grind, then you are paying to win at Fallout.
---
Let me guess, someone stole your sweet roll?
---
I appreciate the input, but considering the first sentence already makes it clear you haven't read a word of my post, I don't think there's any constructive reply I could give you
---
Upvote. That's a fun read.
---
Enemies to respawn every so often if you sit at the red rocket. A legendary isnt always among the group though. Testing it rn.
---
Dang. You used your cleverness to turn it around on me. You should write for Colbert or Conan or some shit
---
I didn't put too much thought into my character to begin with; wanted a sleazy looking guy who was good at lockpicking and possibly a chem dealer... ended up calling him Fat Tony (even though he's pretty skinny.) 
---
I began formulating his backstory as I played - he was in his early teens when he fell in with a mob family (Eddie Winter's crew perhaps?) and was a jack of all trades type guy; schmoozing, stealing etc. As he gained experience he rose through the ranks to become a capo in his late teens/early twenties, by this time he was a proficient hitman, chem runner you name it. He then went into the valut somehow and left 25 years later to continue his life of crime. I imagined eventually he'd transition into a raider guy as its very similar to the dog eat dog life he left pre-war.
---
However, this is where it being a multiplayer game makes this whole scenario troublesome, how do I transition him into being an arsehole, kill and take from anyone type of guy when I don't want to be a griefer myself and destroy other people's settlements? This is why I think the multiplayer aspect is stifling my character. As a player I often wave at others, but Fat Tony wouldn't do that.
---
Xbox will temp ban for use of the f word... petty revenge possible.
---
You have to go to the terminal again.
---
I ran into a couple of people at work that were put off by the reviews and such. I told them to give it a shot and rent it, now they've both bought the game this week. I've even recruited my lovely wife to roam the wastelands with me. Really enjoying everything so far!   
---
    Xbox: Bonkazuka
---
Bug got worse since patch 8.
---
You can get more mounted wasteland creature plans
---
Just block them.
---
Yeah, I remember someone saying that didn't work for the first day we got it, but last 2 days I was able to get 2/3 for 1 level.
---
I'm not sure all of them, but off the top of my head the Responder Firefighter Uniform (not to be confused with the Firebreather), Witch Costume (not the hat), and assorted clean versions of the jumpsuits like the Whitespring one. At least those are what I've been after, only found the Witch costume by trading and I've been playing since the beta.
---
Youre kidding. Fuck well this sucks
---
Shake it off. Dude probably mixed up your username with another player. 
---
and some players are just angry, unwashed little bridge dwellers. Gaming allows them a modicum of power, that they sorely lack in their own lives. 
---
Assume their lives suck, have some empathy for the sadsacks… block 'em, and move on.
---
 "Человек-мотылек" would be eternally better than "Молерот", but there are  other options if you think about it, like "челомоль", "молемэн". Gosh, even "радмотылек" would be better than "молерот" in a game where molerats are a thing. Well, in any game, tbh.
---
I am guessing star 4 will come with legendary players.
---
You almost mirrored my thoughts exactly reading through this. I have a bachelors in statistical sciences and operations research, and I was intrigued by the data. Notably, this is a single sample and it doesn't appear any statistical analysis was used to determine if there was a significant difference between the outcomes of the drops. However, like you stated it looks as if there isn't enough of a difference, by eyeballing it, to consider it not uniform. This would ideally require a lot more data to generate a sound conclusion, by exactly what you stated about variables with many different possibilities. I say most because there are a few possible exceptions that would require further investigation. For example, I did notice that the nocturnal modifier showed up back-to-back (close together) in the data on several occasions and I would imagine this is consistent with the player collecting legendary items at night. Anyway, great job collecting all the data OP.
---
I'm okay with the drops...just be nice if I could get fewer assassins robot legs and trouble shooters rolling pins...or perhaps fewer pieces that are always 10-20 levels lower than my level regardless of the legendary I'm fighting....that would be great.
---
I heard it on archer, although I can assure you it doesn’t exist but if it did it’s probably a Fun land and aquarium where dissidents are certainly not sent to to be tortured and forced to do hard labor until they die
---
That would unnerve me too. Luckily, you've blocked them, and they can't really do anything to you irl.
---
Go out into the wastes and do something wholesome!
---
Mine never fails to finish me off when I am downed.
---
Use an in game container instead of paper bag.
---
Is English your second language?
---
I've had issues with being blown up after death (usually from a car in whitesprings) and having my bag not be there when I re-spawn.  That's the only thing holding me back from getting this perk.
---
Just find a quiet place with a container instead. Never paper bag it
---
Excited 😃
---
But you CAN access terminals while in Power Armor.  Keyboard smashing and hacking skills apparently.  Just seems inconsistent and inconvenient.
---
I post my shots on IG actually. Not a dedicated page for screens but I post a lot
---
Cool beans!
---
Interesting, never even knew about this 🤔
---
Somebody last night held agro on her for almost the entire event, I thought on the roof of the shack, and I was able to just beat on her from close by with my melee and it all went very quick and easy.  I don’t know what the guy was doing, maybe it was someone doing this?(you!)
---
Can I drop by and take a look? 
---
(Which console?)
---
Highest number of stars weapons can currently go up to is 3. A few weapons can also be modded with mods that the game for some reason counts as a legendary effect so it will make them appear 4 star if applied to a 3 star version. I'd consider that a "fake" star, in my opinion. 
---
I'm guessing that true 4-5 star legendary gear will given as rewards for completing Vault raids or drop from the boss at the end of one.
---
Legendary players?
---
I suppose you'll have to log into adventure to see. Why does it matter in survival when you can't fast travel there anyways?
---
sounds more like Lubyanka or something like that. But Lavianka is not a word, sorry about that :)
---
I've yet to get the hat in 3 runs. I'm hoping to get one soon.
---
I want a slightly curved concrete foundation for a "Driveway" in front of my garage to go with the concrete foundation already in game.....like the pieces they had in FO4 in Sanctuary for driveways...
---
Need more stair case options, one that takes up full width of a tile, one that takes up half that mounts to the left or right  and one that can be built into a single square space and not take up 2 tiles worth of build space.
---
I made it to the pylons area but it terminal says aborted everytime.   Tried three days in a row, with teammates.   Nothing.
---
Or perhaps the legendary vendor soon to appear?
---
Post some pictures, my friend
---
Amen friend! I'm level 215 and can't hack a robot, how it that possible.
---
I feel your pain. The safest way to transfer is to find someone else to take the stuff in a trade menu, switch characters and trade again. Totally sucks and takes so much longer.
---
Whoever is the equivalent of Saint-14 from Destiny 2 is my favorite.
---
&gt; Item repairs requiring backing out of the workbench each time you repair an item.
---
I think devs cut repair kits from the patch and this additional tab is what left. There probably should be choose between repair kit and workbench repair
---
Democracy Day.
---
This is brilliant thanks, notice you only have 1 in lone wanderer,  Im guessing you run in a team? Wondering if this is why i cant get the bloody damage up perhaps?
---
Started a new character for survival and trying to get explore as much as I can
---
Which console
---
Noted, well now that I lost a ton of shit I am freed up of a ton of weight so I guess back to farming lol
---
Pretty sure the "rare" cosmetics in the game are supposed to be ultra-rare.
---
Like, Runescape 2007 Party Hat rare.
---
The game may have bugs but it not game breaking
---
I would love to see a comment from a community manager at the very least here.
---
What platform?
---
How about no pvp period in adventure mode? You need the workshop someone took? Hop to another server. If it’s a daily challenge, hop on the mic and ask the owner to hop server. 
---
Only time pvp is allowed is when both players decide to take pacifist off and go at each other.
---

Hogwash. I'm fine with pay to QoL.  The rest is just your perception of convenience. If someone doesn't have time for the "10 hours of grind" just to repair their weapon, and they want to pay to repair it. Meh. Not something I'd do.
---
that is very kind of you! unfortunately im on ps4, but seriously thank you for the offer
---
And screws, I always seem to be short on those.
---
That's the chase variant.
---
You should stop wasting your time and mine with dumb responses to legitimate concerns.
---
It does say life size in the description. They didnt mention the best feature though, it has pyrotechnics built in.
---
Already swapped in dodgy and serendipity and seeing a big difference..need to move a few points for the rest
---
I have and reported them. It’s the first time I had a negative experience.
---
I never should’ve come here
---
That wouldn't hurt PvPers and would benefit the CoOpers so I'm not against
---
Yeah they do carry a seemingly disproportionate amount of gold forks.  I guess they have some etiquette while they're eating your brain.
---
Shut up and take my money
---
They moved to the Golf Club after being evicted.  Those ghouls people farm? Yeah that's your old residents. You can see all their stuff like beds etc lying around.
---
If you run bloodied then do 1 Chameleon piece and the rest Unyielding. If you don't do bloodied use all Chameleon.
---
I can’t even get back in the basement to get on the terminal.
---
Exactly!  Why would people spend the money to be less effective?
---
This just happened to my T-60 power armor. But the weird thing is it was in my inventory when i left the game.
---
Re: Dogwood Die Off
---
This one is pretty fast if you know where to get fertilizer.  There are usually 3 bags (all you need) in the chest in the top room of the building you will see to your left if you fast travel to the shooting range. Sometimes a Wendigo will spawn in that room.  If you are able to get all your fertilizer there, you can complete the event in about 5 mins or less.  The rewards are not very good though.
---
Not that your request isn't cool, but Deathclaws run like scared little children from Mirelurk Kings.  Used to do arena fights with trapped animals at Sanctuary in FO4,  I took one wall out of arena and pitted 1 Mirelurk King against 3 Deathclaws.  Deathclaws immediately ran and actually cowered wherever they could, to no avail.  They wouldn't even try to fight back. It was hilarious to watch.
---
Alright, tell me the issues the game has at its CURRENT STATE. Cause so far I’ve started playing again when wild Appalachia started and I’ve been having fun with no issues.
---
New Armor?
---
From what is known about them so far, it sounds like you'll scrap legendary gear for tokens that you can use to re-roll the legendary effects for a pre-existing piece of gear at the Purveyor. Haven't seen anything suggesting that you'll be able to create new legendary gear, let alone 4-5 star ones. 
---
But who knows?
---
Strange in numbers + full team = adernal reaction stronk
---
Yes.Look the main pic
---
Looking for Sentinel/Assassin BOS Combat Armor in return of these highly sought after weapons. I'll take a piece/gun or a set for your pick.
---
I'm a full Sentinal assassin build with all 4 points of refractor, max barbarian, max blocker, max ironclad, and max pretty much every other damage resistance perk. I'm a tank build through and through.
---
Future tip post the console in the title.
---
At least one of those pics made it obvious it was a full sized statue when I saw it.
---
Xbox, sorry.
---
To craft the recall card you have to buy a part from vendors that costs 2500 without hars bargain or 2000 with hard bargain.
---
Well, if you traded it away... I mean.. suit urself 🤣 never trust people mate!
---
Also thank you.
---
Lucky hole mine in excavator for lead to smelt.
---
Big Bend tunnel run, scrap all the weapons for steel.
---
Can you not read. I was never killed.
---
Yes, paying money to fix your gear that would normally take minutes or even seconds to do for free is unfair. Also my crystal ball says that it will definitely lead to actual pay to win because I don't have a job. Bush did 9/11 420 reeeeee.
---
Bloodied Explosive and demo expert
---
Nope.
---
Interesting reading. I have collected all the outfits in the game but I won't lie--almost all the rare ones I ended up paying caps for. I can definitely sympathize with the farming and appreciate you putting this much effort into writing this.
---
One thing--I'm pretty sure the "clean" cop cap is what always drops when you finish that one Responder quest at the airport where you're rewarded a Responder Police uniform. I've bought many multiples of that clean version (the one with the red stripe around the bottom) from vendors after players have sold theirs.
---
You should blast you Appalachia radio at inappropriate times and let your pet deathclaw poop on their lawn
---
Work on my camp and try to convince people to visit.
---
I mean, I feel like most of these anecdotes are just that. For every story about frequent crashes and disconnects, there seems another about how stable the game is. For example, I got disconnected twice 2 nights ago, but that was over like 5 hours of playing and I also had YouTube open on my second monitor. I haven't disconnected since.
---
Can't find gt m8
---
Bloodied PA in a rad Zone? I guess anything that helps against rads, Make sure you have emergency protocols, and dodgy in full swing the rads are going to be hard to manage as your optimal health is 20% assuming your nerd rage and adrenal boosting as well I would be really careful and make sure to bring ALOT of diluted rad away, your going to be popping in and out of optimal alot Stimpack over time effects will keep your health topped off so chem duration will help as well. Leadded Champagne, Radshield, and DILUTED Rad-X all help without killing mutations glowing blood pack etc.
---
I just want them to stop taking pot shots at my windows from the woods. :(
---
Right but if everyone had the mentality of "I'll just join someone's elses" then no one would initiate the event. Someone is laying this price no matter what.
---
We'll relay this feedback to the team. Thank you!
---
No problem. Its an honest mistake.
---
No but what's the difference between paid cosmetic DLC and the atom shop..?
---
I like the faction idea a lot.I would like to see commendations (another Reddit posters idea) that you earn for doing quests and challenges. Commendations allow you to rise in Rank. These commendations also earn you rewards in game like new weapons, armor, outfits, paint schemes, camp items, faction flags and decorations. 
---
Each faction should have a leader npc in-game that gives quests (Rosie, Modus, Etc).  They could be like daily challenges. For example: go capture a raider owned workshop, kill 1 BOS player, scavenge 100 wood for your faction, Build 10 pipe rifles for your faction, team up with other members of your faction and complete events. Obviously these would be related to your faction.
---
***Here are the groups I had in mind:***
---
\-Responders (+2 to INT,END, CHA)
---
\-Raiders (+2 to STR, CHA,LCK)
---
\-BOS (+2 to STR, CHA, END)
---
\-Enclave (+2 to INT, PER, LCK)
---
\-Free States (+2 INT, PER, END)
---
\-Unstoppable's (+2 INT, CHA, AGI)
---
\-Lone Wanderers-non faction choice  (+1 to all stats)
---
This could be done on the adventure servers after you complete the main quest line for a particular group. You could log in to a server a be the only faction player on there. Or you might have 3 responder faction members and 2 Free State faction members on a server. If you and your friends are all one faction or different factions you could log in to the server together and either join up or compete against each other.
---
Here are a few other ideas I had:
---
\-**Only allowed to be in 1 faction at a time**. I hate when games allow you to be in every faction.  This is important. If   
---
 you leave a faction
---
\-Only show up on the map for others in your faction. Everyone else is hidden.
---
\-Each faction town has build able camp locations right next to the main base. They could be pre existing buildings 
---
\-Each faction should have a safe area and base of operations. (Flatwoods, Top of the World, Harpers Ferry, The Asylum, Whitesprings Bunker, Rivers Mansion, Etc.) These are no PVP zones and would have areas for crafting, trading, etc.
---
\-The vendor bots give discounts if you are part of the related faction.
---
\-Instant PVP again factions aligned against you. They immediately show up as red threats.
---
Stop being willfully ignorant and just accept that of you want to start the event it is a 2000 cap entry fee.
---
Love him. Favorite part of the game. I would have belly laughter listening to him.
---
I mean, I don't know jack about Runescape but I get the gist. Personally I think there is a special place in hell for whoever fine tuned the RNG for these.
---
I'm not traditionally *good* at 76. I'm level 114 but don't have the greatest legendaries or anything. I'm all about making my camp the best and looking good doing it. From the beta, level 1 I made it my end game goal to collect these outfits. I've yet to see one and OP did a literal thousand events and got nothing. Even if I treated this game like a full time job I don't know if I could find these on my own.

Worth reading just for that.
---
As I said at the start of the post, its not about the repair kits. Its about the door opening for more non cosmetics. Depending on how legendary tokens work, maybe they will decide to sell tokens in the atom shop. Maybe when players go legendary in the summer they will sell perk packs in the atom shop. Do I believe it is where its heading? No. But I would prefer to nip this in the bud, and not allow the possibilities to exist.
---
&gt;unwashed little bridge dwellers

No set bonus no.

Normal server issues.

It's the Far Harber Diver Suit from Fallout 4
---
Exactly what I did. I didnt look at any reviews etc. I did wait until feb to get it with the hopes most bugs would be fixed but hey its Bethesda + online lol cant ask for diamonds after you just got gold i suppose
---
Gnarled Shallows has 3 that spawn, then follow the stream North and you should find another 3
---
Welcome to PvP.  If you don't like centering your build around PvP, then don't take workshops.  If you run across someone who kills you repeatedly, then admit that it's his workshop, not yours, and go take a different one.  That's the entire *point* of PvP.
---
The only special bonuses are +100 carry weight in a full excavator set or double mining yield with excavator arms.
---
I'll be honest, I have had a similar experience of getting many many drops very quickly at Whitespring and then other times being able to barely get anything.  BUT I've never ever ever gotten any TSE or even TS in almost 400 hours of gameplay.  My only TSE was from a trade (probably duped but a man has got to eat).  My best weapon I got on my own is a 2\* furious combat shotgun, which compared to what most high levels run might as well be a bb-gun.  Maybe I'm just not dedicated to the grind the same way as other people are but I feel like I really have not received the blessings of RNGesus.
---
Upload to imgur or something and then post a link :) Curious what it is...
---
It's actually only 280 (5mm and .50) if super duper procs. Super duper only applies to the base ammo amount before ammo smith.
---
lmao, no one is forcing you to not take your time and enjoy the content....
---
I counted 26 solo kills in 5 minutes today, plus a buttload that I either put a big dent in or finished off while the tanks were chasing the 'squatch around like headless chickens. It's not about how awesome I am or how big my appendage is, as someone else suggested (don't have one, I'm a woman). I've seen and heard more than a few complaints the last few days about non-melee characters in the event. It gets old hearing how every player who's not a tank is clearly just freeloading for xp and loot, and I think it's made me a bit defensive. Melee might be OP, but it's certainly not the only effective way (or always the best way) to kill stuff.
---
Not everyone does melee, or is visible on the battlefield. Doesn't mean they don't contribute, and it certainly doesn't mean the melee players do the lion's share of the work. You just don't see us doing it - but if you did, we wouldn't be very effective snipers, now would we? ;P
---
Whoops i forgot yes its 3 star bloodied explosive and i also have level 5 demo
---
Except no one is able to "nip this in the bud, and not allow the possibilities to exist" we've had endless posts, a MOD sticky post, thousands of comments. Bethesda has said nothing. We don't even truly know what we're trying to nip. It's all speculation, which I for one am tired of seeing in so many posts.
---
Can anyone tell me how the hell I do the mission to fight the robot sheepsquatch? I did all of the quests that lead you to that place with the pylons but then it just ends. What do I do now? I dont know where to ask this.
---
What we need is the various factional holotape and robot voice actors making ongoing event announcements. And instead of adding it into the existing radio station(s), you make a separate Appalachia Public Radio Station complete with NPR-style old-timey banjo-y interstitial music stings between announcements.
---
Stranger in numbers has been halving my damage

Check your "species privilege", dude. In Super Mutant culture, being shot in the face with a rocket launcher is a sign of respect and a request for an open*, fair*, and woke* conversation between equals.
---
(*In the Super Mutant culture, all of these words translate into "murder")
---
Int. does not increase XP gain in this game. And I was under the asumption int. gave you higher conditions on item you craft the higher your int.
---
I can't even remember anymore. If you're on PS4 I can open the dome for you tho.

The alien blaster is in a broken safe in the middle of a destroyed house in the water.

5* Junkie's explosive gear ftw
---
Great. Now make that work in a heavy weapons PA build when you don’t have enough perks left to also go for reliable stealth crits in VATS.
---
Even if you could make the perks work, the weapons alone cause the biggest problem. You can’t even use the minigun at all because you’re dead before it spins up. The .50 cal and Gatling have no aiming reticle and because of high AP cost you can’t spam these things in VATS to make up for it. You ever try eyeballing a player with one of these things when they’re bouncing between trees and buildings with marsupial? Good luck. Laser Gatling and plasma Gatling? Same problems as the minigun. The only viable one really is the MG42 because it’s treated like a rifle but you have to hope you don’t miss or it’ll eat through the magazine so fast you’re dead while you reload. Plus all the heavy guns slow you to a crawl while you fire. Then you’ve got the PA making you a giant target the blind kid from Dumb &amp; Dumber could hit if he was aiming in the opposite direction of the continent you’re standing on.
---
The other weapon types don’t have these mobility, aiming and AP issues. If you’re playing on console like me it’s even worse because you can choose to either have high ADS speed or accuracy thanks to the virtues of a controller. It’s a complete shit show.
---
Sorry if it's your first.
---
Plural possessive is (generally) different than you're stating.  Jon Wesley's House is correct.  If there are 3 Wesleys, it is the 3 Wesleys' house.  (And no, there aren't 3 Wesley's).

---
I'm guessing bethesda fired you for wanting to do storylines and not the atom store. You need to get your programming degree, start a studio and then take my money so I can play your game. My sympathy.
---
Or just have a like 30 minute demo for items so if you don't want it anymore, you can return it.
---
No. Mine was stuck for almost 3 months. Recent patch fixed mine. As long as you're now getting the dailies pop up in toxic valley like see the chef or sink the barrels it will show. Just server hop until it shows up
---
Damn that sucks... oh well hopefully some one else will chime in that’s on ps4
---
Make sure you have a recall keycard. Go on terminal in cabin. Select "initiate recall." If it does not start, that means it is on cool down. I believe it's a 3 hour cool down for the event, meaning you'll either have to wait a while, or jump to another server and try again.
---
That would work too.
---
I consider myself a tinker/sniper.  I roll with maxed perception, intelligence, and agility.  I have a leaver action and PA that I made myself.  I can pretty much build or fix anything but since I'm not the strongest in a fight, I need to hide in the shadows as best I can.
---
That's true. I just think there are a lot of benefits for Bethesda to give themselves a more realistic schedule, and it would give average players who don't game all day but still want to join in on new things when they're released (especially if they play with others in a Discord group or whatever) a chance to actually take everything in.
---
\&gt;  "take a picture at 4:29 in the morning standing on top of a broken  police car's siren while wearing an empty power armor frame and being  chased by a deathclaw with 10% health 
---
And I'm over here thinking that at least one challenge a day should be something ridiculous like whats above and award like 100 atoms if you can actually make it happen.  Hilarity would ensue, I assure you.
---
Allow me to explain. Instead of charging outrageous prices for individual items they could only offer packs of items for a fairer value. Or another option is to cut out the fake currency. You could for example, tier items as low, medium or high value. So for 5 bucks you can like, get 3 low value items, one medium and 2 low, or 1 high and 1 low. As it is now, you can spend 5 bucks on atoms and literally not be able to buy a singular cosmetic item in a fucking video game. I just think they should structure it to be a little more consumer friendly, assuring value for the loyal money paying customer. Probably would get them better press within the community. The way it's structured now is insulting. It's true that all players of the game can earn free premium items just through gameplay but that shouldn't distort prices for paying customers in the shop. It needs a re-work.
---
I have bought some items from the Atomic shop that I think I will use and just end up not liking how it looks, but it's too late at that point.
---
Interesting...  
---
It says its a new gamemode so Battle Royal honestly wouldn't surprise me
---
You literally get a preview before you verify your purchase, though. How many chances do you need?
---
Ugh, that sucks. Good luck.
---
I think they should add legendary PA frames with small, but appreciable buffs. 
---
Not sentinels or assassins, but things like increased jump height (marsupial style), decreased stamina drain from running, jumping, power attacks, etc.
---
I think that would keep it from being too too op, but give pa users something to work towards and optimize.
---
Thanks I’ll give that a try!
---
Oh they'll give you your treat all right. In the form of delicious, life-sized Sugar Bombs!
---
Yeap real damper on the day. Thanks though. Back to whitesprings
---
I would definetly like to expand on the bonuses for each Faction. I think if it is rewarding to be in the groups most people would join one.  If not I put in the Lone Wanderers for people who like to solo. 
---
It would be nice if we could have at least 2 groups that have alliances with each other. That way there could be more interaction that is Lore friendly to Fallout.
---
I'm more impressed with the data mining abilities of some than the new upcoming content heh.
---
Yea
---
Yeah I can. Free of charge - kevo0788 psn
---
This can happen in any area of the game. I've had happen multiple times in different areas, but Quit to Desktop and reload has always solved it for me. You may want to verify your game files as well if you haven't already.
---
Ok so ya, you just want cheaper prices. Lol I mean I wouldn't be against cheaper prices that's for sure.
---
Also hand scanners work in power armour
---
I'd recommend 2 pieces of Chameleon regardless of the other types. I only have one atm and I got screwed today when it broke and I couldn't snipe properly anymore. So a backup is advisable ;D
---
Only reason i can think if too pvp in pa is pain train.  To many good legendary effects on normal armors.
---
If you want those people who are commenting to respond to you, you have to click/tap on the reply button and not start a whole new comment chain
---
Ha, I’m still holding out for the last few weeks or Wild Appalachia. I hope Wastelanders is good
---
If you're on PS4 and need someone to trade stuff through or whatever, hit me up. I always need to trade things to my alts, too.
---
You can scoop a hard copy for about $15 these days online. I've been thinking of buying a copy for all my friends that haven't given it a chance due to the launch hate.
---
I was expecting a freshly baked potato when they say hot potato but all I got was a face full of nades.
---
I have a complete troubleshooter armour set  (one piece w/ sentinel as well), scaly skin, and grounded.  The adds don't even tickle.  I have to use 2-3 stimpacks a minute going toe to toe with the ISS for however long it takes.  The pylons will drain me fairly quickly though.
---
My equipment is not all that great in general but the troubleshooter set seems to work well here and in the silos.
---
Interestingly enough my suppressor power fist does not seem to make much of a difference against the ISS, but seems great against other non SBQ bosses.
---
Just working and not paying much attention
---
Yeah that's the simple version. I don't think the atoms thing should change for the free players but I do think if your actually paying extra money outside the games price then you should get more value than they currently offer. For 20 bucks or whatever I'd rather spend it on a million other things.
---
I am on PS4. Its hard to find someone trustworthy, but yeah I hear you you can dm me your PSN. Trying to prepare for this legendary vendor
---
You think so? For me compared to the other games they're chumps in this game. Besides kings and queens.
---
What were you doing in the face tattoo area?
---
I have, unfortunately. I even did a full reinstall. It seems to only concern the Nukashine DLC.
---
Is the lying Lowe quest limited time?
---
Same here, been hoarding stuff for weeks now.
---
I can confirm that it's not just caused by explosive prefix weapons. I don't have any explosive prefix weapons and I get this bug pretty much daily. In fact, the only legendary weapon I'm running right now is a two shot laser rifle with the beta wave attachment (I think, whichever one gives fire damage).
---
Highkey doesn’t answer my question in any way, but I already figured it out as shown by the edit
---
Pretty much since Bethesda announced the road map ive been farming like a madman lol
---
Or a defend hmtype mission where we defend the deathclaw from the waves of scorched while fighting the SB
---
Same damn thing happened to me.   The response I get was that when you click on a special stat to browse what's available in that tree, it sinks a point in that stat even if you don't buy a perk in that particular tree.  In other words, if you click on agility but don't buy any agility perks, it puts a point into agility. They said this is how it's supposed to work but  I don't think that's true. 
---
And if it is. then it's a terrible design.
---
Both PvE and PvP players can make equal use of workshop resources yet taking them is only viable for people geared for one playstyle. A low level player in need of resources can get ass raped by some dude kitted for full PvP because he took a tiny farm with three things of corn and a puddle of water. That is flawed game design.
---
No, it’s October 23rd I believe.
---
Heavy weapons are certainly a different beast. I suspect the best heavy PVP weapons would be the flamer or cryolater plus stealth boys. The flamer seems similar to the Tesla rifle. Ammo is the only issue there.
---
I also think third person camera may be the only way to play heavy weapons. You should get a reticle then.
---
I use controller on PC btw. May explain why I like vats builds so much.
---
Lol...not the point. I aldo accidentally purchased the Wild Man wrags. I should really just stop browsing I guess.
---
That has never been the case. I used to always select the card that way and it would put the point in whatever card I selected.
---
You're invulnerable when you enter the world, for 30 seconds, unless you move.  Not even spawning in and falling will do damage to you, it can only cripple your legs (you stay at full hp).
---
I've never even seen an enemy when I load in.  Weird.
---
Workshops are consensual PVP don’t be a pansy about it
---
It's really.based on how hard or quick you hit, it pretty much made my TSE harpoon gun worthless. My new rifle build with sneak damage seems to be seeing the issue now too.
---
I respect your thoughts on the subject, but I must disagree.
---
As PVP is an important aspect of the game, a player in Power Armor stands almost no chance against a properly equipped player in regular armor.... regardless of how they set it up.
---
1 against 1, how can regular armor be better than power armor?
---
Makes no sense to me at all
---
Ty ty, this has been solved &lt;3
---
It’s hard to say because like other games such as: No Mans Sky it took years to redeem itself but the developers weren’t doing anything sketchy or shitty during that empty time. Where as Bethesda is kind of screwing the pooch with their decisions and making people hate them. So i think if Bethesda just listens to their fans and fixes fallout 76 in a manner that makes the game friendly to all those they disappointed then yeah I think it could be redeemed. 
---
Ps: I like the game so no redeeming needed here.
---
No? Word is you have to redownload the coordinates and it works again. Sorry if thats not the case and I mislead you.
---
Yeah I know that it  has never been the case.  But the responses I got on here were all looking  for a way to blame me instead of their beloved Bethesda.
---
I agree we need to be able to play with other consoles I have a friend who plays on PS4 and we can't play together sadly.
---
if i was going in a nukezone. cant i just clear all my rads for the time being and switch to my TSE weps?
---
is there a link for an extensive bloodied perk card setup?
---
This is definitely not correct, sorry.  If it were, I would be getting chunked by (insert anything here) with only two of these perks and no other defenses of any kind on.  I'm not.  I'm hit for exactly the %'s these perk state in differences.  Take off everything and take a hit from the same enemy with and without these perks.  It's pixel perfect %'s of reduction in damage right in line with the amounts these perks offer, up to a combined total of 95% reduction.
---
For me the mirelurks in 3 and new Vegas were terribly easy but in fallout 4 and 76 I’m having a bit more trouble.
---
That would be rad.
---
the toilet paper
---
I wouldn’t mind as much if my carry weight didn’t get all messed up getting back into my excavator PA. Dash boarding my Xbox every time I want to craft/repair is super annoying.
---
New "Dungeon". As someone who got frustrated and gave up on this game prior, is this the first 'Dungeon'? Have there been others?
---
Somebody activated the terminal on that server then. It has a three hour cooldown, everytime after someone started the event.
---
Party Hats in RuneScape were a hyper-rare cosmetic. Did nothing. Just a Burger King crown basically. 
---
Was one of the most expensive items in the game by a huge magnitude purely because of how rare it was. Personally, I think the existence of items like that make games more fun. I’m also not someone who. Ares about 100%ing games, so there’s that.
---
I just picked up the game for the first time and am experiencing the same issue, especially with the pipe revolver. I've restarted my game and ps4, but nothing has worked.
---
VATS is an integral part of the Fallout franchise. Its one of the things that makes it unique. It’s not going anywhere. 
---
There are dozens of PvP shooters that don’t have it. This game doesn’t need to be another one.
---
I mean, the tato could be from a survivor.  Not sure on how long folks have been dead but it could maybe work out.
---
For me the mirelurks in 3 and new Vegas were terribly easy but in fallout 4 and 76 I’m having a bit more trouble. But Kong’s and queens are hard regardless in 4 and 76 lol
---
Wait a minute, have you already been to the last part with the hatch and the pylons?
---
Why do you keep pressing the purchase button??
---
Yeah, if you have nothing you can multitask, it's as slow as listening. If I can loot, use some aid, re-equip, and periodically check the next line, I can streamline the interruption somewhat.
---
Last laugh should totally bypass any DR in a PvP sense...then it really would be the last laugh.
---
No. I didn't mean for my wording to imply that.
---
It's the terminal at the ambush spot not the basement.
---
I have a heavy sent/ass CA RA +1luck. I am interested in the bloodied lever
---
Do you know how many team mates are required?  I assume just one.
---
This is not an attack on you - but anyone that thinks their opinion of a game has value less than 24 hours after buying it.  You enjoyed a game the first time you played it?  Cool.
---
Go, you know, actually experience the game for a meaningful amount of time outside the honeymoon period and then let's talk about its merits and drawbacks.  
---
Trying to have a discussion about something you have almost zero experience with has no point or purpose.
---
I'm Melee... I have no use for ammo.. I have thousands of rounds. Are you on Xbox?
---
I was talking about the regular servers when the game first launched.  If you logged in at your base there was good chance that monsters were attacking it and you by the time your character loaded into the game.
---
 They changed it now to where your character loads way earlier than everything else around you. This makes it seem like your base takes forever to load into the game but it was just because you were there earlier than normal.
---
Sentinel Assassin BOS right arm?
---
This is 100% correct.
---
I tried using a flamer in PvP but like you said, ammo problems. It takes tons of resources just to make one fights worth of ammo. The damage is actually pretty good but ammo needs more or less make it unviable. I haven’t tried the cryolator with stealth boys but berry mentats would screw that over hard anyway.
---
I thought it was just me.
---
I know right
---
PS4 thanks for the offer tho!
---
oh no
---
I thought I was seeing things today, but yeah, they heal a good chunk of the damage back after I hit them. Ugh!!
---
Doubtful, it's just the C.A.M.P poster that's only available until the 7th?
---
No people would bitch because it's not single player
---
Ditto, same problem on XBox One since last update.
---
No worries, I just haven’t been able to play in a few days so wanted to make sure I still had a chance for this quest.
---
Did you put a space between OG and M?
---
Yes, but actually no. Todd Howard is having fun messing with us.
---
I got the plan as well. When you use it, is it a mod or actual rifle?
---
Same here. I tested it with my Ultracite PA today and it didn't make any difference. I think it is the same case with the explosive vents modification (in fact, there is not a power landing damage at all, even without the mod).
---
What's your energy res at? Also if your going to use stims get the intelligence perk that makes them up to 45% more effective. Add a medX into these as well.
---
Approaching 1000 hours.
---
Theres a lead and junk location in toxic valley
---
Yeah, I've tried everything. Fixing the files, fresh install, new character, computer restart. Nothing worked. It's really a shame.
---
OK well sole Survivor and bloodied hunting rie have gone. You want the be Lever?
---
didn't the last patch accelerate food spoil even more in prep for fridges?
---
400ish and I so use that perk
---
No, the golf club was part of the remodel.  The entire resort was remodeled.
---
Consensual PvP is fine. Imbalanced PvP is not. Cheers.
---
What's your Gt, I'm online now.
---
You feeling like you should get leet purpz all of the time isn't legitimate.
---
You owned a workshop consenting to that unbalance PVP cheers to you too buddy
---
It’s a random encounter.
---
Yeah, I would love to see these happen more often as well.  It would add a lot more atmosphere if they occurred on a semi-regular basis.
---
Fresh open grave(s) with ghouls lurking about is a random encounter that can happen anywhere a random encounter can occur.
---
Make it trigger when a player opens your inventory, like you crumpled onto a live grenade a la Red Dawn. If you get revived or give up it's cancelled. Mods can add the Nelson laugh.
---
That what we in the troll business call a cool story, bro.
---
The deer test is swerving and the vehicle flipping on its head not going through a fucking deer 😂😂glad your mom is okay but you're missing the point. You can learn a products flaws through others experiences you do not have to buy something to have input or boycott a product which is exactly why ratings and review exist. 
---
Nothing was blown of of proportion about 76 they weren't ready, lied about beta, slowly been pushing purchasable content with in game perks which was something they were against in the beginning.
---
 Only reason they've been held accountable is everyone online going insane or else Bethesda would have happily monetized mods and pushed for pay to win microtransactions. This reason alone is why the game sold a quarter as much as fallout because of players simply boycotting their direction of the company and product.
---
It's [always been the case](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9zjs8j/psa_when_you_level_up_the_perk_you_pick_does_not/). You pick a category, then the card. If you click Strength then cycle through and pick a card from a different SPECIAL stat, you keep the strength point you chose and the card (whatever it was) you selected. [Here's a video](https://youtu.be/UsEbq0jNxzY) of a guy choosing Perception, then cycling through to Charisma and picking a Charisma card.
---
I’d love a holotape I can choose to look at in game.
---
That is definitely not the case. At least on PC, anyway. I could see stricter limits on consoles.
---
Forget daily challenges.....  Spawn rates and found plans are why I server hop.

GT Unlikedmurderer
---
You can already make a few things into 4 star... Just need a mod that adds an effect to an [item.ie](https://item.ie). Machete has a mod called sacrificial blade. It increases damage and adds the effect of bleeding for some amount of time on the enemy. Since it has an effect, it's treated as a star. So if you put it on a 3 star machete, you'll have a 4 star machete. I'm pretty sure the legendary players will have an overall effect with a star added next to their names. I'm not sure "becoming legendary" will affect the weapons themselves at all. 
---
I think the legendary vendor will bring 4-5 stars. Being able to re-roll/add effects to your current weaponry.
---
It was before they took the server down again lol
---
Can't wait for the -50 comment going "WTF! THAT'S NOT FALSE ADVERTISING"
---
the perk system is initially confusing.   
---
I had the same problem - Strength is default 1st choice, when the select a perk screen comes up, if you hit accept before back (then select the category), your point goes to strength.
---
You will evntually be able to assign a card to those points, but it will take you several more levels to do.
---
I ran with 3 unused points in Str for 20 or more levels before I got it worked out.
---
I'm hopping on now. I'll join you and meet up at 76, cool?
---
For the event? 10!! XD No seriously, it’s pretty hard. Last time we were like 7-8 people (not all friends, also some randoms) and we failed... it’s all about the mechanics. There are three pylons you have to activate to do damage to the boss.  And a lot of people just don’t do it and shoot the boss while he’s invincible...
---
We have some others too, the enclave plasma rifle has a set name and is painted black with the enclave logo on the back. Then there is the brotherhood recon rifle which is just a heavily modded bolt action rifle but is a set name. The anti scorched training pistol is another with ultracite ammo and unique name again. There are probably more but I am away from the game.
---
lol I wish dude. I've had a passion for writing for a while and the fallout universe just captivates me. I've watched lore video after lore video.
---
I spent my entire time playing managing my weight. It sucked and ruined the game for me. I could barely move around. Travel was limited and sucked up most of the game time. Poopy
---
No team mates are required.
---
Good to know!
---
Lol wish I could figure out how to mod / had the time to do it (work and all) I'd throw this on a private server
---
It happened everytime after using my automatic Tesla rifle. Went from quickly killing groups to them going down to a sliver of health and jumping right back up. Glad I'm not the only one seeing this
---
I really wanna TP someone's Camp now...
---
And there’s no perk cards that reduce that drain specifically. There’s an INT perk that extends power core life, but that’s a hell of a stretch to say “reduces Ap cost while crouched or sneaky”
---
Damn Super mutants.. Lying all the time..
---
I hear you get 50 fuel for scrapping a flamer. I suspect you can make it viable if you get your ammo through making a scrapping them verses just making the ammo. I need to look up material costs though.
---
If I had to guess, I'd say Nuclear Winter won't be quite this but it'll be in the same ballpark. I bet that's some kind of world-changing event.
---
I haven't been able to add a vendor bought mod to my sledgehammer,  yet the Atom store paintjobs for my PA go on fine.
---
I think it’s build dependent honestly. We all know melee users benefit the least from power armor.  They are also hurt the most be using PA because armor can add strength to their stats greatly effecting their melee damage.  Also, vats users and crit builds are greatly effected by using power armor because of all the great vat stats on normal legendary armor.  Fast forward to my build, explosion shotgunner with AAE and IE shotguns.  I don’t use vats at all.  Normal legendary armor doesn’t buff me at all as I don’t pvp and I have no reason to use sent/cav armor because nothing does enough damage to you or survives long enough.  For my build I find power armor incredibly over powered.  With mutations I have 600 DR and 650 ER? Lol things tickle me.  
---
Again it’s all build dependent.
---
I am level 150 and have seen 0 radstorms.
---
Bethesda plz.
---
Are you 100% positive on that? What’s your source?
---
And I said the second bit.
---
What's your GT?
---
Still messed up. I've gotten a syringer and on occasion, nothing from legendaries :(
---
They notified everyone on the home screen the night before
---
Yes she is, Abigaile Singh, the actor is Richa Shukla.
---
This is true, and actually this is the one place where temporary buffs actually affect that as well. Temp buffs to charisma allow you to share higher star perk cards for the duration of the buff
---
I've never seen a TSE in almost 1,000 hours of game play.  This is my second explosive shotgun from real drops (first from Uranium Fever and now Whitespring), both pumps.  The first was probably 80 levels ago and I gave it to a much higher level friend since I mainly killed myself with the danged thing.  I bought my TSE handmade from an in-game vendor and I have mixed feelings about it though it's almost a necessary evil.  I leave it at home except for the SBQ, AWOL and now the Cryptid thingy though I'm generally a conduit there.  I'm considering going to one of my alts and using just what the game supplies, nothing purchased from player vendors such as weapons, armor, or mutations.  It might prove interesting.  It would certainly be a more 'pure' experience.  I'll get down off the soapbox now.
---
Keep a stealth boy on your quick wheel and use it when a scorchbeaat shows up. Then sprint like you’re an obese kid avoiding their parent taking them to fat camp. It’ll allow you to reliably escape them. Stealth boys have some set spawn locations so look those up and keep farming them until you’ve got a couple handfuls.
---
Yup. Got a few syringers from legendaries recently.
---
I suppose that's fair, in some ways.  But It's more than just the name.  I'm more interested in what they can come up with to give us for...non-standard legendary effects.  Keeping things like that balanced while at the same time keeping them interesting is quite a challenge.
---
Yeah my camp is there and I see him every time I return to the game now.
---
Richa Shukla is the actor name, She is a good voice
---
So it starts an event? Is it that one that talks about an cryptid attack? Or is that a different event?
---
Technical issues are better.... Most of the time.... Brand new content brings players out of the wood work and with everyone server hopping things are a little funky this week.
---
Just started it about 3 nights ago. I love it so far. Haven't come across anyone yet though.
---
That's it
---
Sent
---
World full. In que
---
My go to weapon is a furious handmade. Still holding out for something better.
---
7)  Don't sweet it, it's the duper's trying to grief people.  
---
8) They fixed it once, will be fixed again.  
---
10) Ouch, talk about a painful bug... but you recovered most/all of it?
---
Happening here too. Az well as the no damage bug. 7 vats shots at 95 percent to one level 5 liberator and no damage at all. It was working so so well before this last patch.
---
I'm just glad someone can give it to them. 
---
I think their should be a soft "griefer" report option.  Then, if a person consistently gets this report from a consistent reporters, (ie not hit
---
Griefer everytime someone kills you fairly) you start getting primarily grouped in servers with only other reported griefers.
---
Every online game should have this option.  Make an algorithm, test it out, refine it, but this needs to be developed.  I wonder how many people have given up on games because their early encounter was with someone whose idea of fun is making something less fun for others.
---
tbh for 100 atoms I wouldn't even mind challenges like this
---
As a game developer it’s their job to make the game competitive and balanced if they’re going to have PvP. I’m not going to apologize for wanting a fair game where a wide variety of options are viable instead of everyone being pigeonholed into the same garbage. If you’ve got a problem with that then too bad.
---
What mods are you looking to put on it? I have a handful of them unlocked
---
Unyielding Power Armor, awwww yeeeeeeeah
---
Rarest outfits in my opinion: Leather coat, traveling leather coat, forest camo jumpsuit, Whitesprings jumpsuit, White Powder jumpsuit, Responder Firefighter Outfit and Helmet (not Fire Breather), BOS Jumpsuit, Western outfit, Western outfit with chaps. Certain Asylum outfits are reasonably rare (red, pink, yellow, forest seem to be much rarer than the rest, none of the Asylum hats are rare). I'm probably forgetting some other outfit that should be included in this top tier.  
---
Step down in rarity would be the uncommon outfits only sold randomly by the traveling Responder vendor bot like the Hunter's Longcoat, clean straitjacket, Winter Jacket and Jeans, clean ranger outfit and hat, Skiiing red and green outfit, longshoreman's outfit, and a couple of others I'm not remembering right now.  
---
Witch costume isn't rare because there are plans available to craft it.
---
Give it a min... If no luck invite me.
---
Anti armor melee or explosive shotgun.
---
How bout the fact that it still crashes pretty consistently.  Have multiple support tickets in for items disappearing from inventory, dropping mutations randomly.  Are those enough issues?  Not saying the game sucks, far from it.  They have come a LONG way since day one, we appreciate the work that has gone into it,  happy you're having a good time, but some folks still have issues from time to time.
---
Still within a week of.
---
Awesome Quest, but disappointed with the bugs that came along with it. Hopefully they get it worked out soon
---
Name is Born a Turk
---
I'm always in full servers on PS4. I always run into lower level players that I help out and drop supplies for or upgrade their stuff if they haven't learned a certain plan.
---
I personally thought the story was jumpy and didn't explain itself well.
---
None are *required*. I haven't heard of anyone doing a true solo yet, but it's a virtual guarantee that everyone on the server will pop in for a chance at the loot when the announcement goes out that it's started. I wouldn't recommend starting it if you're alone on an empty server.
---
Instigating Deathclaw Gauntlet is my go-to for most tough enemies. It's what you'll find me swinging when I'm running through Whitesprings. When I'm in safer zones, I'll use a 10mm or combat shotgun. Moderate areas, I'll whip out my Handmade sniper rifle or my Lever Action. Fighting a high-HP enemy like a scorchbeast, I'll probably use a Gauss Rifle when it's flying and a Furious Power Fist when it lands.
---
Yeah what's the deal? 
---
If you have a patch you check it on all platforms before releasing, easier said than done? I'm guessing they need to up the preventive measure process that causes these bugs, programmers did things they shouldn't have or just working to fast? QA process? I wonder if the engine F76 runs on is difficult to work on?
---
If I worked at Beth I would stay after hours and HotFix the boom you get when selecting Adventure mode lol Beth support wanted me to fill out a ticket lol I'm like are you kidding me!? just fix it already, it would take longer to fill out the support ticket then to fix the issue :)
---
Oops. I stand corrected. Thanks!
---
I duck into the shed, close the door, and pray like the little kid in sleepy hollow, that the monster will just pass me by😂
---
Nor once did I get baked either!
---
IMO it's good now. I have no problems.
---
&gt;As PVP is an important aspect of the game, a player in Power Armor stands almost no chance against a properly equipped player in regular armor
---
100% correct, can confirm, a well-arranged set of legendary armor will outperform power armor every time. But I think there's a deeper, systemic issue in that the game is not at all balanced for PvP; that component feels very much like an afterthought.
---
If you play games like Destiny, even when PvP is one of the core pillars of your design it's *still* maddeningly difficult to properly balance PvP and PvE. The Bungie guys are really, really good at PvP design and they've got decades of experience, so if it's still a challenge for them I have my doubts whether Bethesda is ever going to find a good way to balance those two aspects of 76.
---
Considering it has always been great (even with the bugs), of course it will be good months from now. It has only gotten better.
---
Actually it does increase with Level but you have to move it before it takes effect. People have had full budget then moved their camp after gaining levels and the stored budget was no longer full.
---
Yeah having some people focus on the adds really helps a lot.
---
Your amazing! I should be on in a little while hopefully
---
People are report around 3 hour cooldown but no one knows what it actually is.
---
Luck?
---
Level 135 and I’ve seen three. All of them lasted like 20 seconds. Useless.
---
If you like the toaster, go watch red dwarf, that is where the idea of the toaster is from but less evil if I recall correctly.
---
Only saving grace of "you can't do that in power armor" is no more accidentally sitting (or laying down) in the middle of a battle.
---
Damn, not sure what else you could even try at this point. I've stuck to melee weapons because of it, which obviously puts me at a disadvantage and isn't even my style of play. Truly frustrating.
---
Boy the feeling when 3* greenish flaming enemy drops a drill or syringe. Makes my day everytime
---
Finally!  This explains the message I saw briefly when I bought and "learned" the salvage assaultron head...that I could already craft.
---
Didn't show up as known, but then when I clicked it, it said I already knew the assaultron head, but learned the imposter head...which didn't make sense, as I hadn't done any of the Sheepsquatch quest yet!
---
I play on Xbox so options are limited. I have radaway diluted mapped on the quick wheel.
---
As a game consumer it’s up to you to know what you’re getting  yourself into and what you want to do in the game you bought,  Game developer has responsibility  to balance PVP that’s why it’s only at the workshops,  and a separate server  pvp has been adjusted and will continue to be adjusted you’re just impatient. Claimed consensual PVP zone knowing damn well workshop PVP is broken
---
Cosmetic and Plan drops:
---
Most common seems to be:
---
White Wolf Fedora
---
The Fixer (Plan)
---
Assaultron Head (Plan)
---
Sheepsquash Mascot Head
---
Sheepsquash Mascot Outfit
---
And the rarest ones seems to be:
---
Sheepsquash Impersonator Helmet

Sheepsquash Impersonator Outfit

😂😂😂 *you had your turn in Appalachia, human!*

I always thought that the treat was the missile? I feel cheated now !
---
Don't apologize, rather have something mentioned a dozen times than missed!
---
On xbox ill.open it for u as well if you need it
---
I can agree with this. Was purchasing something free from the shop, next item came up and i thought it said free only to realize after buying it was a few hundred atoms. even games like fortnite have a limited amount of purchase returns, for in-game currency.
---
I thought nuclear winter was just gonna be a BR survival kinda thing? unless that was a meme and I read too much into that lol
---
I wish they would blend the Colonel Gutsy banter with Supermutant banter
---
Could you imagine the “does someone need me to kick their ass” in a Kermit voice?  That would be AWESOME
---
I've done a lot of Whitespring grinding over the months since launch. One thing I feel makes a difference is the amount of high level players. When I go it alone it's almost always 1* legendaries. If I'm with a group of teammates the same level as me we almost always seem to get 2* and 3* enemies to spawn there.
---
What SarcasmSpren said!
---
Server hopping doesnt work for world items
---
“Inspect” screen??
---
My last one was at 3:40 p.m. est
---
You have to buy it in the atom shop
---
Bye.
---
For what game?  I'm literally watching it not be correct in 76.  Have fun with your "correct" explanation.  The game doesn't work like that.  Don't bother arguing, anyone that even tries to test it in game will see it's not right.
---
I put two ranks in good with salt today as I harvest cranberries and they often go off if I get side tracked and by the looks of it they started to spoil very quickly,this latest patch is not right in so many things that are not working as intended.
---
Well yes I understand your point 100 percent. However, I was told that roght from the get go I would experience trash and I was suprised that wasn't the case at all
---
The server I was in with a friend was indicating server not responding quite often. So maybe that was the issue..
---
Is it really big enough of a deal to post about it. Just hit the back button and continue
---
Same on all counts.
---
Also in that safe you will find the rusted key that starts your journey on getting the TNT Key 2
---
It's all just speculation at this point, all we know is that it will offer a "whole new way to play and experience a different type of wasteland."
---
Xbox one here , but I will try it thanks man
---
Glad its just not me having my game crash an absurd amount of times.
---
Well you either put a 3 hour timer on when you finish the event or you hop. Tbh I’ve only twice the last days stayed for a second event on same server.
---
Bye guy
---
You are not alone. The area seems almost devoid of legendary bots now.
---
Played hundreds of hours at launch and a few dozen since I came back.  I've had bases pretty much everywhere and have never once logged into it under attack, or been under attack myself.  Guess I'm just lucky.
---
A Deathclaw plushie would be sweet!
---
I have noticed if you pick up a plan then server hop and look in the same place another plan doesn't tend to spawn there for 24hrs regardless of it being a world object, they are still a first come first serve deal in each world due to others knowing the same spawn points, but if you know exactly where a plan spawns and after 24hours it's not there again, server hopping will eventually find you a plan in that spot providing another player didn't get there before you.
---
Totally agree, companies can and do change policy all the time.  The iissue is their stated policy is what players like, and the (apparent) new policy is leaning very much towards a policy the players don't like.
---
I hate overreactions, and there's been a lot of that here to date, but I will say I'm in agreement that this isn't a direction I would personally like Bethesda to take.  If it's repair kits (and assuming they don't make thing break easier in tandem), and nothing else, I'm not going to care much.  If they start, say, offering XP boosts, tokens for the legendary vendor (whatever that ends up being), or outright selling gear/weapons, I'll be heading out the door, as will a whole lot of other (former) FO fans.
---
It's a region :)

yep.  I've come to dread turning a corner there and running into a low level player.  It becomes 'pipe pistol day' lol.

They still need to fix the dead body falling through the world.

I am sorry it went this far buddy, hope to see you around someday in the game :(

The rusted key unlocked the door on the roof of Freddy Fears House

Right on I saw on my xb app. Might not b able to hop on tonight but available tomorrow

Shhh...Another secret nerf that was badly needed. Lmao
---
As someone who is playing other games to fill the gap, they definitely should not slow down. I dont think they need to go faster, but the pace is great.
---
You can make it there without going up a single level, so, yes.
---

Great work and love your writing style. Enjoyed reading all this. You should write more.
---
I won't be on till Monday but just drop me a message when you're on and I'll give you a bunch of stuff what lvl are you btw
---
It is for sure a fun game, I guess I just kinda burned myself out on it. There's not much content left for me to do :/ if any really. I'll probably come back and play once the pacifist mode keeps you from being hurt completely since the whole broken PvP system was kinda my biggest turn off. I usually try and wander around helping out lower levels myself but on Xbox no one seems to either trust or care for you so I end up dropping supplies for no one. My friend really despises the survival food/water mechanics but I kinda like it, besides I'm super stocked on stuff if anyone ever needs any help. Send me a message on Xbox!

The loot tables continue to be epically screwed up, but don’t you worry “we are aware of the issue.”  Aware and action being on opposite ends of the spectrum.
---
Couldn't agree more. Allow me to flag events.
---
Awesome, just wanted to check before trying and getting my ass handed to me.

I could also set up turrets at White Spring resort or some other good spot for farming and tag those too, but I'd rather kill mutants myself.

This is the most reddit post I’ve ever seen

Try some X01 sucks at PvP but it's high energy res helps in this event.
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed under Rule 5 and your post has been removed.
---
The plans are hardly ever the exact same the day after I might add, for example the day before I went to the same place at grafton steel, there was an armor plan there but not the bos one it was heavy leather I believe, but the armor plans were instanced in that exact spot each day
---
Are you sincerely comparing a vault door to a poster?
---
We should be able to "subscribe" to events and get a notification of when it pops up on our server, so whatever your favorite events are, subscribe and save... the day!

id be interested, jimnvalerie on ps4
---
I’m allowed to complain about a broken aspect of a product I buy. It doesn’t matter if 98% of it works. I’m entitled to a fully working product. Especially since 98% of this product isn’t how much actually works. The game is still glitchy and everything months later. The way it launched was completely unacceptable by even the lowest of standards.
---
So yes, I will complain. And I will continue to do so until the product is 100% satisfactory. Patience has nothing to do with it.
---
I use the three star good with salt in place of bloody mess until i fight something tough like the SBQ or the new sheepsquatch. It keeps my stuff good for several hours.
---
On a side note. I've been getting bots spawning at whitespring clubhouse instead of ghouls lately. 3 times that happened yesterday. Anyone else ever have this?
---
I'll add u when I get home from work in like 3 hours
---
According to the fallout wiki it suppose to lead to the tnt key, I’m not sure as I accidentally stumbled across it in the train yard a while ago. But something to do with that room leads you to the next location to get passwords?
---
Same issue on PC for me. No telling the cause though with PC sometimes, so it could be unrelated
---
I think so, in world stuff is first come first serve. I've server hopped for things and found plans/mods in the same spot, same day.
---
Yeah the same for one, it stagger every ten second in the main menu too, it is unplayable like this I hope they fix soon
---
Melee is quite easily the easiest way to play this game as it’s hugely overpowered. It sounds like a mixture of Bethesda bugginess and you lacking deep understanding of all the game systems. Sorry you’re frustrated. There’s definitely issues with the game maybe a break is in order. It won’t go anywhere it’ll be waiting for you whenever you decide to boot it back up.
---
Interesting going to try and replicate, thanks this is great info!
---
Do you know if there’s a plan for the Civil War Dress?
---
*for me
---
Well then the hook tape left by a resident stating they will try living in the golf club must be wrong.
---
You on ps4? WhatTheHeck1978
---
Yeah same problems for me hope they fix soon
---
Good it wasnt just me that got crap. I got 2 chems and some caps
---
When I was creating this theory I thought about this, and under the same concept this "VATS" it is not the same VATS we had before, and this FO certainly is not the same game we are used to.
---
But still, this suggestion is not about to remove VATS, it's about to modify it in PvP Scenarios to make the game run smoothly and erase the Q+CLICK meta.  
---
Thanks for answering
---
How many strikes is this for Fallout 76 now? How many outs? Ball game?
---
Thanks...  
---
Any change since the hotfix?
---
But not Halloween. I wasn’t attacking you, just correcting you.
---
sounds good!
---
Yea I did it from watching YouTube. The gun and key is in that safe. You can get some ammo and a plan to covert bullets from one of the domes. As I recall the dome door is found on a top of a building(not sure where) i think Watoga. But there is not a quest for that.
---
I’d love crossplay as much as the next guy, but it’s not an easy process to put in a game, especially if they didn’t plan for during pre production. Could take upwards of six months, but probably longer cause the servers aren’t exactly stable without it already
---
Was taking a friend through the main quest so he understood the event. He still found it tedious. And I was like dude I did quests back in the BETA it was terrible like the area you had to search for a quest item was a tad smaller than the nuke zone.
---
For the record I personally loved it as I pretty much found all clues on my own without any help. 
---
My friend just got so annoyed I just decided to hold his hand through it to show him what to read and listen to and where to go. I asked him at the end if he got the jist of the story. (With the reveal in the last holotape) and he was like yea I listened but I didnt get it.) 
---
So although I held his hand through it he didnt get it on his own I still had to summarize the story and then ofc he was like. «thats brilliant» 
---
🤷🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
---
2-3 hours of content a week is not "playing all day"... that's what the brew questline took... the mask event was even less time... dont think sheepsquatch is much longer if any. 
---
There is plenty of time for someone who doesnt play much to take it all in. If you havent played since release, you dont have much to say on it, b/c those of us who have beat everything besides the new content. So it is a reason for us to come back each week. It's not cool to punish the veterans just b/c someone is new and doesn't want more content.
---
I also learnt two things in this post
---
So sorry VATS doesn't work for you, but it works for some of the rest of us.  You're just going to have to deal with it.
---
Melee is actually a reasonable option! After I switched I had a big improvement in game (not having to scrounge for ammo before perk cards). Also if you keep an eye on perk cards there are some that really up damage. My super sledge is over 300 damage per hit with my perks and mutations. 
---
My biggest thing is that maybe you should focus more on just exploring, not worrying about “winning” or completing quests. There’s no real repercussion to dying, it’ll happen and you just try again. Explore, level  up as you will, and then tackle some quest lines. 
---
Again, I think you’re much too worried about dying and losing than just relaxing and enjoying the game. My best memories in game were from just simply running around the map and exploring, trying to find cool weapons and armor, piece together power armor, and just really enjoying the beauty of the game and the fun of exploring a new map.
---
I mean, you’ll probably still die a few times on the way. But if you make friends with someone you can just fast travel to them while they’re there. The mobs inside might be their level or just high level from the last guy through, though;
---
Sometimes my finger is faster than my brain.
---
Regrets
---
I know. I'm just saying not everyone trick or treats on Halloween. People w/ kids often go during the week before because of school schedules.
---
yeah im afraid so. but at this rate I can never use speed demon. :((
---
Is this a guide to follow? https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9z7mel/fallout_76_melee_build/
---
Nah xbox
---
I think the holotape games are random with magizine spawns
---
It’s From a magazine. Magazine spawns are fairly random. Just look up a map of magazine spawn locations and hit all of them
---
Hope you planning on coming back...
---
Yep, can confirm it was reduced.  You're not crazy.  At least not on this count!
---
Honestly I never use VATS outside of testing to try and replicate bugs...  
---
Wasn't sure if selecting a target via scope and then going into VATS would allow it.
---
PA is already strong and easy to get. If it weren't, people wouldn't use it. So if they want to introduce legendary PA, then there is some rebalancing in order, like for example power cores becoming very hard to obtain.
---
From what I understand, to get the plans I don't actually need to go into the building.
---
I have killed over 2k robots since Tuesday not a single legendary
---
The card just doesn't seem that good though, it just seems like they tried ripping right out of COD, but I do agree that it should be fixed...
---
I play solo as much as possible, the extra ap regen and damage resist is what I use it for, there aren't any cheaper perks that are worth using in charisma to me, I don't even bother changing it when I do team up.
---
If I could have zero in Charisma and Strength, I would, basically just the only perks that help with my build.
---
For one hand! I’m two hand, so it’s a little different, but similar!
---
Only trying to help and give an opinion so please don't get annoyed with me :)
---
There are few things hard to kill. Levelling up is fairly consistent as you follow the overseer's path and main/side/daily quests that come along with it. Throw in some events and random exploration, and you shouldn't have much grinding for XP at that level. 
---
As for weapons, there are perks that repair weapons better, and cause them to break less frequently. So as times goes on nbd. As for materials you should be constantly looting and scraping everything. 
---
You're definitely doing something wrong if you're having that hard a time progressing. Research more, and find out what that something is.
---
Best of luck :)
---
You could be hanging out at the pylons keeping them lit.

Diluted Rad-away for fast removal, sun kissed for slow removal, and I used to use toxic water or goo for fast restore to 20% after a death but I don’t really bother anymore, the rads will come.
---
Healing factor is good to have for this though. Diluted rads after healing factor only restore like 10%, so if you sit at 20% and rad-away at 10%, you’re back at 20%
---
I lost a ton marine helmets today using a container with nobody around. I hope that didn’t get messed up as well. Now I need to go find a bunch of rubber again.
---
If you do Mama Dolche's you only get chance to eat ONE before the other 4 spoil.
---
Kinda defats the purpose. The spoil rates can't be right atm.
---
Yeah, really neat mechanic IMO
---
I like the idea, could be fun!
---
Dolly sods workshop
---
Tested it over a number of runs (over 100 bots killed) since the recent update and I haven’t come across any of them.
---
The only reason I go there now is for lead and aluminium which seems a pity seeing as a lot of work went into the design of the place.
---
Whatever bro. Believe what you want, I don’t care. ✌🏻
---
Awesome. I just put serendipity into it myself last night, I was running four leaf clover, but decided being survivable was more important, also my crits are still doing 40% extra, just not as often, but I exclusively save crits for killing other sentinel builds.
---
I tested both of mine, and it's fixed now.
---
...but they also nerfed the damage by about 20%.
---
Why did you wait so long?
---
Also curious, my Gauss has perforating capacitors, I dont remember if it increases damage on paper, just armor piercing...
---
same thing here, cant attach charging barrel to tesla rifle or any mods to power armor
---
We can't forcibly stop it, but we can try to nip it by letting Bethesda know how we don't want non cosmetics in the atom shop.
---
I agree the posts are getting out of hand, and the MOD sticky post is where everyone should be posting about it now in my opinion. Its where I would have put my 2c if it was up when I made mine (long ago).
---
Don't you have to join the BoS to get the computer to give you the plans though?
---
WTF, THAT'S NOT FALSE ADVERTISING!
---
Something similar happed to me as well. I claimed the Dolly Sods workshop for the weekly challenge, and my first defend was against 3 scorchbeasts. My reward was 5 plans. Nothing else, just 5 plans. None of them were (known). 3 of them were outfits, couldnt tell you which ones now though, im not in the game now. I do know that i have the BOS jumpsuit, but i may have bought it at some point. Not sure.
---
Any proof at all? Not that I'm saying you're wrong but all my experience and everything I've read says otherwise.
---
I can hear it in my head. And it’s hilarious. Lol
---
And then you get people like me, doing events to get steel, lead and acid to make bullets. What am i missing !
---
It does work for me, I can use it as we all do. I just find it absurd and boring.
---
I got a t51 jet-pack plan from it.
---
Lemme see how much i have if you you jave .38 ill trade
---
When you level up, you have two “points” to spend. The first one will be your SPECIAL, the second will be your Perk. 
---
This is not at all well explained. 
---
But that’s how it works. If you just want to browse perks, once you find a perk you want, note it’s SPECIAL Requirement, tab back to the first screen, tap the appropriate SPECIAL, and then pick your perk. 
---
This is intentional. It’s just really not explained. Like a lot of things in this game ;)
---
I'm not trying to say only legendary players will find 4* legendary enemies, and then mod to 5*, but I believe they will release those enemies after they make prestige available.
---
It’s pretty tough at the beginning but you’ll get to a point, where all of a sudden everything seems to be waaaaaaaay more easy. You will unlock perks that boost item durability, increase quality of life, give you more damage output and so on and so on. I know exactly what you’re talking about but believe me, you’ll get over it and will have a very good time. (If you decide to come back and accept the challenge)
---
..we both run !!
---
Not trying to belittle your problems but you may have a machine issue. The group on ps4 i have run with last month, month and a half have not ran into any of these issues.
---
 i get a disconnect maybe once a week on one system but on my other system its never happened. Have a guy i run with started having severe issues last week he did a restore on his and cleaned it out and hasnt had an issue since.
---
Just a thought ya might try if you hadnt already.
---
Yes, I recovered all of it, but the chameleon thing and that Tesla bug are priority fixes for PvP players like me.
---
Hey... didn't mean to make this a discouraging post. No really. We can hope BGS ups the rates a lil bit. Til then keep going, either like I did (not recommended) or in between other things you're interested in.
---
Then feel free not to use it, but don’t advocate taking it away from others.
---
That explains why I can never find toilet paper anywhere.
---
Yep.
---
Right 😂😂 that’s funny tho probably was just impatient itch of being close to the finish and wanted to get it done
---
Great info, thank you!
---
Yes. Spawns on same random body where you can get plans for top hat and both civil war uniforms and hats.
---
Not that I saw. If thats the case I will wait a bit
---
Also are you sure you have adrenal reaction, the mutation? That is the only thing I can think of that is missing based on your numbers...
---
Did I say you weren’t allowed to complain?  You’re complaining about dying in pvp, not the other many broken things in the game, you can avoid pvp 100% in this game broken or  not
---
Because they clearly aren't coded the same
---
Yea I was like its improved as fuck and engaging. How can you find the Baa Baaa Black Sheep Quest tedious. Cant wait to do it on another character!
---
&gt;There are other ways to implement cap sinks (faction rep and items, for example).
---
As a reformed WoW player: if they ever introduce a faction rep grind in 76, I will quit this game for good. I can put up with a lot of things: bugged events, broken endgame itemization, hilariously unbalanced yet pointless PvP, ultra low drop rates for rare cosmetics, but faction rep grinds are where I draw the line.
---
I now think I was super lucky, but I got a rad storm with a glowing radrat at the second location of the new questline on launch day, when that was the daily. I assumed that was a scripted thing. Other folks have reported no storm when they did the same though, so I guess I just had fantastic luck (or the script isn’t robust enough in a multiplayer game)
---
I believe you need the military ID.
---
What's your luck and charisma?
---
This would be a good idea! But when I first read the title I thought u were talking about a different type of seed...
---
I recall the computer asking for an ID or something along those lines.  But I had already joined the BoS and finished their questline well before deciding to get that plan.
---
Just got a quad legendary quad broadsider
---
Funny story I actually preordered it and after hearing some of the stuff from B.E.T.A I cancelled my order. I gave into the hate for a while😒. Then I saw a notification from my news app about the Goatsquatch update or whatever it is called and read around the internet and saw that people were saying it was getting better. I went to go buy it but everyone was like "no it's trash, bro." You know the usual. I t was like I was a warrior pushing my way through a horde of heathens to get to the gold shiny. Lol jk I literally just said Fuck it and bought it after the employee after the store tried to convince me not to
---
The piles give odd thinks like globes, cans, butter cup parts, etc when harvested directly, but the extractors give you things ready to stash like loose screws, waste oil, raw ____, fiber optics, springs, gears... Basically everything except ballistic fiber, ultracite, or flux. There might be another I'm forgetting. It's nice to be able to build up most things without thinking then go target a specific mat while travelling.
---
Besides occasionally logging in and starting a new charactor. I went back to Fallout 4 and Im currently looking into the next mods coming out like F.L.O.R.A
---
Well I cant play for another 12 hours or so, so I guess I will look into it.
---
Bloodied is only beneficial at low health, check out bloodied bastard build, it should help a little
---
Yep... I bought the BGS Jumpsuit. Funny thing about buying though:  If you search the Marketplace there's a big difference in values. Consoles seem to have these down as commoditized, traded for caps, meta and non-meta legendaries and other outfits. Search for PC though and rare outfits are the most precious thing in the game, typically item for item trades (outfits or meta drops). I assume its b/c there are many more console players thus item availability.
---
He WANTS to reduce the BENEFIT of the perk. Doesn’t want to jump so high (all the time).
---
To OP, yeah, I’d guess 3x. 4x with Strange in Numbers... if not more. It’s high!
---
Sneaking perks, rifle with a scope, rifle perks. Take down the Mirelurk Kings from a distance.
---
&gt;If it is, you're going to need to actually present an argument
---
He did. Bethesda pretty plainly said what they intend to do. I can think of very few reasons why you would argue against what is so blatantly obvious. 
---
&gt; I think you just need to admit that you don't trust Bethesda anymore,  and learn to agree to disagree instead of portraying your opinion as  fact. 
---
Physician, heal thyself.
---
XB1?
---
This is somehow correlated to the fact that "workshop repair" is now live and differs from "repair kit repair" so the wording is different and you don't accidentally use a repair kit. 
---
It's so dumb that their broken promises lead us to not be able to core game functionality.
---
You are not the only one.  I'm the (not so) proud owner of both an accidental face tattoo AND THE PLAYTIME PA PAINT smh.
---
I now browse the store extremely slowly and deliberately, using only one finger :D
---
Got around 2000 38 , does 1 bullet for 1 bullet sound good?
---
Kristin had no idea how impactful that kick would be. Still doesn't!
---
thanks for answering.
---
Nope. If you take class freak off it has no effect. I bought all the serums I have so I can remove my mutations and put them back one by one to test. At the moment though as soon as you select a bloodied weapon it goes to the correct damage so I can live with that. Tse's are still varying a little but no where near as oftern
---
I'm on vacation now and going back on Tuesday. We can try teaming up then and help you level up some more :)
---
God damn I thought this subreddit was a lot more pessimistic about this game but I guess not. I have always found the game fun and thought it was undeserving of what  alot people said, that being said I also think the state that the game was realest in was unacceptable at best.
---
Very nice of you, thanks very much.
---
I got a 45 one.
---
There are only random people trying to damage boss. And some brave souls using pylars on their way.
---
You can't have tank withou healer mechanic.
---
Also sentinel is one of best damage protection awayble and I die in second there. No way to tank.
---
They were trying, i respect that, but this is still not the best what they can pull of.
---
let me know where your camp is.. I'll TP it LOL
---
Lmfao, I’d give you a gold for that trolling but I don’t give Reddit money. But thanks for the silver.

You have a fundamental learning and comprehension disability. You do not understand the words you use, and try to make up new diction. You try to pretend you’re intelligent, or have any idea what you’re talking about, yet praying that the echo chambers of Reddit won’t call you out on fundamental logical fallacies and inconsistencies. 
---
You don’t have a better understanding. You’re schizophrenic. You have created a magical fantastical definition for a word to fit a false narrative. And you think that the longer you keep it up, you can be right
---
The fact is that you are wrong. Premium content is not, and never will be cheating. It is a part of the game, as a premium, and by literal definition, not philosophical musings, you are wrong. You do not no what you’re talking about, and are factually wrong
---
In order to pay to cheat, you would have to spend money on something that would defraud others, and deprive them, or fundamentally break the rules of the game. I would concede almost to the developers making an “invincibility serum” that lasts 24 hours would be BORDERLINE. But none of the things that have even been suggested have any way to deprive players, since everyone can squire the in game currency. 
---
I don’t care about your made up game developing story, or your testimony of not only sucking at gaming, but at life in general. You are a liar, and a troll, and wasting everybody’s time. You are trying to defraud people with your fictional accounts and dictional misrepresentation. You are actually trash, because everyone that believes your lies is worse off as a person. 
---
Some games are pay to win. IOS games are very common, and even that one you mentioned are examples. But believing that being able to buy a better car or shirt in real life because you paid money for the upgrade equates to cheating, as you defined in your idiotic rants...well...I guess everyone must be equally poor and miserable in life as you, right?
---
I’m going to go ahead and end this. Originally I was replying because you were entertaining. That honeymoon effect has worn off. Since you are not up to par with even the most common dictionary, and are some kind of developmentally challenged for continuing to ignore simple simple definitions and the most basic logic, reaching out to conspiracy theories about paying for premiums in games, life, and in general...I’m just going to walk away. I truly pity people like you that seems to have Reddit as their only means to reach satisfaction. Good luck, please try to read and gain some knowledge and understanding. And try not to take these games so seriously.
---
Please feel free to respond by shouting into nothingness. I won’t be responding, but you can have the last word if you need it.
---
BGS, pls halp
---
PM me. I will do it.
---
The fo76map website may be of assistance, and I believe at least on android there are is an app or two.
---
I work a 9-5+ so i feel ya on that. But really though it hasnt been too rapid fire. we had brewing then fasnacht then it was like 2 weeks for survival then i think another 2 or more for this week's update. It seems more weekly now because technical issue have made them push things back.
---
Well that sucks. I was really hoping to be able to "decorate" my place like in FO4. As for it being included in our stash limit, that is good to know. Now to decide if I want to wait and see if they increase the limit or just get rid of everything I collected over the past few weeks. Oh well....guess I have something to do when I play today. LoL
---
I hope they understand those things down slow the pace down at all!!!! They need more they just don’t hear it enough
---
I've played every day since the B.E.T.A.
---
And I'm not talking about punishing veterans. I'm talking about fixing all the things that are still wrong with this game, and having a schedule that just gives players a bit more time to enjoy each content drop, while at the same time avoiding the issue where things are announced on a schedule but then delayed.
---
One time a lone Supermutant came to my camp and said "human want to play?" and he didn't attack me.
---
I took pictures.
---
Yeah, I’m an Xbox player and had a lot more luck buying those last few elusive outfits off the console marketplace than here at Reddit. That being said, I had a few nice folks here give me outfits/hats I needed after seeing my numerous “searching for” posts. That certainly never happened on Xbox market.
---
This hits too close to home
---
Right, but industrial purifiers are supposed to produce 60 an hour. Mine are producing far less than that.
---
It sounds like your hooked :) it's a grind that pays off with patience and time. Have the wife take the kids for the day (weekend) and get a plan on how you can get better as a player. This game will not give you the build, the guns or the ease of winning, it's definitely earned. If you need the quick kill god mode try Fallout 4 fully modded out.
---
Hang in there! :)
---
I'm curious, do they have big testicles?
---
I got 550 if you like to buy them psn; San79no
---
Hell I've had it happen [PC]
---
I agree...and like my title says...I fail to see how display cases and vendor trading are connected. The display stuff stays in our camp and is not accessible by anyone, where as the vendor stuff requires a bit more coding i'm sure. I have collected a few things, but at this point I am getting tired of playing match-maker with my stash to decide what to keep and what to toss. LoL
---
If you go play Fallout 2 you can have a talking Deathclaw Companion and take on the President of the Enclave together...
---
Ummmmm.... Can't figure out if this is Trolling or not...   
---
The repair is two levels deep now... :(
---
Dude... Look behind the counter.
---
The different purifiers have different rates of production, even though extra purifiers just provide storage.
---
&gt; I had clicked on endurance just to browse what was available and they said that this automatically sank a point into endurance because that is how it works.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; ​
---
&gt; So that's what they came up with.
---
It's true.  You select your SPECIAL point, then you select your Perk card.  They are separate selections, and do not have to be the same category.  When you first select your SPECIAL point it filters your Perks to that Special for ease of selection, but you can then change the filter and select any perk from any category (which you did).
---
Thanks for expanding on my ideas I’m glad you like it I’m thinking about making some concepts if you want you could make some too
---
Imagine a big Independence Day bash!
---
At a suitably grand outdoor location like in front of theCharleston Capitol Building, on the terraces around Vault 76 or in the gardens of the Whitespring, our vault dwellers want to throw a big party to celebrate Independence Day and their attempts to bring civilization back to Appalachia once again.
---
In the week(s) leading up to the party, players will be asked to scavenge and scrounge up the necessary food and supplies for a great 4th of July BBQ like corn, brahmin meat, hot dogs, Nuka Cola, alcohol, and scrap building supplies from wherever they can find it out in the wasteland.  They then turn in these items to a party planner bot in exchange for new recipes and plans for their grills and C.A.M.P.s.
---
In the process of gathering the necessary party provisions, players will come across several side quests based around rediscovering different West Virginians’ “ultimate” 4th of July fixings. One quest might involve investigating an old, blown-up roadside fireworks stand to work out the recipe for different kinds of pyrotechnics while another might be uncovering an uncommonly brutal family feud over who made the best potato salad in Appalachia.
---
On Independence Day, a big party would be thrown with decorations and free food and drink items. There would be a stage for music and dancing and lots of lights set up everywhere. Too many lights, really. Enough lights that it attracts a swarm of Mothmen. As the Mothmen attack, the players have to use their newly crafted fireworks to dazzle and confuse the flying fiends, blasting them with star-spangled artillery fire.
---
Also, there might be an old Communist Chinese plot afoot.
---
Bethesda's been responding to Customer Service inquires and admitting it's a known issue, should be in the next patch
---
Just what i noticed when i moved my camp it was all maxed out then i moved it to white springs and it blueprinted and stored everything and i had more room to build.
---
Wasn’t sure of the spelling or how you would know such a thing. There definitely won’t be any secret police kicking in your doors later tonight, I can assure you
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/98ayn6/_/e4fa2za?context=1000
---
That’s all I’m saying. We’ve done our part. Now we wait for Bethesda to react or implement. Then we react again. Overreacting can do more harm then good in these cases. We’ve already seen a drastic reduction in interactions by CM’s as every post they comment on circles back to repair kits bad tell me something to make me happy type of comments.
---
99% sure you need the military id to get the recon plan.
---
Can't say this is accurate.... 
---
Ummmm I'll be the first to admit they break something new with every patch, but they are also fixing more than they break....
---
I’m not OP but dataminers have proven luck and charisma have no bearing on RNG rewards in 76.
---
Wish I got plans lol
---
Yeah that seems to be the case. Oh well.
---
Button is behind the counter. Good luck with the rest of the side quests my dude, they’re full of that find-the-clues shit
---
If your on PS4 I can craft you any ultracite ammo if you supply the mats
---
I don't think 4 and 5 star legendaries will ever be available as a drop.
---
I've added you if you need someone to wander the wastes with. My names ibnome. You sound like a cool person to play with.
---
I appreciate the positive attitude. I appreciate the effort to dig up these clues too. There is only so much I think I can take. After going into the enclave bunker probably close to if not over a hundred times to get a xo1 jet pack. Half the Fasnacht Masks being extremely rare. Sometimes I think I paid too much money for too much grind. Starting to wonder if it’s not the sink cost fallacy that has me even keep going.
---
You should not be struggling like that. There are levels for each zone. Look it up. Stick to the beginner zone and unlock everything you can see on the map. It will open up quests and you will level up. When done with the beginner zone move to the next. Rinse. Repeat.
---
they could also cause irradiated flora like a nuke, basically make them a shorter lived weaker nuke zone
---
Not really regressions, just newly Introduced (or Re-) bugs...  
---
Will try to include it in the next roundup for Graphics etc
---
Not a bug... Look behind the counter. There's a red button. Boom.
---
Thank you. It's hard to miss that big red button bit it seems so that i did it.
---
Players can destroy turrets in Surface to Air? I shoot that turret all the time with explosive weapons and never kill it. How do they do it?
---
That tape said it was a long shot.  There’s another tape that said they had to leave.
---
You on PS4 cause I have plans for days to give away
---
if only we were on same platforms...I have 1000s of ammo saved up...my dude only uses shotguns and melee.
---
And you are 100% sure you deleted all the fallout76custom.ini files? Even the one everyone forgets at c/users/user/documents and settings/my games?
---
Maybe they tried to fix the legendary robot explosion timing and accidentally wiped them all? Lol
---
lol thanks, you'd have to get the Mod's attention, I don't think they read every post!  
---
Multiple reports of aiming issues creeping back into this patch, have it documented and reported.
---
I think one of the big issues is certain grenades. Throwing a frag straight down will end up miles away.
---
Didn't realize you also did fights! Just got into it myself. So far haven't made a dime, giving all the caps back to winners just been doing it for fun. I also don't compete myself or charge people to watch so feel free to come watch some time:)
---
Because the fundamental shift in gaming being shit today is due to consumers not caring.
---
Agrees with the already posted information. I’m on PS4 and use power armor full time on a Low health shotgun build. Goo, healing factor and diluted radaway are perfect combo
---
Scared to ask what it cost.
---
Sadly I'm on xb1
---
Gotcha, that’s what I thought
---
Bethesda's customer service has acknowledge the issue, and it will be fixed in the next patch, I guess I got lucky, don't know how... but I did
---
What the what!!! Yes!!!
---
Can't argue!
---
Is there a link to that?
---
That would be awesome
---
Thanks right back at you!
---
Lol damn, this post just screams out Bethesda's ineptitude, but I still can't stop playing. 🤷🏾‍♂️
---
Fantastic, thanks!
---
What progam / drawing pad did you use this looks amazing
---
Just frustrating to see people bringing up legitimate critisisms of this game get shut down and told "you are just on hate bandwagon". When they are trying to point out a serious flaw or bug in the game.
---
 Hell how many months did bethesda let duping go on for? Every other online game that has had a public dupe come out has patched the dupe within a couple days. They left duping in the game for over 3 months. Or the 25k cap limit ontop of not being able to see what all the effects on a legendary item are in trade window has basically completely killed any chance of any sort of economy in this game before it even came out :(
---
Life is cruel
---
Whilst I appreciate that, there is nothing faster than pressing R1 and your map being centered on where you want to be.
---
Bethesda already has problems releasing things in an unbroken state. If they tried to do that, I'd bet there's a be an exploit to get every atom shop item for free Lol
---
....not that I have a problem with that though, it'd be pretty nice
---
You can trade it on the trading subreddit for thousands of caps...
---
My first day plaything someone gave me a gun and 25 stimpacks.  I've really enjoyed passing that along.
---
Its the grind that sucks.
---
That's a good point, lol.
---
My bad, I was referring to Line in The Sand. That "player" used a deathclaw to take down the turret. No idea if the same can be done at StA. Question for ya:  Why? Do people actually want these events to last longer or expend more ammo? Genuinely curious.
---
How does 188 .308 sound for 188 .38 rounds
---
I’m at max caps. I want the gun for myself
---
Dude, PM ME
---
Hey
---
Thanks for the clarification!
---
Yeah it does.
---
Sometimes I lay in bed and think to myself......
---
I wonder if that bucket head ever did show up?
---
Yeah but the preview and purchase options are mapped to the same button. All it takes is a slight lag or too hard of a press when you try to preview and you end up buying something on accident.
---
Long post, i really like it, you are so right man.
---
I think there's two possibilities. If the turret draws aggro, it might never land for a melee player to actually hit the SB. He's just trying to pull aggro so he can force a landing. 
---
The second is he's trying to draw your ire to make you switch off pacifist mode so he can get some PvP. People do try to sabotage events so they can't be completed.
---
Xbox lets you load **in** the golf club? That hardly seems fair, everyone else loads outside of it.
---
Yep you need to complete some of the BoS quests and get  a  military ID. It's kind of annoying now that I think about it - that rifle would be really useful during the early levels. If you are on PC I could craft you one.
---
Thanks for the suggestion!
---
Reread your post and I apologize I misread it.
---
I've never played Skyrim personally, but I do see what you're referring to and agree something such as that would definitely come in handy.
---
Maxed in damage, nothing else matters to me. Always packing: handmade for general use, leveler for slow pace tapping, three shotguns for different situations and distances, primed gauss for scorched beasts, pistol for low level areas, laser rifle for demanding pvp, 1 or 2 melees if I like to go up and personal. http://imgur.com/a/zj7sAw7
---
Armorwice 4 x assasins sentinel and one cham/sent. http://imgur.com/a/sZzEFVu
---
Perk build is maxed shotgunner, rifleman, nerd rage, bloody mess and demolition.
---
I usually notice this when my internet goes slow, i’m not sure if it’s a bug of anything.
---
Ahahaha... Sucker. And you're proud of it.
---
Thanks but I am on PS4 my crappy computer doesnt meet minimum specs :(
---
I started collecting rifles today so I can break them down for the mods. It's annoying but it's better than nothing.
---
I was being a little imprecise with my language, sorry.  It loads me just outside the Golf Club, on the Golf Club grounds.  Not the Golf Club building.  :-)
---
Was his name SteveKnigh678 because I did that and it might have been you
---
Like, private message?
---
I did
---
Maybe the rocket launcher was the treat? Because they treated you reaaly good!
---
I thought being made "more consistent" meant that specific items would no longer spoil too quickly when fast traveling. Perhaps I misunderstood what they intended.
---
Lol we need to have a crossover fight night
---
Good though, but these weapons previously reported the correct damage, reflecting the second shot, so it's something new.
---
Thanks for posting!  
---
Will be on the Next "Weapons Roundup" I do...  
---
Trying to keep this one to new or reintroduced issues.
---
I have had a similar approach regarding my use of TSE and would also be interested to see what happens on an alternate.
---
Valid Point
---
Are you on PC? I will visit o/
---
I did the same thing lol I think I bought the face tattoo as well. I accidentally pressed X and BAM! i bought it, oh sh!t! Till this day I have no idea how to craft the tattoo in the game lol..
---
That is interesting, atleast there is a way to see a close to accurate DMG report.
---
Yup lets add more end game content without actually rewarding you for finishing such content, pay the price to start the event, ammo and stimpaks to survive it only to get 0 legendaries fun times.
---
Do you have any building plans I could grab from you later on? I need to relocate my base and don't have the caps to purchase stuff
---
Ok thanks
---
I run melee or shotgun, depending on my mood and/or what I'm doing. Since they're both based on STR perks I have STR maxed and can swap out as needed to go full 2H melee perks, full shotgun, or a hybrid if I'm doing something like a solo run in a silo that benefits from a bit of range to augment the melee damage.
---
Legacy issue from FO4 I think, would sometimes happen when transition cells or Fast Traveling...
---
What was the charisma of your build? As charisma effects event rewards.
---
Its honestly safer to take workshops in survival mode at this point. Daily claim a workshop tasks are a game of taking a workshop as quietly as possible and immediately server hopping to avoid being a 200 cap pinata walking around the map.
---
Seriously the idea of pulling pranks on other people’s camps like this is genius. A prank kit would be a HUGE seller in the shop. 
---
OMG. WE NEED THIS
---
I’ll tell all the creatures to leave you alone.
---
Wow! Lot's of work put in here! Great job Sir!  
---
It is kind of disheartening. I'm at level 165 and probably ran 500 events in that time. I have never found any rare apparel in the game. Doesn't look like I'm on track to find anything either, at least according to your data.
---
&gt; You're pointing to a small handful of uniques that drop from bosses, which do not represent 99.9% of the drops in Diablo. 
---
Except that is the same thing they are saying here, that the sheepsquatch event should give them gauranteed random 3 star legendary item for having to pay 2k to buy the board.
---
&gt;That's like saying Fallout 76 already features guaranteed drops because officers always drop Nuke Codes even though every other drop is RNG'd. 
---
Except I've killed the beeping officers plenty of times and got no code. So that isn't a guaranteed drop either.
---
&gt;For real guy. Go make an entire hellfire campaign run. Count the regular drops vs your few guaranteed drops.  
---
I used to years ago, it was one of the more popular ways of earning some income after getting burnt out of mephisto and baal runs.
---
&gt;The ratio is 1000's to 1. 
---
Like it would be wtih sheepsquatch having a random 3 star drop. Actually its more like 10,000 to 1 in fallout 76 as diablo 2 had far fewer enemies. You could kill the ubers for a for sure torch drop at around level 30ish with a decently equipped smiter, or you could do it around level 30ish with a necro summoner naked. You definitely not going to solo sheepsquatch at level 30.
---
&gt;Anni and Hats are the exception. Not the rule.
---
Proves your claim that d2 had NO guaranteed drops wrong.
---
&gt;I can happily link you to a plethora of resources that explain the drop system and why you're wrong for trying to use the exception to make your point.
---
I guarentee I know diablo 2 better than you do, you said over and over they offered no for sure drops, I proved that wrong. You tried to claim RUNES were part of the drop table for items (they are on their own drop rates as MF and GF don't effect them, the only way to increase rune drop chances is to do forge runs and countess runs as they both also have guarenteed rune drops every kill.
---
You also tried to claim runes and GEMS could have prefixs and suffixes. That is also wrong. Face it you don't know what you are talking about. 
---
You are acting like d2 having 4 different bosses with guaranteed drops would be different than a SINGLE MOB in the FO76 having guaranteed drops.
---
Also, I would appreciate it if you stop calling me "dude" and "guy" I am an adult woman with children.
---
Let us sell ammo and we'll care.
---
That's cool.  But I do like my desk figures.  Makes me feel more at home.
---
Sure, just add me and send me a message reminding me they’re free. I usually charge less than the item price, but don’t mind giving some for free.
---
I was expecting more suicider SM's, for one thing.
---
Ah right ok
---
Thanks but I don't think they will listen.
---
You could trade it for a AA explosive, or number of other guns that would be good for your build.
---
Before it was fixed in the last patch (6?) People had to fully remove Adrenal reaction at times to fix the glitch
---
No. I am on PS4.
---
Still available? I'll pay more
---
Definitely points 4 and 5. On that bloody kill squirrels/chickens I was server hopping like mad as one of my chars camp is at a critter spawn. The one time squirrels are there they all just died. Used to just be robots but now everything seems to be suffering from it. 
---
 The second weapon mostly seems to be when getting in or out of PA or if a weapon breaks it's back to the 'can't equip a broken weapon' message, which was claimed to be fixed.
---
As Always, thanks for the great notes...  
---
Documenting and reporting..
---
I know, right?!
---
I was going to say, that would be a huge complaint if I loaded with enemies on screen. It's bad enough it happens at CAMPs.
---
Just looking for the imoster ss outfit
---
Missing nothing at all, of the two of us you'll keep your sanity the longest : )
---
I would love a Bethesda AMA to ask what is there actual vision for legendary drops, because the system they have now is illogical. You get named weapons from events that pale in comparison to random drops, and your two end game bosses drop junk. Completely baffling logic.
---
I've had the issue with enemies dropping dead randomly, it's a real pain when you see a three star die of a brain aneurysm.
---
As far as the vault 76 issue goes are you inside the vault or outside of it? If you are outside it could be the liberators around there.
---
Those are both 72% extra at 20% hp, which is around what you'd expect from Adrenal Reaction + Nerd Rage. This suggests that Bloodied is doing literally nothing. Which is weird.
---
🤣🤣🤣 that tickled me! Stumped me for a while too!
---
Here let me tape this Don’t Eat Me note on your back. That should do the trick.
---
No you don’t need to see it first.
---
Also smear this mustard all over you. Creatures in the wasteland hate mustard.
---
Could you also deliver this tub of Potato salad to Fort Defiance?
---
Cos it’s the same as the preview button?
---
Definately got it..may have to rad away it and re apply it? But the weapons do get stronger the lower my health which suggests it is working.
---
You can already get non-PA builds near PA levels of damage resistance. You can also achieve close-to-or-higher carry weight.
---
And if the soon to release backpacks don't work with PA, then you'll definitely achieve a higher carry weight.
---
Not to mention the legendary effects.
---
At the moment PA is really only strong in nuke zones where the rad resist outshines normal armored builds.
---
WHOOPS, sorry, read it wrong
---
Yep. Exactly what I got
---
Yeah I can do that , but u got anymore 308 i have 2000 38 rounds , and 200 308 for the mg42 is nothing
---
I’m scared to preview items anymore lol
---
Hey, you and me both are reformed wow'rs. Faction grind is just one way to improve things and I get it, you no like. Lets hope BGS eyeballs the post, in which case do you have ideas to make it better, or are you just ok with extreme rarity?
---
I am using both of those...yes it's driving me crazy as to why..
---
So thats why they always come after me? My bbq sauce body wash.
---
Someone at Bethesda *cough cough Todd cough* was running the microwave when they implemented the last patch and it broke the mods. We're all hoping for a hotfix soon.
---
For shotgun shells it take 1 ultracite and 1 florescent flux more than regular shotgun shells and crafts twice as many at a time. Does increased damaged to scorched and scorched beast
---
Sorry man that is all the .308 i have i my old gun used it alot so i was always realy low on it
---
You so tasty!!! You don’t even know!!!
---
No i was messing with mine today looking at range and damage. It doesn't increase it.
---
3 hrs
---
I want my money back
---
You're right, haven't gotten hungry enough for self cannibalization.
---
Pictures? I don’t think that’s true... I haven’t seen any other credible reports of this. People have been repeating just Farm the event but 0 proof that they drop from the sheepsquatch event
---
Just stand in front of the Supermutant with a Supersledge and you’ll get it if you stand still and close your eyes.
---
4 started a couple of patches back. I suspect it's an attempt to improve server performance. They start culling enemies that aren't engaged.
---
Yep it does work really well..just slow now on the AP regen because I don't want to lose bloody mess or mutation cards so had to sacrifice the vats cards.
---
*Strong liked this*
---
Highly doubtful that Sony would do crossplay for a game like this. Theyve always been kinda cunts about it.
---
you’re welcome :)
---
Well how else would you get the other plans if you didn’t have any more of the Lying Lowe quest to do?
---
Luck is 10, Charisma 8. A-ha, you say! Well... luck has no bearing on drops despite the word "luck." Some have theorized CHA is the answer, but if that's true we'd have a ton of players rocking 20+ CHA. 
---
FWIW I actually did 300 runs before this with 1, 8 and 17 CHA. I'd expect to see - despite the small sample size - some notable variation between 1 and 17. Nope. Outfit drops:  1 CHA:  0, 8 CHA 1, 17 CHA 1. For the 1k run I had 8 CHA all the way, soon to be knocked down for AGI.
---
VATS is already highly modified from previous games. It’s much harder to use, substantially less accurate and easy to counter because it’s real time. All you have to do is break line of sight by moving in and out of cover or sneaking. It doesn’t provide some massive advantage.
---
You the man!

Whoopie cushions in chairs.. TP'ing houses... Soaping windows.. Toothpaste on door handles.. A Wendigo in the bedroom...

Kowalski: analysis
---
Just remember if you see a guy in real life with tear drops under his eye give him a wide berth , if you see 5-6 or more get the f--- away. 
---
the more you know
---
Wow 3 hrs? That is a little much when all people are doing is server hopping.
---
After the vendor update, exploring for bases is going to become much more commonplace. At least it will be for me. I've become determined to explore ever residence I come across, and say hi to the players if they come to investigate who's visiting. Haven't been shot at so far. :D
---
You seem personally invested in what I do with the guns I find. Why?
---
Tru dat. I'm quite frustrated with how people behave during the event, period. I find myself activating a pylon, kiting the squatch, AND killing it each time. Maybe I'm just disillusioned to how much stronger an unyielding bloodied build really is as compared to the squishy rabble. Most people either sit on the shack or hide in the treeline, never even attempting to activate the pilon right next to them. I can kill the beast in about ten hits after he heals, but it's extremely difficult to tank pilon damage and squatch shots at the same time. I wish people could just focus on the pilons and let me kill the fool.
---
Sadly, however, I am a murder addict and I try to fight everyone there after the battle. It really is fun when you have seven dudes gunning for you as you're soaking your ratty skirt with the blood of the same fools who didn't bother to fully participate. The "My Dad Needs A Job" sign really seems to piss people off when you whack them a few times.
---
Exactly, no one knows. The side quests give you the wolf, yao guai, owlet, and rad stag mounted heads and the picnic blanket. They aren’t repeatable yet there are like 40 more mounted heads to preview. It’s a mystery to everyone so far, I’m just dispelling misinformation
---
I’m pretty much never going to buy that recall card, I’ll wait for more wealthy players lol
---
So you reckon having max lone wanderer isn't worth it?  Im also running with lvl 3 block which admittedly if im playing the long shot game i guess i could drop
---
This is def something we need since you lose all your buffs for your underarmor and regular armors.
---
A ha, thank you. So that guy at Line wasn't a jerk after all, I was just ignorant. He being melee and all, yeah. I get it now.
---
I’d be surprised if there isn’t already a Mothman plushie considering it’s a real urban legend and the real Point Pleasant is all about Mothman
---
This. If PA had all the same perks as regular armor no one wear anything but PA. 
---
I like the idea of small buffs or even just more variety of mods you can install.
---
\-Longer jet pack duration
---
\-Deep pocketed
---
\-Higher jump
---
\-Increased disease resistance
---
\-Faster running
---
\-Improved durability
---
The Bethesda model is just a giant moth with different colored eyes. It’s not really unique
---
You can get some from Encryptid &amp; some from the Hunting event.
---
Everyone knows the super popular spots: whitesprings, top of the world, Watoga. But if you have to go to relay tower ABC-123 it takes too much time looking for the correct area. I think we will learn the map with time but it helps all the more than alt + tabbing out of the game to open fo76maps
---
It can happen there for sure.  If people are out in the lot fighting off ghouls, you can load right into there and get your ass handed to you by invisible things.
---
This kinda happened to me. My game would crash because it was looking for a monitor that did not exist. I tried to mess around with the ini file to change the value of which monitor to use, but was too afraid to mess with anything. 
---
I ended up using the Nvidia GeForce experience thingy to change monitors instead.
---
 To say that it isn't pay to win.... 
---
seems to me our definitions of pay to win are different.  I truly love playing the game, and I want the experience to continue. If we stop saying that it's important,  Bethesda will ignore it and continue to implement features such as this.  So if you have it in you to ignore this trans gression enjoy, but if we are able somehow to get them to re-think this;  we could change the  longevity of the game and it's moneymaking potential drastically –  for the better.
---
Which ones have you seen from those events?
---
It's really fun. It's definitely been the year of hate as far as video games go. A lot of great games have been swept under the rug, for no reason, thanks to a bunch of cry babies. Playing by myself I got 30 fun hours out of it and another 70 with friends. Well worth any pricetag that falls on fo76.
---
ME
---
Pasted from above,  FWIW I actually did 300 runs before this with 1, 8 and 17 CHA. I'd  expect to see - despite the small sample size - some notable variation  between 1 and 17. Nope. Outfit drops:  1 CHA:  0, 8 CHA 1, 17 CHA 1. For  the 1k run I had 8 CHA all the way, soon to be knocked down for AGI.
---
As far as I know, no one has gotten one yet. I don't know the method either.
---
With that build you'd probably want to put more into damage mitigation like Dodgy and Serendipity than DR. I just didn't want to stray to far from your original build.
---
I’ve never gotten an event one personally because I’ve been busy all week but getting them from the hunting event should be pretty obvious seeing as how mounted heads are hunting trophies usually.
---
No. Crouching -does- decrease your speed, but doesn't use AP outside of stealthboy modded power armor. 
---
This is entirely irrelevant to the subject however, i.e. Equipping Fixer increases your crouched movement speed. u/batuckan1 please read things fully before replying.
---
I'm okay with extreme rarity for *some* items, with some caveats:
---
* RNG Rarity: Should be employed very, very sparingly, and there should be measures in place to mitigate RNG (**duplicate protection** so you don't get plans/recipes you already know, for example, **pity timers** so after X failed rolls your likelihood to get something good gradually improves, etc.). Ideal candidates for RNG rarity are cosmetics and vanity items.  
---
* Skill-Gated Rarity: Can be hugely rewarding, but needs to be handled with immense care. Questionable examples include Destiny 2's competitive crucible pinnacle rewards (Luna's Howl, Not Forgotten, Redrix's, etc) where you're forcing players into a super sweaty and frustrating play mode. Good examples include OG Destiny's First Curse quest line where you *had* to master this weapon archetype to prove you're worthy of the end reward.  
---
* RNG Rarity fused with Skill-Gated Rarity: Killing an endgame boss and hoping they drop a piece of loot you want, i.e. SBQ. This needs to stop. It's 2019. We should be better than that. Just have endgame bosses consistently drop tokens and let players choose which rewards they want to get.
---
I'm hyper curious about how the Legendary vendor will work (*SIDE NOTE: if BGS doesn't name this vendor Hans Moleman, we riot*), because it looks a lot like it'll be some sort of reforging mechanic like in some other games.
---
Pretty sure it's not a machine issue, I'm not the only one in my group that gets booted for server crashes, that happened twice yesterday.  I run with a pretty big group, theres usually anywhere between 3-10 of us on at any one time.  Everyone else has had similar issues.  I appreciate your input, I just think there is more work to do with regards to server stability and bugs.  That being said, I think we can both agree that it is a RAD game that has, and continues to get better.
---
I think the idea behind the more ridiculous challenges is that people weren't buying Atoms.
---
Instead they were earning them which means Bethesda wasn't making extra money.
---
I just run through with an axe.  Not hard at all. I just get Fucking lost in there every single time. Lvl 93 with the worst build ever.
---
Hi, thank you. I'd say don't focus on events unless you have the mental capacity of a mollusk (like me) and are thus able to avoid frustration. Seems like the best approach is to do these "normally", that is, in between other things.
---
There you go, form your own opinions. If you want to try a game, try it. Play it. Form your own opinion. If you play it and you don’t like it, then you get to have that opinion. It’s an informed opinion based on your own feelings about something. If you don’t want to buy the game on a chance you might like it, play it at a friends house or try to demo it somehow. Or maybe get it on sale if you can. That way you don’t lose much if anything and you can form your own idea about something
---
If you have an explosive shotgun at level 12 or whatever low level you do it at, I fucking envy you.
---
Are these Quad or standard? (Sorry melee build so don't know the numbers off hand)
---
Some awesome players out there. Had one person give me a bunch of plans and crafting mats and another offer me a PA chassis. I didn't take the chassis because I don't need more than one atm.
---
I like to try pay it forward by leaving plans meds and food in containers like the overseer caches.
---
I haven’t played in awhile, did they fix the horrendous nerfs they implemented awhile ago? I quit because they completely fucked 2 shot and explosive legendary effects, nerfed exp gain, and nerfed perk cards that make repairing easier. Is any of that stuff remedied yet?
---
Not sure what you are asking exactly. Are you wondering who uses vats? I have a vats pistol build. I stack tons of bonuses with it to actually make the weapon type viable. I find it fun. And with the nerfs nobody else noticed, it is pretty balanced. The obvious counters to vats are invisibility and crouching. Every play style needs a counter. Vats counters the TSE sentinel/assassin's fairly well. Could be better if they reverted one shot protection though.
---
No, I’m complaining about the lack of viability certain builds and an entire weapon type have in PvP. If I want to enjoy PvP I have to play the game a certain way and can’t use a build I enjoy in a franchise that’s supposed to be all about player choice and having fun with whatever you want. Heavy weapons and power armor should be viable in PvP. All the other combat stuff is but these two aren’t. If I want to participate in workshops, hunting down bounties, or whatever in a PvP scenario I can’t unless I grind and respec to something I don’t find as fun. I want to play PvP but I’m forced to do it a certain way when it should be my choice. That isn’t fair especially since heavy weapons and power armor don’t offer much if anything in the way of a real advantage over the other weapon types and builds in PvE. Outside of RAD protection anyway. So you get a negligible PvE benefit and negative PvP performance when the others get to be great at both. 
---
I want equal viability in both PvE and PvP for *all weapons types and combat builds*. That’s how it should be. There’s no point in having build customization if there’s going to be clearly shitty things there’s no point in using. My issue isn’t that I got ganked by some dickhead. It’s that I got ganked by some dickhead and had no chance to fight back because one playstyle, the one I happen to enjoy, has the only combat build that isn’t viable at killing players. I leveled up and did all the content in the game just to get fucked over by terrible balancing.
---
I can’t equip fireproof and other fancy schmancy defensive perks to help against TSE’s and everything because I need every perk I can get just to make heavy weapons PA *usable* let alone decent. Even after the buffs this build sucks.
---
Note you will burn through ammo so fast. Always claim the munition factory.
---
4k on PC. Which is pretty close to the actual cap gains during this run:  5643.
---
A mothman and whatever the purple alien name is when you get to fight them should be legendary sometimes, and have them drop better items.
---
I am level 30 right now, got charged 24 Caps for my placements but one time 31 with no visible reason. It was not the last time I moved the camp.
---
Oh fuck. I saw this, and did a sort of laugh screech. Help me
---
Buddy I’m a heavy Guns PA build it is viable you suck
---
oh m god yes!! throwable deathclaw, mirelurker, stingwing, chicken, and rad scorpion eggs with a SPLAT effect on homes and surfaces.
---
* cleans off with one *varied* water *
---
..drugged candy too?
---
asking for a friend ..
---
I don't I just was trying to be helpful and let you know that a junkies prefix with 2 other good suffixes is worth A LOT and not a "garbage" gun. Would be silly to see someone waste a gun that they could easily trade it for the exact gun you want.
---
Yeah in real life, that is how you would get more mounted heads, but this is Fallout 76 with specific loot pools. No one so far has reported having any mounts other than wolf, yao guai, owlet, and rad stag, and they come from the side quests on the wall in Calvin’s office. I’ve gotten them all. Thought it was random til I checked with a lot of people that they indeed got the exact same drops. So for now, it’s definitely not clear how to get the others.
---
I wouldn't recommend a level twelve entering that cave
---
Jesus Christ Chris
---
It’s okay at PvE and easy to use against AI that’s why people use it. PA is absolute trash in PvP so legendary effects that could help there would be greatly desired by many of us.
---
Still a great leveling spot after the mayor quest is completed at least.
---
I want a Plushie Sheepsquatch
---
SHHHHHHHH
---
No one wants the kids from Twilight
---
That's when I did it...
---
FOTM? KOTH? CTF? FFA?
---
I don't mean to sound ignorant but...what are these supposed to mean??
---
I'm playing in survival mode and starting to see whY events are structured they way they are! They are cheap to travel to and bring you to different locations besides train stations! Also they reward you good supplies lol In adventure mode without dropping gear things are so abundant you don't need  events unless you want rare clothing! I'm guessing they have lower drop rates because they expected more people to be doing them! The only events that ever have more than 3 people are the queen fashnact and sheep squatch!
---
Same here. It’s the biggest mystery in 76 that I’m trying to stay on top of. Zero reports so far on any mounted heads other than wolf, yao guai, owlet, and rad stag
---
Yeah the duping was really frustrating and I stopped playing for a bit because of that at the time.
---
*Sure* you are. You couldn’t possibly be saying that because you don’t want to lose the argument and have no actual counter-points to what I said. Make like a tree and get be fuck outta here.
---
I posted this in several similar threads. The cap loss should be double your level until you reach level 76 (just because. lol). The maximum amount lost would be 152 caps.
---
**For example:**
---
\-level 5 player gets killed. Costs him 10 caps.
---
\-level 25 player gets killed. Costs him 50 caps.
---
\-level 60 player gets killed. Costs him 120 caps.
---
\-level 76 player gets killed. Costs him 152 caps.
---
\-level 325 player gets killed. Costs him 152 caps.
---
Once you get to level 70 or so you should have a good idea on what build you are going with. You should have some decent weapons and armor. Fundamentally a level 325 player isn't really more powerful than a level 76 player. Sure he probably has had more time to find better weapons and armor but in reality they are on a similar power level.
---
A level 5 player doesn't get completely devastated by being killed with this system. Honestly it would hardly be worth the trouble to go after them after you factor in 
---
A level 325 player doesn't lose 650 caps because someone spotted him across the map and got a lucky shot in.
---
People that still want to hunt players will make a decent amount. Especially if they go after higher level guys. Earning 152 caps in 3 seconds is still a pretty good profit! Lol
---
If you kill someone two times within a set time (10 mins?) , then the  player who was killed can put a 100 cap bounty on the offender. The offender pays 50 caps and the  person putting the bounty pays 50 caps, this cap amount is collected upon death. Bounties cannot be collected by anyone you have been teamed up with in the last 4 hours.
---
If you have zero caps you do 90 pct less damage in pvp. Basically you have to avoid people and earn back some money.
---
?😂
---
Eh, it's better than doing nothing.
---
And you have another assaultron recall key? You’ll need one each time you want to initiate the fight
---
Your inability to respect and not willing to grant is your fault,  I want to respect your power armor build a make it what it needs to be for PVP and you’re angry that it’s not good just to be good,  respond to any of your points you made because there’s no counter to bullshit. Big guns and power armor are viable you just need to adapt or keep dying
---
There should be a button on your keyboard to switch it from two screen to one, it looks like a box on top of a box. Try a Google search?
---
Yeah i have one. Got the free one from the mission i never got to use because becauseits always in the waiting period.
---
That's not extortion lmao
---
The cake is a lie
---
Fact that you started using vulgarity in the last aspect of your replies  means I struck a nerve
---
You can spin it however you like. Doesn't change the truth.
---
Thanks, Just Photoshop!
---
Bare spoiler: Related to a quest
---
Aw, I have the deathclaw and PA statues facing each other on a table, like a stand-off
---
Guess this one wins
---
Very interesting as I've got conflicting data from Fasnacht.
---
I ran about 30-40 Fasnacht's on my main and he has a base of 10 charisma and I usually had it buffed to 12 per run. I only managed 3 berets on him.
---
But I made a new character during Fasnacht dedicated solely towards running Fasnacht and testing theories. I also leveled him solely with Fasnacht runs, including killing mobs when possible since a lot of folks didn't give many chances to do such and I got around 100 runs or so on this toon, probably more as I stopped counting after a while. So I maxed his charisma and luck. Between 1-10 charisma I got about 3 berets. At 11+ charisma, I was getting berets on an average of 1:5 runs. So charisma definitely makes an impact.
---
I maxed charisma before luck, so I can safely say that lucky doesn't effect event rewards.
---
 I'm not lying.  I'm not a troll.  And Reddit is almost the worst place to try and post ideas that are "outside the box".  
---
There are always people ready and waiting to downvote/attack anything they don't understand yet - *most* significant new ideas face this, people calling them "crazy" or "stupid".
---
I was at and Apple show back when they were still selling the last and final model of Apple II and I spoke to Richard Garriot (AKA Lord British) who told me that they were indeed working on Ultimate Online.  I didn't feel so bad at how slow my game development was going when I heard how much trouble *they* were having - I imagine he had a team of 50 people working on his project.
---
"Failing at life" - hmm, I suppose you have some right to feel insulted, and thus respond by trying to be mean, but, when I hear things like a mom, in front of her own child, saying things like: "I wish I had children like yours", well, I must be doing *something* right 🤣😋
---
I get comments like "you should have more kids" often - so, even if I've somehow failed, *the future looks bright.*
---
vault tech had the G.E.C.K. or garden of eden creation kit it has the ability to terraform irradiated soil and bring life to the wastelands.
---
Oh I was dangered before I fast travelled to vault 76, which if I was actually dangered shouldn't have worked.
---
My friend and I have completed dozens and dozens of events every day for the past month trying to get outfits. We haven't seen anything drop until the other night, I was looking through his inventory while we trading stuff to our alts and I saw he had the jumpsuits for Whitespring, Whitepowder, (possibly BoS but don't remember) and two types of Western outfits I believe. He doesn't know when it dropped though (he literally hoards everything in his Excavator). I read that you get a bunch of the outfits when one drops so it might have just been one event.
---
Combined we probably have over 2000 hours; my characters at Lvl250/Lvl90 and his at Lvl190/Lvl55. And only one copy of the apparel. But at least it gives us something to do ...
---
I actually love this idea
---
Maybe English isn’t your primary language but I can’t understand whatever you’re trying to say. “I want to respect your power armor build a make it what it needs to be for PVP and you’re angry that it’s not good just to be good, respond to any of your points”?
---
Seriously, what? I’m not even going to bother anymore.
---
Removing vats makes the sentinel/assassin's armor set much more difficult to deal with. In fact, it leaves certain weapons, like pistols, without any way to kill sentinel users.
---
There are three ways to combat sentinel armor: staggers, radiation damage, and critical hits. Removing vats removes one of those counters.
---
Pistols do not have any perk cards for stagger chance. No vats means no criticals. No criticals means pistols are worthless. Sentinel armor becomes completely imbalanced.
---
... A standard mod that increased its star rating?
---
Or a new form of legendary mod?
---
Daaamn I reported this already a few times in bethesda forum. Hope they'll fix it soon. 
---
I'm tired of finding a neat armor piece to find out its bugged :(
---
Thanks for confirming!
---
Yep :)
---
Xoxo
---
Jesus Christ indeed, why does there always have to be some asshole downvoting me 😥
---
Tedium is the base of the game, if it was not there the game would collapse in on its self. I say that because you can do all missions all side missions and attend all events at least just once and be at end game by level 35. All that's left to do is drop a nuke, you've reached the end of the story line, so what's left to do is constantly search for resources to do the menial tasks in the game. So all your doing after level 35 is repairing armor and weapons after attending events, events that are the only thing left in the game, over and over and over again, boredom induced.
---
Eh, so I wouldn’t have trusted a source based on a video from before the game was out. I’ll grant you that even the ingame help doesn’t mention XP gain, but it absolutely does increase it. If I run around Watoga shooting level 50 bots in my Unyielding gear with 25 intelligence, I get 121xp a kill. Take off the unyielding gear for 10 int, I get 90 a kill. 
---
It also says higher int increases scrapping gains. Yeah, that’s technically true, but practically speaking it isn’t. 25 int, with scrapper perk, level 45 minigun scraps for 26 steel. 10int scrapper perk, scraps for 25 steel. Without scrapper there’s no difference.
---
oh man imagine the smell a sperm bank that has had its power shut off for over 20 years 🤮

Whoops, my bad. FOTM:  Flavor of The Month. KOTH:  King of The Hill. CTF:  Capture the Flag. FFA:  Free For All.

Ahh thank you, koth i thought was king of the hill but i just couldn't figure out the rest, thanks!
---
When some big dumb creepy guy says to you (another adult) "comere I got a treat for you" it * usually* has something to do with his genitals.
---
I am not wrong.
---
...
---
Oh people are still creating mods for FO4??
---
Yeah i dont have any real complaints, and every week seems things get better.
---
yeah but you would have to download everyones pictures when you load adding to load times and In csgo and tf2 it saves all sprays including the porn ones meaning if you play for a long enough time you passively create a folder dull of images and porn
---
Don't swerve then. 
---
I think you're missing the point. If you just read reviews you aren't getting the full picture and just spewing off all the bad stuff while completely ignoring all of the good. 
---
Like the Jeep. You're basically saying they're bad because if you suddenly swerve going at high speeds it might roll, well no shit, it's an SUV with a lot of ground clearance, and the ground clearance is there for good reason. It's fantastic off-road and probably one of the most fun vehicles you can have as a daily on the road, just don't go do any deer slaloms that only exist in tests and you're golden. But you wouldn't know that because you're not only automatically writing something off because of a review, you're going around saying it's bad because of what you heard in a review. You don't have to buy it, just keep you're mouth shut and let other people enjoy what they like. 
---
This isn't really directed at you, just basically what happened with Fallout 76.
---
If you head down near the bottom of the Mire near the giant stone plateau place there will be a bunker south from it and there will be a giant swamp. You could try there
---
yeah but i think nude mods for this game are a thing so lewd images still gonna slip in
---
There are two mods that are special and add a star to their weapons.  
---
Scorched killer receiver and the cultist blade.
---
excelsior home and dolly sods
---
Indeed
---
No worries dude. Pick up Skyrim! It is a classic, however you may feel about its ranking in the series.
---
Please stop complaining about 2 shot explosives. I went toe to toe with an equally leveled player with a explosive shot gun and he had a handmade TSE. I got my ass handed to me and guess what...? After a 4 or 5 deaths I left the server, admitted defeat and went about my business. So it IS unfair to ask to remove them because you got an ass kicking. And he couldn’t have just dropped you without being wanted, initiating a fight  or owning a workshop.
---
It OP especially with 33+ luck=infinite crits with vats on a automatic weapons.
---
But I can bring myself to get rid of unique weapons and the bunker buster takes up 45 pounds!
---
Personally it's because the mechanics. When you take a workshop your prompted that is pvp in zone. If it was only in those periods then cool, whatever.  Problem is that it stretches outside the zone and does not end if they take the workshop, even if you didnt contest.  At least I was a free kill when I popped in later for a defense event.
---
Personally adventure should prompt both parties when challenge happens and only then enable pvp for everyone.
---
thats not a temp folder they accumulate all those pictures in a folder including the lewd and messed up ones
---
Makes me wanna buy it now, thanks! Long time lurker
---
Thank ya! I had never found that place before and now I have :) got my challenge done and then two scorchbeasts didn't like me killing their friend 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
For the next run?
---
I love 76, but ARE YOU MAD?
---
Tried server hopping?
---
I'm so sad, if I want lots of upvotes, I have to post something that's not too clever, or "outside the box".
---
I thought this was dumb enough to be a big hit with Redditors...
---
I've seen #4 happen more frequently. I've been noticing the sleep glitch especially at WS that the ghouls are fast asleep lol I'm like walking over to them "Get up!" some don't even wake up and I kill them..
---
good catch. ty!
---
True about every build has a counter and I really hate how some people think your hacking and that theres no way to counter vats.
---
Am now
---
Did it too. There was still a pile of bones left. After picking it up it worked.
---
Thanks to the original commenters. They helped me too ;)
---
Nice
---
Yep, unless I see something that I like in the shop I won’t waste my time unless it’s super easy to do. When something comes around I’ll probably have enough time or atoms saved up to buy it
---
Wendigo, SB, and Mothman look so cool too.
---
Man if you want a weapon just say so
---
Rad dad.
---
Dude (may I call you dude?)... this is great. These are all good and this one intrigues me:   *Good examples include OG Destiny's First Curse quest line where you had to master this weapon archetype to prove you're worthy of the end reward.*  Never played Destiny but it sounds good to me.
---
You can change your appearance at any time in the ESC menu
---
I have a max level vampires with 40% swing speed.  If interested shoot me an offer.
---
Your argument is “I left because his TSE was better than my TSE, stop complaining”? Wow, brilliant. You’ve totally changed my opinion on how balanced these things are.
---
Damn..... guess someone had to ruin it.
---
Head north of Abbie's Bunker until you come across a river. Follow that river upstream and you will reach a large pond. This pond is a pretty consistent spot for at least three Anglers to spawn at.
---
Indeed!  They have really turned it around.
---
the truth is out there! this professor on the holotape told something about every animal has its mating rituals.
---
so maybe we must find out how this ritual works and then find the right place, maybe even in the right time. maybe its just the love emote maybe its more. but i just have the feeling that the imposter event leads us to a bigger worldboss.
---
going to read and hear all the notices and tapes again. oh and i think it has something to do with these new quests, too. where you hunt animals (you get a trophy for camp as reward).
---
Heck yeah I'll help him out! I'll make him a full set of level 25 power armor too!
---
Lol same 😆
---
Gamertag: Topher Fury 
---
Be on this evening
---
You are correct sir
---
Yeah, not at all what I had in mind.  Also, I dont have an alternate account.  People take GAMES too seriously, and thats why other cant enjoy it in the way they might have.
---
Were you on PS4 by any chance? Because I was JUST outside of Flatwoods during a 2-minute long radstorm earlier today...
---
I will add it tonight, thanks! hopefully I can deselect it if I don't like it lol
---
If you can't trust a Supermutant, who can you trust?
---
He needs to grind white springs with a higher level to levels. Once he hits 25 it gets easier.  Sorry I can't help, I'm a mom who likes playing with kiddos.  I'm on ps4.
---
Interesting, for sure. Ultimately we don't know unless we convince ourselves that x runs at x CHA value = output. Not saying your findings are invalid by any means, its just there are other possibilities aside from strict RNG or CHA, such as account or character seeding.
---
Thought Fluffy is pinned to a rock by crossbow bolts??? Is there a second Fluffy?
---
I'm on PC. Flatwoods was a ghost town.
---
Great joke but for real those 3star legendary muties better give me something sweet next time in the firm of my very own level 50 3star weapon anddddorrr armor piece!
---
Then you have the quantum grenade that can land at someone's feet and not hit them because they are too far away. OR grenades get blocked by terrain because they don't pass through walls.
---
Does it drop molotovs, because they are the only grenade that might be of use, detonates on contact, hits through walls, sets the area on fire, not completely trash aoe.
---
Although some people were probably baked..
---
Good idea. I also think you should only be able to contest a workshop once every 30 minutes. Even if you successfully defend the same players and teams can continually battle you.
---
I think my primary concern is that with it being so centralized on killing (kill leaderboard)  it'll just magnetize the tryhards with their duplicated god tier loadouts.  And impossible to find weapons.  I, to my surprise, enjoyed survival mode initially.  Usually, I'd just avoid players seeing how long I could survive.  Sometimes I'd run into them, and they'd be friendly.  Sometimes not.
---
What about a melee that has bonus energy damage like an AA flaming pitchfork.
---
How is your personal anecdote supposed to change my mind? You mention nothing of the engagement distance, what kind of armor either of you had, or anything else of the sort. If he’s sitting out of the range of a shotgun and has good armor and a VATS crit build then him killing you doesn’t mean anything. You pretty much picked the only scenario where a two shot explosive weapon would realistically lose. If you had an explosive rifle instead of a shotgun and he had his regular shitty handmade the results would have undoubtedly been reversed.
---
It won't tell you but to make another you have to buy one from a vendor and then use a tinkerers workbench to make the proper one. It also takes a stable flux. I buy mine for 1800 caps so I can recover the value once a day. Make sure you drain the current 1400 caps from the vendor then sell it and take the remaining.
---
Huh, never used either of those mods... :-/
---
Guess I should have...
---
In a way, yes.  In a way, no.  I liked the idea of trying to survive better than trying to kill.
---
Nah i found him alive. I do know also though people have found the dog from the other quest alive and he was dead for me.
---
How do you pick it up
---
I wish there was a way I could play on two xboxs with the same account so I could help him myself
---
And just like in the real world, it's not even Halloween and there are Christmas decorations up...
---
Noo ahaha so if a kid runs out you're not swerving? I'm saying it as a recent analogy it doesn't represent this situation entirely.  Forget the jeep let's just say any vehicle in general. If a game has known framerate problems (roll over risk) or floating enemies (bad transmission), getting kicked off servers and not being able to get back (burns oil and needs gasket replacement) you would avoid that type of vehicle at all costs not buy it just to see how it is. Same with any other type of purchase that has extremely bad reviews upon launch (76 did improve a lot). 
---
The gaming industry is starting to catch on to lies and microtransactions, look at 76, bf5, anthem. People are staying away because of legitimate problems with the game. They discounted it right away.. They knew there was problems and planned for low sales numbers from the beginning. 
---
The fallout series is my favourite series as is elder scrolls. I'm not bashing it I'm saying there's a reason fans had constant outrage from before even release day concerning this game and alot of it wasn't blown out of proportion. I played from day one and had several game breaking issues and had to wait months for a fix so I'm glad I cancelled my preorder and my buddy game shared it with me. 
---
You can't expect someone to ignore bad reviews and gameplay proof 76 had major issues from the beginning. You're faulting them for making an informed buying decision instead of going blindly into a $90-$120 game that was discounted shortly thereafter.
---
I play PC, I'm PST time if you need a hand let me know my game name is same as Reddit.
---
Sounds like this guys just looking for an argument. Get better at the game.  What more can I tell you. The idea of removing items people use and enjoy because you got your ass kicked is down right laughable. Maybe try something more your speed.
---
I like to think that the christmas tree in the river outside Point Pleasant is someone who got really fed-up with that and threw their neighbor's tree into the water.
---
And the Christmas decorations at Whitesprings
---
I’ll try your mom she’s pretty fast.
---
If Bethesda wanted to be world-class trolls they'd put christmas music on the radio starting in July.
---
Don’t forget Nuka Girl!
---
Dick Shale. Dead Dick Shale.
---
I accidentally bought the 1800 atom usa power armor skin lol never gonna use it!
---
I’ve read that it’s possibly tied to items in the landscape (trees, bushes, buildings, skeletons) I keep my camp on the green with a completely clear build zone, I’ve been able to build massive buildings, but my friend is in the forest and doesn’t have the space to build something that big. Both past 50, I thought it did increase through levels, but I’m not sure now. I don’t think there’s anything solid on it.
---
I play with subtitles on and I often see:
---
"Super Mutant: 'stupid noises'"
---
I always interpret it as:
---
"Super Mutant: *stupid noises*
---
I discovered this too :(
---
Last senrence - But once you get two caps you are good to fight? Then I'm okay with what you wrote.
---
It’s a random encounter you’ll find the corpse of a cub lol war reanactor who could have it on him but the top hats been merged so it didn’t sell great to vendors and costs more mats
---
Damn fluffy used to be a source of food for me, now I have people walking in my back yard
---
I really hate how people suggest removing vats without thinking about the implications. Entire builds, mutations, perks and food rendered completely worthless. Pistols, whose main strength is low AP costs, would be completely powerless to sentinel armor. Pistols get no staggers, so they need criticals. It is silly the things people come up with.
---
Please consider going back to the old system for repairing stuff. This new one – even if you do manage to fix the display bar – is too convoluted considering how often one must repair things.
---
It's a random drop on a random spawn. If you server hop in The Mire, near the dam whose name I forget, by the 65 road sign on your map, you have a chance. It'll take a lot of time, if you're unlucky but it should happen eventually.
---
Quantum grenades have a bugged AoE. They’re the most useless throwable in the game. The blast radius you see is not it’s actual blast radius
---
Sorry, the spawn you're looking for is called the Civil War Reenactor.
---
Good stuff.
---
To the right of wavy williards, there's the pvp civil war event.  Is that what you're thinking??
---
Noticed that it doesn't drop flares, not sure about Molotovs.
---
Do you just want the rifle? Surely there's someone around that will craft you one.
---
Make sure he’s in the right areas for his level. 
---
Different parts of the map have different 
---
level enemies, and that can play a part in difficulty.
---
My pleasure. If one person asks it means others saw it and thought ????. You done a service, thank you.
---
I don’t think that the overseers mission is actually the main quest , however I think it’s glitched currently , because I’ve collected all the holotapes and still have the quest active 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
what's the board for ?
---
Maybe you have to earn back your total amount you could potentially lose. Say you are level 50 you have to earn back 100 caps before you can get full damage while attacking.
---
Gt chefdaddy911 PM me if he still.needs something. I hook u up
---
Yeah I just want the rifle, was hoping to get it myself without having to ask around for someone to craft it.
---
Could also be because they're planning to add more tapes in the future.
---
I may have committed a mistake, but I still don't understand how VATS is good against S/A Armor, can you explain me to clarify it, please? :)
---
Oh okay, well I’m glad it’s not only me then 👍
---
Try launching the game from a different user account on your PC. Or create a new user and try to launch the game from that account.
---
Sweet, whenever you get the chance add me and I'll join your server whenever I see you on. [: PSN: BootlegVibes
---
Haha. Then again, Game o' Thrones starts up Sunday. That'll cut down on events a little bit; GF takes the pre-show dinner prep seriously.
---
Really? Awesome wtg bethesda because this isnt a pain in the a** enough just to find a server to start it, gotta even make it? That's just amazing.
---
Coming in May
---
Yup.  Thanks for proving my point. Nothing says I won an argument like the old “your mom joke” as a rebuttal. I’m done with this little kid. Peace.
---
When you're cooking higher tier food, since separate food buffs stack, it makes sense to have them not last for hours. Most food buffs last from 30-60 minutes after you eat them, you don't need to be hungry to eat the foods for buffs. The trade off is you can't walk around with them for more than a few hours.
---
So the options are non-buff food that never spoils or good buffs from food that will become fertilizer if you don't use them. I think that's balanced half decent.
---
Upvote - Easy enough patch Bethesda?
---
I posted about this yesterday because my camp is near there too. I've seen him about 7 times so far but he doesn't drop anything good.
---
Any info on what it will entail? I’ve just heard mostly vending machine but one news site said something about a more Immersive set up. Really hoping for the latter
---
I think the wholes 50s thibf percludes plastic bottles.
---
Spoons aliens and all that other junk tho
---
Do you have a low intelligence
---
They said they’re gonna keep the cost low for the basic one. And I’m not your dude, pal
---
&gt;Civil War Reenactor.
---
And is there any costume that i can craft with cheap components and sell it good?
---
 Nuke zones I agree, but for PvP when you can crank your str up to nearly double, or damage resistance to an outrageously high amount... 
---
How is that the appropriate balance ?
---
And I believe the PA should have a higher resistance  thank non PA and there should be an advantage (not OP) personally
---
If 1 keeps happening, just server hop. It happens randomly. It seems all the enemies' perception is cranked way up so they detect everything from a mile away, keeping you in caution or danger. They keep 'fixing' it but it still happens from time to time.
---
There desperately needs to be someone outside of the dev enclave that can log in and just check a few things to make sure it’s not completely bonkers. I noticed the friendslist bug as soon as servers came up. The fact this was pushed out regardless tells me they have nobody double checking the work besides the player base or they recognized the issue and decided to push ahead anyways. 
---
And further, this subreddit needs to be a bit more judicious in how they evaluate things. Sure, it was great that VATS no longer targets friendlies, but it seems like people overlooked the bad in favor of the good. But the first few days following the patch all you saw as top posts were the fixes and not the failures. Somebody play test this shit already
---
True I personally don't run a vats pistol build but my friend does and from what he told me and what I've seen it's a very reliable build. Vats also cant be removed because it will be lore breaking in a big way and vats impacts so many build all the way to melee builds.
---
I couldn’t have said it better myself.
---
PA in PVP is unbalanced to an extreme.
---
I believe it works on everything
---
I may have seen you if you're on ps4.
---
To spawn the event
---
ahh never knew that one more question sorry where do you get it from ?
---
my joystick sometimes does a double tap of the "A" and that's how i bought a pajama while trying to preview the item lol
---
luckily i sent a ticket and they refund me the atoms
---
I have a way too. Shoot them in the face.
---
Your comments don’t deserve anything more than derision. You come in with some story vacant of any actual details while saying TSE’s are fine. Of course you’d want to do that since you know they aren’t fine and you’re a TSE user. 
---
If TSE’s were fair and balanced there wouldn’t be a TSE handmade with +ADS move speed selling for 17k credits in one of the marketplaces right now. These weapons go for more than any other single item in the game because they’re broken, you vapid kumquat. They got duped to hell and back because everyone knew how good they are, not because they’re balanced. You want a respectful conversation then don’t be an obvious shill like every other moron that came in here saying nothing but “TSE’s fine stop crying” because you don’t want your shit rightfully nerfed.
---
I’m on Xbox, that spot is quite popular too nice and central for jumping to vendors and farming areas
---
Lol says the dood that said dude first. I mean how doody can a dood get than what you just did. Lol
---
There must be two then. The one I’m talking about is part of the scenery and lies there with a couple of hunters in front of a cave, pinned to a rock. It’s not a npc creature who got just killed.
---
Let me guess: someone stole your sweet roll.
---
They need to make workshops way more valuable. I contributed to a separate post a week ago regarding this. Right now the ammo factory and the junk yard with titanium are really the only workshops people usually want. 
---
**They need to really look at creating new workshops and change existing ones to produce the following specialty items:**
---
\-ballistic fiber
---
\-stealth boys
---
\-nuka cola
---
\-canned food
---
\-purified water
---
\-chems
---
\-screws/springs/gears
---
\-glue
---
\-alcohol
---
\-more ammo-including explosives
---
\-weapon manufacturing (have machines build weapons for scrapping or selling)
---
**Also being able to mass manufacture/harvest/mine the following items:**
---
\-gold/silver
---
\-wood
---
\-concrete
---
\-lead
---
\-aluminum
---
\-titanium
---
\-steel
---
\-copper
---
\-acid
---
\-cloth
---
\-leather
---
\-plastic
---
\-oil
---
\-etc, etc
---
This would make workshops and factories high risk and high reward. I also think each workshop should be mostly consolidated in what you can produce. That makes each individual place somewhat desirable. If all I have to do is go somewhere else to get certain things I probably won't contest.  
---
That factory that produces ballistic fiber 20 times an hour is damn nice. Or the Nuka Cola factory that puts out 4 nuka grape per hour is pretty awesome.  I would fight/defend these places! 
---
This would encourage teamwork and initiate pvp in the adventure servers all at the same time.  If you want to avoid potential pvp you go scrounge like everyone else.
---
There are ways to counter whats that doesn't resort on stealth boys nor cameleon. I enjoy this loot being cheap on trade markets, but you can reduce the distance from which they vats you when you are visible with legendary gear.
---
Played it once, never doing it again.  I love this game but this quest is just not fun at all.
---
Or even just a "are you sure yes or no?" prompt. 
---
The "quit game" selection could use one too, it's right above settings.
---
Used to be really good. They nerfed it last patch. There is no magic bullet for cheap crafting high payout anymore. Diversification is the key. I do a combination of civil war top hats, civil war suits, civil war dresses, and the best...  Marine tactical helmet.  But the real money is in serum crafting now.
---
No problem. Any vendor. You don’t need it the first time through the quest but anytime after you do. Also need fluorescent flux
---
On Xbox and I got on today and I get discounted every 10-20 min
---
I have a anti armour explosive light machine gun which ignores 50% right and since im in power armour most of the time im thinking of ranking up stablized which in power armour heavy guns gain more accuracy and ignore 45% armour of course with 60% more damage with all 3 heavy gunner perks and explosive max to 60% as well is that enough to penetrate through unyielding sentinal armour?
---
Brav If I ever get all the heads Im gonna place them all in a circle with the sbq in the middle under afire place with fancy chairs in front
---
just a confirmation, are you sure? yes/no
---
Maybe I'll set up there. I've been looking for a perfect spot for months. I just moved from Twin Lakes to the raider camo with the frogs
---
I mean, yeah, you can do the quest at your level but it will be challenging for sure. It's very tedious and you'll be doing it out of story order. But you can't get the plans until you join the BoS. If I were on PS4 I'd hook you up. Honestly, the rifle is just a hunting rifle with all the best mods attached for less crafting cost. You can learn all them yourself just by scrapping hunting rifles. It comes equipped with:
---
-Hardened receiver
---
-Stabilized long barrel
---
-Aligned stock
---
-Stinging magazine
---
-Short recon scope
---
-Suppressor
---
\-Hardened receiver
---
\-Stabilized long barrel
---
\-Aligned stock
---
\-Stinging magazine
---
\-Short recon scope
---
\-Suppressor
---
In TF2 it is all literally placed in a folder at tf2\materials\temp
---
Dude same, I had 3 friends playing with me and we had a great time. Then they just quit because no-one else liked it, even though they did.
---
How rare dose this make the western with chaps and travelers outfits? Can’t remember the name of the quests, but Got the western with chaps for barring the remains by the fort and travelers lastnight for killing that plant.
---
send a ticket, they refund me for my pajama mistake at least in pc
---
awsome thanks buddy keep that in mind +karma
---
I get around the problem by just selling all my crafted food (or sometimes giving it to nearby players) and living off the huge store of packaged stuff in my stash. Good way to make caps.
---
Yeah, its mainly the crafting cost, been having trouble finding all the mats to kit out a rifle like that. Pretty sure I have most of the mods at the moment and can craft them. Maybe not the suppressor and recon scope.
---
How you do that?
---
That just makes them mad.
---
There was a cake though. You didn't get the cake, but the cake most certainly existed.
---
if you still have the tse shotgun and are willing to sell I am online although will show offline on xbox just message me there and I will send an invite when you are on
---
You missed an opportunity to respond with I’m not your pal, buddy. But I understand your fear of ptw, but by definition it’s not ptw, there is no real barrier other than weapon/armor level for beating the game.
---
https://help.bethesda.net/
---
So it's another bethesdda bug. I unlocked the ability to craft the things, but the trunk itself was empty.
---
Lol! That is what I have done for the most part. I like to hit up uranium fever and awol armaments when I see them to try to get legendaries. 
---
Still seems crazy that some of these items are so rare.
---
I mean, it's legit that the loot is garbage, and that's a problem, but if you're there long enough, just..get one crit into it and you're going to get your helping of literal trash.
---
The patch before they announce p2w repair kits and fridges, mysteriously items start breaking and rotting faster.
---
It's disgusting and dishonest.
---
Yes I know how to counter vats without legendaries or gear.(crouching)what I meant was that some people don't know how to counter it with out those tools and suggest to remove it from the game mostly in PvP.
---
Aww, sad
---
I have the exact same problem. I just bought kinetic bracers for x01 and it does the same thing and doesn’t let me attach it. Hope this bug gets a fix or I just wasted 400 caps
---
I've scrapped at least 30+ trying to get either a red dot scope or a suppressor... all I can do is keep scrapping...
---
Gotta agree with you here. I was in an argument the other day with a player arguing that griefers can "technically just get into your camp, occupy a workbench and never leave it". And I was like .... ok, so plop another one down next to it and do your thing, let him stand there who cares and the other person went "you're missing the point, there is nothing i can do to get him out of my camp". My only rebuttal is honestly, who cares? If a guy wants to spend 5 hours standing in your camp occupying one work bench, let him? You can just place a second one down and let him waste his time for nothing.  
---
It seems for some people the idea of being trolled is much scarier than actually being trolled. Every time someone has tried to fuck with me I just change servers or block them, why give them a single second of your thoughts? They are not worth it and it's so easy to counter.
---
To me it looks like a fuzzy mirelurk
---
Wait you mean gw and gw2 charr?
---
I've started doing this. I'm only level 19 but I think it all helps and I feel good for paying it along! :)
---
Amen!
---
They also claim to be the strongest, but when I punch one they burst like a wet bag!
---
Use each one a bit and get some kills with them before scraping. I've found that to work best
---
I am very uncertain on this but it should get through a good deal of the armor making it do significantly more damage
---
Hope you can look at Lock And Load as well, it doesn’t work with the Harpoon Gun. The reload animation gets faster but it doesn’t allow you fire afterwards. The bug been there since forever.
---
Just the value I set
---
Yeah I'm level 13, done a few workshops so have had a few plans I didn't need.
---
I appreciate your thoughts and comments
---
I wish your optimism was a little higher, but you might be right.  76 needs to balance both PVE &amp; PVP in the same world.
---
Regardless I’m hoping a better balance can be found.
---
same here iv only ever got one mod for it after scraping atleast 50+ world spawned Radium rifles they just dont drop for me ?...
---
Armor pen only works on DR. Sentinel and assassin reduce damage directly independent of DR which is why its so strong. Its a flat 75% reduction.with a full set.
---
This one gets me, because out of all the things, that is the most ridiculous.
---
Unless you had some ID imprinted on your armor to act as your handprint.
---
It’s the Son Of Fluffy who is alive 😉
---
Well, that escalated quickly.
---
Something like that would at least be a start.  Currently PA users (myself included) as nothing more than sitting ducks.
---
Let me know what you're short on and I might be able to direct you to a source. That'd be easier than what you have to do to join the BoS honestly.
---
This is the problem I'm having! I tried looking in GeForce under the fallout 76 settings. If you could you elaborate where/how you fixed it I would really appreciate it.
---
was it the soaping of the windows? or the Toothpaste?
---
Agreed.  It shouldn’t be one sided.  
---
Those suggestions could be the starting point for great things.
---
Mainly screws I think. Seems I am always short because of base building and weapon modding/crafting.
---
Dolly sod, just below the compass rose,  toxic valley between the dam and diner along the water.
---
Localization. Localization never changes.
---
Seems to be a common problem.
---
As a level 30 something, I also have a way. It involves chameleon and very well timed sprinting.
---
Good point.
---
No. Coming next month.
---
I wish they'd give em to me at a bit lower velocity, lol
---
I feel ya.  It does seem a little different and I can’t put my finger on it either.
---
Maybe Bethesda is looking to add a little something.
---
Yes start posting this all over r/fo76
---
Supposedly they will reappear in patch 9
---
I think of it as a challenge, to jump with the right momentum to land where i wanted to.i believe it is rad-x that can also temporally tone it down
---
No, I need to be at -50 points
---
Lol thanks for the help
---
You gotta shoot em in the head
---
But I said that it’s not pay to win that’s bothering people. Which I think is a term people use to create panic in others.
---
It’s the flat out promise that it would always and only be cosmetic.
---
Ah crap i got a little trade post at camp so for a month its just gonna be an open room with a radio in it.
---
No, the FEV process removes their dangly bits, or at least renders them inoperative and useless.
---
I'm doing my part
---
I believe you can get those from desk fans and typewriters. Try the Charleston Herald building. Do you have screws tagged to search in your PipBoy?
---
Considering how poorly the game was received we are lucky it’s just this
---
I’ve had mods just plain disappear from guns. Long after I’ve learned them or used plans.
---
Also was mentioned very breifly in mothership zeta dlc of Fallout 3. So we know its not completely gone.
---
By reputation they are among the rarest in the game. Don't have the actual RNG percentages.
---
This is great I would love to heal from anywhere on the map
---
Yeah, I accidentally double-tapped and purchased something but I was able to get a refund, as well. Most games will make you have to press a different button or open a confirmation window in order to avoid this. It’s almost like they hope you’ll accidentally buy shit
---
Here is the latest roadmap, they are now saying May 7.
---
[https://imgur.com/a/1lpSBtu](https://imgur.com/a/1lpSBtu)
---
This is a great post
---
toxic valley won't count towards the challenge :)
---
You'd need a bit of luck, and a good scope, but yeah, it'd probably be possible.
---
Yes, I don't think max rank is worth it because the points are more valuable elsewhere, same with blocker, I only use it because I have to have the one point, and it is just extra damage reduction from melee, which is a weakness of this build, but only if you let them get close.
---
If you have ps4 I have tons of plans and recipes
---
You have some cool ideas that would be interesting to see in game.  
---
Having a counter to armor piercing would be nice.
---
Or the ability to take less damage while in a suit of armor...... like the PA.....  it’s crazy that you can still be 1 shotted in PA
---
Oh no! Well since we are confessing. I accidently bought the Bone excavator skin but I am using it and it is kinda cool but I would have waited until it was on sale.
---
You have SBQ head-any chance you fought a SBQ recently-was my theory that they put that one in scorched earth loot pool but just an idea since I can't find it otherwise
---
Cheers, chief!
---
Oh?   Did Bethesda say something finally?
---
Right now you can only find them in the wild, rarely.
---
The toothpaste obviously. What kind of psycho does that? People can get really hurt that way.
---
Yep, exactly the point I’ve been trying to make.
---
I didn't know you could do that. I should have done that for the excavator skin.
---
Yeah, this seems like the most plausible, as the tapes have no true ending, she doesn't say "this is my last etc etc" SO, I assume some future DLC will further her storyline.
---
Can’t make it tonight. The last fight was a blast and anyone concidering going It’s a lot of fun and make sure you get in the ring! The after party is killer!
---
congratulations, you made it to the new difficulty level. once you start doing a lot of damage fast, this starts to happen. Better carry a melee weapon to finish up quests!
---
Had this bug since beta, multiple characters, multiple weapons. Group DPS sets it off the most
---
Yeah I do. Planning on finishing up in morgontown then heading for leader of the pack and then down to charleston when I play tonight.
---
So much to do lol.
---
You can still sell. Make it look good and welcoming. People will come.
---
Maybe like .5k.  1k max.   I have one aswell but I dont see it ever going for a high price unless you have other perks on it
---
You just described basically any Jaguar. Loads of problems, tons of fun to drive. 
---
Would you go to a Jaguar forum and harp on and on about how terrible their cars are because you read about the problems they have and how you can't believe they drive them? No, if you had any common sense you wouldn't. Because no one would care about what you had to say.
---
Maybe have a ladies night to increase foot traffic (?)
---
Yea it seems to not work if it the 2nd stat if it is in The 3rd stat it seems to work...or I might have that reversed
---
Negative Nukashine Rider.
---
What level are yoi
---
Right, I think I have finally learned.
---
I think I have about 1200 .308 rounds what time will you be online? I'll be on most of the night eastern time
---
The problem is sentinel isn't armor its just a direct damage reduction effect so armor pen doesn't help. 
---
Your best best is to try and stagger and knock them out of sentinel. One gun army can work as well as vats crits.
---
Dude, spoilers.
---
When it happened to me Mothman appeared I shoot it it disappeared then a wendigo with pink mist on it came
---
I would honestly have no problem, not saying you shouldn't, with swapping the mutation cards. Adrenal reaction's negative health matters zero to the low health build, and the other downsides I get are -INT from maraupial, and -STR from eagle eyes, which I care about neither stats. So I'm not saying you should or shouldn't, but if you want to get full perk optimization, the negatives to the mutations are not worth mitigating.
---
Is it so much to ask to be able to RP a willing supermutant slave? They are obviously the superior race, so unimmersive.
---
I would personally ditch the witespring ( nuked)  and maybe go on ab bunch of sidequests as they usually have you killing things which gives ex. And they always give a pretty good xp reward at the end o the mission.
---
Glad I could help
---
:/ Sorry.. not sure what I was thinking..
---
About 20-25k caps if anyone ever sold one for caps
---
Treasure maps
---
I think they'll agree with you that a test server is necessary, but in games like Overwatch, barely anyone uses the test server, much less report feedback on it, making it way less helpful
---
Off the top of my head. In the east... Watooga, that forward base south, big bend east, another place north with the moonshine, the red rocket south of Harper's Ferry. But really don't waste your time I've been looking for a T51 left leg for like a month, note I wear T60 but I'm missing that one piece to round off my collection.
---
Hm
---
Well, in that case, I'm glad my ignorance could be of service.
---
I like 3. If you take the workshops they give you fast travel points, too. Use them and vault 76 and your camp to get close to events and just hoof it near them before you join - it saves caps.
---
I wanted the xo1 skull paint! but i did buy the bone raider armor and i think it's the best one because they actually added pieces to it instead off just painting it! lol excavator armor is ugly though!
---
Although the exp isn’t the best, I feel it is still worth it to go to the Whitespring Golf Club and go for the ghouls. However, I recommend you get 2-3 melee weapons that do 80+ damage, and just kinda sit there and beat the crap outta them. Great way to farm stimpaks sometimes too- especially if you have friends that are higher levels that come to the resort, since usually the ghouls will respawn when a new person comes along that area.
---
Omg, that’s a steal.
---
I send mine like 3 month after bc I stopped playing since December but they gimme a one time refund anyway after I explain that it was mistake  xd
---
Also left hand on right side of door lol
---
199. But PA/s are all over the place.
---
I suggest just crafting it then
---
I see people selling them and didn’t think they were that rare.
---
I just scrapped a bunch of t51 legs.....
---
I should be able to make ya a few if you want
---
The only things I've seen for sure is the vending and the ability to allow pur camps to be marked so others can find them.
---
Yep, that’s how I ended up with the shag carpeting. But, no regrets. I use it in most of my camp now. It sucks to buy something you’ll really never use. You can’t even gift it to people.
---
Pve instigating, pvp bloodied. Queen fights bloodied.
---
Haha
---
Stupid umans talk too much
---
I can make a kitted out set of level 20 studded heavy leather for him. And possibly some under armor. 
---
Gt: WinterImmersion.
---
Looking at your perks, I literally see no reason why I am pulling more damage... when I log in, before any drugs or consumables of any kind, I always go to 20% hp or just under by getting irradiated. Then I check my pip boy and look at my Gauss Rifle's DMG. It will always be at 1024 when 20% and goes up to like 1140 when at 5% hp.
---
I only know because I check it every time, I notice that when nerd rage is not active, and I am at about 25-30% hp, my Gauss is sitting at 850 something.
---
This honestly boggles my mind, if Adrenal reaction is working and your rifle is lv 45, bloody, explosive, and you have the same damage boosting perks, I have no clue why your rifle is dealing less. And it is even weirder that the TSE is dealing more for you, when its opposite for me.
---
You can, it's just like changing your make up or scars.
---
I got a AAE DB on PS4, most people don’t realize the explosive effect keeps the pellets in a tight spread.  The DB ends up being damn closer to a sniper.  It can 1 shot level 68 super mutants from across the Wes Tek parking lot.  Incredibly under rated weapon IMO and worth Max Caps easy
---
Chem station.
---
The only time I've had it not drop anything is when I didn't hit the thing enough when it was vulnerable.
---
Chemistry bench
---
WTF would weightless accomplish when its the chassis weight we actually have to deal with??
---
Feel free to make your own suggestions, ideas, and a few balance changes! Opinions are accepted, of course!
---
What level is it? What stars and what effects beyond vamp?
---
I remember a time when I had to click ten times just to play a game! Can you imagine! Ten clicks! 
---
5 clicks is an absolute travesty, but, 10!
---
Thank you so much
---
Cooking station I believe.
---
Don’t have them unlocked.
---
This. Also it is helped by ammosmith.
---
I read it a week ago somewhere
---
Getting this tonight when I get home and login from this clip alone.
---
You can get a full set of heavy combat armor while doing the event at the watoga high school
---
Yeah I would totally set up an in game tattoo parlor. I could name it "Lucky's" and give free face tattoos that say "Bad Luck".
---
Power Armour.
---
Oh wait wrong thing lol just do the enclave quest
---
I'll take it if you're on xb1.
---
Yeah this is what I’ve been trying to do, however all my friends moved on 😔 so solo is the only way right now.
---
So far I haven’t been successful because most of the time the ghouls are spawned as level 45 normals or 62 bloated due to high levels frequenting the area. When I can kill them, a high level shows up and starts wiping them out before I can deal damage.
---
Damn, this was your one shot to tell everyone how bad they are and you fucked it up. You'll get it next time though, I believe in you.
---
Hey be careful naming anyone on here. Even if for good stuff, some people might go out of their way to go troll/or raid them.
---
Seriously.
---
I know the game says it isn't supposed to matter, but I am level 185 just to compare. It is entirely possible that it is a bug as well, adrenal was messed up for awhile, Bethesda said basically to get rid and re apply. Alot of people did that, but I never did. I never messed with my mutations, and I waited for them to fix it. They finally did, and my numbers went back to where they were. I saw alot of reports of different damage fluctuations for some people however.
---
Just a thought, I don't know what it is, I will list all my active status effects and special values when I get home.
---
You would think, people would learn after the first rocket what a trap is.
---
Can't play now, but add me "iAMDK in AL" I think im level 104, dont remember.  just started playing again after a couple of months.
---
Destiny 1 had two pretty infamous quests for exotic hand cannons: Thorn, and The First Curse. 
---
Thorn had one quest step where you needed to get a certain number of PvP kills using void weapons (the game has ballistic weapons and three elemental weapon types: solar, arc, and void), but there was a catch: each kill netted you 5 points, but each death cost you 2. As long as you were able to maintain a positive kill/death ratio, you'd eventually get there, but many players remember the quest for Thorn as a brutal slog.
---
The First Curse mixed things up a bit for the PvP step. After completing a few preliminary steps, eventually you'd get a hand cannon called Imprecation, which was a horrible, awful, no good piece of trash. Your goal was to march into the Crucible (the game's PvP mode) and complete a match with seven precision kills with Imprecation. This was *not* easy, given how awful Imprecation was. I can't count the number of games where I finished with like 5 or 6 precision kills. So frustrating. But going through that exercise taught you how to pace your shots, plan your engagements, and land precision hits, which is a playstyle in which The First Curse excelled.
---
GT GrumpyDude.  I will be on try to hook up with you. Sounds like a plan. Cheers
---
Your the firsts to comment you get one cool point
---
Weapons workbench. make a new level 30 flamer. it gives you 100 flamer fuel, scrap the flamer. super duper activating does not give 200 ammo, only 100
---
I'd love an alpha prime deathclaw that could eat your head while in pa
---
People are running around in sheep's clothing ..... is that better or worse?
---
They should at least be able to slap you in the face with their big green penises though!
---
Had an issue last night where one floor square was glitching.
---
Perhaps in the Wastelanders DLC? Maybe we'll find her alive?
---
PA works great for PVE, there is no doubt about that.
---
For PVP, I still don’t believe that there is a PA build that would win against the top 3 nonPA builds.
---
So far I haven’t been convinced
---
The event cosmetic drops seems so random. And I dont wanna buy cause I love earning it and getting that drop.
---
Eh it depends. Its not a bad idea but implementation is much harder than theory crafting, there are lots of steps and changes that might be needed to implement it. 
---
All of those changes could break the game, or lead to exploits and as we have seen with duped gear, once its out there its difficult to get rid of. 
---
Its always important to try and remember realism in suggestions.
---
Thank you, fellow Liberator, glory to the People’s republic
---
There is theories but we can only speculate
---
Fixer plans
---
PA jetpack plans
---
I’ve lost so many caps traveling to events that don’t exist...greater than 50% of the time.   Weird.
---
VATS criticals ignore sentinel and assasins effect and actually almost all the armor dmg resistance too. So even if sentinel can take 1000 dmg hits point blank it goes down to few 50 dmg crit shots
---
From the ashes of America. West China will rise
---
Yup:/
---
Where do you get the radstag one? All the one at the farm where you needed to find out the origins of the albino animals gave me was a calmex and bufftats
---
But you can pop a stealth boy and make vats useless
---
I guess then they could add ass. PA Legendary pieces to fix that?  I honestly don’t think it needs a legendary fix in PVE thou.
---
So basically the PA is only good with PVE
---
All the more reason for some legendary items/ mods!!!!!
---
So did I but I was still able to finish the quest. Though I wonder if I got the fill reward. Didn’t get any plans for mounted heads

bloodied 2 hand power armor/bloodied explosive/bloodied unarmed

option of three builds makes playing it never get old
---
also between the three builds you can tackle any scenario from queen runs to mobbin in nukes to blowing shit up!

Good thing I'm a trash collector.
---
Thanks for the ideas
---

---
It’s not an idea if it’s already being done.

I just eat the all at once or wait 10 minutes and finish them.
---
I love the hilarity of the hit rock bottom weekly
---
Agreed.  There isn’t many creatures, or boards of creatures that I fear in my PA.....
---
But you get one punk with a killer build and I’m down in one shot....
---
that's the one! thanks dude +karma
---
Its like where the floor meets the top of the wall below it. Its annoying and will not stop no matter what
---
WTG
---
Yea mine is where the floor meets the wall its above it flashes and will not go away no matter what I try
---
Personally never understood why people prefer selling hats over killing enemies getting xp and loot to sell, however I made a killing grinding for the plans
---
My food seems to last decently long for a 2-3 hour play session. If I'm running low I normally keep some non-perishable food on me or make some grilled meat in the world if  I find a cooking station.
---
The Civil War Era Top Hat costs less materials and is worth more Caps than the Brotherhood Soldier Suit, so I don't know why someone would be selling those?
---
What's your build? Armor?
---
It’s a numbers game that was rigged from the start.
---
Still sounds quieter than my upstairs neighbors.
---
Right!? Having to write messages with my Xbox controller sucks big time.
---
I would've sat there and listened. Sheepsquatch hunting is a spectator sport, and besides, it drowns out the Resource Collectors and Generators.
---
Gets boring a little after you beat the missions and build a nice house then I just pop in and see what f I can't get a good weapon or scavenge some areas
---
I know. Just saying I’ve been to 6 vendors and each one is bloated with both rifles and suits. Either one is not aware or multiple people are trying to make them caps.
---
Darn. Still a weird coincidence, though.
---
Ya I don’t pvp, no worries there.  Also it’s insane weight management wise as the chassis weighs nothing while on you and full time PA means no other heavy armor needed.  Add in shocks... it’s easy street
---
I'll be glad to help
---
Excavator has one.
---
Mine is at the wall too. Just flashes around the border of the square. Haven't looked at it today yet though.
---
Boss events. Got a chest a few days ago.
---
Are you proud of that pun?
---
It's all about your perks and gear. You can be level 300 with a bad build and gear and get killed by a level 30 super mutant easy.
---
我们会在黎明时袭击
---
For the enclave!
---
negative. havent touched the game in months lol sorry
---
"No green stuff here."
---
*Is standing next to huge tank of green stuff.*
---
Yeah I feel that to some extent. A easy way to do that would be to group people on servers based on how many player kills they have. I run sent on my adventure character and cav on my survival character because most people do. Its wack when youre in a fight and literally everyone is invisible, its easy to deal with but its just not fun.
---
Bravo
---
Yep exactly. My friend just started building today and has the same issue
---
No worries. Still appreciate the work you put into this.
---
I will be honest I didn’t read every comment but has anyone brought up the big with the mods yet? I finally found a x-01 calibrated shock and decided to go see if I could put it on my armor, I verify that I have all needed materials and attempt to apply it to one of my legs. It goes through the prompt are you sure you want to replace current mod ( side note there is no mod on them currently) I select yes it never applies. So I gathered up a few friends and couldn’t get any mods on any gear.
---
More scrap? Occasionally? Like 3 pieces of steel?
---
Health and armour don’t increase with level, only through looting better gear, mutations, and the right perks will you get stronger
---
I've made better ones. Saw an opportunity and I took it.
---
Rad x barrel. Shoot someone and suppress there mutations lol
---
I love you, my psn is actually let me message you that
---
I begrudgingly give you my upvote.
---
If I know anything about anything. If a big green man says to you. I have a treat for you. The only option you have is to run away. That "treat" is never good.

I mainly use melee and long ranged rifles, occasionally I will use a combat shotgun. I have last bastion* lvl 40, leaded tempered trapper L-arm lvl 45,  shadowed muffled combat R-arm lvl 50, pocketed buttressed raider L-leg  lvl 45, sturdy BOS R-Leg lvl 30. And brotherhood soldier under suit. I can post a pic of my perks if needed
---
But then you can't jump overstuff.
---
Not a bad idea! I'll add that to the Negatives section, and I'll be sure to say you helped as well!
---
When no model is prefaced, it's always going to be an Excavator mod.
---
Got all of them in one try at the power plant. From the bridge on 65 with a black powder rifle.
---
I've been having a similar problem with my custom floors. Since the new patch they have been glitching like crazy and it's very off putting.
---
If anything, I think sheepsquatch event is far more stable then the SBQ one. Runs smooth like a piece of butter. Boss like to teleport around a bit but that's acceptable. At least he don't fly away and never return
---
Just think it would be funny to hit someone as they jump of a cliff only to find bird bones isnt working lol
---
Boomer never has a job for me, either. Haven't picked flowers in a long time. You are not alone.
---
Sometimes... traveling to the quest location has worked for me... for some of them... not usually, though.
---
Okay I was like you and thought Melee would suck, lol and that IS the big big opps lol. Take yes play just like these folks said. One thing they didn't say. I looked for with my alt there are "towers" you can climb up to the top of they will give you move places to find on the map HUGE help. I didn't figure out that was how I was "finding" new spots on my map on my main until I read a post on this site and I had found all but all the damn towers but 2... lol
---
My house... like every time I log in...
---
Let it give us hotdog recipes, err raddog? Dograds? 
---
Nukadogs?
---
Yes, but only for this specific weapon ?
---
All other mods are learned just fine.
---
No... the scorched killer reciever is so not star worthy. At all. Machete mod might be... but do not be fooled by four star guns.
---
Whoever I join, everything is invisible for at least a minute. 
---
I’m sitting there dying and not able to kill anything because I can’t see any enemies.
---
you have no idea how a rep grind on this game would work. 
---
People hate WoW rep grind because it's time gated. I have a set amount of rep I can get each day and then I have to go off and come back when the world quests reset.
---
On this game it'll probably be event based. And events aren't daily. You can grind them as much as you like for as long as you like.
---
What good is extra fire rate when you can't keep it fueled?
---
ineptitude?
---
It's just RNG.
---
First flea market is tomorrow at 3pm EST! GT is jacobjtl
---
Pretty sure there's no update next week. The Burrows stuff is already in the game but locked. I think 4/23 would be the earliest barring a hot fix.
---
And increase the crafted ammount by 5 times.
---
Well I will take that for sure.  Cut back on my reddit time

But not a lot lol.
---
Here is a problem to I have been having trying to play the event
---
Problem: People doing the event and not hitting pylons and just shooting at a invisible creature. Another is people hitting the pylons and rushing the creature. 
---
Solution to this problem: Don't be a fucking idiot
---
"Thankfully I have healing factor "
---
Got bad news for you
---
Maybe it adds an effect similar to the calibrated shocks?
---
Maybe a collective -50 will work?

I just posted a build that can support, tank AND heal for a group. Check it out!

---
It's okay. Just leave the toothpaste in your own Camp and maybe bring an extra Wendigo to make up for it.
---
You have 2 options HP AND AP.
---
you’re saying crouching does NOT USE AP?.  Lolz 
---
Also, the OP DID NOT MENTION POWER ARMOR
---
YOU should read!
---
🤣🤣🤣 I gotta ask. Would you have made the same joke?
---
Yep we don't :D
---
Yeah, I'm just mad you made it first.
---
😂 Sorry buddy! Next time!
---
Just made this Tank + Support + Healer build  
---
Healing Factor, but it's opposite day.
---
Whatever it is, it extends to a global quest chain (Babylon\_Intro\_HolotapeQuest) as it has a global quest expire trigger.
---
The scenes also point to a quest with a boss at the end. Later scenes in the questline (after the 4 scenes of holotape dialog take place) have the Actor behaviors "Death End" and "Combat End". They are linked to actions but those actions are empty, no scripting.
---
“Next month” according to Bethesda? I haven’t played this game in ages and suddenly had an urge to play it so I decided to look at the sun reddit while my PlayStation is turning on. If there’s on e thing I remember about the updates it’s that “next month” always somehow turned into “4 months”
---
I hope to god they never do this. It would make regular armor completely obsolete and ruin the balance of a game that already has dubious balance at best. Fucking millennials wanting all the benefits of everything without any drawbacks or having to work for anything.
---
I just got the game yesterday and have had similar experiences. This has been wonderful.
---
how about I add an Albino Deathclaw wearing a clown outfit and carrying a Plasma chaingun?
---
&gt; That would screw up the whole mechanic, though. Anyone contesting a workshop would be sniped by someone just outside the circle, and hence invincible. 
---
I get what you're saying and you're right but these aren't hard issues to resolve. PvP doesn't initiate for both parties until both parties are in the circle, so the zero slap damage would still apply. You could have some other mechanic. The main point is you shouldn't be in PvP when you're nowhere near your workshop.
---
Nice. Good advice. Haven't experienced this yet but I'm sure I will.
---
You could probably sell it for 50 caps or so to a collector. 
---
But normally people don't use handmades for the queen but for general gameplay and PvP which a prime reciever would be a weakness on.
---
Materials...in this case mostly junk and flux
---
We’re all just in a Tranquility Lane simulator.
---
8 times for me!
---
Oi, share the love for Deathclaws!
---
I was wondering the exact same thing. The best I could come up with is possibly allowing the Chameleon mutation to work with a full Weightless set of Power Armor. Which would be much the same as the regular armor Weightless Legendary aside from weight not mattering with a Power Armor piece.
---
There's quite a few rolls scattered around WS. Breaks down into cloth i think.
---
Both TS and E have been nerfed. Explosive is supposedly 30% of base damage and TS is only +25% damage not double.
---
So click on FO76 in Geforce, Next to the 'optimize' button is a wrench tool. Click on that and try changing it from 'full screen' to 'windowed'. At that point you may be able to move the screen into view and change the display settings. I think I did that to fix my issue.
---
Pc
---
Me too. I've been doing the next best thing: covering my friend's camp in fastnacht confetti like a post apocalyptic Rip Taylor
---
I personally love the ones who drag it like 100 yards Into the woods so even when we have 3 conducters it's impossible to find
---
....lol jk we rarely ever have 3 conducters because people would rather shoot invisible air and eyebombs
---
Stupid gamer speak.
---
Just wasted my card to this. As a level 70 why am I the only one acting as conduit? Annnnd it's failed.
---
i have whole bunch of them, will test my luck.
---
There’s a timer on it so if you can’t do it you have to wait 3 hrs because some one just did it in that server. Ooooor you could just to a few different servers and try them there. Good luck 👍
---
its a common glitch, it also lets you apply it to the Ultracite power armor's arm
---
Walking into a mini gun is gonna shred that armor. Period.
---
Hmm. Kind of expected that, but it's still a bit of a bummer. I'd love to have a separate pool just for items I'm selling, but if there's some negative impact on server stability, I'll live without the extra space.
---
Do we know any details on how legendary re-rolls works? I've heard something about tokens, but I haven't seen much in the way of specifics. Might have to pick and choose what 3 stars I keep for the next month or so.
---
Critical hits actually deal damage. They bypass the damage reduction. Damage is based off a weapons base damage, before bonuses. So you could use a black powder weapon (which have some of the highest base damage in the game) with a couple critical bonus perks/effects and easily deal the maximum damage cap to them.
---
Nvm. I was going to give you 5 free mutation serums if you were on Xbox.
---
I just want Nukashine darts I can shoot annoying people with.
---
Yep. I cleared the mine then did Uranium Fever today. After scrapping, I had 700 pounds on me (400 more than normal). I got 1100 caps from the haul though.
---
I agree. Even an assault rifle shreds me and the armor up. My armor sucks but in order to get better armor I need to grind high levels but I die because I have shitty armor 😔
---
So far no. The tokens are in game but not much else. He does have 5 legendary weapons assigned to him currently but no info other than that.
---
It was very efficient before the last patch. Now it's mostly useless.
---
I have significantly more intelligence than one of my teammates. Roughly 12 points more. There isn't any large change in our exp earned normally its very close. Sometimes exact, we are a few levels apart. 
---
Its far from conclusive though as no rigorous test have been done, just my personal anecdote.
---
SPOILER! Vault 96 is exactly this! An Embryo and seed bank
---
The chances of getting a mod go up with your intel maybe the radium rifle has an naturally lower mod find chance ?
---
Andrew is dead on. For me, I do marine tactical helmet and water when I need caps.
---
One spawns in the historic building in helvetia.
---
I've always killed enough enemies to loot and sell playing the game to make my 1400 daily, and it never impacted my game play. I never understood the hat thing.
---
It's just way too buggy to spend 2k caps, all you stims and ammo on. Its a buggy mess half the time
---
I said "I bet you're the kind of guy that camps high traffic areas and spawn kills people to make quick caps huh"
---
You said "I do that of course"
---
So maybe learn to remember better or learn how to pull up your past comments before you make yourself look like a fool... Again
---
1100 hours, same here. But they are pretty cheap on market 7-15k.
---
Ease off the nukashine
---
TIL, ty!
---
24 people on a server at a time would mean a maximum of 48 tiny .jpeg/.png/.whatever files to load...not a huge deal
---
Camping high traffic areas is different from spawn killing noobs
---
The blackouts will have to go, however the other parts can stay. Do you want it to be a negative barrel or a positive one?
---
Thank you very much
---
LOL
---
And you can’t spawn kill. You have like 30sec immunity when spawning
---
My husband and I made this known days ago, but of course you have the trolls chiming in talking like they know it all &amp; refute any nerfs as if their lives depended on it, then every other troll agrees with the leader troll only to have your honest and factual post thumbed down into oblivion... I hate reddit and all the children who dwell here, you should have been aborted.
---
Can you imagine pushing a release without unit tests?  Without checking the merge conflicts?  We can't do it on a couple hundred dollar job, let alone a piece of multi multi million dollar software.
---
Awesome thank you!
---
Farm with with All Rise and switch to PA either a 50 cal or gatling plasma. Still hoping to get a AA 50cal
---
I just hope we get something for the new Godzilla movie like a Ghidorah skin for power armor or a Godzilla one...
---
Hell posters or statues even!
---
I've spawned under the white springs golf club building three times now.  Under it, because the server it's so stupid and slow that I could watch the spawn build on top of me.  
---
The update wasn't bad, but the hotfix... Holy Moly. Blue screens galore! Join a team? No, blue screen!  Sell some Shit? Blue screen.  
---
My PA also takes forever to load in, which is going to get me killed because I much prefer running around in my bathing suit and wait as long as I can to put it on.
---
Regarding the second issue, it may be that you unlocked the mod for a different item. For example, I've been scrapping marine armor trying to get the buttressed mod for a chest piece. So I got the message that it unlocked but it turns out it was for arms, not chest, but the message just says I unlocked the buttressed mod. It doesn't specify which piece it's for, which is super annoying.
---
i just want the mounted beaver,  GIGGITY
---
Ya dood 👌
---
I will be on in a few and give you a set of armor that should be better than your current
---
Can you hook a switch to it?
---
Currently there's no way to drop an actual in-world item, though you have an as-legitimate-as-any reason right here.  The paper bag thing should either be optional or should go away entirely.
---
Wow okay thanks 🙏
---
No, don't worry. But i recommend playing the new quest. Very good
---
Haven't transferred anything in the last couple weeks. But the paper bag method always worked for me. Usually my friend is actually accessing the bag menu while I'm switching characters. Never lost anything.
