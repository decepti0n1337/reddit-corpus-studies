Bloodied weapons or explosive ones.
---
Found ONE explosive +25% faster fire rate minigun at level 65 while browsing a level 500+s vendors. Cost me 200 caps and still is one of the best weapons I‘ve got
---
---
---
well you might want to wait as apparently there's a sale coming up., I think the 3\* were down to 75 scrip. I haven't actually seen anything official about this. Just repeating what i've seen on here.
---

---
I have 4 alts and 3 of them are sitting on 900+ scrip now. Just waiting to see what happens
---
 Endurance is a nice to have but most folk sacrifice it in the end. Honestly about the only desease to give a fig about is rad worms. You get some other dodgy ones like rattle hands but thats about it. Never had the Whoopsies but my luck is shite at this game anyway lol...
---
it should be lifelong so you can recognize people you’ve played with before but didn’t friend.
---
This only happens when you‘re in power armor. 
---
This thing needs to be reworked.
---
i think it is less a grand conspiracy or tactical bug testing....  
---
and more just bethesda being bethesda.
---
they have multiplayer code bolted onto an outdated single player engine, a way smaller team than conventional live service games, and a terrible bug riddled history.
---
rando bugs pop up for me all the time, in every play session.  few fully break the game, but then again, during the parade days... it literally took me days before i was able to get the dmv quest to actually work due to a terminal not working for me.
---
Do you have Radicool Perk?
---
There have been multiple posts of people "doing the math" that said you would be short, but only one of them (that I saw) factored in the double XP and score weekends and the result was there were points to spare. I just can't find it -_- I think it factored in doing the repeatable once a day
---
Like I said, it sucks for a stealth build, but is great if you are a tank and want the attention.
---
If you have a &gt;60hz monitor, force vsync off and set max framerate to your refresh rate through nvidia control panel.
---
I have a tse laser rifle not bloodied or instigating and it destroys pretty much everything but the sbq but it breaks so quick
---
Mmmmmaaaaaybe in the future. From the Patch 20 datamines, we've seen a skeleton on a stand, like you'd find in a classroom, and another of the same thing wearing a hat.
---
.
---
Now, it could be two different ones, like the Vaultboy pointing and the Vaultboy pointing while wearing a party hat, or it *might* be a dressable skeleton. I dunno yet.
---
But I'm a-watchin', believe you me. Soon as we can, my CAMP is getting a clothing store, you'd best believe!
---
Yea no negative effects from not eating or drinking, so no need for food and water loss reductions perks
---
Sale coming up this week. But yea generally 2 star weapons are a good deal until you have a decent weapon. Then go 3 star all day long.
---
Don't take my word for it as I heard it secondhand and don't know the source but apparently in patch 22 they are removing the food and drink debuffs. If they do this though they would definately need to rework the END tree. But probably wont
---
Not surprised. They spawn u inside the nuke zone when u r obviously dying outside the nuke zone...
---
No problem :D
---
This is pretty cool, bu this feature would be so cool and immersice but at the same time we have more urgent things to fix. For example vats, the entire pvp system and balance, the new bugs on the score system and the issues regarding weapons
---
What was your response time before?
---
BOS Recon Rifle, you get the plan while doing brotherhood quest line.  This rifle can be crafted as low as level 1,5,10,etc. and uses very little resources to craft.  They can easily find .308 ammo for it.  Or do them a bigger favor and install a .50 cal receiver and drop them 300 rounds for it.  You’ll be a legend.
---
Oh geeze, somebody wants 'em? I'll toss some in my machines when I get off work tonight. Always happy to do my part!
---
It’s not you, it’s just how the game is.
---
Well, I’m not doing the repeatable once a day. I haven’t been able to. I’m just doing the dailies (and the weeklies) and turning off the game.
---
Only if you run bloodied, Non PA. Like I do.
---
Then high damage, explosion &amp; rad resist become very important which cost you perk points that you could use for something else.
---
If you're on PC, I always keep the basics (Acid, lead, steel) in there, but I'll happily toss anything else in on request. Whatcha looking for?
---
It would be quicker I'm sure, but I'm generally levelling up once a day at the moment anyway, just from general eventing. Line in the Sand is my go to. 
---
Lvl 100 - 1000 needs 15880 xp per level, so levelling up also gives me the bonus 100 score, sometimes 200 on my main. I'm pretty sure the amount of xp per kill goes down as lvl increases though.
---
[July 9](https://reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hjz7tq/itv_july_2_2020/)
---
It would be as simple as giving it its own caliber or just convert it to another heavy weapon caliber its really not rocket science
---
18.
---
The game has a lot of bugs
---
Just at rank 3 but I only play a couple of hours at a time on weekends. I'll never see rank 25 much less 50 or 100. For me personally and my game play, the rewards don't really appeal to me anyway and i have no desire to do NW at all so its not worth grinding it out. To each his own though.
---
Man, I usually sell 'em for 10. I should look at bringing the price up a bit.
---
(Adds 10 MM to the list as well.) Man, tonight's gonna be  a ton of restock.)
---
Keep up the complaints to Bethesda, there needs to be a papertrail of tickets, so far they seem to be auto locking these tickets insisting that they won't do anything to help with lost score...
---
Dude was actually pretty funny, I picture his name is Vinny and he was playing from the manager's office of a side street pizza joint in NYC.
---
Wow. Did you come up with that all on your own? What a great job. You're so special and interesting, and clever!
---
Why don't you stop stealing your neighbour's wifi and stop being an entitled little brat.
---
Happy to sell 'em! Just let me know what you're after and into the machine they go.
---
Most of a day, it's the longest.
---
I was wondering, especially after my router went down this morning. Wifi/Hardwire I can reset it by logging into the cable provider app on my phone, except when I don't have internet and I lose service walking out of my door.
---
My turrets do this to humans, it doesn't seem to be a racial issue.
---
The only thing I use it for is to get rid of unwanted missiles and nukes.
---
I also forgot to mention my party was also going through this, so its a bug? Is it a frequent bug?
---
Which chems? I never know what people are after, so I rarely put 'em in but I have loads.
---
Thanks man, I think we'll all find out on the 16th.
---
I actually run two Berserker's builds (heavy and commando) and they have been my favorites so far. It's a bit more work to initially get setup, but there is a thrill to running at 0 DR.
---
The trick to Berserker's is damage mitigation. Before they nerfed the legendary Radicals Mask I was able to tank in most situations due to achieving 90% damage reduction, it's back to 75% now using a full set of named armor.
---
There are 2 addictions that give -10 DR each (-20 DR total), so I can wear Raider's underarmor and a full set of level 1 armor while staying at 0 DR. So I carry a ton of legendary armor around on me and change it out depending on situation getting 75% damage reduction. A full set only weighs about 2.6 lbs, so it's not as big of a deal as you might think.
---
- Zealot's - SBQ event
---
- Troubleshooter's - Encryptid, Silos, AWOL
---
- Ghoul Slayer's - Whitespring
---
- Mutant Slayer's - West Tek
---
- etc, etc...
---
If not in a specific event Life Saving pieces along with Mysterious Savior can keep you on your feet. Blocking, Serendipity and Dodgy are good as well.
---
Sounds about right
---
Bethesda should make an app for 76. Killed it in 4 why not 76
---
Never happened to me either.
---
What makes you think it’s a bug? PA does not eliminate rads in a nuke zone.
---
No. It seems to have stopped after a few server hops. Not sure what is happening
---
Some weapons max out at level 45.
---
Specially when it keeps glitching out and refusing to pay out!
---
Tell your sister to stay off of your computer.
---
Which ones are you after? The normal stuff, I sell at 10% cost. Rare ones are more, but, well, that's rare. (hah). I was just unloading a bunch of Fastnacht stuff for 10 caps each last night. Make a request! I may have one somewhere. (The main one I'm missing is a Fixer plan... sold my last one about two months ago and haven't yet gotten another.)
---
I don’t see the point but I guess if ya want it they should add it
---
Go to Big Al’s Tattoo Shop in Morgantown. In the bar “The Nukashine” (basement)...you can find a wood one at the bar. ☺️
---
Could you imagine if Power Armor enabled Doom/God of War gore kills. Oh my goodness
---
I never came close to max. Im not sure how people make so much. I dont have that many legendary weapons, most break for 3, dailies might give me 20~
---
You dont have to be at the same event for it to work. Just need to be in a team while you play solo.
---
if you didn't pack your current character full of rare plans or awesome legendaries.... i'd just start a new character.  having been in the same boat as you (high level returning for wastelanders) it was kinda rubbish and very boring doing the wastelanders quests.
---
had to revisit a lot of low level places, woulda been nice to just knock it all out in one go.  be prepared to GRIND.  most of the new stuff from wastelanders is locked behind a reputation grind and then behind a currency grind.
---
also the new seasons thing is busted, a scam, and unfortunately packed with rubbish consumables in between the actually cool drops.
---
keep your eyes on the atomic shop though, there's been several solid items and packs pass through.  good handful of utterly rubbish ones too though.  i personally recommend keeping your eyes open for the springtime pack.  getting nice, living trees works wonders for making a camp seem awesome.
---
and finally, i can only vouch for sophia the astronaut ally... she's awesome.  the questline was a little fetch heavy, but it was a decent, well written, and interesting storyline.  she would have made a great addition to the cast of fallout 4 as a legit companion.  shame all she amounts to in 76 is a daily giver and barbie doll.
---
Depends on your play style?
---
Are you aiming for quests and events?
---
Or are you doing boss runs like the SQB?
---
Barbarian, Junk shield, lone wanderer, mutations, evasive, dodgy are very helpful damage resist for low health builds.
---
Now that you mention it im starting to remember that, one thing that it did do it went from +1 to +60 rads I had to get out of the nuke zone is that a bug?
---
This is great! Thanks. I had no idea
---
Welcome
---
It's not a bug. If you want less rads wear a chinese stealth suit or hazmat suit, that will be less than 1 rads.
---
You mean a faster firerate &amp; an explosive one ... ?
---
He's not 50 yet. He may feel like spending scrip on items below max level is a waste and I would agree.
---
Where can I find this stealth suit?
---
Please bring that to Scorched Earth immediately.
---
Thank you so much for the kind words!
---
Yeah I wanted to show it off at different times of day, mainly because I spent so much time getting the lighting right (for night).  It can be pretty tough to light up a big space, especially with the 50 light limit, so I had to be relatively conservative with them. It turned out pretty well though, especially given how limited the warm lighting options are. Most of it is comprised of those hanging colored bulbs (set at orange #2/mid-brightness), lanterns, and the fancy light posts...all of which emit very warm, cozy lights.
---
Thanks again, It took a considerable amount of time to get the foundation/skeleton of the structure how I wanted it.  I thought the combination of different building materials helped sell the somewhat "ramshackle, thrown-togetherness" of the house. Same with offsetting the actual floors, as if different pieces of different homes were smashed together.  It also just makes it a bit more interesting and lively, as opposed to a traditional, more boxy home, or even a more traditional looking house.
---
Yeah I'll see about recording something tomorrow morning! I'll go through the camp today, gather my thoughts, and hopefully won't ramble on too much when I record.  I'll upload it and send you a link once it's up!
---
Thanks again for the nice reply, I appreciate it!
---
There's a metal and wood at the whitesprings resort bar.
---
No don’t spend it, save the scrip up
---
After 1 year + we still do not have textchat in a multiplayer game like wtf?
---
I want trading Chanels , group channels , private messages , event channels
---
I love you so much, thank you!
---
Did any of your armor break?
---
He's the only one that's come to my camp since I installed the turrets, since they are pretty much useless im only using them for looks now
---
Just scrip them if you don’t plan on using them. Don’t spend it til after 50. But no need to wait if you don’t plan on using them
---
24
---
Lol. You are welcome! ☺️☺️☺️
---
I'd really like the ghillie secret service armour mod. It's around 80. If and when I get that, I'll be happy.
---
Hey ghouls are humans too. Ghoullivesmatter
---
Ever since I came to this sub it's non stop bitching about stuff, it's kinda of depressing. It's just the same shit over and over.
---
Nope had everything fully repaired
---
 [https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/score.html](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/score.html)
---
The first Queen I fought would not take any damage. The second Queen that I just fought didn't give me any XP or loot when she died so I was pissed off!
---
Same here lol
---
https://youtu.be/UUnOYA-jFrI
---
And thats without factoring in the double XP/score weekends, so you'll be able to get to 100 with no issue
---
What does you paying for it have to do with anything? This should be added for all floors, regardless of whether they are atom shop or not. There are no solid half floors, which is annoying. Even more annoying is no half walls(width)!
---
I did it a couple weeks ago.  No regrets.
---
Boost stops at 100%, so 5 wastes a lunchbox
---
+60 seems a little much for power armor. I don’t know.
---
Thanks for letting me know about that - I didn't understand that meaning of that option since I don't know how to play As NW. Unfortunately this challenge required teammates, and I'm guessing that future ones will as well. I think Bethesda wants to get people to play NW, but didn't consider this might make it worse for those who are serious NW players.
---
ballistic fiber is a solid buy too.  not super common as junk in the game world and needed for all the higher tier armor repairs.
---
if the player vendors are janky and i'm at the cap, i'll buy a good handful and ferret it away for a rainy day
---
full disclosure i'm at the point where the only plans left for me to buy are the ones for items i don't use.
---
Awesome, thank you so much! That's at least two a day I can find now!
---
I mean I agree it should be all floors. It just hit harder with one I paid for. Half width walls are also needed for sure
---
Yes it makes sence, because right before the SBQ  they did pvp and turned each other  to goo, probably they were trying to recreate the circumstances to enter god mode, OMG how hard is for bethesda to make players Not to turn in to goo after death?,they did it for scorchbeaasts and the SBQ,in fact they should make it so that nothing turns to goo after death.
---
It's repurposed Skyrim dragon code, the same code that makes dragon corpses drop out of the sky and land on you whenever you fast travel.
---
Depends what platform you are on and what design you want
---
You gotta log out before resets apparantly but dam that sucks lol
---
I’m still grinding with this. Sucks when you die and your team goes on you don’t get extra xp. I have to get the outfits yet and that’s it
---
And the new owner will probably be a douche and lock them.  It's a win/win for them.  They get a workshop, plus they don't have to build extractors.  Not that they cost much, since the workshop gives you the mats to build them, mostly.
---
Around
---
Switch to melee once in awhile. I assume you are using automatic weapons? You should buy your ammo or find a more efficient way to craft. There are some guides on here for that.
---
The public event at Camp Adams has a small chance to reward a possum badge upon completion. I've done it a few dozen times and have gotten roughly 4-6 badges from it. Just keep your eye out for it when it pops up.
---
On another note, you can remotely access and start the two Pioneer Scout dailies from your personal terminal, which you can get for free in the Atom Shop (somewhere). Both of these dailies have a small chance to rewards a possum badge upon completion.
---
Thanks! Exactly what I was looking for
---
Are you on PC?
---
As have I, I believe most any NPCs can spawn as legendary
---
wait what level gives a monkey backpack :o
---
I've seen her before at this exact location. Also couldn't harm her at all. The only things she sold were a ton of chems.
---
Legit. Mount Blair is the most annoying one. Especially when you start the quest to restart the Rockhound and you're just about to start crafting the cores to power it up and bam. Someone comes along, contests it, kills ya and steals all your junk items
---
Do you hit lucky hole mine for lead? Also hitting west Tek for the guns and use scrapper to break them done for tons of steel?
---
Totally not mad. Just got the Halloween weapon paints for bushin it till the end of the match.
---
This is the most fun I’ve had in NW.
---
i mean the current one i use is a max level two star.  faster fire rate with explosive rounds.
---
Caves, Towers, various interior facilities, usually towards the back, top, or base.
---
Kinda just the game. There's farming methods for lead steel acid and cloth that help. But instead of stocking up per event I stock up for the play session for each day. Near the end of my session I craft all the ammo I'm probably going to use the next time I log in so that the next time I log in I'm ready to go everything. Also if your a commando maybe switch to rifleman it's way better on ammo.
---
Switch to melee or start using a gatling plasma or Gatling laser
---
Bethesda
---
What does that mission reward you with?  I started it earlier, but didn't want to finish it.
---
Try jumping server and see if you can do it again since you did t finish it due to not picking up what it had
---
You get the plans as a quest reward for doing the Settlers quests in the Wastelanders quest line. Even if you side with the raiders you can get them, just do everything you can for the Settlers before choosing a side.
---
Thats a hacked weapon in that case...cant have  faster firerate &amp; explosive on same weapon
---
Do you have the healing factor mutation? That gave me lots of fast travel issues.
---
Nice buddy, try using some food buffs like glowing steaks and mutant hounds to bump it up. I used an instigating dc for a long time before i got a b/ss meathook. Instigating effects on melees are honestly really underated
---
Isnt it a proximity mutation from the description? So if you arent near teammates dont you lose stats?
---
I agree that ghillie mod is really cool but I've resigned myself to never being able to get it. Perhaps I can buy it one day.
---
I have rifleman maxed, I think part of the issue is my weapons and load out for sure though. My strength is 1 so melee isn't an option. I just went with a high crit sneak build like I did in FO4.
---
As long as you're in a team (even one by yourself) you get +3
---
and there's no - effect
---
If I remember correctly (and I could be wrong haven't done it in so long) you get a fuck ton of black titanium and a ton of other minerals in the Rockhound's ore collector slot
---
Again tho I've not done it quite a while so forgive me if I'm wrong.
---
I have 12 mutations. I refuse to get rid of healing factor lol. It starts working when i holster my weapon if its drawn. Or if its not i draw it and holster it again and i can travel. But thanks for the thought.
---
Wow, amazing. So much details and the video composition is awesome!
---
I would do this, but then what happens next season? I've done this for games when I started playing halfway through a season and wanted to grab the remainder, but it can become a bad habit to do it every single season they release. You personally, are you gonna buy out each season they release?
---
No problems here, took [this](https://i.imgur.com/K7BkSKq.png) yesterday.
---
I’ve been using this mutation since the game been out. It has always been a good mutation. It’s just people are way too anti social in this game.
---
I have all the Halloween rewards now! Wooot! Just pushing through to get the fur lined jacket now.. its a grind and a half! This is great, I was too scared to play NW back when these events were happening so over the moon that I get a second chance now that I love NW
---
Once I complete today's dailies I'll unlock the stars wallpaper. I forget level number but I've not done anything for nuclear winter and completely changed my build from full health to bloodied after momma murma gave me a roll I had to use. Unyielding definitely makes a difference for failing xp I've noticed
---
Thx.  I really don't need that sort if stuff.  I only claim workshops to complete the dailies, tbh.
---
Wow that description of it is really misleading that's pretty good
---
It worked. Thanks!
---
quad cryo users are the real MVP of scorched earth,  we had a few runs where that kept her on the ground for a solid minute and a half and when she took off she had half her 2nd hp bar left
---
You bet
---
As it says I'm on PS4 but for design I'm not very knowledgeable on that topic. I guess I'll let the builder add their own touch to it. I'm open to new things !
---
Idk. It may come in handy some other point further down the line. Not sure what level you are but be warned, sometimes you may have to fend off a scorchbeast when defending the workshop
---
what a surprise!
---
The regular plan or one of the mods?
---
Ahh if there was cross play I would of helped happily
---
But leg day is amazing
---
Is it going to stay like that or are they gonna tweak it a bit when they realise people benefit from it solo in a public team?
---
There is no need for LONE WANDERER PERK now.. I Just use Herd Mentality Mutation and the perks that make your mutations stronger in a team and less negative effects.

I notice as soon as I make teams, ppl join.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I only make building teams for the +INT. (INT gives exp)
---
I imagine that might be your issue then. 
---
Well at least if it does eventually drive you insane you have a possible way to remedy it. For the record, I thought I'd miss it but I actually didn't (just saying :p)
---
Ah no problem bro it's all good 👍
---
I have almost 250lbs of plans, lol.
---
So if anything survives with like a smidgen of health left that means the game desynced, your client registered a hit, but the host server did not, the host server thinks you missed for whatever reason so it doesn’t kill the enemy. Doesn’t make it any less infuriating but that’s why, also if I recall correctly damage numbers are often inaccurate, for example you can’t headshot with melee attacks, even though the damage numbers will increase. This game makes it really hard to get to the bottom of how it works, so who knows if I even know what I’m talking about.
---
Use melee on routine mobs to save ammo for when you really need it.
---
If you have access to a private server, it makes things easier.. but you can do the steps below on a pub server also.
---
For steel, run Uranium Fever and try to tag anything that moves. Clear out every inch of the mine and pick up everything that isn't nailed down, inside and out.  Use the Scrapper perk and you'll net more than 1000 steel.  In 15 minutes max.
---
For Lead, Break out your excavator armor and hit the lucky hole mine.  If you grab all the ore, you will walk out with at least 800 lead in 20 minutes.
---
For Acid and more steel, claim the workshops at Disposal site HZ-21, Hemlock Holes and Grafton Steel.   You'll net about 60 acid and 90 steel every 22 minutes. 
---
Defend the workshop at Grafton Steel, it often spawns Anglers that carry Acid.
---
For Cloth, you can get tons and tons of that by collecting pre-war money from cash registers.  There are also a couple big stashes behind counters in the cabins at whitesprings.
---
Use Ammosmith and Super Duper when you craft the ammo.  You'll end up with more than you need.
---
Then that's a hard no.  I don't have ultra cite weapons and it takes too long when you only do half damage. . .
---
And in case anybody missed it.  Claiming workshops and defending them count as events.  And if you start a team, I think it counts as a group event, even if you're alone.

Like I said, I've never known about that test tool/site before. Also never knew what IP/address to ping, so I don't know what my times were before.
---
I'm on fixed LTE (basically like a smartphone hotspot), so it's not too bad, but it's not gigabit fiber either. If lots of people in my small town are online with Netflix or video meetings, my connection suffers, but usually it's decent.
---
When you farm ammo, don’t use weapons that you need ammo for. It is just a waste of resources really, use a melee or some other weapon. Also if you friends have any ammo you need , trade your ammo with them and maybe they have ammo you need, that is what me and my mates do all the time.
---
I literally got it because of the build im working with lol. Also ive had this mutations since a few weeks after the beta ended.
---
Exactly i had so many it was taking up space
---
This has been here since the game has been out. I’m surprised people just found this out. 
---
Pumpkin pie gives max hp as well.
---
Good thing Beth said they are gonna re-work the ammo machine.. cuz it does suck.
---
I don't think the engine is capable of it. It has to load the world before it can determine if any dynamic objects (i.e. CAMPs) conflict.
---
You also can't sell them at vendors least i can't they don't exist when in that menu
---
I don't know exactly what he did. I've told what I saw?
---
Better yet, the option to grab them by the stumpy scabby tail, and yeet the lil bastards over the horizon, or use them as a blunt object to whale on their friends.
---
Exactly for its price it should have some DR.
---
Just happened to me as well, 3 auto completed after crash on entering and relogging in. I guess it just works.
---
I need the super sledgehammer plans till there but gram is making this very dificult.
---
Debuffs like disease and rads? If so then thatll make end completely useless and bethesda could give it new perks 
---
*todd screaming ew work*
---
Or move some of the perks from the str tree into end
---
Is the SS underamor the best one now ? I use the protective marine wetsuit atm.
---
Or actually more like when the infinite carry weight with pocketed armor existed as well as infinite storage with the cannon. That would be more accurate.
---
I'm not sure of its English name, the dock bar, in a location near the airport in Morgan town
---
Nice thank you

Thanks you

It's set up for potential future DLC. You should be able to find a note that hints at this.

Once my alts learned all of my known plans, they were just dead weight.  I could try selling the slightly rare ones, but it’s easier just to dump them somewhere that they’ll be found and put to good use.

Presents. Someone opened some and then left the plans for other ppl.
---
Nice thank you so much
---
Mebbe after I afford some of the camp plans I want, the neon letters one ain't a quick purchase
---
Tomatoes grow on vines, mate.
---
When I get loaded down with extra plans I usually drop them all at once on a public server, just in case someone else can use them. Seems better than throwing them away. Looks like some other player did this and you found his throw aways.
---
Scorched porn shooting?
---
I've been a full health build since launch. Grinded and managed to barter for an anti armour handmade with explosive bullets and 25% less vats cost. Was never interested in bloodied but then I rolled a bloodied handmade with 25% less vats and 10% damage while aiming and I must say holy crap was I wrong for not wanting to try bloodied. The difference unyielding makes is incredibly noticeable, passing all the speach checks is easy and I'm dying in a queen battle no more than before but now I'm able to take out more spawns. Hell I only started changing perks on Friday night and already did an encrypted and still took a pylon while in nerd rage (than you carnivore and scorchbeast meat). So for my 2 cents not worth full health deck ready unless you just want to try something different.
---
They've been aware of the bug since at least March 2019 from the "support" I received the first time I lost out on Atoms. They will never fix it.
---
if you take the food factory workshop you can make sugar bombs also.  I think it is 4 every twelve minutes or something like that. I rarely ever seen anyone there any more (PC) though I presume that will change as Int builds become more popular
---
I find it just takes time for the atomic shop and legendary run to load in.
---
No reboot required but sometimes a minute or two minutes wait
---
Nope, just your intelligence, higher the better to increase the chance to unlock.
---
If you like melee weapons, use the flaming chainsaw (it sadly doesn't benefit from melee cards, I think anyways.)
---
If you die your flux doesn't drop anymore, it just disappears.  No one's stealing your flux.
---
**Try to use melee when farming.** Super Mutants are good to farm they drop gunpowder, ammo, caps, weapons. 
---
If you need adhesive to repair your weapons , set up a vegetable starch farm on your workshop
---
Well their fix to make him sit still at his desk actually made his wandering circle the whole map instead of just foundation!
---
Wrong sort though. It's the irradiated ones for cooking.
---
Ghoul slayers 25/25 broadsider
---
this is a great summary, thank you. I would be quite interested in seeing the melee version as well.
---
Fn seriously?
---
If you die it’s your fault not someone else’s. Take some responsibility for your action. Plus the flux is removed by Bethesda.
---
I'm trying tomorrow, if this works for me you are a freaking genius. Thank You.
---
Yes.
---
 Fucking game. Making me pissed at others. And nah.
---
oh dammiT!!! thanks for the info
---
&gt;who didn't want to see the game go to shit.
---
We missed the boat on that front.
---
I scrip them
---
well just dont die, I mean after lvl 50 at least for my experience you can take 4-6 hit from her till the danger of dying, I always tank her on melee to let gun people melt her.
---
No problem. I've just discovered that annoying fascnacht bot collects them. I guess he gets to stay for a bit after all lol.
---
LOGIC. Lagging others with explosives is totally not possible.
---
They were probably trading them to their alt account.  Did you take them?
---

---
It’s hard to say.   Everyone that is not melee will experience this.   Part of it is to adjust the the way you play.  You will need to mark acid for search as that will be the toughest resource to gather.   
---
If you do not know where these places are find them.    Lucky hole,   Him lock holes workshop,  grafton steel,  and westek.   
---
These places have the resources needed to make ammo.   When playing you need to grab and keep the lead, steel, and acid you come across.    You will likely need to plan farming a few days to stock up.   Once you get ahead of it you should find it easier to keep on top of it.
---
If you do not have super duper and ammosmith you need those cards ASAP.    
---
One last thing.   Check your build for optimizations.   As you remove quality of life perks and replace them with combat perks you will find your self doing more damage and thus using less ammo.
---
Best for max strength and endurance.
---
Read ingame note. Its clearly explain
---
A Furious/faster fire rate with speedy reciver Gatling gun with stabilized in power armor is an sniper rifle on auto.
---
Played 10 matches voted for Flatwoods each time, every match in Morgantown.
---
This is intended by the developers.  Why else would it be possible over two years since the release
---
You can't sell or trade any gold bullion items so that at least makes some sense.
---
Or scrap "Class Freak"
---
24 days is really not a lot.
---
Dude fuck that, I play video games for fun not for extra chores.
---
24 days for a random piece of gear? That’s to long almost a month
---
there are a few places that spawn multiple squirrel bits, for example priblos curios, toxic larry's, and one of the train stations -- thanks for the guidance!
---
Mmmmm boot taste good.
---
Yeah me and my mate took them all
---
There actually is a negative effect if you're solo, the problem is that it doesn't show up under your effects tab.  Even with class freak 3 it's -1 to stats.   Herd mentality has had this bug since beta.
---
I'm just a silly  Canadian lad and have no idea what im talking about, but I'm assuming you at least had crazy green giants running at you with miniature nukes during the festivities, right?
---
Nope. Been levelling up like crazy at events recently. I did line in the sand on my level 26 toon and walked away level 32.
---
The mini gun you get from becoming allies with the Raiders is very good for the Queen. It take a long time to get there.
---
I also have a Junkies Gatling that does very well.
---
What would you like to know about the item that shall not be mentioned?
---
how dare you! 
---
this game is perfect and high quality software, and most importantly it just works!
---
take your criticisms somewhere where people can't hear them!
---
I have infinite ammo with the Gatling gun. It’s a high dmg slow shooting weapon. The raiders ammo building gives me just as much ammo I use while I’m on doing stuff for the day.
---
because you touch yourself at night
---
Please tell me how to get the weapon I want. It's almost impossible to get a topweapon on PS4. No one will trade the best weapon to me for my rubbish. Bethesda set the drop rate too low. I can't make up for it by playing hard.And I know that there are many people who make use of bugs. Even without me, they will still dupe. However, I only focus on the facts I see. Unlike some people, they will only say "you are a cheater like him"
---
I did this yesterday. It didn't give me the SCORE on lvl 2, I'm guessing it's because I was still in the vault. Made my way to the Wayward and reached lvl 3 and it awarded the SCORE.
---
Damn that sucks, thanks for the info
---
Yea almost everytime I get on a team there all under 50 and wanna fallow me around but get mad it I dont wait for them to get shoots off but I'm sorry I'm  ot gonna wait for them to miss 5 shots with a hunting rifle before I can do anything
---
Wrong place to market stuff. This is against the rules to post this here
---
Pointless. No dmg = no tag
---
I clicked the wrong thread my bad
---
Strangler has the most rad resist if i recall correctly.
---
Morgantown is horrible for me, also had a 5 second pause while switching past aid in my pip boy
---
Happened to me fixed when I logged out and backed into private server.  Some one told me if you fast travel to your workshop it doesn’t actually charge you the fast travel cost but I relogged before I could try it
---
Is a two-shot variant of a Cryolator just as good?
---
I have all unyielding except right leg and my dr is 308
---
Just become allied with the settlers and you’ll get it.
---
Yes exactly this, and for all other crafting options such as cooking as well, when you get to late levels and you have a fairly beefed out stash and inventory, the server really stutters when you start making loads of things in a row
---
Food for thought but, the Strangler pa needs something more. The acid affect that gets out onto enemies last only 4s. Anything that isn't a radroach dosent even take damage lol &amp; you would think with having +50 acid damage that isn't negated by anything would rip. Nope. Not for this guy, getting the strangler is basically for looks imo.
---
I can but it costs tons of bullion. I think it’s like 4K or 5k for the whole set.
---
yea you can buy it once you are aliied with settlers ............for 4k bullion
---
Captainoob just solo'ed the Queen in 41 seconds with a bloodied fixer and no buffs.  Tyr did it in not much longer.   I suppose that qualifies.
---
Unarmed Melee is the strongest thing in the game though.
---
Armor workbench - craft- under armors - secret service under armor
---
Stats don't actually matter on power armor.
---
All power armor has invisible 7% damage reduction, and 15% radiation reduction on all pieces, meaning a full set of anything gives 42% damage reduction, and 90% radiation reduction before the stats are taken into effect.
---
Because of how damage reduction works in this game, there is a sort of soft cap where more defense is exponentially less useful. This point is determined by the damage of enemy attacks, which are weak af because players have very low health totals, meaning you don't need that much armor to reach that point, and need an obscenely huge amount of armor to make a big jump up from that point.
---
The rough gist of it is in damage : armor is as follows
---
- 1:1 =50% damage resistance
---
- 1:2 =61%
---
- 1:3 =65%
---
- 1:5 =72%
---
- 1:10 =78%
---
- 1:25 =85%
---
- 1:100 =91%
---
After you get past 3x the damage value of enemies more armor is so nebulous that you should not go out of your way to get more. To reach this point for the strongest attacks (175 glowing deathclaw heavy melee) in the game only takes ~500 armor. but what's more, all of those most powerful attacks (&gt;100) are melee type, meaning the blocker perk can reduce them by 45%, which reduces the amount of armor you need down to ~300
---
But here's the thing, that damage reduction from power armor lowers the damage value of attacks, pseudo increasing the value of the armor, meaning you only need ~180 armor (still only ~300 without blocker) to beat every attack in the game to the point you don't really need or gain more from armor unless you can start reaching into the thousands. 
---
A level 15 suit of raider power armor has 160 armor, meaning you can tank the toughest enemies in the game with it almost as well as the very best power armors available (with blocker), and enemies who are only plinking away for like 40 base damage with guns are an after thought.
---
Enemies that ignore armor entirely also do not care what power armor you wear.
---
Was wondering the same thing today. Have a nice red floor with two crappy spots
---
I really like my Berserker's Ultracite Gatling Lazer mainly for queen events (28 damage, 227 fire rate). It doesnt take out the queen super fast, as to not take the event away from other players trying to tag it (if you play multiplayer), and it holds its own against one on one bosses.
---
My team mares think so. 
---
Hell yeah, SBQ especially, but any worthwhile multi star legendary usually ends up looking white and moving slow.
---
I could picture that, haha
---
Ok thanks. 
---
Damn that is a lot of gold. Oh well, better than starting over.
---
when you get REALLY smart you start to hit the 4000 EXP cap, so if your is high enough to get event rewards above 2000 EXP without the event team bonus, then having the bonus becomes increasingly ineffective.
---
That's ok, completely your choice. Just don't be mad when a Chad wearing Captain Cosmos power armour comes, kicks sand in your face at the beach and steals your girl because you look weak and scrawny.
---
Well i'm a melee build; i know what i'm getting next.
---
Whew, yeah that's a lot of gold, but better than starting over.
---
Thanks
---
,0
---
Do they weigh anything? I havent claimed any yet.
---
3k to buy the suit, but don't bother with the helmet as it does nothing extra for the price. Instead use something like a Marine Tactical Helmet if you like the Gimp look, otherwise any headwear will do.
---
I've tried to word this in every way possible but I cant find a way that isnt going to result in a negative way. Me making this statement probably insights it. This is how I feel. I feel like no one talks about this information and when I rant about it I'm made to feel like a fool cuz all of a sudden this information is just common knowledge.  I feel like an idiot for not knowing and now that I've made this post embarrassed me . Literally everyone I've gamed with on 76 never told me that it disappeared and literally we all think that the toxic people were just letting the others die. That's why I try to revive everyone. I just want everyone to enjoy the game instead of fighting the queen for 15 minutes wasting 1000s of rounds on the SBQ to reap no reward. Not saying that the flux is a big reward in itself but this lack of knowing can really frustrate some people including myself. I make these posts to maybe insight some discussion but now I realize I'm an idiot for posting it the way I had. I get worked up and just say whatever. The book is over.
---
I'm already burnt out on this whole score thing. I just want to play the game and relax.
---
especially with strange in numbers, herd mentality, and empath
---
SOL for it to be free. It’s rep grind to allied then you need 4K just for the armor alone. Don’t really need the helmet but it’s another 1k iirc. That’s why I always tell people to do all side quests before you choose which side to ally with for the raid.
---
Never heard the set up behind berzerkers. Pretty interesting
---
Correct answer here.  The plans are near worthless now.  Snag them and don’t think twice about it.
---
This reminded me that Smiley still won't reset for me and now I'm sad
---
Why do the mods insta remove posts? I just wantt o ask about how to fix m VATs...
---
Public team is like private team except there’s a team bonus depending on the type of team chosen by whoever made it and the strength depends on the number of members. Also, public team members can’t mess with your CAMP. 
---
The blue bar is like a time delay on the bonus, so people don’t just jump into whichever team is convenient for a quick boost. When the bar fills, you get the full bonus of being a member. You’ve “bonded” with them.
---
Yes, the game and the servers are garbage
---
What level do you have to get into the raiders to get it?
---
You need to carry a melee weapon and at least two weapons that use different types of ammo. Use the weakest weapon that does the job.
---
I use Final Word and it always does enough damage to be able to loot it. Its an Anti Armor/25% faster fire/250 reloading resitance 50cal machine gun and you get that gun from completing Becketts ally quest. Its my go to and I love it
---
Taxes
---
I have dropped a few thousand plans in bags beside wayward. Opening presents gives you so many plans you already know, and they barely sell in my vendors. You will probably find bags containing different types of beer and other alcohol. Another byproduct.
---
Mutated team mates for strange in numbers is more important than finding the right team goal, most people are mutated so it's hard to find a team that isn't. 5% extra xp from food which is 2 1/2 INT equivalent, 1 extra point for herd mentality, 2 for egg head and 1 1/2 more for INT giving food. That's 3 more INT equivalent than playing with a full squad of unmutated players and can be done with just one other person.
---
Well yes but actually no. You won’t have 4 Tesla rifles in your face. But you can still have that one dickhead who’s “brave” enough to go toe to toe with a random. Like myself. But I also don’t use Tesla Rifles unless they’re already in play.
---
I gave up long ago on SBQ runs. I’m a bloodied melee. I want to alter the design, but it’s been months since I’ve seen a legendary weapon worth using.
---
comments like this are how you get bugs
---
Yeah when people contest a workshop I just server hop, no point in fighting
---
I totally get my change my mind part is noticing to degrade me but I do it to insight some sort of discussion.
---
Almost everyone things of bandwidth like... highway speeds.  In reality it's more like drainpipes.   The more bandwidth, the larger the pipe.  Fiber cannot move data faster than the speed of light, but yeah, if a lot of people are trying to throw data through the pipe, it will "slow" down as it waits in memory buffers for its turn.  Think of a crowded subway platform.
---
If it started to happen after the update, it could be the amount of processes being handled.  That is harder to diagnose.
---
Any other games having similar items?
---
Underarmor benefits differ. Some give +str, others +end. 
---
I know that raider is giving +per &amp; +agi, highest tier is shielded. For raider this benefits +3 agi, +3per, +1luck. Raider is suitable for a rifleman / stealth build like mine. Guess there is an underarmor for every kind of build.
---
If you looked around this has already been explained a 100 times. You did receive score but it was before you completed the challenge.
---
I've had it happen twice during Line in the Sand. For me it's just lasted maybe 10 minutes or so.
---
i'm 2500 into that hole myself.  really fucking demoralizing.
---
I decided to test if that was the case, it's not, my challenges still work even after having challenge menu open during reset.
---
People say caps are useless, but tons of people have ammo for sale for 1 cap each. Farm water or kill mole miners and sell the weapons for caps then buy your ammo.
---
Have you done Becketts Ally quest? If so I can tell you Final Word, the 50cal you get from completing it is very useful in SBQ events. Itll do enough damage to enable you to loot at least. Its all I use and I have zero perks enabled that would help it along. My 2 main weapons are a shotgun and lever action with perks helping both of those
---
yup once taken over they become that person’s property and still produce
---
They weigh .1 pound for me. I don't think any perk is effecting that.
---
Scorched **beast** porn shooting*
---
I really wish they just made respecing easier.  The problem with games as service is whenever game balance is addressed it can drastically change the viability of builds.
---
i’ve got them in my inventory but have never picked any up, so i’m guessing a bug or invisible loot
---
sometimes it works that way.  more often it won't load unless i do my reboots until it does load in.  i have the same issue with the news page.  it'll load without the pictures, they will not load no matter how long i sit there at it.  they'll only load right at first, or never.
---
How can I revive a player when I'm busy hiding in a bush.
---
I have an abundance of both of those. The only thing I want is the fixer plan and when I find it it’s usually for way more caps then I have.
---
I’m talking shit you find in a post apocalyptic world. Ammo you don’t use. I can’t turn round and sell that to a vendor. Plans I don’t need. I can’t turn round and sell those to a vendor. Most types of building material. I can’t sell that to a vendor unless I bulk it.
---
I think the point is you never have to be solo. Even if you start a new public team and you are the only person, the game still counts it as being a member of a team.
---
Have you looked at Camden park. That vendor sells excavator plans
---
Don't know if it matters but both times I was using a Tesla rifle on mobs that were dropping right on the platform.
---
The game tells you when you are going to exceed max.
---
I am specd to get crits really fast and I just blast her head with crit shots. I can do about 800-900 damage per shot
---
Yeah it never spawns for me I Alesha’s check their when I’m on but alas no luck
---
Lucky guy. My cores never sell. Full plasma is 19caps, and my fusion cores are down to 1cap / 3 charges. Still sitting in my vendor for days by now.
---
Of course nobody NEEDS to do anything in this game, but that doesn't mean they want to.
---
Some people grind for the ability to say look at my level (which I could care less about), others for some special weapon (which I also do not care about), others play to build things and earn atoms for their camp and make it look nice (which I care about), so each has their own reasons for doing what they do. On the more devils advocate side, I have seen countless posts on other site about people using god mode and leader bobbleheads to finish the game map already, so I am sure there will be plenty of them available for a price, eventually. 
---
The ammo converter is pointless, to me. I have it, have not built it, and could care less about it, but that is MY opinion and how I play the game, which is obviously different from you if you think it is a NECESSITY. I personally want to get to level 99 for that darn fireplace door. Why? Because I would love to use it in my bedroom for that warm cozy feeling and to free up the space the modern fireplace is currently using.
---
The one thing I do agree with is that no game is worth getting upset with or pulling your hair at over. I mean, its a game...it's not real, and means nothing in real life...whether level 50, 500, or 1050, its all the same. It should be fun and enjoyable, and if it is not any longer, then perhaps you should take a break or try a different game. I have done that before.
---
That's the point, don't tell me you expected it to be handed out to you as a quest reward right ?
---
It's the best armor, of course you need to put some little time to get it.
---
I agree with that assessment.  I was simply pointing out that there is in fact a negative effect of herd mentality when truly solo.  And that there's been a bug with it since beta that makes it not show on the effects tab.
---
When it doubt, just join or make a building team.  That gives 1int per full blue bar person.
---
So it gives extra exp no matter whatever you do.
---
I don't play many other games. I'm familiar with what bandwidth and throughput are like - your analogy is on target as I'm a firefighter and I understand flow through pipes/hoses very well. :) I do have to video-conference from time to time, and watch Netflix and other streaming services as well, and none of them have suffered. My general Internet service is also fine.
---
I'm currently getting pings in the low-20ms range on Speedtest.net, but the OP's FO76 Ping page is between 525 and 865 (I'm assuming that's also milliseconds).
---
that explains why it was up for peanuts on a vendor lol.  if memory serves, the guy selling it had a royal TON of stuff cheap, but me being a rather goofy and unfocused build didn't see a lot that was useful to me.  he had it up for 1k
---
woulda been helpful to have known what could or couldn't go together at the time but oh well.
---
I’ll go check here in this world and see
---
Oh okay. It might be because of my internet connection or something.
---
so keep the guy that have range safe from the little annoying mobs or get a long range weapon to keep doing damage to her, is the only solution man, I do what I can in the event to help, if I can't hit her I will kill the little annoying mobs, if I can I will tank her.
---
I get people contesting my workshops regularly because my alt is low level. I try fighting them on that character but 4/5 they overpower me. A Bloodied melee build designed to have a damage output in the 10000+ range isn’t for PvP. So I find someone on the server who’s not hiding offline, shoot them a message explaining the situation and ask them to stay on the server so I can bring out my main. Nine times out of ten they comply. Sometimes they even help me fight back. But I go to my BE laser yielding commando main and kick their asses.
---
Ironically I ran out of fusion cores because my jet pack wouldn’t turn off. Great.
---
Get a solid Gatling Gun, my BE Gun one hits almost anything, and is efficient enough that I’ll only expend what my Armco ammo machine makes during a play session
---
Damn wish it would do that for me with some.of the gauss wepaons
---
How long was the burst of 60 rads?
---
I had the same thing... Sort of. I wasn't in PA. I had just respawned but I was out of the nuke zone.
---
I see! Thanks for the info!
---
Just fyi almost all masks provide immunity to airborne disease, even if it doesn’t say so.
---
Like for 5 seconds
---
You have to become allies with them, which is the hugest level. It took me 6 weeks or so? I played a lot but I didn’t worry about being the most efficient I could be. 
---
It’s a long haul, but just play the game and do the dailies for both factions as part of your routine.
---
Like. I try to be part of the community, but I feel outcasted when I try to post something and especially if it's about toxicity I get negative feedback regardless if its blissful ignorance and I'm made to be toxic. I feel like this kind of mind set is bologna.
---
Melee builds sitting on the floor crying.
---
[removed]
---
I am in exactly the same position as you, more or less. There are lots of games I'd really rather be playing right now. Heck, I still haven't even finished Half Life Alyx (although that's partially just because I find VR kinda exhausting). I think I may just be done with FO76 for now. And that's even without completing Wastelanders. Which is a darn shame.
---
In truth, I don't mind that they need ways to monetize the game. The profit motive isn't a bad thing on it's own, and it's only reasonable that a company get paid for work it produces. ESO style paid expansions to pay for development costs alongside a much lighter-focused Atom shop to pay for server costs would be fine by me. Heck, even FO Shelter never got as onerous as this, from what I remember (although I haven't played much after the original version, so I'm not sure how annoying the missions get). That just required patience, which isn't so much a problem for me, and is otherwise just a silly little free base building game. As far as phone games go, it was pretty light on the whole money-squeezing mechanics. Even the Creation Club in FO4 I can stand (mostly because I have no real interest in it whatsoever). But what we have in 76 currently is just the Frankenstein's monster of psychological chicanery which is just kinda ruining the game. And that's just a darn shame.
---
I feel for you guys man
---
Maybe, but Bethesda do get interested when people find a way to steal Atoms. People who are doing this are not earning the Atom rewards and can buy items from the Atom shop.
---
my stats don't change. Ah wait. i just assume everyone has class freak 3 equipped. 
---
With class freak 3 there are no negative effects because it reduces the negative effects by 75% and that would leave 1/2 a stat point to take off. And it can't. So you get no negative effect.
---
Mine was about that long too. I panicked and ran north only to have it subside after a few seconds. That's when I checked that map and I was clearly outside of the nuke zone. 
---
So I assume it's a bug or lag. The game realizing there's a nuke so it should be irradiating you. Then it realizes your in armor or not in the zone.
---
I was playing in a private server the second time the reset bug hit me!
---
If you go to the food factory you can do the thing with home Defense and get a ton of armor pieces to help get their mods
---
Awesome, great advice! I was going to the fire station for lead and the mezzanine at the top of the world for Steel so this is really helpful.
---
Ok guys, dunno if this is allowed, but after reading all the posts: i sell all kind of high tier chems (disease cure 10, antibiotics 15, super stims 15, all combined drugs available, calmex, you name it), almost all ammo ( incl. 5.56, .308, 50cal., shells, cores), all kind of scrap incl. screws, adhesive, acid, circuits, crystal. Some instigating weapons too.
---
PC, EU, Name is: Miles234. Add me and visit my camp.
---
There's a quest? Yeah! I'll have to look into that.
---
I couldn't upvote this fast enough.
---
Yeah sounds like a idea
---
Legendary Ward asked me to track down his bone saw a couple weeks ago.
---
Perhaps harder to detect or better damage resistance and reduced ammo weight when work in a complete set, after all the secret service is suppose to be an elite security force.
---
WTF is a muffin button? Sounds like an euphemism for a sex act or large areolas
---
Nerp its happening to everyone actually.
---
i'm on ps4 and since update 20... all i can manage is about 20 mins before a crash.  utterly infuriating, especially with how daily locations will change if you don't lose the quest altogether.
---
the other day i was right on top of the raider thief for foundation, crashed, then had to go to the other side of the map for him once i got back in.
---
the ally daily for me, on the same day, just up and vanished.  only had to return home and talk to my ally, got a crash, and when i got back in i didn't have the quest, ally wouldn't give me a new one, and i was just out of luck.
---
ironically, the next day, after playing a little while i get messages about getting a weapon case and to return to my ally.  this was despite me not doing an ally daily yet, and the fact that the ally quest i lost was to murder a blood eagle, not retrieve a case.
---
Also, because this happens and needs to be said, make sure you bought the actual under armor and not just the shielded mod. You need both.
---
I've been using the "let's nuke" emote to let the NW team know that I either have the briefcase, or if they have it, that I have enough keycodes to launch!
---
jeez...a little sympathy wouldn't go amiss. everyone reacts in their own way. no need to ridicule

Sorry its jumbled, I was just listening them off the top of my head. Hope it helps
---
I currently have all five character slots filled with different toons, all over lvl 50. They all have their mutations, weapons, armor sets, and only 1 still needs to finish up their perks. IIRC four are over level 100 now.
---
That means my best option to level is my main character who sits around lvl 270, a heavy gunner who has the highest int. and runs full unyielding. I’m not going to delete the days and weeks of work I put into these characters just to cheese the SCORE system.
---
One of the vendors at whitesprings in the shopping mall always has it for me. One of the faction vendors.
---
Right! It's so annoying
---
Same here guys! Ps4. Update still hasn’t fixed this problem for me.
---
Well it's either that, or three different versions of the *exact same thing*, so what do you think?
---
Make sure you have the scrapper perk and grab all the weapons you can haul back to a workbench. Steel will no longer be a problem.
---
I also meant when you're truly solo, not a team of 1.  Was just trying to clarify that there can be negative effects from it in certain circumstances.
---
Does this work even if you have the carnivore mutation?
---
It would be nice to actually get what I'm working towards to, I've lost so much score to the daily reset bug, as have numerous other players that I've met on this subreddit and on Discord groups! But no that's too much to ask for and support keeps locking our cries for help!
---
It's a button that creates muffins
---
Could ya see it moving through appalachia drinking a nuka cola and eating a muffin. gotta taste better than radrat.
---
they really need to do something like having an actual auction house or some kind of a way to have your vendors being persistent.  or at least a safeguard where if a player is browsing a machine, the camp won't derez until they're out of the menu.
---
I do not know do you get zero benefit or less benefit from plants when you have the carnivore mutation
---
Because I'm a herbivore and I get 12% XP boost
---
Same here, that one and the workshop one both lost me 2000.
---
Use excavator armor to farm lead ore to get extra/ scrapper to gather steel from weapons and ammosmith &amp; super duper to craft ammo.
---
You are correct.
---
Yes it is not classified as meat or veggie, but only gives 5% 
---
Source:  just ate one
---
Relish for herbivores and canned meat stew for carnies.
---
Interesting, I’ll test it out. Thanks
---
Awesome thanks for the info
---
Yeah, looks like I'll be shelling out gold for it. Oh well, better than starting over.
---
And yeah, I'm kicking my own ass over not completing those side quests before the raid. Pretty dumb on my part, but I gotta deal with it.
---
Ah, I complete the daily and weekly then actually just continue and enjoy the game. If get to the end of the board, hooray! If not, well I'm not on their payroll . Besides, I have a feeling they'll do what Bungie did towards the end of a season and just sell the ranks or make a bundle out of it and throw it in the atom shop.
---
Thanks for tip on the helmet. I'll keep that in mind and save some gold.
---
I've been using my plasma caster the same way and it's pretty good. And my bloodied Gauss shotgun does like 16k I swapped to that today and ammo has been much better.
---
They were just added to the loot table recently. So there's a chance you got them as a reward.
---
Its what you need then. Thats 450 gold tho.
---
There are many perks and legendary effects that are really good at damage mitigation, to the point where something that might oneshot you ends up dealing 0 or 1-10 damage.  So you can survive effectively at like 20-30 hp.  Sometimes I run around with 14 hp and I can't die if I wanted to.  It's just a matter of balancing survivability with damage output at that point.
---
Yeah what level to get a monkey gonna be on my back?  86 .... Ufff...
---
Cranberry relish gives you 10% xp FYI.
---
I’ll do them but those 2 revives yesterday I had to kiss goodbye. Should just hopped on the mic and told my teammates to kill themselves
---
Near the end, so a hell of a lot of grinding!
---
It was there in my world but I’m the dumb one. I didn’t read all your post that you’re on x box. I’m on psn.  Sorry. Good luck.
---
Woah I never knew that, I’m only like 78 because I just can’t bring myself to grind 2 hours for a level
---
I do a serrated electrified Chinese officer sword, a fully moded level 5 .38 pipe rifle to eat up all the 38 they will get,  however much purified water I have, a treated/sheilded vault suit (whichever one is the max, I always get them confused), and however much treated deep pocketed leather armor I can make them. It's not great, but its normally better than nothing. I also like to do a melee and ranged weapon because you never know what kind of build they want. If they are a little higher level, I'll try to match the gear to their level.
---
Is pvp really an option if you want to play this game long term? For many, pvp is the only reason they still play this game after finishing the story and they will undoubtedly grind for the legendary perks. I don't know why you're so pissed when I'm just trying to give the argument that it could be taken as pay to win.
---
Try camping someplace other than Whitespring.
---
So you can get them out of your inventory and lose out on scrip.
---
As I said, I was afk. Maybe you missed that. So "fair warning" was not a thing, as I was away from keys, therefore I could not receive it. But thanks for keeping your reply from sounding negative...
---
I'm also hearing reports of it affecting people who login 15 minutes after the reset and it still happening.
---
I’ve never seen someone who ever lost score. I’ve always seen ppl complain about losing score where in reality they did get the score but didn’t see that they receive the the score when they hit 3/5 progress or so.
---
If they are worried it’s not hard to do the math and it always adds up to the amount you would have received.
---
It’s alright
---
Just under The Crater. Nothing to farm at that place if you know it.   
---
As I said,  Do you know the campsite that has lead and junk? Yeah, that is where I have my mains camp. I can't think of any legit reason someone would have to nuking that one spot. Thank you for your question.
---
Ah, okay. Thank you!
---
Most stuff, I sell low. Plans 5-10, Ammo 1, even some clothing I put in for 10 caps. I've dropped DCs to 20 too. They usually sell well. If they stop, I drop.
---
There’s a datamined repeatable for doing events as well, so this makes what Bethesda said about earning score with xp or events true.   If the xp one doesn’t line up with double xp weekend then it’ll be tough for me personally (lost about 2k) but doable.
---
Thanks for the heads up! \^\^
---
I’ve been playing since launch and rarely PvP anymore.  It got boring very fast once I had the gear I needed. 
---
I’m not ‘pissed’ at all. I just think it’s hilarious to believe that there is a ‘competitive win condition’ in this game. 
---
And therefore the entire concept of ‘pay-to-win’ is ludicrous. 
---
If my opposing opinion bothers you, that’s unfortunate.
---
I haven't played the game in six months but I can tell you the Nuclear Winter daily challenges always had issues with completing themselves.
---
"If you missed that" yeah it says in the post I was afk, so yeah I missed it, not sure why you are not aware of that if you took the time to reply. Also, "griefing" is a well-known term you can research if you care to learn before making a false claim that something that is, is not.
---
Like this?

&gt;Also, "griefing" is a well-known term you can research if you care to learn before making a false claim that something that is, is not.
---
Doesn’t appear so, no. Rather, if they do, there isn’t any real feedback on the matter and it is still fairly consistent in matches, so... yeah, doesn’t seem to be anything.
---
Because pvp is shoe horned into this game terribly badly.. I have no issues with NW but adding a zone on the world map like the dark zone would be bad as the loot would obviously be far above every where else, as per the dark zone, pve people wouldn't use it but it still annoys you when you know its in there and you can't access it because of toxics..
---
I disagree griefers are the worst type on online human that exists, people throwing threats at me is meaningless.
---
I have a fair stockpile and know most of the junk farming locations for when I run out of something. So... I don't think I will be too lost.
---
Thank goodness for this. With all the intimidating posts here, it seems to me that missing the entire first week would leave me more than screwed.
---
Well, as I said i was afk. So I can assume from the time I was gone to the time I returned.... I was sitting in my bathroom when the warning came up.
---
It's because it is a subscription. Miscrosift is going to want a back up option so it can charge you for the next month. I assume that it would use your payment option on file to charge you for the next month if your Microsoft wallet is empty. You could sign up, then go to your Xbox account-Manage Subscription and cancel immediately to prevent the next charge. You can then sign back up and repeat the process when your month expires. That will help prevent you for being auto charged the next month.
---
There are none though. My special stats don't go down. i explained how it cannot go down. I gain plus 3 when i join a party and when i'm not i lose that 3 so i'm just back to normal
---
A couple of times the game bugged when i logged off and i was seeing my challenges while in the main menu. I still dream of that day.
---
No. It's just under The Crater.  Do you know the campsite that has lead and junk? Yeah, that is where I have my mains camp. I can't think of any legit reason someone would have to nuking that one spot.
---
THIS IS MADESS.
---
Wait, you mean see how much xp is needed for the next level? Nope can't do it. Too much work.
---
Yes I can and will definitely try to incorporate more whining in to my future replies.  Thank you for your input.
---
Not sure how it would or could be permanent in any way seeing that it's not preprogrammed into the game... But thank you for the reply.
---
The cats? ATOM CATS RULE!
---
When I am truly solo even with class freak rank 3 I lose 1 special in every category.  And 85% of the time the herd mentality mutation at -1 doesn't show up on the effects panel.
---
I don't really care, Bethesda can do what they want. I'm just trying to say it would be really dumb for Bethesda to make something that would let them 'win' their artificial endgame faster would be dumb, because half the time the community shits itself when something like the lunchbox comes into existence.  You could even argue it's already pay to win if I'm being honest. There's also the fact that the pvp community is already at war with Bethesda and will pretty much use anything as ammo
---
I'm on Xbox :( thank you though, I really wish I had more in game friends tbh so I appreciate the offer
---
Ah was thinking of a different double spot. Sorry matey that ya camp got nukes but it is part of the game unless you live in the safe zone.
---
Tato Granade throable, gives a debuff called "shamed" that lasts 15 or 30 seconds, and has no real effect except you have tato on your character. Also a Snowball one for the winter event, eso has similar throw able emotes, and consumables.
---
Sorry, but high schoolers actually play videogames.
---
Especially with having daily nuclear winter challenges. It would be nice to not have to load into adventure mode to check the challenges just to leave the server and then join a nw server if I'm gonna do that daily
---
it's buggy af. the 4 toons I did the raiders side with never made it through without bugs. you need to quit to desktop and start from the beginning of the raid. if you don't skip any dialogue it seems to help sometimes. my main toon took 7 restarts to get through the quest.
---
Agreed my point exactly, either Bethesda will do banning or not, nothing we can do about it, just play the game as intended and worry less about others breaking the rules imo, at least until it physically affects others.
---
Says the people wasting ammo instead of letting her land. You’re not going to get through to them. They’ve likely already been kicked out of a discord or two.
---
Yet i pay the subscription through that method without any problems. I was/still am able to pay it (Switched it to a Yearly subscription yesterday) everytime. I personally didn't have to select the option to use a 'Backup Payment', so i don't understand why it would ask her to do so even though it didn't ask me.
---
keep quiet, this is the one bug we don't want fixed
---
Like 6v6 or 4v4 Golden Eye style!
---
And he never will.
---
From reading i'd suggest plasma its way more damage if you don't mind the goo puddles, seems to upset some people those, also goo puddles give nuclear waste as a bonus.
---
You do know bows are shocking inaccurate right?
---
Vegetables just dont satisfy hunger. As far as I know you still get any buffs the food may have though
---
Thank you for the tip, I will try it and see if it works. Thank you.
---
yep those are def my fav weapons for DPS. Harpoon gun is GREAT for ammo conservation when you’re just doing dailies and shit
---
You have one of the items he's looking for in your inventory (Misc), drop it, sell it to another player or stash it.
---
I'm sure to Hairy Wagstaff, everything sounds like a euphemism 🤷‍♂️
---
 "I can't think of any reason to give money to help support a game that punishes you for getting griefed by other players. "  
---
"It's not that I got griefed that is the problem, it's that I have to pay for getting griefed." "...I have to pay supplies to repair my entire camp... "  
---
I can understand how you might get confused.   
---
So I will try to be more clear. I see no reason to give money to help support a game that punishes you by making you pay for other players griefing actions.
---
Yes you can
---
Also check out my camp, it may not have anything for sale but if you see me on then invite me to a public team my gt is GetShrekedOnBud
---
nope, you can do dailies for both and can get both sides up to max relationship
---
A bunch of Cranberry bushes can be found at Aaronholt Farm. Head to the right from the fast travel point toward the silos and theyre in the field there
---
You can grind both factions to max reputation regardless how you ended the story portion.
---
Its the helmet that makes the sounds yeah? Have you tried unequipping it? I've been hearing other peoples suits go off, unless its a bug on the client for the person wearing it and everyone else can still hear it?
---
 Also, "griefing" is a well-known term you can research if you care to learn before making a false claim that something that is, is not.
---
I'm well aware, been using a bow for a while. I just enjoy the challenge and the audio feedback on it is super satisfying
---
No they didn’t. The people who said it’s not possible had very poor math beginning with the fact they overcalculated total score by 3,500
---
Yea the vault doesn’t count.
---
You used to get a missile silo tape as part of the quest to launch a nuke.  You can buy one in enclave wing.
---
It tells you the status of the 3 nuke silos.
---
As long as I get the Giant Sheepsquash Plushie I am set.
---
What platform?
---
If you have access to private worlds, its definitely worth doing it on there, I did all of my instanced stuff on private and never ran into any of the bugs people mention here, my guess is they are lag related. If you or a friend has 1st, use private and hopefully it will go through without a hitch.
---
You didn't get griefed.
---
Thanks I wasn't sure because I was told you can only choose one side and the other will be hostile but it's good to know that I can still get rep for them
---
I’ll give it a shot when I get back to my base. :/
---
If they are jumping every 2 seconds they should be pretty easy to spot?
---
Well, my name IS a dick joke...
---
Written as a rant, huh?
---
You have to activate all 3 pylons, then the boss gets vulnerable. Yeah I know, mechanics, urgh.
---
U on pc? I have like 4-5 fixer plans. Could spare one.
---
I was a bow build and out of experience the explosive arriws are the best
---
You can unequip and reequip power armour pieces straight from your pipboy aslong as you're wearing the frame
---
lol
---
Don't jump, don't hide in bushes, don't hide in trees, don't hide in water, don't team-fill, team fill and revive two players, don't do this, don't do that, do this, blah blah blah..
---
No matter what anyone does, someone will be butthurt and make a damn reddit post about it.  
---
Maybe just get good at shooting moving targets, and stop complaining?
---
dont afk in nuke zones yo.. thats on you
---
I don’t care about all of that. This was a debate over the ***term***. That’s it.
---
Oh, I thought the screens in that part is of the bunker told you what was ready
---
I've been experiencing the hard freezes or the game crashes back to my home screen.
---
U Wot M8? I could believe that at level 100 only 15k XP were required, but now I'm nearly level 600 and doing a repeatable 10k XP challenge adds roughly 10% to my XP bar, which means I need \~100k XP to get just one level. And it shows, takes me a good hour of pure grinding to get 1 level. And it didn't get this slow overnight, leveling was slowing down gradually, so there's definitely a steady growth.
---
This.   
---
"Missile Silo State Holotape"  
---
It will tell you which silos are currently on cooldown (3 hour cooldown after launch). If Either Alpha, Bravo or Charlie have 0h 0m remaining, then you can launch from there.
---
Got 2 this weekend.
---
Do you use flechettes mod with yours? I have a great one but I am trying to get proficient with it. Right now I am all over the place.
---
That's exactly where I get them bro
---
Thanks for the luck, I dont have 1st, nor do i have any friends that play f76 so I will try the restart over and over for a few tries and see if it works.
---
Just a visual glitch i had it happen too. I was never charged i am at max caps i would have noticed.
---
well that is odd as i don't. maybe you had a 1/2 point that should have been taken off somewhere and it's added up
---
You willing to trade?  I got a bloodied plasma rifle I could trade.
---
Does it stack with tasty squirrel stew?
---
10000 xp for 100 score points tho is still a ton of farming
---
Yeah, why not. Will be online in about 2h by now.
---
I guess it's possible, I will experiment and check again.  But everytime I log in I'm -1 in all stats until I join a team.
---
That I tried already, thought you meant maybe the skin itself
---
If you're on PC I am happy to let you use my private world, my ingame name is NukeJockey, feel free to add me if you like, just let me know your username as social menu is buggy af.
---
It makes sense from a realism perspective, a lot of rotary guns share ammo types with rifles, and if you have a military industrial complex generating ammo it's not gonna be an issue (Cue the Heavy talking about the cost of firing his gun, I guess?).
---
Game balance wise it's a bit of a nightmare to counter resource scarcity, weapon viability and player enjoyment of the relevant item.
---
This is a normal team thing.
---
You have to get allied with them, so you do the vault run and a daily quest for a couple weeks to be able to buy it. It’s the gauss mini gun which is my favorite. But this all depends on your build, the gauss mini would be for a heavy gunner build
---
I know what griefing is. That’s not it. Anyone can launch a nuke anywhere in the areas that’s allowed in game. It’s an intended mechanic of the game. 
---
P.s. This is the wasteland. Not your grannies house. 
---
Junk is everywhere and free, and not to mention you having first you should have plenty stocked by now. 
---
Also remove that raider tag while you’re at it.
---
Is it considering stealing when it’s your own IP?
---
Cool idea, an upvote for you sir or madam.
---
I wish mine wasn’t level 25🤦🏻‍♂️
---
That'd be the next thing I guess, I'd remove the skin, equip the helm, then remove it and add the skin, then reequip.
---
The debuffs from hunger and thirst presumably, like reduced AP etc
---
nah.. Ive been playing on and off all day too.. just logged off my 4th session today
---
no issues like that at all
---
Compromise would be the gold bullion-locked weapons all share the drum, OG rifle still takes the 2mm EC
---
Those screens tell you MODUS's progress on decrypting the launch codes (which you don't even need, since there's a website that lists them all).
---
Robot and marine to round out the set.
---
Because trapper and raider will be next time!
---
Angry turtle has good videos about this. Piercing is useless unless you have no other options. Use perforating for the highest armor pen or use swift for the lowest VATS cost. Basically, piercing does less armor penetration with a smaller mag size and higher VATS cost.
---
But what about my Stalker's Rolling Pin? I need a vomit recolour pronto!
---
Golden Eye was the shit.  RC-P90!
---
oof. Keep your eye out on player vendors. You might be able to get a higher level one from one. Even at lvl 25 though itll still be probably useful enough til then
---
Don’t feel bad, I gave away 12 legacies a couple weeks ago and pretty much my entire stash. Felt good to give the stuff away to people who could use them.
---
Survival no longer exists.
---
What items
---
there should be a shoe shine box..
---
That protectron looks awesome. Good job
---
A vaping hipster emote
---
On top of this post PLEASE don’t shoot her in the air. Sometimes it helps keep her airborn due to a bug / staggering. I ask this because melee players can’t do shit in this instance and takes a lot of fun out of the event. Plus majority of people don’t have good enough guns to be doing any kinda of meaningful damage to her while she flies so it’s a piss off and a huge waste of ammo. Thanks in advance
---
People that can't spell the event name make me go crazy!
---
ENCRYPTID***
---
It's a damn pun and everyone that butchers it here is ruining it.
---
There are 5 specific things you have to build,
---
I font remember off the top of my head but check the submenu to see what they are
---
i press start and right on my d-pad
---
when you open your map is there nothing in the top right?
---
or is pressing a button to view your map too tedious?
---
This is why we need the PipBoy phone app updated to Fallout 76 🤞
---
I don't know of a hotkey, but you can access challenges from your map, so thats one keypress and then a mouseclick, not as bad as navigating to them through the main menu, but still not perfect.
---
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSS
---
FOMO is a big reason I quit Destiny 2, especially because after paying $100 for the game and Season Pass (the one for actual DLC content) I was turned into a F2P player, and they locked content and gameplay behind Season Passes. There was no point in playing the game unless you paid them every 3 months.
---
You need the blue asylum dress
---
Very nice thanks for sharing.
---
Serious question. So if say I’m out killing shit and doing events like crazy I’ll get more xp from the Int boost with 3 bonds than I will from event boost with 3 bonds? Or is building the way to go?
---
I’d rather be in a match with jumping bots than aim bots.
---
I started the day with 507 and ended it with 507.
---
Those defence events are partly good, but they're also not really communicated well to other players other than the workshop owner. That and sometimes the workshop attacking enemies are just annoying molerats with terribly slow spawns. If it was anything more like Line in the Sand or Guided Meditation spawns + putting a marker over all the attacking spawns then farming those workshop defence events would be so much better. As is they're sorely lacking and a large majority of the playerbase still avoids workshops like the plague because of the ability for players to kill them, even if they can't if they aren't the owner of the shop anymore.
---
\#1 Its not guaranteed that we have the same 10k XP weekly challenge in the coming weeks (and on Double XP weekend).
---
\#2 Don't do "Event Teams" on Double XP weekend, because XP is capped at 4000 XP which you can easily achieve without the team bonus.
---
\#3 "Builder Teams" are nice for the extra INT, but more important is having another player with mutations as "Strange in Numbers" perk gives extra +2 INT from Egg Head, +1 INT from Herd Mentality, +1 INT from Brain Fungus Soup and +5% XP from Cranberry Relish (with Herbivore).
---
\#4 Carnivores can use Tasty Squirrel Stew (+20/25% XP) and Broiled Scorchbeast Brain (+6/7.5 INT) as alternative foods (but these are harder to farm).
---
\#5 Don't use your Lunchboxes all at once. Yes they stack up to 100%, but if you use one it refreshes the duration of the buff. So just wait until the duration is almost over and then use the next one. So instead of having +100% XP for 1 hour, you will have +25% XP for one hour, +50% XP for another hour, +75% XP for another hour and +100% XP for another hour. Not sure if you can continue freshing the duration by using a fifth lunchbox.
---
\#5 XP buffs: Well Rested / Lover's Embrace (+5% XP), Mothman Lighttower Event (+5% XP), Cranberry Relish / Tasty squirrel stew (+25% XP), Inspirational perk (+15% XP), Leader bobblehead (+5% XP, use Curator perk to extend duration), Live &amp; Love 8 magazine (+5% XP, use Curator perk to extend duration)
---
\#6 INT buffs: Casual Underarmor with Shielded Lining (+3 INT, if you don't have this use your Vault Suit with Shielded Lining for +2 INT), Night Person perk (+3 INT), Egg Head mutation (+8 INT), Herd Mentality mutation (+3 INT), Broiled scorchbeast brain / Brain bomb (+7.5 INT), Berry Mentats (+5 INT, use Chem Fiend perk / BioCommMesh armor mod to extend duration), Unyielding armor piece (+3 INT, armor can have another +1 INT as secondary bonus)
---
Stupendous post.  Really agree here, the whole situation just \*sucks\* to be a serious fan of the series with any sort of time investment in this game
---
It’s 20 Super Mutants if you stack a few XP buffs.
---
Not since patch 20.  Herb/carn now double the buffs as well.  And cancel out other. So carn can’t eat relish for buff anymore
---
Plasma.
---
Doesn't attract absolutely everything in the vicinity.  More damage.  No splash damage (if you are using instigating, that is important).  Leaves a big pile of fluorescent green goo so you can find what you killed.
---
Does not seem to be effected by Well Grounded mutation (energy damage reduction).
---
Tried both on all three bows (bow, compound bow, and crossbow).
---
When I did the raid with the settlers I had to restart because the guy wouldn’t open the door after the tunnel. It happened on numerous quests when wastelanders launched it was so annoying
---
Godmode. But your SCORE won’t increase. So there’s that.
---
The first thing I thought of was that episode of parks and rec where Ron gets a really good shoe shine! 🤣
---
Unfortunately I have an issue with "modified game files" and as such, can't play NW, don't care enough for the mode to sort out the issue (could be the mods I'm using for adventure mode, an inventory management one and a perk loadout one), if thats the case then I'll never bother fixing it. Just means I have to throw some time into west tek runs, but 30k xp isn't that hard to gain, the extra NW stuff on top of that would be nice though, I'd be rank 23 instead of 22 now.
---

Cranberry cobbler (10% xp) cranberry juice (4% xp) brain fungus soup (4 int = 8% xp) and cranberry relish which is 20% extra xp
---
Please delete this post. Nothing to see here.
---
Yep yep, it’s insane man. It’s only actually effective in vats but you get more harpoons back than what you shot. I’ve got a junkies flachette harpoon gun and can one shot any of the normal max level mobs. It’s great
---
Autocorrect happens man. Encrypted is a word, Encryptid is not.
---
What is that
---
Lmao I’ll fulfill your request
---
Ok my psn is Whaslett_1 if you want to add me
---
Were you running with the demolitions perk?  I found Plasma does slightly more damage, all things being equal.  Didn't try the demo perk, but I imagine that would help the explosive arrows.
---
Launching directly from the launcher or the icon? My partner had an issue where it was asking for her login when using the desktop icon, simply launching it from the actual bethesda launcher would solve the problem. No idea if its related to your problem though, have you tried reinstalling the launcher? Assuming you can just have it discover your game files again so you don't have to download the entire game again.
---
Plant gourds at your camp. Save up sugar. Cranberry Relish is even better. 
---
If you’re a carnivore, go for Squirrel Stew instead. It’s a lot more XP buff.
---
Join or create a building team for +1 Int and therefore +2% XP per bond. 
---
Get Herd Mentality and enjoy a +2 Int all the tine as long as you’re in a team, or a Public Team of one.
---
Oh yeah hitting right on the keyboard works thanks
---
Thanks. Works on pc too
---
On the map you can hit the right arrow and it works, turns out.
---
if your on pc i sell all of them at 440 each. based my price on how much i could get at a vendor for them and then  charge less. ign ZedNott if you see me on ur server.
---
Ok what level? I may be able to give extra
---
Autocorrect is a system that can be user fixed.  It is laziness on part of said users to not fix it before posting.  Be smarter than the tool you use and all.
---
That's a really nice paint job, and please don't take this the wrong way, but those figurines look like ass. I've seen better stuff on Thingiverse.

 tldr: a unbalanced game system making a ton of ppl one build only
---
You need food or any water?
---
Food
---
Yes, but not like that. It’s not additive. They’re multiplicative. 
---
If you have all three at +20%, it’s actually x1.2 x1.2 x1.2, or 1.728. In other words, it ends up being +72.8%. 
---
Same with the other damage/weapon class cards. And don’t forget Bloody Mess for another x1.15 added in.
---
Gauss minigun then dupe some magazines. Enjoy and you can kill her in a second or two lol
---
Are you being sarcastic?
---
No i wasn't
---
You dont need to give me any if you dont want to
---
Ok i’ll make you food right now while im adding you
---
Sweet as, learn something new every day.
---
I have a farm in my camp lol im more than happy to give
---
Way too much trouble to do that. 
---
Simple solution: Make all camp plans account wide. Period.
---
Ok
---
These are Legendaries with the Explosive prefix.
---
It isnt ammo, it’s a secondary perk on a legendary gun. For example: I have a TSE handmade. (Two-shot, explosive) You can get the explosive pre-fix on almost any weapon. Excluding any weapon that explodes by nature and energy weapons. Energy weapons still have the effect, but can no longer be obtained from an enemy. It has to be traded from player to player.
---
This is such an easy thing to implement. All the design and code is there. They'd have more time to refine if they didn't half ass everything.
---
If you’re on Xbox I can give you a plan
---
The miniatures from the tabletop game Fallout Wasteland Warfare are pretty good.
---
Thank you
---
I just scripped it, this was months ago and I’m level 165 now lol. The .50 cals are my favorite weapons in the game, I found a bloodied one that is my go to weapon for everything
---
Things like Lock Pick, Hacker, Green Thumb.  Those types of cards.   While important for there tasks, they take up points that can be used for increased damage or resistance.  Once you are through the main story you wont need them as much and can swap them in as needed.
---
There pretty common it's only a major roll it just depends on the weapon its on that makes it good and its prefix bloodied and junkies being the best two but do some 2 star legendary rolls at the purveyor with 1000 scip and ur bound to get something explosive eventually 👍
---
I was thinking more along the lines of goodfellas..
---
Well, no, because events already do tell you how long they've been active for and people don't normally do that.
---
I did exactly what you were doing when I first started.  I learned better ways from smart people here and on youtube.  The weights are still a nice supplement, as are tin can chimes, but  the steps above net you a lot more.
---
Note: The event "Line in the sand" also is a great one for steel.  Again, use the scrapper perk.  Since you won't be able to fast travel with all the weapons you pick up, the entrance to the Big Bend Tunnel (east) has workbenches to scrap all of it.  Takes 2 minutes to walk there.
---
The wallset did, I made the mistake of getting it first thinking I could get the porch, but that part hasn't left the bundle yet.
---
That's not what people are complaining about. People are, mostly, complaining about a different bug where their daily challenges are already completed when they log in.
---
They did not complete them through play, and the score total hasn't advanced due to their completion. Those players are effectively locked out of those dailies, and miss out on the associated score points.
---
This is what people mean when they say they've "lost score".
---
&gt; I’ve never seen someone who ever lost score.
---
Pay closer attention in future.
---
I see you have our missing property.  I hope you know how to work a water cooled bone saw.
---
what if you dont want anyone to join your team?
---
that would probably be a good tell for that...
---
me too, or menu, challanges, mouseover daily.
---
I do wish the Pip Boy app worked for 76. I used it religiously in 4, it was so damn cool. It also help with checking my special stats during conversations, things like that. 
---
I get it would be an advantage against others, sorta but....I mean it’s your *pip boy....* it’s the favorite menu, just with everything else too lmao.
---
That bodes... well? Hopefully, it'll pop up in the future. I wish they'd just put everything in the shop, and just rotate sales.
---
I'm honestly with you on that. They remind me of army men, very strange
---
Here in Appalachia we got spiders, ants and slugs.
---
Ah Ok, thanks for the updated info. I wasnt aware
---
Haha nice! And also a pen skin for the switch blade!
---
On the contrary, it's fun to troll bloodied builds with this.
---
Cool.  Streaming services use designated ports, which networks will use to dedicate priority on what goes forward, etc. because they are the most susceptible to jitter, etc.  Video games are "as needed" due to processing is taking place on both sides of the connection and only updates are transmitted. Still a lot of data, just not prioritized. 
---
If you have two or more friends, and you care enough, from different locations around the state/country, run simultaneous ping tests and compare peak delay times.   If they are are consistently similar at the same time, thre delays are most likely at the game servers side.  If not, it could be provider issues anywhere along the path.
---
Its the first place Ive been heading too when i start a session now lol
---
What about the trolls? can they keep using it?
---
Et for atari. almost as bad as fo76
---
This is pretty good advice.  If you are running low, ammo at 1 cap is a steal.
---
Yeah thats a little too many key presses lol.
---
Np
---
Exactly
---
If you go to the tinker work bench, they should be at the very bottom under ultracite ammo
---
Thanks, very insightful.
---
Where do I get that?
---
Trade for them, I traded something like 5k regular 2mm ec for I think 150 crimson flux.
---
a douchebag emote?
---
I've got plenty of scrip so I'll do that. Any reason to do 2 star rolls and not 3 start?
---
Idk thats a big jump lol
---
wouldn't it be more efficient to make cranberry cobbler instead of relish? sure relish lasts longer but requires much more ingredients and that time spent gathering more than cranberries and wood could be used getting more xp
---
I assume it has a prime receiver on it, as standard Ultracite gatling lasers still only use standard cores. Did you install the prime receiver yourself? If so, you should have an option for ultracite ammo at a tinkerers bench, if not, you need to learn the receiver plan which in turn lets you make the ultracite cores.
---
You should be able to craft them already at a tinker bench
---
Interesting ... two players ... two sets of different results.  Gotta be something different, Perk Points, Perk Cards, something.
---
Anyway .... both are okay.  Explosive is loud and wakes/attracts all baddies in the area, which makes the slow draw and fire rate of the bow a bit more challenging, which might be more fun.
---
much like FO76.. ET is really a pretty good game if you know how to play it..
---
the problem with ET was that they produced more copies of the game than there were 2600s in the world.. it actually sold OK.. 
---
everyone I knew had a 2600 when I was a kid and everyone had ET
---
For me its not just visual,i pay, the workshop icon is gone and i tried again and again.
---
Join me?
---
misses dont break the increase unless you hit another target
---
I had one before I found a Quad. The two-shot is great, since you can freeze the Queen with fewer shots (assuming they all hit). I found I had to get closer with that version, but it's still a great Queen weapon.
---
I believe you need the plan for the Ultracite Gatling Laser to be able to craft them.  They drop rarely from bog events, especially Census Violence.  You could also get the prime plan from the SBQ.
---
It shows your offline even though you aren't
---
Nice! There is technically one refinement I can suggest on top of this, though it’s best saved for the double weekend - brain bombs. With herb, they give 6 extra int. In addition, strange in numbers affects both herb and egg head to boost int even further.
---
Ok i’ll join after my trade :)
---
Yes but you have to gather wood 100 times, not gather 100 wood total. I went sylvie and sons, pricket fort then the logging place south of vault 76 to get my 100.
---
All power armours should have set bonuses, it would also make it easier to add new power armours without the need to just make it better stat wise.
---
I personally think the Chinese PA skin and Hellfire from the BR should have been new suits not skins.
---
There's nothing special about using AWS for that.
---
The damage validation system is the only reasonable culprit.
---
If the damage validation system can't properly run on the hardware it was intended to run on, that's still Bethesda's responsibility.
---
Argh.  I spawned in NW with that rainbow crap on and couldn't get it off until the next round. It isn't great for stealth lol.
---
There was Fallen Earth, which is offline now.
---
Defiance is quite fun, but not a good game imo, still I put quite some time in it before, when the show was on.
---
I don't there are a lot of tps/fps rpgs tbh.
---
What did the curtains and wallpapers cost you? May I suggest requesting a refund from bethesda for the cost of them so you can purchase the bundle without losing out? That way you can get the porch now without essentially paying for some items twice.
---
Cryo doesn't really do much.  It has a miniscule slowing effect, that lasts 3 seconds, so you can't stack it with another shot, as the reload and fire rate of the bow is so slow.
---
Tried it with a Quad Crossbow, which did manage to freeze something (can't remember what) but by the time I reloaded it or switched to something with some actual power, the effect had warn off.
---
I image the Poison would be the same.
---
NW has plenty of hackers. Just have to find people that don't have the quantum spam builds or will at least agree to some rules. No vats, legacies and teslas makes for a pretty fun fight.
---
Ah, the babyfood vomit recolour. Gotta hate that!
---
&gt; +5% damage per stack; nine stack maximum for a total of +45% damage.
---
&gt;Stacks reset to 0 after not hitting the target for &gt;10 seconds, but are not lost on missed attacks.
---
&gt;Stacks are reset on target swap, although the first attack on a new target may obtain the damage boost before resetting.
---
&gt;Shotguns and other multiple-projectile weapons test each individual projectile. For example, if 9 projectiles from the first shot hit one creature, the second shot will receive the full +45% damage bonus
---
The power plant usually has at least 1 bloatfly, near the eastern side.
---
Int boost give exp then event group even if your just running public events?
---
Thus the location of the camp; Sugar doesn't spoil so you can have twenty-thirt sat in your stash, you have as many Gourd as you plant, and the farm/field has around 10 Cranberry plants. It's just as efficent as Cobbler because of these factors and much superior in effect. I've also never experienced a shortage of wood, lol, considering the fallen logs all around the camp area.
---
There’s a way around that, too. 
---
In the end they’re just cheating themselves. Might as well go play FO4 with even better ‘God Mode’ settings if that’s what they want.
---
Bottom text
---
I just use 1 melee weapon to support my guns as needed and I still agree with this. Melee weapons have some really wild and unique appearances too compared to guns but there's hardly any of them. Just look at all the mods and different looks a baseball bat can have. More melee weapons need that kind of treatment.
---
1. Power Armor Adjustment for unarmed: Has no additional effects aside from letting you use it in P.A.
---
2. Ultracite Blade/Blunt head: Improved damage and additional damage to scorched.
---
3. Poisoned Blades/Blunt heads: to mirrror the sheep weapons.
---
4. Boom Speakers for Raider weapons: Allows you to ragdoll non-boss creatures on a critical hit.
---
5. Rockets for various weapons.
---
6. Handles made from higher quakity materials to improve melee swing speeds.
---
7. Stun packs that wrre available in Fallout 4 (Baton had it, but was removed).
---
8. Shields: They can have the effects to deal damage when being hit, or generate a stealth field (just like the legendary effects).
---
Between platforms? I dunno, I guess they want you to buy everything multiple times. The old Skyrim mantra.
---
Check your balance before and after FTing. When I’ve had that issue, it doesn’t actually change my totals.
---
No they don’t , what they need to add is text chat and removed that emotes wheel
---
I know this but it would save a lot of camp budget if they'd just add interior walls.
---
Thanks. The Mothman eggs make them a little harder to make, but that extra INT may well be worth the extra effort.
---
I know dude!!! They can get the most “Fallout” looking weapons from the melees. Like imagine a Barbed Multi-Purpose Axe, that’s some grade-A mad max shit right there
---
Hahaha I think he is in his underwear more than he is in his clothes. That boy nasty
---
They patched Rocksy.
---
I'm trying a melee only build and I don't like it. Many of the enemies have a ranged attack as well. This makes you get more damage, spend more time sleeping, or using up crap ton of healing items.    
---
My main is only 55 and I don't have only grouped with randoms at times. I don't anyone who plays 76 so these end-game builds people make and post aren't helping people who are 1-50.
---
It happened to me before but now seems to happen more frequently since I signed up for 2FA. I am an infrequent player (a session every couple of days), not sure if that has anything to do with it. It's even more annoying with 2FA because you have to manually close the program, sign out of the launcher and sign back in with 2FA. Good times.
---
Good man. Some nice extra info; thanks.
---
You need the prime reciever for either the Gatling ot Ultracite Gatling laser. It drops from the SBQ event. Once you learn the reciever plan, you can craft them for 2 fusion cores + 1 violet stable flux. You do not need the qeapon plans for the ammo, just the prime recievers.
---
I like the fact that I have something to do with mini nukes/missiles. I am concerned that if it becomes too good, players will interact through ammo less.  
---
We should be allowed to box ammo into quantities greater than 1 for sale, thus allowing fractional cap sales. The ammo converter should be a sort of last resort with a bad exchange rate, like trading with the bank in Catan.
---
Bold strategy. I'll contact customer service tomorrow and update you. I highly doubt it will work, but it sounds fun.
---
Maybe somebody here with FO1st will help you capture the ammo workshop on a private server to get you started. 
---
I would, but I’m on PS4.
---
What kind of pvp are you looking for?
---
You need to make her face look more chill, instead of looking like some sad bitch.
---
Or just write them out of the game and get rid of them, the scorched are a terrible enemy and the beasts are pretty boring and worthless too. Add a month long event after the BoS arrive that is a fight to eradicate the scorched once and for all. Hell give glass cavern to the super mutants and buff them and behemoths. Might as well make the glass cavern a great area to go fight and farm.
---
I do 2 cause u can get twice the amount and if ur lucky enough get something like a b25 fixer/hm
---
I can show you my SPECIAL distribution. Imo, a very good Melee/Rifle or Commando build. Can get up to 7k damage with a good Bloodied melee using no enhancers besides perks. PM me and I’ll lay it out for ya, I’ll make it as simple as possible.
---
What’s the way around the godmode score thing?
---
I would love a few for my main char.    
---
I got lucky with my level 30's gunslinger who has a low level 5 .44 revolver. It's condition bar is too small to be anything but a backup.
---
Nw had plenty of hackers. My whole comunity didnt encountered a single one, and even ppl which are known for cheating are free kills since update 20.
---
Goodluck finding someone who follow your rules, all people I know which are up for adventure pvp are heavy sweaters which need 30mins of preparation to fight for 5mins ( special char, each time they die they mule for counter gear and so on) or are the mentioned exploiter. I didn't encounter someone who's up for a chill and fun pvp fight without yelling "I f#$@% you all".
---
Sadly tho.
---
Ty for this 
---
I only play 2hours a day and focus on doing my dailies and rep quest.. and weekly log off 
---
But I do want the rank 100  PA skins so for me it about getting as close to rank 100 as possible 
---
then buying the rest of the ranks on the last day
---
Don’t stress yourself especially if your a working adult , no way to keep up with the teenagers who have the freedom to play more
---
Put on green thumb in perception and walk the river along the east side of the map
---
I'm fairly certain we'll be getting the Bog Wanderer Outfit this time -   
---
'The one with the hockey mask and sweater from the Datamines'
---
Yay. Thanks guys
---
I like the NW challenges a lot because they've been getting me into more NW, and I am getting better at it. I do like the ones that are more under my control, I didn't manage to finish the revive challenge even though I played a whole lot yesterday, placing high and winning some.
---
Wow ty so much this is a great idea
---
O u mean that. That has been a problem since NW released. Joining NW when the challenges resets does that. Never really been a problem to me.
---
Whats today NW challenge? I havent been on yet and itll be a few hours yet before I can
---
Rank up your heavy gunner cards.
---
What bench do I craft them in?
---
What’s the Bethesda handle so I can link em to this.
---
Can only get them from here, they no longer drop, some examples include explosive energy weapons and legendary rippers, there’s more but I can’t remember
---
Well... I normally find the sugar bombs to be a problem, since they have to be the radioactive kind specifically. Either way, glad to help.
---
Damn that one is really up there!
---
I was getting 1.9k per sentry but at white springs and theres 4 which is almost 100 score in 4 kills
---
I wish I knew. I mad e apost about this very same thing a couple of.months ago.
---
It doesnt count period. Ive tried and tried. 
---
Extremely disappointed that they never took into account NW other than a single daily. Everytime they add another big feature its like they forget about the previous big feature.
---
I guess my question now is, what is the base reload time of the BPR, if I'm reading correctly if it's anything longer then 10 seconds which isn't factoring it aiming and enemy movement. With the reload speed increase I should be fine, but would like to know for future reference.
---
How about trap camps that hit players at vending machines with decontamination showers rather than trying to kill them? Asking for a friend...
---
I've seen at least 5 NW hackers today alone. I've got several people I pvp with that we do all sorts of weapons and stuff with. I know who most of the hacked weapon assholes are. They are fun to kill.
---
Wait, how do I get them again ? Im confused
---
Don’t stress to much about it after lvl50 the rest are pointless you can unlock more perk card and switch them around but the amount of perk card  you can equip is still locked by lvl50
---
Equipment is also cap at lvl50
---
In the Tinkers workbench, under ultracite ammo. Should be at the very bottom of the list.
---
Not rare you can get it on any new character by siding with them
---
yeah I didn’t realize bethesda added blimps until yesterday
---
none of the whitesprings bots give me xp at all
---
I agree completely. I’d love it if they made melee like it is in TES V. I’ve got a melee mule on my second account in case upgrades like that ever happen.
---
Mainly explosive enegery weapons, they are legacies since they no longer drop. 
---
There are also others like double weapons or legendary Dragons and harpoon guns, but people grab these usually just for collection.
---
If you want one, prepare to trade away multiple weapons/armour with very good rolls, usually not sth a noob can manage.
---
No, there isn't. By stepping into a decontamination shower, or using a radaway, while you do not have Starched Genes equipped, will cause you to lose a mutation at random.
---
Between Flatwoods and Morgantown should net a lot. I know theres a few plants toward Flatwoods and another few around the Gauley mine area and I think Morgantown has another bit of a hotspot for them
---
Can you explain all this "Bloodied Build" business? I keep seeing it and reading about bloodied, 2 shot weapons.  
---
My main does have Bloody Mess maxed if that helps. Link your build I'd like to see it.
---
I love this spot. There’s another tea party roughy equidistant from the vault, but east-southeast, with a skeleton and a teddy bear sharing a pot of rat poison to usher in the apocalypse.
---
Are you us?
---
I mostly play on EU servers, when its night for the us.
---
Funny to see such differents, nw feels also pretty different at this daytime (5am here).
---
yup
---
The issue is trolls would disrupt other people's dialogue and cause them to have to restart a conversation over and over again. It also gives players an avenue to kill high level creatures (like sb), and doing minimal work to get the entire reward.
---
Wait, legendary dragon ? I have that...some guy dropped it to me, is it "legacy" ?
---
Here I’ll PM you so we don’t crowd this discussion too much
---
507 is impossible to have. This just makes me not believe you even more then before. Everything increases by the rate of 100 250 500 1000 and 1500. The score increases 25 per rank. Impossible to have a 7.
---
Anout 1 shot every 7 seconds. BPP is closer to 5.

It does not look as good as I expected. It is too artificial, too much volume and little "gravity". Ended up removing it, because my raider sniper loves his leather.

I bought the flyboy bundle thinking it included the flight helmets, it did not. I messaged bethesda support and they refunded me the 1200 atoms and let me keep the bundle. I think once they have your real money they don't care so much about refunding some fake currency.

Yes
---
Oh.. That sucks to hear. No idea why Bethesda wouldn't put the *entire* set into the game.
---
Laziness
---
This post is wonderful in many ways.
---
It's a nice and informative way to show anyone who wants to put the effort in to grinding out the season a way to go about it.
---
It's also a great showcase as to why the way the seasons are implemented as they are, aren't a great way to go forward. It's busywork that feels like busywork, and doesn't really feel like you're playing a game to play the game.
---
The easiest comparison I can make is to Destiny 2's seasonal model. They've got the freebie and premium paths for their seasons, however, both paths still require you to get experience to progress. The key difference that D2 has going for it, is that every activity you participate in gives you experience to one degree or another. (Specifically bounties, but that's another can of worms I won't delve into) The ultimate point is: Every activity you participate in in D2 gives you progress on their season pass. You don't feel like you're actively grinding one thing or another specifically for season progress, you feel like you're actually playing what you want to play and getting progress as a bonus.
---
If we didn't have this stupid SCORE system, and it was just raw XP, seasons would go over way smoother, and wouldn't feel like busywork. They'd feel rewarding, instead of like chores, or like the totally not subtle way to get people to feel like they're going to miss out on things so they have to buy atom bux to spend before all the sweet cosmetics vanish never to return. (until they inevitably return because they gotta keep pulling the "YOU'LL MISS OUT ON THIS SWEET DEAL IF YOU DON'T GET IT WITHIN THE NEXT 2 DAYS!" bullshit)
---
Apologies for the salt at the end. I had hopes for this game, but the constant MTX shenanigans are really souring me to it fast.
---
Generally you'll have to cough up real-world money for these.
---
Well, two words then: HECK. NO
---
This game is stupid easy. Everything dies in 2 bullets after a certain point. You dont need a group for anything.
---
Ah yes.... the 2600. Simpler times those were.
---
If you're referring to the Halloween and Christmas items. No they did not. I just unlocked a Christmas gun skin.
---
Not working on both methods :(
---
Yeah it’d be so great
---
I’m hopefully with the big update in September they will balance out weapons more to go alongside the lvl sync
---
From the current understanding they would need to form a connection to a server, so not an overnight solution but somewhat plausible to replicate the challenge data to the front end connection server along with news/etc.
---
PS4 frozen invulnerable super mutants.
---
If you want to go for the ideal build in every single way, it is not the best choice, but it does a bit of everything and I used it for a while, without feeling harmless.
---
In this game, damage comes from legendary effects, multipliers and perks. A good rifle will cause good damage whatever its accessories.
---
Would be nice but seeing as stuff like this has been asked for since day one an they have like 2 people working on this game I highly doubt we see it anytime soon.

Yeah

If somehow I spawn in high radiation and cant get to the edge, i would rather be over burdened than constantly dieing and getting sent back to the start.
---
Well I would prefer them to fix everything that's broken the first place instead of try to add things that's really not necessary.
---
1. Fix fast travel so you actually travel the first time not on the 10th try.
---
2. Fix weapon swap so it will switch to the weapons you are using not some POS you just picked up.
---
3. Fix the Gauss shotgun so you don't have to put it away to use a stimpak in the middle of a queen battle.
---
I urge everyone with Fallout 1st to cancel your membership now! Until you hurt their pocketbook they're not going to do anything to improve this game for us true die-hard Fallout fans.
---
It’s not a rare mask anymore. As in anybody could get it if they felt like making a new character and it would only take about 30 minutes or so. Specially if you have a friend help you with fast travel and killing the enemies for you. 
---
They were unique and rare before, when they had legendary effects on it. But a few updates ago they took the legendary effects away.  Now it’s just a mask. I’d pay 100 at most for one.
---
I was not commenting on the difficulty of the game. What I was commenting was how anti social a lot of people are. Joining groups before this update just helps farming go faster due to the fact you move faster, jump higher, and get more xp. There were no downsides. 
---
Giving me that reason no one joined groups just because the game was easy is a weak claim.
---
Some of those rewards were 7000 and 14000 xp
---
No I agree
---
You also have Skyrim, Titanic, Breaking Bad, Blade Runner... And there are more!
---
probably will be patchted tuesday morning
---
I never realized there was a submenu and this was making me bananas. Thanks for posting your response.
---
The ammo converter was designed more for the new players 
---
The players that have 100-200 ammo they can convert quick 
---
Not the lvl5000 player that has 500,000 ammo 
---
Keep that in mind lol
---
20 hours after u initialy used it.
---
20 hours after your first exchange I believe
---
Follow the river from just south of Hillfolk Hotdogs to Flatwoods. That's my go-to spot.
---
Nice
---
Intelligence doesn't affect XP points in Fallout 76...
---
I don’t have high enough charisma to share the card you want. But also, did you already buy the mod plans for the gauntlet? You won’t be able to modify or upgrade it, unless you also bought the mods/plans for it with gold.
---
Your not solo in a public team though xD
---
558 DR 658 ER modded Vanguard Scout armor.
---
The game makes you change your collection strategies as you level. Keeps things interesting. As a lvl 76'r I've been finding scrapping all non-legendary guns to be helpful!
---
Shablagoobuddy is my ID if you're wanting to add.
---
You can freeze her with less ammo. The ammo is kinda heavy.
---
i would appreciate that
---
&gt; Many of the enemies have a ranged attack as well. This makes you get more damage,
---
The right set of armor will neuter most ranged attackers. Also, the right mutations will help you close the distance more quickly, such as Marsupial (to jump up to where enemies are) and Speed Demon.
---
Alternatively, you can also just go full stealth instead. Sneak up on everything and get sneak attacks.
---
Yeah, there's no way in the world I'd spend 45 mins doing something should only take seconds to do if it was designed better.
---
Go to ebay. Type Gatling Plasma Fallout 76. Buy one for 150 bucks on a good bid. If you want to ibtain one legit, try your hand in getting the red assylum outfit, a b2525 handmade, or b2525 fixer. Once you obtain it, gi to a trading subreddit, and see if any one bites (most of them will). Trade with said player an obtain said legacy. Good luck.
---
Thanks for the feedback! Always looking to make her more accurate. This has been a while in the making and honestly the back and forth viewing of the original and my recreation kinda blurred the line between them for me.
---
Thanks I almost spent way too much on one
---
Yuppers! Wakshaani on there as well. My cam's usually just south of Morgantown. Easy to spot. :)
---
It only takes neighborly with settlers. So not quite ally.
---
I say they provide specific spots around the map as Pioneer Scout Camp Sites. If your camp spot is taken you can choose to spawn at one of these camp sites and have prebuilt things just for you. You can still decorate this camp, but some building limitations would exist. Say you load in and the camp cant be placed, it could say, “Would you like to deploy a C.A.M.P Site instead?” And you choose a preloaded area to become your camp site. These camp sites could even be pre fabricated Pioneer Scout locations. It will load your save campsite. I just think the problem if approached creatively could be turned into something fun and not something as inconvenient.
---
Like many other things, it's something that was just ripped directly from fo4 and never used. Until people on pc stole it from the dev room, it still provided damage resistance like in fo4. They removed it once the helmets became widespread. And it's clearly a choice made somewhere in the middle of the line, because if you look at atom shop datamines dating back even to early 2019, you see paints for marine armor, including the mask (and for the wood armor/wood mask). So the artists are designing things for the whole suit of armor but somewhere along the way they are consciously deciding to hold it back, and I'd imagine that is the reason why we never got any marine armor paints
---
you cannot. they were in the loot pool at the beginning but long since gone
---
I would think it would include public teams, but I can't be sure, as I have already completed that achievement pre-patch 20. Its wording is just "Join 20 teams" so I would assume public or private doesn't matter.
---
Yeah, MOST of my stuff is cheap, but maybe ten percent is high-end stuff. Depends on what people need, honestly.
---
Yes I just have to grind 5 levels to get the perk so I can craft it but I was hoping somebody could help me out with a shortcut lol
---
What the hell are you talking about. It's the single strongest PA set and you want to make it even stronger?
---
It’s at the brewing station that you can place at your canp
---
Understandable. I don't have many online friends either, but I'm always happy to make more.
---
If you're ever on PC, be sure to look me up!
---
Ah!! Thank you!
---
I've been noticing a little bit more lag as if late. No kicks, but definitely lag. Xbox
---
So just to be sure, its under fermentable spirits (i think) as "Fermentable nukashine" when you use a brewing station, you would have had to make some for the questline.
---
I played since game came out but stopped playing after main story until last October and I never could get a explosive gun except for pipe weapons or revolvers. It was until around 130 I got my first ever explosive drop from a queen fight. It was a nocturnal assault rifle. Wasn’t the best but I was so happy to finally get a explosive one. Since then,  I’ve gotten 2 combats with it, railway rifle, handmade and sub machine gun, Gatling gun and mini gun. Only crappy part is mini gun and handmade are beserkers and damage is crap being my damage resistant is high
---
I'm not sure if the info up top is taken from datamines, fo4, or something else, but it seems to vary a lot more wildly than that. Maybe it depends on the weapon, but for some of my other rifles the bonus resets after 1-2 seconds of not shooting, even if every shot hits
---
You’re welcome enjoy using it you find a lot of unique places and will see some rare things👍
---
No problem. Glad I could save you a few caps. Like I said. If you really want one. Make a new character. And instead of helping the people at wayward. Make sure you side with the raiders when he gives you an offer. Eventually they will show up at the wayward and hold them hostage. I THINK you need to have high charisma or intelligence to convince them you really wanted to join them. And once you do, the quest ends and you get the mask.
---
Yea I understand man. Sorry I couldn’t be of help. Just be patient. Maybe somebody out there is running a 15 charisma character to help you. Otherwise you’re gonna have to grind it out lol
---
I can already see people be selling hacked 3-star tatoes that can one-shot SBQ.
---
I would like to know the answer to this also. Sounds like it would, but not positive.
---
Ha ok but let’s stay on topic. Not a triggered frenzy.
---
I’m struggling to farm ammo honestly I burn throw 2-3k ammo per play session. 
---
I got a gatling leaser yesterday so hopefully this is a solution for me since each fusion core = 1k bullet and they super easy to farm    Via workshop
---
Well legendary the dragons dont drop anymore afaik, so that makes it legacy, though being a legacy doesn't make it automatically good. For example, anything with the prefix "Double" is classed as legacy even though Quad is actually better in most cases.
---
For 1650 gold bullion it should be Legendary! Or at least add extra damage and rad resist to our armor! 1650 gold bullion just for a flashlight?
---
I hate leg day and NW like I love my wife - intensely.
---
It costs 1990 points to fire gun for 12 second.
---
you need 3 CH to share one perk level, perk level 5 would be CH 15. dont wait for an uny build with the plan to craft it for you, invest the points to makeshift warrior. you will need it anyways to repair the gauntlet to 200% of its condition.
---
It's not at all crazy. People exploit (not in the cheating way) any advantage offered to them. It's why bloodied builds are everywhere. It's why most people are on teams. 
---
Seems like a natural evolution given the current meta. I expect much the same with Empath.
---
Must be just waiting on the high level ones then. The 2 14K ones I have not got one in over a day
---
Not even 12 considering mine has faster fire rate
---
You've not playing in a Build team before :)
---
Is your name a reference to that one charming, rustic restaurant at Jackson Hole?
---
Sounds pretty good, I'll definitely have to finish the quest!
---
Frankly, all PA could use something to increase disease resist. I shouldn’t get one through a suit of metal and a gas mask just be standing near that ghoul...
---
As for a set bonus - how about a 10% chance not to consume ammunition when firing?
---
Yes it's on the roadmap.
---
head to r/market76
---
Okay fair enough. It's outrageous that the bug is still present.
---
It didn't matter so much before, since atoms were the only reward, and atoms were perpetually available anyway.  
---
But now there's a time limit on it, and it's too easy to fall behind on the board if you miss out on any score points.
---
So I never could get I and I was able to buy it from a guy off of here for 5k caps and last night we killed this thing with ease and what do you know I get the plan lol that stuff always happens
---
Start at Gorge Junkyard river and follow that East. Just stay in the river and look around, they’re everywhere. Also down the west of the map on the river is a large amount as well. Near Flatwoods also. Rivers are where you’ll find it.
---
yeah i’ve thought this, with all the people bitching about how hard it’s gonna be to hit max level in the run, doing the “math” and freaking out that if you did every challenge you wouldn’t have enough XP. NOT taking into consideration the weekly repeatable XP gain challenge, or any double XP events that might happen. Like, these things aren’t meant for EVERYONE to get. The items at the end are SUPPOSE to be difficult to obtain. That’s why they’re at the end.
---
Agreed, since this would give a purpose to every set of power armor without additional grind. Though strangler heart could use a buff, since 50 acid damage does next to nothing now...
---
Kill three creatures. Took me 10 matches. Didn’t see any and because I was looking for them I kept getting sniped.
---
The plan is on a computer terminal at the front to door to fort Defiance.  You can access it as soon as you learn of fort Defiance in the quest...not at the end.
---
open to see whats out there honestly. i play NW a little bit but going from playing my regular character to that isnt satisfying to me. i hunt wanted players and try to take workshops when i can but people arent super keen to fight back. i dont have a full set of assasins ap refresh sentinel armor or anything crazy, but i like the idea of gaining or losing a couple thousand caps if im enjoying myself.
---
Thats a great idea! They had arcade cabinets in F04’s creation club so they could reuse that plus add your idea.
---
It worked for me, but it may be a glitch
---
Honestly, I’d rather not have to grind for legendary effects on my power armor. It’s frustrating enough on regular armor. Instead, I’d prefer strong set bonuses for each.
---
I believe that too especially since we getting zoned camp with that update
---
It just works - Tod Howard
---
I liked eso but no guns unfortunately. 
---
Thanks though.
---
Just tried it. Amazing. I had no idea there was such a setting!
---
I always in the fire zone with the encryptid robot. Everything seems normal.
---
Key emphasis on JUST. “It JUST works.”
---
It sounds like the reloading bench, gunpowder and casings were a far better ammo-crafting solution than our method in 76.  
---
Makes me miss it even more.
---
My thoughts exactly. But I guess I'm an asshole for pointing out that people seem to want the easiest way possible.
---
No, you're right. We should lower our expectations to that of mediocrity.
---
Of course a lot of people are going to want to get to Rank 100. That's where most of the cool items are.
---
Also, remember that Bethesda got rid of a perfectly fine system for earning atoms and gave us one where even if we get to Rank 100 we get massively punished (relatively speak) if getting stuff from the atomic shop was what you mainly wanted. 
---
You're punished even more if you don't get to Rank 100.
---
It does, but I think this same soft cap comes into play there as well. I barely noticed a difference in rads taken in a nuke zone with excavator and strangler. I am using the PA hud however, so perhaps I just couldn’t see it.
---
Thank you. I might have a crack at that one. I didnt bother at all with yesterdays since i solo. I just doubled down on the xp grind to make up for it
---
While having both of those as new suits would’ve been great, I definitely wouldn’t have wanted hellfire to be locked behind a battle royale mode I’m not interested in.
---
They removed that feature when people were abusing it with trap bases.
---
Yep. I even went and bough the recipe so that I could make it. It sold out immediately.
---
Antiarmor explosive pipe bolt with rifle AND pistol perks. It really kills and I can be at full health.
---
Any bloodied commando weapon is the most versatile weapon in the game. Just choose one you like. A 38 Fixer, a faster fire handmade, a hardened SMG. Once you have your perks and build done, everything dies.
---
I've never even heard of ME Andromeda but it would have the gun play we're looking for. I'm hopeful.  Does it have quests you can go on, weapon modding and especially PVE ? Ihaven't played any of that series since ME 2 I believe. I see some sites saying it's bad but it's 9/10 on steam. 
---
Thanks.
---
It's just really weird that they would even bother putting the other pieces in if they aren't going to add *all* of the pieces of the set. I've heard that the armor itself isn't as good as others that you can obtain, but I just liked the look of it a lot and not being able to get the full set makes me not even want to use any of it.
---
I use to play just like that but getting 50% more damage by having 5 addictions means crafting ~50% less ammo. So it was a no brainer for me once i learned more about it
---
Ghoul Slayers Gamma Gun, Bash Damage, 250 reload DT.
---
sell them for 20-30 caps each. people will def buy them.
---
Maybe your explosive weapon is getting better
---
Every time the circle gets smaller new mobs randomly spawn. A scorchbeast is the only reliable spawn once the circle gets small.
---
Make challenges quests?
---
well yeah and no, you earn points during matches you use to get weapons, armor and characters with different skills you can modify
---
the matches are all player vs npcs and theres a good assortment of maps
---
Dragon Age:Inquisition has more of a team based travel through a dungeon but it's not a shooter but it's also players vs npcs with mechanics thrown in and setup the same way as ME:Andromeda where you join a match and play that way
---
Oh, I certainly don't think anything should be locked behind a pay wall or a second mode that not everyone plays. But if these devs have any imagination they can implement this stuff easy, we already have access to the Enclave and the Chinese secret base was the perfect place to add the Chinese PA. It would of been an amazing point in that mission if the alarm went of in the base when you are spotted and a squad of Chinese PA soldiers rolled out wielding Gauss weapons.
---
The only difference you’ll going to get is if you use certain legendary effects such as unyielding, strength armor sets.
---
Okay.
---
Thanks 
---
And I just looked up division, it appears to be open world but is there basebuilding and PVE ?
---

---
I don’t keep any plans anymore because I don’t bother selling them and definitely drop every mounted plans because everyone has them now. Tonight a player vendor had over 2k plans showing and guess what it all was???? Only plans I keep is s’mores because it took forever to get the fixer plan that I got last night after I bought it from a guy for 5k caps last week
---
Definitely, and if the prototype steel mill was a full set instead of just a helmet, it might have made the Raider playthrough have some nicer rewards.
---
Or if the strangler vines took over people and you fought against former brotherhood and Enclave soldiers decked out in those sets...
---
One of my favourite camp spots! Looks fantastic.
---
Sad. I want people t experience my camp by coming through the front door
---
You can adjust the location of the CAMP suitcase as it’s location affects where the players spawn
---
Hmm
---
The perk to make mutations stronger in a team requires a teammate to also be mutated. Doesn’t work just solo.
---
Shoot me a friend request. ign is newt341. I can kind of equip my character to something similar. I'm not a fan of teslas so I generally avoid using them.
---
heh, fun with nukashine
---
It’s been a HUGE pain in the ass, I grow to hate the game more and more after every update.
---
Would think that real life concepts would be somewhat translated to the game. I get that we live in a alt future, but a giant two legged tank could withstand a bug barb. Lol.
---
They change with your first server hop and you don't lose your caps. They don't get deducted from your total and sound doesn't play. To go back to the original icons you have to restart the game.
---
Thanks!
---
Thank you so much. Just tried this and got 58.
---
Watoga high school
---
NW does need some attention.. but I would rather they added completely new pvp modes like faction deathmatch or ctf type games.. pvp with time based matches and the ability to respawn would be much more inviting for casual pvp players.
---
I think Tyler county fairgrounds is best. Like 100 plastic cups on the ground
---
I had like three Ghoul Slayer's Gamma Guns in my entirety of this game before they stopped spawning.
---
Spawn point seems to be north/northeast of the CAMP item.
---
fort defiance (inside the converted psychiatric hospital). The red dress is worth a lot if you gind it.
---
If they full-assed everything we would get less content
---
Endgame armors should have set bonuses.  SS doesn’t even have one, both PA and NonPA
---
Also Morgantown Highschool is great too. 😊
---
Ooo the strangler idea would be great, coming across a squad of strangler enemies from BoS in PA with laser weapons to Super mutants with miniguns and missile launchers all with DR/ER buffs and extra health plus they deal small amounts of poison damage with all their attacks. Would make the mire a great end game area.
---
tag it for search you would be surprised at some of the things you get plastic from.. its everywhere
---
Watoga or morgantown high school in the cafeterias.  Tons of plastic plates and utensils, plus morgantown has a quite a few plastic pumpkins you’ll find as well.
---
At least unnamed NPCs and guards should actually defend
---
I personally feel the biggest problem is that its fuck ugly and my current pa is much prettier and has all those paints I already used atoms to buy available for it whereas the T-65 has jack shit
---
I would also like to see a “secret” door with beer barrels or something like a Mob hidden meeting place.
---
Dont forget the Garden Gnome onlooker hiding in the bushes. Love this scenario, have had it as a loading screen for some time now.
---
Best Ive managed so far is a 3rd but I was pretty thrilled with that
---
That's a straight up logical fallacy. Hard disagree.
---
Lol I love hearing how PvP was shoehorned in. No, PvP worked as well as every other feature did. Bethesda just chose to listen to the PvErs suggestions that made PvP even worse while simultaneously ignoring nearly everything the PvP players have asked for.
---
It's clearer now though what your real issue with PvP content is. You selfishly strike down ideas that don't benefit you, regardless or not if they would be of any benefit to the game. Even if having a section of the game dedicated to PvP that would divert more PvP players away from the PvE groups, you can't have it. All because you wouldn't be interested in participating and can't handle the thought of someone having rewards that you don't. Even if those same rewards would be obtainable through the PvE content with a bit more work.
---
I have a serious question though, how are you being griefed in this game? There's nothing a player can do without cheats or exploits that you can't easily avoid or ignore. The two major exploits being used to trigger unwanted PvP (Electrically Charged, and the nuke mines) were just recently patched out, and they even removed team PvP from the game. What can a player do that is a clear abuse of the normal game mechanics that can legitimately be called griefing? If you open up yourself to hostility is that griefing, or you just getting yourself involved in an optional game feature that isn't for you? 
---
I'm really curious what your response is considering these "griefers" are somehow worse people to you than people who think just because it's online it's okay to wish death, rape, and all other manners of horrible things on another person. As far as I'm concerned there is very little someone can do to your online avatar that shows they're a worse human being than someone who has absolutely zero regard for another real living person.
---
"Best" two is relative.  Not at all the best if you're not running those builds.
---
New PVP weapon - "Tato Gun", becomes most coveted weapon in the game...
---
Mods would include: "boiled" which would mash on impact and cause burning damage. "chipped" cuts tatoes as it leaves the barrel into "chips", acting like a shotgun. And "slicer" cuts tatoes into razor sharp slices for armour penetration.
---
Could be fun!
---
In all seriousness -shutdown the game and restart. Sometimes that fixes it  sometimes you will see another attached structure that you need to scrap that you didn’t see before.
---
Same. I hope someone can help us!
---
Depends, really. I run through Whitesprings Gold Club and surrounds pretty often and pick up all the golf balls, pool balls, plastic cups, and pens. You'll also get up to 9 cans of dog food, various chems, usually at least one legendary, some Aluminium Canisters, and a handful of ammo. Top that off with all the Golf Shirts and Golf Skirts you get, which weigh 0.1 and vendor for 25 to 30 caps, and the Sulphur Drink Fountain being right there.. that's my favourite spot to farm plastic, but obviously it doesn't have the highest yield possible.
---
Damn looks like I'm wrong
---
Every time I try it seems to take forever to be placed in a team and then to get the game started. I feel like I can hammer westek in the same time.
---
This actually happened a couple days ago, I’ve given it sometime. Just came back and tried again. Still nothing but I’m gonna try again.
---
I think those are paper cups. But the ones with a straw give plastic.
---
Try picking up your camp and placing it in the same spot you had it
---
So they have steps in front of them?
---
I would rather they turn into gunpowder lead and whatever else it took to make them at a lower ratio that it takes to make them.
---
I was just on a Adventure server with a nuke zone that covered all of Watoga and off the map. It stayed that way for an hour lol visual glitch? A lot of wankiness with the dailys on Adventure, gonna stick to Private for Dailys.
---
The fast travel bug is so annoying omg... Please fix beth!
---
Do you have herbivore? Because I think without herbivore those percentages are halved.
---
I agree. But its FO76, keep them fingers crossed.
---
I love this “secret” door idea. There could be a mob and mercenary variant.
---
I trudged across the ash heap twice today just to avoid using my stash to unload. The lag n there would probably have taken longer.
---
I'm new to the game, level 20, got it on June 30th when the Battlepass event started.
---
What's this about a mod people are mentioning, i'm on PC, and I really need more resources to understand how to approach this game, cause it's quite a bit different than previous fallout's where I didn't have to constantly battle weight among other things.
---
Which logical fallacy is it? I’m pretty sure my logic makes sense since we can mathematically prove this
---
Are you on PC and, if so, what all are you after?
---
The stagger it can cause will interrupt SBQ's landing procedures and reset her flight or so i've read
---
Yeah the game is mostly pve and is one of the best looter shooters I've played in terms of the firefight gameplay and the enemy ai tactics
---
However that's really the only thing the game has, the PvP is about as shallow as fallout's, there's not as much freedom building your character, the cosmetics all look very similar so if you see other players, most of the time you'll all look like the same 4 dudes
---
There's no base building, just missions to go on and some stuff you can find in the overworld
---
But it's also one of those games where you'll find 40 different weapons or armor pieces that look exactly the same but have different stats, the stats are all randomized 
---
I wished I liked playing it more since the combat is so good, but there's nothing  about Division 2 that draws me in enough to get to those firefights
---
That's the only win I've had so far. Another time I got to second but scorchbeast targeted me as opposed to them.
---
Floating mole rats here
---
Morgantown High School-- not just trays, but there are pumpkins and golf balls, too.
---
There's also this cat lady house North of Bolton Green and East-Southeast of Morgantown. There's piles of cat bowls everywhere.
---
No, but, mainly because it didn't exist back then.
---
You forgot about grenade hopping and that’s it.
---
you can sometimes buy bulk plastic from bot vendors (saves time, not caps). Whitespring Resort (obviously) has a few.
---
Have you tried 7 days to die? The game looks really dated but it's a really good co-op survival rpg-ish game with base building and guns and stuff
---
I hope not.
---
Nah it will forever be like that. I moved locations because I couldn't delete anything on a stack.
---
Yeah i have herbivore. But even without it its still kinda good
---
Haven't dipped into adrenaline yet... How's it broken?
---
Your reward was a lot better than mine.
---
Yessir
---
erm...plans are used at reading. they are gone afterwards.
---
Since patch 20 it doesn't appear to work anymore
---
Tales of a Prydwen Junkie Paladin
---
Seems consistent. *sigh*
---
What is the sulphur water fountain?
---
I just bought an explosive harpoon gun at a vendor. I don’t think he knew what he had. It’s my first legacy. Can’t wait to try it out tomorrow.
---
The neon letter plans which are about 9k caps even with the vendor price perk 
---
Been saving up the past week but I kept moving my camp because apparently the places I kept choosing were hotspots, so I would never be able to spawn in with my camp.
---
Found a new spot, and have about 6k caps to my name atm, so 3 more days and it's mine
---
After that, pretty much wanna grab every other fancy furnitureplan in the whitespring vendor, and then move on to grabbing serum plans from the enclave
---
The revive one sucked.
---
"Kill creatures" is doable but oddly enough today it took me 5 games to find one! And I managed to get all three within it!
---
Genuine question, has anyone here ever actually paid for seasons (to skip ranks/levels/tiers/whatever) on any game ever? If so what game and why?
---
If you want diffusers I can set you up with it, but don't have a extra plan
---
I didn't know that I had a legacy too till I posted this and eh, its pretty standard
---
You drink from it, and it cures any diseases you have.
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=egbceXJs9J0
---
I never said we were being griefed i said if they add the dark zone type areas we would be its a hot bed for scumbags, all those types of pvp are..
---
Workshops are annoying enough with how buggy they are as it is.
---
I can’t because your right
---
You get the 'known' plans when you find a second copy of that plan that you already read.
---
All good lol just a heads up, i'd go plasma myself if they actually were more accurate.
---
the highest tier commando/rifleman weapon... lookin plainer than a low level wep smh
---
hope not. had to switch to gun fu and its slow af...  
---
  
---
good thing is, beth knows it. a dev [answered here 3 days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hjttf8/hotfix_for_adrenaline_perk) that they know it. i hope there will be a hotfix.
---
I just ate my lunch, and now I can't find it anymore 😭
---
Oh I see now
---
NP 
---
Plenty of other stuff in the game to drive us nuts - 
---
Glad to make it 1 less for you :)
---
Is this why I'm not getting credit for completing some challenges? Some that should be a no-brainer, like Ecological Balance.
---
What! When?
---
Ppl usually use armor piecing with a weapon perk. That usually killed players insanely fast even if they wear armor. 
---
The death speed of a non armor target and someone with marine is only a couple of shot difference with those perks.
---
If you want leveling armor, you can't beat the bonus to INT from Unyielding if you do a low healthy build. Otherwise, look for the best resistances with +1 int or +1 str.
---
Find the local pool table.  All the pool balls scrap to plastic.
---
this.
---
It took me four matches to find all three creatures for that challenge. I really lucked out on the last creature, it put me to rank 13(don't play NW very much) for the Atoms challenge and met the daily SCORE challenge when I killed a Grafton monster with a bone hammer as I died to the storm.
---
Cheers!
---
Yeah, exactly like that.
---
I’m such a restless person lol that I work on my knitting projects while in the NW lobby and also while hiding in a safe enough space. If it weren’t for that, I’d be super bored. I know other casuals like me will Netflix and NW.
---
But it's..... green? Yeah, I hate it too. But, knowing Bethesda, since the Screaming Eagle skin was such a success, they're most definitely gonna do that for a Fixer variant. Eventually.
---
Cranberry Bog Enclave Event is full of Muties
---
Plasma is actually not way more damage if you have demolition expert 5.  Then explosive is better.
---
I love leg day like I love my wife...intensely
---
When?
---
No
---
olished heavy metal has about the highest DR
---
but its RR and ER isnt the greatest, so in some areas youll still need your PA,
---
 I use bolstering heavy metal, vampire weapons and healing factor mutation...Nerd Rage helps a bit, too
---
10 something? Honestly I'll be happy it I just get the star wallpaper.
---
Cat house and Helvetia pool table.
---
Ultracite arrows and fight the queen with it.  The inaccuracy of the bow aside, I have a blast with my compound bow.  Sure I'll never take her down alone but I always hit enough for her loot and the adds go down easy if you have bow perks maxed out.
---
You can ask that about a lot of the game. Many of the choices don't make sense, and it only gets worse if you look through datamines or xedit and see how messy it really is at the core
---
I have a 3 star bloodied rolling pin.  With 90%reduced weight. I forget what the other star is.  I've considered taking it to a SBQ fight.
---
Yeah that's come up in my research a few times.  It is on a timer or what's the premise?
---
"Want to sell them after I read them" holy shit I'm dying
---
It doesn't matter if there's PvP or not. Online games have toxic players no matter what because there's always going to be shitty, immature people. Even if your theory is true, is it going to negatively affect you having the vast majority of these players you consider scum sectioned off to their own section of the map? Wouldn't it be nice knowing that it should be even easier to avoid these players? 
---
Removing PvP from the game isn't a smart option as it's just going to add more fuel to the "Bethesda doesn't keep their promises" fire. It's a feature that was announced with the game and even if the PvP community is the minority I think we're all aware how the game news media likes to latch on to anything negative about this game. So what's wrong with giving them somewhere separate to go where they can have fun? Doesn't that make the game better for everyone?
---
Also what Workshop bugs are you talking about? The most bugged aspects for Workshops I've noticed are the PvE portions, especially when defense events can't be completed because an enemy spawned into a rock or something. I've been PvPing in them since the BETA and can't recall a single PvP related bug specific to Workshops.
---
Just go in the middle of field, attack her and she will land to fight u. It worked for me many times since I was told about this problem. Maybe it depends on caused damage as well. 
---
Players want to be safe from mobs and it is totally fine. I go with vampire gatling and without any loot. Funny thing happens when she lands on me and cant cause me any damage and I am not sure if other mobs can. btw yesterday it happend to me 3 times in a row. I love this game:)
---
I like this idea. It would be pretty cool to visit an arcade in the wasteland. You could maybe even monetize it (1 cap to play) just to make it seem like real life. 
---
Maybe carnival games can be added too like the Whack a Commie or the shooting games and you could sort prizes by score. (Like a nuka cola if someone whacks 12  commies.)
---
Man, that would be awesome.    Just think of it when some jerks one-shots the event legendary  and everyone who got screwed pelts him with tatoes.  The stains should stay on the character for the next hour as well.  No damage, just mild humiliation.  
---
What a great suggestion!
---
If think this is overly exaggerated unless of course they buffed the colossus without mentioning it. Just 2 bloodied players can take it down within 5 minutes or less tops.
---
The key to doing Encryptid is to find a server with a lot of high level players. Then when you put the card in, do NOT immediately initiate the recall. Wait until the timer gets down to 2 minutes or so or until at least four people show up. 
---
If you have any pieces of Troubleshooters armor put them on and put level 3 refractor. Then heal with food or Nuka Quantums because they can stack. Then take a pylon and hopefully others will too. And then just try to stay alive and get a few hits in.
---
Lol, that's brilliant. Nuclear Winter and knitting.
---
If you're on pc, I can sell you a plan for 7k.
---
Put flechetts on it.
---
Many players would call that target pracrice.
---
"atomic vomit"
---
No timer, 7 days is just what you have til the first time you will be targeted and attacked, and from there on it's survival time
---
probably lmao
---
I've seen them next to Morgantown HS almost every time
---
Probably
---
Lol 😂😂 I just joined this sub ans this is first post I see 👍👍👍💯
---
This could be one of those lost in translation things. :) In Britain/Ireland/Australia/NZ it is an exhaust pipe. And here people talk of using a potato rammed on the end so the car cannot exhaust its fumes &amp; won't run. 
---
Might depend were you live, bananas are more expensive here :D
---
I agree with the buffing of most power armors. I rarely use PA as without it, my character has better energy and physical resistance without it AND able to use the secondary legendary bonuses and being able to carry more. 
---
The only thing that is lacking is radiation resistance, but that's pretty niche. Maybe Bethesda should consider adding legendary PA pieces?
---
The ghillie from the battle pass is only for pieces such as legs arms body. It does not apply to single piece suits that NW has.
---
I’m not taking it as a personal attack. You said in the last part of your message that I as the reader should stop pestering Bethesda about it for a reason that does not apply to me and hundreds of others
---
That would only work in F76 in the real world it would just not run. We could rig the potato with explosives (in F76). In fact Tato bombs would be fun
---
Did you try building a couple more foundations in one direction, then build a stairway down from the edge foundation that you added, then when stairway reaches the floor, add foundations there
---
And then see if any of the original foundations can be deleted
---
I unlocked a chest in a workshop, didn't know it was even a workshop and the game made me wanted no warning no red text just boom wanted then i'm hunted down by level 300+ killed me then i resurrect due to my gear and still wanted so another person comes and kills me..
---
I'd love to take that offer, but I can barely keep myself above 500 caps, haha.
---
Gong in where ? :))))))
---
Events marked with an exclamation mark (!) on the map. (Known as "Public" events)
---
All the public ones do (the ones with a ! on the icon)
---
Bobbleheads
---
Not to my knowledge. You just have to find them out in the world.
---
Ya I took it down with one other player and I didnt rum through too much ammo
---
Yea armor penetration is king atm, only counter is the perk that adds more max health, or taking health boosting and damage resisting drugs
---
I think power armor's hidden damage reduction is unaffected by the armor penetration perks but I'm not sure 
---
If I'm not running a rifle build myself, I usually try and only attack another plauer if I know I can get up in their face, since at medium to long range against a rifle build is suicide
---
Exactly! Glad I’m not the only one!
---
Lmao
---
What level were they? I don't know why anyone would do that on purpose lol seems weird for a troll move
---
you can get one from modus, theyre not super rare either
---
also theyre not much tbh
---
You need a normal fusion core to make ulteracite fusion cores. (doesn't matter how full just needs some left in there though.) 2 = 3 Ultracite. You also need to learn the prime ultracite or normal gatling laser plan. Use a tinkers work bench.
---
Tell me about it, occasionally a pack of yao guais land up in Crater and everyone stands around like it’s normal. On the other hand I saw a bunch of already dead yao guais where molly stands in her bar
---
It still helps from what I can tell so it’s still useful
---
Even if everyone with FO1st cancelled immediately, I doubt they would haul-ass to fix all the issues. They seem to fix on their own pace.  When they bother to fix at all...
---
I do like the set bonus idea. Could make having other sets worthwhile. One could give immunity to disease. Another poison. Perhaps one reduces jetpack drain. One boosts stealth. One increased chem durations. Or bonuses like the backpack mods that you dont get, like reduced weights.
---
I have no idea who that is.
---
They were like level 16 and 40 I think or something like that. It was under the large main bridge in Morgantown by the factory, they kept going in, dying, one guy kept reviving him, then finally he died completely, then the other guy goes and drowns himself slowly from rads as well. Definitely not any sort of strategy.
---
They changed this in WL. That reward pool was moved to Final Departure. You don't have a chance of a rare outfit from TTF anymore. For reference, the rare outfits you can get from FD now are Reponders Firefighter Uniform. Responders Firefighter Helmet, Forest Camo Jumpsuit, and VTU Baseball Cap (very bugged, doesn't display or inspect right).
---
That's too challenging for bathesta. All they can do is work hard on one thing then copy and paste it 1000 times. (The ammo converter)
---
Lol... You are Just dumb.
---
Purveyor or trading
---
The absolute greed of them hoarding the customization of this game just to make that much more money is fucking abhorrent to me. 
---
I've pretty much saved every atom up since I've started playing this game. Now while I don't particularly chase completing the challenges to get them it shouldn't matter.
---
I can't really buy much more than a couple of plans or outfits etc. Fuck this game for that.
---
Get to the team menu (PS4 press and hold option), tab over to where it lists your current teammates, scroll down to your name, select, then hit leave team.
---
So to the tab that lists the team members, go to yourself and leave them that way
---
You have to read the plan before any drops. But once you read the plan, they get added to the rolls of legendaries that will drop for you.
---
I might be misremembering, but doesn't Riding Shotgun give notes? That's not a public event.
---
I can only comment on PC controls.
---
Open the social menu with Ctrl+Tab, switch the tab from the public teams one to the one just to the left of it (I forget what it's called) - the one that lists all your team members. Right-click on your own name and click "Leave team".
---
Dunno about console interface, but I assume it's somewhat similar.
---
Yes, this. 
---
I do Encryptid a couple of times a day and unless you're highly experienced, you need at least 4 decent players to be successful. The biggest problem is that people don't seem to realise that they need activate a pylon. They just stand around pointlessly shooting the sheepsquatch imposter with its shield still active. I've lost count of the amount of times I've had to activate all 3.
---
Ours must have been a Super Wendigo Colossus? It took us forever and a lot of Ammo! I don't know why it would be a pushover for some, and a nightmare for others?
---
Read the plan now see if I can roll one
---
Check under the social page where you join a group. You should see different tabs like, friends etc. Under one of them you have the choice to leave the team.
---
It is, id say just keep the fixer though, They sure are worth a ton and to have one in possession is crazy
---
Nice likeness!
---
What food items help if I have carnivore? I have a bunch of other mutations if I find all of them I’ll buy them again and switch to herbivore but for now I know that scorchbeast brain is good but what else is there if any?
---
It'll include a terminal where you have to trade in each PA component one at a time for PowerPoints, and then you'll have to trade the PowerPoints back in to the same terminal to purchase displayable PA, but at a 500% markup.
---
Perfect, thanks. Figured I must have been missing something.
---
Bethesda and UI just don't mesh xD
---
That is another good way of doing things too...but the set bonuses would probably never stack up to optimal three star normal legendary armour.
---
Then again...power armour can be used in nuke zones where normal armour can’t (outside of being  in a team sharing the right perks)
---

---
Neon splatter paint for the rolling pin
---
He might have been a friend of his and failed to saved him so he offed himself
---
My Stalker's Rolling Pin could really use a nice recolour 😂
---
Only as a rare drop from savage divide and messenger events
---
Triangle-shaped sections would be useful as well.
---
Absolutely sucks.
---
Because the vault dweller doesn’t look like my character at all.
---
Where is the eye patch?
---
Where is the moon boot? (Trapper leg piece)
---
Where is the third hand coming out of the stomach?

Some higher profile games have been on Gamepass for well over a year, especially if Microsoft and the company in question are on good terms. 
---
Besides, alot of people think that the games not being permanent is a flaw, when they counteract that with big sales on each game in the gamepass, were you to enjoy it enough to purchase it. 
---
It's a good thing. With all the upcoming updates outlined, a nice 6 months would definitely be enough time to consider buying the game or not.
---
Bolton Greens has a decent amount. There is no recipe for them.
---
The only ones outside of those that give notes is shotgun,daily photo, raider, and settler quest.
---
100k TRADE VALUE seems high, but I guess I could see it in the right situation.  They used to be in the MODUS vendor, but now the only way they drop is from Savage Divide events as a rare item where you also get the jumpsuits.  
---
It's rare only because it's RNG to get it, but maybe more common as people had them before they were removed from the vendor.
---
I would love to make 100 308 ammo a pop for my lmg
---
Yes, definitely.
---
Laser sniper rifles from super mutants at Westek. 10 plastic per rifle with scrapper equipped.
---
I seem to have just lost one of my weeklies completely randomly. Not near the reset or anything, just planted &amp; scrapped a tato a few times to finish the build up a camp challenge, don't get a pop up. Check to see &amp; yep, the challenge is checked off, no S.C.O.R.E.
---
I was (&amp; am) 1000 pts from my next level, so I know I'm not misremembering. Gimme my score back dagnabbit
---
Didn't know that. Thank you for the info.
---
I still drop my 38,44,middles etc and buy ammo from vendors.  The only way.
---
At the current rate, here's what'll happen:
---
* They deploy a hotfix.  
---
* Adrenaline gets fixed, but weapons degrade 500% faster when using the perk.   
---
* Dupers discover a way to glitch out perk cards, allowing them to stockpile infinite copies of Adrenaline.  
---
* Hitting the Scorchbeast Queen with full adrenaline crashes the server.  
---
* Crashing out of an SBQ fight makes people lose their inventories.  
---
* Bethesda rolls back the hotfix, Adrenaline lingers in bugfix hell for months.
---
No worries buddy, i don’t use it and never got round to bothering to sell it, i had a look this morning and I’ve got just over 1500 shotty shells I’ll keep grabbing them  for you if i see them around. If you got any 2mm ammo (non ultracite) that would be a god send, if not don’t worry about it.
---
Is that the 20 times one?  
---

---
K thanks.
---
Server has been disconnecting A LOT as of recent. Also have freeze bugs (guessing server related) as well.
---
Yah it’s happening more frequently. Happens to me within an hour or few hours every server. Not every 10mins but still irritating nonetheless!
---
I just got this plan last night, but i'm on PS4. Good luck.
---
I almost won a nw to begin my last teamate idoticaly decided to stay when i say weve been spotted run and he sat their like a delicious fucking meal to the enemy team so i start playing very cautiously and then someone dropped a nuke and i started hauling ass outta there because one i didnt have a rad suit and 2 i was dead in the middle i turn around a corner and see a pair of guys heading toward me auto them down
---
Now the nuke went off near the end of the match so guess where the storm went? Right into the nuke zone
---
It was me a team of 3 and another solo
---
I had a few radaway and more than a few mirv nades if i could find this team i could kill them 
---
5 and a half mins later i die of rads and see the other team
---
On a roof
---
Inacessible to people without froglegs
---
And they just sat their all game till the last guy died
---
Cat house is definitely the easiest
---
What's that other one XD
---
Did they buff it majorly in the last patch?
---
Because I comfortably take out one in a few clips from my bloody FFR combat rifle.
---
It's not disabled, you can still download the APK for it and it'll work.
---
By siding with the raiders
---
Agreed. This post makes sense but it's way too much work to achieve a bunch of worthless shit. If the following seasons aren't better than the current one, I don't even see the point.
---
Lol sry for laughing, just the tone in that sentence was hilarious 😆
---
Ok, I had never even heard of it and found it in my inventory.
---
If it’s anything like SBQ the more people that show up, the tougher the bad guy will be. So 2 really strong players can easily down something whereas those same 2 players with a dozen low to middle tiers will fail.
---
Yeah I've found a few outfits that way. Doesn't look the greatest in my opinion but it's my collection now
---
No offence fella but you come across as a rather patronising and everyone is beneath you kind of person. You’ve asked for people’s opinions and they’ve given them to you, but yet you reply with a patronising comment. Maybe your camp was nuked on purpose maybe it wasn’t, griefing happens from time to time, but to go to the extreme of cancelling a sub because of one incident is well rather odd.
---
For the first time ever I got heavily into Fortnite last season which i believe was Chapter 2: Season 2 (main reason was 50 v 50 and the Deadpool Challenges, but anyway on the last day i was able to make it to level 57 with no time to earn the rest to reach 60 for the Meowscles character/skin. I had some V-Bucks that i got who knows where and it was enough to get me the 3 levels.
---
This Fallout 76 season my main goal is 88 for the Cosmos Power Armor Skin and if im short of any levels by the last day i will buy the necessary levels to reach it. Also if im short of 5 levels from 100 or something so close like that i will buy out the rest. As long as the buy it is less than the 1,500 Atoms we get through the season.
---
People in foundation dosent seem to care
---
Ally daily quests can drop them too.
---
I didn't think the female mesh looked bad but I realize that the backpack makes it look better than it normally would (Blue Ridge Backpack)
---
The only Q lives.
---
Here’s an idea
---
They wanna give secret service armor access to power armor mods (jetpack on regular armor chest piece) so do the opposite with t-65
---
The set bonus should be that perks that don’t work in power armor does work in t-65
---
Maybe so lol
---
If you're not hopping from event to event, yes. Because let's say an event gives you 600xp, a fully bonded event team will give you 1200. But I can get that extra 600exp by killing 4-5 high lvl mobs.. And that's if you're not trying by using all the other exp boost options. Like I said before, ideally you're in a building team and when an event is close to completing, the team leader changes it to event team and back again.
---
Interesting !
---
Was super excited to play the season and reach the max tier to get the most out of this game I paid for myself and my fiance and got the Fallout 1st subscription.
---
But because apparently I planned a camping trip for a week during the season before any news of it, I'm feeling punished and shitty Bethesda is using this FOMO tactic. 
---
This trip was on mind before the season was because Bethesda announcements vs actual implementation still *sucks*.
---
There is so many ways to make this better implemented and there's so many good models to follow. They are just wanting to fluff their server numbers. Plus, Max level characters are punished for this (takes longer to level up, etc).
---
Tbh anyone defending this season mechanic Bethesda did is a true bootlicker and pushover. 
---
Shame on me for having a life but also wanting to get the most out of a game I've invested ~200 dollars in.
---
The ammo converter is for decoration only at this point. Tried it once, nup.
---
You’re supposed to read the note
---
A plain bloodied with ffr, probably not. If the third stat is less vats cost, reload or weight reduction, maybe.
---
Someone hasn't learned the joys of Pain Train yet.
---
On PC I don’t get disconnected and sent back to the menu but I have noticed a lot more client crashes which are way more annoying
---
Yeah, I got a Gauntlet the other day form commander Daguerre quest, I assume it just pulls from the Purveyor pool.
---
I still use it. If you select the ammo you want to turn in and it loads the other thing just push back and keep going back and forth. It just gives me something to do even though it is useless
---
Jesus!
---
 The thought you put into this is commendable but what's the point? I'm gonna do all this work to max out this crap season thing for what? A bunch of useless, mostly cosmetic junk?  I could care less about winning at this thing.
---
 Show me one good, decent reward we get from this?!?  It's all cosmetics and bullshittery. I wanted to like the seasons, I truly did, but there is nothing on the agenda I have seen that is worth 1/4 of the work you suggest.
---
Allow us to buy legendary modules with effects of our choice to apply to secret service power armor
---
The perk Card Tank killer, and any drugs like overdrive, psycho etc make it quick. I can down someone with 3 shots from my handmade no problem.
---
Funny thing is is that my fixer will probably be more effective than any other legacy against the queen, so I guess I’ll just have my alt is it, thanks for the heads up
---
The current NW challenge for the legendary run is to revive a player, so sounds like they were maybe going for this? Then just logged out after completing it/failing and needing to start again.
---
If so then they really should have joined thier own team then set team fill to off if there was extra space. However many players don't play NW so may not be aware of it.
---
I have, I just want the option to kick the things. Similar to the legendary slugger thing on fallout 4.
---
Morgantown airport has scorpions running around, I'd go for that.
---
They were doing the res 2 players daily score challenge for NW. then died after to go back to adventure.
---
Ah ok weird when I was playing it was kill 3 creatures, just kind of an off putting entry experience to the game mode, but I guess we’ll expect to see more of that.
---
&gt;"Level up while wearing a clown suit and fellating a megasloth in a nuke zone"
---
Ugh. I came so close to completing this challenge but the megasloth did not find me attractive and couldn't get it up.
---
Except lone wanderer works on a team because its broken.
---
how do you get upvotes on this silly sub?
---
I prefer a challenge not shooting fish in a barrel
---
Both are dumb are ruin the gameplay for me
---
Yeah, I use a b/25/25 on the queen on commando, pretty much chews ammo up like a sumbitch' but it'll tear her a new one, especially when you crit every other shot in vats.
---
I do this on Xbox! Have gotten plenty of messages of thanks for selling plans dirt cheap
---
I agree with the other guy... cut that endurance back..
---
also.. you should be running max blacker.. ignoring 45% of incoming melee damage is huge in this game
---
also charisma.. cut that back too.. get all of that QOL out of those and theres your points..
---
cut them both back to like 4 or 5.. youre supposed to be a killing machine.. not UPS
---
I have a camp inside of a rest stop building, everything from Super Mutants to Radscorpions have spawned inside the building, regardless of my camp existing.
---
Not yet, and it’ll probably be another reskin of something. It’s been like three months since we got anything
---
They should hire you to produce the trailers for the game in the future!
---
There’s no hat with it right?
---
I sided with both and the settler side gave me a hat and outfit
---
Damn, have you been able to handle it or do they pretty much wreck everything 
---
I kinda am trying to find a pet friendly area so I would imagine that would be a no-go for your situation lol
---
To craft it you need salt and pepper.
---
I accidentally placed a foundation underwater in my camp months (maybe over a year?) ago.
---
It's still there as I literally cannot select it to remove it XD. Thanks Bethesda
---
If no one is activating the Pylons, lead by example. Encrypted is a great event because you have to sacrifice yourself to win it. Do not stand there and try to just do damage, and when you are down, don't tap out, you are still taking damage from the pylon even while downed. It's a team event, people that stand around are useless, even if they are bloodied.
---
I kept getting frozen on place trying to enter instances and had to close the application to continue
---
I periodically travel back to my camp to get a handle on it, turret placement rarely makes a difference because they spawn directly &amp; don't risk dying on approach. Alternatively it does create a decent XP/ Scrap farm once you find a system that works.
---
I have one of these.  So should I get my 1000 damage and then just hammer it with the cryo?
---
No, but white springs golf Club anda boletos green hace good smount, and general steak house
---
This
---
I haven't done the math, but there's multiple earrings of 150 atoms on the game board earned. I'm eating until the last day to buy my way through if I need too, but it's all good. Just gotta figure out what's worth getting in the end you know.
---
Every kitchen in the game usually has them, but the easiest locations are the Whitespring Golf Club and Helvetia in the restaurant. I usually grab them when I see them until I have ten in my inventory and replenish when I'm running low.
---
Nope.
---
Yep it’s the Tesla then that’s what I’ve been using
---
Everyone with a brain does this at a workshop to use the resources there instead of their own.
---
I'm PS4 unfortunately, great work anyway!
---
The high chr is only if you want to keep the treasure as well as getting the mask I believe
---
I actually was able to push it even higher up to 74 with herd mentality mutation and shielsed lining casual underarmor.
---
But this is only achievable with unyielding stats "double dipping". Without it I only get 15 less and cap out at 59, which is still a very good xp buff. 
---
So here's the deal: I got 14 base int, full uny armor gives 15 more. Herd mentality and Egg head give 3 and 8 respectively (because of strange in numbers perk), brain bombs is 8 on top of that (herbivore makes it that high) and berry mentats add another 5 (I also keep steady supply of them and use Chem Fiend perk to double the duration).
---
Public teams give 4, and I also wear shielded casual underarmor for 3 more. Marsupial subtracts 1 from the total and here we go, 59 int.
---
I run a bloodied unyielding build. So all options are always available to me. I just couldn’t remember for other reponle.
---
They only auto complete when you join NW when challenges reset. This has been in the game for as long as NW been out.
---
canned meat stew is also pretty good for a bonus
---
I see
---
Well thanks for sharing your experience! I probably would enjoy doing that, but I still feel like my pet would die instantly haha
---
So back to exploring I go
---
Oh I'm super happy to hear it worked!
---
I run a dollar store. My camp is out in the boonies north of Sacrament so if you're willing to visit enjoy 1 cap everything and my Responder farm roleplaying free stims and radaways.
---
why limit it at 2000? you'll just repeat the same shit of you hit the limit
---
I don't play NW and I still got the bugg though?
---
Yup, just spent twenty minutes building crap I neither want nor need at my camp only for it to cheat me out of my Weekly Reward. Fucking typical Bethesda bullshit.
---
The Morgantown train yard has two that spawn there .
---
Ohio River Adventures - there's about 20 life preservers. Each one scraps for 2 plastic, 2 rubber, and 1 spring.
---
This was honestly one of the things I missed most in the move from 3/NV to 4. I usually wouldn't remember to even activate the criticals in VATS, so it ended up largely unused.
---
&gt; time that I could have been using to actually do something worthwhile"
---
Welcome to the world of gaming.
---
I actually did try that and it just made my problem even worse.
---
...and the Lord said unto the Development Team: "Thou shalt not deploy anything on Friday,   
---
 but keep it wholly for the consumption of beer, lest anything break and spoilleth the weekend".
---
It be a cruel world sometimes
---
😂 i seen this too
---
Pretty self explanatory. You like doing a lot of events, pick events. If you like to roam around the wasteland and complete your quests, then go building.
---
It's probably so the connector part is facing a specific direction.
---
Dry I'm xbox
---
Well the only bug I know of that auto complete challenges is NW. 
---
It’s better to know what you were doing before the reset happened then post that that helps people figure out what is happening. Screaming about this does not solve the problem at hand or else ppl are just gonna assume it’s the NW Bug.
---
why does acid do nothing now?
---
Most handy, thank you.
---
Nah.. I'd rather grind steel at West tek and lead at lucky hole.. At least I'm getting xp while making ammo that way ;)
---
Gottcha, thank!
---
Oof
---
Im not using it for getting ammo lmao. I just get bored. I dont need steel or lead 😂
---
Well I feel like a dunce. This makes sense.
---
Haha.. Fair enough
---
Good job my dude! 
---
(I think I'm at like level 5 a hardcore pace of like 2 hours of casually dicking around every couple of days.)
---
If you are doing events back to back and only events and not killing absolutely everything i suggest the one for events.
---
If you are killing everytjing and bumming around between events and getting exp from different things (building, killing, events or whatever) i suggest the building teams.
---
I've heard that it does, but mine's parked next to a radstag spawn and they still come. 
---
Have a functional deer stand and everything.
---
So, probably building would be better roaming the bog and mire? Events are so quick and fast probably have to server hop alot if there's no events
---
I sold an urban scout mask for 20k less than a month on the sub we can't name here if that helps. I see them up for grabs there from time to time
---
Building is great since you get that extra xp boost which is always nice. If you like to roam around the wasteland than building is a no brainer.
---
22 1/2 currently.
---
It is kill 3 creatures, sorry my mistake. It as the day before that was revive  player.
---
Unless there is a world atom challenge for it?
---
Balance reasons
---
Two reasons. The connector is in a bad place. When you first place it its backwards by default (or atleast for me its that way when I place it)
---
I just gotta find what food and drinks that will help me out on intelligent and XP lol
---
Lived there up til a week ago. Fantastic spit honestly. Might love back there someday. Greenhouse dome returning pending of course
---
Not easy enough for bethesda to not make happen though over a year later and its now the backbone of seasons and we have to be mindful to not trigger it by just playing as intended. Thats beyond shitty its straight absurd.
---
I found everything there but gourds :/
---
I just hit 19
---
What system you on? If PS4 I can give you both the outfit and caps. I have about 5 sets
---
If you're not one-shotting with a black powder rifle, you're doing it wrong. Unless it's the queen in which case you shouldn't be using a black powder rifle because you'll get swarmed by adds while reloading. In other words, furious is not very useful on a black powder rifle. I use an instigating explosive one on my gunslinger build and it's a beast. I switch to a lever action for the queen.
---
Lmao no
---
That's what I do. I got like 500 just today.
---
A real bugstomper perk.
---
30 atm.  Dailies and grinding.  Took a few days off after launch otherwise I may have been a bit higher.
---
19 and a half.
---
Well it looks better then the stock combat rifle, but yea, if the internal parts are the same a paint job should also work

Yes, especially since some of them relate to playing Nuclear Winter, and you can’t even view them from the Nuclear Winter lobby.
---
I tried using the armco ammunition machine to make ammo for free and then i turned around and used it in the converter to get ammo that the armco couldnt make.
---
Yup, it faces away from you when you go to place it. It's not the only item that's facing an odd direction on selection, but it's possibly the least obvious if you're not paying attention.
---
I use a TS FFR Cryo for the queen, less than 1 clip and shes frozen lol damage doesnt matter when you're just using it to freeze her.
---
If you still need help in 2 hours I can give you a hand. I'm at work until then. Psn is fakenunchucks
---
Its more likely because of the location of the power connector. They are placing the generator where the connectors are closest to where they need them to be. 
---
My generator is enclosed in its own box. Likely 'back to front' and most definitely not straight.its just plonked down randomly, but the connector is exactly where I need it.
---
I wish you the best of luck!
---
Canned Meat Stew: 5% XP for an hour, plus it doesn't spoil!

Berry Mentats (+5 Intelligence)

Hope that helps OP.
---
God mode isn't fixed
---
Alright thanks, I’ll let you know if I still need your help by then
---
The weight bug after dying is that when you die you increase weight by a certain amount while in death. It does not make you immune to carry weight limits as to prevent people with millions of weight jumping around the map due to killing them selves.
---
The chest piece actually makes the sounds. Not the helm
---
I have never managed to see the radial field actually work, even against mirelurk spawn. At the same time, the extra 50 acid damage is almost unnoticeable on high level enemies - even against scorched conquerors and the like.
---
I don’t play NW ever but this one was pretty easy actually
---
Not sure about that,  it was working before.
---
It's definitely a bug. I can spawn in normally after I die but, it would just teleport me to that fast travel spot and the game thinks I'm alive but, I'm still stuck at the "Press SPACE to respawn". Ultimately, taking my weight limit into account like I'm alive.
---
Yet weirdly I started making this before public teams (expected a rush), low priced (299c) and havent sold any. The other mutations sell just fine
---
Just temporarily move or rename Fallout76Custom.ini. It will disable mods next time you launch and let you play NW. Just gotta remember to change it back to turn the mods back on for adventure.
---
Yea. My mule account is goded rn at least it’s not my main one
---
Just picked it up and was curious if it was worth anything, I never really intended to use it for anything other then cap fodder. Instigating explosive is definitely the right way to go, just gotta rng one.
---
Roxsy does but like no one else. I saw 2 Yao Guai and she was the only shooting it at The Crater. Both Yao Guai were level 70 glowing, and had killed like 3 other raiders before I fast traveled in. Also had Anglers and same thing. This is Dumb AI pathing. In Fallout 4 the enemy AI wouldn't be allowed to take 3 steps without having an entire settlement unload on them.
---
A little tip for another day where you have to build stuff;  use workshops. Cap a 'shop, build a very basic structure and even decorations for basically free.  
---
Also to note, some challenges were pinging early rather than at full completion and if you weren't paying attention you may have missed it. Not sure if that's fixed.  
---
You could try tally your total up and check. I know there's a few other bugs with the system too though =\
---
Yes and yes
---
Wait.... how does that work? This is the first I've heard about it.
---
Ive been trying to get GM'd so I can power lvl my new account
---
Yes you can get both guass weapon. It’ll just take longer depending on who you choose.
---
MODUS doesn't sell them anymore.
---
Ah ok. So it’s possible to get max rep (I believe that is what unlocks the plans/merchants) for both and all Gauss weapons?
---
You can still get everything from both groups. You just need to complete the dailies for each faction until you get ally rep.
---
All I'm saying is popping new serums to remove negative effects for an hour make you way more OP than Class Freak 3.
---
Ok. So after the main quest line just do dailies to get max rep with both/the other one?
---
And if you take the gold for yourself you’ll have to do more dailies
---
I camp in a few different spots and it happens everywhere
---
I lost 1000 in one of the weeklies. 
---
The challenge system has been known to be buggy for ever, with all the objectives that never register as complete. I'm not even surprised, just... miffed.
---
Idk... I feel like GM would bring the already low challenge of the game to zero. I’d be bored out of my mind
---
Yeah and you should take all the gold buillon for yourself ypu get an extra 500 amd you only lose a very smaal amount of karma
---
Who would you suggest I go with?
---
If you ever need to redo your mutation, just HMU. 
---
I redo mine every other time I play.
---
Yeah that’s it. Took me about 2 months to get ally for them both.
---
You can NW favourite the ghillie outfit but not the new ghillie armour skins.  Naturally, once you put armor on in NW, the ghillie outfit is gone.  If I get marine armour in NW I hot swap between that and the ghillie while I'm moving through bush.
---
I had everything but I was banned on my main, I don't have any other interesting games to play so I'm just trying to get to atleast lvl 50 then buy fo 1st to have my bud give me some junk
---
Is one easier to max out with dailies? Who would you suggest I go with
---
Whoever you want the weapon from most. Faster to get your rep with that side.
---
Slacking behind everyone that's posted so far, I'm 100 score off 17.
---
Ok. I’m halfway done with the raider quest line so I’ll just finish that. Or should I do both sides up until the choice?
---
I think enemy spawns are regulated and pushed back from my experience but I've never built in a hot zone before. 
---
I do know for a fact if you build in random encounter areas however no one will show up. 
---
My camp is north of Sacrament where the "Scientist &amp; Soldier" random encounter occurs (Davenport photo challenge campsite location) and ever since I've built there absolutely no one spawns there. 
---
No traders, no scavengers, no super mutant/ cultist's mass grave etc etc. 
---
Was expecting extra NPCs near my camp. Just have free furniture and ambiance now. 
---
Shame really. 
---
I might be incorrect but I do believe, however, that certain "guaranteed encounters" do continue to spawn.
---
I think that’s the point actually. It’s supposed to be like a bag of cheap plastic army men.
---
You can do both sides quests and finish with one side. That’s what I recommend you do.
---
I sided with the raiders but then split the gold between them both. The dailies are easy to do for them both. When you complete the daily, if you choose the option to not get a reward then that boosts it up a little bit more. Also you can find random places where you can save either settlers or raiders then talk to one of them and it boosts your rep up.
---
Tons of rubberbanding, lag spikes, and today my game crashed at least 10 times. I also have trouble fast traveling, sometimes it takes 8-10 tries before it's successful. I play on PC, it's not my settings, computer, or internet.
---
I had two yao guai just randomly appear out of nowhere and attack me the other day - in the middle of Crater. All the NPCs just went about their daily business like nothing was happening, saying their lines as they passed by me, and I just stood there like... what the actual fuck? It's way beyond jarring, I agree. Doing hardly any damage I could overlook if the difference in levels is that big, but literally not even noticing anything is just dumb.
---
I noticed this today as well.  Went to a different server and it was normal again.  But yes. I have seen this bug numerous times now.  The workshop icon doesn’t display. It is an icon instead. And does not show what resources are available.  And if you own the workshop you have to pay caps to fast travel.
---
From what I gather, your placed foundations are the only thing enemies won't spawn on. It's annoying and a bit silly.
---
No disagreement here. I'm doing it for the door, because apparently I hate myself, because it makes the perfect secret door to the Lair of Mystery and I take a lot of screenshots. But a part of the reason I put it up, aside from just to help others who wanted to maximise the profit and shorten the journey, was as a few people have picked up on to highlight the ludicrous nature of it all. Sure, we can make 10k xp pass like it's nothing; sadly the 'goal' isn't 10k, it's *millions upon millions* of xp broken up into 10k chunks.
---
Realistically, this is a reasonable alt to use when you get the itch to just kill things, and speed along progress a little. Actually trying to seriously grind the ranks is a path to burn out. In fact, I stopped after an hour yesterday, and just did my Daily challenges today, and haven't been able to bring myself to log in again - and I had only been doing it a few days.
---
Do both up until the point of you have to chose which side to do the raid with.
---
I know it use to. Not sure it if it still does. Things change every up date. Lol.
---
So because you don't understand the mechanics they should just be removed? Nice.
---
I'll concede that there's a new bug as of patch 20 that makes Workshops look like normal locations on the map, but that should only affect players unfamiliar with the map. Also, you were only killed once. If you have Lifesaving gear then you were only downed the first time and someone else had to finish the job. At least the penalty for dying while Wanted is typically far LESS severe than it is normally. 
---
Your attitude towards this game is terrible. If there's a mechanic that needs improvement it should get improved, not removed. Otherwise with that attitude we might as well just trash the whole game since just about every area needs improvement.
---
I like your Idea at the end there, but I think it should include 3 piece as well. You could have something like a 3 piece bonus with excavator arms. PA needs something, that's for sure. My carry weight and survivability are way higher wearing 3* legendary normal armor, never even came close even with fully modded PA sets. It's a shame too because I have some neat paints for PA. I'm not going to sacrifice all of my legendary perks (plus mods!) just to wear a badass looking suit of PA.
---
I don't know exactly what they need to do to make PA as worth using as regular armor, but they need to do something. Maybe if we had more perk cards for PA users, set bonuses like you mentioned, perhaps allowing PA to have even just 1 legendary perk, just something needs to change
---
Sutton has Ghouls.
---
Just go to events like the sheepsquatch imposter.. you’ll get loads of opportunities.... pretty much any high level event will give you the opportunity
---
Jesus, that’s some commitment lol
---
I just skipped that one and made up for it with a couple of 10k xp challenges. Killing 3 creatures was easy, but reviving 2 players seemed like a huge waste of time to me
---
Only if you try to claim.
---
Ok. Thanks for the great info!
---
What Overseer Rank do you need to get that one? I'm in no particular rush to get it, but I'd like to have it for Halloween this year
---
Ok. Thanks for the advice. I’ll probably do that to make it a little easier!
---
I don't think I can mention it by name but there is a good trading subreddit where these items are available.  As other peeps have noted, be prepared to offer top tier weapons and armour in exchange.  Trading for these items 'in game' is fraught with risk since the high value attracts scammers.  pm if you want some further advice.
---
It doesn't initiate combat until you try to clame it i once sat on the roof of the ammo plant and claimed it and waited till the guy that took it from me got sick of searching
---
I have this incredible 3* combat shotgun that 1 shots nearly everything in VATS. I do have a perk setup that takes advantage of VATS, shotguns, and chems, so that factors in. I can kill a regular Scorchbeast in 2 hits or 1 crit. I can kill a legendary Scorchbeast in 4-10 hits, depending on # of stars, if they're crits, and distance. I love this thing!
---
So, while the claim or contested flag / meter is rising I'm able to be pvp'd by whoever is contesting/claiming? When that claim/contested part finishes, though, I can't be attacked?
---
There's a matching hat as well for the raider outfit
---
Go read your terms of service....
---
18. Skipped two NW dailies and only gotten the repeatable XP one a couple times, mostly just what I needed for leveling up each day.
---
Auto completion of dailies and weeklies isn't fixed.
---
Sunrise field has a bunch in the pond and with green thumb perk equipped you get even more :)
---
Do you need to have pacifist mode off to fight back in a workshop? I mean, I know you're not safe from getting murdered in a workshop you're trying to claim, but I want to make sure I can fight back without having to turn it on.
---
It's not that the game is difficult. There are certain benefits to being on a team. With these new public teams, it's really easy to group and get quite a bit of extra xp. It reduces the xp grind a great deal.
---
Oh this would be nice synergy for Heavies dude. Also Supersledge could do with some splash damage, melee is so clumsy in this game
---
They should make it a setting in options.
---
So for any weapon/armor you get from (excluding a couple pieces PA, helmets etc.) You have to craft them at a workbenches using legendary modules that can be bought from purveyor murmgher at the rusty pick for 50 scrip each. So say you learned the secret service chest piece you would learn the plan in your inventory go to the rusty pick and buy legendary modules then go to an armor workbench to craft it for random legendary effects. Rinse and repeat until you get a full suit you want
---
A lot of perk slots to use and it’s works weirdly cause of lag
---
I lost 1000 s.c.o.r.e. last night due to this bug and another 1000 the night before.
---
Yes, you can be attacked..... If you take it and kill them. You may be able to claim it. But they can keep attacking over and over. As long as they keep coming back and trying to take it off you.
---
Decided I might just do it at camp cause I could use more crops and wall decorations. 
---
And I tallied it up and it seems to be missing sadly but thanks for letting me know.
---
I won one today too, I got carried but they wouldn’t have won without me
---
I rather farm XP when the NW challenge is not so easy like getting 1 overseer rank or reviving 3 players. Uh... I am rank 104 it takes forever to get 1 rank at this point.
---
No,if its already owned it will instantly make the other player hostile and you both can do damage to each other without both parties doing damage to each other first and you will keep your pacifist status after you came it unless another party tries to clame or reclame the work shop
---
Lol i just wanted the sink
---
Oh Wow, it like my character was meant for this all along.
---
END2 lets you get increase bonus from well fed too, not much but my relish boost goes up to a 25%.
---
People think building is for building as the name says... xD I need to keep reminding people that intel boost xp gain.
---
You learn the plan, buy legendary modules for script, then craft the weapon. It will always be legendary. You can't get non legendary versions.
---
Ha, it would not even let me fast travel there at all.  i get the notice for "Prepare your defenses" but then i get "You cannot fast travel to a workshop you do not own".  annoying, but the next server was fine.
---
I had my camp in the same spot since the game has been released. Enemy spawns do not go away. I would know since I get attacked by 4 max lvl frogs everyone I log in or travel to base.
---
Idm since they drop caps junk and xp.
---
Ok thanks
---
Not unless they patched her today as it was working yesterday...or so I heard *cough*
---
They patched her spawn location.
---
Hoped that helped
---
You can kiss my ass with the charisma bs also no i will not run max blocker because i prefer a challenge
---
The good thing about aaronholt though is the only enemies you may have to worry about are low level insects for the most part so its super easy to harvest
---
41 and thats it now i have to go away for 3 weeks :(
---
I think there's meant to be a hat too, but as I sided (or rather used) Foundation to get the gold I can't confirm and can barely find any info elsewhere. I did find a short YouTube clip though : https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4cPNJNlYPR4
---
i mean it shares all the other mods so...
---
I had 30 minutes left before the challenge expired and my team lasted the whole round. I actually got pretty into it! I finally was a credit to team and revived my guy getting the challenge, then my game disconnected me before the conclusion which was a big buzz kill. But hey, I got score!
---
Great, thank you!
---
Congrats!! 
---
Just reached 16 today. I haven't been grinding as much but that'll change soon lol
---
13 but I've missed at least four days so far.
---
if they at least produced some fixer skins i wouldn’t mind... but there’s nada
---
Your welcome have a nice day
---
It should give the person you are throwing it at rads.with glowing goo on ymthe inside.
---
How long did it take you to get the 14k xp? I'm awful at pvp and even worse at NW so I try hiding...
---
Rank 14
---
I thought the acid damage works per shot, so something like a 10mm SMG or Minigun could perhaps mor than double their dmg output - over 4 seconds of course, so no benefit to instakill, but big enemies should drain rather fast also because most enemies don't have poison resistance.

if you space it right you can get the little antenna to stick through a flat roof, then you can make it its own little shack with no doors or windows and not have to mess with conduit baloney
---
I've already quit playing for now. Back when I could get 20-50 Atoms a day from casual play, I felt like it was worth it. Now all it does is make me frustrated when I log in.
---
What rank did it unlock? I just hit 11 earlier. I’ve gotten the Christmas stuff and a few Halloween.
---
Alongside with the survival outfit, so close to that antler chandelier
---
I'll check back when I get off work. If no one has you covered I can do it.
---
Alrighty, thanks :)

you get the moth dance and the robot shuffle with just a month and best part is you keep it even if you dont keep 1st
---
A month gets it and you keep it forever.

Some time ago I visited a players CAMP and they had this sad little xmas tree with 2 x decorations on what was basically a abranch stuck in a car tyre. I laughed when i saw it because that sums up perfectly how I feel about xmas. Anyway roll on to when the season stats and I jump into NW and to my absolute delight I ended up unlocking that tree among some other cheesy decorations. So Im set if I never manage to unlock anything else. I dont see myself getting enough xp before tuesday to unlock the skeleton costume anyway. Whatever I get from here will be a bonus I wasnt expecting
---
Took a couple hours non consecutive for myself.
---
Except metal has higher DR and leather has higher ER but it is overall the best all rounded armor in the game.
---
There was always a daily NW challenge, but now it does feel more forced. People are either stressing that they won't make enough SCORE or far too eager to get ALL OF IT NOW NOW NOW.  
---
So, yes, there's going to be a lot more people just doing the daily and nothing more to further compound the issues in NW.... Yay...
---
Unless people gety different daily challenges, today's build challenge was for walls, floors and roofs... not crops and doors
---
Nice thank you, also do think fallout 1st is worth getting yearly I am a returning player don't know much of this new stuff
---
Thank you👍
---
It's not ranked based.  It is off Overseer XP earned.
---
How can you see how much you have gained, like total amount?
---
We're gonna get bugs either way, so they might as well *try* to put in some stuff that benefits the player.
---
Look at your score and rank do some math and you will find out if you got it or not. Don’t forget score increases by 25 each rank.
---
We have two months left to do this. Cool your jets. Anyone can very easily reach Rank 10 the first day if they put in a little effort.
---
I'm only rank 7 right now. Those 2 challenges should ha e put me up 2 ranks
---
That’s a laser gun mod, forget which one. That’s pretty bad right there, sorry you ran into him
---
Oh I see! That is quite helpful and convenient considering I'm actually starting to get a lot of scrip as of late.
---
On the topic of armor, there are no descriptions of any for what I have available (one below full rank on foundation and whats available for the secret service) so I gotta ask while I am here, what are some of the different armor options? Like what makes them different from eachother?
---
Murgh the Purveyor. Your best chance is to have an ordinary fixer on you when you go.
---
I have a bug where the foundation daily quest says i automatically have the item and i can just go up to ward and turn it in without actually having to do anything
---
Awesome man. Looks good. You've given me hope!
---
That doesn’t help me much. How many daily’s did you do? Did you do a part of the weekly overtime? How many days did you play.
---
That absolutely will not happen because you unlock the rewards as you go along. When you rank up, you rank up. There is no question about it and you automatically receive the rewards when you choose to unlock them on the game board.
---
Thanks... Much appreciated
---
like 3 days of on and off casual play (hiding in a bush) ((EVERY game)) I got from 0 xp to ghillie suit idk if that's 14k but has to be pretty close
---
Yep that’s legit possible. Video from Captainnoob: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=TEMRRaHIaU4
---
Well I did all of the dailies today, and completed 3 of the weeklies today. 2 of the 3 weeklies didn't pay out. My score didn't move. I'm currently sitting at 1075, I needed 1175. The 2 weeklies should have paid out 1000 each, inshould have gained 2 ranks. My meter didn't go up though.
---
There's a couple of builds able to do this. What people should do is allow everyone to do some damage and then go imba on it, not just insta kill it because you can. But people like to be tests and feel superior or flex.  
---
Grouping up with the imba dudes allows you to get loot too, though.
---
You can't.  During the actual events you could see the progress you had made leading up to each reward.
---
Yes I was playing during the reset, I was fighting through Harpers Ferry when one of my friends told me the daily challenges had reset. When I checked all were completed apart from kill 10 Mole Miners and the NW challenge.

My friends and I have been playing through the reset since the Legendary run started, this is the only time they have auto completed on me. Never had a problem with the daily atom challenges before this.
---
Mine has VATs critical go +50%, which I am happy about. I’m going to try using it exclusively for a few days to get the feel of it.
---
Ah, thank you for the info
---
Yeah, I picked the wrong group for that though. Sucks though they didn’t wait till everyone got their damage requirement
---
You did not specify how many days you completed with the daily’s so I will assume this is your first day. 
---
3 weekly would be 3000 or 3500
---
All daily is 2000.
---
5k~ would knock you up to rank 6.
---
I've played 3 days total for the weekly.
---
When tatos expire thay should be able to be thrown and leave a red splash mark this would make so much fun
---
Thats normal
---
😂😂😂 seriously not trying to be rude but you had me so confused. Boolean is a type of math. Bullion is the spelling you're looking for. I thought I was missing a large part of the game. Thanks for the midnight chuckle and good luck grinding 😁👍
---
My buddy says something about the NE file bc Beth is trash at filing ypu have to delete a couple of lines and make some
---
No problem. But you need real god rolls to do this. I’m not sure but I believe he uses a B2525 Fixer
---
yeah agree, 1 or 2 weeks more time to finish would be enough, also for people that dont have much time to play or might be in vacation for a week so they still can obtain these things.
---
Yeah I remember in fallout 3 having the metal blaster do about 1k damage outside of vats if I got a critical, it was pretty sweet.
---
Of course the other tip is to get yourself a 'broken' heavy gun and join in on the melting. You don't even need the correct build for those, just need to get in the queen's face for a bit.
---
75 score shy from 18.
---
Honestly the chances of getting one are slim even if you do have  1000 scrip
---
3 simple steps for dat sort of players:
---
1. REPORT
---
2. BLOCK
---
3. Forget about him
---
I think they may have stacked the deck in our favor today, because I didn't see a single creature in the 10 or so matches it took me yesterday to get 2 revives, but I was able to find and kill a radscorpion in the first 2 minutes of my first match, and another radscorpion and a bloatfly in about the same time in my second match.

---
A few comments down they said they found a fix
---
Ah christ lmao, yeah you're right. I checked my quest guide and realised that 12 AM brain hit harder than I expected. If you didn't say anything I wouldn't have ever noticed.
---
Pc user. Lag, good ol fashion rubber banding (which was hilarious the first 10 times now it is annoying), corpses that refuse to stay dead,
---
And headless corpses
---
Deathclaw island, kill, server hop, kill. Should get one eventually. They drop them now.
---
Pardon my ignorance, but I can’t tell by the still here what’s riding on your nerves exactly. Is that gun glitched somehow?
---
What I downloaded it a couple of weeks ago in the App Store and it works just fine
---
Looking for his medical scanner no doubt!
---
I have had a few people do it to me. Just drop in and stand about expecting a reward. And then the total opposite. Be a meat shield and get nothing because you didnt do enough damage. They need to do a progression bar or something.
---
I saw him in a nuclear winter match earlier today, he shot me in a bush.
---
I was in the radius of a contested workshop and was killed multiple times even though I was not the owner or trying to take over. I was very confused because I didnt think that was how it worked...
---
This is why I think Bear Arms is a must-have perk for Heavy builds - the 90% heavy gun weight reduction means I can schlepp around a whole arsenal - one gun for each ammo type. So I use a gatling plasma or gatling laser for longer fights like SBQ or Encryptid. I have a gatling gun for trash mobs because it has the best ammo economy of all heavy guns. I pull out a .50 cal or LMG when and if I have enough ammo to use it for a while.
---
I've contemplated crafting a plasma caster and gauss minigun to spread the load around to even more ammo types, but their ammo drops so rarely that I don't feel it's worth it.
---
I also pour all the gunpowder, lead and steel I find into 5mm and .50 ammo. With this approach, I've never yet come even close to running out of ammo, even with all the XP farming I'm doing for SCORE.
---
I’ve soloed him twice in the forest near the queen as no one turned up for help despite calling out. I was lucky both times as the bad guy was just stuck between trees and didn’t react to my ultracite Gatling laser (took just 2-3 cores)
---
I have the same setup, you have to edit your ini file.
---
not for me personally, because i am capricious. it's definitely worth it for one month to see if you like it. i got it because i got laid off from my job and mainly wanted it to facilitate trading items across characters. i only planned on having it for a month but now i've had it two.
---
I’m a bloodied build but I have a set of power armor with a medic pump specifically for encryptid. I get rid of my rads and just tank all 3 pylons and then just keep a safe distance from the imposter and pop it a couple times to get the legendary.
---
I love VATS in 76, but replaying 4 I am hating VATS that I used to like. I hate the slowing time and shots being planned rather than taking effect the moment you pull the trigger.
---
I won’t try to change your mind because I 100% agree with you.
---
Ok thank you
---
documents - mygames - fallout76 - fallout76Prefs
---
Change to iPresentInterval=0 then save. 
---
Should be fixed. Game has an FPS lock that sucks
---
Strange. Glowing steaks + bear ribs + dog chops make my non bloodied meele build hit 600+ dmg with miner gauntlet
---
It's a handmade rifle with a lazer gun muzzle that fucking shoots flames.
---
20, at what stage should we be to complete on time?
---
I did all but 1 daily, and completed 4 weekly challenges. I did the math, my score should be 7500, I should be at rank 8. So something didn't go through. I could be wrong.
---
But why?
---
I think there might be an issue with pure unarmed, it doesn't seem to register with bare hands or with PA hands. It used to before this patch, but now it's just all...messy.
---
I just did the quest and sided with the settlers. I didn't get a stealth suit. did I miss something or do something wrong?
---
Not sure why people bother... the adds are where the money (xp) is..
---
Tent?
---
Agreed
---
Take pleasant valley claim tickets to the claim ticket robot in the basement of that pleasant valley resort and get free western outfits. I think it is crazy these sell for so much. Scorched always drop tickets and it is not rare to get the western outfits. When I have like 6-8 tickets I’ll go by, turn them all in, and leave with at least two or three western outfits.
---
i'm literally on top of a blood eagle spawn (i was there before them) and they will spawn sometime even IN the foundation block where you can't shoot them. fast travel away and back fixes it. they make a lot of noise but only ever wreck some crops. i do not know if it prevents random encounters. if you mean https://i.imgur.com/ID0ergG.jpg these random encouters, i don't think it will let you build on them
---
Next.
---
I go to Ohio River adventures and pick up the life preservers
---
That's hard to do for events that aren't on a fixed timer - how do you judge how long the SBQ has still to live? I would love to see more consistent timers for activating events - for some it's 10 minutes, for others it seems to be up to 30? Standardize this to 10 minutes, and then "event has been active for x minutes", together with the info on the number of active players at an event  should give you a reasonably good indication if this is still worth traveling to.
---
The stacks of cups also give plastic.
---
Do you think they were planning a Christmas in July event that someone forgot to disable? Or am employee snuck it in cuz they felt bad for some of the other bugs?
---
Cigarette packs and cartons. I'd wager half of my plastic comes from those.
---
Personally, i'm only saving half my lunchboxes. We don't exactly know if next weekly challenges will include repeatable xp gain for score points.
---
Also the top floor of Fort Defiance has 2 tables set with plastic plates and utensils.
---
I also throw in a bunch of Halloween Candy just because it is fun.
---
I still rock the raider beenie with the ear muffs, looks dope with the treasure hunter outfit
---
Suit or skin for armor? The latter is part of S.C.O.R.E., go get it!
---
Yes you can still get it. They brought back the previous challenges for some reason.
---
It’s a cosmetic. Like ALL headwear is.
---
If you think 1650 is too much for a cosmetic just don’t buy it. Problem solved.
---
I guess it would be nice, this, to me at least, is waaaaaaay down the priority wishlist. It takes but two minutes to launch and load into a server. Is is really that painful?
---
Better question is why do some people have 3 or 4 fusion generators? Holy mothman that's overkill.
---
How can you test thing?  Angry Turtle (a FO76 genius) tested this and said Lone Wanderer does NOT work in groups, even if you are in a team solo LW turns off.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqwoKVJQ46A&amp;t=632s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqwoKVJQ46A&amp;t=632s)
---
Is that still going? I want that glowing skele costume lol
---
Learning the plans for gold bullion items not only allows you to craft them as random legendaries, using legendary modules you can buy for scrip from the purveyor, it also unlocks them to drop from events and from the random weapon and armor boxes you buy from the purveyor. Due to the ridiculously huge drop pool for legendary items, your best bet is to craft them, though.
---
Yes. It's experience based though and the challenges aren't tracked so you just gotta keep going and pay attention to what you unlock.
---
Of course they can, because they still have the Weeklies and the early ranks are short. Goes without saying really. I'm not really sure what your point is?
---
That's a disconcertingly good point.
---
isnt, and never was.
---
Grenade hopping? I'm not sure I'm familiar with that.
---
Thanks I'll remember that for next time theres an easy nw challenge
---
Me too. I  disliked it so much back then.
---
Thanks :)
---
Its easy, have a buddy shoot you, and you equip and un equip lone wanderer and have them report the numbers. Ive tested this with about a half dozen different people.
---
I've still got 3 dailies to today, i am currently  175 score from rank 23, depending on how I am feeling I might try grind 100k tonight to hit rank 24 after finishing my dailies.
---
I earned the survivors bow yesterday, is that why? If so, does that mean I’m close?
---
I believe if you do every daily, and get 1 repeatable ×100 from the weekly you're golden, 100% guaranteed.
---
That is not including double xp/score weekends or other changes.
---
No offense, but how many camps do i have to look at that all look the same.  They only gave us the bare minimum to build with, and no mods, no clutter... so basically, photos and videos people share of their "awesome new camp" just all bleed together.  Now, granted... there are some camp builds that are quite unique, but the moment they get shared, there are a dozen of those camps because people just copy that one, or two new and cool ways to kind of get around how awful, because lets face it... their awful, the building mechanics in 76.  Like, if you like to build camps, you should be building settlements in Fallout 4 w/ mods, and sharing that with the Fallout 4 community, who loves to share their builds and concepts and mods.  /2¢
---
Those cars are so unstable, a bullet can get them off.  Just plug the coolant line and watch it blow up into a mushroom cloud.
---
u can play solo in ur team and still have all bufs.
---
Its possible the user had stacked their tent with the default skin and then changed it back to raider so when they relogged it changed.
---
I haven’t even unlocked the Fixer yet, been waiting on my brother for that
---
But yeah, I feel like I need me a bloodied heavy, I already love how much damage I do with a bloodied baseball bat
---
it does.
---
Hoping I get a good heavy roll from Purveyor when the sale is up
---
They count.
---
You have to stay in a team for at least a minute, though.
---
Mine was set to build:
---
-Wall/Floor decorations
---
-Walls, floors and ceilings
---
-Crops or water harvesters 
---
-Doors and stairs 
---
-Containers and display cases
---
Test it out for us.
---
Find two level 20 super mutants. Let one hit you with both effects on.
---
The other just weapon.
---
Science!
---
yeah. not so many got this yet, i have almost all serums for sale and the best seller is marsupial or speed demon (demonio veloz in spanish)
---
I think you're wrong, this bug has already been acknowledged by bethesda, but they have confirmed that they are paying out, just early, not at 5/5. Am yet to see anyone give evidence to suggest otherwise.
---
So I need to grind for bloodied and unyielding items, to be able to grind new character to whatever required level to be able to grind XP to be able to grind SCORE. 
---
Man, this game is amazing.
---
it's the bash damage, but no one seems to no why...
---
I was surprised when I got that little tree too. It is now sitting in the front room of my camp.
---
How long do party favors last?
---
What a pain... but i guess i can't complain, at least i can unlock it after having missed it originally
---
Hmm I feel like I have this bug also. what rank are you at now? I still feel like I didnt get my score cuz I'm only at rank 13 and I think only missed like 2-3 dailies and I want to kind of compare what others ranks are if they did finish the weeklies.
---
I can do about 100k a day, for me that's 5 hrs with dropping off scrap/legendaries/maintenance. Good on you for grinding!
---
Thanks. I assumed, quite sensibly I might add, that bash damage would only apply for melee. Maybe it applies just because you are in melee range. That is really odd. Also the damage seems to be higher than 40% so it's like it's multiplying with the perks.
---
Oh wow
---
I skipped the first 2 days but have started doing NW for it. It's different!
---
Are yellow numbers crits?
---
If so i get it outside VATS. Often with handmade.
---
It scales based on how many people take part in the event
---
It's a good idea.
---
Which is why we won't see it happen, ever. (They might stick it on the eternal promise list for 1st though.)
---
I find Generation Zero to be pretty reminiscent. No base building, but weapons (pistols, shotguns, rifles, assault rifles, rocket launchers, no melee) of varying quality and rarity, weapon mods have rarity too (gold level silencers, scopes, extended mags for example) Ammo and cosmetic outfit scavenging, some outfit pieces offer buffs, different ammo is more effective against or weak points. Safe houses have stash boxes because you have a weight limit. Skill trees focused around healers, hackers or solo play etc. Four player co-op I believe. Large map with missions, collectibles, side quests. It’s from the studio who made Just Cause and I’m not sure it did very well, so you could probably find it for cheap. It’s similar in its awkwardness and gunplay, some of the combat can be annoying and have you spamming healing items, there weren’t human NPC’s until the recent DLC same as F76, but stick with it and it can be pretty fun.
---
Word.
---
Also, the explosive frame breaks all sights if you log out and back in. Crossbow has so much work still to be done.
---
I would say the coolest things about it are the private server, unlimited scrap and the ranger armor, the atoms are cool too. However there are some moments where I'm like, why am I paying for this?
---
Do you not have a mic available?  All you have to do is join a lobby and ask your group if anyone needs to get the challenge done.  I instantly had two people in my group speak up and we took turns running into the fire and we were done with the challenge before the circle even started moving.
---
Indeed, ideally you'll already have the gear spread across different characters, or the Script to drop on rolling 1-Stars until you get something close to servicable/caps to guy the first cheap 1-Star Unyielding pieces you find on someones vendor, but it's fair bit of work if you are starting from scratch.
---
Such a common sense thing.
---
Except, yeah the game is probably just flat out not capable of doing it, and fixing that would be too much of a hurdle.
---
I hope no one hates me for this but for me it's worth it. I like some atom shop purchases like for building and cosmetic weapons so having the 1600 atoms with the purchase of 12.99 a month is worth it. Plus having to be able to keep all your junk separate and not take up stash weight is great. Junk took up almost half my stash. I'm the kind of person who hoards everything. I just wish the scrap box was not character bound so my other characters can use them for building.
---
I only sell fusion cores if there's spare space in inventory.
---
That 3 weight in stash is a pain.
---
Try attaching posts to the edge of all the stacked foundations and then try and delete the top one
---
Anyone that complains about NW dailies now wasn't trying to do the challenges when the mode first came out.  This shit is easy compared to being asked to win a match or launch three nukes.
---
Just got home from work. Still need a hand?
---
Yeah, thanks
---
Thing i love most is when im overweight i jus slap a tent down and stash my loot and carry on with my game
---
So, does Class Freak completely negate the -2 to all stats when solo? I see the benefits when in a team, absolitely; does Herd Mentality proc even when in a public team but still playing solo? Wanna make sure it's worth the investment before I go out and snag the plan/buy a serum.
---
I only recently joined fallout 1st... and I joined just after BETA. I was reluctant to pay for it.  But my stash was always full, and with the vendors in play, I only could sell limited items. The atoms I wasn't too fussed about either.  My friends say just try it for a month, and see what u think.  I did so... And the second month I paid for the year.  Best thing I did for the game.
---
my vendor
---
Precisely
---
Worked for me too. I got it yesterday
---
&gt; Bottom text
---
No problems. I'll take all my armour off and die to the deathclaw at deathclaw island in the shallow water. I've done it like this a few times and it seems to work the easiest
---
Not worth legacy.
---
Alright
---
I won a couple by just gunning and running. I really didn't care because I was only doing it for the challenges. My favorite weapon I guess would be a simple hunting rifle with a scope.
---
I'm on Xbox too, I'm looking forward to it :)
---
PC players will play together whether they use the Bethesda launcher, Windows, or Steam
---
Thing is if it does get buffed alot of people that pvp will get mad because its almost impossible to take down and then it will get nerfed to where the stats are even worse than before the buff
---
OK Google, define Griefing:
---
"Griefer. From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. A griefer or bad faith player is a player in a multiplayer video game who deliberately irritates and harasses other players within the game (trolling), using aspects of the game in unintended ways."
---
&gt;using aspects of the game in unintended ways.
---
It is completely intended that the nuke can be dropped where your camp is. 
---
Maybe Google it yourself before telling people they need to Google it.
---
Try it for a month, stuff insane amount of stuff into your scrap box, if you don't like to keep the sub, just drop it and enjoy your scrap box.
---
Building = Minor xp buff for EVERYTHING you do. Picking this would be best for most situations imo.
---
Events = Pick this if you plan to do ONLY event.
---
Sounds good
---
All good?
---
Vats shotgun is broken, the damage is crazy, that's why.
---
I have a BE combat shotty and I couldn't one shot everything before this bug, though mostly it still one shots stuff.
---
Yeah, thanks for that - I can finally get more carry weight for my hoarding needs
---
The bash damage legendary effect - along with several others - has been bugged for a few months now. On shotguns - especially in VATS - and on weapons with an effective rate of fire &gt; 200 it triggers a bugged version of the Furious effect, so the gun does insane amounts of damage. Such weapons are often called "magic".
---
Enjoy! Hey - have you got the Blue ridge caravan backpack skin? I've got a spare and will give it to you
---
While we are making good sense requests that we wont ever get, Id love the ability to track map events and have them pop up when theyre available. Like public events do but we could pick and choose the smaller events. Daily ones as well when its time for them. 
---
I like doing leader of the pack or distant thunder but it would be nice to not have to navigate to the map every ten minutes to see what event is up.
---
Hear me out sir. Grape peel, pumpkin innards, endurian taste, banana shape
---
Bufftatts, Pyschotatts seem to sell very well.  They may sit a while but when someone buys they usually clear it all out.
---
I'm always buying these too now for around 35 caps.  
---
Flavoured mentats too but I now keep onto these.
---
I do this trick so I can build in the water. It's such an annoying bug that should have been fixed by now. Best advice I have to avoid it or workaround is to make the stairs the first thing you build so if you have that happen then you don't lose progress
---
I appreciate the advice. I tried this but unfortunately it did not work. I think I am going to call it a night and I think I am just going to have to rebuild tomorrow. 
---
Sorry for the frustrated post but it is really disheartening to have something you worked so hard on fall apart to something so trivial.
---
Thanks o totally forgot about the files I'll try this as soon as I get home
---
This is good advice, thank you.
---
Delete this &gt;:P
---
I lost 3000+, i'm sorry. Asked Bethesda support 3 times:
---
You will be greet by phrases like "we cannot restore your score or compensate with atoms, It wouldn't be right to other players" as happened with me
---
Same day i was told this shit I got rank 35 for "personal compensation".  
---
I do my own compensation.

Thanks for the skin
---
No worries. Catch you around the wastelands!
---
THat belongs on a private server. Very crap for everyone else at a PUBLIC event. Seen it often this weekend.  
---
Please do not flex your OP weapons at violent night, uranium fever etc. Lower level players at public events would like some fun too.
---
It's a proper jack ass move to one shot legendary enemies when there are 6 other low level people in the event.
---
Hey remember they said they fixed 1000+ bugs in Wastelanders.
---
1000 light bulbs I guess.
---
Its true the raider daily works but I don't have to do anything for the foundation one I just go up to ward a d get the rewards
---
As an immersion scientist I can say that this is not immersive. To truly be immersive you would never move your camp and never use other stash boxes.
---
since you can nuke monogah mine in NW, does that mean you can do a colossal problem in NW?
---
Lol yeah it is same for me but this is the kind of bug Bethesda usually decides it needs to fix ASAP since it benefits us hehe
---
I started playing again when wastelanders dropped, having spent a grand total of about 27 dollars on the game back at release, about 4 days in I decided to spend some money on first, both for the atoms and for the tent and scrapbox, its now been near on 3 months and I'm still subscribing, I personally think its worth it, without it, I would probably want to buy atoms to buy some of the cool cosmetics, but because I get 1650 atoms with first + those I earn ingame, I haven't felt the need.   
---
Its definitely worth it if you can afford it, if you're tossing up on the cost because it means you miss out on something else each month, then don't do it.
---
Also store as much as you can in the scrap box! Even if your membership expires, all your junk stays in the scrapbox. You just can't add any more junk into the scrap box.
---
grind grind grind. daily's. don't forget photo op, slocum joes, mirelurk meet etc
---
I used LOCKDOWN.
---
They did fix a common bug i had where only my melee damage registered if I shot something their health bar would just fill right back up
---
It gets even weirder: if you are wearing chest armor with "reduces damage while blocking", you can apply magic effect to nonmagic shotguns and the flechette harpoon gun
---
The scrapbox tent are a massive help as you can ditch your junk almost anywhere and always have a place to cook or sleep without having to go home. If you're in to atom store stuff then the sub pays for itself. Private worlds are also great as they provide a slightly less risky way of transferring items between toons ( still some risk though ), make workshops risk free for challenges and fusion core farming ( don't bother trying to farm anything else though, they're more hassle than they are worth ) and if you're levelling a toon you can do most the quests without high level mobs murdering you because someone else has been in the area.
---
Anti armor / armor penetration effects in this game are multiplicative, not additive. Meaning more you add, less effective it gets. For example AA + Perforating magazine and tank killer perk is not 126% penetration but 80.80%. You can play around with this calculator to see the damage effects on high DR targets when using armor penetrations.  [https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html)
---
Maybe weight reductions. Arguably other prefixes. These are trade offs for the rad resistance of course. You could stack chameleon pieces and even go further by using chameleon sneak pieces. Just really depends on how you want to do it.
---
Thanks. Bit of a shame because I incorrectly believed that the shotgun was really powerful. I thought it seemed reasonably balanced because I had to be up close and I couldn't do much damage to the SBQ but yet solo I could do a lot of damage and on very powerful enemies it certainly does not one shot them. As I level I might save up my points and then decide later on whether to switch builds or not since I just put so much into shotguns right now. The non-bugged explosive shotgun is ok but there isn't enough reward for being up close compared to all those people in power armor and a heavy gun or stealth rifle.
---
I used the  sword for so long. I loved the idea of killing ghouls with a tai chi sword
---
Il no expert but it’s the only Armor I’ve used so far. I think other sets can be as stealthy but none can sneak right past enemies like it. I use it every time for silo runs and SBQ events and hardly have to fire.
---
You play on XBox right? I might have a spare fixer plan and a spare bloodied Gatling laser if you want
---
in a literal sense to since it uses the exact same model.
---
likewise ultracite laser and gatling should also allow laser and gatling laser skins.
---
Tried that. Nada. I will try again thanks.
---
Ricochet / blocker / Lone wanderer if alone are enough to make you ignore most bullets, and if one is supposed to hurt a bit more, there's a lot of chance it get deflected by ricochet ( Hi Gutsy bot ... )
---
I was expecting a chill gameplay, but Bethesda is like: “do you want to see some real speed!!?”
---
Thanks for posting this. Now I can know how far I am behind. It’s not looking good haha
---
Thanks that's good to know. I don't think we have a conclusive reason why this is happening, but it's all around the reset time these issues have started.
---
He hasn’t blessed us yet
---
You could also set yourself up as a freelancer. Score two to three jobs, and afford to buy your way to the end in about 12-hours.
---
Well I guess I can just stop trying now..... having 4 days in a row auto completing im already far behind.
---
They were bundles for special events that was going on in real life. They have been only 3 that I can remember. One gave the mechanist costume, one gave a general's coat, one gave the pint size slashers costume. The events were quakecon, E3, and VGA's (not too sure on that last one)
---
Corvid-19 happened and all them events got cancelled
---
Interesting, 'cause I've been selling all serums for quite a while (my price is 349c per piece) and herd mentality was always one of the best-sellers.
---
damn relax my guy holy shit lol. did you watch the video? I feel like it's a pretty unique build compared to vast majority of other player camps...and even if it wasn't, you gotta chill out, maybe take another break from this sub+game you clearly don't enjoy. sorry my house got you so hot and bothered, maybe I should've just posted more complaints about the game.
---
would it be worth the swap bloodly mess for ricochet?
---
You can’t purchase levels until the season has been out for 2 weeks. They have used glitches to gain XP in order to get to rank 100
---
&gt;Completing all weekly Quests gives you 6500.
---
Should be 7500. 
---
Other that this is good if you're planning on splitting it exactly into the same amount of SCORE each day. Thanks.
---
Quick question, but we're you performing this using a gamepad or mouse and keyboard? This would affect your times, as I found with my gamepad and just spamming the A button is pretty quick, where I imagine if you use the mouse or keyboard it would take longer and might be more cumbersome.
---
I have five, but that guarantees me to have 1400 caps daily. Others prefer to decorate their camp. I go to the practical.
---
That's pretty ridiculous. Not to mention some don't want to bother with NW, so that's even worse. I don't think the double score event would make it up.
---
I’m ok with getting both of those eventually on my own, thank you for the offer though!
---
They are exploiting and I'm pretty sure Bethesda won't do anything about it. No reason not to exploit at this point. Better than paying Todd 150 atoms per rank imo
---
I've never seen anyone with the Pint-Size Slasher costume or the Mechanist one...
---
I remember the Elders Battlecoat one.
---
How long ago were the first 2?
---
Ok no problem. Then I wish you good luck and may RNGesus be with you. Have a good one :)
---
I often do that yep, you may need to swap only while fighting strong ranged units, maybe the incoming Wendigo boss will require such swap
---
Ah nice. I expect PC to gain a few thousand players too then.
---
Just a quick reminder that there is more to gaming than min/maxing, and you should **play however the hell you like to!**
---
I personally don't like Power Armor, and if it received an overwhelming buff and became a clear best-in-slot, I still wouldn't play it. I'm playing for enjoyment, not maximising output and efficiency - that's what I go to work and get pad for 🤷‍♂️
---
you picked up one of the quest items that wasn't your specific daily item, so now you have a spare sitting in your misc. tab, so when the daily rolls over it triggers the turn in, but when you do he doesn't take the item allowing you to just keep handing it in. 
---
so as much as this is a bug, its one of the good bugs, but good bugs are the only bugs they actually fix, so don't tell bethesda for the love of god.
---
Or just use this  [https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/score.html?](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/score.html?)
---
Theyre using a glitch that involves leader bobble heads and the recent "fixed" invincibility glitch with energy weaps. Idk the specifics but ik it involves like 10k leader bobbleheads and some dirty water
---
absolutely, because bloodied builds have a lot of dmg, you can sacrifice all dmg cards.
---
I only remember about 3 of them. I don't think they were supposed to be a regular thing.
---
If you're going bloodied then the AGI points boost trumps the stealth suit for sneaking. If not, I don't think you can get stealthier than it but you can get close with high agi, sneak perks and harder to detect pieces, which would then give you access to other legendary armour effects. 
---
Similar reasoning to why many don't use power armour. PA has best damage reduction, but no legendary effects.
---
You need to do the Freestates quests.
---
The chill gameplay is still an option, you just dont get the same rewards as the try hards.
---
It's honestly not that hard to attain! It takes me 30 mins or less to complete my dailies as they are all relatively simple challenges. Within an hour or so of playing i can complete the repeatable several times, especially when taking advantage of other XP buffs that are easily accessible.
---
How do I get that quest?
---
Kewl thanks for explaining how the bug happened take a up doot dont worry god Howard will never find out
---
thank you for clearing that up.
---
Dam I'm sorry dude, if you're on PC I can try and lend a hand, I feel like I'm good at finding creative workarounds while fighting the building system haha
---
That being said, I gotta finish my base first, and collecting all the wood and concrete I need has been a bitch lmao
---
I did SBQ on my level 30 yesterday. Was surprised that I did enough damage to be able to loot it, particularly since I was a melee build so I had to get up close and personal. No complaints, though. Got a useless legendary from it! 
---
That was, to be honest, the most fun I have had in the game in a while.
---
Well, that's just a massive oopsie, because that represents 100,000 exp from the repeatable challenges, and these calculations rely on you completing 16 of them every week. Quick maths would say that now you only have to complete it 6 times a week whilst completing all the Daily and Weekly challenges. Additionally, it costs 200,000 exp to make up for any missed days.
---
Lucky them! I have levelled up to 5, yet the little board game won’t move past 1 and unlock anything (despite the XP bar saying I’m level 5)
---
I saw 2 people with captain cosmos suits and backpack (ps4) on day 2 and asked this myself.
---
I unsubscribed as a protest for Bethesda allowing all the duping. Which led to us not having vending for 2+ weeks. Which is the main reason I play. Well it took me all of about 3 days without the scrap box to resub. Bottom line, if I’m going to continue to play, I can’t see doing it without FO First.
---
It needs to be community based - can't see why that would make the radar in light of other concerns.
---
There's people  - mostly one - that upload the daily challenges on the  RDO sub; I'd kinda been wanting to try the same thing here, but because of RL stuff I've held back in case I couldn't be consistent with timely posts.
---
Do you know if body guard works with pub teams and/or if lone wanderer is effected by pub teams
---
But its nice to know about why power armor its so bad.
---
 I think a lot of players dont even know it, like players use event group +100% xp thinking they have more xp than building group....
---
You too :)
---
Are you on pc?
---
So long as you are in a team, even if you are by yourself, it gives you the +2. It's great. Really no reason not to use it.
---
#Immersion scientist
---
Power armor has an additional 40% damage reduction in addition to the 400 DR, that you can't get with regular armor, and works with drug and food effects 
---
Plus stabilized provides extra armor penetration with heavy weapons, I don't think I've seen anyone with a heavy weapons build not use power armor 
---
Ya it's not the best for every build tho, would make no sense for a power armor sneak pistol build, unless it's just for the lulz
---
How does it guarantee you those caps?
---
The only thing I can think of the crossbow having over the bow is the fact that you don't need to "charge" the weapon. Then again, this advantage is offset by the crossbow being slower to reload so.
---
Just a tip if you are planning on buying levels wait till the end of the season. They cost the same per level however the XP requirement goes up with each level so you will get more bang for your buck.
---
If it work as intended, Lone wanderer is inactive during puplic team, might have to try, bodyguard is a decent card to replace lone wanderer when in group indeed ( if someone share Strnage in numbers )
---
That’s great you had a fun experience with it, reminds me that the one I had is just going to be a small memory compared to the other successful fun attempts and future ones
---
This one's available on console as well
---
everyone makes his on decision. i dont do things just because everyone does it. i dont want to cheat, i dont want to use exploits. call me naive but thats the way i like to play.
---
What about the 4 days of double score coming up and the 4 days of double xp before that?
---
I removed 500 units of space from my stash into the scrapbox. That alone was satisfying, except i have grinded a bit of legendaries and filled it again because of the scrip limit. If i could have a cheaper first like 5eur for only the scrapbox, i dont need the rest although the tent is nice to have (i placed mine near raider camp at the crater)
---
20 of 100 is still only about 10% of the points you would need to reach 100, seeing as how the requirement increases each level. Yes, they're barely on track, but only because they have been grinding their ass off to make up for the deficit. They may not be behind in progress, but they're definitely behind in the amount of reward they have gotten relative to the amount they deserve.
---
also You can check in game options if the game runs in fullscreen, windowed mode has poor fps on my AMD card
---
Oh don't worry i only planned on buying it at end of season if i was shy of completion, it totally defeats the purpose to pay for it all, it's free unlocks for playing and achieving things. But hey, if others want to spend money, more power to them.
---
Omfg finally my I can dust off my ancient poon
---
I've been naive so far but this one actually cost lots of time. I'd rather exploit and spend time with my family. I don't get penalized for it what's stopping me?
---
I'd like one that says "Sorry for being a one shot wanker, that one was an accident"
---
Do you mean the Halloween skins? I’m so excited. (And I’m melee lol. I’ll use them on like the 3 guns I have).
---
It had more.  They nerfed it.
---
No, the calculations OP did were just to split the total SCORE required into 70 daily chunks. So the rank requirement is still the same, if that is how you're planning to split it up. 
---
The mistake was just in a footnote explaining how much SCORE you earn from dailies and weeklies.
---
There's a text chat mod on PC, it's actually really quite decent. Most of the time. 
---
Beth needs to pull their finger out and release an official version though, along with a basic trade window with a confirm button.
---
Any of the schools in the game (Morgantown HS, Watoga HS) have plenty strewn about. Anywhere with a large cafeteria is a prime place to pick up them. Plus it resets your 'loose item respawn list' very quickly since there's so many utensils to pick up in your plastic hunt.
---
Well, there is no internet in the apocalypse, so people have some extra time to learn new stuff you know ;)
---
I dunno. Aim for heads maybe? We are oneshooting things anyway
---
 "- **less XP** ( you cut huge amount of XP, with unyielding set with +1int you get +30INT=+60% xp?)" - Unyielding set is 15 int, not 25.
---
They should just bring back the DT/DR system from the old games, it analogued reality really nicely without being game breaking
---
If that logic is sound, ultracite laser gun should share skins with regular laser gun.
---
Mark it with a magnifying glass in your crafting menu (I believe right thumbstick on xbox) and pick up every peice of scrap you see.
---
Buy it when you see it for sale.
---
I assume you're bundling to sell?
---
Try selling  your extra junk in vendor for cheap as scrap peices while you look for plastic!
---
Lol
---
Why not wait a month to exploit then if you're worried about anything actually happening to the cheaters? You can exploit now and risk whatever punishment being doled out in the future, or wait, but risk them actually doing something to stop exploits. So if you're worried about missing out finishing the board, just go ahead and do it.
---
Abbie's bunker in the Northeast section of the map begins the questline. I believe you're sent there if you finish rose's raiders questline (the one NOT for Wastelanders content).
---
Why would you wait a month? There is no such thing as a risk
---
It only goes up 25 score per level, if he’s already at 20 basically 21 he only needs 79 levels in 9+ weeks and there are double score and double xp weekends planned with supposed “fixes” to events which should also reward score at some point. You act like 25 extra score a level is a major issue but it really doesn’t add up as much as you think. If you know how to take advantage of x2 buffs with mutations and high intelligence builds you basically always have double xp, I’ve seen people who are already 33+ and it hasn’t even been a week. It won’t take as long as you think to reach 100 before the 10 weeks are up.
---
I just take a pic on my phone, and delete as I complete! :)
---
&gt; Atom Shop items being limited time only, I could always just wait until they come around again. But now, while they at least simplified some of the challenges (like the above level up ones), you basically HAVE to do them. That or consu
---
I 100% agree with this.
---
Okay yes, the rank calculations are independent from the SCORE calculations, but it's still quite misleading to make people think they need to finish the repeatable quest 10 times more than they actually do.
---
But what if you always run solo and never join a team?
---
Have you claimed the rewards? You have to select them and confirm it for each rank reward.
---
Lol, why are you asking reddit then if you've already decided what you should be doing? Just go ahead then sir!
---
bethesda only banned those people who bullied another player by calling him a homo
---
Well I donno what to tell you, Angry Turtle did it over 10 times using the same NPC and he proved it doesnt work with video proof.
---
ancient 'poon, ahoy!
---
I'd love to see this. I've been playing on Xbox for about a year now and seeing a possible influx of players sounds like a great thing for the game
---
Selling legendaries and using those caps to pay people to do it for you.
---
I'm not asking. I'm giving you guys a heads up
---
Learning the plan on one character unlocks it for them, but not for any other characters.
---
Bloodied
---
It's times like these that I'm glad I have Fallout 1st and a private world to retire to - especially after a whole lot of obnoxious people logged on to RDR2 when it hit GamePass. Funnily enough, that was the reason I came back to 76.
---
Ik what it is and I need help doing it, I don't have the perks and I don't think it works with the Gatling plasma legacy I have
---
The only person I play with who would help me is on vacation rn
---
TSE was nerfed into uselessness, bloodied and unyielding is the way to go.
---
Which one would the closest in terms of gameplay to Two Shot Explosive?
---
Why are we telling them to do their job?
---
Thank you so much
---
That's disappointing. Someone recommended Junkies as well. Which out of Bloodied or Junkies would be the closest to the Two Shot Explosive experience in terms of gameplay?
---
Couldn’t agree more with ya m. Happy hunting!
---
Either or. Depends on whether you like health or not
---
If the event teams are running unyielding then that makes even less sense. Event XP is capped at 4000 XP and and with INT and XP buffs I already get close to that. With lunchboxes I already go over the cap. So the event team bonus would be a waste. On double XP weekend even more.
---
No, because that only applies to weapons that were added to the game later. 
---
There is a base legendary pool that everyone draws from no matter what, with all the original weapons and armor included.
---
You then learn plans of weapons like the fixer or bear arm to get them added to that pool.
---
Assuming you used to run full health, then Junkies.
---
But many weapons were TSE, I assume you used to run TSE shotty, if so grab a Junkies Gauss shotgun.
---
That sounds excellent. Thank you!
---
It’s the problem with the games pvp is that is all people can do. It’s not a pvp fight if u just run away the whole time and then be surprised no one likes pvp
---
Legacy weapons are in demand. Any two shot explosive (TSE) that shouldn’t do that (like a shovel - hit me up if you have one - I’m on PC, same IGN) especially. Energy weapons with TSE are considered legacy since they removed that ability from energy weapons. 
---
If you have anything cool, even a pet rock, be prepared to be accused of hacking. Ignore them. Have fun. :)
---
Also if you have any CAMP blueprints make sure they can still be built before you delete them. I have one of the few copies left of the stairs with a mesh landing that has half panel wood flooring in the mesh.
---
Apparently you can play the game to earn the rewards too.
---
No worries, if you literally are just returning, it will take a fair amount of work to get the gauss shotty mind  :-)
---
Bethesda banned several people at the start of the game for exploiting to gain cosmetics.
---
Obviously, this will be a ban too.
---
It takes me at least 45 minutes to complete my daily Fallout 76 routine which consist of getting my 200 gold bullion, 1400 caps, 150 scrip, and now the legendary run.
---
Yes. You can. Obviously.
---
I was just pointing out that if you came into the fray late, or you don't have a crazy amount of time to grind challenges, the 'cost' of skipping to the end isn't that high.
---
as far as i know this was the fact with the armor after introduction. but it lead to bugging enemies and killing OTHER peoples gameclients! so they nerfed the effect accordingly.
---
Many players do server hoping for clearing out West-Tek or other locations to farm XP. They only join teams for getting Inspirational and Strange in Numbers bonus and move on to the next server after they cleared the location.
---
That's a hard one to answer really. Can you play without it?. Sure. Does it make life infinitely easier?. Yes most definitely. 
---
Free fast travel and scrap/cook facility wherever you want, not to mention infinite scrap, private servers, and the atoms alone are worth the cost. 
---
If you play often enough that the cost per hour played is small then I'd say go for it. Let's say you play 50 hours a month, for the sake of argument. 
---
$50 / $12.99 = $0.26 per hour, that's great value as far as I'm concerned. 
---
If you only play a few hours a month then I'd say it's not value. It still might be worth it, really depends on your financial situation.
---
You have no idea how many exploits are going on atm. When was the last time you heard about a ban wave?
---
I'm with you. In an ideal game cheaters would get banned so all players had equal opportunities, but that isn't this game. 
---
I don't want there to be hacks, cheats and exploits, but I benefit  from them indirectly, through finding huge numbers of rare plans outside a train station, buying my bloodied combat knife that has the exact same legendaries as other knives sold in other people's vendors.... Exploits influence everyone's game.
---
So I encourage you to cheat, and talk about it openly. Either it will help Bethesda realise they need to moderate their game, or it will let other players know they don't need to play fair.
---
Anyway, anyone want to tell me how to do this new exploit?
---
[There’s a SCORE calculator](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/score.html) that will tell you how far you’ll get by the time it ends. You should double check your progress. If you skip ANY NW SCORE, or miss a thing on a day or weekly, you won’t complete it.
---
Excuse me what 
---
How do generators generate money? 
---
If it's anything other than just a shitload of water purifiers, I am very intrigued
---
actually that 40% damage reduction is nothing in late game when enemies shot you with X dmg per hit with correct normal armor. Power armor have so many disadvantages this reduction is nothing to compare.
---
i was thinking the same, but when you compare to synergy of bloodied mechanics its already too much dmg dont need that extra dmg. One kill per hit usually is enough, and its easy to make it even without any dmg card in your special. 
---
BTW i use heavy weapon and dont use power armor and im fine, more than fine, its super effective because of things mentioned in first post. Its only mental block thinking its better.
---
Who the hell would want to change your mind? You are talking sense.
---
Whatever is able to be used on one should be usable on the other, end of.
---
yeah... but what’re you excited for? you can only use it on the crappy combat rifle XD
---
Someone made a pc version with more options for a second screen. Loved having a spare 24inch monitor with a moving map.
---
You're not wrong, those things are still broken despite the patch notes... but let's be real, do we expect anything less at this point? :(
---
Hey, I’m excited about that 10mm skin!
---
You just wait till Halloween. I’ll switch my build to guns so I can be spooky. 
---
I haven’t looked yet but can the skins be NW favorites? I obv use combat rifles and assault rifles way more in NW.
---
Add a vendor timer when the caps etc renew ;)
---
That’s a good idea;)
---
well, i play a lot in power armor and dont feel im less tankier without it. 
---
Game became somehow in some point not really depended on numbers. Power armor is easy way how to play quests lines on early levels, but after that you cannot die in proper non power armor armor so what is point wear PA with tons of disadvantages (except role-play).
---
January 2020 had a ban wave.
---
I agree it mixed up the lone wanderer meta, it kinda sucks a but tho because 15 % EXP is too good to pass up now with the season journey, so people just join teams for the bonus and don't play together
---
Had this happen to me last week, had to rebuild my entire camp to fix it.  Took about 3-4 hours 😫
---
I agree with you in that I don't think bloodied works well with Power Armor yea, for dps Junkies would be much better, allowing the damage reduction to be more affective as it has a bigger healthpool to effect
---
You'll be dying a lot less than a bloodied build would, so that's more uptime for dps
---
Thats why i said *"That said, normal armors are still better."*. I was just commenting on tankiness.
---
Did you try it yet? See for yourself
---
Really cool! I'm super new to this game and it astounds me what is possible! Are you scared of losing this to a Nuke?
---
Where does one get that?
---
Not sure I want to look at this given I haven't started yet!
---
I am also not at the whitespring. But people like the same good locations.
---
Wow, amazing! I probably have that stuff laying around hehe.
---
Are you the Youtuber??
---
What level are you? Just curious. 
---
To be fair at some point the 200 gold, 150 scrip and 1400 caps will become something you can do in literally 2 mins. 
---
Perhaps it's just me, but I have more treasury notes than I know what to do with, and with all the events I run more scrip than I can use in a week anyway and it just gets worse as time goes on.
---
The only thing that might take time is the 1400 daily caps, but that can be done by selling excess legendaries, serums, marine helmets, a uranium fever run, etc.
---
Why do you think anyone here cares that you are going to cheat? I assure you, nobody does.
---
I have to give you more power for doing this. Based on the experience of a friend and videos, now builds are unheard of. 
---
Personally crossbows **need** a better one or another tier, as it is outperformed by the bows (as you said), yet it’s the only one that can be used in power armor.
---
Like I said, if you’re on PC and want to trade old for new, or want a live check on what is worth more than the rest, hit me up. I can get on now or another day.
---
So I'm already behind as I don't do the NW dailies. Ah well. 
---
I was planning on buying the last 10 levels at least anyway.
---
Yeah I was thinking this, why actually play this like a job when I could go for a run instead and just do my regular job and pay the difference rather than a few beers or whatever. Insert Bethesda cackling sound.
---
I'll look into it. It's appreciated!
---
Missed 2 dailies yesterday and refuse to to the Nw ones as I'm not playing some BR rubbish, but I'm already 16 and half think I'm doing okay ish.
---
PC is a different animal from PlayStation and XBox. On PC people will sell a red asylum outfit for 1000 caps or just give it to you. On PlayStation it’ll cost you a legacy and 50k caps and that has nothing to do with duped items. They just seem to be easier to find on PC I guess. So know your audience.
---
Max rep with foundation
---
Well, there's a fireplace secret door as a reward in the legendary run, it's honestly the one thing I want the most out of that thing.
---
Issue is; it's unlocked at level 98 or something..
---
And this right here why gaming companies keep pushing "micro transactions". Because there are always **idiots** who think it is ok to buy them. Hurting all the gamers in general. And making the industry more and more greedy.
---
This and fixes for melee issues (hit reg, differentiating the melee types, and more) would be welcome.
---
Though I will say the low tier melees have a lot of unique options.
---
There's also the 4th floor of Fort Defiance, if you have access to it.
---
Alternatively, farm high level super mutants (Westek, Huntersville), equip the Scrapper perk and scrap all their laser rifles.
---
I'm already way ahead of that on 3 accounts and it's not even got accurate information on extra xp and score events so frankly it's worthless.
---
Maxed lifegiver is OP if you use speed demon.
---
For some reason the mutation heals you to whatever max health boost you are receiving,  so you will always heal to 45 health super fast and can't really die from anything that isn't hitting for that much damage minimum.
---
Which part of the quest are you on?
---
This is up there with the water well and flares as the most dissapointing bullion item, buy the regular armor instead.
---
Okay. I found it useful. GIGO probably. It took me a while to tweak it to the right numbers and it’s spot on for me. /meh
---
Yau gaui get lured into the raiders camp and are shot at tho.
---
Thats not even fully 15k. You can get 9×150 on the way and they said there is 500 atoms reward at the end.
---
So, thats just 13650 atom to teach level 100 (15000-1350) and there you get 500 back (if this isnformation is true).
---
All those exploits and no banwave since january. Bravo
---
I'd like to know this answer as well. It's in my achievements with 0 progress, but I have heard of someone getting it recently. 
---
Not the new Ghillie Suit skins for armour sets.
---
Do you know if I have gamepass on PC if my Xbox atom purchases and characters are available on there?
---
&gt;There’s a SCORE calculator that will tell you how far you’ll get by the time it ends. You should double check your progress. If you skip ANY NW SCORE, or miss more than a few things on a day or weekly, you won’t complete it.
---
That´s not true. That calculation is not taking in the repeatable XP SCORE award.
---
 [https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/score.html?](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/score.html?)
---
Are you taking full advantage of food and xp buffs? It makes a huge difference. I don't think that calculator takes into consideration people can legitimately be running around with over double xp at any time. I quite curious how lunchboxes will stack with the double xp weekend as that could give some insane results.
---
22 as of today, probably going to go for 24 after reset.
---
24, near 25
---
Is it a coincidence that the atoms awards are each exactly how much you need to buy a SCORE level? Suspect I'll end up using them to do just that.
---
Only got back in to the game midday Saturday after a couple of months off. Got to level 5 before the weekend was out, though I think the game has cheated me out of some SCORE points. Rebuilt my base yesterday, fulfilling all the requirements of the weekly challenge for building things, and the challenge shows as complete but I didn’t receive my points!
---
You do not have to buy the whole season. Earn the rewards for free and the problem is solved.

Wait they didn´t fix god mode?
---
The best two builds to use are bloodied and junkies it's not a debate
---
I'm aware. That is what i'm doing.
---
No, the calculator doesn’t min/max. It only considers what is shown but those buffs can be calculated and entered by you in the level progression percentage slot. 
---
Casual players, like myself, who abhor NW and don’t have 6 hours a day to play - every day - won’t make it. Even with buffs.
---
19.  That's with all dailies done so far and a few hours every night event grinding.
---
A hell lot of us. Some whale will buy they way, but thats the minority.
---
I've made the 2nd position once afk while taking a shower
---
Yeah, sorry I just went on one after seeing so many negative posts on the issue. Also I've not long woke up and lacking coffee.
---
I mean hell - there was a ban wave just a few weeks ago.
---
Considering you didn’t do settler quests,  it’ll take a few weeks maybe more to get the rep to buy it
---
I did.
---
I can assure you we've all been idiots before mate. 
---
Embrace that shit and smile, if you can't have a laugh at your own stupidity it's a poor do.
---
Try doing the math on how long it will take to make up for even just a missing 20k score.
---
34.  Completed day one challenges and then didn't play for a few days.  Only had 1 challenge not give me SCORE.  Been grinding since.
---
Even at level 150 they can still be a pain in the ass
---
Note: I’m not defending the calculator. Do your own math. You won’t make it unless you can spend more time in game than normal JUST to keep up.
---
Ban wave like a week and a half ago.  Just not announced.
---
13.
---
As long as you have the blocker perk any amount of armor over 250 is not really doing anything for you, it does not hurt, but armor in this game gets hit by diminishing returns hard. the difference in 100 and 200 armor is more than the difference between 200 and 1000, 
---
So it does not really matter what set in particular you use, as even max level sturdy armors do what you need them to, it's all about the legendary effects.
---
Google is your best friend for those (not secret) Secret’s.
---
Unyielding , i have 34 agi and no sneak cards. I can sneak by any enemy
---
With buffs 100 score is a run around West Tek.
---
Ban waves can't just happen. You have to research why the problem is occurring before you ban. It is the same for every online game.
---
34.  Finished challenges for day 1 and then took a few days off from playing.  Came back and started grinding.
---
To be honest at low levels ammo can be a real pain and you should carry a few different weapons with different ammo types for this issue, plus a decent melee backup. Once you get to a higher level ammo gets to be less of an issue. Unless you like Miniguns!
---
If you're on PC let me know what ammo you need, I can whip up a batch for you for free. In fact what weapons do you use, I'll make you some low level fully modded ones as well.
---
34 currently.  Finished day 1 and then took a few days off before coming back to start the grind.
---
Not an idiot. But hey, thanks!
---
It doesn't hurt the industry. If anything, it helps it as companies now have more resources to pump into games.
---
I went ahead and took a pic of each of my bloodied Gauss/Caster weapons. This is with all of the weapon perks, Demo Expert, Adrenal reaction, and Nerd Rage. https://imgur.com/a/KwedYdD
---
These numbers are a little lower than what I posted and after wracking my brain on why I have come to the conclusion that it's because I was on a team and was sharing Strange in Numbers with Adrenal Reaction. 
---
Also I confused Adrenal Reaction with Adrenaline when I told you I didn't factor in that damage lol.
---
This needs more upvotes.
---
75 points shy from 17.
---
And now you are delusional too..
---
Is your hp level changing? That will do it.
---
WHY would someone like to throw tatoos!? ... oh.... wait.... ahm...... \*duh\*
---
That’s the point. There’s ZERO risk. As long as you’re not injecting code into the game to win, duping or having more than an unreasonable number of a given thing (think six figures), or have (had) in your inventory hundreds of copies (that you couldn’t share anymore) of every Secret Service plan the week after Wastelanders came out - nothing will befall you. 
---
I have four completely duped character on my account. I have eight playable characters. Each with an exact copy of every cool thing I owned on each. 
---
Want to know how?
---
Bethesda. 
---
They compensated everyone who filed a ticket when the inventory hack was reported by giving them exact copies of their characters as of 12/20/19. Plus other crazy things like what was it? 1000 Vault Steel?
---
Yeah, they don’t care. Have fun. Grinding isn’t fun for me and I pay to play.
---
I had like  2000 shotgun shells for sale, but never ever has anyone bought some.
---
18, going on 19. 😊
---
You can't really grief anyone when your a new player
---
I found 3 creatures just by walking around the edges.
---
If I recall correctly, the gourds aren't in a planter, the fruits are there  instead of the plants.
---
And how many to make up for the lacking 20k if you don’t do NW every day?
---
Bug mvp
---
Perks that give more carry the lower your weight?
---
Drank alcohol that gives you strength?
---
Nope, also do you know if it works with Gatling plasma
---
Yeah I’ve clicked on them but it doesn’t work for some reason. The board thinks I’m level 1 but my XP says otherwise. Might need to try a reinstall maybe
---
Bought it despite seeing a bunch of posts about it being broken or something (??).  Worked fine for me, looks cool too.  I stash my fixer and switch to my handmade when I've stockpiled an abundance of 5.56.  I don't craft more of that type so once I run low I swap guns again.  Fixer looks extra boring now after swapping back.
---
You've missed some days and gotten at least 18 levels from just getting XP?!?
---
Take a day off,go out see the sun and trees and keep away from everyone.
---
How do you think continual development costs are covered? How do you feel server costs are covered?
---
Initial game development is also more expensive than ever before, while at the same time we haven't seen a rise in the price of games in almost 15-years now. Games are at the point where you simply cannot cover your costs if you create a game and don't do anything further to it. There aren't enough sales.
---
The problem is people also want massive advancements in graphics and features, causing development costs to shoot up. These same people then complain that development needs to be funded somehow.
---
You don't tell me what to do with my money, and I won't tell you what to do with your money.
---
No it isn't. It's half as much as Cranberry Relish. They do not stack.
---
If you do every challenge daily and weekly, you'll miss it too.
---
But if you are playing you'll get more score from XP to center most of it.  Some people are already tens of levels ahead of where they should be.
---
Also don't forget the double score weekend and double XP weekend.
---
&gt;might as well try
---
Pretty sure that's their point
---
No point.  Personal reasons.  The mindless grind keeps my mind off things.
---
I'll reach 21 after today's reset. Was aiming for 20 this week so I'm happy with the progress so far.
---
I hit 20 tonight. I’ve been logging in and doing all of the dailies and making sure I hit the repeatable XP bonus once. I usually hit it 2-5 times though depending on what I’m doing and how long I play.
---
Can't you just start a new character and level up leaving the vault every day? 
---
That takes no time at all.
---
Kill super mutant for laser rifle, salvage it with scrapper perk about 20 plastic. So far I got 20k of plastic.
---
Most times my health only gets lower but I tend to stay at a comfortable 35 health out of 340 my rads stay the same though.
---
It was great to see all the players on XBox the last few days during the holiday but maybe this is why I kept getting bumped from the server?  It seems the new SCORE system has brought a lot of players back, hopefully the Game Pass doesn't make it worse.
---
Shotgun + max enforcer perk (+limb damage legendary if possible) x shoot it's legs = wrecked assaultron.
---
They won't be.
---
use ur fists
---
"the only winning move is not to play."
---
Not sure why you're being downvoted.
---
Fastnut was the part that was the changer for me.  With text chat purple talked, they planned, friends were added and you got to know people and saw literally everyone on the server at the same place.  (Yes, two or three were just sitting at a bench or hiding in a corner thinking you couldn't see them).
---
Now I'm in a team, but so far it's just been there in name only.  I've not had a team experience, just 3 new fast travel points that get me a bit extra score.
---
Oh, you can.
---
Just not in the same way.
---
My friend made a character. She is running around and she had maybe 3 new players constantly tailing her all the way to Flatwoods and kept saying "hey baby" "hey baby" and sending hearts.
---
17, played a few hours each night. Completed all dailies except day challenges and a few NW ones.
---
You need to do an extra 30k xp in adventure a day. It's not that hard to do. Also, most the NW challenges require very little participation so if you still insist on not even trying them that's on you.
---
Not everyone has 30 minutes every day to play.
---
Me too! Have also won as Aquaboy.
---
Take into consideration that every level that you increase requires 25xp more than the previous. Lvl1-1000 s.c.o.r.e.; 2-1025; 3-1050; 4-1075, etc.
---
Add them and you need 372,250 points total. (If you get 75,000 from weeklies and 140,000 from dailies in those 10 weeks you can get 215,000 from just challenges) you get a deficit of 157,250 points; which you can get from completing the repeatable 1,572.5 times. Divided by the 70 days we have to complete it =22.46 repeatables/day; this means that you need to earn 224,600 of regular xp everyday in order to finish it. 
---
Id rather just pay bethesda  tbh
---
The whole idea of the ammo converter is great in theory, but seriously it is sooooooooo slow &amp; monotonous 🙄😬 It needs overhauling &amp; streamlining, big time 🤞
---
Blue dress sells for 3-4k
---
Yup. I like that that link allows you to figure in all those numbers, including the double XP’s. 
---
Keep in mind that the awarded score is bugged. People are getting score awarded for completing challenges at 3/5, 8/10. If they fix that it recalculate everyone’s earnings, those advancements and the ability to make them will be gone.
---
you want convenience? in a modern day game? not on todd's watch.
---
but seriously it's a good idea, does no harm, but i dont see it high on their priority list saddly
---
Yeah so I got drunk last night and ranted. Sorry peeps.
---
I think synths, but the whole idea is you wouldn't know, nightkin are pretty cool I hope they get added at some point.
---
Bloodied with unyielding armor is the meta. And wayyy  OP, so enjoy 🙂
---
:D
---
I didn't tell you what to do with your money.
---
Pandas.
---
The Sith (or Jedi, depending on which way you swing)
---
You. Because we are all our own worst enemies.
---
You essentially are by calling me an idiot for funding games I enjoy playing.
---
that's part of why i'm so mega salty about the game right now.
---
there is 
---
NO excuse for the season items to not be in the atom shop.
---
NO excuse for the stability of patch 20, even if it is just "for some people"
---
NO excuse for the main feature of patch 20, the score, not being given to players consistently
---
NO excuse for the lack of compelling true multiplayer.
---
like the score part is my biggest peeve right now. 2500 short i am.  there's a fucking pts and yet somehow i'm getting score early on challenges, and not getting it at all from other challenges.  i think half, or less than half have functioned as intended for me.
---
which means either i miss out on ranks, grind my ass off, or pay.  yay me as a paying customer, formerly a first subscriber even.  first members really ought to have some kind of score bonus or something.
---
This. Many people don't know that the Assaultron's weakpoint is its legs not its head
---
Just hit 21. Fiancé is about the same. We’ve been diligent about all the dailies + XP farming but probably not super extreme. Having fun so far!
---
I made it to second with nothing but wood armor and a scoped rifle. Almost won but the other guy had a gatling and marine armor.
---
So it's impossible for me...
---
Tried to start a NW match. He won't let me join cuz i changed my data (yes i really changed it for fps and mouse sensitivity and I won't change it back)
---
Just wondering.... 1 year ago I was able to join NW matches without a problem o.O
---
https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic
---
No. NW is borked. The last time I played I got killed immediately upon start even tho no one was near me and I followed his view as he flew above the map at least 1000m, killing everything in one shot head shots. 
---
That’s not on me. 
---
Forcing players to engage in PvP to win is torture. They could have made THAT the way to earn extra, like the 100/10k. Also keep in mind that the main way non subscribers make (made) their Atoms was in dailies. Now that primary source of virtual money has been removed and replaced with a system that cuts those benefits a lot THEN wants them to PAY 150 more for each rank missed?
---
Nah. If you don’t have $9/mo you’re not going to have $100 to drop on Atoms just to get a cool fireplace.
---
The rrp of top end game prices did increase. Was £49.99 it is now £54.99. But the increase never properly took hold for various reasons, including because overall sales decreased at the rrp price and the rise of the 'free to play' model.
---
are you on PC? i could give you some SB hides
---
They are super broken... but rn even dominator assaultrons no longer bother me. 
---
A few things you should know:
---
You need to get close enough so you can actually hear her charge up/use the head laser. Otherwise it´s bugged an she can use it all the time and as long as she wants to.  No cooldown/charging unless you can hear it/see her head glow.
---
Always have something to put between you and the assaultron to hide from the beam.
---
Go for the legs and cripple them, they become very tame crawling on the ground. 
---
They tend to hate stairs, use it to your advantage ( no guarantees but so far having an ass on top of stairs and going up to fight, down to hide, almost never had her follow me )
---
Good luck!
---
21
---
I've been on the same grind. I can always find hands and meat but never the damn hide! I've heard the green footlocker also has a chance to spawn one. Good luck!
---
That is behind the rate of inflation, though.
---
It was my go-to in FO4. Shoot the legs pretty much for most robots (with legs). And to be fair mobs too. Once they can't run you have time to play with them
---
I've heard that if you contact bethesda and they refund you 150 atoms for each missed day.
---
No i'm calling you an idiot for supporting the general idea of mass monetization schemes that are only driven by greed.
---
That requires talent though 😎
---
If that's true that would help me get back to where I need to be or I could save it for the later score levels which take longer to level up on.
---
19 is the star wallpaper. So you're same as me 18
---
I also don't remember if that specific increase was more than 15 years ago. I'm sure it was around the time of the next gen release, so around 2006/7 maybe.
---
Yep it looks pretty sweet. There was also a nuka cola machine secret door that came with a bundle. I’m trying to brainstorm mob/mercenary ideas though and get this post noticed enough for Bethesda to be interested. Maybe they’ll make another mob bundle.
---

The Commonwealth Minutemen (they are enemies to me)
---
I tend to disagree with you. I bought the game at release, paying ~£45 for it. I've been playing it 3-5 times a week ever since. Without people paying for atoms/fo1st there would be no way at all Bethesda would have released Wastelanders as a free DLC, I would have had to pay for it. 
---
So if OP wants to pay £/$100 to unlock all the rewards then that (according to Bethesda) will secure more free DLC for me.
---
If no-one buys in, or pays for atoms or FO1st, bye bye free DLC.
---
You have the perk card that gives you strength from 6 am to 6 pm? I use that and at night time I lose about that much also being as it only gives you strength for those 12 hours
---
You mean you don’t get 10% of what the try hards get
---
So Im like level 18 right now. What can I do to catch up before it snowballs into a bigger problem?
---
You can't kill a player's horse like you can in RDR2 but you can still be a griefer, especially to other new players and also when there are environmental factors at play, like cars you can explode to injure other players.
---
20
---
Regarding PC  Bethesda said Steam &amp; Bethesda Players are on the same servers. Logically W10 would be the with us too.
---
Well I hope so, more players is great
---
Yes. Something to make it worth it.
---
I've no intention of using T65 at this point. I got a jetpack on my Strangler Heart arm while that was a thing, so its a lot better for me.
---
Even discounting unintended effects, I'd pretty confidently say the the SH set bonus, despite how gutted it was, is still more valuable than the friggin 100 extra DR that T65 has over it.
---
They? Too bad that Obsidian not working on F76
---
Where do you get this? And do you fancy selling it?
---
One thing I didn’t appreciate about bloodied until I tried a full unyielding set this week is the QoL it adds. Except for having no health, everything else is better. Crit meter and AP bar fill faster, you can sprint longer, you always have CHA for speech challenges, plenty of carry capacity, etc. 
---
Old news to many but useful for noobies to the build.
---
Last time I played I couldnt put wall paper on wooden walls with windows or cottage walls with windows.
---
7. Vintage Nukashine
---
And since the shareholders helped to fund the games I enjoy, they should get a reward back.
---
If people weren't making profit, they wouldn't be willing to invest to produce the games I like.
---
I've given evidence showing my auto-completed challenges over the last 3 days (didn't correct itself later etc). Bethesda just shrugged their shoulders..
---
maybe you completed a daily challenge whilest doing the event,
---
from all i know, at this point you dont get score from events but the devs mentioned that this is possibly coming in later updates
---
your mom
---
now you know somebody had to say it
---
Seeing this I am pretty much just going to give up on this stuff. There is just not way I can realistically get even close to finishing this stuff. Just trying to do all these challenges is hours every day. It just makes the game less appealing to play overall. I and some friends have been fallout 1st subscribers for quite a while now and enjoy playing on private worlds but this stuff is really grindy.
---
Why did you people downvote this?
---
It used to be the best pa, because the damage stacked like bleed used to in 4, leading to any high fire rate weapon shredding anything. They nerfed it to be in line with other dot effects aka its awful now.
---
Where are you camping at? Some people only make buy runs in the forest and heap for whatever reason.
---
Those people do not deserve the fill rewards then.
---
If you are not willing to put the effort in, you shouldn't be entitled to the same stuff that people who do put effort in can enjoy.
---
I noticed the change in text as well and my brother and I tried being across the map from each other and didn’t see a stat difference.
---
Next to top of the world train station. Usually get lots of visitors, and the vendors sell well. Just not this serum.
---
Seems independent of proximity for public teams, and seems to work even as the sole member of a public team.
---
Oh I never even thought of that makes sense too haha! Thank you! I'm trying to rank without really grinding cause don't really have time for it.
---
It’s always been near teammates. Maybe the text changed to make that point clearer.
---
same for me i accepted the fact that i wont finish the legendary run but i guess im gonna get pretty far without really grinding it anyways :)
---
That's right. It's always nicer just to play and enjoy the game receiving rewards on the way rather than grinding only for the rewards.
---
Is it just me, or have they changed the zoomed aim sensitivity? 
---
I'm currently using a 50cal and I swear that before when I zoomed in to aim, the sensitivity would reduce so I could get tighter, more controlled shots. Now the sensitivity stays the same as when I'm not zoomed in, making it harder to aim and meaning I'm wasting bullets.
---
'You must be' I dont like the way that is worded tbh. You're gonna stress some people out. 
---
People need to remember that they do NOT have to get to 100. Just do what you want. Nearly everything you get is cosmetic. You don't need to get it. Fallout life will move on without a secret fireplace door or fancy looking PA skin or some scrap kits Theres gonna be people busting their balls to get to the end and like me probably will never use a secret fireplace door or most if the skins. I'll just play the game and get what I get.
---
And to borrow a phrase from an advert. When the fun stops stop.
---
Bloodied is top dog, but a glass cannon. Bloodied sneak commando is fun to play.  
---
Junkies is next.
---
I'm tempted to start completely fresh on pc.
---
Sounds like a good plan. Coincidentally that's what i also plan to do with my current atoms. The required SCORE seems to increase by 25 for each level so the end is gonna be a grind.
---
I will do the same IF there are Xbox Live achievements for the Windows Store version of the game.
---
It takes me a few hours to level up and find a legendary enemy, these challenges are all good for the people level 9000 but the people who are starting a new this season they take time to do.
---
this is ridicolous. ill pass on this 'season'
---
The robot in the secret place. 3 star boss and it takes 2 minutes to do, jump server and repeat.
---
I'm lvl19 so that means i'm right on track for now but if they keep increasing the xp points then it's gonna take more time
---
Did you recently do Rose’s quest? She gives a full set of raider armor after it.
---
Oh well idk. My bro had this issue when he was selling prime reciever plans, ammo, plasma cores, and fusion cores. He'd sell them once in a blue moon. After he moved his house to the NE of Fissure Site Prime he couldn't stay stocked up.
---
Very strange. I'd try again and hope for a more competent support employee.
---
i wish i could see my regular game challenges inside NW like i can see my NW challenges inside the reg game
---
You act like Bethesda has no money and need your "investing" the whole atom store and fallout 1st was meant for the exact reason your describing... Bethesda will continue to add more ways to squeeze money out because people like you think it's perfectly okay to spend 100 quid on cosmetics that don't even look that great.
---
Yes I did. That must be it. Thank you
---
Probably looking for a rare event drop
---
What the hell are you playing on that takes 5 minutes to load!?
---
I got a .50 Cal Bloodied during Fasnacht.. Just tried it on the Queen.. So I can\`t compare really and when shE´s on the ground.. Kinda hard to miss ;)
---
The bos, gatorclaws, big ants, nuka enemies, bumper swords, cazadors, and a tiny deathclaw
---
I think it is OK to spend £100 on cosmetics I like, though. Cosmetics are a personal preference.
---
I am more than happy to give Bethesda my money. I give Zenimax a ton of cash through Elder Scrolls Online, and I am more than happy to continue to pay into Fallout 76 while I enjoy it.
---
They can at least contribute...
---
I mean, look all you want, but don't just sit there.
---
Ok for me it\`s on the PS4.. so almost nobody talks.. ths public teams are as good as you can wish for on console.. Had only 2 sessions with mic since game launch.. When I say.. I played alone.. Yeah.. alone alone ;)
---
PS4 here i can't even complete fertile soil before I crash or disconnect, it's becoming unplayable.
---
24, about 1000 points from 25, hoping to finish tomorrow on 26, then will see what the reset/maintenace brings.
---
Hey just wanna say thank you again! The game redownloaded this morning so I turned off my firewall and I can play!! Very happy
---
Centaurs. Need to bring those back, they freak me the fuck out.
---
Start scrapping handmades.
---
So all the armor you can get can be bought from Regs in Vault 79 so rep doesnt really matter I might be wrong on some of this but I believe all the unique armors are - Solar Armor health regen while above 60% health, Thorn Armor - poison damage to Melee attackers and increased stealth, Strangler Heart PA - Poison AoE, Secret Service - No set buff but gives highest Resistances + dope ass jetpack. Oh and for thorn, solar, and strangler heart armors you need ALL pieces for the set bonus
---
I have been with no luck lol
---
They've definitely changed the zoomed aim sensitivity.
---
Was this deliberate or a bug? It's less fun to play now that I'm having to readjust to shooting.
---
Be gattling plasma, b2525 fixer, b ss str powerfist. With builds for each of course
---
As horrifying  as they were I miss the centaurs :(
---
I wish it would just break down the ammo to the scrap to manually remake it into ammo again, the lead and powder are somwhat viable for that realisticly
---
The point would be that if something new comes out after your month ends, you would need to get another month. The idea is not to give everyone who once had FO1st at some point access to everything, but to retroactively give access to everyone who got a new subscription. 
---
For example, I had a month of FO1st. But during that month, they added jack shit.
---
Now the guys who decided to get it a month after me got that god awful paint (which is still better than nothing I guess).
---
So now I’m the idiot for getting it too early. See what I’m getting at here?
---
Every FO1st member who gets it or renews it should get access to all the FO1st items that are available up to that point.
---
Then continue giving them money through the atom store or fallout 1st, the value isn't on par with the quality.
---
Majority of the items in the season is the same thing but different armour. You can see they have tried splitting as much rewards as possible to attract you to spend money to complete the rewards.
---
E.g The ghillie skins could have easily been a one reward for all armour type but instead they split them up and dragged them across the board to make players think it's worth the grind when it's not likely to be so.
---
Same. But different problems.Servers for me on a ps4 pro have been garbage since just after fasnaucht ended. Buildings dont render sometimes. I get shot by invisibles other times. And the area load times have steadily gotten worse. I dont even participate in events anymore due to the lag.
---
Wasn't always like that, but in the last month or so it feels like its gotten steadily worse with each update or patch. I'm thinking of doing a fresh reinstall to see if it makes any difference.
---
They probably wanted you to get xp. They don’t need it.
---
Does this include double S.C.O.R.E?
---
Something seems to be bugged somewhere as my carry weight has been fluctuating the last several days too and it's not being caused by food/drink, status effects or perks.
---
Maybe because I take a positive resumee for Update 20 without mentioning the downpoints (of which I am aware and concerned). But nevertheless the Teams open up a new way of experiencing the game for me. And I enjoy it way more, than grinding the reputation for wastelanders.
---
And yeah Beth fixes 2 things and breaks 3 on the way.. That is old news to me.. since day 1 :)
---
You too :).. Thanks
---
The faq say you can regularly get score from public events. We will have to see if the repeatable weekly switches to that tomorrow.
---
That is what I meant by 'do something'.
---
Running around the area is doing something, even if you don't get a kill. Just stay in the event area and move about. At that requirement, people won't AFK.
---
scrap laser weapons with the scrapper perk card, each laser scrapped is 10 plastic and doesn't rely on fixed spawns that are likely already looted (unless on a private session)
---
Ts an explosive both use to give a 100% damage boost. That was nerfed to 25% and 20% respectively. That as well as the accuracy penalty and the fact that it cause your weapons to degrade 4x as fast it is not longer very sought after.
---
Bloodied is top dog for damage, give an 80% boost at 19% hp as well as a 50% boost from adrenal reaction and a 20% boost from nerd rage
---
Junkies gives 50% more with 5 addictions and can be done at full health
---
Now THAT's what they want to read from you!
---
Agreed a ban is a bit harsh, especially if someone was just passing through the area when the event ends they would just get banned for not helping
---
if you run mutations then your stats will be different solo vs group, I always forget about that one
---
still the idea that my wife and I are better when we are together is very romantic
---
They don't, they auto lock the ticket and insist there is nothing they will do to help!
---
With mini games, so we can get junk. Also stash management  ...something like that
---
Banning someone for 2 months because their toddler is crying in he next room and they need to put the controller down is a bit harsh. 
---
Just play the game and enjoy yourself. Don’t worry about other people.
---
I have never seen a mod kit for the suppressor. I'm afraid you're going to have to build and scrap, or find someone to mod it for you.
---
If the repeatable challenge for score is gonna stay get 10k xp then this should really boost the score gain even if it's just by a little bit.... And if the double XP counts towards it
---
Headless everything's that stand stationary and can't be killed.. Random scorched glitching into my camp walls -they can shoot me but I can't shoot them.
---
3 second delays in weapon quick swaps. Stimpak on the d-pad sometimes flat out not responding at all. And all that was just the first hour of gameplay Sun. morning.
---
I don't believe it is harsh.
---
But this is coming from somebody who is tired of people going AFK in ESO which actually costs me money.
---
What does b2525 mean, I'm assuming bloodied firerate but no idea what's next
---
Why not link directly to Bethesda’s announcement? I do not understand these “articles”.
---
Worker like a charm thanks!
---
make a build team, then as leader change it to events before an event finishes, then change back once its over. it doesn't reset the team bonds so you get the best of both worlds
---
Oh and sleep the kindred spirit effect is a good boost if you can't get a cranberry cobbler or if it stacks it's more xp (idk If xp effects stack ok)
---
High levels do something...High Levels stop one shotting all enemies at event... 
---
It's getting to the point where high levels will just have to sit in their camps twiddling thumbs 
---
Same type of post, different day.
---
Securitrons
---
Hey, Someone who doesn’t play NW here, The Hell’s a fixer?
---
You're confusing best with most powerful.  It's not the same thing.
---
Save your lunch boxes too! So much Scoooooore!!!!
---
25 less vats cost
---
From what I've noticed, most of the player base seem to enjoy seeing who can look the most ridiculous. Bethesda doesn't help much selling things like wiffle bat skins either, ha. Yeah every millisecond counts in PvP for sure
---
17
---
Oh alright thanks for the help I do appreciate it
---
It get the thumbs down emoji when I try and contribute to the event the lower levels don't like me taking the easy xp so I shoot until someone gets pissed then I stop and do the mothman dance instead lol
---
You just have to keep trying, or have someone add the supressor for you, no other way to do it unfortunately.
---
The same as a woman I guess.
---
What platform I'm on Xbox and I ussually see alot of event, building and casual teams hell came across a roleplay team all acting like James bond had tuxedos and silenced weapons taking out scorchbeasts and super mutants and returning to the leaders C.A.M.P Wich was built like a fancy bar. Seriously funny as hell
---
It Will certainly be nice to have more people on Xbox lobby’s now, No more servers with like 3 other people in them
---
I thought it was just me. I got a full set of Ultracite. Do you know if anyone rewards that?
---
Honestly you could try to go to the media. They seem to drool over any news regarding Fallout 76.
---
I am the rank I should be at for the effort ive put in.
---
I read somewhere that int helps increase chances of learning mods while scrapping. I’m not sure if it’s legit info though.
---
Alright, thanks for that, I see that everywhere but noone ever explained what it was
---
I feel bad going to that event. On one hand I need treasury notes but the experience I get at that event is very low. But I end up taking fun away from others because I can clear the event solo.
---
Paladin taggerdy quest with bos
---
i got rank 17
---
Ah Yes a Fellow Mothman Doing Gods Work
---
Bloodied FF25 FR15 Fatman MIRV
---
Of course carrying the ammo would break your back, and pretty suicidal in enclosed spaces. But fun...!
---
that’s awkward. it’s a weapon found only in adventure mode...
---
You heard me
---
Yikes
---
You’re out of touch with reality buddy
---
Does the perk card for increased experience work work when not in a full group also?
---
Ontop of his, carry a decent Melee like a fully modded bat at the right level too, I found killing stuff like animals and scorched with melee would really help.
---
I'm already at my CAMP converting my ammo so I got this covered ;)
---
The person who answered it's right, its from the BoS questline
---
&gt; I have done the event tons over multiple characters, and I thought all pipes had to survive.
---
Like most events, how successfully/thoroughly you complete it determines your reward. So for the best possible reward, you really should strive to complete all the optional objectives.
---
Someone else mentioned a rare drop, and yeah there is. You can only get the forest camo jumpsuit from this event (and a couple of others). And while I can't confirm this 100%, you probably have to complete the event flawlessly to even have a chance of that outfit dropping at all.
---
Worth it
---
No, it was confusingly worded for some. What they meant said is that you can earn score from completing the likes of events, but they meant to say “by doing challenges, some of which include completing events” they confirmed that they did not mean events themselves award or will award score—though they may change it down the line.
---
Camp out at Charleston landfill. He comes there more frequently than anytime I have seen him in the wild. He has a chance to show up at any claimed workshop. He’ll walk up the road that has the parking lot at the end and then chills about 30 feet from the entrance. Build a chair and wait for him to walk up the road.
---
Keep scrapping, I unlocked all but 2 mods for the handmade until the suppressor dropped.   
---
I can mod that for you if you'd like
---
I reported him last night! I made a post on here asking how to report luckily someone got a screen recording
---
I was referring to all of them including the Halloween, which gave me an additional 10mm pistol skin. Plus I got the shark 10mm skin and Halloween skins for combat rifle, assault rifle and minigun...not to mention the awesome Ghillie outfit!
---
I had someone on my public team open one at radiation rumble yesterday. I returned the favor and then he opened another one. The 75% experience bonus was amazing.
---
Than what's better lad? The most powerful build will always be the best build any competent person realizes that the only other ok builds are aa, furious, instigating, quad but they dont compete with bloodied and junkies
---
I haven't ever seen that? Even at 2/3am, I always manage to get an almost full server.
---
I'm "definitely" not guilty of doing that and owning the wiffle bat xD 
---
Though I grinded the atoms instead of buying them.
---
I am almost level 100 and if I do an event like tea time, and other low level events I always bring a weapon that doesnt 1 tap the enemies that spawn because it help lower players and gives me a better challenge.
---
I HATE NW. I tried it for just a bit and decided to never go back. I find arena and pvp stuff to be deeply boring.
---
It eats my 2mm EC well enough. It’s 50/50 on using the machine or just dumping excess ammo at a station.
---
About half way through 27. I’ve not done any of the NW challenges, but did all the rest—plus countless of the weekly repeatable one.
---
I definitely lost 15lbs in the last week.
---
How does someone going afk cost you money?
---
28. I think I'll slow down next week though if they change the weekly repeatable from xp to events.
---
This a lie
---
Absolutely!
---
Honestly dude. Ive been rocking up in T-60 with an automatic laser rifle and an handmade rifle and ive been doing just fine. Just get the perks to make a megaTon of ammo
---
XP scrolls cost money.
---
When they go AFK in a dungeon, my XP scroll doesn't stop working. It is costing me money just to be standing around.
---
6....7 maybe. Couldn't be happier as I don't give two shits about space or ghillie suits.
---
A season of realistic combat weapon skins and armor would have me upset at my standing. Whereas I have a sexy sink and a curious ammo machine.
---
I normally get really empty servers, Only time I get truly full servers is when there’s 10 Level 200s Fighting a Scorchbeast Queen or something
---
The sentry bots and assultron both do but yes the butlers and gardeners do not
---
*BoS would like to know your location*
---
This is great information, at level 322 I learn something every day from reading Reddit posts.  I had a great time this past weekend, by joining a Team and playing the game for four hours Friday, Saturday and Sunday I was able to level up 10 times just from jumping one event to the other.  I like being on a team, it allowed me to get to level 16 on the Seasons map without paying attention Daily and Weeklies, this and two hours every week day and it should get me to level 100 by the end of the Season.  I started the weekend with 39 gold script and when I quit playing Sunday afternoon I had 170.  I don't think I could have done any of this without the new Seasons and Team play.  At this point the only piece of gear I don't have from the Wastelanders update is the Chinese Stealth Armor and who needs that when I have a full set of everything else?   I guess my point is just play the game, use the benefits of Tasty Squirrel Stew and your SPECIAL cards to buff up and have a good time.
---
But they can still headlaser you from the ground.
---
Afraid you’re soon to be banned for witch-hunting - I’d suggest you take this down quick.
---
This^^
---
I thought they renewed at the beginning of the month regardless.
---
Yeah me and my friends holding ours for the double exp weekend where it's going to be the most boring but hardcore exp grind haha gimme scooore
---
Well not right now but I would appreciate it tomorrow lol what time is it for you? Also the amount of help you are handing out is completely thanked.
---
Why on earth would you spend money on a xp scroll? You get plenty from daily log-in rewards.
---
The Fixer is a named combat Rifle in the game, it includes a sneak bonus on it.  Plan can drop for the event encrypted.
---
With the exception of soloing the queen, which was never designed to be soloed anyway, there's absolutely nothing a junkies or bloody build can do that a properly built let's say instigating build can't do.    In fact a proper instigating build can one shot 85% of enemies out there which is just as fast as the two builds you mentioned.
---
Again, don't confuse most powerful with best.  Best is relative.  You think something is best because you like it, but to say to someone that doesn't know that bloodied or junkies are the only way to go is just dumb.
---
Machetes got me through the early game.
---
Nah at this point I'll just sign up for the class action lawsuit. This game was a money laundering scam unless they start proving otherwise.
---
 No
---
Likewise. You can bump into some of them and not even go into caution 😄
---
Next topic : People participating and one shotting things need a 80 day ban
---
Each point you have in Intelligence you gain more XP. I've seen many different numbers reported but it's around 3% per point.
---
Shame, pretty confusing why it shows me then.
---
It’s mainly junkie commando builds using Tesla’s and explosive lasers rn
---
Oh, it does calculate with the double score weekend and the double xp weekend too (for the repeatable). Also, it is aware that the next repeatable will be an event one, not a xp farming one?
---
NukaChugger, the point was the ability to take a lot of damage while fighting high levels out of sneak. I can kill it easily as well with ranged weapons and my build is more universal.
---
Oh dear lord hand pick the shit from this season out of the atom store for HALF THE PRICE when the next one kicks off.
---
It's 11:48am for me, i'm able to play from around 5pm for the next few days.
---
I really wanted to use my nice new expensive TSE handmade, but really needed the suppressor. Took me a tonne of resources to make enough to scrap.
---
I play a lot. If you are doing a 10-12 hour session, you aren't getting enough XP scrolls from the login rewards.
---
When there wasn't login rewards, I used to regularly buy them as well.
---
Holy shit, learn to read between the lines, lol.
---
I like the allstar bat with the rocket, heated puncturing mod. Looks cool lol
---
Weird. What region are you in? I just hopped between 3 servers in Europe, and all had at least 10 players on them doing various things.
---
I believe so, there will be dobbel score events coming as well so hopefully that will boost us all up
---
I've lost a good amount of score as well with weeklys just not giving me the rewards.
---
They've also borked zoomed aiming. Both regular and zoomed aiming now have the same sensitivity, so it's a pain having to readjust to higher aiming sensitivity when it was completely fine before.
---
These, along with the gimped ammo machine, are really putting me off playing.
---
are you on a wall?
---
Fair enough
---
I have no problems with any creatures.
---
You can grind xp for the repeatable quest (which gives 100xp) or buy levels
---
i have no problem shooting them down with a shotgun.
---
Farm watoga highschool on a private if you're able to, nothing worse then monster mash going off and someone coming along and taking your scrap.
---
I thought it was coming out on the 9th. Am I wrong in thinking this?
---
There was another that gave elder maxsons coat
---
Yeah, I'm clearing all the dailies, provided I don't run out of time.
---
i shoot them down whenever i see vertibots, i have about 20 nuc cards stocked up for when i want to do a nuke run. They are a bit of a pain, but i usually can have one down in a minute or two using VATS
---
ill take a ban on reddit if it helps anyone
---
That lip liner is a war crime
---
Oh my.
---
I thought it was the 7th. My bad.
---
Thanks for this, I have to spend 750 atoms to achieve this target for week one.
---
Nice. Thank you.
---
Why didn't you just fail the event then? It's what i would have done.
---
I keep seeing these things when I haven't even summoned them. Usually around the Top of the World and the Sons of Dane compound.
---
I always kill them too, and loot the cards. So I always have more cards than I need (but thankfully they sell for a decent price).
---
Am I killing *other players* cargobots? Or are they just random spawns? I could never figure it out.
---
I still need the XP and drops.
---
Yup. I tested that myself.
---
Even with top level good with salt perk, cranberries go bad pretty fast, though. It’s usually best to have all your other ingredients ready before grabbing some!
---
Starting kit I like to give out:   
---
Modded baseball bat, allstar, rocket heated puncturing mods.
---
BoS rifle  
---
Officer underarmour with one of the mods that adds DR.  
---
Leather armour, with the highest DR mod and either Deep pocketed or ultra light.  
---
Ammo, purified water, stims radx and radaway
---
Dang dude if I saw that I'd buy them all!
---
[ sadly yeah. ](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/xbox-game-pass-games-list-this-month-price-6400)
---
&gt;Fallout 76 (added July 9th, 2020)
---
yall got my hopes up.
---
Well I guess I'm behind! I'm on level 19 but we ha e until mid September. Honestly, there is  ton 150 atoms given out, and I have so many saved up that I may pay my through the end. I hate grinds so much, there's already to much with the bullion and script in place and now this. I got better things to do with my time.
---
And with class freak 3 i get no negative effects from being solo (not in a party)
---
but why would i not be in a party anymore? Exactly. It's a win win situation.
---
This. I get so sick of hearing people bitching about me one shotting everything and then complain that I don't participate. Either you want the XP or you don't, I can roll in and finish the event for you without even breaking a sweat. The problem is, not everybody thinks like you.
---
This is hilarious but also I hate you. Where did you hide??
---
My name is RI133CK and I am a Pepperoni aholic.
---
Well you are a fucking god then
---
He could also be referring to taking a vacation. Not everyone can haul their Xbox with them on vacation. So if you want to leave your house for a week or so, better not expect those rewards.
---
I like this idea. However, i believe after a few seasons the menu will be a cluster. Like imagine beeing 10 seasons further and having 10 different progression screens. 1000+ times to look trough and decide what u want.
---
Overall. Not a bad idea. But id stick to the current system. Makes the reward a lil but sweeter knowing you worked your ass off for it
---
Nice idea, shame it won't happen. It would be very satisfying to know that all my progress this season won't be wasted if the next one allows me to finish it off
---
Other players 100%, but I’m pretty sure they made it so everyone can get a card from that specific drop :)
---
As a user of both the crossbow is also much more accurate in vats and has less “drop off” when long range firing.
---
At level 358 all my weapons 1-tap everything.
---
Yeah man I won my first NW match solo the other day and I was stunned! I wish I could say it was a completely kill-free run but I did take out the 4th position player, who was in the bush in front of me. 
---
After that, Idk how they let this happen but the remaining two players died in the fire? Again, I was shocked by this but not complaining, then I unlocked the sweet skeleton suit :)
---
When I can even get them within VATS range they go down in one clip. It’s getting within that range that’s a chore.
---
Hi RI133CK. This is a safe place. Is there anything you like to share? ;)
---
yes. Just not as many. BUt you get some nice things.
---
and there's still all the world and social etc challenges as well. Plus they added more challenges.
---
Buy or make a weapon for level 5-10 instead and keep it tucked away
---
I know right and I'm sorry I haven't spent hours in game to carry a weaker gun to just tag enemies to help others get kills without one shotting everything. 
---
It sounds harsh but these days high levels can't do anything right. No matter which complaint we listen too
---
I faced the same problem. I started to use perk which allow you to repair weapons to 200% durability (don't remember it's name, but it is in Intelligence category).
---
Now i have to repair my weapons twice less frequently and it is no more as annoying as it was
---
Lucky Break ( Luck Perk) Gunsmith Rank 5 (Intelligence Perk) also may have to change your build to carry 5 demo expert +5 gunsmith +3 nerd rage. If your a Bloody Big guns build I d suggest less agility and more ain’t Imo
---
but it would have been funny and might have taught them a valuable lesson. 
---
Or not.
---
The grenade that feeds yer gut and kills yer enemies!  A Gutbomb!
---
Well. I have a simple tactic. What i do is i shoot at the parts of it and basically cripple it so it slows down and comes lower and then BOOWM!
---
Thank you.
---
They did not say you would get the same amount of atoms. They say in their faq that there are less atoms available. A total of 2000 over the 10 weeks I believe. All of the old player challenges still give atoms though.
---
&gt; i have about 20 nuc cards stocked up for when i want to do a nuke run.
---
Unfortunately you can't really stockpile large quantities of them.  
---
They weigh 1 pound each, there's no perk in the game that reduces their weight, and they're a misc item not a junk item so they will always consume inventory space no matter where you store them.
---
Once I found 50 of them stuffed in the ice machine outside the Rusty Pick. I picked them all up and instantly regretted it, lol.
---
That would be hacked, surely?
---
Doesn't exist as far as I know.
---
Thank you for doing the hard work for me. I’ll be tweeting my build in a bit.
---
You have a social menu, not sure what the button presses to get to it are on PS4, but check your map, you should see "Social" and the button to press to access it, from there you can accept invites sent by others, join or create a public group and add friends.  
---
You need some kind of mic on your ps4 to talk to others, whether that be attached to a headset, standalone or a ps4 camera.
---
Sounds fun bud. Im in
---
No. Power Armor does not have Legendary affects in FO76. However, there are some "hacked" PA parts floating around with Unyielding on PC.
---
Yes, there is hacked legendary power armor.
---
The only time I've ever seen this happen is when a new server is spun up and you just happen to be one of the first on it. If you wait a few minutes you'll find it quickly fills with more players.
---
Never had an empty server since I started playing this game
---
I would 100% agree with this, except for the fact that you can buy your way to level 100. Having the Jangles stein should mean something, it should be a reward for putting a ton of time and effort into the game. But I guarantee that if you grind your way through the whole board and put the Jangles stein out in your camp, everyone will just assume you bought the final levels.
---
I mean they could at least make the paid rewards cosmetically different, like the Fasnacht masks.
---
Thats what i thought
---
It is not a category. In build mode select a built wall (the inside) and look at top of screen.
---
no one is asking for rewards without playing. Folks are asking for there to be some cushion so if you can’t play for a day or five, like a vacation, you are not at such a big disadvantage. Other games seems to handle this just fine.
---
Yes but it's way easier to dodge
---
Who said they weren't willing to put effort in?  Some people could play an average of 30 minutes a day or more, but mostly at weekends and are too busy on certain weekdays.
---
No problems? curious what shogun you're using haha
---
Take a look.
---
Dude, you are the idiot sitting at home all day not working. Go get a job and quit blaming other players because they don't have time to waste and burn like you do. If someone wants something in the game and they have money it's their right to buy that item. I pay for stuff all the time and I work a lot every day. I'm not going to apologize for being successful while a bunch of lazy gamers are sitting at home trying to "earn" their way to rewards. You have 24 hours in a day like everyone else, if the only thing your using your time for is gaming, then that's on you, it's no one else's fault you don't have job and that you aren't living a great life. Stop blame others, face the music, and change your life!
---
I killed 10 things and got 136 per kill and then put the card on and got 146.
---
So it kinda works as i only got 10 extra xp instead of 14 (beth like to round things up). but. Whatevers.
---
There seems to be what looks like a mic on the handset do you think I just need to plug in headphones 🤷🏼‍♀️
---
I'm now nearly level 5. Is that good?
---
this is not fallout 4 this is online with 23 people the game needs to render thing all time not yours but all the others stuff too. the 4x4 foundation keeps track of that to tell the engine what things can be rendered in the area
---
you can build whatever you want in f4 yes bc its  your save  there is no pussy_destroyer96 that would randomly put a camp in the same place as yours
---
It kinda feels like psychological torture from something I'm supposed to enjoy. And don't get me wrong, I'm not hating on your post, your method is sound. It's more so the idea that it would take creating a build like this and playing in a manner wholly different than usual to achieve results. Especially when it's already set up to where Bethesda is telling me "aww, your sad little ass could spent enough time playing our game to get the thing you want? Well ok, you can just buy it, *if* you also buy everything else in between."
---
I was actually excited when this dropped but there is literally only a couple of rewards I like and they are near the end of the game board. With family, job and real life to attend to, I just can grind like this and as a lifelong Fallout fan, it feels like punishment.
---
Screw this mess, I'm gonna go put frogs in jars.
---
As an FYI, many of those NW dailies can be done quite easily. Like, the three camp build one can be done within 5 seconds of loading in.  The creature kills one is also easy.
---
Im struggling with ammo alot. In the early stages and even now on level 50. What helps is getting the perks (i forgot what its called but its an INT perk) that gives you 10-40% (lvl1-3) on ammo production in workbenches
---
Oh and you'll wanne start lifting, bro
---
I do not see the other repeatable, that will come this week (and it will replace the xp one for a week), if beth said the truth.
---
Aye true enough, but I usually can't be arsed to swap the files and stuff as I run mods.
---
Ah, I’m guessing the coder of the app will update as needed. I’m impressed someone did the damn thing at all. :)
---
Gauss shotgun BAYBEEEEEEEEEEE 
---
That's probably why i have no problems tbh. the range no that thing is naughty.
---
BUT even on other characters when i was using a rifle or something, concentrated fire brought it down easy enough.
---
This. I run with a full set of 3 star SS armor, despite being a huge PA fan. PA just can't compete with regular legendary armor sets, which is ridiculous.
---
also rank 18; according to the other dude with the SCORE calculator, we're both totally fine. I think they're a day off on the numbers or don't have the double SCORE weekend. don't worry about it.
---
Brain Bombs! +3 INT for 90 minutes... If you have the Herbivore mutation, it's +6. If you're on a team with someone else who has a mutation, it's +7.5.
---
Yes, but only on PC..
---
The overecnumered bug seems to be fixed, it's not forcing me to go to Vault 76 anymore
---
As for the other 2, idk
---
Check leader of the pack event in the forest area, spawns 3 legendary wolfes all lvl 10 or so. It pops very often, it a great way for fresh characters to get gear also
---
Watoga High, Lewisburg on the Picnic tables, Morgantown High  - plastic pumpkins.  Cue balls   - various places, Tenpins ( regular lot at the Freakshow on trailer), plates by ROSE, scraping energy weapons, cigarette cartons are in many trashbins / dispensers
---
So all over really.. Watoga High is the best single location though, &amp; join the Monster Mash while you at it. Love that event.
---
Sods law they change it to the 'complete events' one at that time
---
Yeah it is good.
---
If I do the NW ones, ill be done at the 57th day and if I skip them, I'll be done at the 64th day.
---
So, I can skip a few then :)
---
If you have to, wait till the end. Its 150 atoms per level regardless of what the level is, at the end each level is near 3k exp vs 1.5k exp so its better off using atoms to fast track later, rather than sooner.
---
Borderlands 2 was greath, never really got into BL3
---
Also at 16. As I've said before I'm not aiming for 100 though.
---
I can't take a shit without the convoy flying overhead. My CAMP is actually under the spawn line of travel so I get them on the reg.
---
Im gonna start selling them for cheap to save people the hassle of having to chase them across the map. What're they worth? I've never heard of them being an issue for anyone but melee peeps.
---
Max level supermutants gonna reward around 1k exp per kill, with max stacked int and exp buff, but why include this, cuz *bethesda is bad hurr durr*
---
I've gotten gold star on dailies without playing NW
---
Where did they confirm this ?because their faq says it is BEYOND completing challenges.
---
Best I've done so far is 5th then running into the fire to cheat someone of the kill
---
Funniest moment is someone crawling into the same bush as me, failing to see me then moving on lol.

What's worse is that 3 star legendary PA is definitely possible. Hackers were selling 3 star vanguard X-01 and T-60 sets a while back.  
---
It's not difficult to do for them at all, but it's a deliberate design decision.  
---
As a sidenote, oddly enough those 3 star legendary PA suits aren't being wiped by bethesda. I know someone who has been using one for months.  
---
I find that odd, as it should be a trivial thing to launch a DB search for people with 3 star PA and remove all of those, since it shouldn't exist altogether.  
---
I mean, it's not like we're talking about duped items that technically could be obtained legally from a drop instead, and thus are harder to find. These are items that shouldn't be in the game at all, yet even tracking and wiping that is too difficult &lt;.&lt;
---
When you get a head set there is a metal piece at the end of the wire where you stick it in the PS4 controller. There are a couple of holes in the controller however shove it in the round one at the bottom of the controller.
---
After you have done so you need to head to setting in game and go to audio to adjust the sound you receive you receive via headset.
---
It is not impressive at all when a Mirelurk hatchling can take you out as you fight the SBQ.
---
How does it hurt you in **this** game?
---
yeah took a lot of crafting and scrapping before it was learnt.
---
Think only the Tesla automat mod tic took longer to learn. but what a glorious mod it is.
---
can mod for you. on XB. noman za
---
So heads up, this happened to me at someone else, it could be that the points were awarded when you reached 3 out of the 5 challenge objectives, not 5/5. It’s weird but I was able to confirm that this happened to me.
---
I'm pretty sure it says do 5 dailies, so there's 5 regular challenges and that one NW daily. So you don't miss out on that gold star challenge, but you're missing out on a lot of SCORE.
---
The quest line with the astronaut is still glitched...I'm supposed to return to her in the abandoned bunker but she doesn't do anything...I'm on Xbox
---
Its like Mr Todd forces you to grind. In any mmo if you are willing yo put time and effort you get a reward, if you dont, you just dont get it, dailys are 1-2 hours max per day. Stack int a go hunt those mutants
---
Ahhh I think you're right, i have 2 "magic' shotguns, a DB and pump that do more per shot damage in vats than anything I've used, but have seeerious rubber band issues when it comes to flying mobs, it's incredibly frustrating sprinting and jumping around like a mad man to finally land a shot on a scorchbeast or cargobot only to have their health immediately regen, every, damn, time.
---
OH FUCK YES
---
#RIP AND TEAR!!
---
I don't have anger issues...
---
Ill settle for high level magicians not performing magic tricks on sbq
---
On PC? IGN? I would visit your shop :)
---
You’re lucky. Those numbers sounded like mine until I saw I had entered the wrong data. Mine punches me out at 69 days from today and that’s a generous estimate. Just now I added more xp per day and it still puts me at 99. But 150 caps for one missing level isn’t bad.
---
I recently sold 12 of mine for 900c each
---
One of the nw challenges was stay alive for 30 mins... Urgh!
---
Just my opinion, not worth it. The tent is great, but I don't do private world's, and won't now with the added teams bonus's. The atoms are great every month buts just cosmetics in the atom shop. Everyone likes different things though, I agree with the other people in this thread to try it for month and see what you think.
---
haven't done mine either. Am keen to run yours and help with mine too?
---
Don't have a clue but we can be clueless together. should be fun.
---
14, not bad for a few hours a day I think, i think I am having more fun with the public team to ne honest!
---
Apparently you have to bash them with your weapon
---
I swear i saw someone on here say that with the flamer you have to actually bash things to heal them.
---
To be honest, Excavator and X-01 also use separate slits.  
---
Technically even T-60, T51 and T45 also have separate slits. They have a tiny separator in the middle.  
---
Having used VR googles, it'd definitely be possible to have clear view even with those separate eyeslits. And from a protection standpoint it would actually be better to have a display on the inside and a camera to see the outside rather than eyeslits, let alone a single visor.
---
Highest tier? Hmm, i think some handmade and auto lasers can out perform the fixer any day. The fixer has its qualities for stealth but you could hardly call any weapon chambered in .45 a high tier weapon, especially for a commando. Also, handmade does more dmg right off the rip.
---
Thanks for asking, Kyle!
---
It hurts me because it is a waste of my precious time and ammo to be dealing with spawns caused by leechers.
---
Its not a mic, its a speaker.
---
There’s 1500 total atoms to be earned in the entire season.
---
I hear you bub. Fallout Fortnite is not something I care to play and should not be part of these challenges.
---
Been doing all daily challenges, filled week one and I only skipped NW one.
---
I only got to second perk card. Kinda depressing
---
Don't forget the 15% radiation resistance and 7% damage reduction per piece of PA.  
---
That's an invisible bonus in the game.
---
When you're in edit mode (not build mode), look at the inside face of the wall and at the top there should be a "wallpaper" tab. It's R1 to change on PS4, not sure on PC.
---
19...
---
I made a bow build as well but I'm noticing something odd... Sometimes the arrows just fly trough the NPCs and deal no damage. If I hit their limbs it's the same.
---
Mine isn't one of the magic ones. It's just OP as flip. With the scorchbeasts i just let them land and then i slap the life out of them.
---
I am on PC. I will go check her out. I think you actually have to kill them rather than be handed to them. I dont know. Let me see and I will get back to you.
---
Not w/ both, no.
---
My friend‘s camp has got a lead extractor. It is located northwest of Lake Eloise.
---
There is a junk pile just on the side of the road at the Top of the World.
---
Probably the same way its been done for ages now, nuke mine(s), so you died to radiation, dude stole your loot so you don't get a quest or marker for finding your lost loot. Prob removes the death marker off the screen too, 100% sure about that one. If there are other ways to kill players, I'm not 100% sure, but the nuke mine trick was being used on people afking Fasnacht back in may.
---
Oh yeah I've had that happen one or two times. Really gets the blood pumping especially when you don't have a gun lol
---
That and you can load multiple arrows
---
Yeah this is what i do, an explosive shot to their faces then i copy their camping
---
Damn i was gonna go like 50 caps lol I keep about 10 because silos are such a bitch (even when you have the run memorised) I'd hate to not have a backup card or two incase I got a bum code.
---
That the one near the Mono Rail pylon above the red rocket? Checked that spit no dice.
---
Can anyone confirm if the perk just cares about being IN a team rather than the team containing actual other players? (i.e. if its just you in a public team does it work?)
---
Oh I see i think the PS4 came with that and I never used it and I can’t find it so I guess I have to buy one
---
So the survival tent feels cheap. I use it but if I didnt have it its nbd. The scrap box though that's a game changer. Tbh all you have to do is pay for 1 month. Collect everything you can the. Cancel your sub. After that all you need to do is collect screws and ballistic fibers.
---
The spawns are exactly the same whether they are there or not. Them being afk does not impact the event whatsoever. 
---
How are they making you waste ammo? It’s the same as if hey weren’t at the event at all.
---
Nuke mines have been fixed to prevent that as said in the patch notes...maybe. I have not tested it.
---
Definitely not. But we had lots of drunk Germans who we call „blue“ in Germany.
---
Heavy yes. Not sure about stabilize
---
Yeah PC, IGN: Xevious_Red
---
On now
---
Don’t forget the Scorchbeast Queen!  They acknowledged her not being able to be crippled a couple months ago.
---
Thats pretty stupid. 
---
Timegating by dailies instead of actual time played makes seasons systems like this not fun, but a chore.
---
A videogame shouldnt be effort like a fucking child, because being forced to play at least 30-60 min every day is not sustainable for most adults. 
---
If i want to play 10 hours a day on weekends, why the hell should i be denied of the daily score of the week. After all im putting the same playtime and efforts in, just in one day, rather than spread out.
---
Would hurt absolutely noone if you could repeat missed challanges, if you are done for the day/week. Warframe does the same and it works great.
---
I don‘t know why but in 700+ hours I‘ve only experienced one camp where I just spawned in the concrete foundations. 
---
Never any trap camps.
---
Alright, ty. I was looking for a junkies flamer but I wasn't sure it'd be affected like the rest of my heavy weapons
---
**30**. Grinding at \~350k XP per day. lvl 663 atm. At this rate, I'll complete the race in [22 days](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/score.html?nonw&amp;level=663&amp;percent=0&amp;days=70&amp;xpgain=350000&amp;startrank=30&amp;dblxps=10&amp;dblxpe=15&amp;dblscs=17&amp;dblsce=23&amp;weeklyat=2).
---
However, there are signs that the next week will replace the *score for XP* with *score for public events*. It takes me about 20 minutes to grind 100 score for XP. I'm not sure about doing an event every 20 minutes.
---
Jealous! i can't wait to finish the rep grind to finally get my hands on one.
---
Sounds fair and reasonable yeah won't happen
---
No problem getting them down with my Gatling Laser or Gauss Minigun. They often cross my camp, close to the Top of the World.
---
I don’t go into details about glitches here, per the sub rules. You can look on YouTube and probably find it.
---
Just drop them if you don’t use them? 
---
The game barely holds together as it is and you people want MOTORCYCLES??
---
I could potentially see Vertibird rides with the BOS returning but that’s about the extent of it. And lord knows what happens if all 16 people on the server try it simultaneously...
---
And the daily 'level up' is finally not annoying to do
---
in NW sure but not in normal mode, gotta get a quad for that effect
---
I do. I just was making a point in regards to the situation to illustrate the concept. 
---
Those who don’t like to play NW don’t have to worry about chasing down that particular 250 SCORE daily when it shows up.
---
I actually just tested the perk with the same weapon without the Napalmer mod and it works. I guess this is a PSA that friendly fire doesn’t work with the napalm tank, which Is stupid. It would be nice in Radiation Rumble to cook ghouls and heal the scavengers. The damage without the Napalmer tank is roughly half (150 vs 300). I wonder if this is a bug.
---
Nope. There are more spawns the more people there are, at least on that event.
---
If you are solo, only one of the pipes will be attacked at a time, normally by one mob. If you are multiple people, all pipes an be attacked at the same time, and it is always multiple mobs attacking them.
---
Sorry, Kyle. You are wrong on this one.
---
Thank you very much sir, i did not notice that before you mentioned it here.
---
A wish you a nice day, or night to you sir.
---
Stash box works too, like how multiple people can use one at vendors. The box just links to your respective stash storage.
---
842 hours myself and only just came across my first trap camp today, was pretty simple, guy had a hole over a huge drop and it was covered in confetti, thank god for jetpacks, is all I can say.
---
Why are you bringing bulk junk on a west-tek run..?
---
This is a fucking nightmare.
---
Yeah I noticed it today. My friend's light seemed brighter than mine and it turns out the helmet light cancels the pip boy light and is slightly brighter.
---
When I realized how terrible the buy rate was for 2mm I was a little sad because I was hoping to have something else offset the fact that the damn ammo generating machine (buy with bullion from raiders once hitting ally status) can't generate 2mm.
---
Now I just use the ammo converter for fuel. 100 points/20 fuel isn't too bad.
---
I believe it's called "weapon artisan" :-)
---
Hot garbage ever since the fashnacht update
---
Well if your aren’t going bloody, meaning 20% health the you might look to Vanguard for great armor protection.  SS armor you get with new Wastelanders after you finish and grind for bullion.  Then you craft one, using legendary pieces you get from purveyor and it is like a roll of the dice.  You can get lucky, or burn through a lot to get what you want.  SS is the highest damage resistance non-PA armor in the game.  You can also make PA armor, buy mods.  I suggest you do some research first as some love the new PA, some seriously regret the investment.  I wouldn’t rush into that collect bullion first and easy experience
---
*whispers quietly*
---
You know, it's possible to participate in events and help out and also not one shot everything in sight.  Also i don't think anyone has ever complained about one shotting the ticks at tea time so this is a total strawman lol
---
Yeah can be early on. May be a good idea to spend a little time looking up tips for making caps and hitting player vendors too, you can usually find ammo in vendors for 1c each depending on what you're using, never pay more than that. Other than that there may be people willing to help, if you're on PS4 I can craft you a load if you want for free.
---
Hi thanks for your help, turns out it was the firewall blocking the game and seems to be all running smoothly now!
---
Absolutely worth it. Had it now for like 300 hours or something and i still blow myself up no and then. 
---
Once they fix the missing in vats issue it'll be even better. 
---
2mm ec is easy to make as well. But it weighs quite a bit.
---
Bonus Intelligence.  Every bit helps.
---
Even without stealth, the Fixer only just out performs the Handmade rifle! It has a hidden damage buff built in that pushes it past the handmade!
---
They're now fallout 1st.
---
Oh shit, I must have missed that one. What about explosive bait? Did they mention any fixes to that? If it is classed as environmental damage, can it be used to kill AFKs?
---
For the pure damage output TSE used to have, B/E is the way to go. It’s a glass cannon, but kills things very well. I found junkies to be lackluster compared to it, but that’s just me. 
---
Are you on PC? If so, I might have some extra gear you can try out.
---
Or armour.
---
Or anything.
---
Best now 3rd place then ended by an assaultron
---
That’s something I’ve not been doing yet as I haven’t the perk cards to support any weapon that’s not a bow(don’t have one that’s remotely useful) will get my self a decent fist weapon someday for this purpose. 
---
And I’ve already striped them of all there rifle ammo got like 800 5.56 (like 10-15 mins worth of combat is heavy)left hopeing it’s enough to take hemlock holes later for acid . But it’s feeling a lot like I stoped playing fallout and started playing Ammo crafter 76 .
---
Level 150 still have issues lol
---
Last I checked I’m coming up on 1000 hours played and I’ve come across close to half a dozen trap camps, this is the only one that didn’t work haha
---
Sneak bonus plus a hidden 10% damage buff! You can also get legendary ones from the scrip merchant after learning the plan!
---
Yeah it has a light on it, it can be a little too bright at times.
---
My Vintage Nukashine stock is ready.
---
I will be just outside Vault 76.
---
I have not seen any notes about orbital or bait. So not sure.
---
You said in another comment you need the XP? More mobs for you to kill = more xp, and it's not like ammo is in short supply. 
---
The lvl 200 may not need the xp and just want the treasury notes, so is leaving the xp for you.
---
I like it too now my charisma perks are even more useful than ever.
---
Had tons of great fun doing events.
---
Now all we need is level normalisation so everyone gets w fair chance
---
What colour is it please?
---
I've been using a Miner's Helmet with a bright headlamp with a similar problem. Think I'd prefer the look of the Secret Service Helmet, honestly, at least for a while, since I can't get a Scout Mask to save my life.
---
im just here for the wallpaper
---
That’s 5-10lbs I don’t want to carry. 
---
Tea Time provides bank notes, only reason I play it. As soon as they remove that reward, I’ll go back to ignoring it and let the new players run it or not. Until then, remember.... no Russian.
---
Ah the rumoured 'friends'
---
It isn't fixed.
---
Because good challenging gameplay shouldnt come from gimping myself.
---
I'm at level 99 as of this post.
---
But then I woke up and reality bitch slapped me back to 14. 
---
Mildy inconvenient.
---
Doesn't someone else entering the area cause the mobs to respawn? Could be innocent. Or the person used explosive bait, although I'm not entirely sure how that works.
---
Said the same thing and got called entitled by some dipshit on the trader sub glad to see people are actually not idiots here.
---
16
---
The only selling point for me would be private server.
---
Inventory management really is not a problem once you 'get the hang'' of the game. Atoms are nice but not a deal breaker. Playing to earn them adds to my enjoyment.
---
This is not true. I'm levelling an alt now and completed strange bedfellows and I haven't even stepped foot in the Mire yet. I haven't even done Roses' main story quests.
---
Seems fine to me..
---
Same as a normal power armour headlamp as far as I remember, I have it, but I don't use it. I'm currently using the flyboy helmet which has a headlamp on it, its not as bright and I quite like it, however it is bugged in third person.
---
I'd like to 'subscribe' -- via activating the quest to the dailies I usually do, events I like to participate in, etc. and have them go active in the pipboy whenever they start. 
---
I hate joining a server seconds after the blast and finding out the SBQ is done a minute later.
---
I feel ya bud.
---
I use the 10mm submachine gun (Mainly because it looks like a boltcaster :) ) and 10mil is one of the most dropped ammo i find and still run out in 4 hours after making like 1100 rounds
---
On the bright side. Keeps you thinking i guess
---
It keeps sending me to random points on the map at the cost of 50+ caps, with no Vault respawn at all!
---
easy enough to miss
---
"content" like this should never be behind a grid, time gate or with the mystery of never being able to get it if you don't. It's fine to have time gated content that you can work towards eventually. It's not ok to have all 3 at the same time.
---
 This isn't mmos of 20 years ago. Exclusive content is shit, and will always be shit. Challenges, or tough achievements are fine for this stuff so people have something to feel any sense of accomplishment.
---
You want to burn people out faster? Do this shit.
---
At least 50 percent of my scorched Earth runs resulted in my game freezing up or straight up crashing until I found the super simple mod that would stop it from happening.  Instead of just adding something similar to what the mod did they just turned around and nerfed the armor instead.
---
lol you’re so ridiculous
---
Wow, that's actually worse..
---
How many points is it all up?
---
From what i read, there can only be a fixed amount of robots at a time so ignoreing/sneaking/crippling past quite a few would help reduce number of bots to kill
---
Yuup.
---
How did that work out for you? They put vendors back in, duping is still alive and well. ;)
---
That’s not my name. Have a nice day.
---
Really? I had no idea lol. I don’t use stealth so I’ve never actually used the fixer I just figured it was the combat rifle with a stealth perk. All this time I figured people wanted it because it was just a little harder to get than some other weapons, plus the stealth bonus. In that case, I take that back, the fixer is a high tier commando weapon, I stand corrected.
---
RIP lol
---
I may let my FO1 membership lapse, but getting it was a game changer. Not having to worry about junk/scrap inventory management was huge. Flux too. 
---
Even if you just do it for a month, drop the scrap box, load it up, and let it lapse. You can still pull stuff out of it. If you load it up well enough, you won’t be hurting for materials for a very long time. I’d weep to see exactly how much weight is in mine (I’m thinking it’s pushed past 20k lbs awhile ago)
---
Really sneak perks help every build, its usually the difference between 100 damage and 1000 damage!
---
My agility is 15 and I have all stealth perks. Out of CSA I can still be crouched next to someone and they won't see me. I run vanguard's secret service with one chameleon piece, works good enough for me. I swap into CSA for SBQ and nuke zones.
---
What outfit is given by the settlers?
---
Did many events the past week, didn't get any extra points for them. I don't know if it supposed to give some, but it definitely doesn't give any.
---
those are armor resistance perks not damage % reduction perks
---
also I murder bloodied builds all the time since they are capped at 110 dmg the bloodied effect isn't as big as the faster fire rate and automatic tesla 
---
the reason your dropping dead is you didn't even take the hint I gave you in the first sentence and nope I'm not dropping more
---
Same with plasma frame
---
No kidding. Finally we have at least \*some\* use for them, rather than just dropping them on the ground.
---
It really is. But sneak peeks are not needed imo if you have a max agility. Covert ops may be worth while but I’m already one shotting everything with normal sneak dmg
---
&gt; “I’m so sorry,....
---
What is he sorry about, that he did not kill you?
---
although a better fix for all the useless missiles and nukes would be to, idk, make explosives viable again \*cough cough\*
---
Not really content though is it?  It is just cosmetic rewards mainly.
---
Content would be an expansion or similar.
---
I also dont know why people are so worked up about having to do the dailies - just play the game and enjoy doing what you want to do, the grind is optional.
---
Just so you know, there's a 1000 scrip cap limit (which i reached 1 time on patch 19). Feel free to grind more scrip
---
alright then keep your secrets. There are no flat damage% reduction perks outside of wearing power armor. just damage resistance.
---
Ther should be perk when you aim sighs with PA you can't be stumbled or increase resistance to stumbles
---
Sure, Kyle.
---
On PC here, I haven't had any adventure mode XP earned in NW count towards the weekly repeatable SCORE challenge.
---
I've seen maybe 1 or 2 people on here claim otherwise though, not sure if they're mistaken or it's bugged.
---
Yeah with the Fixer you only need sneak 1 not sneak 3!
---
If you don't want to be 1st forever, don't sub. Its almost impossible to go back to pre-scrapbox...
---
Yesterday I did as many dailies as I could, and it kept only registering as 4/5 dailies. Did 2 more: still 4/5. Same with build shit at a camp - 9/10 floor/wall/roof... kept adding and adding ... nothing. I don’t have time for this shit.
---
Try logging out and back in.  I recently built a small platform to just place a few items in my camp, and after I was done it wouldn't let me delete it.  It was just a base, a stairs, and an upper floor tile.  Not connected to anything but it still said the upper floor tile couldn't be deleted because it would leave part of the structure unaccessible.  I re-logged and it fixed the problem.
---
As someone with 2000 hours in PUBG, I am kinda annoyed how hard solo NW is because TTK is too long.
---
If I am any kind of indicator, it is because the forced NW play from the new score system. However, I'm a water wookie.
---
What I want to know is this: how TF does such a terrible UI get past every internal tester Bethesda has? How do hundreds of employees use that terrible interface, and say "yep, this here is top-shelf. Release it immediately. The players will love it."
---
Either their internal testers are brainless yes-men, or they simply don't do nearly enough of it.
---
Ammosmith  for agility, super duper for luck. I have no knowledge of an int perk except the scrapper to get more scrap from weapons
---
depends, theres alot of crappy legacys out there too, 
---
like one time I traded with a guy, he had a ME laser rifle (lvl40!) and he wanted my B2525 CR, BE50DRWA HM and BE15RL 50. Cal...
---
yeah sure bruh, your gun isnt even worth one of my guns
---
\*2000, there are 10 x 150 atoms but you also get 500 for completing rank 100.
---
I prefer either the Marine Tactical (wetsuit) or Chinese Stealth helmets since they cover the entire head whereas the Scout Mask leaves the hair/neck exposed.  The exposed bits don't fit the aesthetic of the SS armor IMO.  I am too cheap, however, to buy the SS helmet, since it does not add any functional advantage.
---
In any case he do no harm.
---
But same kind of trader Athena will rip you'r base in seconds.
---
With max agi you don’t need any cards with or without the fixer, at least in my experience. I have nothing invested in sneak, just max agi and I remain hidden pretty much all the time
---
Friendly Fire works with the Shishkebab and the Flamer. For healing NPCs, you need to bash them with the flamer, whereas healing other players works with the actual flame as well, according to the dataminers. Not sure how the Napalmer tank influences that behaviour, though.
---
I’m a melee build and I recommend it lol. Don’t have to worry about ammo ever, yay!
---
I’m glad you shared this story because last week, I helped two players below level 10 with Grafton Day. I hoped they didn’t think it was an overstep, but I remembered being a lonely level 10 running away from the level 30 Grafton monster, so I took a few chunks of its HP out and left the rest for the new players. I’ll try to help your ammo plights when I can.
---
just aim better and run harder noob
---
I’m on console so game pad was used. The interface lags and freezes quite a bit. It does run smoother in a private world but I felt it was unfair to test it on a private server since not all players have that option so it was tested in a public world.
---
No worries, and looking back at that post, I didn't intend to come across that harsh. Black powder rifles are a niche weapon that can be a lot of fun. Faster reload is a desired secondary perk for it. I don't think ffr actually does anything on single shot weapons. You want to do the most damage in one shot and for that reason instigating, bloodied or junkies would be the best. Anti-armor would be the next best. Furious is only really useful on faster fire rate weapons.
---
No dice. Killed two. Used butchers perk. Nada. I may have to research to see if they can be given as loot.
---
Never tried it, but I’m surprised tbh 
---
QA is totally fucked on Bethesda’s end. One of the distinct additions was the Archery build and half of it was or is just broken since it’s been implemented. 
---
Explosive bolts sounded fucking awesome, but the aoe deals as much damage as a punch - only the direct hits are useful :/
---
Got it solved, thank you sir.
---
Max agility and 4 pieces of unyielding, with my handmade out, things find me, with my fixer, I can go nose to nose with them!
---
Someone's angry over spilled milk. As someone who bought the game a month ago I want the older skins as well. Chances are I'll never touch them but as a completionist its bothers me that my collection will never be complete. Good on you for paying for 1st since whenever but you just come across as a pretensious asshole. Are you mad that I just got a ghillie suit that they removed from the game in june? What about my newly acquired holiday items? Looks like your not so special anymore for having them when they came out in 2018. Seriously you're getting too worked up over a game, their are other things to lose sleep over than someone wanting a few cosmetics that dont effect your life or gameplay experience.
---
Just tried it...it has been fixed. When I tried to back away from Rocksy, I was locked in place.
---
Too bad.
---
More grinding then.
---
does this factor in the Double Score weekend? They announced that there's 4 days at the end of this month where the dailies will all give twice as much score.
---
No prob. How does it look? I want the camp items in the season more than anything else.
---
If this is accurate then I am only one level behind. Jesus this is a lot of work especially for a player who hates NW. It did force me to participate in it because they are simple tasks except reviving players. I am terrible at PVPs so I didn’t even bother trying that particular task.
---
they definitely can be given as loot, from that deathclaw specifically. it drops every fourth or fifth time
---
At 17, would be 18 if not for those pesky NW challenges.
---
I think he felt bad because he had to confront me, I’m not sure but he kept apologizing again and again. He said it was his first attempt at a trap camp so maybe he still had a little dignity left haha
---
That sucks man. I found out about the video the first night but I already did the daily a hour before so I waited and the next time I messed it up then another time the guy died and the last time I finally got it. The first time I didn’t think it was going up so I just gave up but it did go up just really slow. From normal grind and keeping the gold from all of them I got to neighborly pretty quick with them but that glitched helped me get to alley. Sorry it was to late for you
---
Seems like poison and ignite is the way to go, plasma is goos for goo piles tho, radiowaste junk or how it called in english
---
Level 185 here - I burn through 5.56, always running short.
---
I like to see a good trap camp.
---
I rarely carry any junk on me so dying has no consequences
---
any interest in added the rewards?  made a similar sheet with reward levels copy/pasted from the fallout wiki.  Are you able to add smart calculations that take in to account level unlocks by atoms?  For example, with my hypothetical atoms my 100% is level 87.
---
Running Demo expert lvl 5 I get the most damage with explosive bolts though. Guess it depends if it’s worth the perk point investment.
---
And for me as well, just got it this morning!
---
Been experimenting with other stuff, especially with public teams and card sharing. Just been picking a bunch of semi decent one stars that may help like thru hiker or marathoner if someone else already has strange in numbers shared.
---
Im still at 2.. do I have a chance?
---
Really? Because I’m built the same way lol even 4 uny pieces and I sneak pretty efficiently. I have heard sneak is bugged, don’t know if that could be affecting it. I also may have one piece with improved sneak but I can’t remember if I switched it out since I don’t primarily use stealth. I just don’t feel I need the sneak dmg all the time, every enemy is so trivialized at this point:/
---
Then I will keep at it. Thanks.
---
If the Nuclear Winter bug for these additional holiday rewards hasn't been fixed by then this'll be a great time to pick em up.
---
Engine wise, I think it needs to load the world to determine if your camp placement is ok. So you would still be in a load screen regardless of if your camp could be placed (world loaded) or not.
---
Like I said last night I got the gold star challenge withour NW one complete. So I only lost 250 score. I didn't wana do it. Was going to get gold star but it gave it to me.
---
I will have to still disagree.   If you are not subbed for the month that a reward comes out you should not be able to get it.  You can word it anyway you want but in the end you are still asking to get something that you didn't pay for.
---
 I have been a sub since it came out every single month. I received those monthly rewards because I was an active member.
---
 I will stand firm you don't deserve or should not get a monthly reward you did not pay for. Period.
---
I haven't been playing every day and I'm at level 12. 
---
I get my Well Rested buff 5%, make Cranberry Relish 10%, use Lvl 3 Inspirational 15%, and join  any Events team (25% to 100%) prior to finishing a quest. If there isn't a team, I make one to at least get the 25% buff (I need to check to see if Inspirational still procs even if you're a team of one, I don't think it does though).
---
At 100% on Events I'm getting 3,520 xp for completing Scorched Earth/SBQ. 
---
I've been picking up every rinky-dink event I can to milk that Event group buff. 
---
I don't think lvl 100 for the Legendary Run is insurmountable. You just might have to change how you normally play a bit.
---
Yeah, I put white knight in there just as a placeholder. Waiting to see if they blow this off for a long time like they did to Gun-fu.
---
I’d love new content, actually challenging and fresh content but I can’t rely on bethesda. It is more fun starting a new character doing something like I said than it is grinding for days and weeks to get a new cosmetic that I won’t use.
---
Hopefully tho there will be a lot of people setting off nukes to do SBQ to get legendary weekly. Cause I gotta get 4 legendary kills
---
I'd be happy if they all produced at the same rate as 556. Plus I wish they'd add railway spikes harpoons and 2mm.
---
Improved sneak legendary armor was probably making up the difference yeah,that legendary effect is more op than people give it credit!
---
I'm currently using a 1 star bloodied pipe for most of the map, low vats cost higher vats accuracy than both the hanade and fixer so can just 1 pop heads for most enemies!
---
Save my non legendary Fixer, and be handmade for real threats.
---
Thanks for the help anyway. Not too much longer I hope.
---
Ah that's a shame.  Well they will have to address cross accounts sooner or later with the introduction of the next gen. 
---
Or maybe not. It's a shame as being tied to one platform for purchases and progression does have it limitations.
---
Honestly I'm not hopeful. Shame because that card is great but may as well use something else rather than something that's broken.
---
Did you try turning on your microphone and using your words?
---
How cab I fix this on xbox? I havent been able to play in weeks. I have a brand new xbox one x and still cant play. I've never used mods or anything at all and Bethesda wont respond to my ticket.
---
"Disconnected due to having modified game files"
---
I don't use a mic. So no.
---
Forgot about that dmg buff!
---
There is almost always a Grafton Monster by the farm on the outside of Morgantown. (The one Biv sends you to.)
---
"Whoever created the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ skin is lazy and never bothered testing it" is something than can be said about countless cosmetics in this game.
---
Or flamer fuel or plasma cores or you know fking ultracite that half of the fucking playerbase uses.
---
This is correct.  Shiskebabs work as one would expect, with Flamers you need to bash NPC's but not players.
---
Remember people, you can just PAY for some extra rank ups.
---
Yes. Hell I'd buy extra plans with bullion for ultracite recipes. But we're probably getting outside the realm of Bethesdas programming skills.😂😂
---
my American math says you get 7500 pts from weeklies, not 6500.
---
I am probably imagining it but I feel like they stay in the area if the vertibots are still in play. I try and target the cargobot and ignore the vertibots and dont have the issue of them pissing off. Final Word works well on taking them down pretty quick
---
Out of 76, and straight into a ditch!
---
I'd like to see them without having to click 10 different options
---
I really-assigned it on every character, even perks I wouldn’t normally use (from past perk packs) are better than a perk that doesn’t work at all. When they fix it, I’ll swap back to it. Why WOULDNT you?
---
Me and my parter have somehow spawned in my floors before, luckily only a handful of times. We can’t figure it out.
---
I think the dailies should not be a set number. I actually hate to use Fortnite as an example of anything.  The dailies in that game are in a "slot"  You get the full  xp amount on the first completion of that slot. Everytime you finish a daily a new daily pops in but it is only worth 10% of the full amount. 
---
If Bethesda would do something similar I would be OK with it. 250 from the first tine you complete that "slot" then 25 for each dialy in that slot after. So in theory the dailies would give you 1500 score for the first six loaded to you then each replacement would be 25 score. It would be better in my opinion.
---
I'm almost level 19 so I'm good so far thanks op
---
2
---
I carry a perfect storm to mark mobs, but even unspec'ed it rapes.  I guess I could run around with a lvl1 pipe revolver, but seriously, would YOU enjoy that?  I sure wouldn't.
---
What are you guys talking about? The daily challenges are, besides the "level up" one, which is completely dependent on your level (just make a new character if you are too high) finished in 20 minutes. If you have to find a legendary enemy, you are a little bit luck dependent, but there are even events with guaranteed legendary enemies.
---
And what makes you think, that you have to finish the race? I don't get the mindset. You are a casual gamer with limited playtime? Fine, do your thing and play the game, you will get at least 20-50 SCORE level along the way. And those rewards don't vanish if you can't finish the whole thing. Why does this SCORE system makes your playing WORSE than before?
---
The whining about this system is really getting out of hand. Every person with a little bit of common sense sees it as a nice bonus with nice rewards just for playing. There is literally nothing bad or malicious about the system, you can get EVERYTHING for free. 
---
And why do all people think, that you are entitled to ALL rewards with every playstyle? When you are not investing enough time into this game (which is absolutely fine, it is your choice) you will not be able to reach stage 100, and this is absolutely fine, too.
---
I think it was ammosmith. I had the special wrong. My bad :D
---
Thankfully I have enough unused level ups that I can mess around with. Second it’s fixed I’m switching back :)
---
Will DM you
---
Same man. I have a legendary handmade for dealing with scorched. I can barely use it. I don't find 5.56 anywhere either
---
It's ok, i only ocd on grammar
---
Oh you meant re-assigning your Agility stat? Ah, I can understand why you might not want to mess with your build. Thought you meant the points spent on the Adrenaline perk!
---
It takes at least 2 solid hours a day.  Not everyone has that time.  
---
I'm level 19, have done every challenge and grinded for a few hours at least every night.  It's not looking good.
---
I have 12 INT, canned meat stew, max perk for inspirational, well rested.  Dailies alone should reward the amount, not additional grind too.  We will see how I get once the higher levels require more exp to progress.
---
In that case. I apologise already ;)
---
Quad loads 1 bolt each.
---
Source: have 2 Quads for 8 rapid-fire bolts.
---
It does seem a little sad that people who have work or commitments etc miss out on certain rewards.
---
OH WELL you know they'll be on sale in the atom shop in a few months.... better get playing to earn those atoms!
---
When someone picks up your death bag, the quest to retrieve it disappears. The "Last Death" marker will sometimes not show up either I've noticed... It has been this way since BETA for me.
---
From the initial [announcement of Seasons](https://fallout.bethesda.net/ko/article/fPSas0ftnlgD0FcZNnMoL/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-introducing-the-2020-roadmap-and-76-seasons): 
---
*Q: Are Season rewards exclusive to Season progression, or will I be able to get them in other ways?*
---
*A: The rewards are limited during a Season to the players who earn them through progression, and we are exploring other ways we may make certain rewards available in the future.*
---
So it seems like they're aware of this issue. I don't mind pure cosmetics being season-exclusive, but functional stuff like the Ammo Converter probably should be obtainable even after the season ends.
---
kick 'em or leave if you don't want them following you
---
&gt; you can get EVERYTHING for free.
---
Because this replaced the atoms i could earn for free and now atoms are hidden away between all the useless stuff they are giving away.
---
Either/or. I have a ton of unused level ups, so it’s not too big of a deal. I have a few agility and AP refresh perks on my armor so the loss of agility points won’t be too badly missed.
---
I don't understand these types of posts.  Either you care about the cosmetics enough to do the tasks and earn them or you don't.  It's just cosmetics.  No one needs to have every single cosmetic, and if you do, you better be willing to put in the time.  If everyone has everything then nothing is special or unique and that's boring.
---
Furthermore, these "challenges" are laughably easy and can be completed in a few minutes of play time.  Don't want to miss out?  Complete your pass.  It's just that simple.
---
Don't do it
---
I bet if they do reassembly required it fixes the problem.
---
Are those holiday skins locked behind a subscription service?  No.  Your argument is invalid. O.P. wants subscription only items, without paying for the subscription.  What's so hard to understand about this?  When the money from the subs starts to go down, then maybe they'll release them to non-paying customers.
---
That is the burden of legacy energy weapons.
---
I'm level 16 currently. I've lost. 2000 score due to weekly challenges breaking in me.
---
Wtf am I gonna do?! :( I really wanted that fireplace.
---
Yeah I agree.. really like putting my 4 CHA to more/different use. XP grinding all of a sudden is a big thing. So I am kinda glad having INT 8 since ever..
---
34 right not
---
Having work or commitments is part of being an adult.  This means you may not get every single cosmetic in a video game a couple times in your life. 
---
This is ok.  It's how things are supposed to work.
---
Ah OK. I play on PC, but use a Logitech Gamepad to play. I used to be all about the mouse and keyboard but since Skyrim and Fallout 4... And having my PC hooked up to the 60" in the living room, doesn't make a great position to play with keyboard and mouse.
---
As your research pointed out, and based on my experiences, the terminal isn't that bad (still it could be improved) but I wonder if those who have a real issue with it are trying to use their mouse for the menus.
---
True. But it would be easier to just let other people know you're not willing to babysit.
---
Agreed.  It would go a long way if those players would instead get on mic and explain the proper way to do things in a nice way.  
---
Yes it can be frustrating sometimes when players are running around like headless chickens doing more harm than good but thats no reason to insult people.
---
Magic Junkie (Junkie with 200+ w/o explosive effect, 100+ w/ explosive effect) probably have better DPS than Bloodied.
---
go into your perks as if you're gonna change them and when you're on a card it will say share at the bottom. you need 3 points of charisma per level of the card. And if you see a crd with a chain on it it means it's being shared with you.
---
What about new players who get the game after the season? 
---
Lets day this game is around for years to come someone who joins next year will have missed multiple seasons.
---
What about causal players who care but don't have the time, some have work, families and so on and maybe only get to play a few hours a week on maybe a day off.
---
My point is plenty of scenarios where have content that can be earned once and never again becomes an issue.
---
I'd be okay if after some time if the cosmetic rewards get added to the game in another way that people can earn so they are not permanently locked out. 
---
I would not be okay with them being sold for atoms, there's enough of that already.
---
I will easily finish this season.  However, none of the items particularly appeal to me.  The Cosmo armor or whatever is ugly AF, the ammo converter is useless and I don't need a playground in my base.  I'm not trying to attract children.  The power armor skin is pretty decent, but I already have 50 power armor skins that I don't use.  My point is, I think my time and atoms are better spent just enjoying the game and buying what I want from the store when I see something I like.  I already can see that this grind doesn't interest me in the future.  It takes away from me just having fun and exploring, and makes the game work instead of play.  The gold grind has already turned the game into a redundant grind for pictures/ward's lost crap/some former raider.. over and over and...  Now they've added the firm arm twist for us all to hurry over and "enjoy" nuclear winter.  I don't.  I wish they would stop.  The direction this game is taking is one that leads to burnout and boredom.  That is never good for any title.
---
Wait, there's a text chat option? When? Where? How do I access it?
---
I'm playing other games until it's fixed. I'm more interested in season 21 for diablo3 than this season, so it worked out for me.
---
That could be. I do know that processing/lag is an issue. Terminals transition much faster on PC. If console was the same way I feel some of the frustration would be reduced across the community. 
---
I’m assuming on the next gen consoles coming out this game will run smoother since they have faster and more powerful hardware.
---
If you use a tesla as a main weapon you’re shit at pvp tbh
---
This makes me extremely confident I made the right choice over a year ago to set everybody's mic volume on 0.
---
And hacked/glitch bloody guns probably trump that. I’m looking at non-glitched stuff when I make my comparison. I run bloody on main, junkies on alt. Pretty much same weapons, same perks, damage is way better with bloody. Trade off is my junkies build can take more damage.
---
That was my thought too - it looks like something that was added at the last moment. Either they couldn't get it to work as intended in time, or as you said there were glitch/dupe issues with it.
---
If they added that the crossbow has 10 arrows per mag, then I would definitely switch to that build. Something like the crossbow in State of Decay 2. They have the 1 arror per mag and 10 arrows per mag versions. Such a great and fun weapon to use.
---
Lmao at the salt
---
They're not crits, they're just "head" modifiers.
---
Yellow headshot numbers can be comparable to body damage in certain creatures, e.g. Assaultrons/Protectrons/Sentry Bots.
---
Not really. Moose was my family nickname growing up. My grandfather called me Moose because I’m fairly tall and big.
---
ok.
---
If only there was a server wide text chat or even a group text chat. It would solve so many problems and have a million uses.
---
I mean... I just got killed by stacked punji boards yesterday
---
For regular crafting that might be a tad more difficult to do. Perks like Super Duper and all could mess up if you permitted bulk crafting.
---
My take on this:
---
Building teams are largely for solo players. So go farm somewhere else, please.
---
Event teams are for doing events together. That still doesn't mean you should follow me around like a duckling when I'm *not* doing events.
---
But then I'm mostly a solo player. :-)
---
I would say that causal players and people who are playing a couple days a week probably won't complete the battle pass without paying and this is fine.  This is how it's intended to be.  If you want the cosmetics you need to put in the time. 
---
So not only do you want items from the season that we spent time earning to be available later, but you want them to be available in-game, for free, and not for atoms?  Yeahhhhh good luck with that lol.
---
Coming in to a game later can suck.  I've missed out on things before in other games because I was not in on the bandwagon earlier.  I suck it up and move on.  The people who were there doing the grinding first deserve to be rewarded for that.
---
How does the forced system affect it most of the time they are specific actions such as healing other players or killing animals, etc. Jumping achieves none of that
---
Not everybody likes or wants to use a mic. I personally can't stand earing real life voices on my video games
---
Strange in numbers is a good choice if you only have 3-5 Charisma.
---
Agreed. I run a building team. Trying to get XP. I play stealthy so I don't need someone in PA and a Gatling laser running around everywhere I go wiping everything out before I get a shot in.
---
I chased one across the map once only for me to start shooting at it and it clip straight underground never to be seen again!
---
the true question is who do we pay to fast travel, is someone with a brahim that come to pick us?
---
On that, you were right; Bloodied has too much perk synergy going on with it, yet no one at Bethesda are making good counter-meta adjustments, like perks that deal damage the higher your HP, or something like Serendipity for full HP, with higher chance of proc.
---
It comes out on game pass on the 9th
---
I'm someone who has in game voice turned off so if you ever talk at me via mic I won't hear it. I'd assume a lot of other people are the same way.
---
Exp. There are rewards that non players don't have. You don't see that until going there for the daily.
---
You could extend that far past cosmetics as well.
---
I don’t like it, but once you ride that high damage dragon, it’s hard to get off of it.
---
OP was asking if there was a way they could let their team member know they didn't want their teammate to follow them.  There is a way, they just don't want to use it.  
---
People have been asking for text chat since launch and they have never mentioned it in a roadmap or anything.  Who knows if it will ever come.  We still don't have perk loadouts and how long have they been promising that?  Over a year?  
---
Best to just use the current tools we have available to us.  You may not like using a mic but it hurts no one to turn it on to say a few words when there is a need to communicate.
---
Not all events. I fast traveled to the wolf pack event and then only then did I find out I had 41 seconds left to kill all the alphas (needless to say, I did not succeed)
---
Man i think it's really dishonest to day cosmetics aren't content, try tell that to the WoW, FFXIV, Destiny 2, souls-borne etc community. People like looking cool. Looking cool is fun. Pretend digital dress up is fun. 
---
If cosmetics aren't content then i don't see how they can have the audacity to charge for them, and if they are then they should be unlocked in game. 
---
This game wants to dip on Game purchases, MtX and a subscription model, if they're gonna this bs battle pass for player retention at least don't implement grindy crap too. Players *will* feel shit if they miss out, that's a human reaction.
---
The ocean
---
Suggestion kind of reminds of how it is on Gwent. I really would like something like that. It would remove these season's time boundaries.
---
I now want a travel Brahmin to appear, with animation of me climbing onboard *fade to black* and climb off at the destination. May take longer but...
---
Just so long as it works!!! 🙄
---
And what makes you think that you were entitled to those Atoms in the first place? This is the problems with us humans. We are at the top of the evolution because we were able to adapt to our surrounding. But we get used to it to fast. And you are the perfect example. Beth gave you the possibility to earn an amount x of ATOMS through playing the game. This was nice. They didn't had to give us this opportunity. 
---
And now they break up those ATOM earnings and scatter them in many different rewards throughout this new reward system. A system, which gives a rewards that are worth WAY WAY WAY more than the original ATOMS you could earn. But are people satisfied? No, they aren't. they begin to rage that their precious ATOM earnings, which wasn't their god given right anyway, were cut. 
---
Sorry, can't understand that mindset either.
---
I personally prefer this system by far, it gives out a good mixture of everything, and some of the cosmetics look gorgeous.
---
The leader of the pack event in the forest always spawns 3 lv10 legendary wolves as the pack leaders. It's a pretty commonly occuring event you can usually find it in a couple of server hopd or by hanging around the fairgrounds area.
---
this is the most important question. always store your junk before doing anything. ESPECIALLY if you go afk. you never know what's gonna happen while you're gone for two minutes.
---
I agree, but on the other hand it shouldn't have been included as a season reward.  If you subsequently sell it, you negate the achievement of those who ground out the (5 levels lol) to get it.  If you add it to subsequent season rewards, it becomes a useless step for those who have it.  Seems a catch 22.
---
I don't have voice on but I can see if other people are in game chat speaking.  This way, if I want to, I can turn the volume on and hear what they are saying.
---
I'd assume a lot of other people are the same way.
---
yTo be honest, do a mine run for the Lead, farm steel somewhere too. Best way to get a big load of 2mm.
---
I'm like eagerly awaiting a response from OP on this lol.
---
I'm so sorry, but i do not have to work anymore. I retired at age 30 and will spend rest of my spending while you sweat at work.
---
Yeah I see that too, can't be bothered. 
---
More times then not they are not talking to me or their mic is picking up background noise like their music.
---
Likewise: do I need to continue to load up with my stealth/sneak-related perks if I run the Chinese stealth uniform?
---
When the new season was revealed, people upset about the loss of atoms were responded to with cries of, "look how much better this is for the casual player, they just have to play to get rewards," and "you get less atoms but the season has a huge range of rewards instead."
---
Now that it has become apparent just how much time and grinding people have to put in to get all the rewards, the goal post has shifted to, as you've stated, "well who says you have to get everything, that's entitled."
---
So we are getting less overall now unless we want to put money into the game (atoms to advance our standing). How is it shocking that people are losing interest?
---
For the recipes that require sugar bombs, sometimes it seems that only the dirty ones will work, while a clean undamaged box won't count as an actual ingredient. Not sure if it's a bug or a design oversight, but that's Bethesda for you.
---
You need the sugar bombs with rads instead of without.  This has been a thing longggg before update 20.  Unsure if it's intended or a bug but it's been around forever.
---
I see your point JustALizardDude and agree tjat perhaps cosmetics and items are content.
---
In Mmos though people expect to have to grind or pay mtx for this stuff so all the whining here abiut having to do the same is a bit weird considering fo76 is a.pseudo mmo.
---
They're cosmetic rewards.  Please dont try to make it sound like you will be at some disadvantage not getting some or all of them.
---
Yep - I preferred the old style of FT where if the were no enemies around it just worked.
---
And if there were enemies  - you could easily work around that. They should just revert it cos it's pretty sh\*t now.
---
You can make serums with it.. Maybe you should hold onto it.
---
That sounds like a bug. Completing the ally quests should definitely give either Kindred Spirit or Lover's Embrace when that ally is active.
---
As a workaround, see what happens with Raider Punk or Settler Forager in your camp. Both have reliably given me Kindred Spirit in the past.
---
If it was just the „rewards“ we’re talking about, I would even agree. But you’re not paying every month to get armor paints. You’re paying for everything else. 
---
- Unlimited material storage.
---
-An extra „camp“ that acts as a free fast travel spot, storage unit, bed, cooking station, instrument
---
-Private worlds.
---
Don’t event try to tell me otherwise.
---
If every „normal“ player had access to at least the scrapbox (which honestly should be the case due to the sheer impact it has on the primary gameplay loop), I would argue the extra items would be warranted to be timed exclusives, to give continuous FO1st subscribers more value.
---
As it is, it’s just an extra layer of money grabbing tactics, because you DEFINITELY get your value already with the scrapbox alone.
---
If I do the bounties at all the planets daily for a bit, I can get Destiny 2 seasons to level 100 with 80+ days remaining. Use a ghost shell with the perk that increases xp gain and that goes even faster. Run around opening chests while doing bounties, use patrols related to those bounties, and complete as many bounties as you can in strikes, lost sectors, and public events, and that also makes ranking up go faster. Destiny 2 provides plenty of days to get to 100 even if you only play for an hour or two a day.
---
Whereas I've been running around on 76 for hours and hours, just unlocked my first set of atoms, and at the rate I'm going, I will be amazed if I manage to even get to the fireplace door by the end of the season. Especially with all the score I've earned that didn't end up getting added to my progress.
---
Mine works.  I can redeploy allies and continue to get the buff.
---
Raw flux or you've stabilized it?
---
Not positive but I heard someone say that if you should be able to buy the last 9 or 10 ranks with the free atoms you get while playing.
---
no its not
---
I’ll give it a go today and report back, thanks!
---
Oh, this is great news! I've had a PC game pass for a while now and have had my eye on F76 too (which is why I joined this sub a while back), so I'm looking forward to finally giving it a go!
---
So would I have to make a new account?
---
Yeah on my other characters I don’t have this problem. Trying to figure out what I may have done differently or wrong and put it right.
---
I think it's cause the "grinding" there comes from shit like raid completions and pvp and that. I'd LIKE it to be anyway, I'm well in the camp charging for this isn't cool lol. Ff is my fave mmo and even they've got a frigging cash shop for costumes -.- at least there's shitloads in game to earn. 
---
And your point at the end too, i think plays into it, it's a pseudo mmo, so there's no...right or wrong way to do it, but i think they know what players would like more. I'm not saying don't sell any skins at all, I'd like that but it's an uphill battle lol. 
---
Just make more earnable in game, let players earn hella atoms again, tone it back on score required whatever. I'm just really really weary of battle passes and all the cool shit either comes from that or buying it and it's like these developers want us to play their games without actually playing them?
---
My fast travel was failing 50% of the time.  Removing the Healing Factor mutation fixed it, or at least now I have a 80%+ success rate as long as I'm not in danger.
---
Same thing happened to me except instead of traps it was full of balloons and confetti. Had a good laugh and continued on my day
---
It’s all raw because there’s not a chance I’ll ever be able to get hold of all the stuff needed to stabilise it
---
I agree with you, this is depressing. I'm at score level 14 (still need to do today's dailies), and based on this it already seems impossible to reach. I missed the first days dailies and have not been doing nw. 
---
Requiring people to play literally every day just seems like more of the grind mindset added with wastelanders.
---
Even if it’s not stabilised though?
---
Yeah, assuming 150 atoms per level and there's 1500 up for grabs during the run, that should work.
---
Also I have 1st (Yeah I know, *boo* *hiss*) so that will be more if I decide to use them for that. That will depend on life, commitments etc.
---
This is assuming you don't get bit by the auto-complete bug and lose out on points. Ten caps says they won't have that fixed by time the double points weekend rolls around and oh boy is this sub going to be filled with posts about it right around reset time. There needs to be a stickied post warning people to not be playing at reset time to avoid the bug.
---
You’re fine. If you hit today’s and some XP you’ll be at 17 or 18. Those two ranks will still put you on pace for at least rank 98. I’d bet that by the end, with double XP and double SCORE weekends you’ll make it up.
---
fyi whoopsies are from diseased mirelurk spawns, it's a tough one to get without setting out to get it.
---
I was in an event and on a public team with a guy who got such an attitude about me killing the mole miners. These weren't even legendary so I was picking them off to defend the digging machine. Anyway, I don't mean to one shot things sometimes but in this case, I just wanted to help in the success of the event.
---
Jesus Christ did he have an attitude about it. There wasn't a need for him to get so pissy. So I simply left the team and stopped shooting things. 
---
Mole miners swarmed and killed him. He got mad about that too
---
Oh so just leave it in your stash until it spoils. It turns into inert flux and you can drink it like purified water.
---
Thanks for the inspiration bud. I was about to have a meltdown and purchase Satisfactory out of spite.
---
I'll keep grinding.
---
Well that's gonna make them a lot more difficult to make lol guess I'll stick with the soup
---
Sell it to vendor. You can fetch a good price. Flux is easy to get for people that need it

Yes flamers are heavy weapons.  Be forewarned though, do not replace the nozel no matter how tempting that additional damage looks or you will ruin the flamer.  The original nozzle has the best spray, the other two are bugged and you wont hit the broad side of a barn with them.
---
Nah if not stabilized, throw it in the river.
---
I love how people have all just agreed that it’s impossible that the amounts are going to change. Like, y’all think that no matter what, every weekly list is going to be the same.
---
Couldn't trade regular ammo for ultracite ammo so useless.  Interface sucks.  I still offer all regular popular ammo for 1 cap each in vending and drop the rest in front of vending.
---
None of these dudes are in existence yet due to timeline booty-ish
---
Basically yes. Just make sure you stash your junk before you go take one and you’re good. The worst thing that happens is you get killed, lose a few caps and move on.
---
Well as someone who got a full set of strangler heart back when it was only obtainable from the vault raid i feel pretty robbed, I was okay that it was purchasable with gold and didn't mind that but the fact that the T65 was statistically better however slight just bothered me, And then it hit me: as someone who's played 4000+ hours of warframe (i know kill me.) I feel like PA is going to suffer chasing a grind for a very minor power creep over the next couple of years of 76's lifetime, And while excavator is the weakest its still very tanky even without emergency protocols, my thoughts are since even the weakest PA (Excavator) is pretty tanky, I would propose when bethesda gets around to their rebalance pass that they rework all the armors defense values around the idea that every PA gets a set bonus and depending on the strength of said bonus also effects the defense, this is just a rough hypothetical so none of these values have been given too much thought compared to the effects themselves.  
---
#All PA gets a flat +75 Poison/Fire resistance (Feel free to see my post linked on poison values here as to why i think this needs to be on all PA as PA has 0 fire/poison res): https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/g4ak5c/rough_poison_resist_testing_results/
---
#Excavator: Fine as it is as its a perfect example of what i wish PA was. 
---
#Raiders being chaotic by nature in FO: Chem duration increased by 30%, Enemies explode on death, as well as explosives having 60% more blast radius (including the explode on death effect which can chain react and do minimal damage to a player if not any) 
---
#T45 being one of the PA sets that gets behind in endgame is typically one of the noobs first PA: Vats related actions in PA do not drain fusion cores at all + while out of combat regen 2HP/s up to 40% health
---
#T51 Known for being the tankiest armor retains the highest defensive stats but gets a minor all purpose buff: 15% faster reload speed on all weapon classes 
---
#T60 with the brotherhood being all about preserving technology: 50% less fusion core drain rate cannot stack with power user but also affects gatling lasers ammo count similar to the perk.
---
#Ultracite being made to comabt scorched: IE 15% dmg reduction vs scorched +10% dmg to scorched
---
#X01 being based around the high tech enclave: Killing an enemy with energy weapons has a 70% chance of making that enemy explode similar to new vegas' meltdown, crits cause enemy to explode even while alive for 30% of the weapons final damage value
---
#Strangler Heart i've themed around plague walker mutation: Restore its AoE damage back to what it originally was &amp; make enemies on death spawn poison clouds that do 30-40 poison damage and can stack with other nearby clouds low damage i know but most enemies do not have poison resist if i'm not mistaken
---
#T65 PA of the SECRET service WAS going to get a simple: Can move and stay cloaked with stealthboy mod without draining AP effect but i realized that would force using a mod slot and trump player choice so i reworked it: T65 set statisically is weightless and has the ability of cloaking the player for 3s per hit regardless of weapon type stacking up to 25s.
---
Anyway i would just like to end my post with: I didn't think too much about these they are just spitballed hypothetical ideas to contribute to the post as a "what if" just to give bethesda and others who may make posts about this style of rebalance an idea of things that could be tweaked due to how hilariously bad PA is compared to legendary armor.
---
Is there a manual solution? I I think this bug is affecting my ability to get score points...
---
ive read this more than once, could someone explain me what you mean by "failing"? played like 200 hours now, fast travel a lot and it always worked fine. just had to learn you cant fast travel out of your bed but thats not what you mean, right?
---
It depends. I f PVP means "killing everyone as if they were insects", then the Tesla is for you. 
---
But you should know manners maketh men. You can't be a gentleman fighter if your "tactics" are made of an autoaiming weapon and invisibility drugs. 
---
If you want to have a gunfight (much more entertaining) Junkie commando is good. 
---
I would love to have a "westerns only" with revolvers and lever rifles, just to make it enjoyable.
---
Me too, I'm one rank away. I'd prefer the one with planets but they know that already and that's why it's further down the game board. I'll never use the PA and ghillie suit skins and the currencies can all be had while playing. These rewards don't make it worth the grind.
---
You can use the same Bethesda account, your characters just won't transfer over.
---
Yeah, I got rid of it for now.  Added other stuff I usually can't upgrade.
---
You would use the same BethesdaNet account, but character progress, atoms, 1st membership, atom shop purchases, etc. doesn't transfer. So you'll be starting over
---
Tfw I'm level 2
---
Actually, per lore, it's the rads that make the recipe possible.
---
Its the SCORE not the awards...
---
the screaming eagle should also be able to be applied to the Combat rifle/fixer since it has its own custom model
---
Would’ve been nice if I was able to transfer my account over but oh well
---
I feel your pain friend.  Sometimes the cargobot just goes flying away or hovers at an unreachable altitude.  I've chased them all over the map before, never having them come within range or watching them warp away.
---
Make sure to not scrap them when repairing your laser rifle
---
When you’re lvl 25 go to Garrahan mining HQ and get the excavator power armour then go to lucky hole mine and ‘harvest’ the lead there while wearing the excavator pa as it increases the amount you mine by 4x. And if you need acid go to the top left of the map where hemlock holes is - there’s a workshop there where you can get acid (from memory it should be roughly 30 acid every ten minutes), hope this helps - if you’re confused just google lucky hole mine lead/farm and you should find help
---

I sell em for 1 and 1.5k

best of luck

So should I be given an explosive plasma rifle since I started the gane after they were do longer obtainable?
---
glad it was something microsoft
---
Film it, prove it, get free karma, your statement is contrarian and is backed only by your word, while a point that it doesn't has proof.
---
I'll miss the score for xp, but I do like the prospect of getting to do more public events.  I've been ignoring them for the XP.  Either way, I should be able to finish the season.  I'm growing weary of westek/golf club/DMV anyway.
---
oh add me sonofarobot i’ll be glad to team with you
---
Converted 5 perk points of adrenaline to 3 perk points in gun fu and 2 perk points in food/ drink reduction perk. 
---
Gun fu isn’t the greatest but i fills the void of adrenaline for now.
---
No damn way I'm sacrificing hours each day of my vacation to just grind this mess. The rewards are not worth it. Even if it did it still would feel like labor, it's disgusting. They should award people willing to put in a little extra of their day and make the grind 1/3rd at least of what it is looks like atm.
---
Most of us don't have time for this, are they insane? Only explanation for this is that it clearly was aimed at money spenders to get the full experience, which is a waste of work for extra content apparently introduced for the community.
---
Instead of making more ways for people to access what they game has to offer, they always add stuff that's strictly time locked. No reward for putting in extra time of your day, nothing... What a spit in the face this feels like...
---
I just got to work but if you need me to when I get off I would be happy to craft you decent hunk of ammo when I get off work. If not look up farming methods even though you might have to server hop to find materials cause a lot of people server do said farming methods too
---
Also see challenges on screen like quests instead of going to the map constantly!
---
Private server is great, probably worth the cost by itself. 
---
I have to disagree with you on inventory management. Even once you “get the hang” of it, having 100-150lbs just there so you can build/repair/craft is a hassle, for me anyway. Freeing up that space and never having to go grind for materials again has been amazing. I snatch up everything, scrap it, and forget about it. I’ve never run out since then.
---
I absolutely agree I just feel like all the people complaining are just used to having everything just handed to them with no effort.  I feel like the system works to me, the people that put in the effort get rewarded like pretty much every aspect of life 
---
 People complaining "but it's not fair"
---
Me "since when is life fair"
---
Why exactly is the casual player getting less overall now? Do you have special information the rest of the world is lacking? The casual player now gets buttloads of rewards for just playing, where they got nothing before the SCORE system. I really can't understand you. Maybe you mix up the definition of a casual player (pro tip, it is not someone who is on SCORE level 14 without the challenges for today ...), but the overall amount of reward for the average player is soooooo much higher with the new system. And AGAIN, why do you people think you have to finish this? Is there some really special, gamebreaking thing at stage 100 that stages 1-99 are worthless?
---
So you come here and complain about it? Do you think this helps? Cause I'm going to be honest, I didn't know I could afk and get treasury notes passively so thank you.
---
I had forgotten how hard ammo is to get at low levels.  I am above 350 and every weapon is primed.  I throw away thousands of rounds that I just simply don't need.  Gonna put all my ammo in a vendor for 0 caps starting today.  I challenge all of you higher levels to do the same.
---
Build up a nice store of scrap, toss it in, then unsubscribe. You can still pull from the box, just can’t add to it. Freeing that space up is amazing.
---
There's griefing
---
Then there's   S I M P S
---
When I open map and select travel location click the confirm or OK button the game drops back silently into the game with the map closed, has to be repeated 3+ times before the FT activates. On my PC this is the norm.
---
The other one is the game drops me back into the game map closed with that notification  card and chirrup sound of failing *Cool Off timer*, the card pops out briefly from the right and closes, this requires me to run about and retry, presumably the game thinks I'm in a caution state but doesn't proc the the timer, just closes.
---
This for me all started when in their wisdom Bethesda introduced the Coll Off times in a long ago patch.
---
Never been fixed since.
---
When I'm running a silo at the stage of having launched, I can never Fast Travel out of the silo but have to run the *To The Surface* tunnel and use the secret porta loo.
---
Oh shit, I didn’t know that thank you! 
---
I’ve played for a while now but only played it like a regular fall out game rather than getting involved with blast zones and the whole legendary weapons part so it’s all a learning curve at the moment hahaha, I’m also really stuck on what kind of build to go for and what I need for it if you have any advice on that too!
---
Okie doke I’ll do that, thank you!!
---
This isn't content, its monetization. They don't want most people to get it for free.
---
The issue is it assumes everyone will be able to make use of all of that time and that they have an unyielding bloodied build who can go hunt supers all weekend.
---
Lvl 200+: Hey kids, gave you ever been to the Cranberry Bog?
---
Lvl 2+: No

Lvl 200+: *Would you like to?*

BS-You wouldn't be complaining about a measly $100 if that were the case. Dream on!

[Hmmmm.....](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Tin_foil_hat)
---
Even at level 212 they are still a pain in the ass. Shooting you in the face with their face.
---
Straight up! I just recently went bloodied. I was pretty regular up until a couple weeks ago and said fuck why not. I was already fine with just rifleman perks nothing extra, but now I’m bloodied with some uny armor and I feel like god. I really hope they do some balancing with the builds and the enemies because, at least right now idk how it was before but, being bloodied is absolutely unfair to say the least lmao nothing stands a chance it’s comical.
---
But every month I get a BONUS that is a cosmetic skin for being a "PAID" member.  If you were not subscribed that month you ARE NOT ENTITLED to that bonus.
---
 No matter how you word it you are still asking for items you are are not entitled to.
---
 It's really not that hard to understand. You didn't pay that month you don't get the bonus for that month. I seriously cannot word it any easier than that.
---
You can't win
---
Do you even know if the repeatable quest will be to earn xp again?
---
The weekly reward xp amounts will change. People saw one week of challenges and their rewards and automatically just assumed that absolutely nothing would change in the next 9 weeks. Didn’t even wait a week before deciding this new thing sucked
---
Why?  It's really easy and takes only a few minutes of effort every day for prizes.  What's not to like?
---
yes it sucks fo76 has no cross platform
---
How do people have to do MORE grinding to get theese rewards you would have to do the extact same challenges to earn said atoms before so theres literally no extra grinding in the new system they have exact same challenges you just earn score instead of atoms.  You dont need to spend money on levels the board itself earns you 1500 atoms which will buy your way from 90 to 100 so theres 10 levs that every person will get free
---
I understand those tricks, but I want and need Healing Factor for my play style, to have t
---
I'll try firing a shot again and see if that works now.
---
Switching weapons doesn't work for me, I am always switching weapons to fix the ultra slow reload bud anyway when switching between PA and standard armor.
---
Fallout 76 is the *Matryoshka 'bug' doll* of the gaming world.

Hang onto it until it spoils. It quenches thirst better than purified water I think and you also get some disease resistance.

Please assume the position. - Fisto, 2010

i join the building teams for +int which gives xp. it's kinda better for playing solo, as opposed to joining events teams and avoiding events.
---
Keep saying that to yourself :) You will eventually feel better about it.
---
It's been months now, why do they want to make their players so pissed, is it on purpose!
---
Boss: I need this done for tomorrow!
---
Fo76: nah, i gotta do my video game dailies, imah head out.
---
Says dark matter, but when you craft it it looks like the regular Captain Cosmos jet pack, not the Dark Matter version.   All sorts of buggy!
---
Wait what why I never hear this this sounds funny as fuck
---
Overpowered with no loot worth while, legit took on more than one legendary scorchbeast on my own only to be killed by a scorched mirelurk king.
---
Yeah don't be logged in during the reset. Log in at least 30 minutes after the reset.
---
This is the one thing that has stopped me from farming T-65. It has no wow factor like SH used to have. But since they nerfed that one by now allowing the effect to stack it makes it less appealing as well.
---
Some guy in a Facebook group is already done with the season
---
If we had no dailes and a longer list of weeklies it'd be easier to manage with less pressure.
---
I feel you.  I need it too, but finally gave up after years of this bug existing.
---
Forceful stock for largest amount of durability possible. If you don’t want the gun to break as fast but still do good damage, take off the splitter. The explosive attribute still suffers from losing durability when you tag something. 
---
e.g. firing once at an swarm of small creatures will kill all of them, but because the game recognizes durability loss when attacking an enemy, one shot loses the durability as if you fired at all those mobs. In the case of a legacy energy weapon, issuing a splitter will create 4 shots, each with explosive effect, where if you were to fire once into that same swarm of mobs would make your durability break 4 times as fast.
---
Use forceful stock for greatest durability to weapon and take splitter off to reduce how quickly your weapon breaks. In most cases you are overkilling enemies by a lot anyway and the splitter is unnecessary. Queen fight, exp runs as west tek maybe put splitter back on. 
---
Make sure to have gunsmith, rank 3 is a good compromise but obv if you are trying to reduce as much as possible rank 5 is where you want to be.
---
Just enjoy the game, don't try to rush things like one-shot enemies or getting the best rifle possible. Some people don't find the comfort zone untill level +100, builds are hard to understand if you're new. There's a lot to explore and learn in the game that you'd probably miss if you just center your attention in builds, weapons, damage and so. Have fun!
---
In secret so your parents don't catch you 🙈
---
It's really not as bad as people first thought - I mean, it's been less than a week &amp; I'm already at level 22 on the SCORE board. It's been easier to get the XP bonus than anticipated and it's actually gotten me to try out Nuclear Winter.
---
I mean, I'm horrible at it (just don't have the hand-eye coordination for an FPS / PvP), but I have been able to get the challenges done &amp; gotten some cool stuff too.
---
It could be substantially worse, in my opinion.
---
I personally wouldn't care. Unless say they started stealing kills and stuff if i was farming or i was looking for specific junk. Then i'd just leave.
---
They want the rewards no one wants to make it a thing
---
Oooh that's kinda cringe.
---
Lol stop it the S.C.O.R.E system isn’t bad, it’s just the time gating on how fast  you can rank up. Just like the GB system it’s a great addition, the devs should just add more ways to earn in both systems.10k to 100 Xp ~Score ratio isn’t a good repeatable daily standing alone, other ways to gain should have been implemented.Treasury notes shouldn’t even exist we should earn GB straight and each event should give out between 3-5-10 Gb depending on difficulty. Imo
---
No, the point of this update is to Bethesda to earn more money from the atom store. Before the score update, everyone would get their favorite atom shop packs for free and they dislike that. This update is focused in depleting peoples atoms.
---
Don't do that, drink it when it becomes inert, it's better than purified water, do you can sell all the water to bots and get some nice caps
---
Gave up playing or worrying about the bug? 😢
---
1: Daily Challenges are autocompleting
---
2: It isn’t really new content, only replaces previous content that was fine
---
3: Rewards are pretty much ‘shit’ IMO
---
4: If you miss a day, good luck trying to reach lvl 100 in S.C.O.R.E. 
---
5: Continues to allow Bethesda to implement forced ‘grind’ mechanics or pay to unlock like a Free Mobile game
---
That's how most rich people stay rich, avoiding unnecessary spending. It's not a surprise.
---
Try equip the perk that allows you to build PA mods. Forget its name, but maybe that is the problem.
---
Upvoted for me not knowing about disease resistance from inert flux.
---
Do you have the plan for the xo1 jetpack?
---
You're not kidding about the low challenge of this game. I just recently switched from rifleman to commando and holy crap I just melt through enemies. I only use an automatic fixer and automatic handmade. VATS headshots burn down lvl 68 mutants in just a few shots. If the ever add in true 4 and 5 star weapons, I bet they'll increase the difficulty. It's easy peesy right now with 90% of the mobs. I no longer fear mirelurk kings but a mass amount of high lvl mobs can still give me trouble. Sneaky headshots are the way to go.
---
I have never had voice chat enabled and don't use a mic.
---
Silence is golden.
---
lol no. Gave up on Healing Factor.
---
Yeah. The best I found is tracking them and at least then they trigger an onscreen update as they progress.
---
I wish for this each time I look for it after starting the game up.
---
OK lol, understand, maybe I'll try running without it again, I do love not having to bother with stims, I just sell them.
---
Wait. Adrenaline is bugged?
---
Yeah. It’s not working at all.
---
Okay well keep that in mind when it takes over 2000xp to level up once when you get further into levels.
---
Maybe time to re-speck my mutations, I've collected enough for a few retries now anyway.
---
I found a nice little hill near Helvetia during Fascnacht, and have been slowly building up my camp there... Since then, I've only been prompted like once to move, and I just server hopped and was able to place the camp with no prob
---
Yeah, not for atoms. But EARNED still. 
---
I'll give an example of 2 other games I play that does something with passes to not lock people out from getting past cosmetic rewards.
---
Dauntless has a battle pass with 50 levels, After you hit level 50 every time you would earn the equivalent XP for a level it gives you a token. You accumulate these tokens and they do not expire and there is an in game store where cosmetics and emotes from the previous battle passes are on offer for these tokens. The store only shows 3 items at a time but it rotates every few days. However their pass is easy to complete even casually long before the deadline.
---
So for me as someone who joined the game only 2 months ago but the game is a few years old if there is something I want I can earn it.
---
Another game Dead by Daylight has a pass system as well it has 70 levels and gives 70 days to complete and to earn a level takes about 2 hours of play so is very tight especially for casual players to earn cosmetic rewards. Their game has a premium currency and 2 that are earned in game. One of the currencies is earned by play time.
---
Their solution is that about 6 months after the pass closes to add the cosmetics to the store in exchange for the play time currency.
---
My point is to demonstrate there are ways to let future and casual players eventually earn stuff that has passed.
---
No one needs every cosmetic but not everyone has the ability to play all the time or get everything but it doesn't have to mean cool things are locked away forever from everyone.
---
Bethesda has already designed and added the cosmetics knowing full well a lot of players will earn them and never spent atoms on them and It would feel wrong then to later ask money for them, they add enough cool stuff to the atom shop as it is.
---
We have several in game currencies we can earn with time in more casual ways maybe Bethesda can add an in game NPC run season shop that rotates a few old cosmetics at a time but only after the season has been gone a while.
---
And to add to your content.. Just another cash grab monetization scheme to get people buy atoms.
---
Welp. RIP fighting the queen for a few weeks, but worth it if the game grows :)
---
Around twin lakes is nice. But if you have a powered vendor people will be able to see you.
---
Strange in numbers + level 3 inspirational (+15%xp) is my switch out cards when I’m not running solo
---
Strange in numbers is the best perk on the game for me
---
Well, the weeklies will also help - you'll jump a few levels per week just doing those, plus we have a double XP weekend coming up, which with teams will actually be a 4x weekend. I do 5 - 6 Encryptid per day (with as many as 12, if I'm in the mood), so that alone might jump me up several additional levels + Queen fights.
---
Then we'll have the double SCORE point weekend as well (for dailies) - I think people will be a little surprised at how far they are able to progress.
---
And 10 weeks is a long time.
---
I don’t message or get on mic. But on Queen when she won’t land because everyone is on top of buildings, I’ll throw some emotes out and try to get them to come down, then when they follow me to the ground I hit the hearts, she lands and we kill her. Happy ending 🙂
---
Make a new character and level them quickly each day? It’s what I do hell if you want make one run out kill 2 things and you’re leveled than deleted them
---
A progress bar as mentioned in the feed on basic events, I base my decision on how long the event has been active. But, up until yesterday even I think a progress bar would be misleading. I was part of three blasts(one of which was mine)  where four 700+ players were there and the queen didn't survive her first landing.
---
I have claimed the sink only which I love for my crafting, but nothing else. I'll leave it until the end then claim them all in a claiming party.
---
Every time this is posted, I say the same thing:
---
**Also, .44 and Western Revolver.**
---
Check norespawns on yt. He already did the math and it shows if you play daily you will complete 2 weeks early so you do have some freedom to miss some days
---
My number of crashes has been reduced but the stutter and lag has been vastly increased. Normally we jump servers when they have lag, now we had to lower our 'good server' standard or otherwise we would be constantly jumping. Seems like every server is laggy nowadays, even those that haven't been nuked yet.
---
I don't boo and hiss 1st members, it's not pay to win at all. You always get better perks with paying for an online game and as it should be. I never once fell for the lies two years ago when they said this game will never have a subscription. All MMOs eventually go that route when there's a free option. SWTOR and ESO are proof of it. 
---
I actually thought of subbing for one month, filling the scrap box with a bajillion pounds of scrap then unsubbing. You still get to access your scrap until it's gone.
---
I agree. I had someone call me a fuckface during queen event for standing on a tent.
---
If it not, i will be the first one to bark at bethesda and riot

much higher base damage as well, so when you get an instigating xbow you single tap non SBQ with a headshot
---
Explain to me how you got that from what I said?
---
they are worth 3 each if your Charisma is high enough.
---
1. I haven't had this happen.  It's been said multiple times just don't be online when they reset or a few minutes after they do and you will be fine.  Yes this is a bug a and should be fixed immediately but it is one of the few bugs where we hae a very easy work-around.
---
2. Actually I think it's a much improved system.  I used to never go out of my way to do the old challenges because I felt the amount of atoms I got wasn't worth it when I knew I was just going to buy atoms anyways.  This pass has actually improved the content of daily and weekly challenges for me 10-fold.
---
3. This is personal preference.  There are quite a few things on there that are nice.  Is all of it great?  No but it's super easy to get.
---
4. Since it only takes a few minutes of my time to complete the daily challenges I don't see myself missing a day.  And even if you do it'll be okay.  They are planning on having things like weekends with double daily challenges.
---
5. This isn't forced by any stretch of the imagination.  It's all cosmetic stuff for the most part.  No one needs all of it or any of it.  You even said yourself that you think most of it is crap so why are you even saying that you are forced to grind or worried that if you miss a day you won't complete?  If it's crap then it won't hurt you to not grind it or to not complete it.
---
Oh I know. I never have anything valuable anyway, so its no biggie. Just went up there and saw a behemoth lol.
---
You tested it without the napalmer mod and it work in radiation rumble? Like you shot the scavengers and they healed? I use flamers a lot and really want to know, first I've heard of a mod being the reason it doesn't work outside of bashing
---
Yeah that's what I do too but it's still annoying bc I have a goldfish brain and keep forgetting what I need to do,,
---
Not to mention the removal of daily and weekly Atoms challenges so we can buy the things we *actually* want. I have a personal theory that all the "Atomic Onslaught" items were actually whipped up for NW before they shifted gears to Seasons.
---
I'm fairly new to fo76, but I'd rather get some free loot/other useful stuff, than a bunch of atoms for useless cosmetics. There I said it
---
Ive built probably about 20 CAMPS today. on top of server hopping for a couple hours for a Mirelurk King. settled for a Deathclaw instead. Im fuckin POOPED and annoyed with all this building. Ill check this thread after a nap. I am reading these tho, so the suggestions are appreciated.
---
There are 7 sentry bots around WS
---
I thought the game's TOS required us to divorce our partners and foster out our kids, quite your job, eat our pets and move into a basement (any Mom's will do) to prostrate ourselves to the alter of Todd?
---
Only then will we get all the shiny things and Transend and bask in the glow of the Holy Mothman's light?
---
I hope your right
---
I'm currently at level 16 
---
I'll still do the challenges but I knew I wouldn't reach 100. I'm okay with tht
---
No weapons, no armor, no clothing except for the beer hat.
---
They give XP. The big sentry ones.
---
You notice barely anyone ever complains when a reward I from a very hard to fight boss? It’s because they feel it is fair. Making the season pass impossible to complete without logging in every day and grinding some more is not fair, and contrary to your claim, it’s not hard, just grindy and luck on if you can log in and dedicate the time each day.  And it’s not even a good indication of how much time you spent in the game cause you can always pay to skip the grind, which is what bethesda really wants. So it doesn’t even make a good bragging trophy for anything.
---
Yeah i find it hilarious reading this point where people lay out every little thing you gotta do to max out xp, exactly do these 20 things and youll make it but its just not how most people will play a game lol 
---
I dont mind the seasons pass but i honestly feel like they would have more success and money if they based it off call of duty format. Most people cant play insane hours every day or even play everyday at that, so make it 10 times easier but put 90% of the content behind a paywall. I honestly would rather pay 20 bucks to unlock a season pass and have it way less stressful then this, i find myself now enjoying the game less and less everyday as i feel forced to run certain areas and hit every event as i want the content.
---
Wouldn't bother me so much if there was more to do... it's the grind that kills it.  
---
We were already grinding away at the same events for faction rep/gold/scrips (and for some of us, the challenges in NW... gotta get that ghillie suit!), it just adds one more thing to the list. I've played just a couple hours daily since the start of the season (only really playing long enough to knock out the weekly/daily stuff), and I'm already bored of the repetition....
---
That's a horrible comparison.
---
First off that's a tradable item that was a part of the game and then removed however instead of deleting peoples items existing ones were allowed to remain.
---
You could go out and trade for one this game has a pretty active trading community. In a sense you can still "earn it"
---
I'm talking about cosmetics that cannot be traded and how they shouldn't be a one time chance to earn and gone forever.
---
I'm also not talking about just handing them to everyone for free.
---
Sometimes I'll load in to see who's in my spot and it's really annoying when you find no one there. I used to think it was do to the perpetual npc camp that spawns next to me but that can't be it. I'm just north up the river from Wayward and across the street from Slocum Joe's. It's a popular spot so sometimes I'll load in to see if they have anything unlocked at their camp and help myself to free waters or collectron goodies, check their vendor then server jump to get my camp down.
---
You just worded it wrong. A 15% (or what ever) chance for a mysterious SS stranger to jump in front of you and take a bullet (damage) for you.
---
&gt; I was planning on buying the last 10 levels at least anyway.
---
Now thats what Bethesda want to read in this thread.
---
Guess that explains the reason then.
---
It's not much of a board game with just one person playing...
---
Lol, I definitely thought this was a NSFW AskReddit at first glance and had to do a double take.
---
If you both play on the same platform (pc / xbox / ps4), add him as a friend. Then when you see him online among freinds, on the MAIN MENU invite him to team. When you team up - log in the world. Then you can make a public team, for example.
---
26
---
Maybe they will come up with something like those other games have in the future.
---
If it changes to kill legendaries or build camp items, would it be worse or better?
---
If you want far away from everyone, there are some good flat spots right on the hills up in the north west. Not much water around there though.
---
Exactly.  I don't know why folks are defending the current setup.  And I really should go back to Warframe.  Loved that game.
---
Rank 3 Weapon Artisan + killing the SBQ whenever you can for improved repair kits
---
Probably PS4 on a wireless connection. The absolute worst wireless network card known to man. I could literally put my router on top of it and only get like 40mb out of the usable 200. My Xbox gets like 150. Needless to say I play on PC and never ever use wireless on my gaming devices.
---
I just started playing 2 days ago and the ammo issue is real. I've been carrying 3 weapons plus a melee just to have something to fight with. I found a nice player who had dropped a bag with ammo in it that saved me so much hassle. Put guns away and now somewhat live the unencumbered life again. (Until I run out again)
---
Yes, use a Melee weapon.  I picked up a rocket sledge hammer early and didn't use  gun of any type until I hit level 70.  It allowed me to wander the Wastelands early took a lot of stress out of playing the game at such a low rank.
---
If you don’t have the xo1 jet pack plan you can’t craft it
---
Raises your max hp so you have more health. I found that out yesterday my hp needle on power armor was over my rads.
---
&gt; It's bugged until the extra lunchbox runs out and you have a few moments of x2 xp until they run out 20 seconds later. 
---
Can you confirm that each lunchbox has its own duration? To me it seemed like using another lunchbox just refreshes the buff duration. 
---
My experience: One party member used 3 lunchboxes giving me +75% XP for 1 hour, then after the duration was already down to 12 min after a server hop another random party member used a lunchbox and the buff was at +100% XP for 1 hour. I then farmed the crap out of it and the buff was at +100% XP for the full hour and did not drop down to +25% XP after the remaining 12 min.
---
It’s a grind because that’s an easier mechanic to add to the game instead of content to keep players incentivized to continue playing. What it really is is pure laziness on behalf of Bethesda
---
Here are two more for Whitespring (both cosmetic)
---
In Artisan' Corner, there is still a glow effect on the floor where the armor workbench used to sit.
---
Outside of the main entrance, on the balcony the railings on the right side (when looking from the garden) are missing a fill piece and there is a gap between the floor and the balustrade, also the pillars overhand the floor on the balcony right above the main entrance.
---
Spreading your score out across multiple boards you won't get anywhere lol
---
They should have everything you mentioned but make it repeatable .. in other words a bunch of locations some raider, some settler in which players of said alignments need to bring resources, build stuff, do quests for to increase the population of the place and usefulness of the place .. 
---
and make it semi difficult, creatures barrage it with attack groups, lay siege, build forward camps for assault near it etc and if we don't continue to help it falls over time etc
---
like 4 tiers .. 1 being a camp, 4 being a full settlement with new radiant quest giving npcs for additional faction rep
---
this would be a step in the right direction at least for repeatable content seeing as though they don't know how to make instanced dungeons or bosses with loot other than a couple meds and a legendary ..
---
Last time I played was Tuesday night and that was really only for an hour. Logged in today and all of my challenges were completed.
---
\#5 Yes, you can refresh timer on +100% XP bonus with another lunchbox.
---
I hope so, they have enough monetization as it is in the game and enough repetitive grind it would be nice if they took a generous approach that is attainable for players of all skill and dedication levels when it comes to seasons.
---
On top of the cliffs directly SE of the WV Lumber Co. close to the north end of that ridge on the map there is a small cluster of pine trees.. probably just below that. At the top of that cliff, there is a sunken area with some water, a safe, and a skeleton in it. I had 7 Industrial Water Purifiers in that bit if water, and my camp up on the cliff edge with an amazing view. Very low level spawns come from the east, but the occasional Mole Rat will spawn and make you have to put a turret on the north side if your camp. An amazing spot, tbh. Also helps a lot of low level characters as a fast-travel/refresh spot when doing the questline from The Wayward!
---
The only reason I moved was because i needed more traffic for my vending machines. I also made my camp face south for the view, but the fast-travel point was to the north side of my camp and it wouldve been a lot of work moving all of the conduits and wires etc to change the entrance. So keep that in mind!
---
If you need help finding it I can upload a few screenshots, but my old spot sounds perfect for you!
---
Yikes. I guess I haven't been noticing since I've been stacking melee food.
---
I just swapped it for Action Boy for the time being.  
---
I'll swap it back once it's fixed.
---
TIL to not stand on the top of the building. Will be changing my tactics from now on. I'm just a commando without magic weapons that melt so I'm better off controlling the mobs so the heavy hitters can bring her down. Plus I want those Pleasant Valley tickets more than anything else. I need a fancy shotgun to match my fancy revolver on my wall.
---
Pleased to see I'm ahead of the curve on this one - Score rank 29 as of last night and fully expect to hit 31 tonight. The XP repeatable is the key here (as well as clearing the challenges) - earned many additional ranks simply by playing the game. Based on progress expect to complete the board at least a week ahead of schedule without spending an atom point!
---
South of savage divide
---
Yeah...I have better things to do.
---
Seriously though, thank you for running the numbers, just saved me a pile of time thinking there was a chance of getting something good.
---
Another bug for the list. 
---
It should raise your max hp, without raising actual hp above rad level which would make the percentage lower and increase damage. 
---
Unless it's designed this way to stop bloodied being even more OP.
---
Very true.... Makes me wonder how many will quit playing the game bc of it
---
Nope, it doesn't, if you are behind the schedule you might be able to catch up during the double score weekend.
---
Yeah there needs to be something else outside of daily and weekly challenges for the non-hardcore players to have a remote chance of completing the track at all.
---
Well, if they aren't activating the Pylons during the IS event.. they do need to be told that.
---
yes thats a good option if you want to switch, but I want to change my Character to charisma 1, just for Strange in Numbers and enter a team whenever I enter a server. You gain so much from strange in numbers, empath, herd mentality, why should I ever play solo again.
---
same I've been dealing with seeing enemies frozen in place .. nekkid .. but if I attack or do damage to them their invisible counter part follows me around attacking but if I leave em alone they don't attack they just stand around nekkid
---
also .. if one of these npcs is in the area .. I suggest leaving if you try to load into an area where one of these broken npcs is .. you get an infinite loading screen if they're in the cell you're loading like you experienced
---
What about them?  They won’t get the Mountaineer Outfit either. Or be able to play FO76 in its original form with no human NPCs. Or have a way to get the legacy weapons without trading something equally valuable for them. 
---
Explain to me why someone coming into the game two years after it started is entitled to the same experiences and benefits as someone that has been playing since day one.
---
With the atoms I was getting from the legendary run, that's what I meant by buy. I shan't be shelling out more $ for more, I'm already a 1st subscriber, that is enough.
---
LOL me too but I never thought of it that way till now, thanks for the LOL
---
was it standing in the water? That one is a fixed spawn if you were where i think you were. You do get some super mutants and ghouls around twin lakes. 
---
Check around the very bottom of the map near the bear.
---
But Bethesda wants you to play Nuclear Winter so bad
---
Sadly this happens in every online game. The hardcore players expect everyone to have the same knowledge as them or you're just a filthy casual. Try doing raids or dungeons in FFXIV. You miss one mechanic and you're berated for not watching hours of YouTube videos on how to play the dungeon their way. At the end of the event, all that matters is you completed it.
---
"Are ya winning, son?"
---
Have you tested this? Because here has someone reported that using a fifth lunchbox cancels out the bonus XP: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hm6ndy/psa_having_more_than_four_lunchboxes_active_at_a/
---
I just ended up relying on melee.
---
Just bought a freezer, relishasts waaay longer now.
---
Please, pretty please, with sugar and cherries on top:
---
ACTIVATE THE FUCKIN' PYLONS, GODDAMMIT!
---
outside of Cryptid, be nice :)
---
Almost. There are 9 150 Atom rewards, and then the final one is 500. 
---
1850 over ten weeks.
---
29 as of last night.
---
This is only for his most devout followers.  I praise your dedication.
---
It is nice enough by itself, i think it might realy start to shine with the Planetarium Lamp within the space illuminating the walls themselfs.
---
Yeah the ghille was 14.5k but I got that by hiding during double xp hah!
---
Yes every lunchbox have its own duration. When a lunchbox runs out the timer resets on the pip boy effect but not the actual timer. Might say 45 min left of 25% bonus xp but check your bonus effects like plastic animals, finger trap or gift bag they have a timer and thats the timer left on the lunchbox xp bonus too.
---
Aye, I'm used to subs anyway as that's been the model for MMO's going back to the 90's. Subbing for a month and doing that makes sense if you don't want to keep paying. I like the other benefits though, private nukes so you can farm in peace, plus all the workshops etc, not to mention the tent, atoms etc.
---
Why ??? There is nothing in this game which needs higher DR/ER than what the current ones can give.
---
There won't be many Adrenaline builds that would benefit more from other stats than just using other AGI perks instead.
---
You earn less atoms with the new system.
---
If anyone sees this the game is buugy,pathetic and crap. The game is filled with players who will be better and a higher level then you . In events the high level and powerful players will take the kills so you can't loot them or get any xp from them. The missions and loading times are SERIOUSLY buggy and need patching IMEADIATLY and most of the time players destroy your house steal your items from your inventory and screw you over. Goodbye
---
Nope, go and check again (Hint: It's not every 10)
---
He's the source of a lot of people's not entirely accurate, or incomplete, information about this game.
---
Anyway. Not sure where you got your information from on the max of 4 Int. boost being better than the max 100% XP multiplier of an event team. But it's at best inaccurate.
---
Via easily available XP numbers at different Int. ranks, the math works out to getting around 2.8% more XP per Intelligence point. Now you, along with a lot of others, probably thought "I'd rather take 11.2% more XP across everything than only double XP for finishing events". Well, if you were getting around 11% more XP on top of your normal amount, then I might be inclined to at least hold them even... However, you aren't. Each and every enemy in the game has a base XP value and the XP that you get a % boost to, from Intelligence, is that base value.
---
In other words, if you kill something that had a base value of 100xp (with 0 int) then each point of Intelligence you have will only give you 2.8xp more.
---
In contrast; the 100% XP modifier you get from an event team, or even a legendary hunt team, is on top of the XP you get after Int. boost.
---
As a bush wookie ? Your mamma is proud of you. We are not so much.
---
You are fine, if you keep playing like that you are going to get ahead during the double score weekend.
---
For NW and particularly the revive task, if you are socially ankward as I am:
---
go into a game, spawn nearby team mates, deploy CAMP and build a high staircase, use the "come here" emote, jump from stair and let him revive you, I will assure you that most of the time the other guys are going to do the same.
---
Did this last week and completed it in less than 10 minutes.
---
Gotta love that cop squatter
---
Yes absolutely, the biggest problem with Fallout 76 is the disconnect with feeling like your choices matter, I think a good analogy is you can walk up and blow a settlers head off and his friend will be standing there like “God I hate this mist”. 
---
If they focused more time on stuff like this than putting out shitty and lets be honest really immersion breaking Atomic Shop items it would be a huge step forward, tbh I think they should allow modders to make make Atomic Shop items as I feel they will actually make content the community wants instead of some bullshit re skin of the suit outfit
---
Yes, that's sounds like a good idea, going to work on that tonight
---
Yeah, the little unmarked pond just SW of the Solomon's Pond map icon.
---
Yeah, that’s the way to get help from others; use insulting language to describe them while asking for their help.
---
Same, made a bunch before teams came out, zero have sold.
---
Make sure all of your junk is fully scrapped in your stash. Also bulk up and sell what you barely use and keep what you need like steel lead and acid for ammo.
---
YES! and in addition camps should have higher prio than fo1st tents. Tents should be removed if a camps is about to be loaded at that place.
---
Four people were on my tent yesterday and one of them obviously had aggro cause she was hovering around it.  I was a good 100 yards off trying to lure her to the middle of the field - I only to to the tent roof when the horde is bum rushing us.
---
So, I moved my tent out from under them and the queen landed immediately. It was beautiful and funny.
---
Seems like pretty much no one is enjoying the score system
---
Well, I used to activate pylons but then I would be called a r\*tard because I got killed. So fine, if I'm not strong enough to survive then I let others do the damn pylons.  
---
Then i get called a r\*tard for not taking the pylons and kill robots instead. There's no win scenario if everyone is going to be mad and agressive over everything.
---
Anyone know if tenderizer is bugged as well? Doesn’t seem to be working, unless I’m just so used to adrenaline working I never noticed tenderizer in the first place. Also, is tenderizer worth it? Seems like it is, but I’m not sure if I’ve ever noticed a difference.
---
Ive had the first part many ties. It's just something to deal with now I guess (except the one time I had a level 91 glowing Deathclaw in the nuke zone whacking me whilst invisible. That was annoying). 
---
I did fast travel to the same cell but that's the first time I've had that issue and I tend to do it a lot, mostly because of bugged events ironically. I guess I'll have to watch out for that bug too now in future, so thanks for the confirmation and letting me know. 
---
I guess it's a bit of a minigame in of itself, trying to avoid or work around all the bugs at this point eh :D
---
I found someone giving away 10k 5mm in their vendor so naturally I took it. I did the math before converting it to .45 rounds. I would have gotten a whopping 522 if I converted all 10k. Definitely not worth it. It now sits in my vendor for someone to buy.
---
These are the random encounters that people experience that no one tells you about. And it’s the stuff that keeps me coming back to play
---
tried
---
yes
---
We checked remaining time on our +100%XP bonus, and we had few minutes left, we didn't plan on testing this, but some random next to us used lunchbox and under effects we saw that the timer was refreshed. But I didn't notice if actual XP was correct or not after that.
---
I have it
---
I’ll check again. But literally two nights ago I was checking for how much Gold Bullion and Atoms were available. I’ll have to check both of those again. I came up with 1850 Atoms and 250 Gold Bullion.
---
The Anxiety is real.  I get that.
---
And then you have groups like me and my buddies. We show up to events wearing Civil War costumes and black powder rifle‘s firing in classic formation whooping and hollering the whole time.
---
If we see anyone being smug to new players we will obviously challenge them to a Gentlemans duel
---
I know fire in the air because I watched Hamilton and want to die a martyr
---
the Zetans (aliens) are not in it... yet...
---
flatwoods monster is along the crypto-alien idea, but we have the alien blaster, so it makes one wonder
---
i think it would give another good reason to see other players camps, i believe it would be a great addition
---
Holy crap that was a turn of events
---
Even better when it's a popular event and it's almost impossible to pick out the event for all the dots on it.  Only to have the fast travel fail on you.  6+ times in a fucking row.
---
I think FOMO is the least of Destiny’s problems at the moment.
---
Look for the red smoke as well.
---
Lol the top pvp build is me and my be Gatling plasma. Nothing stops me.
---
Yep. Had my first encounter from the same guy at multiple events last night when the server was three group event teams running and cycling through multiple events for a solid two hours besides SBQ ironically enough. 
---
It all started with Uranium Fever when a level 300 got on the mic 2 minutes in before any legendaries spawned and demanded everyone (there were roughly 15 people) tag every single mob and move on to the next. Every. Single. Mob.
---
He probably mentioned it 20 times and was just super aggressive in tone. No one else responded ever and I don’t blame them, it’s awful playing with demanding and rude people. 
---
They made it very clear they were not having a good day and kept going on about the same two level 30s how they’d kill mobs without caring for others across multiple events and at one point just called them “fucking r*tards” and “dumb animals.” Even the events with hordes that easily get one tapped such as Feed the People or Back on the Beat. 
---
It was obvious they were just two people playing to play the game. People need to realize not everyone is an huge min-maxer or doesn’t enjoy help/advice. Hell they probably have voice muted to just chill out while playing, I don’t blame them. People, just be nice and friendly and try not to be a dick of you want to lead people. Understand sometimes people don’t have voice on or don’t care to get coddled.
---
I feel pretty confident, I had to work extra hours this week and didn't complete some of the dailies as I didn't have time to play, buffed my xp% with cranberry relish, and grinded some of the repeatable on the weekend and now I'm 1 level ahead of schedule.
---
I'm pretty confident that I will be even more ahead after the double score weekend
---
Oh dear, very true that is really horrible 😒
---
don't worry, the free one supplied with the playstation is not good at all. makes your ears hurt after an hour.   
---
I just bought a new one and if you wear glasses an important tip: make sure the cups around your ears are big enough. Makes a huge diffence in comfort.
---
Be90 Gatling plasma. Nothing stands a chance.
---
The very very veeeeery top right of the map is a nice spot, that noone is ever at and still in the mire
---
My bad, going to edit the post
---
Well this is rough because I’m going away for a week
---
I blame Bethesda for this because they don't structure the rewards to encourage event completion. The gold standard example of their incompetence is Radiation Rumble.  A competent game designer would have made gathering irradiated ore worth at least as much as killing a ghoul. But no, the optimal gain XP strategy in the event is to stay in the center room and open fire - which guarantees the event will fail if everyone does that.
---
They're military grade combat robots. They're supposed to be really powerful...  but if you use troubleshooters armor it makes them way more manageable. Also I know at lower levels this may be tough.. but if you can sneak attack and take them out before they spot you they go down pretty easily.
---
If weapons degrade 500% faster, I'll only be able to fire my damn shotgun four times before it breaks.
---
wait isn’t there an option for this already? or i mean with the tadpole challenges you can track at least? if i remember correctly idk
---
Agreed.
---
I am too casual to even worry about completing it, I just want more lunchboxes.   Am I the only one that loves the confetti splat on each kill?  Lol
---
Nothing happens to it. It stays there available for you to withdraw.
---
It all stays in the box, you can still use it but can't add any more :)
---
It should be the tankiest, or have some unique mods, or something to set it apart. The diminishing returns make it feel no better than T-51.
---
Or in the immortal words of stupid, sexy Flanders: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlREUROGwpI
---
I personally would suggest it if you have a ton of scrap filling your stash, or mule items to an alt.  
---
However I can no longer in good conscience recommend spending real money on a product they have no interest in fixing.  I bought the year subscription for my wife, and myself with the hope the influx of cash would help fund the game, and as such make it better.  While some things have a lot more hasnt.
---
Yeah, this. I don't think it's bad. I got a few decent plans and some caps, so I'm already happy
---
Yup, as the other guy told you, you are fine, don't panic and start buying atoms to skip levels yet. 
---
You are probably going to catch up during double score weekend, save your free atoms for the end of the race just in case you get behind schedule.
---
Exactly! I just moved and I haven’t been able to play for the past 5 days. I was only able to make it rank 3 it feels like I’m so far behind.
---
A beautiful thing indeed, I must remember not to place my tent until after the event.
---
It goes both ways. Plenty of times I try to be helpful and tell people how to do certain things nicely.  Response is always STFU ill play how I want.
---
Thank you for the info
---
I will but when you use the drop req it's supposed to show a little circle where you got search on the map
---
Aye. good for testing weapons on
---
Is anyone else not getting S.C.O.R.E. from some challenges? Like the one where you have to destroy robots, and you can pick exactly which ones, but after you finish the challenge, you get nothing?
---
I even tried finishing the entire list, but it didn't work.
---
np
---
By "others" you mean you lol ? 
---
It's an online video game, people talk shit. But then again, i was hardened by MW2 lobbies back in the day. A boy became a man after months of playing MW2.
---
thanks for tge acurate explanation, appreciate it. im on xbox and have definitly never had issues like that. and i fully understand now, why people complain about that, sounds annoying af...thank you!
---
This is my issue, but it sort of depends on how they use the atom shop going forward. Are most new items going to be from SCORE or purchase in the atom shop? If the former, then it’s less of an issue. If there are still as many new atom shop items without the ability to earn daily atoms, then it’s a problem.
---
They don't *know* if they've fixed bugs or not, and they constantly add and remove both old and new bugs.
---
If the CM is reading this, [here's something you can pass onto the developers](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control).
---
Never had my house destroyed or anything stolen from my inventory. Aside from those two points I do agree that most high level players just kill everything too fast sometimes. And the menus can be laggy as hell on a full server
---
There are all these skins you get through NW but I can’t see the challenges to get them lol
---
Oh god.... did you call the police?
---
welp, im already 7 levels off for today.
---
I really wanted that power armor too.  sigh.
---
Ah, cheears mate. Just making sure i dont get slapped up as always by bethesda 👍
---
Check your quests in your pipboy and look for one related to collecting a supply drop. Sometimes the quests get put as inactive so you have to go in your pipboy to mark them as active.
---
I really agree with this.
---
Thus is why I use psychotats instead.
---
The point would be that you could look at the daily/weekly challenges, which are the same for every player and character every day and every week, before you log into a character. So, for example, if one of the dailies is "Level Up," you can choose the appropriate character to log into to complete the challenge effectively. This would prevent you having to log in and out of multiple characters to identify the challenges and then get to the right character to complete them.
---
They removed the ability for it to stack, so that isn’t the case anymore.
---
why are you being downvoted? have an upvote
---
FYI Herbivore doubles the XP bonus from Cranberry Relish, with Strange in Numbers that's 25%. Event teams do not boost the XP reward for quests, but Build teams do because of the extra Int. I'm at level 21, haven't done a single NW daily and did not grind XP during the week at all, just these last two days, and there's still today's dailies before the next week. Then there's lunchboxes that if stacked can get you double XP and the double xp week, plus double score week. You can get a 345% XP bonus with Double XP + Lunchboxes + Cranberry Relish or Tasty Squirrel Stew + Herbivore or Carnivore + Inspirational + Rested. With those bonus, evem if you have 1 Int, a single run of glitched Line in the Sand (where enemies spawn ontop of the Sonic Generator) will almost get you an entire rank, and a run of West Tek will get you close to half a rank.
---
Well, they should be able to get to level 5 pretty quick, so probably not a bad thing to craft. set of level 5 armor for them to use - maybe a couple of weapons too (anything that uses .38, since it will probably be the most plentiful ammo they get at the beginning).
---
I'm pretty sure this answer is not going to like anyone, but contact Bethesda support, last time I had that bug with the NW bug I contacted them and they gave me the atoms.
---
If people keep pointing out that issue they for sure are going to compensate players that suffer the bug, like they have done in the past, just be sure to submit a ticket to have some sort of "proof" that you have a problem.
---
Also god mod still present.
---
You pretty much hit level 5 doing the first bunch of quests. Gear mostly isn't worth worrying about until higher level as 1-50 doesn't take a huge amount of time.
---
If you are having trouble in NW with aiming. Try playing in 3rd person. You have better view of your surroundings and it is easier to get a bead on your enemy once you get used to the new perspective.
---
I gave Beth my time and money to buy this damn broken thing and they expect me to pay for that worthless stuff that is not even a microtransction, that is my problem.
---
Set it to one in case you faintly hear a useful mic chatter.
---
I am proud of it but i'll probably never use it because i have this bad boy.
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/lyJF5tG](https://imgur.com/a/lyJF5tG)
---
Yuuppp. A single westek run and youll be good for steel and plastic for a while. They also drop gunpowder aannnddd that locations also (usually) has quite a few legendaries in it as well.
---
A couple of my friends and i started to play together. I was level 55 and they just started.
---
Usually i gave em leather armor and some pipe guns (.38)depending on what they prefered
---
17 as of this morning I think, done all the daily and weekly challenges minus the NW stuff.
---
Yea I no but there no extra grinding there still the same challenges you just get score instead people keep complaining about how much you have to grind to get rewards you would have had to do the extact same grind for atoms in the old system literally the only difference from old system to the new system is we lost our choice of what rewards we get ( which I no kinda sux but it's not as big a deal imo)
---
Only heard a mic person like 4 times max with default mic volume but im on ps4 so
---
For the Gauss Minigun? I would like that too.
---
Helmet is the last thing I will buy if even.
---
Got a bloodied and an instigating shotgun in the stash, they can't beat my anti armour one. You on pc?
---
Ah ok thanks, I'll do that in a bit. Because I know the drop event doesn't happen until you get close I think. From what I saw you have to be close by and then the drones will spawn in and drop them off
---
There's a fancy revolver? Time to cash in some more tickets and sell off more western outfits.
---
Bethesda is probably going to extend the run one week (as there is not an official date for season 2, it only says mid-september) or make another way to us to get more score, probably during those BoS events.
---
No, I am sorry, but the fact that you need to do EVERY Daily/Weekly EVERY Day/Week **plus** do the repeatable 16 times per week to **just barely** finish is fucking bullshit. There should at LEAST be enough room to miss at least like 5 days and still be able to complete it, they cannot reasonably expect people to play every single goddamn day.
---
You're misunderstanding my post. I'm 310th level.  I'm thinking on what's the best armor I can craft for a character fresh out of the vault so they can just not worry about it until around level 30 or so.
---
F
---
Yeah for the gauss style weapons that would be great :)
---
And I disagree - every paying member should get the bonuses up until that point. 
---
For future bonuses you would need to pay for an additional month. Or wait a few months and then pay again. 
---
Every paying member would still get their bonuses, with the exception of the people who decided to skip a month or two having to go without current bonuses and the other amenities. 
---
Fucken hell, you’re acting like I want to take something away from you smh...
---
Yea its 1500 atoms total so if everyone saves there atoms till the end everyone that gets 2 90 can buy the last 10 levs just off what the board awards you
---
This would be an awesome in game event as well. Pricketts Fort, Mr Gutsys in formation and the player has to re-enact the battle but it’s clearly botched and full of Blamco ads like the cemetery stories. 
---
All that aside I’d love to see your unit in game.
---
If you didnt have any junk on you then you could have probably took a legendary item from one if them and got away. Even if you died you would still have the kegendary item
---
Not arguing with you about the fact that they are making us play every day. But you can complete almost all dailies on less than 30 minutes, weeklies are easy to do too.
---
I don't play on public teams. What happens if you block a team member/leader during an event?
---
Or mute that one player?
---
Hmm.. Chamber the hunting rifle to use hardened .38. Never thought of that - always left it at .308.
---
You are not that behind, you are going to catch up and get ahead during the double score weekend, I believe in you
---
Im at 14 I think. Missed 1 maybe 2 dailies.   
---
But I’m not chasing the 100 score.  I log in script and sell out what I need and I’m done.  
---
Might do and event here and there depending on what it is.
---
haven't encountered anyone like that on pc EU, in fact everyone i've come across have been super crazy helpful and nice, they gave me so much stuff it's amazing. don't think i've come across an online community like this in any game.
---
0
---
Someone claimed they provided a clarification to that effect, but I haven’t seen it myself.
---
Teams is something this game needed bad. Its supposed to be like an mmo but it was a lonely game before patch 20
---
Thats not how seasons work lil
---
Players can't destroy your house or steal items from your inventory, you brain dead fart.
---
Wait for the double score weekend before giving up, also save some atoms for the very end, is still possible to catch up even with only the repeatable quest
---
That also might be true, but I get the feeling that the score rewards would increase with the difficulty, and the difficulty will increase as the season goes on.
---
I knew I'd never get a high SCORE, but here's the crazy thing, I'm a casual player, and I've already earned more ATOMS then I normally did pre-seasons.
---
Now there's more chance to buy pointless cosmetic stuff. Whey!
---
Right, well until 10 they can only wear leather anyway. The one thing that would be definitely helpful is any torso armor with a dense mod on it.
---
Thank you! You shouldnt have to do EVERY Daily/Weekly every day/week **PLUS** the repeatable 16x per week to finish, there should be SOME cushion so its possible to finish even if you miss up to like 5 days or even more tbh.
---
\- "Only 25 per Level" still adds up until you reach level 100. In total over 220,000 Score is needed. About 10% progress is pretty accurate.
---
\- Double score weekend is only for dailies, not weeklies  
---
\- Events are not intended to give you score:
---
&gt;There's some incorrect information about that on our website. It should  state that there are challenges to "Complete Events" or "Complete Public  Events" that *do* award SCORE, but Public Events don't currently grant SCORE all by themselves. 
---

---
\- The fact that there are people with level 33+ on its own does not make it a good or well balanced mechanic. There are also people in this world who made millions of dollars starting from nothing, so it must be everyone's own decision to be poor (/sarcasm)?
---
As a commando build using a handmade/assault rifle I too share your pain. 
---
Clear a few areas of super mutants/scorched, scrap all the weapons for steel, with the scrapper perk on you get shed loads of steel very quickly. 
---
Lucky hole mine with excavator armor for lead, one run through there gives me over 1200 lead, and with ammosmith and super duper makes enough ammo to last me about a week. Subject to SBQ runs, if you run them multiple times daily expect to be in the mine every day or two getting lead.
---
well, if you want to struggle.. youve certainly got the build for that...
---
Yes I keep doing that and farming for plastic to bulk it but it’s such a pain I’m always tempted by the extra office desk fan 😆
---
That's bugged, you are getting th score point when you kill 3 of them for some reason. After you kill 5 the daily completes, but you already have your point, that why it doesn't give you anything.
---
Well essentially it’s like a rail gun so why not a huge mag that holds a thousand rounds but just a thought.
---
Im two weeks on vacation now. I won’t pay 30-40$ on the missing levels
---
They said it applies to daily challenges only. The repeatable xp quest is a weekly.
---
Thanks I do wear glasses can you recommend one?
---
Also if you're feeling generous shielded under armor has no level limit.
---
Sir!!! Sir!!!!! Hear me sir... Pear skin,  banana flesh, coconut taste- Peanananut
---
Is what it is. 
---
I’m gonna try and get there, but a toddler and full time job, makes it tougher. 
---
Glad they made it tougher to get the high end stuff, almost like the strangler heart before it got duped.
---
Oh, that's what happens. I guess I wasn't observant enough. Thank you!
---
Hopefully you don't miss the double score weekend. That way you can get ahead.
---
We lost choice indeed, and there's a time limit too. And less atoms so yea, pretty big downgrade. Bethesda just made it a little more obvious we're nothing but cash cows.
---
No he’s Captainnoob72
---
It’s the little boys that are doing the shit-talking, no matter how old they are. Real men aren’t giving people grief over the internet on a video game.
---
Awesome, will do! Would be fun to have someone to play with
---
Yes. Been saying this since release
---
It depends on what the base XP was. If you already had other XP buffs (including just more Intelligence than 1), then some bonuses were already applied. 
---
So if the base XP was 100, but you already had effects that gave you +36% (like increased intelligence; each point of Int is about +2%), then another +10% would have been +46%, or 136 up to 146. 
---
XP modifiers are additive, not multiplicative. The exception is Double XP weekends. That seems to just double whatever you would normally get from your buffs.
---
My spiked walking cane got me through some sticky situations when I was still a low level.
---
16 without even trying for Daily/Weekly or playing NW challenges.
---
Again I dont see why high levels have to carry low level weaponry, change their build loadout or even go around gun bashing. Easiest option is to sit back and let the lower levels do it but wait that's when posts like this pop up. 
---
Damned if you do. Damned if you don't.
---
Yup. There should be some type of pylons like imposter event.   Activate pylons forces SBQ to land.  Or some similar mechanic.
---
Does friendly fire work with an explosive flamer?
---
Should have thrown out some explosive bait around it.
---
What level should we be *today*? I'm on 18 but I feel like I'm behind for some reason?
---
Does inspiration work on public teams?
---
That is legendary
---
They can if they attack you and they can steal your junk if u die
---
Sorry for your loss, next time you go vendor shopping try to remember to store all your junk first. We've all been there and lost stuff somewhere. 
---
Also I'm pretty sure naming and shaming is against the subs rules, see rule 9.
---
I have mastered the art of Hakuna Matata while playing online games with other people. 😂
---
Yes please!
---
Lies , you get one from the responder quest .
---
As a long time WoW player I agree.  You want the best gear?  Grind dailies.  Want the reputation to get those items?  Grind dailies.  Want the coolest cosmetics?  You guessed it, grind.  I have never understood the entitlement I see in this game by some.  Even the season pass stuff.  Go play other games with a season pass, you only get the items if you put in the hours, it’s not without grind in any other game so why should 76 be different?  Sucks some will have it by week 3, some won’t have it at all.
---
On a less salty note the roadmap for the next 10 weeks has a double SCORE week, so that’ll be a great time to catch up :)
---
You're wrong with the weekly amount of S.C.O.R.E you get, you get 7500 per weekly complete so your system is broken to start with. Sorry
---
The rocksy glitch to get more raider reputation still works
---
You also get 500 atoms for level 100 so It's 2000 atoms total
---
No. That's the fire breathers outfit. The responders is like a .8% drop from certain events.
---
Had some similar experinces where I received the legendary combat armor from the SBQ fight (or other loot) but only got the text on the upper left, went on doing some other quests and randomly when completing those quests it would suddenly give me the fullscreen reward showcase for the combat armor I got an hour ago
---
Imagine if bethesda made world specific silo codes. That would ruin every player.
---
&gt; all the people complaining are just used to having everything just handed to them with no effort 
---
Huge difference between no effort /casual play/ and literally having to grind just about every single day just to get to complete it. I get its free and we don't have to do it but that's a bad mentality to have. If you miss a couple weeks you're screwed. It should reward you for wanting to grind not feel like a punch in the face for wanting to progress it. 
---
Also bethesda said we would be able to progress it with casual play and that's just a straight out lie. You have to grind every day if you want to finish it in time. That's assuming you can play every day. God forbid you start this late july you essentially don't have a chance to complete it without buying atoms. This thing is just heavily geared towards buying atoms. 
---
"Don't like it? Don't do it then?" 
---
"Don't like the ammo converter? Don't use it then" 
---
"Don't like the many bugs and time caps? Don't do play then"
---
I think you forget that people want the game to be successful. When we excuse this kinda shit it just gives them a reason to never improve.
---
I thought it was only a low percentage chance it dropped from that?
---
The NW crossbow is a fantastic burst weapon.
---
Ive been playing on and off since release and I've never done project paradise I tried once and qut because I was being genuinely screamed at by some   ass, he ended up following me with his team for a solid half an hour until I left the server
---
thanks! i was looking for exactly this, just some way to make sure im pacing myself through this.
---
Yes, very rare. I got one the other week and thought it was my birthday!. 
---
If you don't want it you'll get some nice stuff for it, I'm sure.
---
What console are you on that sounds really cool I’d like to see your unit
---
why? is fun  and i get free things out of it that I wanted. I hope they keep doing it and add more content with it, just normal playing I'm at lvl 16.
---
I don't really mind the season, I think it is a really cool thing, it just that the grind should not be that you have to log in every day and complete every challenge just to get it within the time limit. 
---
IMO, you should be able to earn all the rank if you complete at least 50-75% of the challenges during the season. this way it gives people some breathing room and the ability to catch up if they missed a day or week.
---
If you look [here](https://imgur.com/gallery/2vkkz8x) you can see that she does have lip liner in FO4, it’s just not as obvious. I mostly just need to work on the color to get it to be a bit more subtle.
---
Better yet, place your tent a little bit further away from the battle zone, close enough that you can run from it, but far enough that it isn't in the battle!
---
Yeah it is rare.  It drops from random events.  I got mine from the leader of the pack event and the helmet from breach and clear event
---
"would love to see your unit in game"
---
PHRASING!
---
You are correct. That person is 100% wrong
---
Don’t waste your time with this
---
Haha I do now too! Have you seen any trades involving this outfit?
---
No one disagrees. But if it happens, you can bet they just resell the same skins for the fixer as a separate gun.
---
Cool, too bad a lot of my challenges are glitched and won't complete....
---
Full set of leather I'd say with a nice shielded underarmor.
---
The game feels unplayable after you unsub because of the inventory management.
---
yeah they don’t show up for some reason. heard the inclusion of christmas and halloween skjns are bugged anyway
---
Why? In low on supplies
---
You're acting like it's really difficult to switch to a weaker weapon.  Its not.  Hell, you could even just punch the legendary.  Just out of curiosity what kind of build are you?
---
That's it, knew I was off haha
---
I look for similar locations, and the challenge is that "scenic + secluded" is easy, but adding in "+water" massively narrows down your options.
---
In my experience the best "secluded + water access" areas are all along the southern border of the map, just west of The Bog. Start by going southeast of Johnson's Acre until you hit the map border, and then west past the bear (on the map) and the first little mountain range to the west of the bear. 
---
There are a lot of water sources in that area, and while there are a few near fixed spawn locations that can be annoying, some of them are quite peaceful.
---
honestly, i wouldn’t mind spending some atoms for them if at least we get something...
---
Did you get off the tent?
---
You will get good trades for it. I would not use the trading sub you're on though. If you go into my post history you will find the good one. We can't name it here
---
I’m just putting in other agility cards like marathoner and sneak. Fun way to try something new while I wait. Doesn’t hurt my build much at all.
---
He's talking about the normal responders one which you do indeed get from the belching betty questline.
---
I missed out on the dino mount when I was like a kid never touched wow again.
---
What roadmap do you speak of? I was just looking for any info on scheduled events like double xp or score, and purveyor sales or events.
---
Does this factor in the double SCORE weekend?
---
Also best to save grind sessions for the double XP and Score weekends so you don't wear yourself out beforehand. I'm gonna grind like crazy those weekends
---
Yeah, hope all those low INT characters enjoy having to respec in order to do this at a "decent" rate. Don't forget the mandatory Unyielding set, because we weren't encouraged to become yet another Bloodied abuser already.
---
Sounds exactly like my experience but they never got off the tent or moved it. It was obvious she was aggroed to one of them in the tent. It took forever to kill her.
---
Thank for your opinion. Definitely changed my world view. I'm starting to see things differently now.
---
Make sure you make this simple change in the ini file to unlock frame rate:
---
https://www.kotaku.com.au/2018/11/fallout-76-quietly-unlocks-frame-rate-without-breaking-the-game/
---
Full unyielding secret service armor with a jetpack
---
Damn lol
---
They will turn grey on your end, you can't hear them... then nothing else, you'll still see them in servers!
---
In Destiny 2, people just pay others $400 to play for weeks so they can have all the best gear. What a grind!
---
Posts about trading aren't really allowed on here mate, but yeah.
---
Paper bags disappear by time. I always start the event by going and getting one from another location i know has one almost 100% of the time.
---
When is the double score weekend?
---
All I want, is to accidentally drop a gun using a skin, without having to worry about it getting destroyed.
---
I always carry a shovel since it's a repeatable. I've never seen one at the site and cant be bothered to go into my stash for it.
---
Yes it’s me. Big whoop
---
Oh I know, just testing the water
---
Yup. It's basically the single shot western revolver with a gold skin.
---
Yeah that is the only way they can do that, can't really think of another way but that's a solid idea.
---
I think their code is a mess and it was an accident
---
20, but halfway to 21 IIRC.
---
Shit i have that one too, how did I forget about that?
---
You the man now, dog
---
I have a Bloodied 90Wr Shovel. Best drop ever.
---
I agree with this also.
---
Yeah.
---
\&gt;  Daily quest givers are not fixed in position as stated in the patch notes. 
---
Thank you!  Nobody else had mentioned this and I was beginning to think I had imagined it.  Also, I am very dubious about this one in the patch notes:
---
 **Controls:** Fixed an issue that could prevent PC players from using the mouse to equip and unequip Perk Cards.
---
I still find myself clicking on perk cards over and over and nothing happening until I give up in frustration and move to the arrow keys.
---
agreed also cap amounts on each character would be nice considering most have multiple characters because of having to juggle around loot and caps
---
But Bethesda wants you to. People all think “man I’ve made 20 levels in a week, this’ll be easy” expect it won’t with the ever increasing 25 more xp after each level. You’re doom to not reach tier 100 and I’m sorry
---
There is another just down the hill from the cemetery.  Having said that I always BMO (bring my own)
---
Keep dailes to award you atoms and weekly awarding SCORE, pretty sure everybody would be happy about it
---
Same
---
Ok! So it doesn't destroy your team? 
---
Thats what I'd do with someone that pissed about a game. There's no reason to listen to that, we're all here to have fun.
---
It's not about the build I'm making the point of "why"...
---
If you've spent so many hours in the game to get strong why then do a U Turn to carry a lower level weapon and it's ammo. Why spend all that time only to have to nerf yourself to satiate low level entitled players that won't give thanks. Or even know that your doing it and will still think because they didn't tag something and it died off screen that they would assume the higher levels did it even though they carrying a level 5 pipe pistol. 
---
Basically everyone paid to play the game and everyone should be allowed to play exactly how they want. Most people didn't but this game to level up get stronger then weaken themselves for strangers to tag. 
---
But then if they do they get complained about for not going all out. 
---
Again Damned if you do, Damned if you don't.
---
I blocked someone and they were removed from the team and were no longer able to join my team. I don't have voice chat on so I'm not sure about that.
---
In 2 weeks
---
And it’s hilarious to watch them do that. It was like this when people were griping when they hadn’t gotten a rare mask after 20 Fasnacht runs, because it *’should have been guaranteed by that point’*
---
Preach it! I rock The Fixer like crazy, and I'm tired of the look and the inability to change it.
---
I try to bring my own. I just picked up a level 15 Zealot's shovel, probably my BWH go to now.
---
Thanks, Bethesda!
---
Yes, I mean others and myself. The attitude is towards all players present at the events.
---
I'm level 300, at this point is aggravating to hear a guy half my levels bossing me around calling me a r\*tard because I didnt feel like collecting ores at radiation rumble or if I decide to stand on top of a fence at the SBQ while I reload. 
---
Let others play however the f\*ck they want, why is it so hard?
---
That's not horrible, I'm going to wait until the last 3 days before I do that, but it's nice having that option as an extra lifeline in case the finish line is unreachable.
---
Well there is a token on the board for your opponent, but he’s already on chapter 2
---
I don't think so, otherwise that'd screw up people who accidentally mute someone when the game glitches out and the "invite to team" or "fast travel" button dissappears!
---
They're entitled to all the endless disconnects we had at launch too ;)
---
I don't mean this sarcastically, but just normally playing the game can drain your ammo fast. I'm a relatively buffed shotgun build and I'm always running out of shells. Some enemies are just bullet sponges so I have to decided whether they're worth killing fast (using my precious shells) or or slow (draining way more 10MM for example). 
---
I was playing very conservative with my ammo early on, so I'm lucky that I have a solid amount on everything but shells. I have a few melee weapons (mostly reduced weight knuckles and a vampire fire axe) that I switch to often to finish enemies after I kneecap them and make them less scary.
---
wondering if psplus is in the future as well - i would greatly like to NOT have to keep the disc in the drive all the time.
---
Username is the same as this but without the numbers. Find me and ill sort you out a one shot shotgun
---
At level 16 you’re already behind the curve required to reach lvl 100 by the end by at least 6 to 10 levels I’m sorry
---
There should be a double XP weekend next week, but we don't know yet if it's gonna be double score as well, or that's gonna be it's own separate thing.
---
This psa is pretty misleading.  It assumes people want to spend atoms to finish the run. By that logic why not just wait until the last day and buy the remaining levels as well.
---
I have the feeling of talking to a brickwall. I see the problem now. Beth underestimated the fear of missing out too much, and now people think that every single player and their mother should reach stage 100 with no effort.
---
The funny part is, you get even more rewards then before, but the point of critisism is, that you can't get ALL of the rewards. Your feeling for proportionality is really off.
---
But anyway, i'm off. No need to talk to stubborn childs that throw a tantrum for not getting everything shoved up their butt. Have fun raging ...
---
I usually just take over the steel yard and lakeside cabins. Do power up Poseidon for power and let it run. But i will definitely try this run!
---
I forgot about the light bulbs!
---
Will this game survive 10 seasons though?
---
You are fine, most of the people that complete the dailies are going to get ahead of schedule once the double score weekend comes.
---
This game is rated M. It is intended for mature audiences, supposedly people that are of the age of adults. Adults typically have to work to pay rent, mortgage, etc. I get what you are saying and I’m not saying you are wrong, but the main audience of this game is adults that have lives.
---
Definitely not, happened to me several times yesterday. 
---
1. Item
---
2. Item
---
Yeah that works too.
---
They are majestic right
---
17 here. Looks like most people are at 17 so thats good I guess
---
For my, such time gated things like season passes make me rather stop playing a game than play more.
---
I want to play at my own pace + I can only play at the weekend a bit, so I know, I'll never accomplish everything in any season, doesn't matter which game. This demoralize me in such way, that I rather don't participate in the season first place, what sooner or later always drives me into abanding the game. It was the case with destiny 2 and it will be the same with fallout 76.
---
I think seasons are a bad concept, but I think the game directors feel really smart by implanting such mechanics.
---
This is the problem I see. In elder scrolls online when you have events you can miss a few days and still get all the rewards. \\
---
I also hate the challenge that almost every day you have to gain a level. That pretty much requires making an alt since leveling up with my normal character once every day is just not reasonable to do. 
---
The other problem is all these double challenges. Complete 5/6 dailies to get points, on of them is NW and one of them is leveling up. So most of the time 4/6 are reasonable to do.
---
I know they'll give atoms out because it might push someone to buy more to get what they want. Not sure if they'll ever give out score points though, I personally haven't had a problem yet. I guess the only way to have proof is to always be recording your gameplay to provide video evidence. I'm sure by now they're aware of the bug and hopefully they're working on it.
---
There are two people playing. Look at the board again.
---
I have a Nocturnal 90WR shovel - never leaves me.
---
Hmm I've never accidentally muted someone- but I'm sure the blocked person could hop servers and find someone else to play with anyway. If they're friends they could communicate outside the game.
---
I'm remaining hopeful i can somehow use this to get my PC save and play with my Friends on Xbox, but it doesn't sound likely...
---
Not everyone can, you need to have a build to take damage and be prepared otherwise you constantly die and it's the same as nothing. 
---
 So no, that's not an excuse to boss people around. You could suggest it nicely tho.
---
This needed to be said.
---
I have a BSS one!
---
Sure i'm, mate double score weekend double XP weekend, and a tom of time to grind.
---
They are indeed, I'm so glad they fixed that one obscure one.
---
30
---
Exactly. We persevered through the tougher times. They can go without a space themed wallpaper. They’ll live.
---
Thanks agreed
---
I love stories like this, when you get to a high level you'll just kill both and move on, all jaded and bored. 
---
Enjoy the novelty mate.
---
It's not meant to be enjoyed. It's an excuse to remove the already-existing daily/weekly system because flat-out reducing the atoms given would've been too obvious for the slower folks in the crowd.
---
But don't worry, you can also spend that smaller amount on progressing the board, in case you really want to help Beth shaft you.
---
People being on buildings doesn’t seem to be the issue.  There’s usually one player drawing aggro from her.  If that player is on the ground and in an open space the queen should land.  My heavy seems to always be the focus of her attacks and she lands facing me 90% of the time that she should.
---
Thank you for bringing this to our attention! We'll get this investigated internally.
---
I'm fortunate enough to be partially deaf
---
yeah, but it doesnt hurt to fill a report just in case. We will have to wait for an official statement.
---
You’re quite the negative nelly aren’t you

I've only been reading the displeasure on this sub, but this looks like the most unfun activity imaginable.  I didn't like doing the boring dailies and weeklies the first time, forget doing all of them every day and STILL not doing enough and having to grind out 16 repeatable weeklies.  Beth just doesn't get it.
---
The main issue with this is why is there this level of grinding in fallout 76?
---
Theres literally no point. Its barely an mmo. The late game is literally just a grind for no reason. 
---
Hell I wouldn't even care about the grind if there wasnt hard caps for everything end game. Whats the point of capping scrips and gold? What's the point in the seemingly hard cap in score when we're supposed to progress from casually playing?
---
"Go play other games" thats the issue. These features are supposed to keep us coming back and they're seemingly driving people away. 
---
This isnt WoW. This barely even seems like an online multi-player sometimes.
---

---
Ward is fixed. He still goes to the music in the evening and bed at night, but the rest of the time he’s in the same spot. So based on the time of day you always know where to find him.
---
My guess is that it mutes them as well. 
---
Well if it boots them from the team I'd use it for serious grievances only. Wouldn't want people just booting each other cause they don't like the way they play.
---
Had a bunch of Junk on me, not a ton, but enough that I didn't want to lose it.
---
My Xbox Scorpio takes less then 5 seconds to load from the menu to in game. Surprised it takes people long on consoles, never had an issue
---
Respeccing is also really hard. It takes so many levels to respec a character. I would need at least 10 levels just to move my int to 15 and that would not make it a viable build. Getting 10 levels would take far too long also. I am about 160 and I get a level maybe every 3-4 days of normal playing.
---
waste of time unless you are a low level. Even then, googling for the supplies you need and just getting them is a better strategy.
---
Sounds like a reasonable strategy since the last few levels will take the most grinding
---
I also noticed this [PS4]
---
Why don't you just kill them?
---
Yes, i feel your pain. I'll keep you in my prayers.
---
Only if you attack back...
---
That is the same for all survival games. (taking your stuff when you die)
---
they are on my team
---
I just recently started using a mic because I got tired of emoting and pantomiming everything.  And still barely have it on
---
also it's always high levels...
---
You max hp increased, so your hp increased proportionally, but the amount of rads did not increase, so your hp/rads weight changes and you might lose nerd rage.
---
No one wants to go unarmed in power armor UNLESS they brought back the German Suplex from Skyrim.
---
Oh man, that sucks. AFK'ers.
---
No good. Tried both, still well rested with both of them, then tried bringing Sofia back and reigniting the Lovers Embrace (dialogue options put us back to where we were) and now even she only gives well rested. So I’m back to Beckett, maybe it will all go back to normal eventually but it’s not a huge issue either way.
---
No I’m a realist to total bullshit
---
 The worst part is most of them leave team fill on.  Starting the game down 1-2 players because you have an afkbot on your team is very annoying.
---
at the end of the day I would rather still be awarded atoms to buy what I choose than accept what they decide to give me..
---
thats my only problem with it
---
*Cries in Spear*
---
I will try it tomorrow since it's released on the game pass. I have a few friends to play with, so any good suggestions for builds to start with? Normally(Fo3, FoNV, Fo4) I always tend to make an all around/sniper build, dunno if it's viable in group since I will probably only play 2-3 friends around
---
Well that sounds hilarious! Are you accepting new members at this time?
---
Listen man, some games I go for actually killing, other games I just chill in a bush as I watch random people roam around me. Its a funchallenge to make it to top 2 by hiding in plane sight. The issue is you're more rewarded by being alive than you are for killing people. I'd be way more invested in TRYING in NW if getting a kill mean more than 20 xp. I like the game mode, it has promise but it sucks that you get no credit for winning if you die seconds before your team wins and hardly any incentive to kill or attack.
---
It has a headlamp?! I didn’t see it on the model D8
---
My backup gun is a two shot auto grenade launcher.  I love using it for line in the sand.
---
From a purely technical standpoint I can see why this would be. NW has one set of challenges, and Adventure Mode has another, so it makes sense that XP tallied while NW is running wouldn’t be counted towards an AM challenge. But in terms of gameplay, as well as the POINT of the award, I don’t like it. That XP should add to the tally, because the whole point of that repeatable XP thing is to reward people for playing. If people are playing NW, they should be rewarded as well!
---
If counting AM XP gathered while playing NW towards the repeatable challenge is too difficult or opens them up to exploitation, then I say they should just have a repeatable challenge for gathering XP in NW as well. It would solve the problem with minimal effort.
---
yup. even if solo in a team
---
My thinking is it should increase max hp without affecting current hp, especially if hp and rads would then overlap.
---
Apparently, I was wrong. It comes out on the 9th, not the 7th!
---
A sniper build is viable. The official strategy guide for the game actually lists a solo sniper build, but I have no idea how 'accurate' it is now. Some of the stuff in the official guide are out of date.
---
Still waiting for a -90% one, in the meantime I'm with the OP, I drop it at the gravesite for someone else.
---
Maybe we aren’t all hard core racing to get to level 100?
---
why do they jump though
---
I started a new character recently - as of yesterday level 28. 
---
I used my main to craft deep pocketed leather armor up to level 20, and then swapped over to BOS deep pocketed combat armor for lvl 20, 30 and 40.
---
Also have a hand-me-down set of lvl 50 1\* and 2\* legendary BOS heavy CA ready.
---
I got mine from the fire breathers quest pretty epic
---
This is exactly why we desperately need a “f*** you” emote. But for now, I just respond with a heart emote and continue do me. It infuriates them even more.
---
why would you even engage in such idiocy ?
---
So they don't get disconnected.
---
I don’t think it’s a bug 😂 
---
They don’t want us having 500% xp gains
---
FOMO isn't a glitch in the system. FOMO isn't a feature of the system. FOMO is the system. It's what we do with this knowledge that matters.
---
As a milquetoast internet commenter, I recommend complaining more and deciding whether or not the game is worth continuing to play. More complaints won't hurt, especially if they're valid. Those that dislike the complaints can simply not read them. Those that are too dissatisfied may quit the game at any time with no real loss. Loyalty will only be rewarded with something else to part you from your money.
---
Yes, I play and enjoy the game. Acknowledging what it is is not actively detracting from my experience. "Thing I like is flawed" should not be a controversial statement.
---
They’re a business, that’s what businesses do - make money.🤷‍♂️
---
And you’re not obligated to buy Atoms.
---
at least with text that could've been some kid, i've gotten similar exchanges over mics. while shopping.
---
in power armor you want to use a 2hand to maximum dmg, if that is what you are after and outside of power armor you should use unarmed weapons.
---
I do believe they show the intention of going on with this.
---
Other AAA titles (Whose name shall not be spoken as to not anger the god of this universe) have perished and did not see this kind of transformation.
---
I do think they had to do this (Wastelanders, SCORE, ETC) but credit where its due. They atleast did it.
---
So yes. I think that 10 seasons is reasonable. Otherwise i owe you a pint lad
---
Standing on buildings is only an issue if you are the one drawing the queens aggro.  You can figure that out by moving if the queen follows you then stay on the ground.
---
Try again.
---
It was Halo 2 for me. Thinking back to how people used to talk to each other on that game, that was ABUSE.
---
Be prepared for people to tell you to just make another character. Starting fresh and leveling a character only to be stuck using it for the next 2.5 months is a reasonable expectation to them.
---
Yeah unfortunately you won't be able to do that unless they add cross-platform support, at which point we would all be on the same servers
---
The last thing they said about cross-platform was that they wanted to do it but Sony said no, Sony has been a bit better lately about doing cross-platform support
---
But at this point idk how difficult it would be for them to combine them all without losing characters/items etc, I have to imagine very
---
Exactly.   
---
I used to put on my chinese stealth armor on and collect all the ores in a circle, I could collect around 50 myself, but then I would miss all the kills.
---
I already have all the rare plans from that event so I  dont care to collect ores anymore, I'm there for the XP. And yes, I do know the event will fail, I don't need to be lectured about it.
---
If they care so much about completion then go collect the ores, just like I did when I wanted the 4/4 reward or ask nicely if anyone is interested to get it done properly, there's no need to treat other like stupid just because don't share the same goals.
---
oh i see...need to be able to report these asshats
---
At first I had no idea who the guy was, I went to a vendor and was just shot and beat by like 6 guys. Guessing they were hoping I would engage
---
I just kept going with him because I message through my xbox app so it's easier and faster and I can keep vendor hopping
---
Another thing, i installed that kind of mod while playing fo4 back in time, to have crit chance. I dunno how to describe, but game became boring pretty fast with high luck, things was dying to fast, like some god mode enabled (we have kinda same shit with bloodied builds). But maybe give crit chance to junkies high HP build to balance things out vs bloodied?
---
Strangler and power armor in general needs a buff too lol
---
club penguin has been shutdown! how dare he! \*wipes a tear\*
---
but at least you guys had a wholesome discussion about family and biology
---
Unfortunately, good luck with that - because if BGS doesn't ban cheaters, they won't ban players for going AFK.
---
I see alot of people saying their exp and movement will be lost at the end of the season....well yes thats how it works...every game that has a season pass/battle pass works this way other wise there is no need to have a time limit on it and we could just go through it at our own pace. Maybe im alone in this but I take pride in playing the game and getting things that maybe not all players get or have otherwise we are all just the same.
---
No no no, we only get bugs that don’t benefit us. The ones that do are patched like the devs have guns to their heads.
---
well if you can't beat 'em....
---
17. According to another post here, I'm behind already, despite doing the dailies and weekly. (I missed a couple NWs though.)
---
G’day Captainoob
---
benefiting from faster reload perk and mutation would be perfect
---
Double xp + group xp + inspirational + berry mentats + cranberry relish + lunchboxes = so much score
---
Club penguin will always be in our hearts
---
It never worked this way in the previous 3d Fallout games.
---
And it's stupid to make it this way, Buffout is a steroid, makes you stronger, imagineyou take some buffout and to get stronger but then you need to stab yourself with a stimpak for it to take effect, doesn't make sense at all.
---
For damage yes. For healing it doesn’t matter.
---
I hope you see this u/ladydevann and can pass along to dev team.
---
won't get anywhere anyway if it keeps bugging out!
---
In WoW what happened if you missed the daily quests/tasks? Were you out of luck or was there some way for people who played for the same amount of time, but all in one go, to catch up. 
---
For example would someone playing 14hrs on a Saturday be able to make the same progress as someone playing 2hrs per day?
---
Now for the people being debbie downers. Don't forget we have a double score weekend coming up at some point. So if you save up your weeklies you should get a decent boost.
---
It's not that big of a deal to be courteous towards others.  You act as if it's either sit afk and do nothing or one shot everything or have to carry another weapon.
---
There are in-betweens here.  Here is my code of conduct that I personally follow for events as a high-level player:
---
I always will take out a weaker weapon or punch to hit a legendary.  To me, this is the most basic of courtesies in the game.  If you  DO NOT want to do this, try to be one of the last people to get your hit in at the very least.
---
In cases of non-legendary mobs, yeah I still do one shot some, but I don't take more than my share.  There's a difference between one shotting a few ghouls at one violent night and sitting at the doorway pre-firing your legacy gatling plasma to mow down every single one that comes through.  Just don't be greedy.Also, if you're a stealth build, there's no reason to go into stealth for an extra 3.75x dmg at a public event with multiple people. 
---
It's really not that difficult.  Just don't one shot the legendary and don't take all the mobs for yourself.
---
which defeats the purpose for obtaining the atoms .. for those of use that like to just earn them and leisurely stock them for new gimmicks on the atom shop .. not everyone is a whale in every game
---
⬆️this!!!!
---
I can't really argue with what you've put, I'm all for buffing the bow side of things.
---
outperform in raw damages, yes, but only the crossbow  is actually a Kind of usable weapon because of VATS and faster reload \ fire rate
---
The workers outfit
---
Don't sleep on Ricochet. 18% chance to further reduce damage is great. On a bloodied build it makes up for the times Dipity fails ands there's no AP for Dodgy and you just can't get away. You feel so much tankier. Same deal on a Junkie build.
---
To be fair, I would rather have less bug-free (or at least somewhat close to it) content than more buggy sometimes literally unplayable content.
---
Won't happen. FOMO will continue to be utilized to its fullest extent. Doing otherwise would cut down on whales blowing atoms to power through the current season. "Oh, I'll just do it later, they say", as a few weeks later they drop the game entirely for something far more shiny and likely just as manipulative.
---
Hahahaha... yeah, ok. I'm not- thank you for all the effort, much appreciated. Now I know exactly why I shouldn't bother with this I suppose. x'D
---
I got a bloodied version that I used exclusively during Fasnacht LOL it's cool. Not particularly useful but cool
---
I was trying to farm some nuked ghouls at WS, but kept having them die standing up, and being unlootable. So much for my plan to refill my stable flux reserves! Also completely froze and had to close out my game midway through shooting one. Luckily thanks to the public teams I was able to rejoin, but it wasn't a very fruitful trip to the golf course that day.
---
I love this concept. It's like the battlepass model, where you have the choice to pay to progress further... But it also actually adds content to the game. It's no longer timed prizes, but it's own permanent progression system you can work towards.
---
It will still earn Bethesda money, while not burning people out from the grind. 
---
This is a very good, and consumer friendly, idea.
---
In my opinion the game needs text chat to even approach feeling like a true MMO. Heck, even multiplayer modes on shooters have text chat. Bethesda corporate just can't be bothered to pay people to moderate it, because they are greedy.
---
All explosive lasers are trash durability wise. They make nice wall ornaments though.
---
Are you on Xbox? I had someone leading the group like that last week or so during the Queen event. It was wonderful. Not all of us know exactly what to do, and it was nice to have someone (kindly) guiding us. I followed the emotes and it seemed to go a lot smoother than the times where players are floating in the sky.
---
Sure is a nice touch.
---
Maybe move my base to the graveyard and sell Shovels for 1c.. . /Ferengi
---
Yup it's rare,  I got my from first thing thirsty,  but in still looking for the helmet
---
If you want maximum melee damage on the queen, go bloodied unarmed, with all the STR from Unyielding armour, damage from melee damage perks and all the food/drugs that increases melee damage, you can kill the queen in a few swings.
---
No, I do use it in the fight. I stay on the ground to get her to land, unload a clip or two on her, then when the horde shows up I jump up on the tent.  When I'm satisfied the horde is dead (particularly those damn cave crickets) I'll go back to ground and try to lure her down again.
---
I ask people to stay off the tents politely on the mike.  If they don't listen (and they usually don't) I move my tent at inopportune moments that get people camping on it killed.  People learn to stay off my tent unless I'm on it.
---
I see what you're saying but not all of age adults have equal responsibilities at this time.  I work 40 hours per week at an office during which I cannot play fallout or any  other games.  But, I have no children or anything like that so when I get off of work for the day I can do what I want.  I have quite a bit of free time being 26 years old with no kids.
---
This kind of behavior doesn’t just happen; it’s learned. Learned from you, I suspect. Good job Dad. Keep doing it right.
---
It's no excuse, I hear you. Just joking. 
---
Now, if you want to hit the pylon, a few tips:
---
Power armor, if you're not strong enough. Pylons constantly drain your health, and can aggro Imposter Sheepsquatch onto you. You need to be a bit beefy to hold the pylon effect, so make sure you have enough stimpaks as well.
---
Be prepared. Check your perks and gear before joining Cryptid. It's a pricey fight to start, and people do get aggrevated when they spend ~2k caps on an instance, just to have it fail from being overwhelmed because players don't know the fight. These are all robot enemies, so make sure you have your armor pen setup ready before joining. 
---
As a pylon toucher, don't stand still. When she fires her laser, it will hit everything in its path, so keep moving. Responsibility for staying alive is on you, but don't stand behind a bunch of players. That being said, no one should be standing still during any point of the encounter. 
---
DON'T ATTACK HER IF SHE'S STILL SHIELDED! Wait for the prompt that she's vulnerable, otherwise you're wasting ammo and grabbing aggro. It's already tough with the swarms of robots, and if they aren't kept in check, the fight gets out of hand very quickly. 
---
Just like every other mmo, there are good, bad and ugly. Try not to let it get to you, and do what you have to (mute chat, block players etc)
---
That being said, it's in your best interest to read up on the encounters/events before joining them.
---
So basically lone wander doesn't block 20% damage? Seriously read the cards. 
---
I mean I'm trying to help people but I'm not handing it to you but its as simple as actually reading the perk cards.... also power armors terrible in pvp 1 pulse grenade you dead
---
also thats not one of the cards :D also last response
---
I just set mine to Team chat only.
---
Mine was no clothing except for the party hat
---
A kid that learns to obtain purified water himself will drink for a lifetime, a kid that is handed purified water will die.
---
Your kid hasn't learned a valuable lesson. He really meant "this guy is unlikely to find water himself. I can just run to communist daddy and beg for a handout"
---
17, completing all dailies but NW ones and Weekly challenges 
---
And the XP from 2x Westek runs for 1400 caps a Day and daily quests for bullion
---
must be nice having a text chat !!!! .. well maybe this isn't the best example .. but more than we get on PC !!!!
---
this is an injustice !! we need to riot !!!!
---
I nearly won last night got my first ever nuke and killed all of us ending the match with a stalemate
---
yes agreed
---
Once you have their money... you never give it back. 
---
1st rule of Ferengi Rules of Acquisition.
---
There’s an old American saying, something to the tune of “the people who got rich during the gold rush weren’t those pulling metal from the earth, but rather those selling the shovels”
---
Well, I decided to take that literally. I set up shop within eyesight of the grave, with a big sign overhead that said “SHOVELS HERE”. Then, I sold shovels in my shop for 700 each. It was one of the scummiest endeavors I’ve ever fielded, but boy did it rake in the caps. 
---
I eventually gave up on it after my third complete rebuild. Apparently vicious capitalism is frowned upon in the wasteland, and I was successfully nuked on three separate occasions. Can’t say I blame them!
---
oh my sweet summer child, you'll know what i'm talking about soon enoguh.
---
I was under the impression he wants the skins previously released for 1st when he pays for a 1st sub. Which I agree with. One I actually liked was the ugly vibrant camo for the leather armor but I missed it bc I didnt own the game then. I pay for 1st and would like access to the old skins. I didnt realize he was asking for the skins to be released on the atom shops. If that's the case sorry for going on the defensive.
---
There also aren’t enough mods for sale. They should let it have VATS Matrix Overlay. That mod is only available for X-01 for some reason... 
---
How about headlamp plans for everything too, besides just x-01. Where are they?
---
If they won’t improve power armor, then they should let us have the backpack bonus underneath it. Which makes no sense, but at least it would balance everything.
---
Warframe has a similar prize track and they only require about 60% of all challenges to complete it, there is also credit tiers beyond all the prizes for people who do more than that.
---
Really? I run with about 5HP and I Hulk Smash the same cars you’re talking about. I don’t take damage.
---
Just kill them and get the points
---
True, I haven't experienced the auto complete yet I've been logged in all but once when the challenges refreshed
---
Okay *one* card that only works when you’re playing alone, as opposed to the dozen other nearly entire perk tree and amazing mutation that only work when you’re on a team. I love how you worded it as if there are soo many cards but there’s literally one and it only works when you play alone.
---
How do those 500 atoms help you finish the legendary run though?
---
[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hm3f2d/legendary_run_score_rundown_guide/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf). It was posted today
---
Which events? As far as I know, the only ones where you can get the mask are the Savage Divide events (Uranium Fever is a good one to try for).
---
I agree this would be a good idea.  While I love the new changes for PvP for adventure mode public teams this really does hurt players who want to engage in friendly group PvP.
---
There shoulda been a text chat like in GTA or any other online lobby game. Pretty stupid there isnt one for PC, seems like it's a common functionality
---
I feel the same way. I’m currently progressing through the season on a heavy guns alt that is based around the public teams and whatnot. My level 275 main though will probably keep Lone Wanderer since he can do everything solo and it’s quite fun playing alone on him. The public teams are a huge QOL improvement, and they actually did well with them.
---
Damn bro, if you're on xbox I'll just give you one
---
Wow, nice. Whats brain bombs?
---
Does it apply to everything or just quest/event completition? I only ask because I just tested it by unequipping it, getting 008 xp for killing an Eyebot then requipping it and killing another eyebot and only getting a 008xp. I was in a public team. I figured this might’ve been a bug but I wasn’t sure.
---
Yea just did the boring math and feel free to correct me if I'm wrong. 
---
25 2mm fusion cores if they weighed the same as a standard one would add up to only 7.5 pounds if you were using Batteries Included. And 25 fusion cores would add up to 24,975 rounds with Power User
---
Now for 24,975 ultracite 2mm EC since it's more ammo efficient to craft than regular 2mm EC would weigh 124.875 pounds with Batteries Included! That's nearly 17 times more weight than the the proposed 25 2mm fusion cores. 
---
So I'm all for the weight reduction if 2mm fusion cores were added.
---
Would be nice if people cite their source. I haven’t seen anything either. They did say they will expand ways to earn score in the future (daily ops for example). If there is something around them specifically commenting on public events I would love to see it.
---
Isn't it courteous to make sure the event completes?
---
You seem to be missing my point. 
---
Why should I have to change my build playing the game I payed for to accommodate newer players. That will complain either way. 
---
Legendaries get shot once. If they die sorry if they don't I walk away. 
---
Normal mobs get killed to move on the event. 
---
Still get complained at for one shotting mobs. 
---
Still get complained at for not shooting mobs. 
---
Your code of conduct is just that. Yours. 
---
You shouldn't expect others to follow your practices. No one else should either. 
---
If you've spent the time getting strong go for it. If you miss out don't worry there will be new chances. 
---
I'm not going to bore myself punching enemies. I'm not going to use my carry weight and switch about my build to accommodate lower levels. 
---
Sounds mean but it's also mean to EXPECT people to be bored at EVERY EVENT while playing so you can get some low tier crap Legendary. That a low level will replace extremely quickly and a pittance of exp from mobs. 
---
Events are designed to be completed. Not to farm mobs.
---
Messenger also pulls rewards from SD pool
---
Speaking of tent placement, I have a spot people don't like to use to stand on that I love. 
---
Standing on the bunker and facing where the queen spawns you'll see a front gate of the drop site. To the right there's a grove of trees, including a fallen one.  I've found that you can place your tent so that the fallen log blocks the stairs into the tent. This means hostile yao guai and crickets can't follow you into the tent. Also, the surrounding trees makes it a piss poor camp spot for snipers wanting to snipe at the queen.  So it allows my tent to be what I intend it to be, an emergency retreat when bum rushed, not a sniping post for shooting the queen from.
---
I’m 32. I use every xp buff you can think of and kill as many high level enemies as I can find. And I play like it’s a full time job.
---
I saw it, but thanks for looking out man! 👍👍
---
I’ve lucked out and been with cool people who wait until she mutates to do that.
---
Nuclear winter has exactly 2 challenges. 1 is the daily. And the second is the gold star, which clearly ties to the other challenges completed in adventure. 
---
Xp should count across.
---
Humans gotta human.
---
I am on Xbox, I don't want one for free I'll pay
---
Is there any pooint where the amount of XP increased for a level up? Because I'm around lvl 170 and I can still gain a level in well under an hour without problems, so just wondering if it will eventually actually get harder
---
I'm level 7.
---
Run events in the savage divide. As far as I know it's the only way these days, that or buy one from someone.
---
There is almost always one in the little building to the right of the site.
---
Okay sure, 100 caps, what's your gt?
---
You will not continue to jump a few levels with each set of weeklies. At only level 40, you will get about 3 levels per set of weeklies. Level 20 is only about 10% of the way to 100, so you're barely ahead of the curve right now.
---
I’ve been waiting for that almost since I’ve started playing a couple months.  I return to her and she just bitches about her back
---
If that's what you're aiming for then your build excels at mediocrity.
---
CoD mobile has a very hard time limited season pass, it’s not a MMO at all, but there it is.  Other platforms have adopted it cause fact is, it makes money.
---
The grind model was arguably perfected by WoW, and used to “retain” not recruit.
---
Similarly in Fallout 76 we see the RNG on legendary drops, be they crafted or looted.  This was based off WoW’s random drop model which was based off the “Skinner Box” concept used on rats to cause repetitive behavior.
---
Also the cap is to create a small milestone and a scarcity mindset to encourage you to horde quickly and spend quickly.  Pray they don’t do this to atomic shop points.
---
It’s all going as it should, some people will be upset by it, but Bethesda isn’t the first to do this and won’t be the last.
---
Shit.
---
Do you know what laundering means? 
---
If you mean that they are trying to manipulate people then that is different. 
---
But the thing is, it's not exactly a secret what they are doing. People point it out all the time. If you fall for that shit, it is mostly on you.
---
/r/thathappened
---
SSD right? I'm thinking it's time to move my game from my 7200rpm hard drive to my SSD. These load times are brutal. I want to know within 5 seconds that I can't place my camp.
---
And? Again, double XP &amp; double daily score weekends need to be taken into account.
---
It is totally understandable that not everyone will get every reward from the season. I still would have liked to see a little more wiggle room built into the score rewards. If it had been structured that daily players meeting all score daily awards would reach level 100 at week 9 instead of around week 10 it would make the grind a little more fun and less stressful.
---
I'm a daily player for over a year but sometimes I only have time to play for 30 minutes to an hour, like the other night when the NW was survive for 30 minutes. Doh! 
---
I'm already fully committed to completing the first season even if I need to use atoms (I've got 14,500 stored with 90% free earned ones). But if the next 10 weeks just feel like an unpleasant grind of daily chores and then I even need to buy levels I might very well just ignore the next season.
---
I don't care about getting to max level in SCORE, it's something added that I like and gets me something as soon as I get levels... nothing too bad for my playstyle
---
This is a bug, we're working on a fix for this but in the meantime enjoy the bonus rewards!
---
How did you guys find out that adrenaline is bugged?
---
Are you using stabilized? Some perks seem to have broken - we all know about Adrenaline and for me fireproof doesn’t work as well as it used to. Maybe something happened with the patch.
---
Nah no worries man, I don't use shotguns and at this point I'm not changing my build. I already play way too much lol.
---
I still want the radiation barrel plan so I'm going after the ore. I could care less about the XP at 310th.  What gets me is when I leave the center room to some idiot who can't keep the ghouls under control, so I go to get ore, come back and all the scavs are dead.
---
A boy doesn't become a man by playing video games, but a man may develop the impatient tendencies of a boy if he plays video games too seriously.
---
I've always used Napalmer tank on my flamer and bashing is needed to heal NPCs. The flame from my (Napalmer) flamer will heal other players as expected.
---
I agree with you. In my opinion, the grind should be lessened a bit in some way. I’m not saying make it super easy, just a little more accessible for the average folk (maybe a few more challenges or stop SCORE requirements from increasing with rank past a certain point). It’s also worth mentioning this is the first season, so Beth has the chance to reevaluate and alter future seasons based on how this one goes. I know some people might think that’s way too optimistic with Beth, but anything can happen.
---
For real I'm really casual now and I have no idea what im doing with most events. The people that take the time to be nice and explain are superstars thank you guys so much.
---
Look man, it's not that deep.  It's just about being courteous to others.  When someone one shots a legendary or takes all the XP from mobs at an event I don't get bothered for myself.  I have everything I could ever need but I do feel for the other players who get frustrated at this.  I'm not saying you need to do what I do but I was just telling you that there are ways to carry yourself at events, be helpful, and still get your fair share.
---
At the end of the day, it boils down to this: The way the game awards drops and XP isn't very well thought out for a multiplayer game.  Until they possibly ever address this, I'll be sharing with everyone else.  I hope you do too.
---
July 23 weekend is double score for dailies
---
1 is still too loud.
---
Dude if you don’t like these post why look at them.
---
Oh nice one. I mean.... I got some dudes at my camp before patch 20 they want pvp so bad and start spamming nuke mines on me ( I'm a bloodied) while I'm sitting on my chair at my bar. He didn't stopped for 30 mins after I 'finally' agree for pvp. Took 1 seconds and a single hit with my boxing glove to destroy him in his PA lol. Finally I had some fun in this half hour then he left my camp instand and never came back....
---
Damage isn’t stacking from enemy to enemy. Also, the effect isn’t showing up under stats in the pip boy.
---
I figured out last night that if you go up to the ally progression and click on it than it will give you the option to leave the team. 2050 hours and I just found out.
---
Good idea but won't happen. Not how battlepasses/seasons works.
---
Don't worry, they'll realize just how bad it gets around level 40, and it's only downhill from there.
---
Same.  I don't want to grind this shit.
---
I was bored with it by the time I got the ammo converter.  I'm ignoring it now.  If I earn score, I earn score.  If I don't, I don't.  It's not worth the effort IMO.
---
Ive been doing messenger, one violent night, uranium fever
---
Yes, I head a private RP server that also does in-game things. Msg for details.
---
We will absolutely need the break after the season let me tell you what
---
NERDER 01
---
Seriously. Those are the guys I want to play with.
---
Seriously this is what does it for me.  When they first started talking about a challenge revamp, they acknowledged that everyone hated how dumb and disjointed from actual gameplay the challenges were....   It made it sound like they wanted to add new, exciting challenges.  Instead, we got a _new reward system with nearly the same exact challenges._ It's so mind boggling.
---
Tried moving your camp and deleting the blueprint?
---
Well done Dad!!!
---
Thanks for the tips.
---
Nowadays I know how to handle pylons, Encrypted is one of my fav events.
---
But since I had that experience in the past  I know how players might feel if they are being mistreated by others for not performing as expected. It's humiliating and nobody deserved to feel bad.
---
I realized just right off the bat that I wasn't going to make it to 100 under my own steam. The captain cosmos stuff is cool, but not cool enough for me to commit to playing daily for 10 weeks in the absence of any new content. My hope is to get to 76 on my own steam to get the T65 paint but if I don't, I don't.
---
Yeah....it's like a 0.01% drop rate.
---
Does this factor in the 150 Atom skip option? Let’s say you use the Atom rewards to skip a level, how much time can that shave off?
---
What would make sense is the traps that the Free States made.
---
Shoot, even at level 165, I still carry weapons that use different ammo types. Each has a strength and a better fit, depending on the situation. Plus, if I run out of ammo for one, I still have the other 2.
---
The grind week.
---
That that's gonna help unless you save them till season 2
---
It is hilarious seeing the same responses with people thinking they are original.
---
It is why I enjoy posts like "my girlfriend got me this" because 90% of the posts are "NICE! IS SHE SINGLE?"
---
Thanks. That is a really good view. Ive passed this location a few times and never noticed it! Might end up making it here. My camp is actually northwest-ish of this spot, between the mountains in sort of a campout area. Too small to really build much though.
---
That would almost be the battle that never was, an event that has long since been removed.
---
My favorite is when some chode isn’t happy with where I launched the nuke. I just tell them to go launch their own and they usually come up with some lame excuse or lie and say they’re on cool down.
---
Can you imagine what it’s like to be that guy though?  What a weirdo. Go to PP when it seems a chunk of people are there.  It’s amazing how smoothly it can go if everyone knows what to do and will work together.  The world is full of dipshits. Don’t let them ruin things for you.
---
I will continue to just play my game however I wish. Whichever way results in complaints and hate mail from lower levels. I may as well get something extra from it too. 
---
I won't change how I play or my setup or punch things as that's boring. 
---
I would add I'm glad that people are stronger when I was lower level because I could ask how they did it. I could learn from players that excel to help me get stronger. 
---
If every player walked around nerfed no one would strive to become stronger.
---
Generously Ending Nerfed Expiditions
---
And log out at least 20 minutes before the reset. So tedious to play this game...
---
For the most part if its limited time, like a holiday event, then you could maybe on fixed things make up som  but not as much as if you did repeatables.  The midsummer festival is a good example of that.  
---
Other things like “Wrath pre-launch event” were you either did it or didn’t get it, and the rewards are lost to time.  Also loss of mounts for achievements, like ahead of the curve, were limited to only being before the next chunk of content dropped.
---
I’ll never get my proto-drakes from Naxx, and never did, it’s just how that worked out.  Same for Corrupted Ashbringer, although it did get featured as a skin eventually.
---
Also WoW would go out of its way to invalid non-current gear.  If Fallout 76 did this then you’d never see anyone in less than T-65 cause everything would be obliterated by newer mobs.  But currently there aren’t dungeons so I don’t see that happening soon.
---
You have to mark it in the atom shop menu.
---
Aight I am out.. This is just too much. I wish we could at least select from a pool of rewards or something at specific points so I could get the three items total that I want..
---
U go to the atom store and choose it as ur outfit for nw... note as soon as u get armor tho it gets removed.
---
How do you even buy tiers?
---
How is it misleading no one said you had to do this but I figured everyone is freaking out about not being able to finish and this may alleviate some of the stress o. People
---
Yeah, thats usually where I build. Gets a lil boring being able to turn 360 degrees and see nothing but the edge of the map and trees tho. All the swampy areas I like have set spawns id rather not deal with
---
Clearly someone woke up in the wrong side of the bed
---
If you start you foundations on the highpoint and build back towards the water, it can be a pretty big build, and then use tiers of concrete foundations to hide any floating foundations. That's what I did, and ended up with basically a two-storey warehouse!
---
Yeah, Sheepsquatch is a tank. I was on my alt that was level 15 at the time with my friend and his alt at level 22 and we ran into a Sheepsquatch at Lewisburg. We kept fighting it until we got up to the train station where it couldn't get to us and just threw everything we had at it. I broke all of my guns, used all of my molotovs and frag grenades and had to resort to running in and swiping with my baseball bat and running back out. It took about 10 minutes but we eventually killed it, lol.
---
Yes. The game is likely to get more popular too.
---
Obviously, not Bethesda, but Zenimax completely turned around Elder Scrolls Online to the point where it is now the second most popular MMO in the world (by all accounts, it has more active players that FF14)
---
Zenimax would likely allow Bethesda to spend money on Fallout 76. This is NOT a company that wants to give up on their games.
---
Now I can leave all my excess ammo outside Vault 76!
---
It take you hours to finish the daily ones? Really it just 30min for me
---
Lmao you mad
---
How do you make them.all spawn like that? I thought it was just a glitch.
---
Nothing will be added to this game that genuinely changes it for the better. Nothing. We will only see mechanisms set up to keep player count high and push microtransactions. Worst part of it all though is it's highly unlikely this will change with anything other than an international class action against Bethesda.
---
Grind is just that, a grind. It kills any chance of another 76 game...or maybe even another Fallout game until some other company buys the IP.
---
SS is not tradable
---
Agreed. Friends on Xbox, playable framerates on PC.
---
Yup. It's even better with confetti mess lunchbox buff. Bodies and confetti everywhere. Then you hobble inside with 1400 weight of guns and stuff and spend ten minutes scrapping it all. 
---
The XP and resources are insane even if it's technically not ethical or the way it's supposed to go, it's WAY more fun than the intended way.
---
I’ll see if I can find the post. But I don’t think anything was cited. Someone mentioned that it was like the mask thing, but that’s a stretch. 
---
Statements made in press releases compared to in-game mechanics are not the same thing.
---
Ofc you would, but bethesda doesn't make enough money from that system.
---
Please, no more shitty terminals at our camps..
---
I get that.
---
That not how seasons works, they have to be time exclusive for it to work or it be a massive grind.
---
I have TSE musket and muzzle load pistol and would love to join the group
---
Isn’t ESO heavy on the micro transactions though
---
are you "hidden" when the assaultron part starts? it may just be acting like nothing is there
---
Simping ain't easy.
---
What a twist, you shattered my view of reality. I said one thing and then you said the opposite of that thing now i'm like  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBr8mcLj9QY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBr8mcLj9QY)
---
I'd be lying if I said I did different, in fact I think I carry about 9 rifles or something stupid like that.
---
hahaha Yes, I know how that feels.  
---
It's incredibly annyoing, I get it, but then again we cannot control the way other people play.  
---
A good idea is to organize forces before the start and if for some reason the event fails because they cannot keep the ghouls under control, don't insult the other players. Just accept the failure and try again next time, you know, have a little bit of tolerance to frustration.
---
I beg beg beg to see this. I was doing poses at my friend's camp when this dude came up, brought his buddies, and then all got down to their underwear. Best pictures ever. People like you guys and the 'nude group' prove that there's still some normalcy to the game. :)
---
Yea it a service game so it still get upgrade as long as they making money
---
And the Camo Secret Service Backpack, lol.
---
Sadly it's accepted as the norm after the first day of a patch.  XIV raiding isn't fun anymore.
---
I haven’t done this daily in a while. Other than the xp from doing the daily is there a reason to do it now?
---
Take the perk off until its fixed, keep the card and points though, there are loads of great agility perks.
---
What they said, any skins ya want to have available in NW you have to "favorite" it. Only one helm/outfit skin, as many or few of the weap skins as you'd like.
---
did you not read the actual post, i own the game on the bethesda launcher and he has it on steam.
---
The only reason it was nerfed was because of the practical affects crashing the game after so many stacks got onto an enemy. &amp; it was said somewhere that it wasn't Bethesdas intentions on nerfing it that hard. They're just too dumb to figure how to not have the acid particals continuously stack.
---
1. "Works on my machine" ain't worth a dime with contrary complaints left and right. It shouldn't be happening in the first place, and the devs should be jumping to compensate the people screwed by it instead of ignoring/locking tickets. See you in a little while when yet more dailies are irreversibly lost to the void.
---
2. Anybody who went out of their way to do the old challenges will inevitably disagree with you on this. The older challenges awarded far more atoms for purchasing what you wanted from the store instead of putting you on a grind towards something you MIGHT want.
---
3. Yes, this is preference, but many would prefer the system this replaced because it would allow them to CHOOSE what they're getting.
---
4. Double daily challenges for a weekend does not equate to a week of lost challenges, assuming it stops at a single week and doesn't continue for another month like other serious bugs.
---
5. This is forced if you want to acquire atoms without constantly shelling out real world money. People have to play a decent amount every single day for the entire season just to get a third of the atoms they would have earned before on the previous system.
---
do you have an actual, helpful answer?
---
Nope, I've tried shooting around, throwing grenades but nothing happens
---
will do, thanks. ign: marijuaustin
---
I love players like you.
---
Cosmetics (mostly)
---
You can buy XP scrolls, I guess. However, there is no need. You get like 15 per month from the login rewards. I don't think there is any microtransaction that will make your life easier. The one exception, I guess, would be allowing you to buy skyshards on a new character, but this only unlocks when you have collected all the skyshards in a zone for a character. It only saves you like an hour or two of time.
---
Rank 1 of gun-fu is amazing!
---
Ah yes, good point because that is the only problem with this suggestion.
---
No. Just no.
---
 What makes you think you deserve membership rewards when you weren't a member? I really do not understand your logic at all.
---
&gt;Fucken hell, you’re acting like I want to take something away from you smh...
---
 Incorrect. You are acting like the people who received EXCLUSIVE bonus rewards for paying the months they were released in don't really deserve them to be exclusive. 
---
 Even though the way they sold it stated that they would be exclusive.
---
I'm sorry you missed out but that's just the way it is. 
---
You're barking up the wrong tree anyway. You have to convince Bethesda not me.  But I guarantee you there will be major backlash from fallout 1st subscribers who agree with me that you are NOT ENTITLED to rewards that 1st members got by paying for the months that we received them in.
---
 Now if they had a system that let current fallout 1st members purchase past fall out 1st rewards for let's say 1600 Atom's each, then I wouldn't have a problem with that.
---
Yes. You should get XP for getting ore.  I feel like I am always left to get ore and heal those idiots and some people spend the whole time killing.  I like the idea that different people fall into different roles during these events. As a teacher I find it fascinating how well things can work sometimes as people naturally take on a responsibility. But it pisses me off that There is no real benefit to being one of the non killing jobs.  Same happens in project paradise where I run around faithfully protecting and keeping track of Pinchy the Bloatfly rather than murdering everything.  Murdering is important but so is keeping track of whatever the animal is because they run off crazily and try to fight stuff.  You know.  If you’ve been there you know.  They made a game and events that require people working together in various ways but don’t reward the various ways.  Whatever.
---
My favourite tactic is using my auto grenade launcher. Only need to fire one to get the splash damage xp without hogging all the kills.
---
I remember playing it for the first time wanting to be an imperial, but nope, it was locked as paid item.
---
Imagine judging an entire community over a single persons actions. 
---
That's never been seen as a bad thing ever...
---
Personally I just cant play 76 anymore, it isnt fun, it's too heavily monetized and while I like new shit, it's gotten too confusing for us casuals
---
I don't care how many years WoW has done it, FOMO is a shitty tactic.
---
You know what, I'm fucking amazed that the gauss weapon bugs are still around, but then again.. there's tons of ancient bugs big &amp; small still around.. so..
---
That was a line from the movie Beverly Hills Cop. I knew it would be a bit of an obscure reference, but I thought at least a few people would get it.
---
it says 15% morexp so i would assume it is 155 on everything. 
---
You need to kill something that gives more xp
---
Leveling up is what takes most of the time and they have put a challenge of gain a level almost every single day.
---
Not quite as bad. It's 0.15%. That's still a 1:666 chance and thus potentially a lot of events to grind...
---
Craftable consumable. Kinda pain in the ass to craft since it requires 3 sugar bombs per piece (and only the irradiated ones, game refuses to use pristine ones for that recipe) so I switch to brain fungus soup from time to time.
---
I loved this and feel mostly the same..  its opened up a whole new path for me.  I don't have a mic so I find teaming up clunky.. but you can get lucky and find a good group now!
---
This would be a heavy blow to their monetization of seasons though. The limited time nature of the later rewards is likely what will get people to get their wallets out
---
Oh they are on your team? Nah thats fucked. I queue up solo if I'm just goofing around I dont want to bring down my team. If I'm on a team I participate as best I can
---
I swear fallout76 are the most entitled gamer 
---
It a new feature that many players are enjoying  , if they reach rank 100 or not it doesn’t matter because they enjoying it
---
1 int is 2%, im fine with 8-9 base int on my characters, means i just need to kill 1 extra mutant vs 15 int character. Basic uny gear 1 star like 400-500 caps, adrenal serum like 300-400 caps. If you dont want to go bloodied to get extra int, just dont. Im fine with not hitting 100, will stop at 78 maybe for handmade skin. Im just tired of people wanting all things funneled them for free doing nothing, you either do the grind, or just accept not hitting rank 100, not a big deal
---
Thanks to this event and the tent trick I finally had a use for all those Tesla rifles I've been collecting. It's totally ridiculous and so much more fun than the event has been since I was low-level.
---
They have no reason to put an end to rmt ... it benefits them it benefits the player and it benefits the seller . If someone is committing to pay real life cash for items that only keeps them playing longer and longer , they are less inclined to stop playing as they’ve spent money on the game , they are less likely to go on a rant due to a bug or whatever people complain about and consequently take a “ break “ from the game . It benefits Bethesda hence why they don’t put an end to it ... if a player has played hundreds of hours and still not gotten there dream bloodied explosive weapon to the point they are sick and tired and on the verge of giving up and stop playing ... yet they can buy it for $20 on eBay . Boom they buy it ... they are satisfied continue playing ... there is no resolution to this in any way shape or form as it is to late . The RNG / LOOT POOLS they have all been established for over a year now ... and it will remain that way . My personal opinion let’s hear yours !
---
If you want something earn it dont whine
---
Especially since it’s still up on the FAQ on the official seasons page.
---
I didn’t even attempt to craft that one because it looked like it just colored the torso instead of adding a jetpack 😅
---
This one is beyond bad man. It's unusable
---
That is a future vault overseer right there.
---
Yea I agree with that but I found a great trick for it , when you see that challenge on your daily , Start a new character you get the challenge done way faster with a low lvl
---
Nono mate, we talking about general exp gain during double exp weekend, not score weekend
---
Personally leather armour sets till 15 then trapper armour sets these have rad resist and help out when doing the toxic valley quests.
---
After that should be able to start getting some sort of low level Legendaries together and work from there
---
It is possible.  I run a mule. The camp of said mule is at Whitesprings Station, a popular camp spot for merchants. I often will go there with my main account and see if the area is clear before starting up the mule's game.  When I have the mule join the server the camp of the mule starts appearing instantaneously, well before the mule loads in.  So yeah, they can do it if they wanted to.
---
Nothing this season interesting to me, most likely will be similar in the following seasons. I will still play the hell out of the game, after they fix adrenaline. Until then I'm focused on gaining my sweet rewards for season 21 on Diablo3.
---
Yea, its legacy code. Just like the legacy items in-game it cannot be touched, lol. As in legacy == awesome to the users, thus making the code awesome as is!
---
It made it seem like you had some super secret strat or something for the run. Nope just spend atoms. Which is what the season pass is already heavily geared towards. They want you to spend the atoms to level up the score.
---
If you find one out it as a favorite and always carry it with you since it a repeatable daily
---
I guess I'll give up now, not even half way to the first week's goal.
---
Put crossbow in scrip machine. Repaired!
---
No, it does not. Camp placement is determined at load start - and anyone near your camp will see your camp the instant you join the world and well before your client is fully loaded in.
---
Why "those people" just can't go and play NW? Or the whole idea is to kill players with unoptimized for pvp build with thier pvp build so they can feel good about themselves?
---
Free shit is free shit.  I love my new ammo converter, I'm thankful they put that early on the board.  Yes, it is not a great user experience but then think of all the little increments of time we save when looting ammo boxes and corpses, now that we can just grab all the ammo knowing it will be of use regardless of what guns we're using.
---
I believe you can buy it back, or at least you used to be able to.
---
Man I thought the GTA tryhards were bad

I've tried playing Fallout 76 several times since i bought it - heavily discounted - over a year ago, but on each occasion the first thing I shoot has a rubberbanding healthbar, which I find infuriating and also hilarious given the amount of time passed between my attempts, and the length of time the game has been out now without this being fixed. I dont understand how people get past this frustration to stick with the game, or how this hasn't been the devs most important bug to fix. I suspect, therefore, that they cannot fix it.
---
I love the Fallout universe and MMOs but the only good thing I have found in 76 from these two passions of mine was that the story seemed quite intelligent and thoughtful. But the gameplay  feels like a chore between the bugs and having no text chat, and having to build a camp (not a feature i enjoyed in 4; again it felt like a chore but one that if i didnt do meant id miss out on a core part of the game).
---
I'm all in favour of optional player-housing but when it's forced on me that's a turn-off. Fallout games were better without this aspect, in my opinion.
---
I really wanted 76 to be a proper MMO, with big social hubs, guilds, hundreds or thousands of players on every server, but instead I feel like we got a FPS multiplayer lobby tacked on to a Fallout RPG with a crateload of bugs that wouldn't get past QA if it was Fallout 4.
---
Unfortunately, i do not think the game has been built with foundations that will make it possible for me to ever like this game, although I do occasionally think about playing again just to see all the story. It all makes me sad. I havent even touched on their supergreed business plans for the game, which should be highly repellent to anyone who doesn't like being exploited...
---
If you enjoy this game, more power to you, but i would urge people not to pay for cosmetic items or 'priviledges' which should be available to everyone equally without them conjuring the concept of extra fees for them. It's pure corporate greed.
---
Go into atomstore and select as a NW favorite. It will now automatically be equipped when you log in
---
Yes, it'll barely counteract the points people have been losing the past week when challenges bug out. Assuming they step up and fix the bug instead of letting it run rampant another week. Or month.
---
But hey, assuming you logged in every day to do challenges, had NONE bug out on you, and used the double daily weekend, you'll only need... a few dozen repeatable challenge completions? We're almost at a semi-reasonable rate!
---
1. There is an easy work around.  Like I said it should be a top priority fix but there is a way to avoid it.
---
2. Yes it did award more atoms but like I said, I wasn't motivated to do the challenges before, now I am.  There are others like me as well.  Maybe not the majority but tough to tell isn't it?
---
3. I still get to choose.  I can go buy atoms just like I always did and choose what I want.  All of the battle pass stuff is literally extra for me.  This is great.  I'm getting MORE than I ever did with this new system.
---
4. Just log off for 20 minutes when dailies are about to reset and get back on and you will never lose a challenge again.
---
5. You can't say "this is forced if you want..."  That phrasing alone is contradictory.   This is not mandatory.  It is only cosmetics.  No one needs to have anything that is in the atom shop.
---
I bet you cant handle a nuka mine dropped by you though
---
Congrats.  I’m over 2000 hours and have yet to see it drop.
---
If you are a neophyte to trading, be sure to use a courier for something like this.  People have already pointed you in the right direction.
---
Correct.
---
I’ve only been playing a month or so. Did you play that event?
---
You still can buy it back unless you leave the machine.
---
Which one specifically are you speaking of?
---
So this!! Oh, and a mini map in the corner, like normal games. That "map" they have now is trash
---
You can, but they disappear as soon as you exit the machine.
---
Honestly comments like this are just somebody trying to make other people as miserable as they are. Now you are going to get a shit ton of comments telling you how much you suck.
---
I rarely hear people talk on PS4, but I do hear all the background noise unless I turned all that off at some point.  Now I wonder if I've ever made people rage to the point of cursing.  Never been stalked in game thankfully.
---
Don't play with a mic, don't care to.
---
The ghillie from the legendary run. I was so excited to use it. https://youtu.be/huUX-OxCrc8
---
\*sob\* i want the fireplace...  
---
at place 99...  
---
FML.
---
The fact that the character hasn't loaded in yet hardly means the connection and loading process isn't in progress. The actual character loading in is going to be one of the *last* steps in the connection. 
---
What people are asking for is for the system to effectively query each server to see if a CAMP spot is available before having to go through the full connection and loading cycle. Once CAMP bits start appearing in-world, that process is already going.
---
Ty for doing the math didn’t want go that far but the idea to consolidate to a high capacity cartridge/core would be ideal and make the gauss more popular I would think.
---
Plus you wouldn’t have to craft it so much like the 556 , .45 etc and it would save on much needed space for sure.
---
I think that mostly depends on what u want from the game. Its a grindy game yeah. So casuals are a bit left out or feel that way.
---
They should do something about that. And i think SCORE is a step in the right direction. They give you insentive.
---
Instead of getting atoms and waiting months till something good comes out in the shop. You just straight up get stuff. You just pick what u want and grind towards that. You don't need to get to 100
---
But i do get that feeling. For my part. I set my own goals and focus on that. Makes the game way more fun
---
I just kept one and have it displayed in my camp to grab when needed
---
Encrytid is just a bad event since they increased the damage you take from the pylons, it's just not worth it when most of the time all you get is a fedora
---
Yeah, I do. That must be it. Thanks for highlighting that for me.
---
I can hold out until the accuracy issue is fixed, but it's totally broken if the armour ignoration has gone too.
---
Only downside now is that anyone can drop in without invite, and they might be dicks, or be terrible over their mic. As far as that can affect your game, I think it's limited enough and you can release them from the group/block them easy enough. I played largely lone wanderer perk and only tried to group up in events, or if someone was nearby a POI that I wanted to FT to without paying caps. Now I have 3 "teammates" that provide me stat bonuses and FT points for their camps/tent &amp; themselves and I can largely keep playing solo if I want.
---
Really glad they implemented this so well (I'm playing with others much more than before but still casually dropping in and out of groups), so I'm really hoping they don't snap-back and nerf these bonuses to be proximity based. Because the map it too big to want to run the around as a squad to every Quest/Event the entire time that I have to play.
---
My dude i just got platinum on playstation, I can totally help you
---
Yup.  Makes even more sense.
---
Really glad to hear. Please add me too! (Same handle)
---
You can't yet, is going to be available next week
---
And the Imperial has awful racial bonuses, which means if you do buy it, you are at a disadvantage. Only real 'bonus' to playing as Imperial is that you unlock the racial style book automatically, but that is it.
---
It was a bonus for those who bought the Imperial Edition of the game when it was first released.
---
That my plan getting to lvl75 or higher by the last day , then tossing a $20 plus the 1500 atoms to finish up
---
tbh I'd actually like to see some kind of roles you assume in these group quests, play as a defender and score more points hanging on to the pylon, whatever, but just something to get people on a strategy
---
note: 'win and get stuff hurrrray' is a goal, not a strategy
---
Yeah most gaming companies are generous like that, Bethesda will allow you to catch up if you spend your atoms now.
---
I really do like the look of the imperial gear
---
How do you expect the game to support development and server costs without monetisation?
---
Also, what do you feel compelled to buy?
---
And please stop telling me what type of gun to use at event. Smh.
---
Save any atoms for the last week, higher levels are harder to complete so buying low level would be waste
---
Chase it with an X-Cell and you'll be fine, at least until the X-Cell wears off. Psychotats is what you want, not Psychobuff.
---
Watch out for scammers eager to pray on returning players with legacy items ...
---
Or you know he’s made a decision in this game that made me proud of him and I wanted to share it. Also he’s 9. He doesn’t understand communism and simply wanted to help someone.
---
Very. I'm trying to get the helmet for mine at the moment which is just as bad.
---
Thank you!
---
Thanks!!
---
So save your earned atoms for the later levels. When xp is high.
---
In a public group of 4 set for building you can gain control like crazy. Switch the group to events at the end of the event for that xp as well. I believe there’s a 30s to a minute delay. 
---
I was hitting the 10k xp after 3 events with some random kills in between.
---
Seems like doing the repeatable for the early levels is the way to go. I’m on 25 before today’s switch and don’t feel like I’m trying that hard.
---
And also let events give SCORE. Have double XP weekends, and just be more player friendly. 10 weeks is reasonable, but not when you have this much of a grind.
---
Queen fights are all about balance, one the big girl is on the ground it's all over and there are plenty of players needing to do some ranged damage just like there are plenty that need to get up close and Boop her on the snoot!
---
If she lands too early I think more people miss out so if I can get agro I try to keep her in the air for at least 4 or 5 minutes. A queen fight is no fun without at least a couple of waves of trash mobs...
---
I just finished max foundation rep, I HATED every second of it lol what rep are you at with them?
---
Ah, my mistake.
---
This is a great idea, I love the sympto-matic machine.
---
Hello, second job :)
---
stop lecturing others on how to lecture others
---
Gotcha. I usually pawn those off on the robot vendors, but I can start a mall chemicals section I think. I usually have 20+ buffout on me at the least, so I can spin up several things. Honestly, I've not been making serums or chems in ages... time to break bad I suppose. :D :D :D
---
The dailys award between 3 and 7 scrip (or something like that) depending on the region of the map.
---
They are new and they don't make up for anything. All the new one are not even 300 atoms. You could do that in 5 days before.
---
The revuve players and craft swords also don't give any rewards for now.
---
Oh yeah... I recently started rocking the Gauss Shotty as well and I 100% concur they suck at killing SBs. They don't do any damage to them while they're in flight. Even though mine is one of those magic shotguns people are always going on about it still doesn't matter if VATS just doesn't land the shot, which it rarely does on SBs even after they land. Manually shooting them instead often ends up rubber banding the health bar. I can't complain too much though, that's literally the only drawback to this weapon as it one shots everything (and multiple things if they're close together) else, including Sheepsquach.
---
Conserve ammo with headshots, sneak attacks and meleeing when you can.  Using guns with different ammunition helps too.
---
You'll find it actually gets worse at high level as mob HP goes up faster than gun damage and you'll need to start crafting your own constantly with ammo smith and super duper.
---
Taking advantage of magic shotguns is always a good idea.
---
I'd have just kept vendor hopping and let them waste caps chasing me round the map.
---
Yeahhh
---
Sweet! I’m gonna on and off like all day today. psn is same as my reddit, ralinor.
---
Can you explain it better?
---
can you elaborate? i've been dying to resolve this problem but cannot find any specifics. thanks in advance
---
portable unit, huh? I got those 15 amp breaker blues myself
---
Awesome, thanks for the info
---
Generators generate electricity, man. Electricity activates water purifiers. The purified water is sold at 5 caps. 280 a day is 1400 caps. Others prefer to spend their resources on crappy wallpapers.
---
Everything you need is in the first 6 levels of Season 1. Everything after that is cosmetic and non-essential for your gameplay experience. Not worth FOMO’ing over imho.
---
27 or 28.
---
And have what to show for it after 3 months? A fireplace entrance that takes up 1/5th of my camp budget?  The grind is really only worth it up to level 5, after that you start wasting your precious time and I recommend anyone that respects theirs doesn't put up with it either.
---
my wife yelled at me, but she didn't know where to put the tent either
---
Funnily enough I always think of WoW when reading a lot of comments on here.
---
Don't you need to talk to them about being together to get the lovers embrace.
---
Interesting.  What system?
---
Gonna do my best not to spend them so I get some atoms for the atomic shop. Will only use them on the last day
---
I have been grinding them the past few days. It shows progress for the Survivor event items, it doesn't show for the Halloween / Xmas stuff. Only item I have left is the winter coat.
---
Im on ps4 as well and one time we were bush camping in nw and i was getting tired of it i wanted some action so i started shooting there a second later this guy plugs his mic and says WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU WHY YOU FUCKING SHOOTING YOU GIVING AWAY OUT POSITION GO EAT A DICK MAN. Granted i was a dick but it was still funny as hell.
---
Neighborly. A bit over halfway through that.
---
18 only missed two dailies so far
---
Aight if thats what you're into lol
---
It's way faster just selling bulked junk imo tho
---
I'd love to see some cooking ones. Cook X different kinds of soup. Cook X different kinds of meat. Cook X different kinds of desserts.
---
Delbert Winters giving you a little smile from beyond, you know?
---
Oh, just go do One Violent Night sometime and try to complete the objective. You'll learn things about your mother's habits that you never imagined.
---
If it was, the whole game would break probably. Good advice on creating, but pray rng is on your side
---
LMAOOOOOO that is fucking hilarious my Todd they really outdid themselves this time.  Holy shit.
---
I think they nerfed explosive bait too. I have seen it just laying around on the ground and could not shoot it to get it to explode. No mention in the notes, but I have not had anyone destroy my camp with it since the update which is nice.
---
this is the hidden feature that totally justifies that $14 a month
---
This is the case for CoD: MW as well. You can miss a few days and be totally fine. Hell, I completed the BP for that game last night, giving me 29 days to spare, and I’m an average player. If events gave score, you weren’t forced to play NW, and they extended the end date by 1-2 weeks, and have double XP weekends, then it’d be pretty damn reasonable, and there shouldn’t be anything stopping them from changing it, right?
---
hit 27 last night.  
---
backstory: played to lv15 from launch and then stepped away until Patch20. logged about 40hrs since then!
---
I play on xbox one x and it's like a slide show most of the time. Have to mash buttons because they don't register during the micro-stutters. Poor optimization I guess.
---
Vanguard.sentinal.ap refresh.👍
---
I bet my wallet those 2 scums wouldn't behave like that if they were in a room with those people irl.
---
Yes, you do.
---
Buy any reduced weight shovel you can find, I know others have said this sorry, but it's the best solution.
---
On another note, I wish wish there was a digging animation. The settlers do it so it's easy enough to add into the game. Would be fun at treasure map sites too. (As long  as we could still spam the dig button anyway)
---
But we are getting a lot of content next month 2 BoS events and meat week
---
Use 10mm smgs, pump shotguns, a decent .38 weapon, a hunting rifle, and a ski sword from top of the world if you can get one and use it
---
For full health Vanguard's is typically the best as you get more DR/ER the higher your health. Though, I prefer a mixed set of Chameleon, Troubleshooters, Zealots, Ghoul Slayers and Mutant Slayers. That provides a reduction in incoming damage from the majority of enemies I come up against. If you're melee Strength is a good second (I think it's second) otherwise AP Refresh is a good secondary perk, especially if you use VATS. As for the third I personally don't mind anything but the lockpick. any weight reduction or additional to sneak is useful.
---
I pray for everyone that their dailys dont bug.
---
Great job Dad. Raise kind people, that’s more important than ever.
---
I loved golden eye. I really feel if they took the same energy they are using to fight against dupers and sellers and quit swimming upstream against the river and give legacies back and created new armors and increased drop rates even if only a small amount for old pvp gear then it would make a huge difference in the game. Even if they dropped a random pvp arena in the game world and put a pvp gear vendor ingame that had random gear and weapons that would be cool too. They could do a pvp reward system for the best team each week. Limit chems, bobbleheads, magazines and nuka quantums to cary in each game and make it an epic match. They would be overloaded with ppl in their servers daily lol
---
That makes no sense. Putting a camp in the same place as yours? The game will simply tell you to move to another world or you can stay but your camp will not be placed, even if both camps are completely empty. Your point literally makes no sense because there are dozens of workshop items that can be placed without any sort of "4x4 foundation" to keep track of where things can be placed. It being online changes absolutely nothing. You have your own camp boundaries and you can place anything you want inside regardless of foundations with the sole exclusion of regular walls.
---
I have yet to figure out how to hear people on mic. Is it because I don't use one? I've fiddled with all sorts of volume controls.
---
I just want to mass exchange ammo at the ammo converter...
---
Vanguard for full health. Good modifiers are AP refresh, +1 to any special, weight reduction, auto stim. Any of those. Add +50 Fall Damage on TWO armor pieces and you can jet pack all over Appalachia.
---
For Silo runs or Encryptid, I'd aim for Troubleshooter. Slap dense of the chest and buttressed on all others and they become a walk in the park.
---
Not like we can do anything about it
---
You probably received them earlier. Some of them award the score when it's 3/5 completed. What rank are you at?
---
No kidding. At least I grinded till leather which was what I wanted. Can't wait for those grinding for combat/scout or SS. Boy they're gonna be salty.
---
1. I lost my set of dailies three times over the past week, staying logged off for 3+ hours on both ends of the daily reset. Easy work around, my ass.
---
2. Friend, do you really need somebody to make a poll asking which system people preferred? I think you and I both know the answer at this point.
---
3. "I just always bought atoms, I don't see the problem" I'm starting to see a pretty big one.
---
4. See 1
---
5. There are quite literally gameplay-enhancing upgrades sold on the atom shop like automatic resource generators, food spoilage reducers, etc. Only cosmetics, my ass.
---
I really don't like calling people paid shills over these sorts of things, instead preferring the benefit of the doubt, but I'll be damned if the combination of "what's not to like", "works on my machine", "just pay more money", and the blatant lying about paid features really doesn't raise numerous red flags right now. I'm gonna go spend my time on someone else, don't blow all the cash they're slipping you on atoms.
---
You got them at around 2/3 of the challenge.
---
Same.  I’ve heard all these arguments, and made many of them myself, and seen little change with how business was/is done with WoW.  Everyone wants to make money like Blizzard did so everyone is gonna copy their Online game model.  
---
Truth be told I do think the SCORE system does need a little buffer room.  I understand why they did it, but am likely going to fall victim myself as I’m too cheap to spend money.
---
At least until level 100 is that sweet X-02 armor data mined awhile back ;)
---
Can I toss an ongoing bug in here?
---
Since either Patch 17 or 18, we lost the weed-clearing aspect of foundations. They pop up through the floor and look awful. It's a small quality of life thing, but one of the patches erased the fix that had been in place and we've never gotten in back.
---
Are there any plans to re-install it? The code should already be done, just a matter of moving it from the older build to the new one I'd think.
---
I'd be ever so grateful.
---
I get it. Everyone always told me how I could get so many atoms just by playing, so I'd play my way and get 10 or less in 8 hours. You only got them if you *hunted* for them, and did that every day. I hated that. That's what this feels like too, but on both ways they gave a way out to casual players. Don't want to work for it? Buy it. Don't want to buy it? No worries, none of it is critical to gameplay. 90% is literally extra or cosmetic only. Not everyone needs to get to 100.
---
As salty as people get about buying the levels, I'm really thankful, so that if I want to build my camp for 4 hours, or miss a few days playing, I can. It was literally made for casual players to not get punished for not playing 8+ hours a day, 6-7 days a week.
---
Good point, doesn't make sense when you put it like that.
---
well lots of people needs a lecturing on how to do Ecryptid event
---
How am i already so far behind. Oh well looks like my stockpiled atoms are going to finishing it at the very end
---
I love it, being able to party up with people on a whim is great!... I just wish the game had text chat on PC... (I know there is a mod...).
---
That would be a real game changer for me personally.
---
What makes it a magic weapon? Limb damage?
---
I guess "make up for" was a bit of a stretch on my part. Again, I guess my hope is that other challenges will be added later.
---
Hard to make progress when I can only collect about 20% of my weekly challenges due to a bug not awarding when I successfully complete.  This is truly demoralizing.
---
Go visit the Lighthouse Mothman, too, lol.
---
If you are in a public team and someone is sharing strange in numbers, your stats will change.
---
PC, Bethesda Launcher
---
There's a point with FOMO where that doesn't apply and you've completely missed it.
---
Great job.
---
Rootin tootin outfit can be crafted and worn but rootin tootin hat still can’t be.
---
Nuka mines no longer injure/irradiate players outside of pvp
---
Lot of time between now and then LOL I'll take it more seriously once it's out.
---
Everything on the board is more or less cosmetic. Why do you need it all? What would that leave for the obsessive player. I play very day for multiple hours and I'm almost certain I won't get it all. And I'm just fine with that. If I really really want it I can just pay for it. And if you can't afford it (and it's dirt cheap) maybe consider less time in gaming, and more on advancing you financial situation.
---
This people problem is as old as antiquity. There are plenty of sociopaths in the world, and the world of online gaming is not exempt; in fact, it seems to attract them.
---
It's sad, and I've seen hundreds of posts like this on all the online games I've ever played, but it won't ever change, and especially not while the sociopaths are protected by anonymity.⁸
---
Very nicely done, though you might wanna thin your paints a bit, some areas are mottled which comes from a thicker layer. It’s better to apply multiple thin layers than one thick layer of paint. Yeah the job is longer cuz of it but the models look better too.
---
Pvp - Assassin 
---
PvE - vanguard
---
You know you can have fun without getting absolutely everything completed ya
---
1. I don't believe you
---
2.  Poll doesn't mean anything.  The vast majority of people who play the game don;t go on reddit or the forums or any other online discussion platform so this is meaningless.
---
3.   Nothing wrong with buying atoms.  It's because of people like me that they are able to provide all of these free updates.
---
4.  Still don't believe you.  You're probably suffering from the bug where you got the score for the challenge completion at 3 out of 5 and didn't notice and are now whining you didn't get it at 5 of 5 when you already got it.
---
5.  And none of those things are necessities.  Many of them like the fridge are actually more trouble than they are worth so don't start with that.
---
Keep being salty and demanding stuff for free.  It won't get you any further in life.
---
I have life saving and autostim armor with sneak perks and rw perks for weapons ammo and food.
---
Sounds like there are some catchup opportunities, but not as many as I would think acceptable. 
---
Maybe it's changing times and attitudes but I seriously dislike any game actively trying to make you play daily, as apposed to just rewarding total time played. With the current season people who play even 1 hour every day have it much easier and less boringly grindy than someone who plays for twice as much time, but all in one day.
---
Funnily enough, its typically veterans that ruin events for me and my group even though we're veterans ourselves. One shoting all of the legendaries (and regular enemies) inside their spawns before anyone else can get a hit on them, especially in Uranium Fever. So obnoxious. It's not like it makes the event complete faster, it only ruins it for others.
---
Heheh, yeah.
---
I was able to get mine up to 2,120 (probably because I didn't have a perk slotted earlier).  I'm only running with a couple ranks of Demolition Expert though, since I really can't justify having more than INT 5.  I also don't use Ultracite ammo with it, just the Hardened Receiver.  I've never Primed anything, actually, mostly because enough though I'm probably swimming in Ultracite, it was just "another thing to manage" that I didn't feel like doing.
---
I'm not certain, but I think it's the jetpack for the secret service armor. I can't see it behind the PA, as I can't rotate the screen, and I don't want to build it because it's a waste of resources.
---
Hey there! Can you send me a message with your platform, [bethesda.net](https://bethesda.net) name and character name?
---
Well, let's face facts here. To get the most out of your junkies build you are going to have to offset the loss of stats from being addicted, and that's going to cost you.
---
Unyielding is great for doing this, but as you know, it's costly. Personally, I would run three unyielding and two bolstering pieces, or full unyielding. 
---
Either way, you better be prepared to pay for it. The long and the short of it is, you picked the second most expensive build to run. If this is an issue, perhaps you should try a different build.
---
Off topic, but not really:  why do i sometimes find a pile of items laying around by a sbq?
---
They are piled up, not in a container.  Looks like f/o 3 when you dropped it all individually.
---
Now that i really think of it, i have found this out in the middle of nowhere, as well.
---
im at rank 7 and I don't remember watching that blue bar fill up when I completed them
---
Is it called P.O.I.N.T.S. In a specific country or something? I’ve never seen it called that?
---
"all things funneled them for free doing nothing"
---
You should be concerned about that Perception of yours with all the points you're misconstruing.
---
This is why i fully support NEVER adding text chat. I cant stand all the racism and childish evil that comes with it. I dont care to know most of you beyond an emote basis, lets just whomp ghouls together and leave it at that.
---
If you log out by 11:55 and log in at 12:05 you’re good.
---
Oh how I wish there was a reputation glitch for the settlers like there is the raiders. Ward's quest is bugged for me and completes each day without having to get the item, but it's still so unbearably slow going.
---
Dont forget to +herbivore +strange in numbers +brain fungus stew + egghead
---
I like the idea...run it as a 4-stage global event over 6 hours.  1: clear the zone for settlers, 2: establish basic structures, 3: gather resources and build advanced structures, 4: Attack the settlement - or - defend the settlement
---
That is one of the worst mentalities I've seen for defending this lmao. If you play every day for multiple hours you should most definitely be able to finish it.
---
That happens to me i sat in a bush than the last 3 just left the game.
---
I've been casually trying to respec my level 250 for...4 weeks now? Not only do you need the 15-20 levels to move around special, you have to purchase missing skills in needed slots which for me is another 10-15. I have to save up around 30 levels, which when I spend 75% of my time building will be accomplished in 2076.
---
🤡🌍
---
Either Vanguards or one of each major type of DR reduction per armor piece, 1 troubleshooters, 1 zealots, 1 goul slayers etc. I've heard that is actually better than full vanguards. 
---
Sentinel/cavalier depending on whether you prefer standing still or sprinting. 2 x Fall damage reduction is also nice with the jetpack.
---
AP refresh, weapon weight reduction, poison resist, whatever floats your boat here.
---
&gt;can you elaborate? i've been dying to resolve this problem but cannot find any specifics. thanks in advance
---
If you're melee, str should be your number one priority.
---
Or next to the truck with the radiation barrels behind the monument
---
I gave up trying to find the onsite shovel and searched high and low for one...finally found one somewhere (don't recall where) and just keep the darn thing on me for whenever I'm in the mood to do this daily.
---
I remembered it wrong I thought it was P.O.I.N.T.S. Not S.C.O.R.E. My bad
---
And I do agree with that.  I think weekends should reward double daily SCORE or something to allot for people who can’t play through the week.  I am fortunate that I work 12s, and so get more days off on average than most or I’d be SoL, but something needs to be done for the average adult player in order to retain players.
---
Oh! You typed it out that way twice so I thought maybe it was a thing. Game on, brother.
---
What are your display settings?
---
This is the right way to see it. Atom grinding was never an casual activity. And additionally, which is a point no one sees right now, Bethesda is able to give us useful items (like the ammo converter) via the SCORE system, they couldn't sell in the Atom shop because the outrage would be gigantic.
---
But you will never talk sense into some persons *shrug*
---
No trading posts allowed.
---
No, there's just some whiny shills like you that think that AAA companies deserve no backlash for putting microtransactions in paid games, nice try though.  (´ー`)y-~~
---
From what I’ve gathered, it isn’t the issue of people not getting all the rewards, but rather the fact that you need to complete ALL of the dailies and weeklies to reach 100, which is unreasonable, even for people like me who have plenty of time. Most other battle pass systems like CoD: MW and Warframe are perfectly reasonable grinds, rewarding those that stick around, but not alienating those that don’t have enough time. Heck, even Elder Scrolls: Online has a good battle pass system, so why couldn’t Bethesda do it for this game. Also, stuff like this feels like a slap to the face for those that stuck around with this game since the beginning. 
---
And your comment is very disingenuous. While I agree that there should be a grind, it should be feasible for the average joe to get it, not tedious and something that requires every second of your day. Many people are often working and don’t have time to log in every single day. So maybe it isn’t raging children, but players who genuinely care about this game, and want FO76 to be better.
---
It counts for earning levels in adventure as that worked for me yesterday
---
What no way I'm selling that bad boy I want that cap
---
I have unyielding pieces, but I'm trying to get matching armour like my bloodied (all unyielding BOS) so unsure if I want to commit to a certain type. Have some urban, forest etc... Ok, thanks for the info on pieces ratio. Looks like I'm going to trade some armour!
---
Is the game still running or does it close down after a brief moment? The game kept shutting down for my friend instantly like that and he just needed to update DirectX.
---
I don't care if you don't know how to do an event, they are sometimes difficult to figure out the specifics of, the thing that pisses me off is asshole vets bringing their fucking bloodied explosive minigun to the fucking party and destroying everything before any other player can take a shot.  Assholes can get fucked.
---
Oh
---
You’re missing the entire problem:
---
We used to get 150 atoms multiple times per week which we had the ability to choose exactly what we did or did not want to spend them on.
---
Now, we get 150 atoms a handful of times over 10 weeks, earning things we didn’t choose by doing challenges, with added pressure to use the meager atom amounts on more things that we didn’t choose and miss out on everything we had a choice to buy unless we spend real money
---
Heck yeah! From sad lil robot to mechanic delivery man!
---
Maybe for christmas give him a lil hat :)
---
I love this idea
---
No smoking, please!
---
I'm actually really tired of people throwing angry emotes out when they don't have the chance to attack the legendary on an event. HOW MANY LEGENDARY WEAPONS DO YOU WANT? There are more places to find legendaries! We can't just all want until everyone had their turn to tickle the legendary moleminer
---
I'm not an expert with bloody builds to be very honest, but I'm in a group who do know how to set it up right, including all the perk cards, bobble heads, food and mags to use. If you'd like, pm me and I'll link you with our discord.
---
This is why Fallout 1st is worth it. Private World!
---
You can still group pvp if the entire group decides to attack. No need for it to auto throw a group into pvp. Not only that, but all workshops are pvp zones still. I'm rather glad they did away with the old rules of pvp in adventure.
---
I'm waiting to do my ammo dumps u til after the game hots the x box game pass, that way it should go to mostly new players.
---
I’ve done the weeklies and the dailies every day and I’m still behind. This is unfortunate.
---
Won´t happen, youre supposed to spend atoms not play whenever you like. What do you think this is? A game? xD
---
Im 110% down for this if they find a way to implement it without it being another terminal. I already have the ammo producer, ammo converter and my daily thing.
---
Nice I said #nice
---
Lmao ft from one side of the map to the other on loop or having a fissure site sightseeing tour
---
"Lone Wanderer" is now the loneliest perk.  I used to always run it, modifying my perks on the rare occasion when someone would invite me to a team during Radiation Rumble, Paradise, or Scorched Earth.  I never run it anymore.  I join or form a team as soon as I hit the ground.  I bet many others are the same.
---
You literally just said what I quoted. It doesn’t seem hard now but it will, especially when you do an entires days worth of dailies and still not level up
---
Greetings. I'm in the US, 51yo, often play this time of the day and don't mind having a buddy to explore with. Currently lvl 203. Friend me: GT jcdbear on Xbox.
---
But seriously... When they're all standing around shooting at robots wondering why they can't kill the fake sheepsquatch instead of activating pylons it's frustrating. I agree with the no name calling though,that's just rude.
---
Honestly I don't think so. This is a filler until the next mainline Fallout, Elder Scrolls, and/or Starfield if that game lives up to the hype for me. I'll still hop on for new major updates and what not but once those games at out I'll rarely be on 76.
---
You’re not doing anything wrong, I’ve run that route many times and every so often she gets stuck in there. I had to dashboard out and restart the game to fix it.
---
Quite, they'd get bored after a while. I'd just be laughing my ass off the whole time.
---
I know what griefing is. I was griefed out of playing another game, severely. Fact of the matter is did that player that launched the nuke approach you and/or was there something that prompted it? Or was there absolutely nothing you did, no event, and were you just in an unfortunate spot? What was the location of your camp?
---
Are your voice chat settings set to area? Also your voice/chat volume should be all the way up since it seems all other sounds can drown out other players talking depending on their mics.
---
The only time I’ll send a message is if there are reoccurring legendaries (like uranium fever) and some jerk is just 1 shotting the legendaries and not letting the lower levels get a hit. Like sure, I can one shot them too, but I don’t unless I’m the only one running the event. 
---
I’ve gotten some great gear from uranium fever when I was a youngin, and other newbies deserve that too!
---
But I need more PA skins that *I'm never going to use* now that I'm OP with SS armor.
---
Completely agree.  But don't try using logic here, you'll be down voted to hell!
---
Yes, and we’ve always known that. I’m saying it doesn’t work for the repeatable weekly SCORE challenge.
---
Mine isn't bloodied, but it is a 3 star 90Wr Shovel. The 90Wr is the only one of the legendary effects I care about. I keep it on my favorites. I also use it for events like killing fireflies for the mothman event. It makes the coolest thonk noise when you hit things with it.
---
I agree, i like to see a sort of doctors chair, but with real animations like they did with the brewing bench.
---
Could be a way to remove specific mutations, cure diseases and even use it to gain some sorry of well rested equivalent that enhances disease resist
---
I tried a pistol build but even with 5 ranks of Gunslinger it still isn't viable
---
I've been using a lot of sneak perks and a Fixer lately.
---
Everyone is still using an Ultracite arm with a jetpack haha
---
The organization should be done before the start, not afterwards between insults.
---
Also hiiiiii leakybuffer! This is Inikihurricane
---
I’m rarely on 76 now as it is, the grind is a bit too long for my taste and after you finish the new content there isn’t much to do
---
I just ignored it completely when I logged on yesterday for the first time since they added it.
---
But but but that plushie in my camp will make me feel so superior to other players  WAIT GOD DAMN IT EVERYONE ELSE HAS ONE THIS ISN'T FAIR!!!
---
Yeah but you want that new SS skin so you won’t ever accidentally put it in a scrip machine
---
Stealthsuit is Great on Junkies
---
* that's what she said

so tierd of casul playrs ruinin tings :((((
---
FYI- if the one by the grave is gone, run down the hill from the cannons and you'll get to a truck with some rad barrels. There is a shovel there.
---
Great source for acid :) and a nice event to relax and do *Hero landings* on PA
---
I'd be sending a support request for that one mate. I'm assuming it's showing everythings linked in your Beth account?
---
Ps4 pro haven’t had a problem 
---
My game did get a black screen twice
---
I've heard that. I don't yet have it for my junkie. I've been farming like a....junkie farmer for legendaries lol
---
lmao i'll steer clear from it then
---
it may work, but you would have to break them while wearing them otherwise you would be weaker then a newborn baby.
---
I appreciate the idea behind the seasons but I can't help but notice the, once again, flawed excecution of them.
---
This system is, as expected by now thanks to all the other dumb daily caps, actively punishing you for not logging in and playing daily. Your options are to accept that, grind and maybe pay your way to the top OR approach it not giving a shit. I'm doing the latter as I don't see myself getting to 100 unless I grind like mad. I play to relax, not to perform tedious shit that resembles a second job you hate but do because you have to.
---
Genetic Engineering Nexus Engine.
---
Ummm...why the big deal? It respawns like all the other junk in the world. Besides, it breaks down for tasty tasty steel.
---
I encountered that for the first time not too long ago. Me and my group showed up to the event and a couple of people there kept shooting and meleeing at us. We just though "whatever" and kept doing the objective. Eventually a couple more people showed up and one of those guys one-shot the boss from the roof when it spawned, so that was fun.
---
I'll never understand seeing so many Events groups when there are no Events active on the map, it's such a waste. I always start a build group if I can't find one. I'm going to start switching it to Events. Hopefully the teammates will pick up on what I'm doing or I could try switching to Team chat and hope my message gets through.
---
Or right next to the grave on the ground.
---
Nope sorry  🤷‍♀️
---
I got the 76 insects yesterday, don't know how many atoms it was worth. I assumed it was a bug ha ha
---
A 9 year old who’s playing a game, where enemy heads, limbs and bodies (including humans) explode into a bloody heap of flesh and intestines when killing them – great job dad!
---
Yup, and I cranked em. I started trying to listen during Fasnacht, so until the parade got going not terribly noisy.
---
I quit warframe due they introducing long time requested rewards behind a battle pass type thingy, its not even monetized, but when you lose your progression cause you couldn't login for a couple of days you get discouraged and realize what's the point of doing it anymore.
---
It does have a few issues. The only one that really affected me was when you don't equip it was a scope or a RDS then the iron sights don't line up correctly.
---
HAIL [LORD SHOVE](https://imgur.com/a/OxkZZF8)!
---
I did not know that being on things prevented her from landing.
---
I’ve done it before, but I want to know if it actually would be worth it. If one shot takes more than 40% damage from me than I get no regen ability and it ends up being useless for that use.
---
I'm not all about the challenges. I don't look at the board they just happen when I play. Why is a bad mentality when I'm having fun and don't care about a grind. Or useless cosmetics.
---
It was a daft question to begin with, don't expect or demand the answer that fits your narrative.
---
I ran it for a few months, but after seeing an Angry Turtle bit on it I reallocated that point. I find it was frequently slow to switch upon death and you can do it much quicker manually. Also, I didn't like it while VATS 'run and gun' and the perk would change my direction and disorient me.
---
Yea exactly. A game. You must be a fun person to be around
---
If yall don't want to do it, then don't. Those that want to do it, can.
---
I just want the skeleton in a gibbet hanging on a tree thing, I think I can get that in 10 weeks.
---
Nope. I have this gun. It absolutely benefits from both
---
Does G.E.N.E. stand for anything or are you just trying be clever like Bethesda and just throwing out Fallouty acronyms like S.C.O.R.E. that have no explanation to what each letter stands for?
---
The very south of the divide, or the very north. Both prime locations for what you are looking for. 
---
The south has more water, but the north has more flat ground and cliffs, , but its pretty easy to find a spot with both. 
---
Also along the north of the toxic valley is pretty good, not much water that i remember, but a lot of good cliff views.
---
This makes me wonder if people would pay for a guide to help find good spots lol. I dont plan to ever move my camp, but often am wandering around and think "damn, this would be a great spot for a camp"
---
Like, if people don't want to do it then they don't have to do it. All these people are acting like it's some sort of mandatory activity
---
I dont get what it means
---
I actually had a few random people message me after doing this in our group a few times. After explaining it they added me and now I see them doing it as well.
---
The only annoying thing is when the group isn’t full you’ll see 5 or 6 public invites pop after each event lol.
---
If you had searched for 'playing cross platform' you will have seen quite a few threads about this issue.
---
Had it hit me 20 mins after the other day.

---
Bolt action can use both gunslinger and rifleman perks together so it can be a beast. I find hunting rifles to have been accuracy especially when scoped.
---
Sell DLC like ESO. Should’ve been that way the entire time. Honestly I rather they do that then every little thing gets nickeled and dimed, this doesn’t include all the limits they impose. Several currencies but Caps are still pretty worthless.
---
I have the same issuepvp was my endgame, now the setup takes longer than the pvp, noone cares anymore
---
Yup OP said he won’t be mad if it missing.. well then just don’t do season 2 lol 
---
If your at a point that you don’t care if they add it to the game then just don’t care that there in the first place
---
I dropped a nuke on Saturday and was prepping for the fight when the server froze.  I did a restart (XBox) twice since I got the dark screen of death the first time but the second time it brought me back to the same server since I was part of a team.  The downside was that it was a short fight and the SBQ was dead, the upside was that since I was part of a team I still got a reward, an axe, some water and one script.
---
Considering that the 2mm round is basically just a hunk of metal, that wouldn't make much sense at all.
---
I agree all the limits and grind suck out the enjoyment for me. I’d play again if they released the scrap box to “rent” by itself. Like 4 bucks a month or even 4.99.
---
That what so great about you , you can ignore it but occasionally you will get rewards from it
---
I ~~must be~~ am getting old, that made no sense to me.
---
Funny world? Clown world?
---
Brilliant, thank you!
---
Goddamn COMMUNIST PROPAGANDA ARGGHHHHHHHHHH
---
You could try a database rebuild, similar to defragging a pc HDD.
---
The other issue could be overheating, depending on where your console is and what it is next to.
---
Other than that it could be network issues to your PS4. Some people have seen improvements by setting up port forwarding.
---
I rename my stuff but yeah that's not good enough. It's complete bullshit that the only way to prevent stuff from being added to the list is to put a atom shop skin on it. They're literally telling us we need to spend money to protect our gear. I don't know if I'll make it that far to get the SS ghillie skin but I'll try. I'll still wear my Hunter's Long Coat.
---
Or they could add a Hunter/Hunted group type, that a person could knowingly join. You get in the group, you are flagged for PVP. Or at least put some kind of group flag that anyone joining would have to agree to, based on the team leader assigning it.
---
You can switch the team's purpose on-the-fly if you are its leader.  It's good to leave it on Building, and then as a big event like Scorched Earth winds down, switch it to Events for a few minutes.
---
nope. we need onlined. maybe we should before game menu... servers are running you know.
---
He can easily be done solo, the drops from the adds he spawns are worth more than what he drops so i usually let the fight go on a while
---
Selling DLC wouldn't work as it does in ESO, though.
---
You would have to either put quests behind a paywall, and that would just be irritating OR you would need to make completely new sections of the map that lock people out that haven't paid for DLC (i.e. the way ESO does it), and that just splits the player base up. You only have a limited number of players per server. You don't want those players spread out across multiple map instances, do you?
---
What do you propose putting in this DLC? Just a questline? Gear?
---
Cosmetics is the way to go, with free questlines added, in my opinion.
---
I've always had some frame-rate issues with this game on console but yeah it has been a lot worse since wastelanders.  I think it just runs like poop and its poorly optimized.  Have an xbox one x with Fallout 76 on an external SSD.  I'm hoping that maybe this next generation of consoles will be able to handle the frames better.
---
Yeet! That was great.
---
People forget that from launch and a while after ESO started as a similar shitshow just with a much less massive streamer backlash. Overall gamer culture is different not so much the end user experience.
---
I don't get this. I normally can't get anyone else to show up to Project Paradise. 
---
I'd be ecstatic if one other person showed up cause I mean, I can solo the event, but even if the other person is just distracting and killing the occasional mob then its still a net positive for me.
---
 Sounds pretty interesting
---
sada-tay my damie.
---
Can u also fix pvp I made a thread on how to fix pvp and I think I linked u and it got some traction. Thanks.
---
I'm not really in favor of this, it removes the concept of exclusivity to an extent. 
---
Of course anybody participating on this season have the same rewards as you do but those who don't go all the way or were simply not playing the game do not.
---
By removing the season rewards when it ends, you ensure your players who have participated in it have actually some things some other people probably will never have. 
---
Agree or not showing off is a core part of online games with customization especially MMOs.
---
If you keep them, you "devalue" those rewards.
---
When I had my Berserker I used 1 autostim, 2 lifesaving, and 2 Vanguards of random types. The only issue is I got bugged with invincible armor durability.
---
Yeah that’s what I’ve been trying to do. I started the game with friends that were hell bent on grinding and getting shit done and I fell out of love with it. Recently picked it back up and have been enjoying myself loads, I only ask because I ended up in a blast zone today and up against the legendary scorch beast thing. Had loads of fun, but obviously everyone else did way more damage than me because I’m still using reeealllly shitty weapons so I would like to improve my damage output a little
---
I have a 2shot explosive submachine gun that is only used for this. Im not built in the slightest for it, its only for tagging.
---
I use two with the same ammo type because I find I break my weapons more often than I run out of ammo. I use two Lever Action Rifles and usually carry about 4k 45 ammo on me. Once it stops showing 999. I go and make 4k more.
---
The lake a little bit above the back bear on the map in the southeast one liberator mob shows once in awhile and never other players or enemies
---
So you just replied to a comment you don't even understand with the first deflective statement that came to mind.
---
I might just be my phone but the guy and me spoke about it yesterday but the convo is gone. He said there is a certain stock that courses it.
---
OK, that's bullshit then - so we *again* have a couple of things that aren't worth the effort... well, at least it saves me gold... -.-
---
I've never set one up, but can you basically store them in vending machines?
---
Nice story✌🏻
---
nah mate brand new ps4 here and the game play like ass, is the fuckin lights and animations bugged to the core, this game would be so awesome if they fix those frame drops.
---
oh and the UI too, I test it I turned off and hell the game had a small improvement in stability but is not playable without HUD.
---
Exactly. You get enough free atoms in the easier levels to buy the last 10 hardest levels
---
And you are right! For T65, it works :D
---
I’m not too far off of exactly what you had. I also have some vamps FFR stuff so I could always use that when I’m in a bad spot.
---
Exactly as ESO imo that was the point. Create new lands for us to explore, weapons, armors. ESO is incredibly popular, so it can work. Problem is that Beth does not want to put time into this game. 
---
It honestly saddens me how they keep fumbling up this game. 
---
They keep treating it like it’s single player. Almost exactly like F4.
---
I’m not positive on the perks thing, but something definitely seems fishy.
---
my daymi, cole me on the pannie sty
---
Yeah. I even made a point to unlink and relink it just to be sure
---
I agree.
---
Fo76 doesn't feel like a regular MMORPG. Its something i havnt played before (and seen but im not an expert so what do i know) putting things behind a DLC wont work and only will alienate allot of people. Now they can do that down the line (Like Far harbor, Old World Blues and Broken steel) but i rahter they stick to the free updates and cosmetic/subscription model. 
---
IF they make F1 more appealing in terms of cosmetics and ONLY keep the cosmetics. I don't want to see scrips, or any of that in the shop. The repair kits already where a shot in my left manlybits
---
And you can add those on arm too... here we go again with the "jetpack on leg/arm" bug... :D
---
Creating new lands to explore would make it even more like a solo experience. I don't see why this couldn't be given for free and supported by cosmetics, just like right now. Wastelanders was a pretty big addition to the game, wasn't it?
---
The game is meant to play similar to as if it were single player. The point is that there are not meant to be that many people milling about. You are repopulating.
---
You might have a stronger case if you didn’t make ridiculous claims like completing all the daily challenges in a few minutes. Well, unless you count them being auto completed, of course.
---
Regular armor or PA?
---
I sell all my ammo except fusion cores and plasma cores for 1c. Fusion cores I sell for 100 and plasma cores I sell for 25. I sell everything except missiles and nukes because they weigh to much, but even grenades sell. I also don't sell my Alien Blaster ammo since I can only get about 15 per day.
---
&gt;3: Rewards are pretty much ‘shit’ IMO
---
On the other hand, all the rewards I want are probably within the first 40 levels or so.
---
It's actually quite a slog from there to the end because it's skins for weapons I never use, more of that same PA, more PA I'll never use, more of that Ghillie crap.  Until the very end.
---
And even then, the rewards I've gotten so far really haven't impressed me at all.  The Ammo Converter is a joke.  The Ghillie stuff looks like someone taped pom-pom plastic onto the side of your armor.  The glow-in-the-dark stars wallpaper looks stupid in the daytime.  I've no use for Power Armor skins.  None of it is really that inspiring enough to give me FOMO, to be honest.
---
Yeah, I only level up every 2 or 3 days as it stands, sometimes just once a week, because I'm just not good at combat. Mind you, I'm on for 1-3 hours a day, every single day. Levelling is the hardest thing around.
---
There's a couple of situations where the need the advice, solicited or not because if they don't do it a certain way they will blow it for everyone.  Starting radiation rumble or project paradise before enough people are there comes to mind.
---
I think I got that code last time they had server login issues, but it might have been a slightly different one. 
---
Everything appears to be normal that I can see, so yeah support request for sure.
---
That typically means you haven’t done and intermediate step or something else she wants you to do.
---
Check you data tab and scroll through the various mission types.  You may have the required action notice turned off.
---
The F4 version of the gauss rifle we have in 76 follows the design of the M72 Gauss that appeared in Fallout 2, it ejected a 2mm magazine when depleted.
---
The one that appeared in Operation Anchorage and then New Vegas operated on the principle you're describing, it had an onboard clip and fusion cells were needed to power the rail. It reappeared in 4 as a creation club item.
---
That doesn't really make any sense. You made a statement ,but don't know about what you said?
---
Its been talked about since the early days of 76. 
---
Ideas of high scores on the machine so players can see who is the best nuka tapper, it costing 1-4 caps to play that goes to the camp owner. Having it be just one machine that the camp owner loads a hole tape game into to decide what game would be played.
---
All great ideas, but we will most likely never see it sadly.
---
Is your client up to date as well?
---
I logged in to do some dailies today.  I had to log out in disgust because the game absolutely refused to let me fast travel.
---
I find I have to go into the Pip-Boy under Data and toggle the quest as active to see anything with circles. It doesn't show a black or yellow diamond on the map. (Along with the Hordes, Vital Equipment, and the Vox Interpreter quest.)
---
I have it’s non-Bloodied cousin, a Furious WR shovel.
---
Does your comment have any relevance to the actual point of the post, or are you just criticising one tiny aspect for the sake of being a nuisance?
---
Can you send me a message with your [bethesda.net](https://bethesda.net) name, character name and platform?
---
Start a new character &gt; get the score point &gt; delete character and repeat each time you get that challenge
---
What doesn’t make sense that it’s basically a rail gun and it’s a sliver of metal that shoots with magnets .
---
Energy weapons don’t exist with ammo in the form of a fusion core.  why can’t you pack 200+ pieces of metal in a huge cartridge it can’t be any bigger than 50 cal ammo lol?
---
The way ESO works is that the quests and a zone is behind a paywall. You can't teleport to the zone unless you pay for the DLC.
---
However, the vast majority of the gear that you pick up there can be sold to people without the DLC.
---
I can see it sort-of working with Fallout 76, but I think there are just far too few players per server for it to work. Plus, the constant loads to enter new zones, get back to your camp etc. would just be cumbersome.
---
I have an unreasonable dislike for bloodied and unyielding builds because of it. I scrap any i find right away.

I still don't understand how people don't constantly die in the sheepsquatch event. I accidentally walked into the event recently while exploring and died repeatedly while trying to take out some robots. 
---
I set my player icon to blowing bubbles so maybe ppl would know I'm a casual player just trying to collect ingredients and goof off. The only time I'm getting off on shooting things is when I'm blowing up a parking lot of cars. 
---
So pretty.
---
And sleeping with ur ally
---
Ah ok thanks
---
Gotcha, nicknames like that are the best.  Well, there *is* a "Mangy Moose" steakhouse hidden in a quiet town in Yellowstone.  Wondrous place, the park and the restaurant.
---
Does it regenerate as fast as Healing Factor does out of combat?  Could be interesting.
---
Breaking armor is too much of a pain in the ass for me though, I prefer using lvl 1 legendaries with Med X/Psycho addictions.   Kinda a pain to get, but much easier in the long run, imo.
---
green thumb for glow sight 1 for radiation rumble is the only one i change.
---
18 but the second day my most of the dailies autocomplete :///
---
Maybe I should try playing ESO again at this rate
---
I keep a Junkie Shovel as my back-up weapon just for that mission and Path to Enlightenment.  Plus, I love the sound it makes when you hit those bugs.
---
All feel free to add KnoxVegasVol, just hit level 113 and grinding the daillies and still exploring.
---
As we are seeing, cosmetics are pretty much everything now. 
---
As I feared many of the New outfits that are seen on NPCs are only available through Atom shop. 
---
They’re cutting content to add to the shop and then overselling it when we can all jus today like 10-20 bucks and bam! Have everything. Wastelanders id pay for even at 20. 
---
By single player, I mean how content isn’t occurring on a regular basis, when it does drop it’s mainly awful with bugs and grind. Wastelanders so far has been the only content worth the wait. 
---
Fixing bugs should be a weekly process. Updates need to be rolled much more than how it is.
---
it is for sprinting, you cant kill fast enough if you take too much time to reach your target plus the Perk(The one that increases your Dr wile you run) helps a lot.
---
Why Do You Write Like This? It'S Hard To Read And A Pointless Effort.
---
Aaah, thanks. Now you mention it, I do remember a couple of times when the counter randomly went up, that must have happened with a couple of the challenges!
---
Logout now! Or the fanboys will say it is your fault you lost score.
---
Shit..... that's like day 5 in a row for me now...
---
I knew I forget something.
---
Yes I’ve been told. Never been myself. It’s on the bucket list.
---
Maybe if they "Added zones" like with Far Harbor DLC like an island or a crator. Something along those lines.
---
Put that map on a different server with the ability to jump between that place and people playing the dlc and the normal world.
---
Yes you got the idea just remember to save some lunchboxes for double xp weekend to get the most bang for your time
---
That’s a good idea, I’m going to start running glowing, too. Usually I just drop lone wander in teams and put on strange in numbers and  tenderizer. 
---
I occasionally put on revenant since I’m bloodied and let myself get picked up by a teammate for the extra damage.
---
Unfortunately not an option for me. While I have a high Int, it's a normal character Int … I don't run a bloody build or mutations, and killing a high level super mutant is a huge bit of work, usually taking two or three clips of ammo and netting a tiny fraction of that 1K hurr hurr hurr thing.
---
It takes me days to level up. It's a *huge* struggle over here in normal land.
---
Have you tried No Man's Sky in its current iteration? Much improved from launch, with online multiplayer and I THINK... cross-platform multiplayer support?
---
Storyline quests + repeatable content as you travel around the world trying to unravel a mystery.. You can upgrade your storage, replace and mod your multi-tool (essentially a gun that mines for you too), build bases, fly spaceships, and also raise a living spaceship (I've not returned for that update, but the designs on the living ships are cool).
---
Ah! Found the newsbit on cross-plat MP capability:  [https://www.nomanssky.com/2020/06/introducing-crossplay-for-no-mans-sky/?cli\_action=1594051310.03](https://www.nomanssky.com/2020/06/introducing-crossplay-for-no-mans-sky/?cli_action=1594051310.03) 
---
Cheers.
---
Yeah, dumb idea tbh
---
I disagree with what people are saying about tse being nerfed.
---
I use a tse lever action rifle.  I turned damage numbers on and I can one shot a level 68 super mutant master.  The numbers say that each shot does 190 plus damage.   
---
Yeah,  the accuracy isn't the best as each shot goes in a slightly different place,  but the damage numbers are definitely both very similar.  If it was only 25% increase or whatever then the second shot would only do like 40 summit damage.  
---
I'd screenshot but I'm not that quick at taking screenshots.  
---
Unless I bought a legacy lever off someone?
---
I don't have a build optimized to take damage, but I have no problem taking at least one pylon and popping Stimpaks to heal myself.
---
It's no skin off my nose. I'm not going to play every day and I'm not going to buy levels, so I don't mind the opportunity to unlock things through game play.
---
Do you guys use mics with strangers? Maybe I'm just old and cynical but I will not use my mic unless I get the vibe they're good people and am quick to hit the block button. Not worth the headache IMO.
---
What does it mean and does it apply to this situation
---
Mole Miners are a type crypted. Not in Fallout 76 but in West Virginia in real life. They stroke mines with powerful firearms and kill miners when they dig into their tunnels. From my understanding they have overly muffled voices too.
---
I think that is way she doesn't talk and sells legendary weapons.
---
You have to either get the Nuclear Winter one or the Level up one.
---
Two bad options for me.
---
That's interesting, people will have more maths to do now.
---
The SBQ has an outright 70% damage reduction on her, before her armor is taken into account too, so it shouldn't be surprising that your 1,600 weapon is only doing 350 against her.
---
Bloodieds hit harder, but you should have no trouble getting credit for the Queen and then some, so I wouldn't be concerned about not "pulling your weight."  With so many damn hacked weapons these days, it's actually tough to be a Bloodied melee because people can kill her without even needing her to land anymore.
---
Chances are if they're playing, they're not looking at Reddit. Those who don't know by now, can't be saved but they'll be here shortly with the hundredth post this week on the topic instead of searching for the answer themselves.
---
It's been like that the whole time.
---
O well lol
---
You sure? Mine has only ever been 250 for the level up.
---
Usually I switch out my stealth perks for Gun Fu and a higher ranked adrenaline.  But with that broken I don't even bother sometimes now.
---
Not sure why you are responding to my thread 4 months later, but RMT is against their TOS and there have been bans because of it. 
---
I can kind of see your point, but you are also overlooking the type of player who just pays to win and in this case with real money is more likely to get bored faster because they will have less things to do. 
---
Of course a similar argument was made against my case, but the reason I suggested a rework is that the pool is so large.
---
Fortunately the Wastelanders update offered a compromise by singling out some of the best equipment you can currently through crafting.
---
Just had a hacker today running through the air 1 shooting everyone. Has quite alot of people spectating him
---
I'm c4_
---
No i doubt it will make it to 3
---
The game was rigged from the start
---
Cool. Thanks.
---
Yea spend free atoms that the run gives you no money required how is this a bad thing 
---
Yall people are ridiculous I post somthing to be helpful and yall just shit all over it no wonder Bethesda doesn't listen to your suggestions cuz no matter what they do yall just want something to complain about
---
I literally jumped back into 76 with Wastelanders specifically because of how bad Destiny 2 got with the grind around Season of the Worthy. 
---
Now, grinding D2’s seasons seems so generous considering ANY xD contributes to the pass, compares to the (limited) SCORE challenges that feel like they’re meant to keep us getting on the game everyday. 
---
Just let us play how we want to. ;c
---
I always thought they are like burned miners wich melted into their suits.
---
Are you looting?!? Robots drop lead , scrap weapon for steels etc etc you should be able to craft ammo , also loot ammo even if you don’t use them and convert them with the new thing
---
You are right. Just like the gold 50cal would not go on action hero before.
---
I'd just at least be happy if we could keep "account wide" unlocks available cross platform.
---
I'd like to have a break in between them, at any rate.
---
Indeed. I’m hoping someone finds one. It also doesn’t help that raiders have both the crater and the mirelirk quests that can be done daily.
---
&gt;  Pylons constantly drain your health
---
I've cleared the event maybe 5-6 times and I just realized this lol. Maybe I didn't read closely enough but it was not clear at all and I thought the Sheepsquanch was just attacking me.
---
I have tested this out with some friends and it appears that explosive bait will only cause a player to be staggered, but doesn’t do any damage if you’re not engaged in pvp. Explosive bait will still damage things in people’s camps however.
---
My kind of fun, I'd have to join in if I saw that.
---
Don’t sell for zero because somebody ganna buy them all up and resell for 1 cap
---
I forgot to do the kill 10 molemen daily...so I rushed to get it. Got the 10th kill and dashboarded at 11:59. Thought I was safe. Got on at 12:01 and I have 5/7 completed =/
---
do you have sure is the repeatable one? and not the lvl up once rewarded?
---
I can't remember what it was last Tuesday, but it was definitely 500 yesterday too.
---
"Oh, it's you. How do you like it this time: with or without vaseline?"
---
im gonna set up a little shop with level one gear outside the vault gonna be all types of fun i think
---
I do the same. I'm really hoping that the ammo converter doesn't effect ammo sales too much. I just buy off other people when I'm low.
---
it's always been 500.
---
Friendly fire gets swapped in for a number of events where I can use a shishkebab to heal. Refractor for Encryptid. Enforcer for rad rumble depending on how many people are there (to cripple of there aren't enough heavy hitters). And there are a handful of perks I swap out for queen fights to maximize damage where I have convenience perks the rest of the time.
---
How do you get it to explode? I tried on a trap camp once and they all just sat there, couldn't detonate them by shooting them or VATSing onto them.
---
Got to be level 25 or higher for them to appear i believe
---
 [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Plan:\_Lever\_gun](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Plan:_Lever_gun) 
---
You on xbox?
---
I’ll look into that perk. I run a bloodied build too.
---
Bought mine from the vendor in Watoga.
---
It's been 500 every day of the event.
---
You can unlock that ammo converter in one day. If someone hasn’t managed to do that then they probably don’t even play the game anymore.
---
I prefer to stay off mic and Mr. Bean my way through the game, leaving a wake of confused frustration around me. In seriousness, there’s only so much I can do to pull my punches in an event to make lower levels happy. There are some events I haven’t memorized yet so I make mistakes. I’m trying very hard to be the guy helping the event to succeed. I do what I can to help the team in the situation. If that breeds contempt, maybe that says more about the rage-aholics than it does me.
---
That might the idea behind their design. But miner don't wear much, there's a lot of pictures of miners shirtless due to the heat and how sweaty they get.
---
The vendors in Whitesprings sel them too so that will save you some caps. 
---
That said, you need to be level 25 before they show up in any of the vendors.
---
Would love this, but something tells me they’re banking on people needing to pay to get the end of season rewards.
---
Advice and education in a friendly way, yes absolutely.   
---
The problem is the toxicity of veteran players calling names to those who don't perform like them.
---
Do you have to be level 25+ for them to have a. Hence to show up in the “wild”
---
Unfortunately, I've lost score 2 days in a row, second one while I was logged out. This doesn't necessarily seem to be the solution.
---
This, you should give it another chance when it's busy.
---
I tested it with a team member but I’m 95% sure we are good to go with the scavengers. I’ve always healed them with the Shiskebab. I’ll test the flamer without Napalm the next time Radiation Rumble pops up.
---
I’m new, is there a guide for each event? I going to be popping into this game from time to time, but not everyday.
---
Awesome. I’ll look into a few of those. Friendly friendly is one I keep forgetting to take. I got dump some save points in that one now.
---
I'm away till the 11th, genuinely afraid I'm gonna miss out on a lot and not be able to catch up because I just won't have enough time to play :'(
---
Because the points are awards before you completed them.
---
much in the way you wouldn't point and call them 'those two scums' irl?
---
I believe bethesda programmers are so used to moders fix things they lost the touch to the engine and start to have bad habit's of not checking to the fullest what they did.
---
It appears to be somehow related to this latest update. There were occasional issues with framerates before but since patch 20 it's all gone to hell. For me building is absolutely miserable and blue screen crashes happen at least once a day. 
---
The worst part about it is it seems to persist after quitting the game. Several times I've tried to switch games after playing 76 and had my system slow to a crawl and needed to restart to fix it.
---
Im xbox,  so maybe different systems are different
---
I'm level 189 and an exploding car or dumbass exploding idiot legendary asshole robot wrecks me. I guess bloodies are stocked with dmg reduction perks for explosions and everything...
---
It stands for "Feeding Our Mistermyxl Observations", and it's something I won't be doing given the track record of this conversation.
---
Have a blessed one.
---
I was lvl 27 headed to the top of the world. All of a sudden here comes a lvl 45 sheep sqautch. I had a pa frame on and several shot guns. It killed several mole miners it was fighting and turned on me. I hid in a broken bus nearby and threw every grenade i had at it. Broke 7 shot guns ( looted some off mole miners) and eventually just punched it repeatedly. Went through so many stimpacks and aid items but i killed that tough SOB but he never killed me. Was one of my proudest achievements lol
---
Never knew this, thanks!
---
Yes, I'm pretty sure you do.
---
Use psychotats
---
Currently been sat for half hour wondering when to login.  I'm giving it a good 15 minutes.
---
I worry that if I have one session bugged out then I'll just not bother at all.  There is no margin for error in this run.  One slip can literally cost real life money buying atoms to level.
---
What is the perceived best way to run that then, wait until the last possible second before finishing the music? 
---
Last time I was there and that happened, we failed the event as no-one else helped with the music at the end. Killed a lot of ghouls though.
---
First off he's 9, so you can't him to learn and absorb every bit of information in it's entirety. Secondly, his dad is helping him and teaching him how to play, no human being comes into this world without being given handouts to survive so your statement while true to an extent is flawed. Lastly, just let this be a good thing, there's too much negativity in the world as is and you in essence accusing him off karma whoring doesn't make anyones day better.
---
I just hit Watoga HS and Morgantown HS.  Never thought I’d play a video game where I’m busing tables and cleaning up cafeterias and gymnasiums.
---
Chillitats XD
---
I played the event near release, it was super fun when everyone only uses the black powder weapons.
---
Becomes very unfun when someone with power armor and a gatling laser would stroll along. Which was basically any random player you came across. When it was just my 3 friends and I it was a great event.
---
Yes those people need to go.
---
this is what cryo grenades are good for
---
tags them all and makes it easy for everyone, it's a crowd pleaser too
---
What's FOMO?
---
Sorry, i call BS. I'm in a comparable argument over at the Steam forums, and the whining there is the same. But there are some players, that already earned the same amount of Score you can get through challenges (daily and weekly) with the repeatable XP challenge. And then there's the double Score weekend in August. And maybe we will even get direct Score through events in the near future. There are even people who finished the board (even if i guess that there is an amount of XP exploiting involved).
---
Mark my words. Every hardcore player will reach stage 100 way before the season ends. Players like me, who are "only" playing 2-4 hours a day will have no problems with reaching stage 100. And even casual players will get to at least stage 50 in the season.
---
But i guess, that is where our opinions diverge. You think of a season pass as something every person should finish with ease (which makes no sense), and i see it as additional rewards while playing. WoT has introduced a free season pass, too, and no, casual players won't see the end there, too.
---
So, the problem is with your mindmap, that you think every person should get all the rewards, without any effort. If this is the intention of a season pass, why make all the fuss, you could give all those rewards to every player without anything. in my opinion, not every average joe should be feasible to get, because that would dilute the later rewards for the players that earned it. The more i think about it, the more absurd i find this idea. Why would you introduce those challenges when you want everyone to get everthing? 
---
Anyway, my point stands, people whining over the current system are either uninformed or have no feeling for proportionality. Every person with some common sense should have no problem seeing the advantages of this system over the old Atom grind.
---
It was 40. From what I can tell, all of the new ones were 40.
---
Same thing happened to me today. 4 of them were done already. Honestly deflated my vibe on this. I can't be excited to log on every day if the goals I have going in are bugged.
---
Ah. Ok. Thanks. Two more levels then
---
Exactly lol, the game has 3 layers of monetization, while people are comparing the system to f2p games.
---
I think In the fallout universe they are heavy mining suits meant to be protective, and they just got trapped and went “feral”
---
Thanks is for this!!
---
You sound like a miserable fuck.
---
yea sure i could take a look at that list
---
Where is this?  I’ve heard of it but haven’t been there yet.
---
Good. The more its posted, the more pressure on Bethesda to fix it.
---
Huh
---
yes, clearly you were being an asshat, and not a fuckface
---
Turn off music, pip-boy and world radio, lower Depth of Field, set comms to Team. I also turned off 'Misc Quest Active when started' and Power Armor HUD. Try not to have any other applications running. Try and play from a fresh start up, rather than from Rest Mode.
---
All of that helped me a lot.
---
It is a bug, you got the score. Just it happened before the challenges completed.
---
It's happened to everyone.
---
I highly doubt that is what it means
---
Haven't done it as berserker, but solar armor is nice for a full health build. Unless you're fighting something with really high damage like a Mr Gutsy or Supermutant with minigun, it alleviates the need to use stim packs to top off your health. It's also much more bearable to roll than secret service because you always get 3 star.
---
We had a group of vertibots take down all of our enemies at lower levels. This was great. If I'm in a low level area and looking for a keycard, I mostly leave the Vertibots alone, for them to help lower level players.
---
Seasons has combined with team mechanic has made more people more active.  I see more people at events. This season has given people something to aim for besides that perfect weapon or armor drop. Im going on 1600 hours and have been playing sense beta. The time constraint does suck and it is a grind but over all it is a positive change in my opinion.
---
I like that idea, since I won’t be login every day it well help me at least finish some of them at my own pace.
---
Suppose that depends on how hard you chill and how hard thwy try.
---
I have   question about that perk, it's only for ranged? its not very clear besides the picture
---
There is one thing, though - crafting the full suit and a suit of either thorn or solar minus the mask gives you the vault 94 player icon, so there is that at least.
---
omg Ur RaiSinG a SchOoL ShoOteR! hE iS gIvIng AwaY ComMIe WaTeR tOO!!!!
---
Had it happen 2 days. I'm scared to log in and see them gone today again because it's extremely discouraging.
---
No. Because the auto complete issue has been around since NW has come out. Just be sure to log into adventure mode first and/or make sure you arent in NW when the challenges reset.
---
Look at dead by daylights archive this is very similar to that, they have a rift which is another part that does disappear after time but the archive stays, they have the current one on the main page then a second page where you can access all the previous one called the compendium, honestly that would be great because time restraints don't go well for me but I don't see it ever happening

I also have any Junk you might need including flux.  Let me know what you think! Thanks for looking!
---
No, because I always log out before the reset for dailies happens which has been thus far the trigger for it happening
---
It works really in rad rumble, free range, project paradise and riding shotgun. It also works in a couple others but isn't really needed.
---
From testing explosive bait seems really hit or miss, sometimes it goes off almost as soon as it's thrown, other times I've thrown 10 and none have gone off. Seems like it might be server dependant. You can only force it to go off if it doesn't on it's own by having an animal attack it. We usually use mole rats to test it out. Just have your person stand by the mole rat, throw the bait and the mole rat will attack the bait and cause it to explode.
---
No. I’m on PS4 and yeah thanks for the info. Just need two more levels. Hahahaha.
---
I’m a rifle build and it works for me. The pick does show a gun, but the text just says more damage and doesn’t indicate ranged or melee. I’d say try one level and see what happens. But I think it’ll work.
---
Possibly, all things considered that would make sense. Be cool if they had a dlc based around them.
---
And maxing out int stat while double dipping unyielding buffs.
---
I remember when I first started and was low on water and I just asked some dude for water and he gave me 60. If someone comes up to me I'll hook them up (Even it goes against my characters nature as he is kind of a dick, I do try to RP on there a little)
---
I saw some level 7 way out of their league and set up a tent near him and rezzed him. I think he was confused, like I was going to kill him? Cause he took off and kept looking back at me haha.
---
Would be. If you listen closely sometimes what they say makes sense and it’s chilling
---
Usually when I start free range I remember I should have taken it.
---
Im going out of the box here and say weightless for 2 reasons.
---
- SS gear is ppretty much OP in the base stats, and this game scales everything when you reach certain number (250DR per instance), so when you piling up a lot of 35DR for each piece of vang. you not gaining a lot of actual defense in return.
---
- Weigthless makes you very light (ofc) since SS with jetpack and butressed can weight a lot and you wont need a chameleon piece.
---
Thats what i use and its pretty much extremely hard to die with those stats.
---
Its definitely got worse in the last few weeks for me. Very often I get to an area and have to wait about 20-30 seconds for everything to load. Especially the case when I fast travel to Crater. Looks like the Raiders have packed up and left.
---
Hmmm what platform are you on? I think if it’s just your Bethesda account name you can login to that account on a computer and do it from there, but I have never had to do it so it’s just a guess. If all else fails you can submit a ticket to Bethesda.
---
I don't think so mate no, as far as I know it uses your Bethesda username. At least my character is my username.
---
I try it it melee for a long play session did not notice the perk activating, did not knew he was supos to, will try again and let you guys know
---
This story doesnt add up at all. Im calling it a fake story for karma attention by a salty player.
---
Hold up, berserker works with broken armour? and you still get the legendary effects of said armour?
---
Great job, Dad.
---
SIMP
---
I agree with you 100%
---
That's the only reason I am working towards it. That way even if I can't kill a high level I can still show off the fact that I'm better then them with my ghillie secret service armor.
---
Faster. With a vamps weapon you are borderline unkillable. I believe it’s 4hp/sec.
---
Out of all the enemies they could bring back, watch it be the cazadors....
---
She has fucked me so much with her three star legendary dildo, that I won't be stepping inside that house ever again.
---
Thanks for sharing. I cannot believe they posted that response 4 days ago and still have not updated the website. That website was up for a couple weeks before the season even started. Clearly it was originally supposed to include public events and a change or something was made at the last minute. 
---
Man their communications and PR are terrible...
---
I’m on PC
---
Maybe I like giving myself a hard time, but I’ve always felt like wearing armor — broken or no — is kind of cheating with Berserker. Mine usually wears the Hooded Rags since she’s the only character of mine who *can* lol.
---
Tagging every single mob is fucking insane, even more so because Mole Miners barely give any XP. But I gotta admit when people kill the Supervisors without letting everyone get a tag that it pisses me off.
---
“It drives more and more players away from the game”
---
You gonna cite that or are you just talking out of your ass?
---
It is happening also on adventure mode not only NW.
---
One of my favorite things to do in this game is to help out low level players. I had my fair share of things dropped to me when I was low level, so it’s only fair to return the favor!
---
I not understood anything they said. But it is still chilling to me
---
You don't even know what that means
---
Yeah, get the meter up most of the way and then turn the jukebox off. Then with about 2-3 minutes left on the timer, turn it back on so it completes and you get a screami boi that someone's going to one-shot anyway.
---
Or don't, this post is all about not lecturing people.
---
It’s the cheater way, but yes. (Not really cheating just not using as intended. )
---
Mate, for example in one post, like another * i have 40 children's and cant play* Topic starter said he dont want to play every day, cuz he want to play another games, fine with that. But is he deserves max rewards not wanting to play, not enjoying the game? I don think so. I think most frustration and whine we have, all comes because of 4 times lower atoms rewarded, people feel scammed or something. But i see it as a reward to players during 2 years of beta test, before wastelanders
---
Amen to that!
---
Best way to do encrypted event, get a full set of any armor with the troubleshooters effect. And either a shotgun or fast firing weapon with vampires effect.
---
Put the blocker strength perk, and fireproof endurance perk on and hit one pylon. Then get up in the sheepsquatchs face and start unloading. Doesn't matter if she's shielded, the vampire effect will still proc. This will allow the other players to hopefully get the idea and hit the other 2 pylons. And it'll keep the aggro on you the whole time so no one else gets melted. 
---
Then it's just gunning her down without any issues. I recently spent 17k caps buying some 13 recall cards and did the events all this way. You don't even need any stimpack with a good vampire weapon.
---
Have you tried closing and relaunching the game?
---
True but by this point it should be stickied so it's the first thing people see so they're informed about it faster.
---
Any of the rifle stocks will do it on the bolt action and on the pipe revolver. It does not work on the pipe pistol / pipe rifle.
---
It's easier than stimpacks or kill 3 creatures.  Just channel your inner bush wookie and become one with the fauna!
---
This sounds a lot like the Big Mtn. Auto-Doc from New Vegas, which I would absolutely love to have in my camp.
---
Damn, I thought I was doing good at level 17 LOLOLOL
---
The raider waster bundle comes with the salute emote, yes.
---
I owned the Raider Scabber bundle, and got the emote from purchasing the Raider Waster bundle. So it is either from the Waster bundle, or from having both. It is not from the real-money Raider bundle, though. That's the best I can do for you 🤷‍♂️
---
I think it's to do with people giving out to others and then getting discouraged
---
Yea I would try logging into your Bethesda account and going into settings to see if you can change it from there. Could be a visual bug though idk cause I’m on PS4. Hope you can figure it out though!
---
Not to my knowledge, I bought the double pack and didn’t get any new emotes.
---
Can you explain what the significance of that would be? I’m not familiar with the Solar Armor.
---
does it go on it now?
---
Going to be a couple double score events and if there and will be double XP it will be very easy to do. Y'all keep looking at it like you can only do the challenges then that's it. It's not
---
flora not fauna.
---
It’s been 4 days. Why is the FAQ still not updated?
---
It gives you score when you reach 3/5
---
Maybe they are working on the issue of them not resetting properly which has caused a delay in their reset time.
---
What!?! Lol
---
Now son that sounds a lot like communism! /s
---
Also I looked back and people were still having this problem a year ago. When you have to play basically seven days a week to not have to worry about missing the sweet rewards at the end (without having to spend a crazy amount of money) these barriers should have been fixed. and this is a 10 week thing, I'm willing to bet somewhere along the way everyone will have a bugged log in or have to miss a day, and level 100 will be unreachable unless they are putting in crazy hours xp grinding.
---
It's much bigger, in fact. To get some perspective on just how big the slugs are, do some research on real life Gauss guns.
---
Yup, I had the same realization. I noticed I was getting random SCORE boosts and thought, I won’t complain I guess. Then I saw someone comment about that bug on here and I tested it on my next weekly to find out that yup that’s the problem.
---
There's a last in watoga station that likes robots
---
I mean with work and there being limited amounts of ways to earn score I’m going to buy my ranks and hope season 2 is a little more gratifying
---
Yeah I was in adventure
---
I think i might be one too, as im constantly enterning my power armor :/
---
I just got into the game and looked at it. It is a Junkies, 40% faster swing speed, 90% reduced weight shovel.
---
And people have said they've been offline for two hours before the reset and it still auto completes some...
---
Oh...3 weeklys?
---
Or mini-weeklys?
---
Was in adventure
---
Grim reapers sprint would work. However, on a melee build, you should be focusing on str first, then endurance. You'll have AP to spare.
---
It still took less time then the gain an overseer level. But I prefer the others they have given. Using stims, Killing animals and deploying camp can all be done in one match generally.
---
weekly already reseted?
---
In NW please as well.  I would grind alot more if they did.
---
I still have mine, been meaning to display it when I get more furniture for my robot factory
---
Dammit! I knew I mixed it up.
---
Yeet
---
Gotcha, I usually just follow the objectives when running events, I can see why people like to grind EXP though, meh whatever floats your boat as far as I'm concerned.
---
It's a cumulative count.... just play 2-3 matches and you should be good
---
If your perception is high enough, you can deduct that she REALLY REALLY loves them long time, and she admits it.
---
Here's original. I'm almost level 100 ive done zero questlines. I have a full game to play stilI and my team have solely helped one another and others. Game is awesome when youre altruistic. You're just a sad lonely troll. *ad Victoriam*
---
How's that for originality.
---
I'll go check it out today lol
---
So I had mine checked off but you can still complete them
---
*stops majestic galloping* 
---
Ah yes, flora, of course
---
yes yes, I have 24 ate so far, not planing on be low how build tho, with all bug and thing I have up to 430 only on damage
---
I was just coming in to ask...
---
Oh yeah, in 30 mins you could get an Event team fully bonded and do the SBQ and Encryptid. Pop some XP boosting food, well-rested, maybe open a Lunchbox and you're laughing.
---
Eh? Mine hasn't...
---
My wife and I both picked up a year subscription when wastelanders dropped and I have no regrets. The scrap box and survival tent alone are worth the $8.50 a month it averages to. That extra, free spawn point combined with access to your scrap and stash box almost anywhere on the map is a godsend. I'll drop my tent outside of a town or larger building and spend an hour or so running in and out grabbing everything I can for scrap or to sell for caps. 
---
Out of all the 1st perks the private lobby is the one we use the least. Private servers are nice for gathering since you won't go to a location and find all the phones and globes and hot plates and weights missing but being player vendor junkies we spend most of our time in public lobbies. 
---
The atoms are nice too; $16 a month in atoms for $8 is a hell of a deal. 
---
Basically it boils down to how much of a hoarder you are
---
Awesome! Happy hunting
---
If you can get your paws on a TSE laser rifle you are set but other than a few rare TSE guns its bloodied first, junkie second for meta. And auto rifles for gun meta.
---
Her name is maram ayari
---
I had to AFK the last one while doing other stuff. The absolute best part was that it shorted me every time. Time survived per death screen 8:41, but score challenge gave me credit for 6 minutes so I had to scuba dive 5 matches instead of just 4. Also you need 1-4 minutes of wasted time just getting to the next match which is kind of ridiculous in its self. 
---
Yep I'll be spending atoms to reach the final ranks just to make up for lost NW ones. :(
---
Kill 3 creatures is easy if you know where they spawn
---
Can't you just visit a single Encrypid event?
---
Are they Mr.Fuzzy tokens? I thought they were just “Claim Tokens” which are different and useless.
---
I have them on Xbox
---
Those just say token , not fuzzy token
---
When they get like that, I ask them if they've ever seen actual combat. It usually shuts the desk-jockey up pretty quick.
---
Interesting. There's a lot of different options I suppose. I need to find a balance, but have all the same type as in forest or urban or leather etc.
---
Never look into the pipe revolver. But I can say then I never seen for me on bolt action. Though knowing 76, it could be I'm getting a display glitch and it actually is doing more damage.
---
I've had some lag to but it would resolve in a bit 
---
Usually if it's a event with a lot of players
---
Hadn’t thought of that. Also haven’t seen one pop up in a while.
---
The NEW or current bundle or a past one? As it is not listed in the current bundle package on the Atom Shop when I lst looked.
---
You can keep all of the perks of the armor (solar gives regen health over 60%) and you can get the extra damage out of berserkers. You just have minimal to no DR. That’s the only trade off. Seems like more reward to risk imo.
---
Which I never understood why it disappears?  It would be nice if you had an opportunity to buy whatever people scrapped - could be some gems in there
---
Equip aqua boy or girl n dive under water, 2 or 3 matches job done
---
But it's still gonna take 30+ minutes. That's the point.
---
Just check your stocks. That’s all i can say! Maybe for bolt action it’s only 1 specific stock. All I know is I get 60% extra damage haha
---
Hmmm good question. I’m not sure because I got the bundle the first time it came out last year. We’ll need someone who got the current bundle to chime in I suppose.
---
Which is still a significant amount of time for many players
---
Halfway to 23 right now.  Should be ok.  The nuclear winter ones seem pretty simple to do too.  Last night was kill 3 creatures.  Hopped into NW killed my 3 and left.  Easy 250.
---
Vanguard I think is best. But I prefer Bolstered or Unyielding because keeping max health when you factor in radiation is troublesome.
---
Minimum. Lobbies, etc.
---
Maybe restart the game, or come back later?
---
There's a shovel at Morgantown trainstation, on the west side on top of a potted plant.
---
Yup that's why I posted it but people still seem butt hurt about it
---
I use my SS jetpack to do the gentle iron man landing
---
Thanks for the tip. I will definitely be doing that from now on. I also noticed if you do the complete events one first it glitches and marks all of them. But that was just a theory so far.
---
I totally agree. I've got the middle finger too many times from bethesda, it takes it out of you. I find it so hard to complain now as I know nothing will get done about it. But I think if enough of us complain then they'll have no choice but to address the situation.
---
My friend is a noob. Real hard to be patient but I did. Ended switching to minecraft cos she got so flustered... Sigh.
---
I only use pipe weapons when a make a character for the level up daily. So it makes little difference to me but a extra 60% sounds good to me.
---
Yeah! Wish there was a easy way in game to send suggestions too.
---
Good information. Like a guy said below, I'm going to mix bolstering and unyielding. Just unsure of which type as I want to match them like my main.
---
You gave someone a legacy for 500 holiday gifts?
---
Did you just not complete Duty Calls?
---
hell yea
---
I join a match (party fill off) do the dishes, join another, do sweep the floors, join another, and continue while cleaning. I get the 30 minutes easily plus more of the cosmetics from getting to 100 (almost there doing this method) 
---
I play adventure  mode after I clean to get the rest
---
Wasn't there a gilded mini gun too?
---
I just bush wookie that shit while dicking around on my phone and doing random shit around the house. Sure you can do the 10,000xp repeatable instead but that requires actually playing. I can all but ignore the game and finish in the top 10 with a handful of caps and adventure mode xp on top of the 250 score.
---
Man that totally sucks. Sorry to hear. It's disheartening to say the least. Thanks for the tip. Will try that out :)
---
now they are all gone and so is the legacy
---
When you have done 3/5 of one thing u get the score, them nothing when completing it bq u already got it at 3/5
---
1 more day. It says it in the weekly challenge.
---
Yeah but you could still unlock some random shit from the matches during that time
---
Thank you! I am glad someone said it!
---
The only mod you need is the emergency protocol, it activates under 20% HP, it gaves 50% damage reduction and a lot of movement speed.
---
This perfectly captures the experience I had the other day. What’re you going to do, right?
---
Your words just miraculously fixed all my problems! Thanks stranger
---
Are you using mutations and junkies weapons? Its your choice after all, be *normal* or join Chad bloodied gang 😋, why cripple yourself. I cant go back, so much special points overall, agility, luck, str (carry weight most important) and int ofc
---
Emergency Protocols on the torso, combined with Life Giver rank 4.  Single best thing you can do for survivability.   Poison damage will continue to be a problem, though.
---
I dont think P.A. is capable of consent tho.
---
Not completely useless, just not the same. You use them to claim a "prize" outside the lode bearing event
---
How does the server crashing an hour AFTER you gave someone an item make them go away?
---
It’s Bethesda...
---
How many new Dailys u have? I just have 3 on Xbox (Buy something from Player /NW and Kill 10 Ferrals)
---
Ah man. That's horrible. Sorry to hear. They owe us all big time. I think they should at least extend the season like they did with fasnacht festival.
---
The comments on this post suggest being logged out when the dailies reset. A good tip :)
---
Halo: The Master Chief Collection is doing this exact thing. I can only hope halo infinite does the same.
---
Screw hype and time limited stuff, I have a life and a job.
---
Oh right. I forget about that damn thing. 
---
Now that you mention it I should swing by that machine. I’m sure I have several dozen of those tokens in my inventory.
---
How do you display things on couches? I saw a camp where somebody had all the school stuff laid out on the couch…
---
It's a piddly low-priority thing, but would it be possible to fix the display position on these?  Would be nice to display these lunch boxes, but they come in half-buried in the shelf/cabinet when displayed.
---
It also sticks up quite a bit behind the neck.
---
Hopefully someone who knows about server management will comment on this. I’m curious now too!
---
Yeah she seems to focus on whomever is doing the most damage but I could be wrong. I usually know right away when she aggros on me cause I’ll be dead lickity split haha.
---
u/Ladydevann is there any plans to do anything about the daily score bug? I’ve submitted a ticket and feedback to Bethesda about this, but it’s getting annoying. Twice I’ve been playing while the daily score challenges have refreshed and twice they have said that I’ve already done 4 of them, making me miss out on 1250 score each time this has happened. On the feedback site it says Bethesda can’t [more like wont] give you anything for lost score. I’m 2500 behind where I could be, and it’s really frustrating. I’d take score, or atoms so I could buy levels to catch up.
---
I wish we had more events like Encryptid where people actually go down in a fight.  I rarely see anyone to down during the SBQ.  Just feels like we need “deadlier” types of encounters where medics would shine
---
Oh, i've done the entire thing, but it gave me no s.c.o.r.e
---
I might try that, cause this is annoying
---
My non legendary can sneak headshot for around 1000
---
I do this for a living. That the CAMP shows up immediately means the determination of whether the camp can be placed occurs in microseconds. Hence any competent programmer could abort the process on failure and move to the next server without  wasting time.
---
In the web world we have these things called load balancers. When you send a request here to reddit a load balancer determines which of reddit's many servers actually does the work. Bethesda could do the same thing if they actually knew how to write netcode.  Instead of immediately connecting you to the server the load balancer - WHICH ALREADY HAS A CONNECTION TO THE SERVER - queries to see if placement of possible.  First server that says yes gets the placement.  If no placement is possible on any server then you get loaded into the best world for you based on proximity alone and you're informed of the situation - that your camp couldn't be loaded at all.
---
This isn't easy code to write, but it isn't rocket science either and the design patterns are already out there.  "It's an old engine" isn't an excuse either since this query is done outside the engine.
---
When I was just starting out of the vault, I tried to use ballistic weapons, had the same problem as you, always out of ammo.  Picked up a two handed weapon and stayed as a melee until I could start crafting enough ammo to make using ballistic weapons viable.
---
I keep thinking I'll save them for the big prize which is 100 tokens but then I forget to grab them from my inventory, not sure what I stashed them
---
Encryptid is good if you have Chinese stealth suit just mill around. Got this trophy couple of nights ago. Only trophies I have left to get are "join 20 teams", "kill 20 players" and "hack 50 terminals". The join 20 teams is a little frustrating to me because I thought the new teams system would help with it, but it doesn't seem to be counting as a team for the trophy
---
Pages. Use the trigger buttons to change page.
---
Yup...just regular tokens.  
---
https://i.imgur.com/3TWfaIz.jpg
---
oh did not noticed, thanks.
---
I bought a couple legendaries other players left back when legendaries stayed in the machine. They should put it back
---
I wonder. Does it just award scrap/ore at every prize level?
---
Well, both are quite popular but I never had any issues finding both. I'd just start with what you find first (random drops or spending script) then work up from there.
---
Alright, I love you too.
---
I wonder if the level scaling will help. I kinda wish there were ways for them to over scale some encounters. Nothing matches the fear of trying to navigate a high level white springs as a level 30
---
Thanks Moose!
---
I’m not trying to mix reality with fantasy , and Your absolutely right they are bigger but consider the science fiction aspect of it , things can be miniaturized but again it’s all fantasy at this point so why not.
---
Y’all do y’all imma play terraria
---
The waster pack doesn’t indicate an emote.  The power armor paint does indicate it works with any PA though.  Can anyone confirm that it works with Excavator armor?  I would assume so but am curious.  Don’t think I’ll drop the atoms though it’s tough not getting daily or weekly anymore
---
don’t you need stims to revive ppl? i’ve played all of 2 games ever, maybe you start with stims now that i think about it, idk lol
---
Wow that actually good. I might try it out sometime.
---
I did, don't remember how exactly. I did everything in a very strange order.
---
Ah so those 2000 points are gone then
---
It also doesn't seem to want to work on NW, I can't select it in the atomic shop as a NW fave
---
When I started my alt I didn't bother with armor, but gave them a level 0 brotherhood recon rifle and a bunch of .308 rounds.
---
Your mother smells of elderberries.
---
I refuse to change your mind, because I agree with you 100%.
---
The Fixer isn't the only one that suffers from this, skins for the .44 and the Western also share this issue despite sharing the same base models. I'm sure there are other "unique" weapon variants that also can't take skins you should normally be able to equip.
---
It’s worth having, yes. Gives you an option for rad resistance in nuke zones without needing to climb into Power Armor or don a Hazmat Suit.
---
This. This right here. It is like looking into a mirror. Thanks for saying that.
---
Worth any trade
---
If they removed the time limit it would also work. I'd prefer that they had no time limit but you had to finish this one or abandon it before you could start the next season.
---
That way if players really wanted to get to the end they could play at their own pace and it might take them 20 weeks, but at least they'd get there.
---
There is no leather armor in NW though.
---
Are you talking about the ghillie wood armor?
---
This was raised at a recent AMA. They said it would negatively impact performance to much.
---
Your inventory levels have A LOT to do with the “smoothness” as well.
---
I 100% agree. Seems like a good experiment though.
---
😿
---
I got a good vanguard piece that cost a good weapon, so I'm going to have to trade that again. I have some random and mixed unyeilding and bolstering for now. Chameleon etc too. Just farming like a fucker for now lol
---
[deleted]
---
Won't the shovel despawn tho?
---
Holy moly I thought I was doing good getting to like 18
---
But even then it is still lost score
---
Oh yeah, the wood armor, not leather
---
Yeah scaling potentially could help.  I agree, the difficulty early in higher level areas like Whitesprings is fun and challenging.  First time I went there I think I was running away from everything and relying on the bots to kill things haha
---
I’ve been doing this a lot, especially since I’m only level 31 so I can’t help a whole lot.
---
Yeah, that’s what I do
---
Honestly, really wishing somebody would have said something during a scorchbeast queen fight. I've been playing less than a week, so I only showed up in the area for a photo of the nuke dropping. One thing lead to another and I'm there fighting lv60ish enemies at around lv30 with no protection against the rads other than a lot of radx and rad-away. Long story short I may have caused the boss to reset.
---
Hopefully it's better
---
We're working on a fix for this right now, hopefully will have an update for you soon!
---
Ok?
---
Only for the Fallout 2nd-class mon-subscribers, apparently 😂
---
This literally just happened to me. It is completely unacceptable expecially considering how muvh score you have to get to finish the season
---
Yeah that’s what I mean.  Didn’t know it used to be a feature
---
This is specifically for those people who have only started doing NW because of the legendary run. People who have no interest in NW and only do it for the score points. It's to save them the absolute hassle.
---
Lovely, you guys that build like this make me realise I am one lazy as mofo when it comes to my camp.
---
Worth having that is for sure. Very useful for stealth and rad protection.
---
But you cannot trade or sell it.
---
fear of missing out
---
https://imgur.com/wH4Uv2q I saw on this thing on the bottom about submitting a ticket. Might not do anything, but maybe worth a shot!
---
No it's an online game.
---
I was asking cause value is 24k caps
---
Gunners, i wish i could join them
---
youre welcome
---
Google is amazing.
---
Worth getting yes, but it's worth nothing in trade as you can't trade it.
---
I don't know, and I was wondering the same thing, everything is an acronym these days, will we all stop speaking in complete sentences soon?  And I'm not going on google to find out, I'm going to create my own meaning for it.
---
you cannot trade it
---
Me too. Maybe not just like allies where they have a quest line or just give you side missions. But you could encounter people out in the wastelands that you could recruit to stay at your settlement. 
---
And then have it be similar to Fallout 4, where you have to give them a bed to sleep in, and have enough food and such. They can provide defense for you. And maybe ways to work around the camp. maybe they can auto repair things. Once a piece of camp is damage 50% or more, and you have the resources in your stash, they will repair for a cost of resources. 
---
But I agree, i like it when there's a trader at my camp along with the alley. And then some other players show to shop.
---
Yes it's happened to me just now so
---
I completely agree with this, like in RDO how most missions and some tasks award gold, which is their premium currency.
---
I support the idea of having a month or two as a break between seasons to let players relax, I think having seasons back-to-back is only going to risk player anxiety and burnout.
---
I find 76 incredibly relaxing, and the last thing I want is that relaxation to stop or get replaced with anxiety. I can already feel a bit of anxiety with this season by itself, but it's manageable so far. Please Bethesda, pace yourselves.
---
No FO1st members suffer the same. Granted a private server is smoother than a public one but if you play on a fresh character in either type of server you’ll notice immediately how smooth a lot of things are. Most notable would be crafting things and inventory UI navigation. 
---
PC users will notice this less as the average PC user has a rig that’s faster processing than PS4 and Xbox.
---
GANDAAAAAALF
---
Nah that’s pretty much the core of it. The game has been designed around creating fomo since shadowkeep through the season pass model. If you don’t grind bounties, you miss out on all the rewards and seasonal content which leaves at the end of the season; people got really burnt out, but make no mistake, every decision they made this year was centered around creating a sense of fomo.
---
Yeah that would be nice!
---
That's fair enough. I'd say try your luck in purveyor with 2* weapons and use them for leveling, kill legendaries, and save up more script. For giving you an example, if she gives you a mutant's slayer, go kill everything at west-tek and Huntersville, server hop and repeat. For troubleshooter, go to rob-co research and sugar grove. Ghoul's slayer, go to whitespring golf. Sounds pretty obvious, but most people would turn around and scrip that kind of guns and only expect god rolls. I've farmed west-tek for weeks with a mutant's slayer 50cal before I script it. Also pay attention on perks like tenderizer, adrenaline (broken with patch 20) and bloody mess that gives you straight damage boost. Also you might use psychobuff or overdrive. Xp boosts of all kind to level up faster. If your character has high STR you can do as well but with melee, so you save ammo and materials. There is countless ways to play this game, that make fallouts so great imo. I hope it helps you a bit, I'm not expert nor have thousands of hours played, but I can give a couple advices.
---
Also english is not my language, I hope I did well enough for you to understand lol :)
---
Wouldnt be able to since everything is on the servers
---
I have heard The two scenarios:
---
* logging into NW first before logging into adventure
---
* Being in adventure mode when the dailies reset
---
Anything else I‘ve heard but have not seen any evidence other than anecdotal stories.  I’m not saying it doesn’t happen, just that I can’t recreate those scenarios.  I have yet to have them auto complete as long as I avoid the two bullet points.
---
i dont fucking know but ive noticed a trend
---
Yeah, because according to them, its *our* fault Bethesda can't write proper code that can distinguish between NEW DAILIES and OLD.
---
Cant be traded. Plans or the suit
---
every time someone gives me something its gone when i leave
---
I've had her go after me and I was assuredly doing minimal damage compared to everyone else.
---
I’m talking about BSK
---
Interesting idea... I run a couple Berserker builds (Commando and Heavy) and went the other way with them.
---
2 addictions to get -20 DR so I can wear non-broken armor and still stay at 0 DR:
---
- Raider Underarmor 
---
- Full sets of level 1 armor (light leather and wood) 
---
I'll then swap out armor depending on the situation to get the 75% damage reduction for the primary enemies in each area (each full set weighs about 2.6 lbs so I can carry many with me)
---
- Zealot's - SBQ events
---
- Troubleshooter's - Silos, Encryptid, AWOL
---
- Ghoul Slayer's - Whitesprings
---
There's a certain satisfaction in being able face tank the SBQ or the Imposter while at 0 DR. It was even more fun when the Radicals Mask gave an additional 15% damage reduction (90% total), but that got nerfed... If I'm just tooling around I'll throw on Life Saving, and along with Mysterious Savior it keeps you upright most of the time. Bonus when Revenant kicks in for the extra damage output.
---
It did take me a while to grind all of the level 1 armor from the purveyor, but did pull a lot of weapon/ammo/FDC weight reduce mule pieces in the process :-)
---
Save the condescension. I do this for a living too, and I'm well aware of what a load balancer does. 
---
For one thing, Fallout 76 doesn't use standing servers; it's virtualized via Amazon's equivalent of Azure, with servers spun up and down as needed. And you can only do an out of engine query if the server code is set up to be able to pull a character's data for camp location and then check it against active world state to see if there's a conflict. It's a solid bet that it isn't, and the server has no way to pre-check that. I doubt the server code is even set up to load character data at all outside of the normal game process. It just gets handed info from the login server and starts a normal client connection; the current CAMP check process is just piggybacking on the original in-game code to pack up a CAMP if it can't be loaded.
---
This engine was *not* built to be a server/client setup. They had to do major surgery on it to get that to work at all. What amount of in-world data is accessible to the login servers and balancing process is likely minimal to nonexistent.
---
Takes 2 weeks to finish d2 season pass and max all 3 characters.  Only exotics and time gated missions to wait for that take a day.  Its nothing like this. 99% you can grind as much as you want in d2.

I too would like an "Oh shit I just accidentally scrapped my asylum dress/rare outift" please undo my baffoonery button.

Tokens from The Lode Bearing event are called Claim Tokens. 
---
The ones OP found are just Tokens. You can find more at Tyler County Fairgrounds. I have yet to find a use for these tokens.

I don't think a lot of people would be mad about it. I know I wouldn't be upset if they just packed it in and went back to the way it was before.
---
I think Beth really missed out on making these creatures horrifying and sad.
---
Sometimes when I’m attacked by scorched I’ll head them say something along the lines of “go. Run!” Like they know what they are doing and can’t stop
---
I use ultra cite plasma caster and Gatling laser. They absolutely shred!
---
Odds we get perk card loadouts in the future?
---
Username does NOT check out.
---
That is lame
---
It's an online game though. If you don't want to be around people there's always fallout 4 or any other previous fallout.
---
 You want to play by yourself then play on a private server, that costs money.
---
Even something as simple as making the treasury note trade in a weekly limit instead of daily would be good.
---
pop rad-x diluted before you fast travel just in case.
---
I always had issues with that, wish I could convert my 1000s of shotgun shells to something useful
---
Thanks guys - will sell it all and go tats
---
Like the other guys said, the scrip. Saving up for that sale and this one is super easy. And you always bag a little acid along the way.
---
for serums
---
Will the affected people get any sort of compensation?
---
Same. I completed fully the kill assorted robots and gather building supplies. I just sent in a ticket with a photo and hope for the best.
---
that AA/50L/250 lever looks pretty good
---
I'm also a little concerned about that little green piece that moves a space each day.
---
Yeah to be honest I'll just do what you're doing at some point and try bribe people with caps/weapons to just accept a team invite 20 times. Kill 20 people is the one I'm not looking forward to the most - can't stand Nuclear Winter.
---
That's what i did...and that's what won't give me S.C.O.R.E
---
Yeah I just don’t wanna pay $12/month to play solo. Kinda ridiculous and I would but I’ve already done every quest a few times in different play throughs for 3, NV, and 4... Might just jump back in Skyrim and mess around with mods
---
Atom shop right now. Flyboy bundle or Military Beret package.
---
If by "those people" you mean griefers, its because they're shit at pvp and don't want a fair fight. Not all pvpers do this, and NW is a completely different style of pvp. Its not for everyone, just like adventure pvp isn't for everyone either. People just need to start respecting each others play styles and stop with all the toxic bullshit, its getting really old.
---
So that's what's happening in those robot production canisters in Watoga.
---
This is why I just mute the annoying people. Luckily as of current we don't have a bunch of the late teen early adult shit bags causing problems. I would say that maybe once a week you get someone talking to people like an asshole, and maybe once a month one of those dicks who leave the event and try to jump in front of you to get you to start PvP.
---
Not a fan of it either. Managed to find three creatures to kill this morning in NW for the score points. Ugh
---
yeah would of been nice .. fallout with the capability for your friends to join your game and help out or just roam around .. but nope they chose this instead
---
just keep in the back of you mind .. if in the future they decide to move on to other ventures and shutdown the servers .. all those atom purchases and all that time and effort into your characters go poof haha
---
I use ultracite gatling laser and ultracite power armor too
---
Most of the warframe challenges I have not had a problem doing and some of them keep coming around like the thermia fractures and acolytes and it REMEMBERS your progress from before so if you did not finish you just pick up where you left off.
---
The more stealth skills the better. I can get an enemies attention have them aggro on me then duck down directly in front of them and instantly go into caution. I've had enemies walking into me and pushing me and they have no clue I am there. 
---
https://youtu.be/kGRQ3CUwrvY
---
Ultracite ammo and serums both use them
---
How is it moronic?  Hazmat suits you’ll come across in several different areas.  I never keep them as they aren’t that useful, but it’s not difficult to find. PA spawns in the world.  You get a full suit for the Excavator quest.  There’s even a set of PA that spawns in one of the SBQ bunkers.  The stealth suit is my go to item for wandering radiated areas.  Lots of options really.  I could see why low level players might have difficulty, but it does say level 50
---
Well said. Couldn't have said it any better myself honestly.
---
Thing is text chat is rarely a thing on console.  Even FFXIV which supported it,  found it to be uncommonly used by folks.  For an action based game like fallout that didn't have it previously it probably wasn't worth the time to add it in.
---
Explore the area. Read the notes. Follow the wire.
---
So I’m a veteran player, been active since launch. I’ve played largely solo until Patch 20 made it a breeze to join up in teams and the Legendary Run Challenges that encourage teamwork and event completion. Overall it’s been a blast as I’ve finally been able to participate in (and have a chance to complete) so many events that I would have stayed far away from previously. 
---
On two separate occasions on two different servers yesterday, I was berated by other players for not “correctly” doing Project Paradise and Radiation Rumble. Both events I had never even considered doing before, but felt brave, so I joined in. Because I was inexperienced, I tried to just hang back and keep mobs off of the players who clearly knew what they were doing. Both events are obviously fairly challenging, and we unfortunately failed both, and both times at least one of the other participants messaged me telling me that they couldn’t believe that someone at such a relatively high level would be so useless. 
---
I’ve been around long enough to know not to take it to heart, and that most of the player base isn’t like that, but toxic attitudes like that concern me because they may be enough to scare away new players.
---
My dailies today auto-completed with no score and I missed out on 2,000 or so. Bethesda owes me that, but I don’t expect them to address it unfortunately.
---
it was a marketing ploy .. outside the cabin area is a tree .. with some additional information and technology you should investigate
---
I want too or free ft couse don't make sense pay and not travel on a Brahmin
---
Well... I tested it and unfortunately it doesn't work... It doesn't count for the challenge if you level up from 1 to 2 but it does count if you level up from level 2 to 3.
---
So what you should do:
---
1) create new char, take that perk cards and level up to level 2, leave Vault 76
---
2) go straight to The Wayward and speak to Duchess, skip all dialog, accept her quest and play that overseer holotape she gives you (it's C.A.M.P. one)
---
3) go to the Flatwoods. Take and play next Overseer's holotape (it's inside the church).
---
This will level you up to level 3 and challenge will be completed. This I tested myself and it took around 8 minutes to do all that.
---
I use the ultracite gatlin laser but can't use the power armor because can't seem to get the plan for calibrated shocks 🤣👎
---
Didn’t even think about when they decide to shut down servers. That’s going to be a sad day for many. Hopefully they can fix up a local server option or generate an app that lets you run server on a separate PC
---
Feel free to add me: MoonTechGaming
---
What level are you btw, and what are you looking to do?
---
You can't travel into a nuke zone bit you can spawn or respawn in one? How does that make any sense especially since almost all SBQ fights happen outside the cloud.  If I can't spawn at WS when its nuked how come I can spawn at prime?
---
It is shit design.
---
That means doing it every single day and doing that intro scene over and over again every single day so far. They seem to keep putting on the gain one level thing every day.
---
Haters gonna hate, it's best to ignore karma on gaming subs.
---
I was in adventure today, and this exact thing happened to me. Auto completed with no score.
---
It's just the intro quest. Does not impact anything later
---
The two raider groups I’ve nothing to do with each other. The game will tell you when you’re about to make a choice that locks out some quests from the other side. 
---
Do both sides up until that point, and then make a decision.
---
It is a separate group so no implications on Raiders or Settlers.
---
That won't save you if they spawn you far enough away from the actual fight.
---
oh ok cool thank you
---
Have you done the vault raid? I think you also need to finish the quests for Duchess as well since he kind of takes over the upstairs.
---

More like an unintended bug. Since they got rid of it.
---
Wow, thank you all for clarification and the quick response!
---
Never knew that about staying grounded. Unfortunately I tend to bring my entire base camp with laser and missile turrets just for fun.
---
I believe that one just straight up drops from scorched enemies but not sure if it still does. I've only heard of the shotgun and revolver being rewards from Pleasant Valley tickets.
---
Doing my respec from power armor to stealth sniper took me at least that long to get enough levels to move all the points and get all the skills. Respec is just insane.
---
Yikes-
---
I feel you buddy, i lost 2k score too :\
---
Didn't give it to me ;-;
---
Bloodied Explosive Pipe Bolt Action Pistol with Forceful Stock and equip all 3 perks for non-automatic pistols and rifles for +120% damage
---
Yeah dude, it's a sweet rifle, I used it before I switched to junkies, I might suggest pairing it with the Executioners which is awesome when a high hp enemy when it gets below 50 health and I can throw in that instigating rifle as well for sweet one hits most places...and I still wouldn't feel right without adding some junk/flux or something.
---
Is your audio driver up to date?
---
Swapped.
---
Thanks.  Was this when the waster bundle was released a few days back?
---
I think the SBQ is designed to be fought inside the nuke zone to be honest. It's just that the vast majority of players prefer it to be outside.
---
Yes it is.
---
so true, so true
---
Great
---
I am having sounds everywhere except fo76.
---
#Yup.
---
I keep my stealth suit on the favorites wheel. If I spawn into a nuke zone, standard spawn protection gives me enough time to slap it on before I take rads.
---
I had one of these a few weeks ago, was just shouting at everyone for not doing the event his way...
---
Definitely drove me away from the game so there’s at least one
---
You're probably right, that's why noobs can't have nice things
---
Do u mean in the menu itself when u press play?
---
Because i had that issue. And it was just that my firewall was blocking the game suddenly.
---
I have an assassins shovel in my vendor for 10k caps.  On xbox.  LMAO
---
I keep a zealots shovel in my stash just for Buried with honor, i never could find one at the gravesite.
---
How in the world does a virtual video game’s xp system compare to making a living in real life? You turned something completely unrelated into a whole new issue just for the sake of arguing and trying to prove me wrong? All I said was score isn’t as big an issue as you want to make it be, anyone can make a high intelligence build easily or take advantage of xp buffs which has nothing to do with your wealth irl. If you just want to complain and keep saying the score system is difficult then don’t do it, it’s easier to level up than destiny 2’s season pass and I know getting to lvl 21 within one week of a ten week system is very manageable. If he’s 21 of 100 he only needs to earn 1,975 extra score if it’s only 25 extra per level. That’s two weekly challenges, it doesn’t add up very much at all.
---
Charity, unless the Brotherhood of Steel made you do it.
---
Hey does the audio start working when you plug in a headset? And are you on Xbox?
---
Great idea.
---
They want you to fail at keeping up so that you'll spend money to get the rewards you know lie at the end of the score chart. The fact that there is a definitive time deadline to this makes this all obvious in its manipulativeness.
---
I think it's a gamble of their reputation against whatever dollars they can continue to squeeze from the whales of this game.
---
Yea no for sure. I think people need to realize it's not the end of the world when it comes to mobs that aren't legendary. Missing 10 Mole Miners isn't gonna hurt you, most players don't even care about tagging mechanics unless it's for legendaries and just wanna get events done.
---
I am playing with a headset all the time.Its the game not my pc or headset because im also playing Rainbow Six and everything is fine there
---
This always happens during one violent night , douche shoots at low levels for playing music , and this point on not in it for the scrip just in it for the Notes
---
It already got squeezed out by evasive so no loss for me.
---
Im on Pc
---
On the other side of the coin, people SHOULD be listening to those veteran players if they are on mic and providing good advice. Common courtesy is not to kill the legendary by yourself... Take a shot/swing at it for 150hp and let others do some damage so the loot is shared. If you kill the legendary solo, YOU are the asshole.
---
That’s awesome good job
---
&gt;MoonTechGaming
---
just started and everything
---
Yes. But noone like the to flip between 10 pages
---
General rule of UI, don't make anything longer then 3 clicks (see ammo converter for example A although in my opinion its not that bad)
---
Then I'll get u started with some stuff!
---
Cobbler only gives +5% XP. Relish gives +10% XP.
---
I have my camp south of savage divide, just next to twin lakes. I'm sitting not too far from the pond with the behemoth (not too close to aggro it lol) and next to the scavenger that's around that place, and it works perfectly, i don't get attacked by anything. I used to put my camp in twin lakes but was always attacked by super mutants and liberators.
---
Hey just @ me next time. Seriously, I stand on the roof and snipe. I don't take a pylon. Sniping is what I'm good at. Taking damage is what I'm not so good at. Anyone who starts the event without a crew is taking a chance that it might fail. If there aren't enough people there capable of taking the pylons, it's probably doomed anyway. Frustrating, sure, but that's life.
---
Avoiding and hiding from other players is extremely easy. Not sure what you're on about.
---
together we fall my friend

There is nothing worse than a bunch of sweaty try-hards practically swallowing their mics as they bellow obnoxiously at you, "dude-bro"-style, about how you should play the game (you know, the one you purchased with your own money and foolishly thought you could play how you'd like, when you'd like) while in their presence.  In the words of Ferris Bueller, "It's so choice."
---
It's always these guys - and I emphasize **guys** because I rarely, if ever, encounter any women who behave like this, go figure (though I'm sure some exist somewhere) - who are really high-level and have every single event down to a "system" where this person has to do this while that person needs to stand over there and do the thing but ONLY WHEN WE TELL YOU TO AND DON'T YOU FUCKING DARE DO ANYTHING ELSE OR DO THE THING TOO SOON OR TOO LATE OR THE WHOLE THING'S RUINED AND IT'S YOUR FAULT FOREVER ALWAYS.  
---
Like, okay, Sergeant Slaughter; dial it down a little bit.  We know you're jonesing to kill the SB Queen in just a few shots or wrap up this other event in 30 seconds so you can go on your way with your big galaxy balls clanging together, but keep in mind not everyone has had the "Obnoxious Uber-Gamer" playbook to Fallout 76 downloaded into their brains, "Matrix"-style.  We don't all know the kung-fu you know.  Take a few deep breaths and get a firm grip on the fact that people play differently than you and they don't need to be loudly shamed for it.  You're not R. Lee Ermey in Full Metal Jacket and we're not your Private Pyle.
---
Just the possibility of running into people like them is the reason why I don't use voice chat, and if they ever implement text chat - which I hope like hell they don't - I'll just disable that, too.  My wife started playing too, and she's been thinking of using voice chat, but I'm advising her against it for the same reasons I avoid it.  As far as I'm concerned, you do your thing and I'll do mine and we'll all get along like clams.  Don't worry; I've played enough to get the gist of what I should and shouldn't do in any given event, and I usually stay out of the stuff I know I can't handle, so I most likely won't be the one to ruin your precious gameplay experience, but whoever joins you on your next adventure, try really hard not to act like a monumental jackass.
---
If it doesn't say anything its a yes
---
Decided to hop on with a smidge of hope. Went to rank 10 on the board in about 2 hours. Yeah Beth still has no grasp of how, at least the people I play with actually play. Meh I give up. Stuck with it for over a year and I can’t defend any aspect of it anymore. The clean sink giving dirty water? It’s like they have to make sure you get a small look at the cake then snatch it away before you get a taste. Then leave you with the cake tin.
---
It’s a great idea. Should be on the main page with the legendary run. 👍🏻
---
&gt;Big whoop  
---
That ain't what Winter's been saying.
---
As a new player information is welcomed, but not if there's an angry dude calling you stupid for not knowing.
---
I remember when me and my friend were about level 3 and we were building our first C.A.M.P. And this level 140 odd cane up to us and we were expecting to get our backsides handed to us, instead they dropped me a full suit of level 45 Excavator power Armor and my friend a laser rifle, we never saw that player again but I do hope they’re doing as well as we are now
---
Modus has it. Armory vendor, I think.
---
 You might have to server hop for it though - I dont think its always in stock.
---
It would make more sense for BGS to simply not make the nuke zone a spawn point as you cannot fast travel into them.
---
What gave that away? The fact that they said they fixed the damage bug over a year ago, and then have stayed dead silent about it when they were proved wrong a day later?
---
Yeah. Didn't notice the time when I was in an event. Oof.
---
they should incorporate it into an auto doc like from old world blues.
---
heal
---
change mutations
---
change appearance
---
get implants (minor buffs)
---
remove rads
---
Blowing up cars might be my favorite thing to do in contemporary fallout games.
---
They also added one to use 76 bobbleheads. Finally a use for the good half of bobbleheads I get that I don't need. Just eat them right away.
---
There was a time limit on the old system too. You couldn’t do yesterday’s daily quests after today’s had started.
---
# THANKS
---
I think they patched it so it does. I have not tried it let a friend borrow mine.
---
I have some issues with sound to, I have a Bluetooth device and if it disconnects (no battery), when I reconnect, the game doesn't get them and I don't have sound, if then I connect wired headset I doesn't work, I have to completely close the game and then works. 
---
It's s little nightmare for me. I don't know if it's your case.
---
Quick question, will blocking you stop showing the replies? Never had to block anyone before so I'm not sure what functions it has.
---
edit: Nevermind, it tells ne.
---
I have a full stealth suit and whenever I see a lower level player, I can always tell that they are nervous as they frantically look around for me. I’ll pop out of stealth and drop some items before giving a thumbs up. I like being the mysterious stranger lol.
---
Its not a human. Popcount don't lie
---
Or pay for them or get fallout 1st or get them by leveling up :)
---
Yeah! And it should be called: 
---
"Fallout 69"
---
And you have to use it upside down! And whenever you try to use it right side up, the screen automatically flips upside down again!
---
They designed the game to be focused on pvp but then abandoned it once they realized that people didn't want that.  Why should the SBQ be handled any differently? I have over 1500 hours in this game and if I fought the SBQ in the cloud more than ten times I would be shocked.
---
tickle the legendary moleminer is my new catchphrase now, thanks!
---
I found another thread that said to try this but idk if it’ll work,
---
“open sound control panel &gt; right click the "unit" you use ingame (for me it was my headset - arctis 7) &gt; properties &gt; advanced &gt; changed standard format to 1channel, 16bit, 48000hz (dvd-quality)””
---
i just want a scope so i dont ever have to use those disgusting iron sights.
---
i dont know why, but someone at bethesda hates weapons having good iron sights. probably the same guy who made the hunting rifle a left hand bolt.
---
Had the same exact issue. No issues with the new challenges up till now, but I guess you can't always be lucky... &gt;:(
---
Dun dun DUN, bilong (a failed attempt of doing the little song that plays when he appears and disappears)
---
I usually have enough time to fast travel before getting hit with rads.
---
The fact that they're not changing their approach one bit, keeping the "have to log in every day" mindset is why I finally deleted the game. They have no intention of changing and that makes me sad :(
---
I read this as tattoos at first and was like what the fuck this isn't fullmetal alchemist. I would however support a really good FullMetal Alchemist online game.
---
You were logged off during the reset an hour ago?
---
I cant believe i didnt ch3ck that before i posted. Thanks for the response!
---
No they will. Remember when they only ‘dipped their toes’ in non aesthetics? I remember having expectations like that, bethesda shattered all of them. Or their zeni over lords witch ever.
---
My boyfriend had the issue and we assumed it was because he was doing the challenges on reset. But today I wasnt even online and it happened:/
---
That one's not new.
---
They can review which challenges people complete and use this to determine which ones are required going forward.
---
Defo worth having, I use it instead of PA when I’m in a nuked zone
---
Hey if you never figured it out:
---
Settings- general - volume and audio output- char mixer- change it to “do nothing” 
---
And it should fix it for you!
---
I dont think this is a "Filer" or atleast not in the way you describe it
---
It was made by the Texas team if i believe, and that was a new team yes. But the main idea has been around sindce the first Fallout (Interplay kept the rights for an MMO after selling Fallout to Bethesda and later had to sell it to bethesda too)
---
This game begon development around the time FO4 launched. So this is more an exploration of the engines Multiplayer capacity as it was originally planned for FO4 and i do believe they will implement a sort of CO-OP mode for FO5
---
im already done
---
18 kills? Yeah I'm guessing so, sounds like an aimbot with all player positions highlighted. Some of them fly around and clip through everything blatantly as well.
---
OMG YES IT IS I AM BRAKEING NEWS RIGHT NOW
---
For now with radiation rumble and most hoarding events I try not to kill things too fast. I want everyone else to get slap damage for that sweet XP nectar. After this XP thing however I'll consider this for radiation rumble.
---
Use this: https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/490 it will solve all your problems:-)
---
I personally prefer the one with red veins
---
It just works.
---
The creation engine is just code on top of code on top of code by now.  Every new game, every new layer of code, the bugs get worse.  Not only that but theyre harder to fix and the bad code gets baked deeper and deeper into the engine.  
---
Starfield is gonna be a beautiful mess
---
Huh. Well that explains a lot.
---
And how long does this easy avoiding and easy hiding take? 
---
No matter how good you do it's still gonna take 30+ minutes. That was the entire point of this post.
---
Oh for real?! I didn’t try looking at the arm
---
I have something similiar: J/E pipe revolver.
---
Problem is, the meta is full auto. These pipe pistols shoot way too slow
---
Yes I logged off because my boyfriend thought the issue was that he was logged on doing his challenges when they reset.
---
Then you have to leave the event as traveling to the drop site can still leave you in a nuke zone depending on placement.  
---
It's more sensible to remove the nuke zone spots as spawn points
---
Oh it’s just the camo paint. Gotcha!
---
Yeah, you can add the camo jetpack on the arms/legs. I did not dare to try it, only ibstalled the dark matter jetpack on the torso.
---
pop another one
---
I want to share my thoughts as a very recent player. We enjoy seasons. My fiance and I bought the game like 3 weeks ago, have about 80 hours or so. We're casual, just playing for fun and building a nice CAMP
---
Before the season thing, we didn't care about challenges at all (even tho there was Atom rewards). Now with the season, we feel like playing to complete the dailies and weeklies - it's fun to see the rewards and have a goal to achieve them.
---
Clearly, we are not end game (level 35 only), so we do not have any experience with whatever grind is already in the game. We just do the daily and weeklies and continue with story/side quests. It's been addicting and has given us more of an incentive to keep playing.
---
That being said, it's only week one, and we are both very aware that it is pretty impossible to reach rank 100 (and both think Bethesda screwed up the implementation). Like everyone else has said, this Season is not very player friendly, especially for casuals. At the very least, even if we don't reach rank 100, we can still aim to get as many rewards as we can.
---
As a noob, I like this direction. But hope they tweak some things for season 2 (probably won't happen tho).
---
I love that fancy shotgun.
---
So much for Rule #9...
---
launching from the launcher...
---
In Grafton, climb up the fallen tree onto the shop sign.
---
From there to can walk along and climb on the roof.
---
From there you can pick off enemies much easier
---
&gt;ers that earne
---
Low level characters are easy to level up.  You don't need a "new" one every time you want to level.  You come out of the vault at level 2 (SCORE!).  Switch back to your main and play the day for the rest of the challenges.  Log in to your level 2 the next day, kill a few things and craft some food - BAM!  Level 3 SCORE!.  And so on.
---
What this guy says makes a lot of sense.
---

---
They should just do a 2mm cartridge with 250-500 rounds that is craftable at maybe 50% of the resources it would need to craft the same amount of normal 2mm and make that fit only on the gauss minigun. I think the other guns are ok with the existing ammo, though I'm not sure as I haven't used any of them yet.
---
Something similar could be done for the MG42, these things are also not feasible with the current ammo crafting.
---
Many things needs to be fixed, pal, but here we are.
---
Doing wastelanders quests will get you xp which will help with the season. However if you completely ignore the daily and weekly challenges you’ll have a hard time **completing** the season. 
---
Do you need to complete the season to get cool stuff? No. In fact a lot of interesting items (IMO) are early on, like the ammo converter and stars wallpaper. 
---
My advice is scan through the daily and weekly challenges when you log on and plan your time out accordingly. Most of them are super easy (ie eat 5 cooked meals). You should be able to bang these out with little issue. If you don’t have any raw meat or cooked meals on you (still using the cooked meat example), just go about what you were doing but be sure to collect the necessary items along the way, cook at a cooking station and eat it to compete challenge. No need to go out of your way for most of these things. 
---
Also, weeklies will be more bang for your buck so don’t lose sight of those. But you do have a whole week to complete them.
---
1cap is enough for them to buy
---
prosnap camera works..
---
I want the option to make my private server the previous survival server. Less a few issues but I like the idea of being hidden from the map.
---
I’ve lost on 2 separate occasions.  First one, no clue why.  Second one I logged in a min or two after, not all of the dailies even showed up, tried restarting and 2 were competed.
---
I’d like to think we’re all missing some common trigger, but I just think the simple explanation is that it is buggy code that should have been addressed... oh I dunno, on the PTS.
---
My advice, do the questline as it will increase the times the repeatable will trigger
---
HOWEVER i wouldnt only focus on the questline. Id take a breather or 2 after a big quest to mark a daily off. Unless its on the way.
---
I completed a few daily quest by chance
---
I'm aware of that. But people worked it out.. the season is impossible to complete without buying tiers or doing the repeatable challenges.
---
Could you explain that, please?
---
I would spend 10 perk points on (i) always working fast travel and (ii) corpses grow a bright green.  This is the only game I've ever played where I sometimes cannot find the body of the mob that I just killed.
---
It looks like such an event did/does exist: https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/The_Battle_that_Never_Was_(Versus)
---
Yeah also lol
---
That Bitch Carole Baskin.
---
I’m at lvl103 it take me a while to lvl compare to lvl50..
---
So wasting 2-3min starting a new character is still less time consuming then lvling on my main for that daily.  keep in mind that I’m trying to knock out the daily as fast as possible 30-60min
---
Im having a similar problem. I literally cant find the plans for the Ultracite Left Leg anywhere. Ive got 90% of the suit built, but with a janky T45 leg until I finally get the plan.
---
So sad, i can confirm wood not showing
---
Ffffffff
---
IDK the fireplace door is pretty sweet
---
Right! I know a player who has 1200+ treasury notes! I mean come on how unnecessary is that?!
---
From your lips to the goddess's ears.
---
Its like Elder Scrolls online. One in every series.
---
There's some taps in the game about this women that started to turn. Seems to me the scorched lose there ability to control themselves and end up being controlled by some sort of hive mind.
---
I have not really.  Maybe a range issue?
---
Just run up to the scorthbeast, jump (marsupial is key) vats and kill in one or two shots.
---
Did you also run Revenant? My goal with that was using marsupial without birdbones and to jump off something before going into battle, because Revenant goes active after revives. I kinda miss that style but I converted to a Bloodied shotgun instead.
---
Never had much issue myself, any shotgun with accuracy + enforcer.  Just tag those engines and it gets simple to deal with.
---
FYI: [https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/daily.html](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/daily.html)
---
I went to Morgantown, where you can sneeze on them and they die lol
---
Awesome! I didn't realize that. I guess it's time to go pop that serum, thanks for the info.
---
Can I get some clarification on Queen tactics?
---
The videos I watched said melee was king and shooting her in the air made her *not* land. That she could get staggered and not land. Is this still true?
---
I was part of a SBQ fight yesterday and for 15 minutes she landed like twice. I didn’t get enough hits on her with melee to get any rewards from her. And I didn’t shoot her in the sky because I thought it would cause her not to land. I cleaned up the ground mobs while she flew.
---
And yes, someone bug stacked their survival tent high in the air and stood on it. I don’t think they had aggro the whole fight though.
---
Was I wrong not to shoot her while flying (while everyone else did)? Or was the not landing because of the bugged tent?
---
Thats cool
---
It's happened to me when I wasn't logged in.  I have no idea what triggers it.
---
However, as an FYI, the first time it did it, I logged out and when I logged back in, it was fixed and my quests were undone.  Might want to try that if you haven't already.
---
sorry, i mostly hate acronyms too, but today's youth is all about TLDR (too long, didn't read), so I try to keep things short and speak their uh..."lingo"
---
thank you :)
---
uninstalled and then reinstalled the launcher, now it's working.
---
Her aggro rotates annoyingly
---
Yeah, that's an old one.
---
the camera shows whats in the frame in the upper right of the screen and it can see bodies you can not see with the naked eye..
---
you can find the corpse by looking around with the camera
---
I played purely solo so I never used revenant and my old berserker build was my bloodied main. Trying it with my combat medic now who is always in a team. Sounds like a good option to take.
---
My main issue is not taking it down, but getting it to be at range for my weapon. So many times has it flown too high for me to even tag it.
---
No need to waste ammo
---
Im already done, shame me
---
exactly lol
---
Sometimes emotes can get stuck in a loop, dunno what causes it. I think I've fixed it by going into photomode and cycling between poses, but that might have been for another problem.
---
I did try that thank you they didnt reset still :/ it was just two of them again.
---
Agreed.. love to have text chat
---
Im all for racking up some good XPs.. but I think for a challenge Id just kill some in the forest to get it over with quick..
---
then id go grind XPs..
---
Interesting. I’ve avoided it so far. Hopefully they eliminate the issue
---
This is amazing to see, you've done something right, mate :)
---
Revenant with life saving armor was OP. I just wish I could have gotten to the point of high damage because my armor wouldn't break. I spent at least a week trying everything.
---
She can’t land if the aggroed target is in a spot where there is not enough space for her. Since aggro changes randomly and quickly, everybody has to be on the ground and in a wide space.
---
Yes exacty like that;)
---
From a pure functionality standpoint, the ammo converter is the only reward worth worrying about. Everything else is reskins and the like. I am okay with that. You can get the ammo converter just by accident while leveling normally, so no loss for those who want practical, and a hard core goal for those who want decor.
---
My only objection is that you basically can't risk missing a day, unless you plan on using some of the reward atoms to nudge yourself ahead later. I have the time, but not everyone does, and that sucks for them.
---
"magic weapons" is basically modern day TSE. 
---
look it up on YouTube, bashing/vats hit chance/junkies/insigating guns with effective 200+ fire rate (or shotties in vats with the same stars) do insane amount of damage due to some weird game bug not being fixed for like half year or more. 
---
I have weightless junkies minigun that melts everything like in 2-5 bullets with 0 points invested in heavy guns (and no addictions either) just because it's "magic". mirelurk queens, benemoths literally die in 5 bullets with no build related to the gun itself, like the TSE was OP with no build involved. 
---
now the builds is different story. due to the ongoing " legendary race/season" ability to gain more XP per game time is very beneficial, simply because you are getting score per XP. that's where bloodied with Unyeiding gives real benefit of 15 INT which is +30℅ XP boost (and even 30 INT boost due to another weird bug counting unyielding bonus twice). will you skip that 30-60 XP boost? I would definitely not. plus bloodied makes many luckluster guns to be "OK". plus you can be both bloodied + junkies for more flexibility on the guns. do both.
---
Ive always wondered this. Most of time the queen lands rite on top of me despite everyone else being on tents and the fence. Only real trouble i have is when some one is there with a gatling gun and tank killer. Sure fire way to keep her from landing.
---
This is basically how I live irl...teaching our son son the same. Give when you can, be humble, be polite to people but dont take your eye off anyone close to you..
---
No problem man!(or Woman)
---
If you drop it it'll just poof after like 15 minutes
---
That's strange, it seems like 90% of the camps I visit have the stupid limb plans for sale.
---
Ultracite calibrated shocks plan only drops from Scorched Earth, and it has a stupidly low (&gt;1%) drop rate.
---
Yea I get that. I'm running melee in the burrow double dipping for that XP.
---
Not using mutations or addictions or bloodied, no. I'm playing a normal character, so all those crazy options are things I don't have.
---
Might be able to help what are playing on?
---
Grats
---
I use it to reach my daily 1400 caps limit at vendors. If I put it in my vendor? What's a good price? Didn't know until now that it's used for serums.
---
I ask new players to invite me to their team and make them a good base out of my own materials and make it nice. I then upgrade their weapons and give them 20 free Salisbury steaks and 50 purified water. Then I get out of their teams and ask for 1 thing in return. They do something nice to other people. No matter how small. If your new my gt on XBOX is LegoDwarf120. If you need me to upgrade and repair your weapons and want a nice base just ask. I give away at least 10 purified water to anyone who visits my shop.
---
Well done man, was it a melee weapon?
---
Trying to think of what that one *is*. Hrm.
---
ok, sweet
---
Not sure if intentional but I’m enjoying it!
---
Well that's what the challenge is.  Survive for 30 minutes, how else would you do it?
---
 Whether you're actually playing or not you still have to play 30 minutes....
---
 I guess I'm missing the point of this post.
---
Totally agree - in 30 min most other objectives can be completed... nothing but a waste of time
---
Just keep in mind that having rad sponge can annoy people on the team who use bloody builds. I remember seeing several posts about people annoyed at this.
---
Thanks! I'll try that
---
Pulse capacitor with flamer barrel
---
I think it's an online game, so I don't see how that would work.
---
Well I haven't had it happen before with anything else, at least not that I remember. I'll give that one a go if I get it again though, good shout.
---
It's the perfect nuked zone armor. If you die, so what, you get to come back. You can die in PA too.
---
Xbox here, thanks anyway
---
Damn that happened to me last night. Running Uranium Fever and a 354 was tearing up the supervisors while I was signaling others to come get a shot. I was standing right next to all three and only got a hit on one before he wipes them out. The level 60 and 80 in the run didn’t stand a chance. Why Mandalynn? Why were you such a prick?
---
Reassign
---
I wouldn't hold my breath on Bethesda fixing a bug quickly.  There are still FO4 bugs in this game.
---
I love just running around helping people out and fixing peoples camp stuff.
---
Holstering and Unholstering weapon should fix it.
---
way higher than that..
---
XP exploits were a thing...
---
Last one I did flew a racetrack pattern.  Enforcer doesn't care about damage from range dropoff, a 1 damage hit can pop the engine.  Once it was immobile I just walked over and gunned it down.
---
If you tab out during a loading screen wait until you're fully loaded back into the game before you tab back in. That stopped the resolution change happening for me.
---
Bloodied commando, fixer Primed, ballistic bock+pschotats+small guns bobble
---
Do it all once once. I went to Charleston Capitol. Killed ghouls, got thousands of XP, the score points racked up insanely fast.
---
No need to separate actions when you can do them all at once, especially if you're pinched for time like a lot of people seem to be it's a no brainer to rack up XP at the same time as doing a challenge that also gives you XP and SCORE.
---
But the liberty prime one can speak.....
---
1014. Pretty sure he was hacking though
---
Nah you dont need stims to revive people in NW. Stimpaks just let you rez faster.
---
Yeah done scorched earth so much to try and get the plans but they never seem to drop.
---
Ps4!
---
Jesus tho I feel like exploits become useless after level 250 or so because the do amount goes up every level
---
The in-game value is useless. I think it was meant to be a guide for how much you could maybe potentially get from a vendor but it's never accurate. I think Bethesda's intention along with the 30k cap limit was to give players a rough estimate of what to price stuff at in their vendor. But that never works because people have so many alts now so items are being sold for more than 30k.
---
Saw a level 10001. Easily got banned
---
Seen a 2000-something one time, few in the thousands. Not often though. Most in everyday viewing is usually in the 4-500 area.
---
Considering the exploits Id be very surprised if people hadn't clocked the system and hit some sort of cap. 9999 maybe.
---
Ooh. I need to reconfigure my shop for new players then. Danke!
---
Adding 👍🏻
---
I seen a lvl 1000+ in PS4, I don't remember his name but holy sh*t
---
I seen a level 961 just tear up Fasnacht.
---
Haha, I just hit level 25 so I picked up a .50....yeah...all I do is deplete ammo looking for scrap to replenish said ammo. I feel like I'm stuck in a loop.
---
I keep a 10mm SMG and an auto suppressed pipe pistol on hand to lighten the grind a but. Seems most low level perk card are geared toward pistols anyways. Might as well try to take advantage of the situation.
---
You have 1500 hrs and you don't carry a hazmat? Very simple, and not difficult to make space for.
---
Adding!
---
I sided with them but I'm still considered hostile by raiders so no it dose not :/
---
Better yet, make legendary corpses glow like the appearing legendary enemies, until the corpse or meat pile despawns.
---
Ill just wait and get the couple things i want out of the atom shop in few months. The overall rewards are to miniscule for the grinding involved. Let me pick or reroll a couple stars and i would be grinding the crap out of it.
---
Pretty sure I tried that one, but maybe I missed it. Great, thanks for that.
---
Even though I know what's going on that scream makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up every time. It was way creepier before people came back though.
---
Damn playing of PC unfortunately 👎 good luck bud.
---
The only think i really hate is that they force you to play NW. That's pure shit, i never and never wanted to play that. "Play 30 minutes in NW" is broken, i played a 19 mins match and a 13 mins one and had to play another game as it counted 28 mins. FUCK. if you had the time between various matches i spent 1 hour doing that. I did that while watching a tv series, just waiting and avoiding enemies.
---
No its not
---
Shotgun is OP for crowd control on everything except SB and sheepsquach. The trick is enforcer, it rolls per pellet.  Fun trick is if you disable all robot weapons they go into self destruct, it's a hoot in watoga.
---
Thank you!!
---
It's gonna take longer than 30 minutes to do. 
---
getting in and lobbies and whatnot. 
---
And then they've got to stay alive for 30 minutes. Regular players will know how to do that. Someone who has played twice probably wont. Say they die 6 times to get that 30 minutes. That's 6 lobbies waiting for a game. Say 3 minutes a lobby. It could take close to an hour to get those 30 minutes and 250 points. 
---
In that time they could join a public team. Use some xp boosters. Do events. Kill things. Earn stuff. They could get the 10000 xp repeatable twice easily which equates to 200 score.
---
I have a couple of friends over a 1000 and no experience glitches
---
I ain't going to get to one hundred
---
Genetic Enhancements (from) Nuclear Exposure?
---
Exactly! Help out when you can, but still watch your back just in case!
---
Fk i really wanna do a shotgun build now
---
Not all my toons carry hazmat suits.
---
Why should the nuke zone be a spawn point?
---
yea i couldnt really figure it out but i saw the picture spin and i found the sirens but couldnt find anything on why they did it
---
Check out youtube.
---
Always been possible for other players to loot your junk bag.  When they do, the quest marker dissapears.  I don't understand why this is a mystery or how you don't know this after 1841 hrs played.
---
You are lucky the guy was nice enough to return your stuff.
---
I was picking up, what you we’re putting down.
---
Even with the 25 more score compounding per level, if you've hit level 20 by now, at the same rate of xp gain you'll finish 23 days early. With all the xp buffs available now with the last patch it's pretty easy to gain 100k xp per hour if you're over level 50. I managed over 300k xp in a little under 3 hours this morning and only half of the time was spent actually trying to grind xp, the rest I was just doing dailies and ally quests.
---
The xp buff/stats I've been using are: 5 base INT, Unyielding armor set, public building team (1-4 INT), Inspirational level 3 (15% xp), Strange in Numbers with Carnivore mutation with squirrel stew (25%xp), lunchbox (25-100% xp depending on how many people open one in the same area), Broiled scorchbeast brain +6INT. Each INT point adds about 2%xp from what I've been told. 
---
Either way I'm getting around 350-450xp per level 68 super mutant kill with that setup, depending on active buffs (it's difficult to keep all active or at full power, but I've never seen below 300xp per mutant regardless).
---
Breaking*
---
If you’re  looking for some more of the imperishable goods, flat woods has a level 2 locked fridge with at least 6 food items in it. Razorgrain soup is ok too since it heals 30hp each.
---
Thank you for trying! I love this community for a reason
---
Thank you for helping others out there!!
---
For me it seems to be relogging for any circumstance.
---
Was thinking, big woop 1k damage until I saw the "per hit" bit. 
---
Very noice. I have a long way to go.
---
Make sure you sniffle, snort, and cough into the mic as loud as you can. Can’t stand those clowns
---
OMG STAHP
---
No problem. It at least always works for me when I get stuck there, and it's worked for anyone else I've said to try it on PS4.
---
Honestly i would be happy if they just increase the carry weight from the calibrated ahocks from +50 per leg to +100 per leg. I'm in a frickin power armor and have like 200 overweight cause the backpack and the armor perks with reduced weight don't apply
---
Perfect, cheers mate.
---
I'll be happy if I can get to the rank 91-99 rewards. I've made peace with that fact that I won't be able to collect everything because I don't enjoy playing NW.
---
I frequently craft ultracite ammo which requires ultracite.
---
the burping is the best
---
Where is the recipe for ballistic bock? I just realized this existed and I wanna craft it but don’t have the recipe. I’m assuming it’s a reward for the Biv daily
---
Not sure if anyone mentioned this, but if the shovel is missing, you can try and fail to bury the remains, this will spawn a new shovel behind the nearby tree for you to use.
---
Unyielding shadowed leather, full set of armour. 
---
You can crouch in front of max level super mutants like you’re not there, and get huge stat gains from unyielding (even more stealthy, very high and xp gains from the get go).
---
If you can’t get all unyielding grab life saving, bolstering or just keep a regular shadowed leather piece of armour for the sneak.
---
I have there are also people on there that think the world is flat. I'm literally at rank 26 right now primarily from the repeatable exp one. According to the road map people where supposed to be at rank by tomorrow when the week resets so if your past that your ahead
---
Karens everywhwre
---
yeah i cant see anywhere on the thing the light could be coming from, so i dont think its intentional lol
---
Extremely infomercial voice: It's never been easier, just change your entire build in a game that doesn't have a system for loadouts!
---
Saw a level 6000+ yesterday, literally teleporting around a small area in PA. covering about 100m in under a second. Stumbled upon him at SBQ, him and a friend killed it within 3 seconds. Then they flashed around the nuke zone, killing everything in mere milliseconds.
---
I stopped playing Fortnite because FOMO was the driving force and it took playing most of the season after paying for it to unlock everything. Took all the fun out.  This grind they've created here is even worse. They could have made it so playing 50-70% of the time gives you the unlocks, but no, they went head first into making playing this game a job. Play all the time, get all dailies and weeklies, or miss out on the big prize at the end. If I miss something, I really don't give a damn at this point because I know the odds are stacked against me.
---
Yup that's correct and what i got.
---
It is a welcome feature.
---
What?
---
&gt;limit it to only missed cosmetics
---
Lmao, no, just no, people need to stop giving AAA companies ground to hold on to.
---
There's no excuse for ANY of this stuff to exist in the video game industry in paid games.  No microtransactions in paid games, no "season passes", no pre orders, etc.  The "just cosmetic" argument is as bad as every other one, these companies don't get to cry poverty.
---
Yeah, it's biv 👍
---
And the dreaded murder bears. Too much stagger.
---
It is a stash box skin
---
hahahaha your comment is gold
---
The plan fir the footlocker? So if my stash is full so would it?
---
I go to sunny top and do the athletics test, its repeatable, rewards caps and have gotten up to 1000xp per run, usually around 800xp tho depending on buffs.
---
I generally get 2 hours to grind everything during the week.. that’s the 2 hours before the dailies change .. it gets a bit frantic!
---
Glad to see new players coming in and enjoying them selves, lots of things to see and do in the wasteland
---
I can't even sell 45 and 556 for 1 cap. Lol they sit there forever
---
Hi Todd!
---
Oh my! Gets the heart going tho I bet!
---
Shoot one of the 4 engines first and they slow down drastically.
---
The game is what it is.  Good or bad.
---
[nukes&amp;dragons](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks) is the site most people use.. 
---
for example here is one of [My Builds](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=6b455be&amp;d=sa0sg2pd2pk2e82c72i11ic2a72lr2l10pp0pl2lt2a02e00a31lv1l71ao0an0ar0p00cu0sv0sb0lk2&amp;w=p80p90c52ij2i42iq2pa0lm0at0ed3i30ia0i50if2ik0&amp;m=8c5&amp;am=-13-1f-1321-1d&amp;wp=w5w5w5w5&amp;wm=1a2936-1124-17-1d) plugged into it...
---
All that stuff I typed and all you got out of it was fireplace door?
---
I would of been at rank 20 but my challenges didnt reset. I havent been playing as much as I maybe should of. I just know people have had this bug too it's not just me.
---
Just enjoy the game without putting too much time on optimizing a build.  
---
Anyway, look at  [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks)  to help you build a build.
---
I mean the game usually gets a lot of hate because of the bugs and stuff. But the content is really good I never get bored playing this game tbh.
---
we get the point..
---
Nukes And Dragons I think is what the site is called? They have a great build planner. 
---
But to be honest, don't worry about a build. Play the game as you feel like playing it, so that you don't get sucked into a specific play style for the first 75 levels. Play the way you want to play, and as time goes on, you can change and modify your build. 
---
I am level 195 and have 51 unused points if I want to  change my build. Make the adventure your own, don't follow a cookie cutter build that will deprive you of experiencing all the fun the game has to offer.
---
I think Fallout 76 will be forever broken.  No point to grind when there are numerous bugs, exploits, failed events and challenges.
---
be sure to try out our latest edition of Skyrim.. "Fridge Ready". ..  
---
p.s pre-order now for a dragonborn fridge magnet
---
If your stash box is full the footlocker would also be full
---
Sure does!
---
Isn’t it also funny how you need bloody mess to do that? 😂
---
the wastelander one, that you buy on the digital shop and not the Atom store? no. it does not include any emotes.
---
the Waster one, that is in the Atom shop? no idea, never bought it. but i'll say maybe.
---
Because the queen spawns in the nuke zone, the event is in the nuke zone, the story of the game is centred around surviving the nuke zone in order to destroy the queen.
---
Why shouldn't it be? Because your toon doesn't want to carry a hazmat suit in a post apocalyptic wasteland?
---
Dang. So three isn’t any storage that isn’t a stash box skin?
---
This is 1000% correct. Kids absorb everything good and bad. He has seen this act of selflessness from you or his mother. I would be a very proud parent.
---
I agree I like the warm yellow compared to green
---
Are you also aware that the queen takes little or no explosive damage, so some weapons are better without
---
They still are going strong, seen a video this morning with someone hitting level 100 on the board with an exploit.
---
It's a hoot on melee.  I kept a crappy disposable shotgun around with the accuracy while ADS and enforcer perks, that's about it.  Made for excellent o-shit option when big stuff jumps ya (I rarely vats on melee build).
---
doesnt seem like fun to me.. but whatever floats their boat I guess...
---
The directional orientation is better too in my opinion
---
mostly.. anger and outrage...
---
The gauss shotgun gets a lot of its damage from the explosive part of it, and scorchbeasts seem to have some sort of explosive resistance
---
South corner of ash heap there is a small opening of grass i used to have my camp there it’s definitely isolated and you only get mole rats n other lower level enemies
---
...why?
---
Unfortunately, the camo jetpack showing up on all pieces only puts a camo skin (so no double dip like in ultracite / strangler)... The piece changes to "Jet Pack T-65 Arm" in name, but it doesn't come with the - 1 AP function and you don't get a jet when jumping.. It becomes a very expensive paint... (just tried it myself). The dark matter jet pack does work on the torso however :) looks absolutely massive and has very narrow jets when flying.
---
Yeah, I hate getting rewards for just playing the game. I wish they'd stop forcing free stuff on me. I mean, I just got a big pile of atoms, just for doing some random thing. Where am I going to store them?! It's not like I have a big jar or something. Thanks, Bethesda!
---
Agreed! I meant no negativity. I actively play both and enjoy them.
---
Cut your losses and find a different game or hobby.
---
It should work. Just hold the bolstering button for a second and it will correct the animation loop. Happens to me daily
---
Might just go back to shooters. 
---
Got into loot grind games couple years ago.  Really like them.  But last year or two I just feel like it’s all grind no fun play anymore.
---
I didn’t have mods on my arms or helmet so I’m wearing the camo paint on them now. I’m sure the proper paint will come out eventually. Can’t wait. Looks great!
---
There’s a little light mounted on the helmet. It seems intentional
---
I am not trying to prove you wrong. I don't really care about the whole thing, it's just a game and some virtual items. But for many people it is a problem how the system is designed, since not everyone can invest that much time or money to get the stuff.
---
Yes, my real life analogy was provocative and completely over the top (thus the "sarcasm" annotation), but it still applies to some extent. Not everyone has the resources (here: time or money) to work for their fortune (here: items). Those level 33+ guys may have much time at their hands, but many of us are glad when we can play a few hours a week. Every single mechanic in the game is designed to punish those who can't play regularly, so it is not a surprise people are frustrated, is it?
---
EDIT: and them being level 20 now does not mean they have the time to keep this up.
---
Na. It’s a tough luck senerio. That happened to me once.. and one time it was that I completed it just that it didn’t check off and the extra challenge carried on to the next day.. this bug is annoying af! Cost me score point... I could’ve been at the star wall paper by now!!
---
This is so awesome. My 9 year old son also plays and it has been so fun adventuring around the wasteland with him.
---
5/7 autocomplete for me today, dat some bullshitty
---
If you want to have fun I honestly would not worry too much about your build. A lot of people on here spend all their time min/maxing and grinding end game rewards. 
---
This is just my opinion, but it’s more enjoyable for me to take your time, explore, figure out what works for you. You can always adjust later on.
---
That's pretty awesome and all, but damn this is a very violent game tbh with alot of gore. Idk if that's the best for a youngin. Just my opinion.
---
I know I just wish people would accept the bones of what this or elder scrolls is.  I got from love to hate 15 times a play session but at the end it is what it is.
---
If you're looking for a fully polished game with few flaws you've come to the wrong franchise. Both the Elder Scrolls and Fallout games under Bethesda have always been incredibly buggy. This is the first game they've ever had to go back and actually fix the issues that weren't absolutely game breaking. To top it off it's not even the A team handling it, it's a side studio that was fairly recently acquired that has little experience in developing a game like this. Not that their main team has any experience either.
---
The Monster Hunter series is a long standing multiplayer franchise so it's no wonder the most recent release is much more polished than Bethesdas first attempt at a multiplayer online game in a dated single player engine. I don't think it's a very fair comparison personally. That's not to say that the 76 dev team doesn't have room for improvement, I think it's obvious that they do. But to expect them to be anywhere near on the same level as a group of devs with nearly 2 decades of experience making online games is a little silly.
---
So basically you find the daily stuff so boring you want to do it as fast as possible since it is not fun to do. That is not why I play games. The play part is quite important.
---
Pretty amazing how a kind act in a video game will reflect the type of kid he is away from it and the type of dad you are. Some people just "get" it... in game and in real life. You guys clearly do. That's awesome, man.
---
But it's a *clean sink*; it's not a dirty sink. It's not the sink's fault that it's hooked up to a dirty water supply. It isn't called "Clean sink with inline water filters". It is what it's called: a clean sink.    
---
Go examine your own sinks. See if you can spot the device that detects if the sink is clean or dirty prior to dispensing water. Oh, wait, the water doesn't care about the sink, does it?
---
I had this happen once, my first nuke run as well, so I know your pain. When I tried googling some answers all I got was that the game apparently glitched and killed everything instead of turning them into higher tier enemies and, well, too bad. Sorry this happened friend, just know others share your frustration lol
---
Edit: this was on my private server as well. Someone said to log out and back in but I dont believe that worked for me.
---
Love moments like this.  There’s a farm in the north section of Cranberry Bog (think it’s called Mac’s Farm) that’s close to a fissure site and also has a sink hole that a Queen Mirlurker spawns at.  With a bit of planning (and lots of luck) you can get a Scorchbeast (or two) to spawn or follow you there while engaging the Queen.  About a month ago I was fortunate to get a Legendary Sheepsquatch to spawn there along with the Queen and a Scorchbeast.  Ol Sheepy prevailed at the end but believe it was because of his Legendary health replenish when it gets low.
---
That's more like gimped. If you dont like low health builds, use junkies for sure, that's straight 50% more dmg with junkies guns. Take railway rifle btw, with auto piston and vats that thing shreds even with zero mutations and such
---
Spiked bat works wonders for saving ammo at lower levels.
---
I voted to put myself there
---
And as we all know
---
Democracy is non negotiable
---
Ya thank you for explaining to me.
---
It’s a realistic number if you get a good nuke off. I’ve gotten 14 that way before. In the end though, it’s blatant cheating. I honestly feel bad for PC players who try out NW
---
It’s kinda the point of seasons. You earn your way as far as you can for each one. Having the rewards for 100 is just a way to mark that you really took to the grind. It seems very “millennial” to want a chance to get the trophy for a season without completing the season within its allotted time.
---
Gunsmith 5-stars. Reduces weapon degradation. I can go through thousands of rounds with my gun still at more than 100% condition (because I use Weapon Artisan 3-star to repair them to 200% to begin with).
---
It's SO helpful to have a weapon keep accurate/consistent throughout entire long-running battles.
---
I used Tank Killer for a while, but wasn't sure it was doing anything. But Glow Sight is an excellent secret weapon.
---
No problem friend. Good luck next run!
---
This is really very kind of you. Maybe there are more people around doing stuff like that. There were often invites from others but I never accepted them, because I really was never interested in socializing or talking to people over the mic... Maybe I missed a lot of nice opportunities and maybe some people thought of me that I might be an old grumpy fart, but it took me a very long time to accept the multiplayer part of 76 after I have been trying very hard to play it as solo as possible like I was used to.
---
Ended up cancelling my Fallout 1st subscription. Another day where essentially two of the scores are tied to leveling up (level up and get 5/6 challenges). It will probably be that way for the whole event. This is just too grindy when I could be playing something. I will just pretend the event does not exist from now on and will just cut back on playing.
---
Your nuke killed everything that was there, no joke. It's a shitty senerio but the reason it works so well in a public server is other players coming into the area cause the ghouls &amp; everything else to respawn. In a private server you have far less players so they don't respawn as quickly. A way around this is have a teammate or yourself leave the server &amp; come back in. That works for my team.
---
I know it has some of the lowest DR out of the armors, but I got a full set of uny ap marine armor and I love it
---
Problem? No. I think you got a solution ;)
---
Had someone do this yesterday, I had a regular cross bow and was trying to find how to get a better one, they came to me dropped 3 3star legendary and say enjoy, was pretty suprised and happy
---
seasons is the only reason why i had to start playing the game and stop putting it off
---
You are! I just happen to have a ton of friends from marketplace that run queens like it’s their job. 
---
I think with just dailies before today 20-21 was the high.
---
Hard to do when there’s not much else content unfortunately
---
I love the look of it too. It’s weird how it says it’s one of the best in the loading screens.
---
Unfortunately I play on Xbox
---
Do you really need to Reach level 100? I will be content with getting to around 60-70 (there ends stuff that is interesting for me). Do you really need this another zazzy, weirdo, "funny" outfit in this game.
---
well, the scrap box that Fallout 1st members puts junk in a different "stash", and it's got infinite storage cuz its just the junk. but otherwise, no, any and all containers you can build link directly to your usual Stash.
---
What new content?
---
my heady used a 2shot crippling autogrenade especially for this event. equipp demolishionist and grenadier and and some hundred grenades made him a king of area denial.
---
If you still have brain fungus soup I’d take some later today! =)
---
Yeah I watched the whole time, no nuke. Someone messaged me asking if it was the same player he encountered and it was. I wonder how Bethesda actually reviews these cases. Guy was like level 125, why risk your high level account? Makes more sense if you do it to do it on a lower level or something, unless he's cheated from 1-125 :/
---
Yeah, if you are going by pure efficiency of time. But many of use can hide in NW while doing other things, which isn't possible if you are trying to farm xp in Adventure mode. So I consider it something to do while I'm wasting time rather than a waste of time.
---
Oh, that stinks.  Sorry.  Back in the day The Whitesprings was the place to nuke.  Great experience and tons of legendaries.  Everyone who zoned in spawned additional glowing ghouls.  The WS now has been nerfed to the point that I barely even use it when grinding experience and certainly isn’t the legendary loot piñata it once was.
---
I’m just happy that my son has taken an interest in it! I honestly thought he would quit after the free weekend because he’d get bored. He’s loving it though!
---
What’s wrong with adrenaline?
---
Considering the large amount of posts regarding the math behind the pass, I think it's safe to say it's poorly designed.
---
The biggest problem is that you can't go back and finish missed challenges. Even if they lower the required amount of points for next season, the issue of getting behind is still there.
---
There are so many games out there with these types of passes, I don't understand how they landed on such a bad design.
---
Thanks for the info, do you by chance know any good spots for XP?
---
I usually painfully hobble to Watoga to sell my junk and weapons. It's usually about 2100 caps worth of stuff without hard  bargain or chems. I still wind up scrapping a lot of it.
---
As long as you don’t one shot legendaries I’ll be happy
---
I went from playing on a PS4 Pro to a slim (Pro died) and honestly its better and smoother on the slim.  It still runs like hot garbage but I don't crash nearly as often.  Makes sense that the game is more optimized to run on the lesser of the two consoles though because Bethesda.
---
This happened to me too on a private server. I logged out, rejoined and the radiated ghouls re spawned. Only did it twice with my team staying in the server but worked both times. I don’t know if you need someone on the server for you to rejoin for it to work but the private server stays open for 5-10 mins so should work solo if you log back in quick enough. Good luck.
---
&gt;Rewards are pretty much ‘shit’ IMO      
---
     
---
Then why do you care about reaching level 100? You want to waste your time on "shit"?       
---
&gt;...forced ‘grind’ mechanics...       
---
"Forced?" You're forced to grind for something you don't want?    
---
Who is forcing you to play a game that you apparently hate so much?
---
I tossed it back and forth for a while if I wanted to let him play it or not. I’m honestly not too worried about the violence because he does understand that he’s just playing a game, but I understand your opinion!
---
Ah ok. Thanks for the info!!
---
Thanks ill try that
---
This doesn't happen with the SBQ though, no matter how many players show up.
---
Thank you! I try and push empathy as hard as I can for my kids. Their all very blessed in life and they do like to try and help others when it’s needed. Makes me feel great lol
---
The community of this game can be pretty amazing!
---
I built a new set of leather every 5ish levels.  Did that until I got to around 50 or so.  Cheap and didn't require anything rare.  I prefer matching my gear since your doomed to the hobo look post 50.
---
Weapon I ran with mostly a level appropriate board.  Ranged unused throwing knives for a good while, they hit quite hard compared to early kit and are dirt cheap.  Shotgun of any type/level with enforcer for dealing with high threat.
---
Lol I feared the same thing. He's a Fortnite player and I just want him to branch out and experience other types of games. So far so good!
---
Happy adventuring 😊
---
Do you have a source for this info please?
---
its not cumulative ?
---
Get your reality out of here! This is a certified echo-chamber circle-jerk, and there's no room for anyone trying to interject facts that counteract our delusions!
---
yeah mostly my goal is to explore and not have to worry about dying because i did bad stats lol
---
This community is pretty awesome. I have been playing for months now and finally had another player kill me last night for the first time. Coming from the Red Dead/GTA communities, color me impressed.
---
What the fuck is a Stimpak????
---
Line in the Sand is great for Claim Tickets too. I got 3 from one event once.
---
Why do people like you even bother playing a multiplayer game if you dont want to interact with other players?
---
It is... but every match I've been in has been very minimal movement from most players.
---
Bethesda unfortunately just does not release polished games. Their games are very popular no doubt, but they all have bugs or issues that never really get fixed. 
---
Unfortunately because their games are popular and make money, I doubt they'll change anytime soon. We can be hopeful tho!
---
I will agree that Capcom turned it around BIG TIME. Monster Hunter is just one prime example, but after, they followed up with the Resident Evil remakes, Devil may Cry. I remember just recently when capcom was called crapcom, but now they're back baby! 
---
Maybe Bethesda will have a change of heart, as their public reception seems to be getting worse. FO76 and Elder Scrolls Blades are both going the way of microtransaction pay to win. I don't like what I see. Maybe all the funding will go into an amazing Elder Scrolls VI or Fallout 5. But I feel those games will be very similar to what we have now
---
Unlikely. Probably caused the event to fail too
---
Your doing gods work son.
---
Good luck out there!
---
okay awesome, that was more of my curiosity seeing all the posts saying optimized/ plan out builds. great news! thanks!
---
Okay "boomer" I agree with you though just don't like you shitting on millennials.
---
Because you're not a shitter, obviously
---
Isn’t FOMO why battle passes, seasons, and limited time events exist in the first place? Like any casino, they’re banking on you not having the willpower to walk away. I’m sure a dedicated handful will power their way to 100, there will be a group who throw up their hands in surrender and protest, a portion of players that will be happy with wherever they land on the board at the end, and several buying their last ranks with Atoms because it will torment them not to finish the run. My guess is Bethesda ultimately only cares about the Atom spend, as this will indicate if they’ve hit their FOMO targets. They have to drive urgency, but can’t frustrate too many or the game will lose players. I have no doubt this has been very carefully planned since 76 launched, and is proceeding exactly to plan.
---
There's a fancy pump action shotgun too.
---
Edit: Wait, did you already know about the shotgun? Does that mean you got one already? *Cries in not having either.*
---
People like that should try playing with real people in the same room. See what kind of response they get within face-smashing distance (not condoning violence without cause here).
---
But seriously this presumption that people share your exact same goals and methodology (in games and in life) is one of the biggest fuck-ups you can make.
---
220,275 is the correct number. Level 1 is where you start. Level 2 is 1000, level 3 is 1025. 
---
Challenges will bring you to 215,000. 
---
5,275 remaining can be received from xp.
---
I did that for 30 mins &amp; left.
---
It’s honestly the best online community I’ve been a part of in a game. (Granted I don’t play many online games, but still.)
---
Because their different Guns boom
---
25xp is absolutely nothing. Each ghoul kill gives me around 200xp.
---
Get off the bunker so SBQ can land = RACISM
---
Are you doing okay?
---
Why tf would a I drop a shovel
---
Working fine for me. 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
No shame. Nuclear Winter SUCKS
---
Yes as long as you can find the light
---
Unfortunately there is some darkness
---
I get that people who work constantly and only have a few hours won’t have as much time and that does suck, but this season pass is honestly the easiest variant I’ve seen out of any game that has done it and while some of the items are cool most aren’t even worth grinding for aside from just having a few extra free camp items and skins. No other game has an easy rank up fast method (aside from buying ranks) for those who are always busy and while it does suck making the whole pass easy enough just for those people and everyone else to rank up 10 levels in an hour a week is also kinda unreasonable imo. These passes aren’t meant for everyone to grind out instantly within a couple hours, it’s supposed to be a “season” of earning as much as you can within your own time limits. I get the frustration but you really aren’t missing out on much and it still is a 10 week season and getting past 20 in the first week is definitely on track and not behind. You only have to earn 10 ranks or so a week after that point to get 100. I’m not arguing the same exact thing with you again, I get the frustration, but it’s not a big deal at all and I don’t know why you’re arguing for others if you don’t even care yourself. This is just so you can argue and I don’t really want any part of it.
---
Public Event system circumvent the need for talking before starting.
---
Not that these events are complex at all.
---
I added Egg Head mutation and swapped Event group over to Building. Much more XP from the Queen's adds, and when her health is down to the last bit, I change my team goal back to Event. Highest XP gained from Scorched Earth is 6k, and that was with no well-rested, food, etc, bonuses (forgot about them). I'd be curious to see how much XP is possible with all foods, magazines, perks, etc. I'm thinking easily 10k+?
---
I appreciate it, I'm on PC but that is good of you.
---
And that right there is the problem. Saying "as it was is how it will always be" and making excuses for shitty work is exactly how we end up with an all but useless ammo converter and updates that break the framerates to almost unplayable levels. "That's Bethesda for you". If we don't hold them to a higher standard then well continue to get shit wrapped in a DVD case. 
---
I've been through all of the Bethesda games that are basically the same game with different skins. I've played through all of the elder scrolls games and Fallout 3, 4 and 76. I fucking love fallout, so much so that I knew going in that I would be playing 76 well into the future and got a full year of 1st. I know, here I am bitching about their shitty business practices and horrible outdated game engine and bugs and overall lack of polish at the same time I'm handing them an extra $200+ dollars a year (my wife also has 1st) but after almost two years and all their public test servers there is NO EXCUSE for new content to release broken and buggy. 
---
I've been one of those "silly Bethesda" excuse makers for years, like "silly Bethesda, having the game just end unless you pay $20 for Broken Steel" years but I'm fucking done. If they put half, HALF of the effort they put into nickle and diming gamers into fixing the game and making sure things worked before releasing them they could go back to the glory days when Bethesda was a company you could count on.
---
West tek i think is The number one location. Another Great way of leveling is to boost your xp gain as much as you can with chems and food. Then you get your hands on a tesla rifle, a ton of fusion cells and join the events radiation rumble, scorched earth, The one at fort defiance(dont remember the name) and tag everyrhing! Otherwise high level supermutants is probably the best. They are not that tanky and give you loads of xp
---
Do you see the 500 atoms mentioned in the game? It’s weird they don’t show up on Bethesda’s seasons page.
---
Reeeee
---
I wonder exactly what causes this bug. Yesterday just for shits and giggles I stayed on during the rollover, and I literally watched as one by one the dailies disappeared until they were all gone, then one by one the new ones popped in. 
---
Nothing auto-completed for me, and I haven't had ANY auto complete at all.
---
Seems weird that it's not affecting everyone in the same way.
---
Well you will die lol. But there is very little consequence to dying. Just scrap and stash your junk regularly. Bring your camp with you early on so everything is always nearby.
---
Hope for the best and prepare for the worst :)
---
\-\_- You absolute bastard; have my +1.
---
It's not true. You get slightly more materials back when Scrapping. And it gives more Durability when Crafting.
---
It happened to me a lot before I quit playing.
---
Yes if you Click on the lvl.100 bundle
---
This would be a good compromise for everyone I think.  Great idea!
---
Destiny 2 isn't that bad atm the only 'bad season' was season of the worthy. And that's because it was to hint at upcoming content instead of giving it.
---
I do know what I said. In the mod crafting menu for the T-65, there is an option to attach a Camo Secret Service Jetpack, which you should not be able to do.
---
No you cant really team pvp because each person on one team has to shoot every other person on the other team now, and that takes a bit for everyone to become enemies with everyone else needed, so unless the pvp is 100% organized, actual team pvp isnt gonna happen, easy solution was just to make players in pacifist not be dragged into pvp with their teammates, but no, bethesda didnt give a shit
---
It is when they're using magic weapons and/or staggering her with One Gun Army.
---
#neverland
---
Seeing this makes me happy people are glitching to 100, Bethesda deserves it.
---
This isn't a fucking mobile game.
---
I get about 4k still doesn’t last long though
---
is there a way to pack your camp up or can you only move it?
---
You can leave your private server and instantly join again for everyrhing to respawn. It takes a while for The server to die after you log out so you can basicly farm it without interuptions so long as the server or game dont crash
---
I just think you are making it out to be way more difficult than it is.
---
 I have to wait in lobbies every time I do all those other stupid NW challenges.  This will be no different. 
---
I actually don't mind exploring the outskirts and hugging the fire line.  I have way more fun avoiding people than actually fighting them.
---
I've been a pistol guy across the whole Fallout series personally. I almost always use 10mm but I keep a pipe gun in .38 with me for low level stuff like radroaches and ticks. Any help would be appreciated!
---
i tried it is already gone );
---
First bush near were i've spanwn..
---
I don't like battle royale, but Bethesda forces me for some nice rewards..
---
And it goes well with the BoS bomber jacket.
---
Somehow, I managed to win the last match I was in - me and my Level 1 teammate...sometimes it pays to get lucky.
---
I have a phobia of crickets. Ill fight 3 scorch beast by my lonesome. Not badass just run gun hide repeat. I will never go in a cave alone. Mf in never!
---
ITT: I don't want to work as a team and I don't want to be told to.
---
OH thats wierd, i do this all The time when transfering items between characters. Always the same server when i log back in
---
I disabled grass entirely in my .ini file thanks to Angry Turtle, that has helped a lot.
---
I'm legit 518.
---
You sure you're playing the same game? Ants are practically made of paper and barely scrape my health and crickets may have that annoying poison DOT but they're usually flying into pieces long before they get close enough to apply it, and if they do one Stimpak usually takes care of it.
---
Hardest regular enemies in my opinion are Assaultrons and Gutsys. Assaultrons head laser is very powerful and seems to tick damage incredibly fast. Gutsys seem to have a ridiculous amount of armor penetration. If I die (and it isn't the result of not being able to react when the game freezes or lags) 9 times out of 10 it's from one of these two enemies.
---
It really is haunted...pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.
---
I haven't used pistols for PvP,  but I have noticed my Anti-Armor Shotgun performs better than my Junkies vs. Power Armor.
---
I'm not sure if any of the pistols have the Perforating Clip mod, but I think that should help a little.
---
My entire point is unless you are personally logging every SCORE award and tracking your exp you have no way of discerning a visual error from the one that doesn't record the SCORE.
---
And yes it's a bug that doesn't effect everyone.
---
What do you do to pass the time,lol.
---
I think i took too long to do it
---
Interesting. Is anything additional included at level 76? Website just says it’s just the t-65 onslaught paint.
---
He was probably cheating, but one trick for hunting bush wookies, barrel sqeep bushes, your crosshair will turn red if someones there
---
I'm writing a book on Fallout 76.
---
Not at all I enjoy the game and the season pass ,  I just want to get my dailies in as fast as possible and not have to worried about it 
---
It call playing efficient
---
It's 30% more damage against all scorched. I also had a Zealot's submachine gun and scripped it. They are always disappointing.
---
I get that way with the radscorpions! I hate them. I’ve been stung by 2 scorpions IRL. So seeing them in game I am not a fan of
---
You’ll eventually get your hands on max level weapons, which will give u more damage. Lots of stuff around the world that give your damage boosts as well, not just perks. Stuff like, chems &amp; foods, even alcohol. I’d say find those that match your build/weapon of choice &amp; consume some of you are looking for lots of damage increase on top of perks. 
---
And congrats on hitting 50+
---
Right now, aside from legendary items and buffs, a level 50 is the same as a level 500
---
Name?
---
I used to do it on the daily but one day I helped the wrong person and got constantly attacked by higher levels with builds for PvP 
---
I'm a simple guy who likes heavy guns and pve 
---
But I practically got forced outta the server by a group of trolls, I haven't really played since
---
And I dont necessarily have a huge problem with being able to pay to make up some ground, the fact that its essentially required unless you eat, drink and breathe this game for the next 3 months is just going too far IMO.
---
When you move it it packs it up into the module.
---
Maybe, well im very sorry to hear it. Remember what a pain the first nuke launch was. Sucks to have it all go down The drain
---
This game has too many bugs.
---
Wasted on alcohol quest given by BIV at big als tattoo parlor for those of you that are lost
---
No it’s just because lvl.100 is a bundle so there is multiple things in there everything else is just one item
---
Oh, I hate the gutsys. There is no reason they should be as OP as they are!
---
Probably duped, don't feel guilty, rare plans before the duped glitches were fixed are being given for free or selled by almost nothing
---
That’s going to be a pretty good profit margin on that purchase.
---
Of the book (it's two volumes so far - volume 2 is in progress):
---
Enclave Field Guide &amp; History 2102 - 2104 Volume 1 - Reclamation
---
Volume 2 will be Wastelanders
---
again sony and nintendo being left behind in the past (as they should)
---
Yeeeeeeee boiiiiiii! That’s awesome, be sure to let the low levels get a hit before you MELT EVERYTHING
---
Doing Radiation Rumble I knocked this out really quick.
---
&gt; So save your earned atoms for the later levels. 
---
That shouldn't be the required use of the Atoms that you earn this season. They *should* be so that you can buy something nice for yourself in the Atom shop. But because Bethesda made the season such a relentless grind, people will either spend the Atoms for season ranks, or burn out well before they even earn the paltry 1500 Atoms over the season.
---
It must be considered a feature since it’s been happening since the launch
---
Unless you have some OP legendary weapons and a sick armor load out I dont think you're anywhere near level 150+, in terms of damage and resiliance
---
That's interesting. Yeah, I have to remind myself that this is a pc game ported to console.
---
Wait a minute, are these "go away grenades" something different from dung pods? I played for a while when MH:W came out and always found those annoying to produce (one of the only things you couldn't make in the botanist, if I recall correctly).
---
It's a shame too, I'm old enough to have been around when EA were Kings and Bethesda came up the ranks to become one of the true greats you could always count on. Then money happened and the once great fell to greed. Like you said, Capcom is rising up from the ashes of their greedy fall and it's great to see. It just pains me to see one of my all time favorite franchises (Monster Hunter, Fallout and Rachet &amp; Clank being top three) fall so far and so hard. 
---
I can even go as far as forgiving them removing features from 4 and selling them to me separately in the atomic shop if they put even the smallest effort into making the game work properly and dealing with bugs that have been around for ages.
---
I wanna do the budget glitch, but I can't find the plan anywhere or find anyone that has one to buy. Anyone on Xbox that could help?
---
That's what I'm about to do.
---
Completely agree man, there arent really any repeatable quests that give a high XP reward that I know about, so the leveling up one ends up being me fast traveling/server hopping Whitesprings and West Tek mostly until I level up, its incredibly tedious and boring. I guess they expect you to just go around and do every event, but even some of those dont give much XP.
---
I mean people are still offering like 10k for good legendaries for it though
---
Fuuuuuuck those guys. Im a former survivalist altruistic archer. No spoilers please! My character has completed literally only wastlanders ebough to get chinese suit. I have basically a full game!
---
I digress. Im now stealth rifleman and i mess some shit up without being seen. Loving it. But scorpions and mole rats [specially high level.] Sidenote i play in 1st person wearing VR for audio (it's incredible i can pinpoint things audibly in game. But.
---
Drawback is i legit freakout when a ground dweller givea no indication then BLAM! Lol
---
Heh that's one way to look at it.
---
Thanks! I think my next focus will be better armor (Chinese Stealth or Secret Service perhaps?) and trying to collect flux, as I am hitting ceilings now with what I can craft.
---
I'm absolutely loving this game! So beautiful!
---
Good to know. Thank you. =)
---
I did. I'll be back once they add more story content.
---
so is that a Plasma pistol basically?
---
&gt;Not only did both the Monster Hunter World base game and the Iceborne expansion release in near flawless condition
---
I assume you're playing on console because the PC launch was anything BUT flawless.
---
And yet, coordination is necessary in events that require teamwork.  
---
Radiation rumble and Encrypted have like 8 min before someone activates the event to allow people to join and coordinate efforts.  
---
If you decide that it´s not necessary because you assumed that everyone knows what to do but then realize in the middle of the event that most of them do not, you lost your right to complain.
---
Cooked meat did the trick for me.
---
I got it from eating cook meat. Bloatfly, mirelurk, and some glowing.
---
I finally made it over 300, level 306 to be exact and I'm not sure, but i can tell you for each of the aholes out there, there's probably 3 good people. I give countless things away. Heck when I play on a mule character I CANNOT stop by whitesprings without someone offering me goods. I love this game
---
Same here.
---
I expected to see something sperm related tbh.
---
I wish it was one of the best :p But I loved it in Fo4, which in the lore there says it was next to power armor in terms of strength
---
Interestingly enough the XP requirements are the same from level 100 to 999 (15880). At level 1000 the requirement is much greater (159880).
---
I should be just at level 20 from the dailies today.
---
&gt;So to test things out, since i had the highest S.C.O.R.E level at the time at 40 and a few more lunchboxes i opened an extra lunchbox, and the three of us reverted back to standard gain xp.
---
Wait rank 40? On S.C.O.R.E? Either you have done the repeatable xp fordays without sleep or you have used that recent exploit I heard of.
---
Ok sweet I'm genuinely wanting everything. I may actually PTP a little. If that second stimulus gets voted in 😏
---
Wasn't it meat meals?
---
What you see in the damage is what you get with equipped buffs. You can take a perk card off and see the damage will go down
---
Cooked meat has been working for me!
---
Thats good to hear! Stay safe out there in the wasteland.
---
Yep...doing it as we speak. Honestly probably could just get in a team and loot and move around because everyone is hiding in a bush, so no real chance of being killed much.
---
However I can hide in a bush while browsing the internet.
---
Any kind of cooked meat counts as a meal.
---
I had no idea what they did at first now i want the whole game to permanently have the confetti
---
I’ve got mine doing royal taffy, glowing meat steak, charred scorchbeast, and others I can’t remember.  I can say though I haven’t done anything with vegetables so maybe it’s a bug with veggie soups?
---
From what I can tell.. this is how fallout is supposed to be played.
---
That’s very interesting 🤔
---
Go to the toxic lakebed and kill a few mirelurk and cook them. Then eat them. Done.
---
I also play with my son of the same age and have seen the same event play out. It is frustrating and heart warming at the same time. He really does keep me grounded while playing and help me remember its mostly about having fun.
---
i did the mission with the wolves, got their ribs, cooked em and it popped
---
i actually did that for yesterdays and had enough left to cover todays too lol
---
I'm pretty sure it has to have some sort of animal-based ingredient.
---
&gt; Doesn't matter if she's shielded, the vampire effect will still proc.
---
I had no idea this was the case.  Thanks for dropping some knowledge.  =)
---
Alright, i’ll try it out 👍
---
Glowing meat steak and other basic cooked meat 🍖
---
Cook up a bunch of mole rat chunks, or any type of meat and eat it. That's what works for me.
---
Screw endurance imo. Nowhere near enough hp to justify not 15str 15 agi building with the defensive perks that scale on str Nd agi. 5 end for tank is all tahts worth itj the end tree imo
---
Dung pods are go away grenades for clearing an extra monster from your fight or forcing the target monster to change locations. Handy if you're a hammer user and the fight area lacks slopes, etc. 
---
The go away grenades are for the Iceborne endgame area The Guiding Lands. At any point there are three regular monsters (or one elder and a regular monster) and they rotate in and out every five or ten minutes. One leaves and a different monster takes its place. Sometimes this would force your target to leave before the fight was over. These go away grenades cause the monster you hit with them to completely leave the guiding lands freeing up a slot so anything new has a slot available and doesn't force your target out.
---
I love this game too. Despite pumping 200+ hours and replaying the same events, I can’t stop myself from turning it on lol
---
I honestly have to agree, I seem to thrive on being forced to do something for progression even if it's kind of unnatural but with small incentives along the way to be happy about getting even if most think it's minor rewards, Im happy with little free things.  Gives me some excitement being able to complete something other than just a quest line at the end of the day
---
i hate trying to track down the shovel, but how long does a dropped item last anyway?
---
Oh my lordy lord. It's not difficult at all. I've never said it's difficult. It's time consuming. Very time consuming. How can you not see what i mean when i lay it out for you easily. 
---
The time spent doing this could be time spent doing more productive stuff.
---
I agree, having to spend an hour killing 10 ghouls and/or eating cooked foods and building 3 camps in NW its just too tedious. I'd rather be pickling up arbitrary junk for no real reason
---
You too!
---
This is true.
---
Dang, you are lucky! I haven't seen them below 3000 caps
---
The ITV's are the best resource for that info.
---
Cooked animal meat.
---
Can i just use 10k atoms and buy my way lol.
---
They should...
---
Try cook simple meat. Any meat.
---
Didn't know of this, thanks!
---
Well I do have 2 of them now plus a plethora of other rare plans I’m hoarding to see if I can ever get myself a legacy
---
I'm guessing grilled foods from cooking meat are what it means, they worked for me.
---
I agree man. It sucks to see Bethesda go deeper and deeper in to the rabbit hole. 
---
That being said, I still think their games are fun, this game included. It's just a damn shame what greed and monetization has done (for this game and the gaming community in general).
---
Eat meat. I ate 1 of every melee buff meat and i fonished it
---
Cooked meat seems to work fine. Mirelurks are easy to find at spruce knob lake (south of foundation)
---
It is the damage after perk cards. Easy way to see this is take off cards and look at numbers then put them back on and see how it changes.
---
It's better than keep on getting pylon damage long after Encrypted event is finished.
---
You are being salty in the comments, I bet you're one of *those guys*.
---
I guess I touched a sensitive fiber, huh.
---
Lol I was just dorking around the Bog when a nuke dropped and Queen showed up so I jumped on a building to avoid the horde and some jack hole followed me up there and got on mic just to tell me I was a fucking dumbass. I thought it might be about her landing but she was landing just fine and this jhole and his buddies stayed in the roof being ducks to me. So I got my tags and threw heart emotes at them til they left.
---
I don’t know if they fixed the spinning, but they are now generators. 
---
Sadly, I realized that after running out of gears. I guess it’s time to pick up some fans.
---
I've realized there's people like that in most any online game, sucks running into them, ruins everyone's experience;
---
whereas, it's quite a different experience running into veterens who are polite and helpful
---
G.E.N.E.:  Genetic Enhancement Negation Editor
---
Wow. I’m sorry, I missed it, did he not count in repeatable? Just dailies and weeklies? That would be amazing!
---
yes, the pulse capacitor drains fusion cores and turns the plasma gun into an automatic bullet hose of 300 rounds with the flamer barrel
---
Had someone critiquing another person at the Feed The People event the other day because they didn't verbally yell out what the mechanical issue was. Apparently he believed none of us were able to see the quest icon or read the quest text when it updated or those extra 5 seconds it took for us to read sure were an issue for him.
---
There's a mod for the syringer that will cause a bloatfly to spawn. Also sometimes the scorchbeast guano piles around fissure sites and Watoga contain bug parts.
---
I’m not gonna lie, I was a little irritated at first because I had JUST given them to him, but the heart warming thought of him putting others potential needs above his own changed my attitude really quickly. He’s a very giving kid. Kudos to you for raising a good one!
---
I just equip two -50% fall damage armors.
---
Lol yeah let me take over an hour out of my day to do that, how about no?
---
Here's an idea, how about you test it yourself? 'bbbut angry turtle says, angry turtle says' I watched that video, he doesn't test it with another player. 
---
In the (altered) words of Blizzard: What, do you guys not have friends??
---
its the actual damage you deal to a target without any DR/ER in range of the weapon 👍🏼
---
if you would unequip the damage perks, youd see the displayed damage go down
---
the mannequins that follow you, whisper and move when you're not looking at them, and rearrange your camp?
---
Well I never knew that.
---
Yeah man no argument there, that shit is annoying for sure.
---
I heard there is an exploit with god Mode
---
I only speak to others if they speak to me first
---
or if they don't have push to talk on and are eating and yeah I'll probably say something.
---
I really don't mind if I make it or not 
---
I got the ammo converter even doe it was a let down
---
I don't have this problem because I use my Instigating Grognak's Axe on cave crickets. They die just as fast as everything else, which is usually in a single hit.
---
Now Mirelurk Kings, those are some OP monsters right there. I am level 360 something and even with my assortment of god roll weapons I will usually run away if I hear them scream.
---
I logged in, looked at the dailies, logged out. maybe some of us need actual new content and not monotonous daily grinds. definitely time for me to move on. I wish you all luck, some of those rewards look awesome!
---
Yes but you can easily AFK for a free 250 score.
---
they might be modders or they just grind out the repeatable xp quest to an inhumane level
---
I dont get your response, I disagreed with you, and I didnt attack you. I said the way the system works is bullshit, but didnt criticize you or your comment besides saying I disagree with some of your points. But you call me a stubborn child? Not to mention, your characterization that I think we should get rank 100 with no effort, please show me where I said anything remotely like that. Your egregious exaggeration misrepresenting what I said combined with your unnecessary and unprovoked personal attacks tells me you didnt actually think this out, youre just blindly defending a bad system without seeing the whole picture or having a proper frame of reference. You really think the fact that even if you do EVERY Daily and weekly including NW from day one til the last day STILL isnt enough to get to rank 100 is a good/fair system? No other game has such an unforgiving time constraint on similar "events" or "seasons." They all have some type of "buffer" or grace period within the constraints. I mean hell, you want to talk about proportionality? They are not even consistent, lets take the recent NW event to get the Ghillie suit:
---
- It lasted about a month, but with 1 week of dedicated play, almost exclusively playing NW you could get ALL the rewards. If you only played a few rounds a day and skipped a few days, you could still get it, but it would take you near the end of the event to get everything.
---
Why would the same logic not apply here? If you do EVERY Daily and Weekly and a good amount of the repeatable for like a month, you should be able to finish the season. This allows those who cant play hours every day to still finish, theyll just have to wait til near the end of the season to get everything. The way its currently set up is you could play every day for hours, do every challenge and a fair amount of the repeatable and STILL NOT FINISH AT ALL. That is just a terrible system and puts TOO MUCH pressure on people to buy ranks. I dont mind possibly having to buy a few ranks for the convenience of being able to miss a few days, but they were just way too harsh with it, now missing a few days means spending like 2000 atoms, because if you miss a few days one week, youll be behind and it will just snowball depending on how often you miss a day.
---
This pseudo-macho bullshit in games has to die. All these wannabe e-sports pros doing it "the right way". Get a fucking job. No-one watches you on Twitch or YouTube no matter how much gamer gel you buy. Others just play for fun. Another example: I cannot imagine the horror of having to speedrun games but others get fun from it (somehow). Each to their own. Gamers are a lot more diverse these days. Those that go on about "back in the day" meaning about 5 years ago think they're some kind of battle-hardened veterans that deserve respect - no. Act like a cunt - get treated like one.
---
You can hop each fissure hunting scorchbeasts, often I get 3/7 being legendary scorchbeasts, and a chunk of xp killing them even if they're not.
---
I really haven’t run into this problem. A bunch of my friends convinced me to buy modern warfare and I was shocked at how toxic the community there can be compared to those who play 76
---
I got mine through cranberry cobbler I believe
---
You need to cook meat such as death claw, scorched beast and ect.
---

Once i heard that my competitive earned mountaintop grenade launcher was going to be obsolete due to light score I sorta checked out of D2

Who do you sell your bullion to in Foundation or crater
---
Super rare drop... chances r .02% or something like that... if u trade make sure u don’t trade for cheap.
---
Or 3 Serums ;)
---
If they haven’t turned off fill team then it’s quite selfish, but what the hell would you report them for? Unsportsmanlike like conduct?
---
Heavy weapons and small bugs suck... Especially if you use one with a spin up barrel. They die quickly, but hitting them sucks. Always carry a melee with you for things like ants and crickets.
---
That is exactly what I did! I just went around hitting them with a golf club.
---
I have run into idiot players who only want 1 thing... to fight. They well follow u and annoy you until u relent. Reason why ppl constantly keep asking Bethesda to make a pve dlc.
---
I certainly did. Sucks but I guess I'll be back to play all their new content for 1 week a year at the rate they are going.
---
FOMO is literally why Seasons exist.
---
Idk
---
Is anybody besides me going to gather iradiated ore or are we all just going to stand here killing stuff?  Stand here killing stuff huh?  Ok...
---
Oh I see. Wonder if we will get a Nuka World Arcade to use them lol
---
okay thank you. i spent a solid five looking for the button to pack it up to take with me
---
And so would increasing stash size yet I'm sitting on a box that holds unlimited scrap.
---
No your missing the point, it’s 25xp more per level of score not actually xp you gain from killing enemies. At lvl 10 you’ll have to complete one more daily worth of challenges than level one. 2 more for level 20 and by level 80 of score you have to complete all the dailies to just level once
---
hackers
---
I’m good with everything except for the radroach that shows up to scorched earth. I’ve fired at least 10,000 ultracite rounds into the dirt around my feet trying to hit that damn roach, which is also immune to bash damage.  
---
I also use dodgy and it hits so frequently I can’t even vats the bastard.
---
Bloodied limb damage Lmg can destroy her health bar in half mag. Did this many times. You need to be right in her face when she lands. Any chance she was doin the blast animation and died during it?
---
Just a regular primed fixer?  What weapon effects?
---
Congrats btw.
---
Wait I’m not suppose to stand on my tent
---
Oh, wait, you’re right.
---
I was thinking X01. 
---
Sorry,
---
That's right, so even doing it just a few times a week would be a bonus. Just playing 1-2 hours a day with a regular build, I get it once a day.
---
You completely misinterpreted my post. I'm not trying to say that we shouldn't expect the devs to polish or improve the game. I literally point out in my comment how it's obvious they have room for improvement. My point is that you're expecting them to be on the same level as a team that has far more experience, who's game is built on an engine that can actually handle what they're doing, and who's budget and team size are probably far greater than the 76 teams.
---
You mention what the real issue is. The Elder Scrolls/Fallout games have barely evolved and over the past 2 decades and it's become more and more obvious the flaws in their games. People are a lot less forgiving than they used to be. I don't think it helps that not only is it a new team handling the game, the old team has no real experience with this type of game, or how to handle the change in players attitudes. They're in uncharted waters for them struggling to stay afloat and your over here complaining that they aren't doing the backstroke. I'm not making excuses for the games issues, but I think it's best to temper your expectations and be realistic.
---
I get some people need a polished experience to enjoy the game, but if you seriously bought this game expecting or hoping for a more polished game than their past titles you're just being delusional. Looking at the facts and Bethesdas track record it was obvious this game was going to have serious issues. Anyone that doesn't understand that or can't wait through the games growing pains should just avoid it or stop playing right now. I'm pretty hopeful that the game will improve and can be the best in the series, but it isn't going to happen overnight. They're going to have to continue supporting this game for at least a couple more years probably.
---
Good one i forgot about those
---
Bug piles break down to loot
---
God mode + leader bobblehead stacking / cranberry relish stacking = insane XP per kill and you get 100 score per 10,000 XP this week.

All that stuff you typed and all I got was that you're not trying to attract children. Sounds like you won't be a top Gamer(TM) any time soon...

There is 1500 Atoms in the score season

Lol upvoted.

Thanks, I am glad you liked it. Here is the melee set up.

---
A lot of stuff that applied to the range spec applies here, so I'll just go over a few key differences.
---
**Gear:**
---
Again I am using a dense chest mod to reduce that explosive damage and if you do use that chest mod this means you can't use the pneumatic chest mod which reduces stagger from incoming melee attacks. This just means you have to be more aware of stagger and maybe block a melee attack every once and awhile.
---
For my arms, I was using the strengthened mod, as you need some type of reduced limb damage or else you'll get crippled limbs a lot, which also can cause stagger. In a non INT melee spec you can just use adamantium skeleton and crippling is a non-issue, but the idea behind the INT build is that we are making a trade for much faster XP gains.
---
For my legs, I was using custom-fitted mods, as with a base of 5 AGI and 3 END, I felt I needed some help with long-distance sprinting. Between the mods and the marathoner, you can sprint for long distances. Another option would be to farm and craft Razorgrain flour and use that for an AP boost.
---
For a weapon I recommend unarmed, it is just so much better than one-handed or two-handed. However, anything bloodied faster swing speed is just going to wreck everything. Those weapons are just really strong. With the ideal weapon being a bloodied faster swing speed unarmed weapon. But, just use the strongest melee weapon you have, melee does a ton of damage, so you don't have to worry about doing max damage with it.
---
In this version I am using the refrigerated backpack mod.
---
**Mutations:**
---
My suggested mutations are in the Build Planner. Since this build does use Class Freak you can use a lot of mutations without a big downside. I do suggest that you be a plant eater, and not a meat eater. I know that there are meat food items that greatly buff melee damage, but for 99% of the game content that is just overkill and hunting scorchbeast brains for that int buff as a melee is going to be much more work than a range spec.
---
**Perks:**
---
If you look in the build planner you'll notice I have heavy gunner perks listed as well, and that is because with a few perk changes you swap over to heavy guns. This is a type of versatility you don't get in the range build. I like having this option there and it is very useful to change to heavy gunner if you have to fight the Queen in a nuke zone.
---
**Other Notes:**
---
Since you are melee and this is not a stealth build that means you have to fight some nasty mobs toe to toe. So with that in mind, I recommend the use of psychobuff instead of fury. Psychobuff will make you noticeably tankier and give extra damage.
---
For the Queen outside of a nuke zone, just run in, get your hits and get out. You'll do so much damage you only need to hit her a few times to get your credit. If she is in a nuke zone, pull out your power armor and use that heavy gun, or I suppose you could also use a two-handed melee weapon, but without unyielding armor your melee attacks will be doing a lot less damage.
---
For strong melee mobs use your blocks, they really help, but don't block if you can just kill the mob before it can attack.
---
For the imposter sheepsquatch remove your rads and just go full life or half-life. You'll still hit hard enough to get credit,
---
For gustys, use a psychobuff and a hit and run attack style using the terrain to your advantage.
---
Of the two builds, the melee is harder to play, but it can be a lot of fun. One thing I do like about these int builds is that they are a bit more challenging to play which I think makes the game more interesting,
---
Nice find! I found a raven mask for 90 caps :)
---
Why cant you understand that adventure pvp and nuclear winter pvp are very different from each other, please dont act like its the same thing. Pvp in adventure and nw pvp dont appeal to the same audience. And why is it that a lot of people act like pvpers are bad people? Only a small amount of people do what is the post, not the majority
---
I think I might go back, one thing I always disliked was how little atoms you get from challenges
---
Just did it a minute ago. Used corn soup. Don't know what to tell you.
---
Alrex on twitch is over 2k
---
It shouldnt be a money thing, scrap boxes are damn near essential
---
I honestly couldnt care less about missing destiny's season pass content. If you don't like it don't pay for it. I got the shadowkeep deluxe edition and was disappointment with the direction the game went so I stopped playing, not used circlejerk acronyms and complained about it. Haven't looked back since. FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) is such a dumb thing to care about. It's like being mad you couldn't be at fasnacht for fallout. When you come back there will be more virtual toys to get and they will more than likely add ways to get some of them in the future.  
---
Besides F76 has much bigger problems than muh fomo like the litany of bugs infesting the game.
---
Back in fastnacht I sold my raven for 25k and a bloodied handmade then went to the next fastnacht after followed a guy that had one around traded with him he had 2 of them and sold me the extra for 1200 lol
---
FYI, “it’s only downhill from there” implies that the hard part is over, and it’ll be much simpler from there on out. Just thought you should know.
---
God mode glitched the legendary run
---
Bloodied fixer with 50 crit damage. But, crit damage isn't working at the moment
---
You could have just added/removed cards to check
---
I honestly have no idea how you are taking "hours" to do the daily challenges. You are doing something seriously wrong.
---
Indeed. How is including mandatory challenges in NW improving the quality for those who enjoy this game mode? I hate it. Yes I'm shit at it of course otherwise I'd love it. But I didn't buy Fortnite Apocalypse I bought FO76 or so I thought.
---
18. Though I haven’t been focusing on dailies. I’ve been leveling up like crazy so the xp challenge makes up for it
---
Bivs daily.  Fucker wont give me that recipe on my commando junkies toon =\.
---
Hmm.  Glowing fungus soup worked for me... yesterday?
---
Had some still good Deathclaw meat from killing one right before I logged off last night, and today, I ran across a bunch of mongrels between WS and new Gad.
---
Made 4 mutt chops and one deathclaw steak.  
---
That worked for todays challenge.
---
Nice try Todd
---
A 60 dollar game, and for people like me who bought the Tricentenial edition 80 dollars shouldnt have microtransactions, sure cosmetics yeah, but they monetized it so heavily that it wasnt fun.
---
Yes. And sadly now u get less. (tho i saw some challenges beeing add with atoms but don't quote me on that)
---
But at the end. You get cool stuff now. For free basically. You just need to work for it. Cuz only the sun rises for free lmao
---
Hold on to those feeling man.  Cause it ends quick if ur a hardcore player.
---
Ohhh thanks Ill delete this post then
---
It seems... finicky. I know, big shock. As far as I can tell, it has to be a meal you have cooked by yourself not purchased or looted, and even then a handful of “simple” recipes are not counting. Glowing steak and roasted mirelurk would not work for me, but silt bean soup did. It also seems any drinks like mutfruit juice or the various teas will not count.
---
Yeah fair, I had a shop so I've got a decent cap flow since vendors are back finally. I might go back whenever I'm not playing Overwatch, Minecraft, or Red Dead with the bois
---
Fallout 1 doesnt do anything with this, it makes it worse.
---
God mode xp exploit. So heres another grind where you can just cheat and bethesda wont do a fkn thing and were supposed to play legit?!
---
Sometimes ya gotta kill whatever is there and wait for the respawn.
---
I wouldn't have a problem with them if they didn't have rapid fire weapons. If you're going to throw dozens of the bastards at me and give them 99.9% armor penetration at least make them fire slow enough that I can try to react to the damage.  We need more tough enemies, but high-damage-rapid-fire attacks like the Gutsys have just feel cheap to go up against.
---
It’s pretty easy to get revives if you play nw - just stick around team mates. How I got that one.
---
I hear this alot, it would appear the longer you play it the more you hate it 🤣
---
That might be my problem, the soups I was eating was from my Commie Collectron. If that the case then that is a simply fix of harvesting my crops and making some food
---
Likewise. I think it means we are doing an OK job of raising our future, even if they only become the greatest gamers to ever live. I count it as a win.
---
Oh damn, that probably explains why I can't build high enough, it keeps saying out of bounds for my second floor. I set the camp device on the floor then realised afterwards I could put it into the cross bit up top where the pylon meets the gantry. But I guess moving it afterwards doesn't change the original circumference or area based from the floor.
---
What really freaked me out though is when I loaded in and and 10 seconds later when I immediately ran right up the stairs there was some level 30 staring at my keypad door. I'm not sure whether to be paranoid like there are assholes out there who just want to get your stuff or if it was a coincidence and people like to check the substation out just for the deathclaw.
---
It’s looking good on the Xbox, it may just have been a bug update on ps4.
---
If I missed day one, but have done all dailies and weeklies since (-1 weekly I still have to do) what level should I be at? I’m at 15, but I feel like I’m behind still.
---
Tenderizer and Adrenaline are both bugged. The DMG increase from Gun Fu is as well but it still switches targets. I had to respec all of my points in those perks until they deliver a fix.
---
Hi! You've reached Bethesda
---
I’ve seen a few in the 900s and one over 1k. (PS4)
---
Personally I think the ammo converter should have been the first reward as well as have a some minor story related quest/mission designed around getting it that both teaches you about SCORE and how to get the points. Missed opportunities I think.
---
While we’re on the subject of missed opportunities, I also feel like the fireworks should have been a plan you use with Flare gun, as well they should have been closer to the beginning of the SCORE start too. How cool would it have been on July 4th to see a celebration of fireworks in the game by multiple people. Most people wouldn’t have grind that far yet unless they used the exploit. Another missed opportunity I guess by Bethesda in my opinion.
---
I’m glad leveling up again worked, because Bethesda support just got back to me today with the expected response. “Tool limitations” again.
---
Its not hate.  Its all that new content isn’t so new after 2 years.
---
I'm embarrassed by the amount of hours I have into this game haha
---
Cottages at WS work for this as well.
---
Well considering you've completely misunderstood my original post I don't feel so bad about misinterpreting your reply. 
---
#1. I said they should LEARN from them. As in; seeing how they handle customer satisfaction, player feedback and how/when to release and update and apply that to 76.  I did not say they should be on the same level. 
---
#2. I knew exactly what I was getting when I bought this. I had no delusions that it would be any different than it is. However,  just because they put out half finished buggy messes in the past does not mean they should continue to in the future. 
---
Now if you're not going to take the time to comprehend my initial post please refrain from replying in the future. It just wastes both of our time. Kindly stay out of the koolaid if you don't know what color it is.
---
Oh no, I mean the recent update, "The Legendary Run" lol
---
That is absolutely wrong.anyone high level can confirm this.
---
Is it true for ultracite power armor I’ll
---
Need ultracite mods to be able to mod it?
---
Fixed this... Restarted steam in Adminsitrator mode
---
How do you expect servers and continued development to be funded?
---
I was today years old when I found out that I’m not supposed to be on the building. FML. Sorry everyone.
---
I have downvoted no one in this thread. Insecure about meaningless internet points?
---
They sure know how to kelp a fan base huh
---
Glitches and hacks more then likely. Bethesda should be able to track that kind of stuff and i hope they do. I really hope they reset the score to zero for anyone found to be using exploits. As well as ban them from any future season events.
---
I bought a BE15r Fixer for 2500 Caps and a BE Laser Rifle for 2000 caps from one vendor yesterday lol
---
Of course I did. And then the queen landed. This was a couple months ago. Now I ask people to get off tents when I play. have some human decency and show some respect, but also Words can’t hurt you.
---
And my level is very very high. Way back in the day standing on building was never an issue. But I took a long break and came back to the game and get called fuckface sitting at 300 levels higher than the guy the yelling at me(could be his alt) Haha funny stuff
---
(PS4) That happened to me last night.
---
Depth of field changed, so pretty much everything beyond 3’ away was blurry.  Futzed around with the setting, didnt make any difference.
---
Server hop fixed it.
---
Oof.... that’s rough!! I hate the blood bugs that show up during scorched earth!
---
Even a simple "craftable" mannequin that has a stash weight of 10 (like the PA chassis) which could have 6 slots on it for chest, arms, legs, and head (7 if you wanted to add glasses) item would then count towards your stash limit, but also act as a display case (without taking up the 30/30 display case limit in your camp budget)
---
I had this conversation with a friend. Scorchbeats? NP. Deathclaws? Just a king dethroned now. Cave crickets? WHAT IS HITTING ME, WHERE IS IT and WHY CAN'T I HIT IT BACK?!?!
---
I play herbivore mutation and I cook every cave cricket out of spite. They were what killed me most when I was lower level.
---
FWIW, I get this too but I think this is the generic unresponsive NPC thing Wastelanders introduced. I complete it every time it pops up by spam clicking Chloe for a few seconds. Hope it works for you.
---
If you need to sit on top of anything during a SBQ fight just means you don’t know how to build a character. I’m on the ground as a bloodied build tanking everything. Grow a pair and get yer boots dirty!
---
Sometimes when i have nothing to do, i look on the map for low lvls, and prepare them a set of leather modded and pocketed, a bow, a hunting rifle, and a machete. If its lvl 5, ill craft it for lvl10, if its lvl1, for 5. Give them a choice, and something to look forward to. Also a pack of ammo for said weapons. When i did it first time, i dropped everything nice and tidy, saluted, and fast traveled out of there. Only after a while i realised that i didnt give the guy any ammo, so now i always remember.
---
You basically have one stash. Placing different kinds of boxes, lockers, safes etc. will merely share the same inventory. So not like Fallout 4, where you can categorise your items in different stashboxes
---
yes op, i noticed it too, wastelanders seemed to push back the background draw distance at least a little
---
Dang. My stash is filled and I have some stuff I want to store. 2 legendaries that are 3 levels above me.
---
Its for the daily challenges, not daily quests
---
Well done son. Well done.
---
Honestly they aren't that bad. 
---
They were horrible in 4. Seriously, I avoided that one town South of NukaWorld like a plague. I was even a level 100+ with modded armor and weapons.
---
level 50 is too low to have all the right levels of all the right perks to maximize damage, think it probably roughly takes to about 100-150 to get all of them that you really need for your liking.
---
I think it's line in the sand.
---
I’m never playing solo again. If I can’t get a public team then I server hop
---
So between autocompleteing and going away for a weekend with my family as I have said before this isn't meant for a majority of us. Most of us didn't take screenshots because we already read from other posts that nothing was being done about the bug, so without anybody high up telling us they're going to fix things on our end let's face it, we are used to just accepting it as a loss and moving on like we are used to by now. No that's not a cheap shot at this game it's just a sad truth. I love this game and it's my main game I play. Heck today I logged in and was missing most of my inventory. I didn't even freak out. I just sighed, relogged and it magically was there. Later on changing servers gone again. It's just stuff many of us are used to by now.  
---
These seasons though are just more proof (just like the ammo converter, legendary perks, daily caps on everything, and so many other examples) that the developers do not know their own player base even after all this time. Let me have a life outside this game please.. Fix bugs first. Make all challenges weekly and obviously and many more of them. Problem for many of us is solved so far as seasons are concerned.
---
I'm at 3,000+ alien rounds and counting. One day I'll grab my alien blaster off my mule I swear it! I want someone to take photos of me when I slightly irritate the queen with it.
---
And there are even more of you entitled, phony, social justice warriors, who need an excuse to hide behind instead of just saying "I deserve things free, if I whine loud enough I might get them"
---
Because if you actually cared about the ethics of putting mtx's in paid games? If that was actually even a sliver of your concern? You wouldn't complain about free shit. YOU'D STOP SUPPORTING ANY ONLINE GAME OR SERVICE as the practice is now near industry standard....
---
You'd be boycotting pretty much the entire industry, supporting consumer protection groups, writing letters to your state and federal representatives....
---
But you don't do you..... Because the practice of using MXTs in paid games is not your primary reason for being upset.
---
It's because you want what others are willing to pay for, but you don't want to pay for it.
---
Thanks, I totally misread the whole thing
---
capatown my dilly.
---
Is the future double score weekend counted in this?
---
yea we could throw some flux in there also your a good person most people would just try to get it for as cheap as possible and scam especially for someone like my who rarely ever trades and i thank you for that btw are you on ps4?
---
I always do that because it's happened to me several times.
---
Once i think it was a failed trap attempt though as the vending machines were about 10 foot over a cliff edge at seneca rocks. Which straight away had my spider sense tingling. The very second that i bought something the camp vanished. Bird bones and reduced fall damage allowed me to land half way down alive.
---
I'm giving this one my all but I won't be able to do this again. I'm fine grinding but having the SCORE come almost entirely from Dailies is terrible. It should be more in line with total hours, not every single individual day. Some days I can play 5-8 hours. Some days I can play 0. I really hate this system.
---
My ultracite Gatling laser did that. It eventually changed to it's proper form when textures were updated. 🤷‍♂️
---
This is what I do with my ally
---
As a low level I like the idea more of completing events for 100 score. It's definitely harder to hit the xp threshold for me.
---
ign? ;) I'm heavy weapons myself (+pa) but different approach
---
I just cooked up some mole rats and called it a day. I think I also had a glowing fungus soup.
---
No, I'm Xbox, are you PS4?
---
well you can't drop them or trade them. So if you want them you need the plans
---
Got it, thanks! So Bazelgeuse will still follow me around giving me love nuzzles in every other zone, no matter what I do. :)
---
I'm rank 46. It's easy, but very time consuming, to get that high without exploits if you know what you're doing. However, it takes a lot of patience (and exp buff items).
---
i think they actually meant 25 score points per level, not xp.
---
It's our job to teach and raise our children but sometimes they can remind or teach us also.  Good job Dad.
---
TitusCM  50 level
---
I made 2 encrypted 3 months ago and i looted 2 plans so i thought it's not rare so i sell them for 300 caps. A guy went to my camp and buy them directly.
---
Now when i loot something i go to fed76 before selling.
---
Please !
---
I found them tho I don’t have the plans but I have a few of them
---
Pretty much, yes. Although in Iceborne he is no longer an invader. He was replaced by the much cuter and much more annoying Banbaro.
---
17. Completed every single non NW challenge. And have played a lot. The 100 SCORE for 10,000 XP is better than nothing but not really that helpful or something you can rely on to move the needle. Especially later on.
---
Got any AA legacy lasers?
---
The entire point of this kind of system having a time limit is to encourage people to play every day to retain active users and to incentivize monetization for those people that come up short of ranks in the end.
---
Seasons don't exist to just be an eternal wellspring of free shit, they exist as marketing strategies designed to "engage" players and make a bit of money on the side.
---
I'm at the exact same mark as you. I missed the first few days and though I do play NW as I do well in it I can't complete certain dailies easily. I would love to finish this season out and want to keep going in Hope's they do something to fix the issues for those of us who had issues with autocomplete and if they ever add event scores, but I know its likely just wishful thinking.. I'm already tired of just playing every day and I can't imagine playing every day the entire year minus two weeks between seasons. God forbid holidays when people are traveling a lot, people will really see how bad this setup truly is.
---
No rifle plans that use ledgendary modules unfortunately, but they are used to craft some melee weapons and the new gauss pistol, minigun, and shotgun weapons, whose plans can be bought with gold bullion
---
thats what i love about this community
---
7/6/2020  
---
Still bugged.
---
What!?! I’m at 15! Which one should I follow? Norespawns or this?
---
If your 20 my tomorrow your on track
---
HHHHIIIIIIII!!!!!!
---
&gt; double XP weekend
---
inb4 repeatable score quest is not xp in the double weekend.
---
I'd take your ants and cave crickets any day over charred feral fucks.
---
I get what your coming from dude I agree it was annoying it is just a low level trying to learn how to do an event rather than just yelling at him inv him to a party and have him do all of the things on the list is the top right and help him get through it so the event is completed and everyone is happy
---
90% of the time I do, but sometimes I load up the xbox LFG page looking for encryptid/ project paradise etc. and it takes you to a different screen.  So I bet at some point I've switched worlds while someone was at my camp..
---
You do understand that air vehicle almost always move faster than land vehicles, right?
---
That means if they could implement vertibirds, they could implement motorcycles.
---
&gt; All these people are acting like it's some sort of mandatory activity
---
Its bethesda faut, THEY are the ones that announced this as new content, in a game i already paid for.
---
I've seen them drop off of super mutants and crowned enemies.
---
I had this issue too. What fixed it for me was making sure you have the correct device already connected (you can NOT switch from speakers to headset or headset to another headset after starting the game for some reason, sound will not work on the new device, only on the sound device that was selected when you booted up the game). 
---
After loading up the game and entering a world, go to the map and go to options. Find audio options and change voice chat (should be first option in audio) to “team” chat and exit the menu. This fixed all audio issues for me. You can feel free to swap it back if you want it on another setting. Hope this helps!
---
Takes me 1-2 shots to kill one.
---
I HAAAAAAATE CHARRRED BOIIS. They’re something not to fuck with.
---
If it's like the old bug on strangler heart, you can put the jet pack on limbs and emergency protocols on the chest. Totally worth some flux to test it out before it gets patched imo.
---
It's just a visual bug, doesn't allow you to use the jetpack.
---
Cigarette machines as you wander. Also, anywhere there’s a cafeteria or dining area for trays, plates, and utensils. Head up to see Rose. Lots of plastic in the dining area where she hangs out.
---
The t65 head comes with all mods unlocked too last time i checked.
---
Yeah i know. I was just saying if you're like 'oooh these are great' you have to get the plans or get them as a drop. 
---
They're pretty shit tbh
---
You should fix the wiki then. And go correct the guy who made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9svhak/character_levels_go_up_to_50000_according_to_game/).
---
ETA: You can see the table yourself at [nukacrypt](https://nukacrypt.com/database/json/003D2BB7).
---
Does Bethesda even have a QA department? Serious question.
---
I’ve just realized that. That’s great! I submitted a ticket complaining about there not being helmet mods. Now I feel bad.
---
try building more on it until it's so hideous it takes up the rest of your base and then decide to redo your whole base and somehow your whole new base is cooler than it was before, now do that like 50 times.
---
People need to pay attention to what's going on with this update. The lunchbox rewards you get can stack and you can pull 3 repeatable 10k exp challenges from one event if it's like line in the sand or probably more if it's monster mash. Lunchboxes +high int gear and consumes +double exp weekend are going to make the levels fly by laughably fast. I just caught up to the little dude today and I'll be chilling and saving lunchboxes and chems for the double exp weekend to knock out a ton of ranks.
---
Even then, I won't be mad if I don't make it. A lot of fallout players don't okay games that have passes like this and feel like they need to get 100% of the rewards for some reason. I like there to be a grind to stratify the cosmetics everyone has.
---
If your endurance isn't 8+, you aren't a very effective tank.
---
how do u think all of us did it
---
the mannequins in fallout have an evil history. horrible things... some are classified as objects, yet some as npcs.... i guess google it for more info. Just don't let them know that you know. 
---
(stares at mannequin through scope, mannequin winks)
---
I can give you one for free. 
---
GT?
---
It’s literally the same with code battle pass?
---
Read the post. It's a 100% organized team pvp.
---
LowlyTangent1
---
Even with a Guass Shotgun these mf cunts double down on my health faster than I could get a shot on them
---
Okay, but a lot of people don't even read the guide or look at what other people are doing. RR and PP and UF are ones that show that.
---
And I've seen people level 200+ still fence and roof sitting at the Queen, a level at which they should know better.
---
But you can use the dark matter jetpack, and it works.
---
I know, I know I should not use until I unlock it (at lvl 100 on the board), but Ill reach it later, so...
---
Well there you go.
---
Follow the wires that are attached to the sirens (they lead to a treehouse).
---
This. The kill 3 creatures was the first nw event I couldnt do.
---
Yep! What you wrote is probably my biggest criticism of Seasons. Otherwise I love it and use the challenges to take a break from the main quest lines. I actually don't find it a grind at all.
---
What is your GT?
---
So they are a new drop I guess I’ve only found them on super mutants
---
Yea the only way to destroy a cargobot is obviously running and shooting. My gripe is with it being out of range all the time in the sky and then zipping away across the map.
---
Tuesdays
---
rammadeus. I'll invite you in a few mins. just swapping stuff to an alt. 
---
My camp is near top of the world
---
Given, it is an alternate reality. But still, to suspend disbelief there has to be a grounding in reality. Realistically speaking, though, I don't see why they couldn't make cartridges that contain around 20 or so "shots", minus the powder.
---
I found a junkies ffr faster reload gatling plasma for 7k a few days ago, on PC (so it may be duped), but yeah.
---
Its always tuesday. 🙂
---
I’m Not Sure What You Mean? Is It Supposed To Be An Insult Or Something?
---
It's an unpopular opinion, but I agree with this! Weightless is useful 100% of the time because you save some carry capacity. It is often useful because sneak is improved by low-weight armor. It is sometimes useful by giving incredible stealth if you stand still.
---
Chameleon is a 'lil better for stealth combat, if that's your thing.
---
Vanguard's is a bit better defense... When you don't need extra defense....
---
Aside from unyielding, everything else is only useful in specific situations. I prefer the consistent advantage of weightless, especially as I can use power armor for tougher fights.
---
So they can be drops thanks I didn’t know that I was confused they are pretty bad I only tested to see what they looked like
---
Same here, not starting for me and I am way past finishing the quests.
---
Low LVL shouldn't be in a nuke zone with a Hazmat suite. Just saying
---
I'm at Rank 23 as of yesterday, so I think I'm well on track. And that's with skipping every NW challenge (can't do them, on PC, have mods, nope can't use Mod Manager it breaks Better Inventory).
---
Granted, I've converted to an "XP farming" build with a focus on buffing INT and keeping the bonus from Tasty Squirrel Stew high with Carnivore and Strange in Numbers.
---
that mysterious ambiguity is nightmare fuel. You should write stories
---
This is why I hope they never add text chat to the game. You know how we see threads popping up on this subreddit, praising the community, and how it's so amazing? Well, a huge part of that is that we don't have the toxic cesspool that is a text chat in a game.
---
I have my scepticisms, especially with the lunchboxes. They are just a great lot of fun and help with the seasons. But that makes them clearly the next box to be sold in the atom store. But I really want to give the seasons a try. I will be away for 2 weeks, so hardly any chance completing it.. so i reset my goal to the chicken coop and hope to get some levels more in. So far it is fun and with today’s dailies I will be level 19.  I really wish for more weekly and less daily limits and goals.. job, family, life in general take up almost all my time and logging on daily is hard to squeeze in. Donˋt think That I can keep that up after the summer. But we will see what the future holds in store.
---
This is the most wholesome story I have ever heard on this subreddit. Your son is a good kid.
---
I think it's beth trying to get people to buy the plans by giving people a taste
---
Can you change the gauss pistol into the rifle with a stock mod?
---
Large influx of content layered on top of bugs ought to improve the game.
---
yea i’m on ps4
---
Not true at all.most of the best tank cards arent even in endurance. Healtj is kind of rubbish compared to resists. Iron lad is the only worthwhile endurance perk, and ita only for non PA users. (PA sucks for tankbuilds anyway)
---
I've been doing my dailies and every event
---
I'm at 20 and I feel I'm lagging behind lmao
---
Shit, lol, I could have swore I looked into that.  Oh well, gl to you and don't let it go cheap!
---
Doesnt have any *end game* gear...complains about dying at *end game* event.
---
If you ever see the camp on the western side of watoga with windmills on a high platform. Stop on in I'll hook you both up.
---
XP buffs and the repeatable. People are much higher than that legitimately. If I stack food int buffs, rock an int builders full team and with all my armour buffs etc I can get over 500xp per super mutant kill, and raise all other stuff to a ridiculous level too really and I'm not even fully min/maxing like some. 
---
I'm just approaching 25 and I rarely play longer than an hour or two after dailies reset.
---
Fellow ore gatherer here, I always miss out on the legendary spawn as a result. There need to be extra rewards for the ore gatherers/pylons to incentivise them.
---
run forest run!!
---
Tuesday around noon est
---
nope
---
Well this game only has the 1 raid so it's not like players have to learn alot compared to other MMOs lol. I remember in Destiny raids if a player wiped twice people would just kick them from the raid group so I don't think asking players to learn two easy facts about the Queen is that hard, obviously you shouldn't berate people through game chat but this game is really pretty simple
---
Sorry if i bring bad things in here, but this post made me think of my own life, and now i just have to add to this.
---
And sorry, main language is german.
---
I had a bad childhood, my parents were addicts and they didnt teach me much about life, my mother died second when i was 17, since that day i am on my own with no Backup. But that bad start gave me that opposite mentality, sharing, helping each other out...if everybody would do, the world would be a better place. All agree? I guess...
---
But the bad thing with it, as i know nowadays, its max.10 % of the people who think and life like that.
---
I went too strong in that direction, and got used, fucked up, etc. a lot in my life, by people i never thought they would do so. And as they done it, i still couldnt believe it...when i was recovered i ran after them to give them a chance, some of them way more than once. And it took me a lot of years (im 33 now) to get a "healthy" mentality. 
---
Im still a good one, but i dont give a third chance anymore...anyone who wastes the second isnt worth it. I dont trust everybody immediately, sceptic and awareness is a must now. Some other points, post is already too long. 
---
Longer than i planned, so short ending: sure make him a good boy, but also prepare him against the other ones...too much bad people out there.
---
These damn things are just another plague in my inventory that annoys the shit out of me
---
The Little break in between is going to be what helps ease the burn out some. if it ends for another to begin with no breath time then it would be a burnout fest more than it is now for score.
---
Saw it in a Juicehead video yesterday. One of his main points that I echo is: "At least spend 5 minutes testing it while crouching aka actually playing the game. Feels really lazy/low effort that even an amateur mod maker would have been capable of fixing." Between the bugs we know of, score being broken, adrenaline still not being hotfixed, and stuff like this it surprises me we keep getting these "just dont play it if you dont like it posts".
---
Yea a big part of the game is managing your inventory. I used to horde a lot of things that I thought I might use but never did. Just get rid or sell those items, but yea it’s pretty much a grind within itself.
---
An explosive shotgun maybe
---
Grenades
---
What his real price? Just i got one a few days ago and put him into stash for future times. Want to sell it
---
Might have to add another foundation piece
---
Thank you! He would love your username btw. Legend of Zelda is his ultimate jam lol
---
Yes it does. I’ve been level grinding since beta and I’m level 1036. It takes me a solid 4 hours of doing my level up run to gain a level, and that’s with a ton of xp boosts. It’s about 120k xp per level now.
---
Sounds good, thanks!!
---
People write bots to automatically down vote threads!
---
PS4 since launch no issues here except horrible stash lag. How long have you had the ps4?  Could be a heating issue
---
I've been forced out of servers about 3 times now I just kept getting constantly hunter multiple times idk what I even do to piss off these people one time I just logged in was afking at my house and this dude shows up and just says only fa**ts build there houses here and he went about destroying everything and no matter how many times I hit him he wouldn't die it was so frustrating I've also been the target of nukes multiple times
---
You only get score for events if it is in your dailies/weeklies. the repeatable is just gain XP
---
I’m not familiar with this, where is it?
---
I wouldn't be surprised if the C.A.M.P. owner disconnected half the time
---
Unyielding builds have always known.
---
Hey noobs if you're getting low on ammo, just switch to melee weapons ya dinguses - For Your Ammo Health!!
---
Damn, I was actually looking forward to unlocking the ghillie skins to use in NW. Hope it's an oversight and they fix it at some point...
---
It's called the PTS, the problem is the entire score system wasn't included in that!
---
You'd think, but if you set up INT based the 250 points from NW are nothing compared to a few super mutant runs. Get Carnivore or Herbivore, Egghead, and Herd Mentality mutations. Get INT to at least 6. Equip Strange in Numbers, Inspirational 3, and consume Tasty Squirrel Stew and Broiled Scorchbeast Brains (if Carnivore) or Cranberry Relish and Brain Fungus Soup (if Herbivore). Join a Building team, and go farm super mutants. One run at West Tek, Huntersville, and General's Steakhouse should get you the 30,000 XP to supplant the missing 250 SCORE from not doing NW.
---
a quad explosive double barrel will be enough to get me to switch
---
What this person said. Bought it yesterday and spent ages trying to work out why I was stuck on ‘signing in’. Turned off my firewall and bam I’m in and playing all day!
---
Awesome kid you got there
---
I've hidden in the Grafton monster before and come second. Fauna is a viable strategy.
---
It's horrible that Bethesda seems to also be ignoring this one too, every person I've talked to, including me has said that they only got an automated reply from the support team and their ticket auto locked, along with a statement that they wouldn't do anything to help with missing score...
---
Xp gain is the way to get "infinite" score. Its repeatable. So just get xp bonuses to go quickly
---
I just want the Captain Cosmos suit because I think fat things are cute, and damn that PA be chonky. I'll probably have my full T-65 set done by the time I get there, and it'll be a great replacement skin.
---
Well R.I.P fallout 76 for me . Just got this back from support .
---
"Please be aware that due to tool limitations Customer Support is unable to restore lost items."
---
Kinda sucky that players are expected to get help from other players to 'fix' game breaking bugs .
---
Samuel in Foundation and the Mr Handy in Crater
---
Correct.  If you’re on PC I can install it on Excavator, T60, X01, and Ultracite.  Just need 4 violet flux, I have the rest.  For 5 more violet flux I can install the Targeting HUD on Ultracite, another valuable mod.  Don’t know calibrated shocks yet.
---
You are entitled to your own opinion, and I agree with you, but nobody is gunna listen. This bullshit has been going on with MMOs since the EverQuest days, and maybe even further. You gotta min/max, know your role, bleh-bleh-bleh. It's part of the reason I am not a huge fan of playing in groups. Rather kill shit on my own and not get shit about how I could be doing another 10 DPS more, or could tank better, heal better, whatever.
---
I love these kind of stories because this sub seems so negative most of the time. I’m lucky but I’m glad I’ve just met some nice people and not the jerks who destroy camps or steal gear.
---
People are worked up because they want to get worked up. Just look at how much energy this sub spent complaining about a bad ammo converter UI.
---
It's the exact problem I already had with the game with a new name.
---
I wouldn't have minded the rep grind so much if there were than one quest (1.5 for the raiders I suppose if you wanna get technical) for each faction. It literally became logging in once a day to do my daily 15minutes and then back out onto other things.
---
Now I say I wouldn't mind the SCORE grind so much if there were more to it. It, for the most part, once again devolves into logging in once a day for my daily challenges and then logging back out onto other things. 
---
You can do the 10k exp repeatable from what I understand but that doesn't seem like enough imo. The grind seems specifically designed to take the full 10 weeks and while I appreciate how brilliantly technical that is. Would it really have been so bad if players could grind it out in 2 weeks? Suppose that's 8 weeks of players not logging in then because what are they going to do if not grind, have fun?
---
I had one of those. also had 15% faster reload. Gave someone an absolute bargain by selling it for 7k. I knew it was worth way way way more but i felt like making someones day.
---
I got a free ammo converter. Fuck everything else.
---
This is how children should really be raised. 
---
Not spoiling them with gifts and making them entitled brats. No, No.
---
Raise them to show respect, raise them to see logic, raise them to have kindness towards everyone, and raise them to succeed in this harsh world.
---
You my friend, are doing it right. You'd make a good role model when it comes to parenting. Hats off to you
---
Good deal!  I found a vendor with the jackolantern shorts suit for 0 caps!  I made sure to sit there for a bit to be sure I didnt get any angry "give that back" messages.  I've seen people selling those for 20k..
---
Bethesda left rifle users out in the cold with the gold bullion weapon plans. There are plans for unarmed melee (gauntlet), one handed melee (cattle prod), shotgun (gauss shotgun), pistol (gauss pistol), heavy weapons (gauss minigun and plasma caster). Rifles and 2 handed got no craftable legendaries.
---
Day one had two full levels plus repeatable xp for a whole day. I dont go hard on the repeatable and I'm 21
---
Not always as the range in its viewfinder is shit and has to be dead center, if you find them you are already looking close enough to loot!
---
I'd splurge 15k+ on it no problem
---
What’s your platform
---
You only see it at the end of a match or when you die, to my knowledge.
---
Did you see the norespawns video? Am I really behind?
---
Furlough and insomnia. I've got 3 accounts past 20 lol. Full rested, food, lunchbox, perk and group buffs get you  silly amounts of xp. I mess about with weird builds and experiment a lot, hence the multiple accounts, which is paying off for once as high intelligence and charisma work wonders for it. It's going to be fun times at the double xp weekend.
---
Yea my personal experience with griefers has been pretty low. I’ve seen so many nice people helping out. Way more nice guys then griefers.
---
Fair enough, I still dropped 60$ on release, so from my personal pov it cost that much and therefore wasn't worth it, but I would agree 10-15 it's a for sure buy.
---
It's also my own fault for buying a game I knew likely had problems
---
Cola Nut and Quantums are your friend
---
Yeah that makes sense I wasn't sure if they were releasing it right after or not.
---
I hate you 😭
---
https://gph.is/22Y64bv
---
But score and XP are 2 different things
---
I’m worried that if we had less overall content it would negatively impact the player base. I think we would have a smaller player base if we had less content. 
---
A smaller player base prevents Bethesda from making anymore money off this game, thus they would let it die. We should be thankful for the buggy content because that’s Bethesda showing us that they still care about this game.
---
I’m at lvl 22. I keep consuming XP buffs and joining public teams to gain even more XP buffs. Have an ally at my camp and sleep at camp to earn the kindred spirit bonus. Use lunchboxes when I have them. 
---
I like to join event public teams and just fly around the map doing events. Doing so also completes the XP repeatable multiple times.
---
Lol I'm at level 5 sooooo
---
As a heavy PA build I didn't really have much other use for anything in Agility I wasn't already using (thruhiker) so I'm just letting the 5 points go completely to waste at the moment. I'm considering reducing it to rank 1 and maybe upping charisma or finally taking starched genes (as popular as it is, I've never really used it much).
---
There are people ahead of you bc they are gaining xp like crazy. But I dont think you're behind. Be sure to play as much as possible during the double score days.
---
I'll hit 20 today once I do all the dailies and one round of Repeatable XP. I always make sure to be on an Events Public Team (as full as can be), I do as many events as possible (not just public events), and I try to get at least 3 or 4 repeatables every day. 
---
Even the +5%xp sleep bonus helps.
---
People still offer 6-10k caps or a good not god like but good legendary
---
I'm no sure you realise how much that gun goes for. Just a 2* quad explosive can go for about 25k. Add in faster reload and it's probably worth double. 
---
or you do realise :p
---
Just do a bit of tinkering my friend. It's fairly easy honestly. It was easier for me as I was already a bloodied/unyielding build which helps INT, but mutations, teams, and a nice broiled Scorchbeast brain really help it along.
---
Yeah that's the thing the nice part of the community is amazing but the toxic part is evil
---
I think that's happening often as a glitch
---
Real question, what is the going rate on these?
---
Ok,im gonna try thanks for your help and thanks for the help from all of you,thats a really nice community.
---
Mmm good one yeah you put me on the spot there my bad man.
---
Yeah true and just to make it worse i bet they were adults as well.
---
Not OP, but, I avoid it for several reasons. To me FO76 is the newest fallout game that happens to also be a multiplayer game so I treat it like I’m a solo player. I feel kind of stupid talking to strangers alone since I play once the kids and wife are asleep. I also don’t like the aspect of gamer culture where it’s on to carelessly call each other offensive names - I’m playing to relax not get worked up over bullshit.
---
What he’s trying to say is within each individual challenge like for example do 5 events with a team. Once you’ve got 3 out of 5 events the game will complete that challenge for some reason. You are getting the score earlier and so if you do actually complete all 5 it will seem like you didn’t get any score but you did the game gave it to you before you actually completed it because it is bugged out. This can happen with any of the weekly challenges.
---
Yeah I usually follow the instructions the game gives me instead of people around me. I get they want it to be efficent I guess? But I'm just tryna get loot.
---
Agreed. Ther only cool stuff is at the end but the grind is just too large. Not worth it. I got to lvl 5 or 6 and im over it.
---
Honestly, for how long it takes to get, give it a unique effect, like Enemies can't penetrate your Armor. I shouldn't have the best Power Armor in the game and have to run around Colonel Gutsys and Mirelurk Queens like a Hyperactive Cockroach.
---
have not done my dailies for today, missed a few NW dailies as well but I am at 18 or 19. I . Farm. XP. 10k XP is nothing with a 25% bonus to events or legendaries. and 4 INT isn't bad either but I'm already in full unyielding and have enough canned meat stew to feed an army, plus some berry 'tats to boot. 
---
In short, if you are struggling, look for a guide on YT, there are plenty out there.
---
Inventory Lag is real. Been going on since I can remember.
---
Redeploy camp lol
---
100 XP = 1 S.C.O.R.E.
---
I'd pay 30k caps, it's worth it
---
Since 2014
---
while the season wouldnt have a time limit, players still do. I'm sure once the seasons start piling up and people see rewards they are no where close too earning, they may spend.
---
Yes, they're waiting until tomorrow because it's Tuesday, which is when the new stuff comes out.
---
Pleasant Valley tickets give fancy weapons? All I get is clothes
---
People who are only there to solo legendries in order to hoard the gear that is dropped are by far the most toxic players. These people deserve all the negative shit they get. Being a high level who keeps the nightstalker from being seen by lower levels and thus allowing yourself to take the loot doesnt make you a better player. it would be nice if during events, there were no legendary creatures. you get your item as a reward for completion.
---
So you think that the second you get on the mic people are just going to start insulting you just because? If you pay attention to this sub you'd see that this community is one if the nicest communities in gaming.
---
Yes it is connected. I used to keep every note there was until I noticed the molasses transition on windows. Ditched them and it loads more quickly and it's much smoother. My original main is kind of screwed because it some how managed to get 100s of misc items  I can't ditch now and the inventory is always slow.
---
You would be correct.  Top right corner when you die. And thats nw level only. Doesnt show you adventure levels.
---
Radiation Rumble Ghouls also
---
I figured the option to spend atoms will still be there. When there are a load of rewards that more casual players are no where near earning, they may spend.
---
Yup. I'm a melee build, so that shotgun is the only ranged weapon I carry (gods bless the dev of Perk Loadout Manager which makes switching from unarmed to one-handed to two-handed to shotgun a matter of a few keystrokes). Only had one drop in almost 200 levels, plus a half dozen western outfits which have all gone into my vendors.
---
Probably wanted a 24hr timer but didn't want to punish people by having the timers drift later if they don't get on at the exact minute that it rolls over (e.g. 1230pm on day1, 1245pm on day 2, 1pm on day 3, etc).
---
They do indeed eat extra ammo/slashes/punches but if you are having too much of an issue you can pop in that perk card under perception to ignore insect armor, it's effective against the giant bug that spits acid usually in the mire ponds
---
crickets die really fast if you break their legs one at a time .. 1 to 2 shots and keep moving on to another part to break .. they're close together so they're easier than the ants ..
---
the ants are mainly a pain cause of their size and they seem to clip through me and keep going behind me cause me to spin around trying to aim at em again ..
---
yeah those buggers can be a pain .. but once you break some limbs shoot them in the face
---
Are you ahead or am I behind?
---
They added a couple of extra shovels inside the museum now, as well as one near another grave.
---
I can't find the link to the chart i saw a few days ago but it showed what days these events were on. I know x2 xp is on the 16th - 20th july but what days is the double s.c.o.r.e on and the purveyor sale?
---
What about getting ally daily quests through the terminal for any that we've unlocked?  Like a pen pal instead of needing to have them at the camp.
---
I do not think you are an idiot, but I do think that this line of reasoning is silly. The issue is not that the transaction is technically fair (its not), the issue is that after conditioning the user-base for obscenely high prices of atom items (not to mention stuff like the leather ghillie that is currently broken that you get from this season pass), in addition to a poorly planned and poorly received monthly subscription (that ended up being a massive success for them), why now is a season pass worth 100 dollars in addition to launching with some severe bugs that as of this post have not been hotfixed and not adding significant playable content? Not to mention everything else they have done that has abused the good faith of the community combined with their absolutely atrocious understanding of their own playerbase? (we were surprised nobody wanted pvp etc).
---
It all goes beyond simple yes this is fair deal with it and no this is not fair fuck them. You need to look at the macro.
---
edit: forgot adrenaline and ammo converter.
---
Damn that’s sad considering we can change some of the pistols into rifles
---
Hell I just hit 34 lol
---
An I’m not even doing the NW quest but using  the repeatable quest to fill the missing score but I’ve done it a loooooot to get this far
---
Literally on their roadmap they released a month or so ago. We should get it later this year.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/ko/article/fPSas0ftnlgD0FcZNnMoL/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-introducing-the-2020-roadmap-and-76-seasons
---
I ve watched the video and havent found the part where he proves that LW doesnt work in a team. Could you give me the timecode? I dont want to annoy you, I just want to know, because I want to reduce my charisma to 1 if it really doesnt work in a team.
---
I have as well, I think she really hates being Cryolated.
---
I still don't know what caused it.
---
I had it like a month after playing on launch. It might me microsoft (because i have had this before)
---
30 here :)
---
Yea I’m not confident I’ll get it any time soon either. I haven’t done it in a while but I started again last night and got one I already know. Gonna keep an eye out at player vendors
---
They are "Legacy" now and no longer drop in the game. It is possible to trade for them over in the market sub-reddit, but it isn't going to be cheap!
---
That’s my issue with ants... they clip into the textures all the time!
---
They are legency items.. They used to drop when the game came out but were removed from the drop pool. The only way to get one now to to trade for one. They are very rare and very expensive.
---
Edit: By very expensive I mean their worth is in the hundreds of caps. Because of the 30k "cap" on caps these items are often traded for other suoer rare items or a bundle of items.
---
I mean I’m not mad about it,  I’m like you, I just stepped away and stopped playing. Regardless of your opinion on FOMO, I think it’s pretty obvious that Bungie did their darndest to make the game a grind fest unless you want to miss the content that literally goes away at the end of the season, I.e. the dungeon that they hyped up in every bit of press that will literally be taken away for few months.
---
ahahah im selling mine for 15K
---
Speaking for myself, I'll just take what a get for free for my play time and be done, making the rest of the content meaningless if you are unwilling to endlessly grind. What I propose would still be an endless grind, but would reward earlier players while building a huge store of grindable content that is impossible to complete simply from the grind for many players, leading to spending. This would also keep content they work on in the game rather than scrapping it after the season.
---
Ok, but can I tell a lvl 300 "get of your tent jackass" in the midle of a SBQ fight?
---
Ive had the lads turn around on it. There was/is a free promotion where u can try it for free so if its still going. Now is there chance
---
3000? Usually I find them at 15k, cheapest the other day was 9. If I can find it for 3 I’ll take it.
---
2 days in ... Level 12 ... It's pretty easy
---
Just rename the custom.ini to anything else before playing NW, when you are done change the name back.
---
Thats a mega bruh moment
---
Exactly how do you craft legendary armor other than secret service armor, which can't be traded.
---
You sir. Made my day
---
Just sit back and look at the bigger picture and try not to fall for that "fear of missing out" shite. It's just skins and junk that you don't need. It doesn't make the game anymore fun if you have a skin for your PA. Stop letting the game play you and just turn it off lmao
---
You probably just built where he wanted to build and he was being a dick about it.
---
I've had voice chat disabled since the first week after hearing what I assume was some streamer running around Flatwoods randomly saying things like "show me your t!ts"
---
And now I get what your talking about and damn that sucks as I was figuring that would be easy to hit with as much as we play NW as 2 wins is like 10k XP.  Dang, hopefully just an oversight. 
---
I got screwed out of score for 2 of the weeklys where it didn’t register so lost that 2K ooof.
---
See I was thinking the same thing as well
---
The jackass part is unnecesary. Don't naturalize agression, is nasty.
---
For me I got the score points for both of those challenges when they completed to 3/5, not at 5/5. I've been tracking my score and can confirm that I did get the points for both of those even though they didn't award at 5/5.
---
The amount of different items you have in your inventory and stash directly affects the performance of the menus. If you have several hundred weapons and armors it will become borderline unusable on a console.
---
Ive wached the video, havent found the part where he proves that LW doesnt work in a team.
---
However I've tried to test it myself too, because I want to go with charisma 1 if it wouldnt work in a team so I need to know it. :)
---
My testing so far got me to an 100% safe conclusion that the AP refresh part of LW doesnt work in a team. Normally one would say that the chance that the DR part does work would be low then, if it wasnt a bethesda game.
---
If the DR part would actually work, theres no way around of Charisma 5, 4 for LW, one for Strange in Numbers. My question is: Did you test it against monsters too or just in a pvp situation?
---
My own testing against monsters doesnt work out, I'm getting inconsistent numbers. I must do something wrong, or sentinel, yeah while writing it, for a proper test I have to remove my sentinel armor. :)
---
damn you should be a lawyer
---
I opened 4 lunch boxes with a team mate and went scorchbeast hunting with 100% XP. Over 1000xp per SB to get me up a level. 
---
Whitesprings for the Ghouls.
---
I think the point isn't that the game is broken and buggy, its the fact that they insult us with stupid shit. For instance, the ammo converter and legendary perks. They removed them because they were useless, uneventful and the perk coin system was insulting. They need to use common sense and release stuff that isn't going to insult our intelligence.
---
Disagree. Some do it extremely well as it takes us like 10 mins to find the Wookiee’s at the very end to win the match 😂
---
That was the thought process. Keeping players around is a valuable currency as well. Then later down the road, new players will see a wall of earnable content and choices to be made behind a massive grind, possibly leading to spending.
---
Yeah I've gotta trade my soul
---
Interesting I am at 19. Maybe that happened to me but I have been getting a lot of repeatable gain XP and I skipped a few early NW ones.
---
nice, so you finally looked up a youtube tutorial. can't imagine the struggle that was.
---
IMHO its the correct way to do it. Why put effort into content that will simply vanish, when you can keep adding to it, making the game larger and building a backlog of cosmetic purchases.
---
For me the scrip limit has been and will probably continue to be the most frustrating aspect of Bethesda's unshakable commitment to time gating. I know how two wastelanders endgame characters I'm to grind for and honestly it's so demoralizing I haven't been bothering with it. As for this season stuff, eh, I'm definitely not going to play every day and I'm definitely not going to give them any money to buy levels. I'll get what I can get.
---
That’s 2 matches if you last till the top 10 or deeper.
---
Wait did that work
---
I'm on pace, so you're behind that.
---
I know, but this should not be the case.
---
I'm level 527. No xp glitches. 
---
76 is the only game I play.
---
No one is debating that, it's the time value of money. I'm not going to spend 12 hours a day on a video game.
---
I'm also bloodied and unyielding. I use cranberry relish and build team. But I don't see how I can pop out 600 exp per mutant kill lmao. I have low int tho..
---
Are you sure? Did you watch norespawns’s video? Says that you just need to do Dailies and Weeklies.
---
It’s happened to me like 5 or so times. I went to white springs bunker and it fixed it inside, but as soon as I fast traveled it went back the black. Ugh
---
Think weekly repeatable score will stay the same the whole season? I heard it might change to events tomorrow. Meaning every week will be a different repeatable score challenge. Just a heads up to grind xp now just in case ;)
---
If it makes you feel better all the guass guns have expoding shots. This includes the guass rifle, pistol, shotgun, and minigun. They take 2mm through.
---
Turns out my whole team of randoms is doing the same thing. 9 minutes so far.
---
I also help.imma ranger. Ign.NVRanger74
---
I agree, this sunsetting stuff is bullshit. I played for an hour the other day just to do the new quest then quit when creepy uncle drifter fed me his weekly repeatable quest dialogue. Miss me with that boring repetitive bull.
---
Depends on the receiver. Semi uses rifleman, automatic uses commando. Like other rifles. 
---
 It doesn't need a boost, it actually has a higher base damage than the handmade.
---
So you think its best to invest in content that will simply vanish, rather than keeping it around for long term incentive to grind as well as cashing in on future purchases that wouldnt exist with the current system? That sounds awful zoomer of you.
---
Thanks, although TBH I don't really need to since I can easily earn 30K XP and get the same amount of SCORE just farming super mutants. Like I said, I'm Rank 23 right now, so I'm well ahead of schedule.
---
Ive just hit the level for the metal ghillie skin. And ive had a few days off from grinding the repeatable
---
This really is a fucking waste of my time, Beth.
---
Damn
---
Some one, not from my team, just blindly ran past me. That was close.
---
no. i didn’t say you’d be a good lawyer 😂
---
Great name.
---
Literally any good stories with different types of long missions would be welcomed by me, I think we have enough things to grind by now so I really hope they don’t make another reputation grind, I don’t even care if that means less new items in game. Dungeon type runs would be pretty fun too
---
Yup. They also give both western outfits. I got lucky and both back to back.
---
Are you ahead or behind? I haven’t done the repeatable at all, and according to norespawns, I don’t have to. Have you seen his video?
---
I understand that Prime receivers are +35% (Up from the release value of 25%) - Zealots legendary effect is 30%, and the two effects stack makes for a very solid SBQ weapon while you wait for a "Meta drop"
---
I really wouldn't worry about it friend. Think about what it will take to clear the board without buying levels. Daily log in, pretty much every single day, for 10 weeks. That means no unexpected commitments, no time away from the PC or XBox, just 76 every single day for, what, an hour or two at least? Jesus even during the pandemic I've got better prospects than that LOL and you are correct, this stuff, or at least the equivalent (looking at you, secret fireplace door) is going to be in the atom shop very soon after the season ends. Just live your life.
---
It shares mods with the combat rifle, so you can scrap those to learn them :)
---
Someone just launched a nuke on my position. Just made it out. That was close. 12 minutes.
---
Hit up some good farming spots like Westek, Huntersville, the Mirelurk pond south of Watoga (sometimes the queen is legendary), etc. You can do events that have guaranteed lego spawns like Uranium Fever, One Long Night? (the one with the sons of dane compound) or SBQ like you said. It's doable.
---
Like he said above. Depending if you are semi automatic or automatic? Rifleman or commando. As well as tank killer.
---
Exactly. It only makes it more enticing to newcomers if everything is still available. The only people BPs currently market to, are pathetically selfish people who feel the need to gate-keep new players, and to stand out against people who actually have more skill in the game.
---
For real! At that point just join a private world and run the events solo
---
That's because most gamers on 76 just want to be dropped off on top of the mountain, and most get all butthurt about paying for items. I like the option because I work a lot, and it's nice to just pay for some of the cool stuff without having to spend 12 hours a day to "earn" it. More options is the best option.
---
I haven't watched any vids on 76 seasons yet.
---
Im under the impression that im a little ahead
---
..can you even get +1 strength on a ranged weapon?
---
Pretty sure you only get perception or agility.
---
It’s automatic if you have an automatic receiver on it. If you don’t, it’s a rifleman. 
---
Scrap combat rifles to learn the mods.
---
Great news! Just give Bethesda money and it can all be yours
---
I completely agree with you, I never use combat rifles because fixers are the same but better. It’s a real shame :/
---
Switch from 5 points of adrenaline to 2 points for revenant and 3 points for mysterious stranger for a chance to get +50% dmg on rez.
---
I love those boxes. We did a glitched line in the sand with two popped. XP heaven.
---
You better believe they're gonna start pumping out a ton of new stuff in the Atom shop. Since you'll only be earning, at most, 1500 Atoms from the season, you'll *have* to spend money to get the newest stuff. 
---
It's by design, because they want us spending more money on the game.
---
10K.
---
You were never ment to get score when you finish each event. What they were referring to was the daily and weekly challenges that required you to complete events.  The only way to constantly get score besides the daily and weekly challenges is the recurring weekly challenge  that gives 100 score evey 10,000 exp earned.
---
Basically when you die and server hop it’ll jack up your Unyielding stats even higher. I call it grenade hopping because I hop on a grenade down myself and hop servers.
---
Both guides are not mutual exclusive, is just that Norespawns is using 11 weeks instead of 10. The thing is that Bethesda hasn't said when the season is going to end, we may get either: 1 week without  challenges or 1 extra week of this season.
---
The official Bethesda statement so far is 10 weeks, this guide is using that number, but what no respawn says is probably what is going to end happening.
---
Use this guide as the worst case scenario one, you are not that far behind, so it should be easy for you to get to 100 .
---
It uses combat rifle mods. If you need to learn mods, just craft combat rifles and scrap them to learn the mods. If you put automatic receiver on it, it uses commando perks. If semi-auto then it uses rifleman perks.
---
If you get the plan for it from the Encryptid event or from a player vendor, then you can make level 50 ones and you have a chance for them to drop as legendary from the purveyor.
---
Those things are just nice. My son who is only 4 yo started playing games too and it is amazing how fast he has acquired coordination to play. I don't play with him much since he likes some fighting games and some boring ones for kids, but soon he will start playing those good games I like too.
---
There are 15 of us left, 4 in my little team of bush wookies. Proud of these guys. 13 minutes. Probably going to need another match to finish this.
---
Glass half-full: maybe Fallout 76 will be a wake-up call, and we'll get a better game in the future as a result of what they've learned.
---
The Mistress of Mystery storyline really got me so I’d love to see development of them, I know probably not everyone’s priority but a bunch of sneaky assassins running around would be fun for much later updates. Also better roofing, the roofing is gross.
---
10k on average
---
Nope, hard work and experimentation. But thanks for the negative vibe 👍
---
Look at the repeatable challenge and try again.
---
Nah not on PC thanks for the gesture tho
---
I did read the post, you brought the idea that you can still team pvp if each person in the group initiates with the other group, which the op already understands, he was complaining about how getting everyone initiated and keeping everyone initiated is a chore even in a 100% organized team. And then you brought up the idea that workshops are still pvp zones, which clearly shows you arent up to date with how workshops work post patch 20, your teammates cant help defend your workshop if someone else trys to contest it
---
Lmao I love the live updates
---
Then you're the reason it would take 12 hours a day to even be on par with someone who pays for the short cut.
---
You called bs on the guy that you assumed was a lowlife... debate or not I simply gave you a possibility that most smart rich people do carefully spend money then throwing it into a video game.
---
I mean, while you are working on season 3 or 4 casual players may still be on season 1. Or maybe they went 20 deep into season 1 then decide to grind season 3. The point is exclusivity alongside player choice and variety While the never ending grind and pretty things people dont have time to earn will lead to spending. Not to mention, after a season is removed there is 0 spending in regards to that season.
---
Missing a whole day will set you back more than 1 level
---
Yep, I missed some events and I'm still at level 22, is really not that hard to do.
---
It’s only a matter of time before my kid will be beating me in mariokart. I’m not mentally or emotionally ready for that day to come lol
---
Indeed. And Fallout games are perfect to teach his kid that. Not everything is flowers and rainbows but there are good people out there.
---
I mean it's not like they already announced the next two seasons in a roadmap or anything.
---
15 minutes in - half way. All 4 of us are still alive but that circle is getting small! Oh no, we have to move again.
---
It took me two hours in two days to get to level 4. I guess it’s not that hard to progress.
---
On one hand I get that sometimes they do just wanna help when they show up.  I'm nearly level 100 and I mostly hang back and watch over the lower levels,  only shooting when they seem to be overwhelmed or taking damage when reloading. 
---
On the other hand,  I have seen those jerks who just hoard the exp for themselves by killing everything before anybody has a chance to take action. 
---
Especially in the Mama Dolce quest. Do you really need those soups for the 5% exp boost, mr. level 457? More than the group of 6 people ranged from level 5 to 25? Lol
---
I traded my leather coat for a b/25/25 fixer.  It’s very valuable to the right player.
---
Well that math is wrong. You will need to earn some XP, though likely you’ll get that anyway from playing.
---
The average is about 450/500 for me I guess, but the big overlord boys at west tek etc can give you close to 700 each as well as legendaries etc. 
---
The int buff foods are a bit of a chore for me personally, as I never really bothered with it all before this as I got on fine without it, but I usually just pop one before I'm about to do an XP farm route, like huntersville, west tek, charleston capitol, maybe with an endless hoarde event thrown in for good measure like radiation rumble or line in the sand bugged so they all spawn in the middle.
---
If you time it riight you can literally pop an int buff, maybe get well rested/well tuned/lunchbox etc and farm easily 5 level up SCORE XP rewards in about half an hour- and I guess that's still slow to some people as I'm definitely not doing stuff like that most the time and just rely on my INT and the group multiplier to do my work.
---
2/3 Score reward level ups on the board a day is what I aim for and after that I don't really try anymore heh.
---
If you know your weapon kills everything with 2 shots shoot it once and back the F@$&amp; up. I hate playing uranium and some asshat kills the supervisor on purpose before any1 else even gets a chance. Only time I do anything now because of selfish jerk offs is late at night when it’s usually just me and I get all 3 and 30 something glowing meat to sell clears out over half that daily 1400 cap limit real quick be the guns I grab do the rest.
---
So, is it okay if I’m just doing dailies and weeklies? I haven’t even done the repeatable at all.
---
Typing your response in big bold letters doesn't illustrate your point any better or make it more valid. 
---
I fully understood your post. I just disagree with the premise completely though. All you did was list a few examples of when the MH:W dev team listened to player feedback. Guess what, I could do the exact same for the 76 dev team. In no particular order we have:
---
*The TSE nerf.
---
*Increased stash and camp budget.
---
*Backpacks.
---
*Alcohol Brewing.
---
*An ammo converter + the devs responded to the criticism very soon after release and are making changes to it in a future patch.
---
*Repair kits.
---
*Removal of food debuffs.
---
I could go on but I think I made my point. The dev team of 76 is definitely listening to player feedback and tries to accommodate them. The 76 team could try to look at how the MH team handles players problems, but I don't think it's as simple as you think it is. MH:W and 76 are both multiplayer online games with an emphasis on grinding loot, but that's about where the similarities stop. The games are completely different and the same approach and solutions that may work perfectly well in MH:W may not even be possible in 76.
---
I don't know the size of the 76 dev team, but it's been assumed for a long time by many that it's a pretty small team. Bethesda usually uses smaller teams for their games than most triple A titles and this one is certainly no different. The MH:W dev team has somewhere around 300 people on it. That's 3x as many people as Bethesda had working on freaking Skyrim. 76 is definitely being run by a smaller team than that. Do you really think it's reasonable to expect the 76 team to be able to push updates as quickly or with as much polish as the MH:W team could? You really can't expect a team that's a fraction of the size of the MH:W team to be able to work the same way. It also means that the 76 team has far less man power to split between working on things already in the pipeline and new changes requested by the players.
---
You really don't think you actually knew what you were getting when you bought this game if you think that it would ever improve to the point that it was practically bug free. Anyone who has even the most basic understanding of how poor the Creation Engine is knew that this game was going to be fundamentally flawed and would never be in a nearly bug free state. Before this game released we already knew it was going to run terribly, even Bethesda admitted so. Bethesda has been releasing games like this for almost 20 years and they've all been huge successes. This is the first time the glaring issues in their game have actually caused it to flop. They're just now realizing that they need to do a better job polishing their games. That's why the last Doom was pushed back, as well as Wastelanders. Sounds like the Wendigo Colossus event wash pushed back for the same reason. They are getting better, but like I said it won't happen over night. Trying to compare them to a dev team that has a completely different game and working situation isn't just unfair, it also doesn't make any sense.
---
scrip is scrip.
---
Mine can beat me in those Mortal Kombat games. I never liked those lol.
---
You're right, it is 35%. Thanks for the correction. The stacking is very nice. I think Zealot's is an underrated effect.
---
12 people left, 16 minutes in. Shit is getting tight, can hear lots of shooting.
---
good job
---
I got like 4 Western Outfits from about 30 tickets in the last 50 levels. No fancy weapons, but a friend got one at the same time I was turning in a bunch.
---
That's the point. It would still be a huge grind, leading players to spend. It would also introduce more player choice to progression as well as an endless endgame carrot on a stick.
---
Small farm house north of Bolton greens
---
Down to the last 10 including the 4 of us. 18 minutes done. I have no weapons and we’re nearly in the final circle. Oh there’s the SB..
---
19 with having had 3 daily challenges glitch and not award score
---
2 of the team are down!!!
---
Right the first time
---
Have to move again, but there’s no cover. Crap. 19 minutes down.
---
So I’m guessing their going to “fix that” at the end of the year with the BoS update
---
I've always done the daily and weekly challenges nothing has changed for me and I've always got more atoms than I can spend in the atom shop so having those cosmetic is a welcome change for me
---
the raiders are only slightly less assholey than the settlers.. I wish the game allowed many more of them to be shot in the face to death than it does...
---
Since paper sacks are unreliable I always put mine in the foolocker inside the little museum/tourist shop.
---
I can see people with guns moving around. Gonna stay here and get wiped out by the fire.
---
I noticed that my damage had decreased but didn't know the cause. Appreciate the heads-up.
---
You can work with both sides to prepare to break into the Vault. This way, you get rewards from both sides. But then you just choose right before the actual raid who you’re going in with. 
---
More time to decide too! I chose raiders because they’re more fun and Paige is a stick in the mud. None of the settlers laugh at my jokes or sarcasm. Bunch of babies.
---
Not to be another negative commenter, but there really inst any testing in using the main consumables, bloodied builds and fixers.
---
no, it is a combat rifle skin.
---
You can say the same thing over and over all day and it doesn't change anything. As for the bold, ridiculous type; I didn't do that. No idea what it happened. Not the first time it's happened to me today.
---
I always liked playing solo but these seasons update makes it perfect to play in a group. What I don't get it is why some high levels kick out of the groups my lower level character. I can handle myself with enough resources during events and even if I don't join a certain higher level event they will still get my extra xp as long as I stay in the group.
---
That’s it. We’re out. Team eliminated - 4th Place. Not bad for 21 minutes of hiding. Oh well, time to do it all again. Boring!!
---
It doesn’t matter only thing you get is the trophy afterwards you can rank up both sides to the max 
---
You don’t really choose a faction
---
This would make less players looking the same. Right now, you are grinding daily to look exactly like everyone else. If there were 5 different season, each with different rewards that the player can choose to pursue when they like, people would be getting different cosmetics and camp items leading to more variety. Mind you, if you like grinding everything out and have the time for it, you will still get more out of the system than casual players as while you are working on your 5th complete board, a casual may still be on their first.
---
Yeah they are very useful! And the effects are very cool. Love the confetti.
---
You're allowed to disagree, I dont mind lol. Although it wasn't even up long enough for you to read. So good for you ^_^
---
&gt;I think Zealot's is an underrated effect.
---
Agreed, I used a Primed Zealots, ADS, something UGL as my SBQ weapons for the longest time while waiting for a Junkies - Was still loathed to get rid of it in the end - Workhorse of a gun, but because it's not "Meta" people don't give it the time of day, just like the "slayer" armour types.
---
I can't decide if I'd actually like Monster Hunter, and don't really know if I want to spend $20 to find out.
---
On paper, it does a lot of things I should enjoy, especially with respect to character customization.  On the other hand, the prospect of having to fight the same monster for a half-hour through one pattern after another just seems... tiring.
---
Does the combat rifle have a drum mag?
---
Im not missing the point, you just arent speaking clearly.
---
I've heard some people are in their 30's already, but me personally, I'm at level 24 but havent done my dailies yet.
---
If you choose one side, and at the end of the quest divide the gold between the two factions, they’ll like you more. Highly recommended if you want to become “allies” with both for the trophies (but still a long way to go to do that)
---
Well it lasts ten weeks and we have been through a week of it.
---
So yes. You are ahead and will likely be done in seven or eight weeks.
---
I'm 22. Just use boosters and farm hoard events with Hunters team
---
Idk that seams like alot for Beth to handle...lol
---
No idea who that is. You're welcome to play as you prefer.
---
Snap!  Just focus on day/weekly plus teaming up should do it.
---
Raiders it is!
---
Sorry I’m blonde 🤷🏼‍♀️😆 it has a calibrated receiver on it but there is an option to get tweaked automatic receiver so does that mean it’s under the rifleman perk?
---
Put an instrument on the ladder going underground because you're going to live under the map now... I actually have a similar unremovable stair monster in my camp and am thinking I'll need to redeploy and start over again.
---
Youtuber. Did a good score video
---
yea maybe.
---
Have you seen the video? He does the math in the video
---
Scrap him.  Wait a few days.  Replace him.
---
Hope for the best and prepare for the worst. I’m glad you are in a better place now! Good luck with everything moving forward!!
---
Completely understandable opinion. Now have fun shooting the same super mutants, scorched and hounds one after another.
---
It lasts ten weeks. We are one week in.
---
There are 100 levels.
---
DO MATH
---
Right - Game 2, in the lobby. 
---
Again, 4 randoms, let’s see if we can make it for the last 8/9 minutes of this stupid challenge.
---
They said that the negative effects would be eliminated, but you could still eat and drink for positive bonuses. The bars shall remain....
---
Am I in the obligation to pay a suscription to evade this kind of player behaviour?
---
I can admit everyone can play however they want, but the super high level selfish players make me angry.
---
I'm only level 85 and I am able to understand that I can enjoy the game without spoiling other players experience.
---
Not all the levels are the same. Chill the hell out. Don’t be a dick
---
Ugh, I’ve done the encryptid event every time it’s come up since I’ve been strong enough to contribute (4-6 times so far), and have yet to get the plan for the fixer. Though I did just get an explosive furious  level 50 legendary combat rifle, so that should suffice for a little while.
---
Argh! Flatwoods. Deployed, let’s see!
---
If it was your business you would think much differently think about it the old system gave 6500 atoms a month that's 4x the amount they give a month for fo1st members so of course no ones gonna pay for it. I no damn well if you owned a business your not gonna give out 4x the product your selling so y is it a bad thing when Bethesda does it???
---
Just another guy that wants everything but wants to do nothing
---
Was that with update 20 or a future update?
---
Uh oh someone nearby
---
True. I didn’t think or care to much about posts like this UNTIL I saw this first hand during the sbq event. A group of players launched a nuke to start the sbq event. I fast traveled there before the nuke hit , just as I always do. Before I could run over to where the Queen spawns, the event was over. So right away, I knew these guys were using the so called ‘magic “ weapons, or doing some sort of exploit. So I hung around for a couple minutes, and what do you know? They launched another nuke at fissure prime, to start another sbq event. So this time, I positioned myself close enough to where she spawns, and started unloading on her right when she came out, with my bloodied ffr gauss minigun. Luckily I did enough damage to be able to loot the body, because right when she landed next to those players, she died in less than 30 seconds. I wasn’t close enough to see what weapons they were using, but I was close enough to see her health just melt. Never seen anyone beat the sbq like that, taking her almost full life down twice in less than 30 seconds. I’m just glad I got something out of the event. But back to the point, I totally agree.
---
Same thing happened to me. So long as I get the points, I’m ok with it not quite working right!
---
ffs why didn't i read this. same thing happened to me today.
---
I pvp with handmades, but a lot of people use quad ffr Tesla’s or explosive lasers. Watch angry turtles video on it.
---
I mean, if you actually read my last comment you'd have seen I definitely included more information to support my point. If you don't want to agree with or try to rebut any of my points than I suppose this discussion is over. Have a good one.
---
If you're running SFE and its out 9f date you need to update it or tab to the pop up and close it.
---
I'm pretty sure that I do a terrible job during events, mostly because I'm just trying to figure them out.. but when I do enter an event where there are other people, I turn off my headset and Mic. I'm sure that I'm being cursed at and insulted and a whole bunch of other stuff, but if I don't hear it I don't care! 😆
---
The moment i paid for the game and its monthly subscription it becomes a service/product. I take my money very seriously so i do the things i spent my money on.
---
3 star mutants 90wr shovel for the win ?
---
I agree with going with the raiders too for these additional reasons: (1) Meg takes all comers and doesn't discriminate; (2) you can get a unique weapon siding with them; (3) the outfit you get is cooler; (4) I think ward is a traitor who sells all the expensive things at the foundation and then has you kill the buyers and retrieve the goods.
---
Just ignore and mute any rude knob jockeys that harass you, play how you want to and f*ck everybody else... Just have fun. Because if you don’t have fun what’s the point?
---
Excellent, spawned in a very nice bush. You know what they say, a bush in the hand is worth two birds in your backpack. Or something.
---
20 minutes down.
---
I try to tap mobs to half and then leave them for the lower levels. But Ill mow a mfer down if it’s damaging The objective
---
The guy above be like *I AM SPEED*
---
Saying the same thing different ways is not saying anything new
---
I’m thinking of going full unyeilding for the Intelligence and use chems and server hop west tek. At 15 int I get 250 exp per mutant and there are around 35 mutants
---
Additional fun thought: If some % of the events aren't done each month then the site regresses with Named NPC's dead
---
i think with update 20 they added more servers because I also noticed less players on my servers and I'm on ps4, maybe the servers are spacing out the players more.
---
He’s got me drinking beer then killing something melee, tried I’d 5 times now and it’s still not completed. Think he’s trying to turn me alcoholic
---
Ok.
---
Am in the first circle. Near the edge though so will need  to move for the next one. 
---
Two of the team are near me. Number 4 is down at Camp Clintock - well outside the circle. They don’t seem to be moving.
---
Sucks major mole rat balls bro!
---
Probably the same reason some Blood Eagles follow you to your respawn points and kill you over and over again. Or maybe for the same reason that ghouls sometimes spawn with no heads and are unkillable.
---
This game, while fun, is broken.
---
I got it from a quest but I can’t remember which one I also found the dragon today in a crate which is great
---
22 minutes. 39 of us left.
---
Maybe after you select legendary run, you can see every season listed on one page, similar to how you select a game mode, you then select the season you want to inspect.
---
42
---
First off, I read your post and you make a good point because it's how I feel as well, or kinda like, I 'want' it to be that way. I work as a healthcare worker and ever since this pandemic I'm working 72 hour weeks with a day off, some of those are 16 hour shifts. I love Fallout, played every game. I LOVE 76, I subscribe to first, I buy alot of Atom shop stuff. This and Apex are the only things I play when I get an hour... the more I look at it, its just a free battle pass or whatever. I know Apex, Fortnite, CoD, CTR, mobile games.. they all have versions of this. 
---
I think them just putting it out for free, giving you 100 days or whatever to complete it and if you wanna shell out 5 bucks at the end because you dident get enough SCORE to get them, it's not bad. Your not missing anything from not buying it.
---
I run full Unyielding, join a building public team for +4int, well rested, cranberry relish and I'll take a berry mentat as well for +5int
---
That’s my plan atm
---
No I meant the high level player that wants to kill everything by themselves should get a private world! Since they want to do it solo anyway
---
Yes!  I'd love some dungeon runs.  Less of those fetch quests where you have to fast travel around the map.  Each time a loading screen.  Let's have some long missions put in.
---
No, she was definitely doing the landing animation. The explosion particle effect wasn't anything the Queen could put out, either.
---
Exactly. He didn't even read it. Plus he's posted supportedly before too for others who have missed days, etc. He's got a job like most of us and so he falls into the majority of players who play this game. So he is an adult. Yet he comes and acts like a little kid instead of bothering to have an actual discussion. We are all allowed to have our opinions, just have a real discussion.  
---
He realized what he was doing and deleted it at least..
---
You're the one making a post about not wanting to coordinate tho.
---
Also, most players join after it starts
---
23 minutes, down to 37 of us including my team. Camp Mclintock teamie is still down there, and the circle is closing!
---
The lunchboxes you get as a reward can also be used near teammates for up to 100% extra xp but I'm saving mine for the double xp weekend.
---
Largely it would detect the devs motivation for fixing bugs.
---
Wait..... you removed the other coment? I was in an NW match so I couldn’t answer it
---
Update 22
---
Jesus christ, some of you people are just too much anymore
---
I LOATHE Colonel Gutsys. Especially the ones that yield what I assume are armor-piercing 5.56 or something. I have a full suit of T-65 &amp; they still hurt like hell! Whenever I see one, I make it a priority &amp; try to insta-kill it before it has a shot at me.
---
you should grind until you’re rank 100 just to be safe
---
That's why I farm XP in peace on my private server, it was getting annoying in public people know the spawn locations 1 hitting everything, I'd even go to White Spring and West Tech and there would always be someone there already killed everything, same with looking for the colored asylum dress's someone has always scooped up everything before me.
---
This is a good idea.
---
One issue. How do you translate all the items you can have from one "run" so the user doesnt have to search to long.
---
Alternatively. What if u wanted to switch from one run to the other. What happens to the progress? It'll have to be reset
---
Do you have a crippling perk on? With a heavy gun and the 'one gun army' perk, one small burst will destroy an engine. Doesn't seem to blow engines easily if I use a rifle or don't have that perk on, but I haven't thoroughly tested it. Because of that, cargobots are incredibly easy for me. Have one fly over my camp at least once a days play period and it slows to a crawl with engine blowout.
---
I started xiv when arr first came out, people yelled at you for not skipping the cutscene.
---
25 minutes!! 5 to go! Shall I stay to the end or drop out when I’ve got that sweet, sweet SCORE?
---
I've found them in explosives cases but they're pretty bad tbh
---
Purveyor sale is 9-13th. Double score is 23rd-27th.  Reddit won't let me post a pic.
---
32 of us left and my Camp McLintock teamie is still there and still alive. WTF? Circle has closed.
---
Ugh, agreed. I have full Ultracite armor and my bf and I went to set off a nuke. And my god, by the time we were done. Most of my armor was shattered.
---
Gotta move, brb.
---
The few times this happened to me I actually got close enough to the dead body that the game registered my funding him.
---
I’ve had  3 daily challenges auto complete awarding zero score, opened a support ticket, doubt they will do anything though
---
Go to scorched earth and just wait until someone dies, or try to use public teams to lure a newer player into the bog
---
Join a public team and follow them around...sooner or later one will go down🤟
---
Encrypted is the easiest way to revive in water
---
Nah I just think it's wrong to promote ignoring coordination in a team based game
---
Or set it in autopsy mode to assasinate the next unlucky bastard that happens to use it
---
You and me both. What’s your fancy gun named?
---
For better or worse, this is what being a Fallout fan is about. Enjoying the things that work as expected, understanding what doesn’t work and in some cases even adopting to the outstanding bugs as an addendum to the game rules.
---
If you like TES lore, it's 100% worth your time. The One Tamriel update really made me love the game, and I've put in a ton of time since. I haven't played in a while just because I've been busy with other games and life, but I'm fully planning to go back and play catchup whenever the next chapter comes out.
---
Thanks! Once you figure out how the building system works, you can do a fair bit, despite how limiting it can feel.  Not really, even if it was nuked, it's fairly cheap to fix, and you can do so through the CAMP robot to mass-repair.
---
Okay mate, well I've crafted you a 10mm, a .38 pistol and a .44 magnum, I have a couple of full sets of leather armor you can have plus 300 or so of each ammo plus some stims if you need them, in game now if you're around.
---
You either didn't read or your reading comprehension is terrible. I clearly added far more information and detail than my first post. Obviously I'm going to be driving home the same point, that's how debate works. You just failed to actually review, understand, or aknowledge anything I presented in support of my position.
---
Agreed...Mistress of Mystery was a favorite questline of mine and one of the few that (in my opinion) is on the same footing as side quests from Fallout 3 and New Vegas.
---
Its called feedback and its a regular thing in the business world, welcome to the world mate.
---
I just did a whitesprings run
---
Hold my hands up here, I run bloody mele and often one shot legendaries and even squatch if I forget to switch to my tagging 10mm and just get caught up in smashing stuff!  Forgive me.
---
Your right I'll be the king of lawyers
---
Jesus. You don't have the Power Patcher perk equipped? Before the T-65, I had a full suit of T-51b &amp; I seldom need to repair it. It could take a full on abuse &amp; heavy battle &amp; it'd be perfectly fine. Nothing but a scratch.
---
Everyone is saying cooked meat but corn soup did the trick for me.
---
You actually get less free things compared to the previous system. A lot less
---
Raiders has more interesting missions than settlers, and better quest rewards and uniques. You can get a free 3* from the raiders, and also get more fun stuff to happen
---
There's a perk that reduces their resistances by 75%, I think you can pacify them, and melee build absolutely squash them.  They are pretty much only tanky vs guns with the wrong perks.  And considering they drop lots of acid, I think it reasonable for them to be tough.  They can also be crippled to make them much slower, which is useful at cricket hordes.  Cripple the legendary, kill the never-ending mobs for infinite acid.
---
Are you an Enclave general?
---
I shot him in the head, bashed him with my gun and it still did not work...hmm
---
Yes I am I’m in silo Charlie as I type this
---
I was thinking no progression resets. If you want 20 in one season and 50 in another, you simple change which season your exp is going towards. As far as searching items, you simply scroll between boards, and search items the same way you do now.
---
I think to get from level 1-100 through atoms it’ll cost roughly 200$CAD, so I think that’s the case
---
Literally this. It will be the Public Event one the CMs are fumbling over
---
I don’t use my power armor very much unless I’m going into a nuked zone. My build is heavily relied on no power armor.
---
Ok.  Back in the circle, just in time. 29 minutes down. 21 players left. Think I might just hang around as long as I can. All 4 teamies still alive, including Campy, who must have been moving despite my map not updating.
---
This is a problem I come across often. I also would like to see a beam of some sort shoot into the sky like diablo maybe.. what u guys think?
---
Thank you for the work you are doing right now. It has got to be hell for you and your family but I wish you the very best and hope that you stay healthy through this difficult time.  
---
I also subscribe to 1st. I too enjoy buying stuff from the Atom shop though until now 1st and free atoms held me over. However consider how much a single door costs in real life money, I can't see it costing 5$ to finish the board. Those of us who have 1st might have the extra Atoms to finish it, but considering the lost SCORE from bugs, that's a loss we shouldn't even have. For someone without 1st though, I wonder how much it is going to cost for the average player to finish their board.
---
I completely forget the drop acid!! I need to go farm some of those bastards.
---

---
now tell me again.
---
If you’re going full Cha luck you should build a medic and play with friends, as the Medic s effect is super effective in vats builds for commando
---
No, you cannot
---
...um..because...it's actually the receptacles that you are collecting from, that are damaging you with radiation. ya, that's it. the sub standard materials they were using in the area at that time, reacting with the local aquifiers has created a sort of rad sponge effect that is slowly emitting  small doses of radiation whenever they are handled.
---
it's lore. honest.
---
Yeah that could be a good as well, like it doesnt need to be super dynamic, just another thing to keep people occupied, I mean not all additional game content needs to be for end game or creating the perfect god build
---
30 minutes!!!!! SCORE done, half way through rank 20 now. Don’t care about the rest of the match now but let’s see.. the circle has closed and I have to move again.
---
My berserker would like a word...
---
No its called entertainment and its a regular human behavior. Are you a mole man? Cause you seem to lack understanding in regular human behavior. When you get out your moms basemant youll understand the world better.
---
The legendary race isn't about fun. It adds nothing new to the game to play with. It is structured grind progression. All it does different than the previous system is make purchases for you. That isn't fun.
---
Don't worry about it. It said right the second time. Autocorrect changed it.
---
I see where you are getting at.
---
But. Lets say u do 20 ranks on season A and get all those rewards. And you switch to season B. Would u get the 20 rewards from B?
---
Ok. I plan on exclusively playing with a friend of mine in a duo and then probably grouping up with fandoms here and there. But that sounds interesting.  Any link to more info?
---
So you were supportive before and not now. Somebody must be having a bad day. Throwing out insults and tantrums like that. Downvoting everybody. No point in feeding him. Just let him be.
---
I've lost two legendary corpses in Heart of the Swamp today
---
Edited: spelling
---
I have most fun building cool camps, if only they had a better system for building multiple camps as mine get so complicated there is no way i can move them then place them again.
---
Assaultrons are OVERPOWERED
---
I lost 1000 yesterday
---
Sometimes I think they disappear! I tagged a legendary mole miner in uranium fever today and could not find him after!
---
it's fake news btw.
---
some guys are exploiting it and found a way to reach t100 already.
---
You are 100% right. I just got beat up on a sub because I can't spend hours and hours grinding to get the 100 score over and over. I work a lot, I have my own business and with COVID, I've had basically redo everything in my business to keep it going and support the families trusting in us to find a way to survive through this. 
---
At the end of the day, I don't care what the SCORE math is, it's all free stuff. And it's all cosmetic.
---
To me, I think it's perfectly fair to allow players to earn it by playing a lot everyday, and I also think it's great that players like yourself, myself, or the healthcare individual (thank you for your service) have an option to get the rewards through money. We don't have time but we still love the game, and $5-20 is nothing when you are working a ton. It's all time value for each person, we are all in different seasons (no pun intended) of life and I think the way did this was reasonably fair.
---
For all the entitled baby's saying micro transactions we are ruining the game, shut up. No one is forcing you to buy anything, having the option to buy helps everyone and it supports a game we all love.
---
Seeing how the game was sold WITHOUT development i was thinking the box price may fund some of it.
---
Datamine &gt; YouTube anecdote
---
youre just as likely to blow yourself up as you are what you are shooting at, so keep that in mind, its quite annoying, but very unique.
---
Idk if it was coincidental, but I’ve taken photos of the body twice and got the quest to finish that way.
---
The math is done all over the sub. You need more than just dailys and eeeklys, something to the tune of 4x the repeatable per week
---
You're probably not using as many damage perks as you could. Try it:  
---
* 3x lvl 3 heavy guns damage perks
---
* bloody mess
---
* tenderizer
---
* Stabilized (PA only)
---
* One Gun Army
---
* heavy barrel on the .50
---
I'm at 23 just farming XP every day in private as well as weekly and daily challenges.
---
Its not a meal if it doesn't have meat in it! ;)
---
I can send you a nukesdragons link in a bit to give you a general idea of the build type you’d need for it to work
---
Same with the treasure hunter crap.
---
I was think of people in your position when I thought of this.
---
I’ll give this load out a try! Thanks :)
---
Submit a support ticket, the more tickets they get the more annoyed they will be with the bug as well, then hopefully they will fix it
---
Ok 8 of us left but 2 of my team have been hit and one is now down. SB is around.
---
agree, it would be even better if i could just scrip all the weapons/armor im sitting on while waiting for cooldowns to expire.
---
I'm telling ya man that diablo beam effect would help so much. Like just on legendary  or boss's  it would help alot.. I've lost track of the imposter sheepsquatchs corpse a few time lol. It sucked so bad
---
This is good to know. I hope people keep threads going so people can kinda gauge where they should be from week to week to make it.
---
You don't have to get everything ....
---
6 of us left, 3 in my team. I have no weapons.
---
I have not used a scrap box, why is it essential?
---
Gotta move again.
---
I'll give this a whirl, thanks!
---
What platform are you on?
---
I'm all about coordination, team work and helping others to learn, what I'm against is agressive behaviour. Please read the post again.
---
Does it sound like the fan is spinning up like a jet plane? Mine did. Heating paste needed replacement.
---
Saying that fallout has a small team then coming back with the fallout team has less people is not adding anything new. 
---
Look I read your shit. Each thing you posted. I understand what you're saying but, Mr fucking reading comprehension, you've come back time and again saying it's not fair to compare the two teams. I never once, not one fucking time, compared the two teams. I said one can learn from the other. That's an entirely different animal than comparing them. 
---
You can argue all fucking day but you're not even arguing with my original post. You've run off in some other direction that had nothing to do with what I said. I don't care if it's one person vs a thousand, my point was that Bethesda puts this shit out without any regard for its condition on release and the MH team puts care and passion in to every aspect of their game. Anything beyond that is completely unrelated and irrelevant. 
---
That's it. You're wasting my time with completely unrelated arguments and saying I said things I never said. There is no point in wasting any more time with you.
---
What a fixer and why it value so high
---
I like the NW tip of the map. Almost straight north of Aaronholt.  It's very pretty up there. 
---
Are you looking for a stream or a lake?
---
Trust me get yourself a mule, moving all the stuff I didn’t use in it made the game so much more playable
---
it wont make a difference after the last 2-3 hours of quests.
---
PS4
---
I’m down!!! 5th place. 1 team member - Campy - left. Let’s follow them.
---
This is awkward
---
Plus the Two Shot was nerfed and each shot only has 62.5 of the original's base damage. So a 2shot .50 cal only deals 125% base damage.
---
On high fire rate guns you're better off with furious (or vampire so at lease you become immortal while hitting something).
---
Or of course you could put Adrenal Reaction + Nerd Rage + Bloodied in top of all that list and join our gang heh :)
---
This is my biggest complaint about 76 performance. Nothing frustrates me like laggy inventory management screens and it hasn’t seems to have been addressed at all in recent memory.
---
Final circle is at New River and Campy is now hiding in a building.
---
The hate is real.. I don't get it. I don't mind a few bucks at the end (or nothing since I have 1st and can maybe use those,) but I wonder about the people who do not know how to avoid the autocomplete bug yet because nothing official has been said. Thankfully I saw it early enough, but its obvious with all the daily posts people still don't read through things. I think it's best when we all look out for the community as a whole. So far this game has done a good job at that.
---
Sounds good. I just hate wasting time when I'm playing an RPG lol
---
I just dont get why they would just delete content they worked on when this game could benefit greatly from keeping it around. Both from consumer spending and player retention.
---

---
You can use a plasma flamer to heal allies directly or with the medics effect in vats, and using stims or liquor can revive them
---
What level are you?
---
Yes! I agree. I just think it’d be a big shame if that was just it
---
3 players left including Campy. Circle closing in 30 seconds.
---
The only good thing about seasons is that I don't have to change my outfit before I level up.
---
Not sure if it’s a sign but Campy is level 76!
---
But it feels like I loosing items, not getting additional items. There no way in game to get lunchboxes / skins without atoms
---
I was about to quit the game but seasons gave me a reason to stay
---
I’ve out right lost score for doing the challenges and just not been rewarded anything. No prompt, no score, just it gets completed but again no reward
---
Campy is moving, brave! Well, they have to they’re outside the circle. They are getting shot though.
---
Campy is down, Campy is down!!! That’s it, team out. Bye!
---
I agree. While you are finishing the first season you will be missing out on the next seasons if you choose to finish it. The way i see it, this is both incentive for spending as well as player retention.
---
Maybe its just me but this is only the first week, I have had no problem with getting the challenges completed and I only play about 1 hour a nite
---
Eh it’s gonna be worse at the end when the levels cost more xp than dailies award, but they definitely award at least 10 levels of free atoms along the way. 
---
I haven’t been playing a lot the last week and made 25 today. Literally only 1-2 hours a day to get dailies and run a queen or two. Besides Saturday, I did get 4 hours in.
---
Difference from other games being that you have the option to not pay anything at all if you choose the grind. 
---
And let’s be honest if you bought the game at $60 you’ve definitely got your money’s worth considering it was only full price for a week or so after it came out.
---
I know I can’t complain rarely any game I’ve played makes it to 2k hours.
---
Oh okay. I heavily rely on PA. I have like 100+ Fusion Cores &amp; perks dedicated to it. I prefer to stay alive, know what I mean? But anyways, yes, Gutsys are such... OP SOBs.
---
I have an Instigating dragon just for them, it pulls them out of the sky in one shot.
---
Fuck exclusive content
---
Without knowing how much they play you can't say that.
---
They're at the level they should be at the moment which means they WONT do it in 10 unless they do more repeatable or go the double days.
---
No, season A will remain at 20 until you return to it while season B will start at 1 again.
---
No, you are just without a team. You should be able to join another public team.
---
Sounds like I’ve got a lot of catching up to do, what expansions have been added so far? I’ll probably start another Kahjitt character
---
Agreed.  With one exception:  Radiation Rumble, when there are not enough peeps present to collect ore AND protect the NPCs.
---
Then I am glad they are there mowing everything down.
---
It’s a gun and because it’s a rare drop from the event
---
Encrypted
---
That’s some pretty advanced edging
---
I want to say that others have posted that it diminishes around 40.
---
I'll let you in on a secret:
---
All those Ghillie cosmetics were withheld from the NW Survivor challenge.
---
And there are a lot more they're still holding onto to.
---
So far I've learned a few things about PvP.
---
 The faster the gun the better.
---
Legacies are top tier.
---
Quad gamma guns are perfect for non PA enemies.
---
Give up if the enemy gets God mode.
---
Currently don't use guns in Vats unless you have Explosive weapons because Vats is broken and damage won't connect unless it explodes.
---
This game is a total grind fest and its not an organic grind. So you wont achieve it by just playing naturally if anything it discourages freedom and exploring which is the whole appeal of these games.
---
You answered it yourself, low intelligence.
---
Technically the max is 99. But that involves exploits
---
The more intelligence you have, the more xp you get from kills
---
theyll probably let you buy the levels you missed for the 2 weeks up until season 2 starts, gotta get that LAST CHANCE TO GET REWARDS money
---
But they need to make up for people cancelling Fallout 1st somehow! ^_^  
---
Enjoy your vacation!! Its good you already decided what you will do.
---
Nope my wireless PS4 is just fine
---
I left the area, the came back a few minutes later, and it finally registered, IiRC correctly
---
The main, main menu. Maka a party then move into the mode.
---
I moved all my plans/misc/holos and other stuff I never use to a mule. Made it run so much better
---
Add me. Acorncadet. I won’t be on for about 6-7 hours though.
---
Fried on meth occasionally lol
---
I think adding more and more would create long term reasons to stay not to mention a large shop of cosmetics that would jsut keep getting bigger allowing people that dont want the grind to pay for what they want.
---
You get it.
---
You can google the steam charts player count. Looks like from May to June the player count on steam was nearly cut in half, and it looks like it's continuing to go down, albeit slower. People will only put up with so many bugs for so long I guess
---
Edit: keep in mind these numbers don't include players who use the Bethesda launcher or console players
---
Thank you. I will try that in future.
---
The only issue I have is when people place their survival tent 10 miles in the air and shoot the queen from it during Scorched earth.
---
It causes the queen to never land and constantly crop dust the rest of us.
---
I dont know how ppl are getting their tent so high when I can hardly place my own tent.
---
It seems like you don't understand what I wrote so let's take a few steps back go over it again. 
---
If you have time to burn, go ahead do all the challenges to earn the rewards. Your paying with your time and effort.
---
If your working a lot like a lot of adults, and you can't log in everyday and put in hours and hours, but you can play now and then and earn some rewards, that's great to. 
---
If at the end you see something really want (for me it's the white raider mask with the blood handprint on it)  for 150 atoms and your working a lot and have money, then by all means, pick it up. 
---
This system works for everyone, how is it unfair or unreasonable?
---
I used to play without voice chat, but a while back i tried it and was surprised at how little people actually talk. Most of the time they do it is useful for the event
---
So why do I take Rad damage from my clean sink🤔
---
It’s amusing. I’m playing with bows only on one of my alts. Arrows slow enough you can see the arrow flying straight to the mole miner (95% chance to hit) and then it’ll veer around it and continue onward.
---
I'm trying to invite him on the main menu but it's not letting me
---
I try 2 but I usually get stuck at 1.
---
Even the cosmetics?
---
You know that loot bags despawn, right?
---
Perhaps that's one explanation. Also their more competent programmers might be working on Starfield.
---
Barely...it may break down, quit, or even blow uo....but it works.
---
atoms, outfits, camp items and such are for all chars
---
resource packages, legendary coin, gold and such are for the active char only
---
Damn, judging by the downvotes people love their headless, unkillbilly ghouls.
---
I hate them. Had one during the census event that was floating 6 foot in the air. Scorchbeast came out and VATS kept targeting flyboy.
---
Thanks for the clarification. This is not good news. It’s also just a weird way to implement friendly fire.
---
No it does not. However, you can be in a group of just yourself and get the bonus effects from the group you choose.
---
I don’t need to see the video. 
---
But you know what. There is a double score daily event. So that actually should allow you to hit the target just from challenges. The gap would have been about 5k score before they announced the double daily score weekend.
---
What signs point towards that exactly?
---
Your literally trying to start fights , hurk a dur I boughtva triple a title oh no it has more than 100 hours play time what ever shall I do maybe I'll go play a game with less repeatability and not whine about this since I'm trying to be a edgelord
---
Nah, 1k presents disappearing won’t make a difference. Dupers have MILLIONS of presents. I’ve seen a guy screenshot his inv with over 8 figures worth of large Holiday gifts. Getting people to trade them away so they’ll be tossed out isn’t going to change anything. People need to stop accepting gift trades. Which we know isn’t gonna happen. (Lets be honest, people are greedy and don’t give a shit) Bethesda HAS to step in and wipe gifts. It’s gotten too far out of hand for community shifts to make any kind of difference.
---
I can assure you that it's outdated. The level curve table was updated quite some time ago. Every level up increases the amount of XP needed by 160, the 15880 for 100 is no longer the freeze point.
---
Source: Me, level 415. I currently need roughly 66500 XP to get to the next level.
---
Fasnacht, Meat Week and Mischief Night are the 3 most enjoyable events.
---
And they're pulled as fast as they come.
---
Game is still starved for content. Why they pull anything this early into the life cycle is baffling.
---
When was the last time you played? There have been a bunch of dungeon DLCs, some smaller zone/faction DLCs (Murkmire, Thieves Guild, and Dark Brotherhood), and a few chapters (major expansions, such as the Summerset Isles, Elswyr, and Morrowind). I enjoyed all of the chapters. I think that Morrowind was really cool, but Summerset had a better story. Of the zone DLCs, my favorite was Murkmire. I haven't played anything released after Elswyr, so there's a few things I've missed (Graymoor?). I hope you enjoy delving into everything!
---
Honestly.. I agree.. Especially if they can't fix the bugs again. Just let it die. No more arguing about it then, problem solved. Or change the time constraints. Let it go for six months. Even with bugs people will finish it and Bethesda can drop new content month three of each "season" for when the hardcores finish so they don't get bored waiting for the next season.
---
Oh right man a figured it out thanks for the help
---
Thats what we do. We set our team to building and then when we do a major event like scorched earth or encrypted, we switch it to events.
---
Your behind if your bellow 20 come.tomorrpws reset
---
When looking in my vendor to add stuff my fps drops significantly (PC) it's pretty annoying
---
Ah. Thats what i meant.
---
Sorry if that wasn't clear.
---
I saw a bag with one in it so I used it and dropped it again I usually find one and keep it in my stash till it comes up again but this is more convenient
---
"Hush, kiddo. Not right now." 
---
Every day. I'll have to try the scrap and go with the Punk for a few days and go back.
---
It sucks because I was getting some decent stuff out of Gramps that I wasn't getting out of Murrmurr-gherd.
---
The basic tent can be repeatedly stacked upon itself
---
Make the G.E.N.E. editor use the same device and mechanics such as the biometric scanners we use to launch nukes.
---
Did you just get Herd Mentality? I have gotten it twice today and I do not see it in my active mutations listings. I heard a streamer mention there's an issue with HM right now. I get the message that I have gained it, but neither the negative or positive effects are showing :/
---
youre a victim of the repsawn rules, i think there is a youtube video that explains it...short version, come back into the cell in 10 minutes. to avoid this behavior entirely, i think you can login somewhere else, port to ws, run through ws to trigger spawns, launch your nuke and you should be good. 10 minutes seems like it always applies
---
That would be very nice.  I have no idea if Bethesda would do it.
---
Not yet, im probably going to get now since theres public teams
---
I’ve ran with Adrenal reaction, Speed Demon, Marsupial, carnivore, healing factor, and twisted muscles, and grounded for literally hundreds of levels. Just mutations I got that I thought looked nice. Made the effort today to do away with healing factor and twisted muscles since I don’t need them for my bloodied rifle build... 
---
Cost me 17,500 caps to get my mutations back via serums from Modus... I know caps are basically worthless but still, that price tag hurt a little bit. Thinking it might be time to invest in buying the recipes.
---
(I know I could have gotten them for 500 a piece from someone over on the market but my schedule had been so janked lately, I didn’t wanna make plans to meet up with someone in game and then fall asleep on them... I did that to someone last night and felt really bad about it because they were really nice too.)
---
I've missed eight 95% shots from my Gauss rifle recently. EIGHT.
---
It actually works both ways.
---
This game feels like it could snap under it's own weight at any moment. I half expect some new item or effect will be added and make it unplayable until its removed.
---
Hmmm I think back in 2014 maybe?
---
It doesn’t appear exactly consistent, I’m assuming it’s rounding errors based on XP awarded, but roughly 5-6% every 3 INT. Tested on Warlords from 17-39 INT.  Got all the way up to 45 INT but that was on a team and Inspirational kicked in to juice XP even further. There may be a slight diminishing return at very high levels, but it still keeps going up. No cap I can see. 
---
Results on lvl 68 Warlord: 
---
17 INT solo - 222 XP
---
20 INT solo - 235
---
23 INT solo - 249
---
26 INT solo - 262
---
29 INT solo - 275
---
32 INT solo - 288
---
35 INT solo - 302
---
36 INT solo - 306
---
37 INT solo - 313
---
39 INT solo - 321
---
41 INT plus Inspirational 3 - 380
---
45 INT plus Inspirational 3 - 402
---
I remember thinking like this while playing games. I really want to train myself to think that way again. It’s just being immersive. A lot of times as an adult you just see the tasks and the time it takes to do them and you’re thinking with your real life Brain. It kills the fun of games. Kids, they just go into it and they just live in the experience which makes it feel completely different. It’s not a grind, it’s just living in the wasteland
---
You are 100% correct. If you're a new player you have to go farm materials extensively to craft at a hurried pace or completely miss out on rewards to play the game how you want.
---
 If you are an old player than youll just grind the xp score by running the same locales ad nauseum. Seasons discourages free roaming and going at your own pace to explore. Gold already made most events obsolete as we all just do the same 5-6 now and the you dont need every item crowd are delusional because getting everything is the only endgame in 76 because this is the crap they give us.
---
I sold the Fixer plan for pretty much the same amount, I had absolutely no idea it was worth so much...
---
Legendary coin is a beautiful name for scrip, ngl
---
The Stimpak one is incredibly easy, just put on Pharma farma and you'll get a bunch of stims in no time.
---
Oh no
---
I saw a 11000 once
---
My record is 5 shots missed in a row with 95% in VATS showing...then reloading and it happening another 5 times.  Battle gameplay weirdness like this is my only real complaint about the game.  Other oddness and quirks in the game, like having to switch to the world map and back before a robot vendor will let me trade, I can handle.  But wonkiness in the heat of the battle is just wrong and kinda shitty that Bethesda hasn't worked it out by now. 
---
Still really like the game though!
---
For me, the daily/weekly challenges for atoms were replaced with a system I don't have the time to fully enjoy. I really only get to play on weekends. This means that if I really hustle, I can _maybe_ get to level 50. I've lost player choice, and I get less than I would have received previously.
---
Now instead of a couple hundred atoms this week, I've obtained... a clean sink, a useless ammo generator and some lunchboxes. I know I can't possibly achieve completing the legendary run, so there's no need for me to pay it any attention. I'll get stuff when I get it, but instead of being able to buy things I _want_ I get stuff I _might_ want. It's a huge change for some of us.
---
All that said, I don't mind it too much. Destiny 2 has a similar thing and in the past I never had a problem clearing it, but that was thanks to them not gating the dailies so hard. And if there was new content in FO76, I'd be playing that content and collecting SCORE happy as a clam... but to log in and do the _same exact stuff_ I've been doing for 12+ months, but get less in return for it? Nah, I'm good.
---
Haven't named it yet. It's a one star nocturnal so Big Ol Piece of Junk is fitting lol. It's not worthy of being called Big Iron yet.
---
After level 50 you still get either Perk card or move 1 SPECIAL point per level (plus card pack every 5 levels), so you can modify your build...
---
There are lotsa guides in Youtube for example, I recommend checking channel by "Angry Turtle", he has good guides imo...
---
If you back out and use VATS again, it should work.
---
Now you have lost me... You're saying this system is good for everybody when only  hard-core players (which is a small minority) &amp; whales who rather pay ways instead of playing would get full rewards.
---
What about those players who play somewhat casually but are interested in the game but busy and can't afford to continue paying for the game itself, fallout 1st, atom store and now levelling the seasons?
---
This system ONLY works for Bethesda, the only excuse you have for the grind is that it's free, then what about the atom challenges being replaced with this SCORE system? Atoms are no longer required as constant and free as from this current patch.
---
Atom challenges being replaced means Bethesda can controller the "free" content much easier while focusing more on the mtx content and they're still asking players to constantly grind day in day out to not even reach the top level but don't worry.. you'll get the pay to get to top level by atoms.
---
I'm doing the same but with herbivore. because I can use the brain fungus soup and cranberry relish to stack with each other. I know it's harder to get but if you are a carnivore you'll benefit even more from scorchbeast brains. It's nearly a +8 to INT.
---
“Godzilla had a stroke reading this”
---
Mod that bad boy
---
Even without the perk, if you spawn in the lake and never leave the water, you never start getting rads. Although you can't dive to hide the head. I got lucky the other day and was able to do about 20 minutes in a single match because the lake always happened to be inside the safe area.
---
Soon lol
---
Just because we hate it doesnt mean we don't use it. Also other people love it and buy all my ammo fast
---
Those apply to everyone. 
---
Consumables are character specific.
---
Jesus, I feel like I’m lagging. I’ve done all the dailies up to now and completed all the weekly challenges and I’m only rank 18
---
Which challenges?
---
I totally get this. But as someone with (mumble mumble) hours in the game, I appreciate having some new goals. 
---
Score has me playing Nuclear Winter for the first time, and I love that now we always play in teams.
---
Unfortunately I feel the need to grind score, which has me plowing through events, and perhaps not being my most courteous self. (Apologies to anyone with me at Guided Meditation yesterday).
---
It might be nice to get something at the end of week one that says, if you’re on step xx, at this pace you will finish by day xx, which would help me pave.
---
So you're saying that in the ~6 days that the season has been active, you've managed to grind ~30 levels (easily over 30,000 S.C.O.R.E required, not counting the gradual increase) purely from completing the 10,000 EXP/100 S.C.O.R.E. challenges? Do you sleep, eat, or blink?

Ok so..

Plus they're a few other places I'll attach a link for a guide i used when I first started playing and had ammo problems.

It's a little old but honestly all the spots are still golden and there's also some info in there on enemy spawns and plan locations etc. Hope this helps buddy

That is dope
---
Destiny 2 season content is so easy, already 148 on season pass 3 weeks in. Fallout 76 season pass is crazy grindy.
---
If this is on PC you aren't hopping strong enough because I see people selling ammo all the time. Including myself.
---
Yeah man. I would be happy to help you at the same time. Add me and we work out a time.
---
Yeah, they put all that time and effect into designing it only to pull it after one season? I don’t think so,
---
*Cries in Scorched Earth*
---
I don't think this is right. I've mostly heard this expression in regard to getting older, and it's never seen as a good thing.
---
If you throw a new character together you'll get it done fast. Just pull out that character with you need the level up. score goes across your whole account not just your character
---
I agree with this 100%. Well done OP.
---
I'm dropping all my extra rounds in the Flatwoods Church.  Deleted my ammo converter.  Not worth the effort.
---
and on the tes that is gonna launch next year, can be that too but is a huge shame that fallout 76 is getting little to none support, imagine if this game had no bad performance and glitches, would be one of the most played MMO now like eso
---
I guess it’s just me, but, I love the ammo converter. I’m scooping.38’s and arrows again. Usually a days adventures fed into the hopper keeps me in .50 and .556’s. I’m definitely at the ammo bench less now.

Yup, made about 10k caps tonight selling ammo.

I mean you can think what you want lol

If either of you from PS4 let me know cuz I rock me some nuclear winter and I promise you these challenges are easier than you think. Especially since they reworked it and made them more basic I promise the dailies before these new seasons were actually more of a pain than they are now.
---
I have this issue since p20 as well.
---
It does work in a group by yourself. 100%
---
\+3 to all specials. And if you have class freak 3 you might not even get any negative effects when by yourself and not in a team depending on what other mutations you have. I have no negative effects from it. Someone else had -1 out of a team.
---
But there's no reason not to be in a team these days.#
---
Also. Most team based perks work as well. Inspiration does.
---
Is this what being schizophrenic looks like?
---
I see what you did there *upvote*
---
I got me a 1* Hunter and a 1* Exterminator the first time I turned in a few tickets and nothing in the month since and dozens of tickets since.
---
Spot on.  Converted to it a couple of weeks ago.
---
Just need unyielding SS armour now 😂
---
Oh wow that is on point. I always thought some of these might make a cool set of spikes.

---
Nice to know that I am now screwed because I didn't play over the weekend
---
I would have preferred this score system was more akin to the Pioneer Scout Challenges.  For the scouts you could do them at your leisure and in the order of your choosing.
---
Yuppers. Seems to get worse if I'm on a public team.
---
There is XP that is tied to your characters level. You get this for killing enemies, completing tasks, crafting items etc.   When you reach a certain amount of XP, your character will level up, level 49 to level 50 for example.  I'm sure you understand this aspect.
---
With the Legendary Run, they've introduced a S.C.O.R.E bar, that requires specific S.C.O.R.E XP that can only be achieved through certain challenges.  This can be something like "Scrap 5 hunting rifles - 250 S.C.O.R.E XP". 
---
 If you complete that quest, 250 XP will be added to your S.C.O.R.E level, but not to your characters level.  In the same vein, if you kill something it will add XP to your characters level, but not to your S.C.O.R.E level.
---
Each time you level up your S.C.O.R.E, the next level will require an extra 25 S.C.O.R.E XP.
---
As an example if i need 1000 S.C.O.R.E XP to reach S.C.O.R.E level 2, then i will need 1025 S.C.O.R.E XP to reach level 3, 1050 S.C.O.R.E XP for level 4 and so on.
---
If it takes 1000 S.C.O.R.E XP to reach level 2, I could do 4 of the challenges that net 250 S.C.O.R.E XP, and I've hit level 2.  Now at S.C.O.R.E level 2, if i do another 4 challenges, I'm short 25 S.C.O.R.E XP to reach level 3, so I'll have to do a 5th challenge to gain the extra S.C.O.R.E XP.
---
Again killing an enemy may net 100 XP, but that's XP that is tied to your character's level, not your S.C.O.R.E.  Again completing specific challenges is the only way to gain S.C.O.R.E XP, and you can see what they are by going to Daily and Weekly section under challenges.
---
***I've purposely overexplained this as a hope you'll understand it better***
---
No I just thought mine were all 45 but glad to hear its lvl 50.(Unless mine really are lvl 45 hmmm...)
---
Yeah herd mentality will help cause im going to move the lone wanderer card to Adrenaline (when its fixed) as I’ll probably always be in a team
---
I think people are getting worked up seeing the big numbers without realizing how big an XP boost the public teams give. A full team gives you double XP on events, so just doing those will net you a ton. My first day I hadn't transitioned to the XP-farming setup, and I _still_ gained 2 levels and got to Rank 10 after I had completed the dailies (except NW) and weeklies.
---
Now that I'm focused on grinding XP? I can't _not_ level up more than once. To put things into perspective: Last week I was level 275. Yesterday I was at 295 or something.
---
My original comment never said anything about the teams size so try again. Also, you may not have directly compared the two but just by saying that the 76 team should learn from the MH:W team you're putting them in the same category and by extension comparing the two  You also keep missing the point that the two games are almost entirely different and that what works for one doesn't work for the other. 
---
How is the 76 team supposed to learn from another team when what they do can't possibly be translated over into their game? Can you answer that? You say you don't care how many people are on their team but that's a very real factor in what they can actually accomplish. Whether you want to aknowledge it or not 300 people can get a lot more done than 100 or fewer. It's a simple fact 
---
Your point that they put out content without any concern for quality was also refuted, however you chose to ignore it. Since you missed it last time both the newest Doom game and Wastelanders were delayed specifically because Bethesda realized that they fucked up releasing incredibly unpolished work. You want them to learn from their mistakes then willfully ignore the examples of them trying to learn from their mistakes.
---
There's a lot the dev team should be criticized for and that they can do better. But it doesn't help to be unrealistic about what can be done or how the problems can be fixed. Telling an apple to be more like an orange isn't going to do anything to change the apple.
---
No problems buying or selling ammo here. (PC)
---
Considered using mutations. Pick a build and stick to it. At 1st I tried to make my character as if I were playing FO4. I gave him a lot of skill perks and skimped on damage and damage resistance which left him weak and frail.  Lose most of the skill, "convenience" and weight reducing perks and beef up those damage and damage resistance perks. If all else fails try this web page https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/planner/ it can help you plan out your build amongst other things. Unfortunately there is no easy way to respec in this game so you'll just have to gain more levels so you can reassign SPECIAL points as needed.
---
I’d love to see a repeatable Combat challenge for 40 atoms each...
---
“Kill 1000 Blood Eagles.”
---
Blood eagles are some of the few enemies I actually think are challenging and fun to fight. A repeatable challenge like this would give me a reason to visit each blood eagle bandit camps and just fight them Borderlands style.
---
if you're on xbone i can hook you up for free
---
I just people would stop one-shotting legendary enemies during events. Especially looking at Uranium Fever that have guaranteed spawns.
---
Where do you find that information?
---
Nope, this is what being bored while having to spend 30 minutes playing NW in order to keep up with Beth.
---
I certainly hope so. The handmade and Fixer have been at the top of the list for rifles for a long time know.
---
Im on ps4 unfortunately but thanks for the offer
---
Been playing a lot during the week since i will not get a lot of time in the next weeks, and running 15 int, have a full uny plus int set, herbivore with brain fungus for +5 int and cranberry relish for 25% extra xp and pop berry mentats for 5 more int and always in a building or event team levels you up fast.  I know i might be overdoing it but hey.
---
I thought this too it usually gets changed to its all uphill from there as going up hill is harder than going downhill.
---
Yeah I can see how for a player who has seen everything done everything how this could be a god send, but in my case it feels incredibly discouraging.
---
Sounds like possibly not having perks aligned for the weapon class?   I'm a Commando build and can double-tap crickets with a Handmade.  I picked up a .50 just to see how it felt one time and it was completely useless for me because I don't have the heavy gunner perks.   Just stood there pouring .50 rounds into enemies I could easily 1-shot with the Handmade.   
---
I love Crickets - I always need more acid and they always have a bunch.  :)
---
You can come by my camp and buy some ammo. The only thing I'm using my converter for is to convert 44 and 38 to cryo cells for freezing the queen. Otherwise I use the ammo generator or ultracite ammo.
---
What's wrong with this? Trying to earn everything for free isn't helping the game out. No one is forcing you to buy or participate, and the atom rewards from before were pretty minimal, you could get around 50-120ish a day, and around 130-170is doing the weeklys. So now you can get free stuff from the season or buy at the end, what is wrong with that model?
---
Fanboys can't handle that this game has a number of bugs that directly affect and negatively impact gameplay. I have played this game a long time. Long enough that i know that watching mobs follow me halfway across the map when i respawn to my camp and watching them destroy everything i took hours to build is just part of the game. It must be a feature, because these issues have been present since day 1.
---
Yeah the game took a nosedive since patch 20. It's awful.
---
So you're okay with the grind as long as you can pay for short cuts because it's free but, wasn't okay with the faschnact event rewarding the masks which wasn't a pay to short cut?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/gtzums/faschnact_drop_rates/fsfa74a?&amp;utm_source=share
---
Well, yeah, but even googling it, despite there being examples of it as a positive it seems like a mistake non-native speakers would make. I've never once in my life heard it used to mean things would be easier because downhill is a slope. It's just weird. I swear people just make this shit up.
---
THis request is one of the more troublesome in my opinion. I mean they have been hearing this since shortly after release and the thing I find troubling is that the code is already there. Look at bodies that get bugs over the meat piles and think of how easy it should be to make legendaries have a glowing fly swarm of a certain color of bug hovering around. This should be a simple fix....
---
 r/#Bethesda
---
Do you have any word as to when the bug will be patched? I just have one more reward and I want it soooo bad but I have work tomorrow.
---
Bitched about it earlier today 
---
https://youtu.be/huUX-OxCrc8p
---
Event groups are legit Xp on a private server where you can just chain roll the workshop events.
---
Start a one man group for the event bonus. Use any bonus xp items you want.
---
Capture the workshop for xp. Move on to next. Capture second workshop. Move on to next. Capture WS 3. By now WS 1 should have been captured by NPCs. Go retake it for another Xp bonus. Capture WS #4. Retake WS #2, etc, etc etc. Dont try to defend them, the waves are too slow to make it worth it imo. Eventually, you have time between WS recaptures to hit a few world events as well.
---
You will be perma running events for the bonus xp. If you hit a lul, you can just jump to a new private world and start the whole thing over.
---
it does not work solo, i have tried multiple mutations and perks and they are not working when you are solo in a public group
---
Actually don't want to reply to that, wow.
---
Seriously that’s good to know. I was playing scenarios in my head on how I was going to do that particular task but just gave up on it. I didn’t even know we can build camps in NW until the legendary run came out. That’s how bad I avoid PVPs.
---
empath also works by yourself in a team. you can check the angryturtle video on youtube for proof =0 
---
Use strange in numbers if people are in team and you get +4 from herd
---
Oh wow, so you haven't even played under One Tamriel. Definitely give it another go!
---
No, it’s pretty silent
---
Where did you run across it?
---
I think 25 or 30
---
Yeah, the farming's hell for carnivore though. I have to visit Whitesprings every 30 minutes or so to top up my squirrel stock, and in between launching nukes for the queen or doing my super mutant run, I have to farm the fissure sites for brains. 
---
Herbivore is definitely the easier route: Sunrise Field and Cranberry Glade provide the cranberries, and brain fungus abounds everywhere.
---
I can't switch though because I'm almost always overburdened, and I need the +75 carry weight I now get from Pepperoni Rolls.
---
Youve been a great help, thank you. I’ll check the video
---
Narrow-minded to the point you only are willing or able to find a limited way it's defined to make it fit that you are correct and I am not. You are either trolling or you really are that simple. Both ways, I have nothing more to say to you as you are bringing down the collective intelligence of mankind with comments like that.
---
I do need to give Bloodied a try.  I've been told it's huge damage.
---
Killing the queen in a few swings...wow
---
Not sure if there was anything in the patch notes but it definitely feels like its been buffed
---
Faschnadt is a completely different topic. It was out for 10 days (not 2 months) and  there wasn't an option for the following:
---
1.) Players didn't have an option to purchase all the masks from the event.
---
2.) Players didn't have a progress bar for rewards, you didn't get any points towards one of the masks or plans you wanted. 
---
3.) RNG was random, there was no system in place other then completing the event and "hopping" you'd get what you wanted.
---
I am 100% fine paying for an item I want in the game. Any other questions or concerns Benjamin?
---
Okay well I've been exclusively speaking English for the last 24 years and have heard and used it both ways. Just because you haven't doesn't mean thats not how it works.
---
The people who yell at other people like they're their fucking mom or something piss me off so bad I will *try* to do the event wrong unless they leave.
---
I was at SBQ the other day and some jackhole was yelling at people to get off the fence and away from V9 rooftop. He was being really rude, namecalling, shouting, not nice at all. So I joined them on the fence and did the robot dance on the roof of V9. Also got out the flamer and made pyrotechnics in the air. Best SBQ ever.
---
Yeah, no timebox would have allowed me the best of both worlds. I’m not one to dis companies wanting to make a little profit, after all it makes new content possible, but this kills the soul of the game. Maybe I’m in the early stages of grief and I’ll come to accept this new system, give up on obsessive score hunting, and be able to go back into immersive gameplay. But still something was significantly lost for me.
---
Yeah yeah, hypocrite rings in my head, a free update and you wasn't happy but now you saying why are people upset with a free update..   madness that.
---
Edit: an event that has RNG created mystery and continuous play time because players wanted rare items... that made the game way more fun than any MTX has.
---
I've got 40 INT and my powerfist damage is listed as 2200
---
On console you have to wait up to 30 sec/ 1 minute for the menu to become at least somewhat usable.
---
I do feel like melee on the queen is a lot of nervous waiting punctuated by a frenzied need to get damage in as fast as I can. Mop up mobs, repeat.
---
I am going to give bloodied a try soon, just to see how it goes.
---
If 2020 gets worse, I’m going to resort to that. But that is a great tip!
---
First, you’re not alone. All of us had terrible builds the first time through, with too much Dromedary and not enough Incisor.
---
Focus your build on one weapon type. If you like being in PA, go heavy, if not go Unarmed. Hybrid builds are the worst of both worlds.
---
Use Nuka Dragons to plan a build, and post it here, so experienced players can give you lots of conflicting advice.
---
There are no perfect builds. Builds don’t just reflect your weapon, but also your style of play.
---
I'm not happy when there isn't a reasonable solution for all players.
---
I can only speak from my own experience but my team tries to include a little of the Grove on the off chance it spawns the Colossus
---
I know what you mean I had to stop using my favorite gauss rifle it just missing in VATS way to much. I applaud Bethesda for the new content but can we get the base game bugs worked out before adding new ones? VATS is a pretty integral part of the FO experience.
---
Wait so they reset at midnight?
---
And this is different from marsupial....how? If you can't overcome someone jumping, then maybe fps/TPS games aren't for you.
---
Nope
---
I don't hate the Converter, I hate the clunky ui and the small screen. I mainly use it to scrap the arrows, bolts, syringes and 40mm rounds that seem to be awarded by the dozen for every event and quest. The points go to 5.56 which goes straight in vendors alongside other unused ammo.
---
I got downvoted for pointing out that your question... was pointing out how you did not read. Classic Reddit. This is a great example of why the rating system they have for users is pointless. That and you can buy it or leech it with a god fake story.
---
Same here! Glad I have had a chance to get these items again, the completionist in me is satisfied. Now I just need the VTU stuff. Hehe.
---
From playing and wondering why I can do the 10k Score challenge multiple times without levelling up once. I haven't noticed this before because I never cared about my level in the first place but when the Score thing dropped I took notes.
---
Today, for example, I levelled up to 414 and 6 10k challenges later I was still 414. Took a nuke on FSP and murdering everything that spawned there to level me up to 415.
---
Endless fast travel loops, frame drops, enemies are skipping all over the place. Its frustrating for sure.
---
I carry around my Executioner's Shovel.
---
Are you really this obnoxious? The reason players aren't happy is because this season SCORE stuff isn't for everyone.
---
If you're on PC find your fallout76.ini file in the my documents/games folder and delete it and let it regenerate on its own. That file bugs sometimes and causes incoming chat to not work. It's happened to me about 3 times already since launch.
---
Tickling the legendary moleminer is a felony offence in many of the southern states...
---
That sounds right. I haven't done today's yet but I've played since the first day and I'm at 17 and I skipped a few of the NW ones
---
The daily and weekly challenges. In other games that offer a similar pass, you're able to go back and do challenges from previous weeks. In this game, you're not able to finish anything that you missed.
---
With the sudden influx of unintelligent people commenting on my posts... That is all I have to say to this reply.
---
Yeah alright, PM if you want to
---
Health goes hand in hand with resistance. If you have huge resistance, but little health, you're boned. If you have huge health, but little resistance, same thing. Now, don't mistake it, I'm not saying max out your endurance.  However, you have to spend decent amounts on it. And on top of that, endurance also control how much ap you get. The more, the better.
---
It was super hard to kill, especially when there was like 4 of us going at it
---
Interesting. Whilst you are dead or just after?
---
I love the haevy weapons and punching stuff but i can see how that conflicts :(
---
Imma work on swaping cards and perks to get a good build
---
Thanks for the advice!
---
What do levels give you besides the SPECIAL reconfiguration that would allow for this?
---
Same although sometimes it does reward it early on like 3 of 5 tasks completed but I have also seen it reward nothing on top of the auto-complete bug.
---
So you think I’m okay with just challenges?
---
Correct. Here's my post from a couple days ago if you want the details: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hkazxw/seasons_finally_gave_me_something_to_do_in_game/
---
Like I said, easy but time consuming my friend.
---
And fuck your vieled insult.
---
Better flora like you said since 90% of the nuke zone isn't out of bounds, plus if people fight the queen from the bunker apparently her pathfinding doesn't like it when people hang out on the roof or on top of the fence where mobs can't reach, so she lands less often. Personally I think it's worth it just so people can't spam the Knight Moreno transmission over and over.
---
I have Ultracite Left Leg plan and i'm on PS4. Can give it to you, add me, my nickname is Assass1n1191
---
Luckily it rewarded most of the but I lost at least two of the weekly and a couple of the dailies due to the issue
---
So what happened!?!
---
You can't leave it ha goimg like that
---
Queen fights mostly take place at three locations, although that’s down to two since Wastelanders.  V9 and Delta are the common sites.  Fighting at the Sundew Grove was also popular, but it has a chance to spawn a Colasus now, so it’s normally nuked.  
---
I drop at least one nuke on the Queen per night.  I usually pick site Delta as the fight zone.  Just a personal preference.  It has no real advantage.
---
Are we about on track? I’m on 16. Done all weeklies, missed day one, will be at 17 after I do 3 more dailies.
---
No veiled insult at all. Simple statement of fact. Jumping in fps/TPS shooters has been around since the days of quake.
---
Usually when the people don’t agree with your issue is when you realize you might be the one with the issue. 
---
👀
---
Is the button working for you on other games and such?
---
If the numbers are yellow, then it should be a headshot, and you can headshot in or out of vats
---
herd mentality works but most other stuff requires at least one teammate like empath or strange in numbers
---
I suppose I will! I do remember one thing I liked about ESO was the dual wielding mechanic
---
But I have to get to 100 so I can see how many Monkey Steins I can place before I max my camp budget.
---
Numbers?
---
This here. Breaking them into dailies really makes them a chore. I would have much rather be able to grind more on weekends and at my own pace. My biggest gripe with Wastelanders content has been the daily nonsense. That's mobile game garbage and has no place in a fallout game.
---
This is like telling Valve to remove Scout’s double jump in TF2. Or rocket jumping. Or sticky jumping. Learn to track better. That’s legitimate advice, I’m not trying to come off as a dick. NW isn’t a PvE game where you know how enemies will behave all the time like your generic scorched or raider. There’s variables. Gotta deal with those.
---
Same here.   Seven times out of ten (or so), even when I've put zero damage on her, if I get away from the crowd and go stand in the middle of the field, she lands right in front of me.  
---
That's when the Hunter's Prime Gauss Minigun comes out....watch that health bar move.   :)
---
If they allowed cross platform progress theyd sell more copies of the game
---
From the way Bethesda describes it, nothing has changed with workshops. So if you are in the area, you should be able to attack anyone not on your team.
---
Yeah that's one of the main reasons I don't play nuclear winter, even for challenges. It's bad design, and not competitive.
---
I was on one of the new public teams, and one member was trying to get everyone over to him. I couldn't find him on the map so I just fast traveled to him, and I ended up in a nuke zone (good thing I had my power armor on). I run over to him after hearing gunfire, and I arrive to the thing towering over us as it took hit after hit (tho it was smaller than I had expected it would be). This is why I wasn't prepared for the fight, as the only gun I had was my Final Word, which I used the ammo for in like 20 seconds. I had to leave the fight for a second to get all my heavy weapons from my stash
---

Score "XP" isn't called XP in the game it's called SCORE points. That's why he didn't understand.
---
That's hard on the knees you know.
---
Sort by new and start at the bottom :) it’s all there
---
His math is based on an incorrect calendar of 11 weeks based on the loose phrasing of it ending "mid-September"
---
If you turn damage numbers on, I mean. The numbers that pop up and tell you how much damage every shot does
---
It is for everyone! You have 2 ways of getting everything! Are you suffering from something because holy crap it's like your trying to debate but you can't even put together or explain your argument!
---
 If you say there isn't an option for every player again, I'm going to spray you down with a garden hose and hit you with a 244 volt cattle prod!

Oh, shit! This person's been speaking my language for *24* years? Fucking throwing out my English degree, done teaching, I've been schooled.
---
But seriously, I learn something new every day--I'm just not sure this is it.
---
I have the ammo converter that's all I cared about.
---
You should get your hands on a magic weapon, like a shotgun or automatic rifle. Check out Angry Turtle on YT to see what I mean. Once you have one, you'll make quick work of everything that comes up to you.
---
Damn popularity ordering!
---
Ah. I didn’t even know that was a thing. Thanks!
---
The condescension is strong with this one.
---
;)
---
They better extend the season because of this shit.
---
then you're doing something wrong because as soon as i start a team i get +3 to all (and +4 to one). I could provide proof if needed. I gave away 60 herd serums over the last few days and most of them were told they'd get +3 when in a team by themselves. Nobody has come back and said i lied. 
---
Do you actually have the herd mutation listed in your effects? Some people are not getting it when using the serum. Are your mutations suppressed by any chance?
---
He's right...it HAS been different in and out of vats. I've noticed more damage out of vats than in it.
---
Can I give you a Dad Award?
---
I am.  I like free stuff.
---
I mean, I would call that a valid reason for a nuking...
---
I would be happy with any of those.  One of the biggest disappointments of this game is that so many groups you're doing missions for are wiped out, and there is zero NPC interaction.    
---
If they could bring back remnants of Free States, Mistress, etc. and rebuild the groups it would make for a lot of possibilities.    
---
I'm also a bit ambivalent about BoS, but at least it's actual NPC / story driven content.   Based on location / timing of this game they have a lot of potential for being creative with NPC factions, and BoS seems like about the least creative thing they could possibly do.
---
Same I carry mine around
---
took 5 of us twice as long as 3 of us took a few weeks ago
---
Im hearing the clicking noise but its just not targetting anything
---
I think they know how it works, but you're both calling it score XP when it's actually just called SCORE points in the game. Calling it score XP is confusing because its not called that in the game.
---
I've never seen goalposts move that quickly! Well done!
---
Actually I have a pretty good idea of how they behave. They jump around a lot. It ain't ever a surprise or something. I can't track them when they're hopping over my damn head.
---
I'm on console, I'm able to tweak the controls appropriately on most fps to be competitive. But there aren't any of the usual options in this game.
---
And there never will be.
---
Btw, I appreciate your thoughtful reply
---
Yeah, you are technically right, but people who use it the other way are wrong lol.
---
&gt; Personally I think it's worth it just so people can't spam the Knight Moreno transmission over and over.
---
Ohgod, I hate that. They need to make that instanced instead of a global broadcast. It even mutes the rest of your audio too.
---
They should venture into ohio. It's right there, maybe use the raiders that sit in the ohio river for some new lore. Maybe the Pitt. It would be cool to revisit it.

You wanna be level 20 by the end of today's challenge period :)
---
Ours was a 3 star legendary (idk if they're all like that as this is the first one I fought) so it took a long time. Definitely harder than the Scorchbeast Queen, that's for sure. Especially with that "I scream you run like a lil bitch" attack

Is this where I ask Bethesda to alter the game for me specifically?
---
You paid for the *base* game. Thats it. That is what your money bought. Everything added after release required more time, effort, and expense from Bethesda. You arent entitled to any of that new content. You want it, you pay for it or you play for it during the season it is available.
---
Yeah the grind is a drag. They were intending to add a new event with the last update but it wasn't ready. At least this grind is different from the gold grind. I've been using the XP grinding route that I last used during the christmas scorched event, with some supermutant hangouts tossed in the mix.
---
Let's just face facts here. It doesn't matter if they release 2500 hours of unending content or make score easy. As soon as everyone completes it, they are going to bitch all over again that they are bored and blah blah. The only reason I see everyone crying over score, is because they don't have all the rewards yet. And if you did, you would be crying that you have nothing to do again. Just the way the ball rolls. Everyone needs something to complain about. I just wish there was a way to filter out these posts so I stop reading them. Each one is the same as the last.
---
Play solitare if fo76 makes you unhappy
---
For those wondering, shovel locations are, whitesprings golf course, most mines, and I’ve even seen it spawn in the house at the graveyard.  But yeh if you see one, do the old drop it at the graveyard because that’s annoying as f. When it’s missing, I have a 90wr shovel so I’ve always got one on me
---
Don't worry, you missed nothing. You need to find a nuke briefcase to actually launch a nuke and it seems stupidly rare. I'm rank 51 and have found that briefcase 2 times. I even got the perk that marks the case on your compass as a freebie when ranking once and tried it out. After like 3-4 games using the perk I just gave up on it since even with that I couldn't find any.
---
12pm est
---
EDIT: ok I've made a separate post for sharing my build. [Read it here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hmhd1q/ive_seen_newcomers_struggling_with_damage_per/)
---
Personally I'm using the converter for .38, .44, grenade rounds, you know, the garbage. The stuff that sells I'm definitely still selling. The caps are more important than the piddly conversion amount. Sorry for your crummy luck!
---
People are finally getting fed up with how broken this game is, and moving on.
---
This is why I have 1st. I can't do anything but events on a public server. Anything I go to collect is gone, anytime I want to hit a location for enemies, they're dead.
---
Yea i know you can do that. Ive been doing that.
---
This system sucks.
---
I wish we just had a fallout 4 style level system.
---
Thanks bro 👍
---
Well bethesda is full of shit then, because testing shows otherwise
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY2iCu22MjU
---
I don’t know how I could be doing something wrong.  It’s just “create public team” there isn’t much to it.  And no, no rad-x suppressing mutations either.  
---
Easiest one to test has been inspirational, I even argued with someone when the teams were first released, I did a test with and without the perk slotted and there was no change in my XP gain against the same ghouls.  
---
Unless it’s a PS4 thing.  I’ll try again, I don’t have the mutation anymore (got rid of it after I saw it didn’t work, since I mostly solo anyways).  I’ll do it the old fashioned way - sitting in a vat of water
---
Oh... Well I guess I won’t be bothering to try do it again either then haha. Thanks for the tip!
---
Just copy Dead by Daylight's tome system.
---
Anytime
---
It's not about the sub or the game, the FO community is nice. Its about the context of anonymity and gaming that I'm not feeling. I'm not about to be called out of my name while exploring the wasteland. 
---
Wether it happens immediately or not is not the issue.
---
 Anything **objective** sticks to the facts, but anything **subjective** has feelings.    
---
I'm just being objective here.
---
In a game that takes zero skill thanks to things like the gauss shotgun it's completely different than TF2. Rocket jumping being useful is something that takes practice and same with sticky jumping. Scout's jump is also not that big and has a more obvious arc, but even then his overall movement speed means the scout has gotta be good to be hitting whilst staying mobile. NW lacks any reward for being good and frog legs is nothing but a crutch.
---
This is some A+ content.
---
I wonder if its triggered while wearing a full set.
---
I had two legs with ghillie on them and they acted completely fine and normal. 
---
I saw the video of someone else on here with the legs and chest floating around and being weird as hell.
---
This game is so inconsistent in its bugs it's almost astounding.
---
In a new broadcast from the brotherhood of steel, you hear them mention the atlas observatory, so I’m guessing they are setting up shop there
---
I’m fine with score but they just need to improve it. I think they should’ve made it a flat 1000 each level or 1500 and not have it exponentially grow. That or give other ways to get score such as public events.
---
I'd so say, but don't feel pressured to be. You've already gotten the ammo converter, everything else is just a skin except for that fireplace door. Personally I just want to get to 76 so I can get the T-65 skin as it's the only one available at the moment
---
I will give one more example then I'm done here. 
---
When the MH team was trying to add Lagiacrus to World they found it didn't work right. The skin fit the frame in an off way and there were issues with it clipping into the terrain. So you know what they did? They scrapped it entirely and moved on rather than releasing a sub par quality monster to the game. 
---
Now, with that in mind go take a look at the brand new, just released to the public ghillie skins for armor. You know, the ones that don't fit on the armor properly and move independently of the player. The ghillie skins that don't work as intended and were released with the first ever season, rather than moved to another season once they fixed them. 
---
That motherfucker, that is my point. The MH team gives a shit about their product and Bethesda does not. No amount of extra programmers or anything else is going to change the fact that Bethesda will release broken content and the MH team will not. 
---
There is a love for the product that MHT has that the fallout 76 team lacks. 
---
Get it now?
---
Sounds the opposite, my guy. 
---
That’s why there’s an influx.
---
No, there is another.
---
*distant whispers of "another fine day in the US Army" *
---
IT COMES FOR US ALL. THE BALLISTIC GUTSY!!
---
I still need to do this too. We can trade 1 ammo to do the daily too if you want. Psn talley54
---
PA needs a buff?  PvE is already so easy in the game to the point there is almost zero tension in combat on a completed build.  They need to buff the enemies, not the players.
---
I just like to throw at people in events because they make ridiculous sounds.
---
Oh. Maybe I should have bought it then. Sometimes I will find vendors that are selling things for ridiculously high prices. But another camp will be selling the same items for below 100 caps each. I guess I miss my opportunity to get the fixer plans
---
aye. i believe they're all the same. They seem to have nerfed the wendigo spawns as well. in the last fight they were summoned more frequently
---
Weekly quests usually reset on Tuesdays whenever they update the Atom Shop and apply any patches or hot fixes.
---
Ah that's right. Thank you for the reminder!
---
Just the amount of ammo I've wasted... fingers crossed it's on Bethesda's to do list!
---
Yes I hate the fck8ng things, but I’m 2sht gause rifle so it kinda explodes on me hurting
---
There are so many places I would like to see ... It would be lovely to vote for it :\] but I dont know how much it could mess with the lore, you know, some places we had already been.
---
Ironically, trying them is more likely to stop people buying the plans.
---
I bought the plans (before they were drops), made some, tried them, realised they competed for worst grenades ever, never bothered again.
---
The best part about them is the little wail they give out when they explode
---
👍
---
“Starts abusing me” 😂😂😂
---
Damn, I completely forgot about Biv. 
---
There's so much in this game that I realize I've never done, and I'm on my fourth character over 50.
---
I'm still in awe that they aren't using a modern engine for Starfield.
---
Better to hop from a downed state that way you don’t lose any junk you may have not stored. But it works if you get KO’ed too. All you have to do is don’t respawn on that map. Hop then respawn.
---
Yep.
---
Only verbally 😂
---
&gt;Everything added after release required more time, effort, and expense from Bethesda
---
Cute shill talk, since a ton of mtx items since launch (both camp items and outfits) "added after release" were literally nothing but structures or items that already existed in the gamesince launch (or fo4).
---
&gt;You arent entitled to any of that new content
---
Funny, people are entitled to what they paid for, nice try though with this "base game" garbage in a game where so much of it was an asset flip from fo4.  AAA Companies aren't entitled to justifications for mtx or "seasons" in paid games.
---
&gt;You want it, you pay for it or you play for it during the season it is available.
---
Lol, you want to be taken seriously then you come up with an argument that actually works instead of shilling for a asset flip game and microtransactions in paid games, not too smart to bury yourself further by mentioning "play for it during the season it is available" as if fomo is psychological manipulation is justified, Nice try though, another shill bites the dust.  Shills get the block hammer.
---
(´ー`)y-~~
---
Another 18 hrs 32 mins left it tells me
---
The sad answer is: laziness. Like many other things in this game, they are just copy/pasted from fo4. Wolves, ants, rad-rats, and crickets were DLC enemies in fo4, meaning even though they are just little pest enemies they had to be super tanky for your high level character who probably already beat the main story and got the overseer's guardian or something. Then they just ported that straight over to this game, except they were mixed in based on where it would make sense for them to be, not based on difficulty. So you can see a laughable spike in stats when comparing dogs to wolves, mole rats to rad-rats, scorpions to crickets
---
I don't have much of a problem with them, once you cripple their legs they are a joke. But they are still super tanky, hard to hit, and most importantly, they use my crops as a shield so my bullets can't even hit them while they destroy my camp
---
Delete your fallout76prefs.ini it should fix it
---
Just grill me some nice rad stag steaks lol
---
i refuse to have fun
---
Yeah mine wasn't showing the time for some reason.
---
Carnivore is a lot more valuable than Herbivore. Keep eating Pepperoni.
---
Carnivore doesn't nerf Cranberry Relish XP. But if you want the big gains, you gotta farm squirrels
---
This happened to me yesterday,  I'm primarily a bloodied sneak melee build,  but for Queen fights I bring my new favorite weapon, a zealots fast reload Cryolator.  Every time she touches down I lock her in place so other melee builds can work their magic.
---
I've found she lands much more often when I light her up from an empty field by the bunker. she landed on me like 3 times and instead of running over to take her down everyone's throwing angry emotes,  come here emotes, sending angry messages,  anything but getting off their damned tents, fences, or bunker, where she refuses to land for longer than a split second.
---
If you don't have an optimal build or gear to deal out excessive damage I highly recommend bringing a Cryolator. 
---
If not for me usually being the only one Crowd controlling her I could be putting out significantly more damage than the rest of the group combined. 
---
So long story short,  sheet or get off the fence.
---
Fence sitting was a valid strategy when she could be crippled now you significantly lengthen the fight by refusing to adapt from such a cowardly strategy.
---
Yes very similar.
---
Ah, my favorite thing to do: lure high level enemies to other high level NPCs so the NPCs will take them out. I used this a lot when I was a low level at Whitesprings. Level 62 ghouls kicking my ass? Follow me, I’ll introduce you to my sentry bot and assaultron friends.
---
Honestly just camp and you can do it in two matches.
---
My caveat to that is, if I am manning an area alone, and I'm one shotting most things, I'm not going to notice the legendary until I've already killed it. Sheepsquatch, easy not to accidentally kill.
---
Crickets in early game are awful
---
i think its datamined.  probably an atom shop addition
---
As a shotgunner, i feel your pain friend. My two shotties can each onetap a L70+ legendary at close range. The same guns cant even scratch a cargobot buzzing around 50 feet overhead at mach 3.
---
Two or three nights ago, I legit spent about 10-15 minutes trying to bring one down using random rifles from the cultists i had just gunned down because my shotgun pellets were hitting it for single digit damage at range.
---
You think its smart to complain about not being able to make the grind in order to earn rewards that are limited time only? That sounds like bitch behavior. Maybe you should stick to Candy Crush
---
This first part is absolutely wrong. I checked and confirmed last night that with Herd Mentality and solo Public Team, your character gets the benefits of the mutation.
---
since yesterday i have the opposite.  i think the average is probably still the same
---
&gt; Bethesda's secret plan to make us pay.
---
You mean the one they have stated in multiple ITVs for weeks before the event came? The one that they addressed multiple times and made explicitly clear on their social media, that secret plan? They're grindy for a reason, that is their PURPOSE. If they wanted to give everybody free skins and gear for an event, you would get it in a big bundle upon logging in. But you don't, because they want you to keep playing and eventually keep paying if it means that much to you. Their intent is not to give everybody all the rewards, and acting as if it was is nothing more than entitlement
---
is it a dumb mechanic, yes, is it  going anywhere? doubt it. most games pvp modes have devolved into more speed = more fun!!11 or button mashing. id love a mode where your character cant jump the equivalent of 2 stories straight up, or run 85 miles per hour, i just dont think youll ever see too many games like that again.
---
It's all downhill from here is used to imply ease. It's only downhill from there or it went downhill from there is used to imply that it gets/got worse.
---
Kinda old thread but i wasnt questioning their INT. I can get that INT with that dmg but thats bc my stg is also over 40 too. What i was questioning the OP over was how they were pulling those dmg numbers at 13STG AFTER unyielding ect. But i was under the assumption it was the same build they used for those melee numbers they showed, but that wasnt the case i found out. Hope that clears it up.
---
Boots are dirty brother. I would rather use less stims and have a better advantage in vats. I will continue stacking...im sorry you dont approve.
---
Unfortunately it really makes no difference. I did raiders my wife went with settlers and the outcome is the same either way. Nothing changes in the settlement, they're not improved or upgraded or affected in any way. There is no new dialogue or options available at one that would be missed by chosing the other. Only real difference is the set up missions and the approach to the final heist. Also you can still reach max reputation in both. 
---
Really it just depends on who you like better.
---
Lol imagine comparing phone games to box games. It must be summer vacation time.
---
Mistress of mysteries story arch (with the option to become a "Silver Shroud" character if you want the choice between femine/masculine clothing) 
---
Enclave story arch - let MODAS reclaim and run Whitespring! 
---
Supermutants - A friendly faction of supermuntants would be nice, especially if we find out the master is active! 
---
The Raiders/Settlers - a lot more development for them. Personally I think it would be cool to see the raiders start to have more outposts in the north, and settler in the south. I want to see them turn into more of a faction, maybe at some point merging into one with the raiders becoming the militant portion of the faction, and the settlers becoming the builders and farmers to keep them all fed. 
---
New locations - as the game is developed, I would like to see West Virginia turn more into a developed city(not completely obviously), and new locations added outside of WV for us to explore and possibly help develope. 
---
BONUS THINGS I WANT TO SEE
---
Race selection - Let me be a ghoul or a supermutant dangit.
---
Many lives start - it's been a year since the Vault has opened, so let me start outside the vault (would be lore friendly for race selction)
---
More support items - for example, If I sided with the raiders or settlers (or reached allied) give me a radio so i can call in for assistance once a day (or for caps).
---
A ton more on my mind but I could go on for days.
---
I don't like what they did to the alien blaster in 4 or 76.
---
It sucks, and in a lot of ways. For one the medic legendary just *doesn't* work in this. I get the fire rate is crazy high, but you aren't killing a single 68 ghoul with this gun unless you're spending 300 rounds, taking a ton of damage, and wasting half the gun's condition.
---
That's with all three full ranks of Gunslinger.
---
It's strictly a novelty, but I guess at least the new skin looks less busted than the broken glowing box effect it got in 4.
---
I've tried to make this work in my build, the only thing it's good for is quickly getting a crit banked. Having to switch in and out of it in combat feels rough though, hardly worth it.
---
Beth to dumb to copy/paste these keywords on the fixer

Which repeatable quest are you using?
---
ok thanks !
---
It still lands regardless of the tent placement though. It really doesnt matter.
---
Just the 10k exp one that’s the only one we can do as much as you want
---
Thats it! Thank you
---
What does building do for you?
---
I know, but me wants all that cool stuff!
---
In all honesty, I’m a level 247 and I haven’t had this problem at all. I’ve just done plenty of events, join event groups, and eat a canned meat stew. I’ve been able to level up every day since the S.C.O.R.E came out
---
I’m at like 16. Is that ok?
---
It's actually a +20% base damage boost, making it more powerful than the Handmade rifle
---
If I fall a few ranks short of the Items I really want for my camp I'll gladly fork over a few bucks to clean house. I got no problem with paying for aesthetically pleasing cosmetics that allow me to fully customize my experience. 
---
The items I'm getting now are already wildly increasing the options I have to make my camp a truly unique experience for visitors. 
---
Once I have those skeleton items it will be unstoppable!
---
Thats the recurring challenge THIS week. Now it may be the same for all 10 weeks, or it might be there are different recurring challenges.
---
Submit a ticket, posting it here isn’t going to do anything.
---
Yeah saw these - just wondering why the "Revive 76 players" challenge has no atom reward against it
---
Not every week gets a patch, hot fix, or maintenance. But if you wanted to find out Bethesda’s forums are the official source.
---
Fact. Any time I’m biking and I am coasting down a hill I enjoy the moment, but know that I’m going to have to bike back up the hill on my back. So, I think “it’s all down hill from here.😆😭”
---
Works both ways
---
Melee is pretty bad too. VATS is almost useless right now.
---
Thats what I originally thought tldr meant. Now to me, it does
---
I see them all the time on my private servers so they can and do spawn naturally.
---
9th-13th is the sale.
---
I believe it starts on July 9th
---
Why do you have to finish it? I also think you get enough atoms to skip a few levels if you wait. I see some stuff I like and after I get there (dark matter combat rifle skin and blood eagle handmade skin)
---
I’m not sure how much I’ll care. This communities need to finish everything is admirable but nuts. Also the 10,000 xp is very easy to stack in events groups.
---
Same with Enclave Plasma.
---
They need to do a small amount of work to set each skin up as a skin mod, instead of the default weapon skin, to allow toggling back and forth on each.
---
It's really easy to do.
---
Increases Intelligence and if you got a full team its a X4 bonus once your bonds form.
---
People on the fence around the dropsite are worse.
---
They aren't broken.  They're one of the very few enemies in this game that actually presents something resembling a challenge.
---
Brilliant idea. I mostly just read posts while hiding for 30 minutes. I made it to top 10 both times too!
---
I’d like to see them either decrease the growth in cost in moving from tank to tank or an increase in the value of doing events.
---
I'm at level 341. Just feels like a bit much to do *everyday*.
---
Not much use now, but for future challenges - you can complete them building in workshops. Although it costs a handful of caps to claim it, you can then build all the horrendous structures you need without worrying it will mess up your home camp.
---
That is why I always carry the All Rise on me.  My security blanket is a light weight rocket hammer!
---
Still takes 30+ minutes
---
The whole point OP is trying to make is there IS no wrong way to play the game for fun. To win, perhaps there are several ways but none is "correct". If the low level is getting XP or even just fun from it, what's the problem? Want it your way? Go private.
---
Fallouts seasonal rewards are much less important than destiny 2’s as they are basically entirely cosmetic currently with one new feature unlocked at lvl 5. I’d definitely prefer if it stayed this way as well because I used to be a destiny 2 player and I agree that what they did with limited weapons, armor, lore, activities and missions for their season ruined the whole experience for me and I haven’t played since.
---
Hmmm...I don’t know if this is purposeful or Bethesda is missing something here. They do understand that a metric shit ton of nukes are going to be dropping right on top of where they have decided to park the BoS as well.
---
Seriously? Please tell me this was planned. Please tell me someone isn’t asleep at the wheel in BGS.
---
If the BoS doesn’t show up to your personal camp to murder you after nuking them, I don’t want to play this game anymore.
---
Upped to flat 10 percent spawn rate
---
This is one of the greatest posts I've read on this subreddit. Really engaging and well written. It encompasses everything I am currently enjoying about the game.
---
Yeah they are, the upcoming community challenges are for us to build up the facility for them for when they arrive
---
I agree with you
---
Gratz!
---
I don't so much care about people's tom foolery. BUT, people with beam splitters on weapons that shouldn't have them like the 50cal machine gun, gatling laser, gatling plasma and the handmade all ruin events when they just mow everything down in 2 seconds. Yes, queen included.
---
I hobble down to Big Bend tunnel exit/entrance to sell as much stuff as I can to the traders there. Nearer than Watoga
---
I also meant to say after he killed me that he gave me plans for the bear claw. I guess kind of a "I'm not a bad guy, just a PVP type guy" gift. 🤣🤣🤣
---
Why would you assume that? I told them I was running bloodied and I would not tank a pylon with only 2 people there. Then the guy started to swear and bitch and moan. After the event he joined my public team to continue griefing me. Once he told me to drown myself, I called it a day and blocked him.
---
Dead Detector
---
Will be under Perception
---
Rank 1 will highlight dead corpses with a bright blue light
---
Rank 2 will do rank 1 in addition to highlighting legendary corpses with a bright green light
---
Highlight like how Ark does when you die.
---
I don't think words can describe how lucky you are lmao
---
Some people are dicks
---
Okay thanks good just wanted to make sure I wasn’t saving up for no reason
---
What is the discount this time?
---
no. the wendigo spawns!
---
the wendigos it spawns.
---
Sunnytop Ski Lanes. It’s in the upper middle map. SE of the Palace of the Winding Path, due West of the Pumpkin House!
---
It’s been Monday in the past
---
uh, that is what TLDR means.
---
Xbox it must be easier for us to use or somthing
---
I've been saving up also, 25% off will be nice.
---
Yes. If you have the blueprint available in your "stored" tab, you still have 1 active convertor.
---
25% off.
---
they ban people?
---
It’s because you have too much stuff at your camp or have some extra stuff that you stored instead of scrapped. There’s a bar on the right side while in build mode that indicates how much free space you have to place something
---
Unfortunately PS4
---
Ooh the Pitt before the events of fo3 would be interesting
---
so, it is still free, they don't are obligated to give you anything other than the content you brought, the base game. like you sayed free, still free.
---
And? It’s cumulative and isn’t that bad.
---
Dont get me wrong I do too but sometimes I'm lazy and have the caps to throw around
---
Machea96 my ign
---
U pc too?
---
Never had any bug out on either Playstation or Xbox so I have no idea what you are talking about
---
Yup!
---
Dude No one wants to flip through pages and pages of crap
---
The description of it says if teammates are nearby though.
---
So it will give a positive effect of they are not nearby?
---
Mine was level 20. Why waste my time even trying it?
---
Must have been on the long list.
---
1. I’ve actually used this weapon on a level 68 ghoul but it didn’t take even half a clip. If you use vats like your meant to (with concentrated fire) and target the head then it should not take more than a single clip to kill a ghoul. It probably wouldn’t even take all of the clip if you targeted the torso.
---
2. Each shot barely takes condition so it shouldn’t take such a large chunk of your condition bar (or even a large portion of it for the matter).
---
What is the point of being that high of level. Im 320 and see no benefit after getting all of the perks the way you want them
---
I had a player blow up at me recently for starting line in the sand by accident. I didn't know why everyone was just standing around, so I just followed the quest text and interacted with the terminal, before I knew it this dude starts calling me out by username and telling everyone there how much of a jackass r@#$#d I was for the length of the event. 
---
I've mostly been sticking to private worlds since then.
---
They are quite literally broken. Ive had them engage me on multiple occasions through walls and terrain. One time in Penny Horwrights mansion i got hedlasered through three walls while \[HIDDEN\]. I heard the windup, glanced at my stealth indicator, assumed she couldnt see me, then died. 
---
Having said that, i have since progressed to the point to where i can oneshot them with my stealth shotgunner. I still think they are bullshit. And as another post mentioned, their Ai seems to get a bit weird around stairs.
---
On another occasion, just this weekend, the Assaultron at the RRocket megastop decided after i oneshotted her, that instead of falling down dead, she would teleport into the middle of a nearby table and continue fighting. I onehsot her again. She teleported out of the table, then killed me.
---
Try it if you want to provide a challenge for yourself. Or not, I don’t care 🤷
---
I'm guessing your account got hacked/brute forced and then sold for $1.50 on one of them websites, then purchased and used for naughty purposes.
---
Kevduit (?) actually has video that shows his wife's account being used by somebody else without her knowing it lol
---
If that's accurate, and I doubt that it is, it hasn't been on a Monday for a long time.
---
I deleted the one with it and it did not store
---
Pewpewpewpewpew
---
Which also would be particularly curious given o haven't cheated and only got to like 20ish level
---
Maybe someone stole your account and used it to exploit
---
How is this not the top comment? It's true.
---
I have a qffr gamma and vffr handmade. Was hoping that would do it. Gamma ammo is a bitch though.
---
Then it might be bugged, have you tried restarting?
---
not that i am aware of, but here is the link to the wiki.  [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Jack\_o%27lantern\_paint](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Jack_o%27lantern_paint)
---
I've had a couple fall through the map in front of me.
---
I main the sorcerer. Love it. Dual wielder builds are pretty powerful, but I'm not very good with them. I can't quite figure out the ability to effectively use them
---
Oh it’s 25% off (tbh ain’t discount is better then full price) hopefully I can find something good
---
I had to buy a shovel at  train station just so I could finish the stupid daily
---
I'm a pistol build and I've been trying to make this gun work since I bought a level 50 version after the game gave my level 200+ self the level 20 variant. It's an energy gun so to most enemies it *tickles.*
---
I use Concentrated Fire and headshots and I'm looking at a dozen or more shots to take out a single ghoul. I don't use the sneak 2.5 damage as 2x seems enough and that's 3 AGI more than I can afford.
---
Please show me your magic ways, because I'd love to think this gun doesn't suck. Medic's is really just broken then?
---
I can't even one shot level 5 robots half the time.
---
Edit: Starting from stealth, which this gun breaks because no silencer, it took me 17 headshots to kill a glowing level 40 radstag.
---
I agree.  The beauty of a Fallout game is being able to pick a direction and see what you find.  Even after over 1400 hours in I still found myself doing this, finding random encounters, looting junk, looking for bits of lost lore, or exploring an area I haven’t been to in a while.  This aspect of gameplay is currently lost to me.  Now my game play often consists of:
---
Three daily quests for treasury notes
---
Additional public events for more treasures notes
---
Daily challenges
---
Either grinding xp for a level for the challenge or playing on a lowbie character to gain a level
---
Playing NW, which I have no interest in, for SCORE
---
If I have chosen to do this grind, which I don’t always do, I don’t even want to bother playing afterwards or don’t have time to do anything else due to RL.
---
I really really do not understand Bethesda’s fear of content that can be completed at ones choosing. In other words no time gates.  So what if someone wants to burn through it quickly, who cares.
---
Interesting. Thanks for the info.
---
I'm not sure what the problem is, your getting score all throughout the normal daily grind for gold and scrip. 
---
Theres only a handful of tasks that might require you to divert from your normal routine but even then if you grab dailys and events along the way your still building both up together. 
---
The added grind is more so if you want to close the gap faster utilizing the repeatable XP gain after you've essentially completed all the major tasks.
---
Are we even sure at this point that the +25 score per rank will always be going up nonstop? Has anyone made it to chapter 2 or 3 yet to confirm that?
---
And are we even sure if the repeatable challenge will always be XP? Might shift weekly and be even easier to farm later.
---
The small of it is that its only really an added on grind if your going about it in a really inefficient way.
---
Stay grouped at all times and keep a stack of the easiest to acquire xp food you usually come across.
---
Did you read the original post? How can people struggle to grasp what i am saying? 
---
No matter how good you are at NW it's gonna take 30+ minutes. And i'm saying that time could be spent in adventure mode and they could easily get 200+ score points in the same time. While also getting junk and ammo and aid and drops.
---
I think they should really lower the price of those cards. In like 300 hours of gameplay I've only see the event up like 4 times. 
---
Maybe if the cards were only like 500 caps it wouldn't be so rare.
---
This post should kinda give you an idea of the levels

---
Same crap happens at vendors too. Been around since launch and im sure they have no care to fix this.
---
Cheers, I'll have to begin saving my daily scrip then.
---
Do it for all of them! Raiders, Settlers, etc. Raider and Settler dailies. Random encounters. No reason any of those should be a challenge.
---
Yeah, I saw it. Do you really think it’s accurate?
---
https://images2.imgbox.com/47/fd/iAjS3UTj_o.jpg
---
Apparently so.
---
I'm saving this post because I'm level 82 and feel like my build is weak. I need to modify it quite a bit
---
Yes they did not fix it
---
Seriously!!! I back the hell out of that suggestion. Turning off the grass helps a little sometimes.
---
yeah, this game is going the freemium MMO route, which is not surprising but it's definitely not appealing to me. Already disliked how they gated and monetized content, but ignored it cause I liked the world. Was fun while it lasted, but I'll stick to games that don't make content a grind/pay situation like this.
---
This is by far the worst of the NW we’ve had so far.. takes too fucking long.
---
lol  i can keep 20, i do keep my stash at a minimum so i don't worry about the weight
---
I just got a new pc so I stoped playing for 2 weeks and I come back and I feel like I’m already WAYYYY behind
---
OH!!!  Of course.  I wasn't even thinking.  Thank you for clarifying that!  :)
---
You should still take any codes you find, just so that when the planets align and you do find a nuke case you can launch it and complete the challenge for your free perk card.
---
Also, your team mates can drop codes for you and you for them. My second nuke I was only able to launch because people gave me codes, then it didn't even kill anyone lol.
---
12 i think. i don’t have much free time to play lately. i will end up reaching 100 one way or another ugh
---
What kind of builds are there for the game anyways? I can’t remember much of my short time playing it
---
Apparently I missed the part where Battle Passes were meant to reward even the most casual player with all the rewards? 
---
I always thought it was a case of giving all players some rewards based on the ability to complete challenges. More dedication= more rewards, but even if you can't be as dedicated, you still get some rewards. 
---
Boy I'm an idiot.
---
You bet. Anything for another juicer! Been getting my INT to 58 on best days and I only have the stat specced to a 8. 500+ XP for a lvl 68 mutant.
---
You learned him good paw your learned him good. Props.
---
I couldn’t say one way or the other I didn’t do any math or anything lol. but theirs gonna be a double score daily weekend soon so you could always make up some levels then but far as I know I think only the daily’s will give double score for that weekend not the weekly quest
---
not as often, instead of once every minute it took at least 5 minutes between each landing because she would target the tent guy
---
Great breakdown. I have a very similar build and almost all of these weapons. DPS is extremely important particularly  with Scorched Earth. Nice work.
---
I made it to 17. I hope I’m doing okay
---
You're spot on, my bad.  Thanks for pointing that out, edited my original comment to reflect this fact
---
Well and while I’m working from home. I can bush camp and still work 😉
---
Well ain't that peachy. If that's the case, there's Doom Eternal on that account, imagine using it to cheat in fallout 76 instead...
---
Yeah. So that's just a blatant lie. 
---
Most he companies are generous like that? Other battle passes give all rewards for completing half the challenges? Bull. Shit. Not true. Not even close.
---
A few people didn't believe me when I said this wasn't going to be free. 
---
I guess technically I was right. 
---
You can hit max tank in Destiny 2 and The Division 2 well ahead of the season's end. But that's because they want you to hit max tank since they have a free and paid tier.
---
This score system is NOT for us who can't play everyday.
---
Puts up a fight to keeps it's juicy acid. GIMME
---
Being logged in when it resets screws you over.  Log off when its close to resetting and wait till its done.
---
As the other person said message support.
---
For starters, just complete the astronauts quest and get yourself a lvl 50 variant. Second,just have fun with it. It’s not meant to be used like a legit weapon. That’s why I said that it’s like the paddle ball and the commie wacker, it does suck buts don’t take it seriously :)
---
Also: it’s useful for marking legendaries without killing them so that you can share it with a team.
---
No but they just like to cry instead of doing something as easy as getting off before resets
---
Agreed. Deploy camps was the best. Done in less time than it took to load in.
---
That'd be just perfect
---
I noticed that too during my Daily runs.  Noticed when playing my lvl 332 that id killed 76 aquatic creatures im like ok. 
---
Thanks for the atoms.
---
Totally fair! Lol Best of luck!
---
Oooh gotcha. I didn't understand that but I follow now. That would be awesome!
---
Guess It can't be done on consoles
---
Takes me 8 shots to finally start doing damage in vats with shotty build. Unsustainable my good man
---
Take pictures is even easier, you don’t need to leave the lobby!
---
There is raider glitch that you can exploit to get max rep for them it will still take awhile, but if you’re fine with doing that then I’d say settlers just to get that extra rep with them.
---
Part of it was a personal goal of reaching 1000. I also have every level of every perk card so I can continually tweak my build. I’m always trying out new weapons and ways of playing even though I DO have my favorites.
---
This one worked. Everyone, follow this tip and forward it. I tried everything, many times, and it always failed, except this one.
---
I'd settle for the challenges working as expected, and SCORE in public events.
---
Yeah, I *did* the Daguerre quests. I was over 150 at the time but she still gave me a level 20, so I had to buy a level 50.
---
Nope, they are shit poo poo tier but f76 is super casual so you can easily make it work for most content.
---
Orrrr...throw nuka grenades at them.
---
Same same.
---
(Note: not the same).
---
Events should give score. Would elevate the heavy ass grind one needs to do and even make most dailys optional.
---
They also said that just earning exp would also be a way of earning score. This is there way of doing that.
---
Wow 😮 You have a good kid there, who even at his young age knows what to do &amp; when to do it to help out his fellow man (or in this case survivor). You’ve taught him well clearly 😊👌 Well done &amp; high five your son too for what he did 😊
---
they are currently not available.
---
short answer on their return, only bethesda knows, and to my knowledge they haven't told.
---
personally, i think it is laughably absurd to have limited time exclusives for a paid subscription service.  the value for such a service should be cumulative, but here in 76 land, it is all kinds of wonky.  elder scrolls online does something of the sort with these mini statues, BUT one is always available.  every few months or so, the current goes away, but a new one is added.  so while you might miss out on some, there will always be a new one for you to grab.
---
at the bare minimum they should do something of the ilk in here, but nope, if you missed it, you missed it.  for now, maybe, but heaven forbid we get a clear unfiltered by shareholders word out of bethesda.
---
ask for proof. then demand recompense. even if you don't intend to play again.
---
I hate that event and only join if i see enough people doing it, but they need to lower the card price the event rewards aren't enough to justify it
---
My level 40 shotgun build always draws her aggro...but once she gets on the ground she goes for everything but me
---
Ah you are correct. I forgot about that one!  I didn't do the revive players one though, way too much work.
---
I've been running railway rifles for a while because they fail in much lower percents than any other kind of ballistic rifles
---
Ah that was easy too.. I even did a post on that

---
that helped me once, long ago, but i'm at the point where we'd be talking at least a week of downloading to get the files again.
---
No. They are fun novelty type of weapons. But they have no place in end game activities. Just too weak dps because of the slow fire rate etc. They do alright if you are slowly killing normal enemies while doing dailies etc..
---
Whenever I can I like to give any new players i come across food, water, ammo, and if they're around 50 i craft them a full set of heavy BOS combat armor
---
The damn quest was probably bugged then.
---
The general consensus (and one that has been fail proof for me so far) is when you stop playing, make sure you end in adventure. I play well after the new challenges launch. Do not open anything (atom store legendary map nothing). Go straight into adventure and finish them all before NW. Do NW dead last.
---
Every time I say this I get the "we shouldn't have to" speech and I get it. This is a rough ride for sure.
---
But something I learned early in life that has translated into successful situations in general. I don't deal with the world based on how you want it. You deal with it based on how it is. Our only choices right now is to do our best due diligence (by helping others), keep stressing it's broken and hopefully enjoy the game. Hope this helps and hope it doesn't happen again to you. And hope after almost 2 years of a broken challenges system this finally forces their hand! 🙏.
---
exactly
---
I did. I don't particularly care about f76, only posting this because I figured you guys might find it as funny as I did
---
I only get to play for 2 or 3 hours a day . I dont have a clue how people get so much xp . I am open to any advice
---
I agree and sympathize.
---
Oh so many. Of course there are meta, best in slot kind of builds, but you have a lot of freedom to just put together something that you find fun. Only the hardest encounters in the game (veteran trials) sort of require you to be best in slot, but I've also successfully completed a few of them while below spec-- mainly because I was running with guildies, and we were a pretty damn good team.
---
Check out [Alcast](https://alcasthq.com/) and [Deltia](http://deltiasgaming.com/elder-scrolls-online/). They both have some fantastic builds. I personally prefer Alcast builds because I enjoy the flexibility. He has a bunch of builds for every character and play style. Deltia's are less flexible (or they were when I was still playing every day), but I've had fun using them. 
---
Ultimately, if you're focusing on solo content, your build doesn't really matter. I prefer to go through solo content as a DPS so that I can shred in combat and experience more of the story in less time. I recommend leveling as a DPS, but with skill lines for whatever you want to play thrown in so that they level. For example, when I leveled my healer to level cap, I played primarily DPS, but threw in healing abilities so that they would be somewhat ready to use when I hit level 50. You can always respec and run easy content to level those later, as well.
---
No matter how you want to play, enjoy yourself! Talk to everyone. Read all of the lore books. Experience everything that Tamriel has to offer. I would say, without hesitation, that ESO has more lore than the entire rest of the ES series combined. There's so much to it. The main story is great, the overarching story being slowly brought together by the addition of chapters is fantastic, and there are so many lore books to read that you could spend hours doing just that.
---
I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!
---
Th alien blaster should be an incredibly high damage output weapon like it was in fallout 3, it also should not be in this game for that reason.
---
It's about the loot, not the xp. You can knock out a decent percentage of your daily 1400 cap sell limit just by offloading the loot from mole miner drops. 
---
That's why I run around with my weakest gun and tag everyone once. The whole point of that event is to get easy loot drops, but that doesn't happen when some loser with an explosive minigun one shots everything.
---
Get any LEGO games. You can both play together at the same time, and there's a lot of adult humor in them.
---
Based on the hate I see often for this game I should probably seek mental health services. I'm level 405 and still enjoying the game. Glad you are too!
---
Well are you only getting on just to do the S.C.O.R.E and then get off?
---
Your first assumption is right, the level of the armor or weapon is the level the player has to be to use them. IMO I don’t think power armor is worth it until higher levels. By higher levels you will have accumulated a lot of fusion cores and enough power armor pieces to make a full set
---
It’s all about the time you have available to play a video game.  Some adults have the summer off from school, others are furloughed or lost their job, some work eight hour days, some work longer shifts but have more days off, others travel part of the week.  Every player has varied times they can dedicate to a game each week.  Restricting rewards/progression to one set daily schedule is ludicrous and it alienates a portion of the working adult player base.  This isn’t suppose to be a mobile game.
---
Man I've been looking for ages for a shishkebab just like yours for the exact same purpose. I've found more bloody handmades than 90% reduced shishkebabs.
---
What's your GT?  I will take a look in a few hours and see if I have those.
---
Cards are expensive but a good cap sink as you progress. 
---
I run this event several times a week. Easy way to drop 10k caps for 5 cards and run event for  possible fixer plans etc. 
---
Also it give more people a chance at those plans to so it's become one of my favorite events to do as a high level
---
I just get a message somebody sent me a friend request and nothing else. Sorry yall
---
You will probably get down voted but i completely agree with what you are saying.
---
My theory is that the f76 community is super casual so any hurdle or a time consuming endeavor is considered to be unfair.
---
You don't see WoW, D3 or PoE players complain this way. Most MMORPGS tend to welcome the grind. People in f76 expect things to be handed to them with only 1 hour of play time a day. I see posts complaining about the legendary mob and level up challenge and it boggles my mind.
---
Just watch the comment section be all like " we don't have time, it's a cash grab, what about atoms?, score should be 50 levels" and blah blah blah.
---
If you are using demolition expert solely for explosive bullets, then I wouldn't bother at all. Use something else.
---
Yes. I remember when the game came out i would always run out of ammo before defeating the queen!
---
I do this event daily and usually after an sbq. This way I get an understanding of the playerscape. If someone tanks sbq too hard I won't do it. If it takes us nearly the entire allotted time to kill sbq I won't do it. If it takes the right amount of time and players to take down and sbq (and people popped those lunchboxes) I go.
---
Yeah, but if you use a magic gun at the SBQ, kill all ground enemies with one hit and melt the Skyrim dragon in two seconds, you're a selfish asshole and I'm going to get on that mic and shame you. Those events are co-op and if you can't share with others, hit up a private server and save people from having to put up with you.
---
Mostly garbage, but I have a quad ffr crossbow that I can clear westek with. In sneak of course.
---
*everyone liked that*
---
Definitely a lucky roll heh
---
but even a normal one only weights 3 so it's no big deal!
---
Aka 35-40 minutes
---
Well rested, leader bobblehead, cranberry relish. My favorite xp run is to start at the power substation north of Watoga (level 91 deathclaw), Huntersville, WesTec, National Isolated Radio Array, General’s Steakhouse, then Harper’s Ferry. These locations spawn high level Super Mutants. Repeat as often as you like. By the time you tech the end of the run, things should be respawning. If not, world hop.
---
Thanks,AC was not talking so I tried it today without skipping and he started talking
---
The best total resistance armor is heavy combat with brotherhood of steel mod, but shadowed helps sneaking. The 2nd mod slot is usually quality of life mods. Sleek helps sneaking. 
---
There are plenty of armors. Once you hit 50, legendary armor is easier to come by and whatnot. 
---
This link has all combat armor mods on it. [combat](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Combat_armor_(Fallout_76))
---
Not sure why you've been downvoted; you're right.
---
Same here on XB1x with a SSD. It seems menu's are neigh impossible to use unless your the most patient gamer around. I can tell you I have all but stopped playing after 2k+ hours and it is solely due to inventory management sucking the fun out of the game and cooking/crafting/storing menus being so fucking slow.(To even stock my vendors take what might be my only 2 free hours that day to play.(And I mean one vending machine forget the other three.)
---
Thing is, the fixer plan is barely worth 1000 caps these days due to duping. It will be a while before that returns to normal.
---
Still a fun event though.
---
The problem is others fun is afking in events or trying to horde the legendary kills instead of let other get a hit on it. I dont like when people speak condescendingly but peoples version of fun is sometimes straight garbage.
---
Teach . Your children well .
---
I sell ammo every day on Xbox if you need it. Usually 5.56, .45 &amp; 50. Feel free to add me GT: Freestateepp
---
Funny, I read that the other day. Didn't realize you were the writer. Getting someone to coordinate with is what broke it for me though.
---
You are aware of that filters exist for this very reason, right? But if they did implement text chat, they would need to revamp their report function, as it currently is useless unless you feel like filling out a low rent police report.
---
Ah well if you’re on PC hit me up next time and I’ll gladly help you out..
---
If by stealthily you mean it's a glitch that has Xmas, Halloween and the Survival rewards unlocked, yes lol
---
So as others have said, some incorrect info in the comments. It DOES work solo on a public team
---
Yes it's a bug right now. Currently you can get all the Halloween items, christmas items and you can get the ghillie suit if you missed it the first time around.
---
There seems to be a weird bug where a given instance of VATS never hits, regardless of what the percentage says. You need to back out of VATS and go back in to fix it.
---
This gets super annoying since it compounds the problem with the weird enemy HP rubber-banding, since the only way to get around that is to use VATS in the first place. Se when that breaks too, it's even more annoying. Bugs within bugs.
---
[Step 1]Build it in C.A.M.P.
---
[Step 2] Follow the on screen prompts
---
[Step 3] Seek professional help regarding your recent anger/depression issues.
---
Yeah you're right. Thanks for the tip.
---
If that’s the best you got, you may want to sit your ass down and keep to yourself.
---
I can only do this season because I'm still out of work till September after that I have no chance with work and travel taking up about 15 hours of my day 5 days per week
---
If I'm forced to join an Event group, the first thing I do is launch a nuke at Fissure Prime. No dilly-dallying about in my watch; we gonna XP whether you like it or not.
---
I'm on Xbox, my gt is my name. I have DOZENS of mounted head plans in my vendor.
---
You haven’t worked plumbing, 2 rules, shit goes downhill and never eat the crusts of ur sammich
---
As a bloodied sniper, I never activate a pylon. I sit crouched as far away from danger as I can and I snipe the robots as best I can, then shoot the imposter while the shields are down.
---
That's the best I can do to contribute. There are players that run full.health builds so that's what they should be doing, we all have our part.
---
It’s a visual glitch that’s been going on a long time. The outer ring is not actually radiated.
---
Appreciate it, but PS4 for me. Still always nice to converse with another bush wookie!  Enjoy tomorrow's NW challenge...I know I probably won't lol.
---
xp requirements for lvling up are the same from lvl 100-999
---
It works 60% of the time, all the time!!
---
I'll be on in about 30 minutes
---
Its Pete Simsy
---
Honestly the 1st time you use a vendor it probably takes down the time, than each time you visit the vendor of the same type checks to see if that time is more than 20 hours. If so it replaces the time and resets the vendor balance, if not it shows the previous balance (caps, script, exc). Doesnt take more than a couple lines of code to write and maybe 1 line of code attached to the player
---
I’ll add you!
---
Once you get to a high enough level everything works. Just have fun and use the appropriate pistol perks!
---
I was like whaaaat the fuuuck is going on. Had never seen or heard of it before, thought maybe Enclave had finally showed up to the party haha
---
Right, but the divedends for investing in end are not worth it, not even kinda. Same with lifegiver, not even close to worth the cardslots.
---
Lol!!
---
It may not be new but that's 1 reason I swapped from XBox to PC; different friends to play with, no support network, new toons without all the shiny toys, and that's offset by a little bit of knowledge

---
Even if you don't do that -- brilliant idea, BTW -- just chaining nukes at the queen does wonders. Do scorched earth thrice in succession in an Events team and if you don't level up you're _really_ doing something wrong.
---
I can’t change your mind because I totally agree with ya...
---
If I could take the Dark Matter skin from seasons when I finally get it and put it on a fixer to replace the baby sh*t green color, I’d probably seek out a fixer to use.
---
No, just the white one with red trim, goes with the baseball cap. Source: https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Baseball_uniform_(Fallout_76)
---
FYI: The mirelurk queen claw is not available yet, hasn't dropped in the game so far, don't worry about that one, it should drop in the future, don't know when though...
---
If they ever released an auto doc, it would be broken and insanely overpriced. Maybe even an exclusive atom shop item for 1,000 atoms.
---
Thanks for the reassurance! I'm definitely overthinking it, just gotta play and figure out what works well.
---
24 here and I was feeling like I was behind lol.
---
More like accidentally. Seems they reverted the NW change to the tesla too.
---
Lag with almost everything in some form or other.
---
Whenever i got on public servers they are always full. I mostly play on private doe, i assume most high levels do.
---
Similar, but mostly playable without frequent issues.
---
Bloodied stealth sniper here too, this time round
---
Oh really?? Darn I had spot for it and everything :/ thanks for the info tho!
---
I loved my crossbow build, until they decided crossbows would no longer benefit from rifle perks.
---
That pissed me off quite a bit, there's no way I'm picking perks that are only usefull do an obsolite weapon type when I can do everything better with rifles.
---
This will be even more necessary once the smoothbrain "dead enemies explode" legendary perks send everything flying over the mountains.
---
Thank you! And will do!!
---
Seriously, every system in this game doesn’t seem to be made with the player in mind, but the bottom line. The bottom line being daily log ins. 
---
Sure I can grind away for hours getting gold bullion, but I can only deposit 20 at a time daily. 
---
Yeah, I can hop around locations legendary hunting, but I’m limited to a daily limit of 150. Easy to hit this max.
---
Settler and Raider reputation. Seriously? Only one fetch quest a day each? 
---
Caps. Daily limit of 1400 and purchasing from vendors isn’t even 1:1. If there’s stash space I need to clear and the limits been hit, gotta log in tomorrow.
---
Now there’s SCORE that requires that you not only log in, but also complete every daily and weekly to even have a chance at getting close to the level 100. These artificial caps combined with layers upon layers of RNG are going to kill this game(might just be salty with this statement cause every time I try and craft thorn armor it’s nocturnal). Bethesda, just let people grind. If you told me that to reach level 100 in the SCORE system all I had to do was get 10,000,000 xp with dailies and weeklies supplying a small boost I would be more than happy with that cause missing a day isn’t the end of it.
---
Amen
---
Can you get the ghillie suit? I've gotten everything up to the NW beanie but already have the ghillie suit. My wife doesn't have it yet and it would be worth getting for her if it is in there. I've heard that it is and that ot isn't.
---
#You need to drop all of your notes and holotapes right now.
---
Too bad we can't drop keys...
---
I had this but it was a Mirelurk Queen trying to kill me hiding in a building a Scorchbeast flys over head and starts attacking it.
---
I poped a few shots at both and let them weaken each other till one won then killed the other was a good fight.
---
Yes! Exactly. I agree with this. But a guy at line in the sand told me not to use my Tesla because “it’s too hard for him to pick up the loot” like ???
---
Yeah this is why its bugged. In third person, the light seems to eminate from your shoulder and it points straight up, if you switch to first person it points in front of you and will move with you when you look around, but not in third person.
---
Looking forward to it making its way into the game too, just that last one to unlock!
---
Nah, I just find it interesting that within a few seconds of me posting the comment it was downvoted. Knowing how some people can be with people contradicting or disagreeing, I asked.
---
Crossbow with explosive mod, I like this one. Common weapons always is boring
---
Right. So a BP system is designed to provide you with some rewards. Instead of an all or nothing system.
---
It's not designed so even the most casual players can complete it. Like my self. I play 76 less than I used to. I'll maybe finish half the pass.... I'll get half the rewards.
---
Not according to the wiki, and not according to experience. Formula is Xp required for the next level is 160n+40, where n is the current level.
---
I'm gain for doing that but you'll just get toxic people ruining it
---
Yes!
---
Please fix this!!
---
Believe it or not bash dmg on a heavy spin up gun works pretty well for all those annoying af ankle biters.
---
Hot take: I like crusts. I know, I'm a monster.
---
Honestly I love it. Every season for pubg mobile I would pay the $25 for the season. That was worth it to me. This is free so I have no complaints. I always made it to a hundred in pubg Mobile a couple weeks before the season was over without ever having to pay anything additional. This I may not make it to a hundred but I'm happy to earn stuff.
---
Drop notes and holotapes right now.
---
The only Holotape you need is the Missile Silo State Holotape.
---
As someone who takes all 3 pylons every single time, they need to make the legendary reward automatic in the reward pool like they do Fasnacht. I get nothing but a white wolf fedora for my hundreds of stimpacks used.
---
Probably. You will get xp whether you try or not. 10K isn’t that much and every 10K gives you 100 score.
---
THANK YOU.
---
Regular Virginia made me lol.
---
In ESO all bodies close enough to each other pool their loot for you and they glow. Why isn't this a thing?
---
I get this then after than lock on to a scorched theough a boarded up window and hit it.
---
I haven’t gotten repeatable once, and it’s about to reset.
---
a minute to kill one of each? That seems a bit much. TBH I only die from either if I don't have Serendipity 3 equipped, but then again without that I pretty much die to anything. 
---
Regarding damage output, do you have any of the heavy gunner perks equipped? That should make killing the little buggers easier. You may also wanna switch to a heavy weapon with a smaller grouping like the LMG or miniguns; 2 shots have notoriously bad groupings and such only make sense when paired with explosive and with Demo perk maxed.
---
You can even carry a backup napalmer for trouble mobs. 
---
Personally the ones that really get to me are feral ghouls, since I'm bloodied. I carry the napalmer for those, and for the rest, my Junkies FFR UGL and Junkies minigun are more than enough.
---
lawl do kids share their stories about acting hard on fo76 subreddit?
---
Bethesda really doesn't understand the difference between making a game more challenging, and making it more tedious. It's especially bad now that they have the ulterior motive of selling "atoms".
---
Yeah. I don't get it. First off its not a two tier BP like others. We get full access for free. You get something for every level. Take the free route on other BPs? 
---
You get a reward every several levels.... 
---
Even a casual player can get a decent chunk of free stuff.... I don't get it. This attitude of "We all deserve everything free and easy" is beyond me.
---
I feel like there is such a strong tendency for everyone to just go BETHESDA BAD at the drop of a hat. Sure the ammo converter is a counterintuitive pain in the ass, but it can still generate (in my experience) about 1k rounds in about 8 hrs of gameplay if you pick up every round you see and someone posted that they wanted to punch whoever designed it in the face. For giving us something that required almost no effort to earn that could convert one resource into another (very very slowly).
---
A lot of people are complaining about "the grind" in regards to getting everything. The truth if it is that in simple gameplay if you hit up a few events a day and do your dailies you can easily get more than 20 treasury notes a day and more legendaries than you can handle in the course of about 2 hours. I've started actually playing with one of my 3 mule accounts because my main has over 400 treasury notes. 
---
Its very confusing to me when people complain about "grind".
---
If you aren't the type of player to take the time to try and play for an hour to gain at least some progress in the SCORE system this isnt for you. 
---
I'm rambling and kinda high. 
---
I enjoy this game and the amount of time it takes to complete the daily rewards for multiple characters is pretty short if you play smart.
---
Now _that_ is something I can agree with. You gotta kill the damned things before they get too close. If you're melee, hope you have Born Survivor 1 and Blocker 3 on, because if not you going down.
---
It happens at 9:00 am where I live, so I sleep just right past it lol
---
Were you in NW before hand?
---
I absolutely feel locations should at least have some changes each patch. Just small stuff. This month, someone finally takes over the old Abernathy place, and ghouls are swarming the Ash heap from some unknown source, taking over some of the Blood Eagle locations. Next month, the Raiders and Settlers pushed and cleared out the ghouls, but are now fighting, increasing raider vs settler encounters in the region. All it's take is minor changes to the setting of what spawns where.
---
Level 104 still useless
---
I had a fun game and came in first place with 1 other team mate and got 20 minutes then hid in a bush for the last 10, but you do you.
---
Yeah, was on getting the daily for Score. Does that trigger it?
---
You need high strength and decent armor for melee.
---
Healing factor mutation helps.  
---
I presume you have martial artist maxed out?
---
Consider fast 1H weapons Instead of slower 2H (or even medium speed 1H)
---
I picked up a vampire switchblade somewhere between L60 and 65.  Now 209, it is still my primary weapon.
---
That vampire switchblade will hit 3x in the time it takes a grognak to hit once.   
---
  Without foods, etc. it actually does more damage n the same time frame.
---
I also have a FSS ghoul slayer switchblade which will hit about 5x in the same timespan. It melts the mobs at WS (on average,no more than 3 hits to take out a L62 ghoul)
---
If you have Class Freak 2, twisted muscles mutation. (class freak will offset the Gun accuracy penalty from twisted muscles)
---
looks like an ok bloodied build to me.. 
---
ME.? I wouldnt run the day and night cards.. YMMV
---
Who is gonna walk up to you and just start spewing insults at you while you're walking around not bothering anyone? I think you're assuming that people are gonna act a certain way and expecting them to be shitheads without even finding it out for yourself. I've made a ton of great friends on this game and that never would've happened if I didnt take a chance and get on the mic.
---
Even if the rare bad apple DOES insult you in-game, no matter what they say they cant actually hurt you in real life. I hope you're aware of that.
---
I get terrible lag and stutters when my toon is hungry and thirsty.
---
It's the DR.
---
OP said they're using Two-Shot. That reduces the damage of each damage hit to 0.60, so the DR works harder.
---
The only ways to beat this are to crank your damage way up or get DR penetration, like you likely run.
---
Did you cheat in 2019 and they’re just now getting around to it?
---
Assaultrons are _hell_ if you're melee, but a little bit easier if you've got a decent heavy weapon. Gutsys though, if you don't have _all_ the damage mitigation perks then I hope you know how to take cover because those buggers will chew through HP in short order.
---
also.. Id run max blocker.. ignoring 45% of incoming melee damage is huge in this game...
---
Yeah - not always, though
---
Hahahaha
---
As many others have suggested with past events and how gold is used let us earn points and buy the rewards we want with it instead of tirelessly grinding for a bunch of shit we dont want.
---
lol.....I have since tried placing it according to the instructions but I still couldnt get it to work. However yesterday I attended my first Line of Sand where someone had placed theirs correctly and it was literally raining scorched. so I took note of exactly how and where they put theirs so hopefully next time I can replicate it with success
---
Its I'm there, I just got mine 2 days ago. If you're logged onto nuclear winter you can go to the challenges page and track your progress! By the time you get the ghillie suit, assuming you start with nothing, you'll have every event item except the winterjacket.
---
Nope. I don't cheat in online games
---
It's really not as bad as you all make it out to be.
---
Können die sogar?
---
I made a similar post to this, like in every other post had somebody start disagreeing right away by acting like a little kid, then got my post removed when only he kept at it. So.. At least some posts are still up I guess. I agree completely with you. There have been too many actions driving away casuals and semi casuals away which is not the right direction to go for a game like this which we all want to succeed. When diehards act the way they do in these situations and allow these people to be driven away, then all they are left with is other diehards, which is.. how many people total? Cater to your main audience. Know your audience. People who grind everyday aren't going to spend money on the seasons. Meanwhile the rest of us might last through this season, but what about the next one?
---
No I really don't get your point. The 76 dev team did almost the exact same thing with the legendary perk system just recently. Rather than release a shitty half asses system into the game that technically worked but was heavily criticized they decided to hold back on it to improve it. Are really you going to sit here cherry picking every fault in this game without giving them any credit when they do the thing you want them to do?
---
I'll concede that Bethesda the company is a lot more willing to put out a bugged product. Given the engine they use for this game it's inevitable that there will be bugs though. Saying the dev team doesn't have passion or love for their product is just ignorant. It's not their fault the company decided to build this game on an engine not made for multiplayer. You're confusing a teams lack of resources for apathy. You obviously don't want to accept the reality that with a smaller team working on outdated technology you will accomplish less.
---
If your argument had been Bethesda could learn how having more people working on your game and a better suited engine for your game will make for a better product then sure I would agree. But your whole premise seems to be based around the idea that both teams should be equally capable of reacting to player feedback and polishing their game when the reality of the dev teams very different situations means that simply isn't true. You aren't wrong that Bethesda the company could learn from how Capcom handles MH:W, but your criticisms of the dev team specifically do not hold water when comparing the vastly different working conditions.
---
I mean would you prefer the Fallout 4 alternative of extremely tanky mobs? There's a reason Survival Mode just tripled damage for both players and NPCs: because people were complaining that high-level mobs were "too bullet spongey".
---
I told my girlfriend not to install it.
---
I joined a random events group and did 2 events. The leader of the group dropped me a handmade plan and left the team.  I did a WTF and quickly picked it up.
---
If you're doing a stealth build you're better off using normal or legendary armour than power armour, I'd suggest aiming for 4 pieces of Vanguard (Up to +35 damage and energy resistance, the higher your health is) armour and 1 piece of Chameleon (Invisible while sneaking and not moving) but otherwise just use your best armour for now
---
For a sniper rifle, look for the Instigating effect (Double damage if target is full health)
---
Because Sniper rifles use the Rifleman Perk Cards (Perception) you can also easily switch between that and Commando (Automatic rifles)
---
I recommend at least keeping a Junkie's (+10% damage per addiction, up to 5) or Anti Armour (Ignores 50% of target's armour) Commando weapon for if you know there's a big boss coming, you'll get higher dps than the sniper rifle
---
_
---
There's also the option of Bloodied (Damage increases as health decreases) which requires a different armour set and weapons
---
For that aim for a Bloodied Sniper Rifle and Bloodied Commando rifle
---
Look for 4 or 5 Unyielding (up to +3to all stats except endurance, the lower your health) armour pieces, Chameleon is optional but personally for a Bloodied stealth sniper I do think one piece would be helpful
---
Are they bloodied and your health is changing?
---
You didn’t get 10K in an entire week?
---
Sleep for 5% well rested bonus. Do path to enlightenment. Join a team and use inspirational perk. Eat canned meat stew or a cranberry food. 
---
Watch the xp fly in
---
I don’t disagree, but these kind of things will always remain difficult and level of dedication is entirely subjective. I’m married with 2 children, 1 diabetic cat and a 60 hour a week job that all combined, make it increasingly difficult to allocate a ton of uninterrupted time into anything. Yet, the vast majority of the free-time I can patchwork together is absolutely dedicated to FO76. 
---
So in the scheme of my life, to say I’m not 100% dedicated to the game because I choose to give my family my undivided attention or get enough sleep to be effective on the job could be insulting. Now, I’m not insulted at all, but yeah, would feel a decent bit disappointed if I didn’t have a fair shake to achieve a lot of what the season has to offer. That may be a filthy casual take on it, but if I had more to give I’d certainly do it.
---
Play a LOT.
---
Apparently
---
Any other plans you want to buy? I have most of the Faschnacht plans too but not in the vendor yet for lack of room
---
I sell all the prime receivers in my vendors for 90 caps each.  I haven't counted how many they are.
---
If poison is your main fear, find at least two armor pieces with +25 poison resistance. You'll start seeing results with 1, but at 2 everything but the Mirelurk Queen and her kings will be nothing more than a minor nuisance. At 3 even those guys' poison will seem like harmless tickles, and then your fear will transfer to those goddamned flaming floaters. Seriously, Fireproof 3, ER 400, Dense mod, and those gasbags still chew through HP like it was nothing.
---
I run near 50 most of the time, and get more than 500 ... I want to say I see a lot of 576xp at west tek
---
Some people just suck ha ha I had someone on a public team with me today and I did the come over here emote for an event and only one showed up. Better than none I thought and started the event only to realise the guy was just spinning on the spot waiting for me to do the event and give him free xp and a legendary..... 😠
---
Isn’t adrenaline still not working? If so I’d go with tenderizer till they fix adrenaline. Also gun fo if you like using vats a lot.
---
Better weapons than pipe. Anything that is lvl5-15
---
Were you on Xbox? Had my first one last night and it sounds like an identical story
---
Yeah I just had to fill up 3 characters to get my mule un-laggy enough to be able to level him up and travel to some train stations to buy some plans, doing anything on him is unbearable. Full set of wwr, every single weight reduction perk in the game with every piece of armor modded to ultralight and he’s still around 1500/510 carry weight with 800 pounds in the box. I just made a separate mule account to help things out a little bit
---
Really? Because if I wanted to play Fortnite I’d play Fortnite.
---
Yeah, and I especially love giving new players loads of purified water and stimpacks and watch them become over-encumbered 
---
/s
---
PLEASE being back the succulents 😭
---
Yup. They fixed the spinning as well.
---
Here are some thoughts about it:
---
It's still week 1/10
---
They have planned double score and XP events
---
It's the first time the franchise did something online with a seasonal system similar to that of other current online games.
---
The challenges are broke.
---
My conclusion is despite the conspiracy theories that Bethesda hates us and wants our money via atoms, they'd much rather make a body of gamers happy at the end of it where we talk as good as possible about the game bringing more players to the ecosystem. More eyes means more money.
---
If by week 6 or 7 we don't see substantial progress in the board game, I'd agree being skeptical. And I do agree the current pace and issues are detrimental to our progress. But I believe for their own sake they'll make it accessible for more people if their numbers show players underachieving.
---
I agree with the pressure on things that are broken right now but I still have faith they'll give players avenues to succeed. If not you can post this in aged like milk subreddit and I'll take my beatings 😂
---
Get the blocker perk, never look back.
---
Shhhhh Todd might hear you! EVERYTHING JUST WORKS!!!! 😤
---
Tactleneck
---
Sheepsquatch can spawn as random encpinters?
---
Blocker plus ghouls slayer legendary armor turns them into a joke.
---
I lasted about 3 days. Ghosts of Tsushima and New World are a couple of weeks away so didn't even really start grinding knowing I'd be there instead. I'll keep an eye out for future stuff but done for now I think.
---
I'll add you when I get home tonight. I play almost everyday on a few different builds.
---
I think it’s the game glitching and considering your first shot’s chance only.  Notice the exact moment you activate it, vats says 0% chance?
---
Eyeroll
---
Thank you so much. I never would have looked for a sub-list.
---
What is a sticky
---
Like what
---
Pretending that FO1st is about the atoms you get with it is an original take.
---
See. I'm in the same boat. Work. Family. Other stuff. 
---
I don't play every day. Or sometimes even for a few days at a time I don't log in at all. 
---
I however am going to get a decent chunk of free atoms, cosmetics, and camp items for playing. I can't really see a reason to complain.
---
Give em a day or 2 to look at the code man
---
They're front line units so honestly them and assaultrons make sense. My only complaint with gutsies is the lack of opening between attacks to pound them.
---
The problem is the shit rewards. Skins for armor and guns I will never use no thanks. 50 legendary scrip no thanks. Better rewards would make it not so bad and worth doing
---
Doesn't excuse the anti consumer refusal to even talk to customers and auto lock tickets!
---
But how do I get the VTU stash box? 😭
---
Daily SCORE is the new gimmick, bois. Jump on in and start a new grind!  
---
Me, I'm still putting around at level 46 enjoying my game :)
---
I ran into a bush then went to get my dinner , gr8 game i r8 5/7 - but now i'm part of the problem as Bethedsa can go "look how many idiots are playing this POS, guess we will keep pushing it"
---
I've done everything so far and had the repeatable loads of times... And I don't think I'm at level 20 yet... Hmmm
---
Well, that guy is wrong!
---
inspirational yes. strange in numbers no
---
Herd mentality yes. 
---
 [Not in a team](https://imgur.com/FG6GVY2)
---
[And in a team by myself](https://imgur.com/xKAioNc)
---
I dont understand this at all. I have a not particularly optimized stealth sniper build and I have zero problems with gutsy.
---
Assaultrons on the other hand...
---
If it's a legendary assaultron I'll die. At least once.
---
edit: reposted under the actual comment...
---
Agreed, I run a full health rifle build so I try to grab all 3 as well, or at least 2/3.  Then hide and if.. if it's safe take a few shots at the robot.   I wish they would make all events reward like the parade, too 😐.   I did get the fixer plans once though, so overall I'm still happy to be a conduit whenever someone starts it 😂
---
I'm looking forward to being able to play without having to put the disc I'm tbh, I'm very lazy
---
What were the lightbulbs?
---
Right on, I see exactly where you are coming from. It’s people who have the opportunity, but don’t want to put in the effort that do tend to complain the loudest to the point of devaluing the whole deal. Absolutely should be uncommon for someone to break through the top tier.
---
I agree, gold is better as you can focus on the stuff you really want instead of grinding 70+ levels of totally uninteresting stuff to get the dark matter combat rifle skin - something I will most likely give up on. with the gold system you could at least pick what you want, the only gripe I got there is the damn timegate. I cant play every day, but some days I might be able to play for 2 or even 4 hours but it really hurts my progress with all the daily limits - i e I cant "catch up".
---
I was!
---
My junkies ffr automatic gamma gun does wonders in pvp. Everyone forgets about radiation damage. Quick Hands also goes off consistently making it even more devastating. Use VATS with it and it’s a great surprise weapon.
---
Hit 20 today, but need to finish up 1 more daily. Think I can grind the repeatable weekly to close out at 21 by tonight.
---
I’m on Xbox and it’s exactly the same for me.
---
Gamepass?
---
STOP! I can only get so hard!!
---
thought it was just me
---
You do realize they are free right? You don't NEED to get to lvl 100 (even though you CAN for free). They are just cosmetics
---
You're a good father and you have taught him well! ♥️
---
Strange in Numbers only applies when others in your team are also mutated.
---
Believe it or not, I've joined a couple of public teams with that perk equipped, and to my surprise none of the other 3 players had mutations. And so I got no benefit.
---
Ammosmith 2 and Super Duper maxed really helps Me stay over 1k in gamma rounds just for pvp.
---
Show the how to take a workshop and encourage more pvp! 😁
---
You don't have to replace the whole wall, it's a wallpaper. When you're looking at one of your walls with the edit on, you'll see on top of the screen you have the option of "wallpapers". You go there, and select the one you bought.
---
Just do Back on the Beat, because whilst it's a pretty tedious event there are loads of loe level ghouls and also a possibility of the Forest Camo Jumpsuit dropping (rare)
---
This sub seems to run super hot or super cold. The dogpile on the ammo converter was hilarious. If the season could be knocked out quickly and everyone got all the rewards, there would be many complaints about that too. I’m not a fan of seasons, but I made it to level 18 today and I’ve been very casual about it. Join building teams, run some daily quests, jump into events, do some food or camp building if asked, and earn some rewards. That’s the entirety of the science I am putting into it. I have no clue how far up the ladder I will get, but if I can’t find any joy in the journey, then the rewards aren’t worth my time to begin with.
---
Do you remember a guy in nukashine x01 and another in excavator?
---
Sorry I didn’t see you meant pure unarmed.
---
Cooked meat only works about half the time, but making mutfruit juice works.  :)
---
Completely agree, it's like with the Fasnacht masks or, and I understand the rng was awful, the mole miner pails
---
The whole point of rare items is that they're rare, if everyone got them they wouldn't be
---
It's fun having extra rewards to earn through playing but I fully understand that I won't get everything on that board
---
So this whole time you're arguing with me because I'm "criticizing the dev team specifically". I said Bethesda, as in Bethesda as a whole. I never said anything  about the dev team specifically. Stop reading things into what I said. Read what I said. Bethesda needs to learn from the monster  hunter team. That's what I said, that's what I meant. Not my fault if you assume to know what I'm talking about. 
---
Can't believe I wasted half a day on you and once again you're not even replying to my actual point.
---
I was in excavator armor with the red shift paint, I was too immersed in the battle to notice really but I saw someone wearing either raider armor or a raider-style skin for the x01 I think
---
Don't forget stims. New players lap those up.
---
no. You can have one brahmin through the fertilizer collector, one robot, one human companion and one animal/creature pet.
---
The world seems to be loading in way slower now too. Run a bit too far and say goodbye to half the world
---
Ahhh, not sure then, did one just hop out of the power armor to just start punching its knees?
---
No.  You're right.  He wants the 1st skins to be rereleased for 1st members.  Only so he can sub for a month and cancel it after he gets the skins.  Until about 4 months ago, I had no idea that they phased the 1st content out, since i sub and it always shows once you have it.  He knew what content would eventually come out, decided he didn't like how Bethesda was handling things (which I don't disagree with), and cancelled his 1st sub.  The riot armor was teased in the atom shop, and was data mined to show that it was in the game.  And since the NCR armor was already a 1st item, at release, it would stand to reason that the riot variant would be an additional skin "at some point".  Now, seeing how they handle items coming and going in the atom shop, as well as 1st, all you have to do is look at the FO76 page to see what's coming out this month.  That's all OP had to do.  OP wants ALL of the 1st items to come back, so that he/she/apachehelicopter can snag them all at once.  Yeah, that'd be awesome.  But, it would also be shitting on all of the 1st members who understood these items to be "exclusive", to "current" subscribers.    1st members didn't get the discounts on items, like we were told we would. We didn't get "private" servers, like they said we would.  So, the skins that were supposed to be "exclusive" to 1st members, should be exactly that.  I mean, come on.  1st has only been available for what, not even a year yet?  Give it some time before you ask Bethesda to dump on us, at least.  
---
The shitty tactic that Bethesda used was to get you subbed, not give you ALL the cool shit at once, to keep you subbed.  That's how these things work.  They also didn't tell us that the items would be time locked.  That was a shitty deal. But, the way they work it is, you have to stay subbed to get it all. Now, maybe when 1st hits a year, they'll reneg on this and make everything available again.  But, honestly, I don't see that happening.  At most, they'll sell the 3 NCR armors separately, for, probably 800-1200 atoms a piece, and then the skins for whatever they normally sell skins for.  I can at least see that happening after 1st has been out for at least a year. But, they should sell them at a discounted price for people that missed it the first time.  
---
At least they let you keep the skins when you cancel.
---
Dense torso mod.
---
I had forgotten about it until recently and .. ya now I stand on cars and blow them up when my feet feel cold.
---
That's the spirit, mate
---
It's 250 points, you'd be fine without it. Suck it up or don't play NW.
---
Hey man, I'm level 60 and I've been searching for BOS combat armor for as long as I can remember... Could I buy those from you by any chance?
---
The game takes place in West Virginia, and West Virginia is super white. According to the 2010 Census data, 93.2% non-Hispanic white. 
---
Previous games had more ethnic diversity–New Vegas had many Hispanic NPCs, and Fallout 3 had quite a few African-American NPCs–which reflects the demographics of those areas. 
---
Migration would play a part in shaking up the demographics of post-war Appalachia, but most of those migrants seem to be coming from Pennsylvania ("Up North", or "The Pitt") which is also a relatively white state (81.9%). 
---
While there can be issues of representation in video games, it seems that in the context of Fallout 76, the heavily white demographics are accurate to the source material. I'm not a fan of when East Asian fantasy settings are populated by Caucasians, and likewise, I don't see why one of the whitest states in America should suddenly become ethnically diverse due to nuclear war.
---
I have to constantly pop stimpacks just to do two pylons. I can’t imagine running all 3.
---
I’m a bloodied build and I’ll pop a bunch or radaway to get enough life to do it.
---
I don't remember, I do remember there being like 2 dead scorchbeasts on the ground and we were next to the like bottom half of a house
---
Or you could just do West Tek once and get about the same amount of loot. Uranium Fever is about the legendaries, you can get normal Assault Rifles pretty much everwhere, no need to do an event for that.
---
Also pretty much any weapon one-shots Mole Miners.
---
I believe it is referring to the caps sharing effect when a teammate completes quest, but I have not tested it beyond knowing friends with less Charisma seem to get less.
---
Niiice
---
Yes. It's glorious. So does Herd Mentality.
---
I was all excited about this at the begin than I did the math and never bothered login again
---
Your sons gonna grow up to be a great man
---
You can tank the pylons by just hotkeying a food item.  Scorchbeast steaks are very effective, they give 200 hp or so over a long time.  Stimpacks wear out too fast.
---
Does this mean if I transfer items in a container and switch character to take the items there's the potential to loose the items?
---
I was level 81, my pfp was the flyboy one
---
Absolutely not. Bullet sponges and one-shot attacks are the laziest ways to add difficulty. They need enemies with more interesting mechanics.
---
For example the Flatwoods Monster has this mind control effect that doesn't seem to do anything but make enemies glow purple. Why not change it so it gives all those enemies increased damage reduction or extra power. This would make them way more dangerous and interesting. You could have an enemy that is only vulnerable to melee and headshots, or another that inflicts you with a debuff that reduces your healing output. There are lots of even more creative ways to make enemies challenging, it would just be a lot harder to implement some of them with how shitty this games engine is lol.
---
Could be a few things. If you unequip a weapon it will display it's unperked damage then with perk bonus when you equip. Also various legendary effects and mutations will alter the damage.
---
Reading this makes me want to take mine off my wall and give it a shot! (Pun totally intended)
---
I've been playing a lot, hit all the challenges with a good few repeatables, still not at 20... I think most people are gonna need to spend their few reward atoms to finish the season. =/
---
Encryptid is thee worst for this crap
---
Because this is an outlier for Bethesda games. Its online and theyre employing common online/mmo mechanics that have never been in Fallout.
---
So tons of people who aren't fans of MMO's or the like, but love Fallout, are used to being able to do and get everything. 
---
Also there's plenty of people who just want to be able to press the 'A' button and get what they want.
---
Also i feel like social media has really created this atmosphere of "FOMO" among people, fear of missing out. My wife is 7 years younger than me, so when MySpace was a big thing when i was in high school, she was a kid, same for FB, etc. People see things that look fun or cool and can't stand not being able to do it too.
---
Growing up with games and then seeing online games and they way they do things like this, and being an adult when online games started to explode.. i never really cared. Oh, so some people get stuff I don't,  whatever. I just play to have fun.
---
But a lot of people don't. They play to win. They play to get everything. They can't stand literally not having everything they want. 
---
Thats why so many people say the stash limit is dumb, because theyre hoarding one of every outfit and weapon even if they'll never use it. They just want to have it. Theyre virtual hoarders.
---
I like the season system in the game. First day it took me a few hours to complete all the weekly and daily challenges. Now it's been about 30 minutes to an hour a day to complete the dailies.  I've also gotten the repeatable XP challenge at least a dozen times just playing. 
---
There's a whole host of reasons why people are upset about it.. but it all boils down to the fact that they want everything and are just upset they can't have it no matter what.
---
Yup I just bought it again a few moments ago, I’ll most definitely give it another go. Just a quick question, what’s the best way to level my smithing? I hate to buy my own gear and prefer to be self sufficient in that regard.
---
Awesome! Made it a whole lot cooler. Thanks!
---
Damn xbox is a different story then I guess
---
I opened a ticket after they sent me the troubleshooting list on Twitter. I doubt it will result in anything. I also included the error code I get at least once a day for the last week, where the game just quits.
---
I think we will have enough for 10 levels
---
I joined one today on an alt. Must have been 10 people there. There were two people activating the pylons. Some level 250+ and me.. a level 13. I died so many times.
---
My friend and I combined our tickets and got the fancy shotgun twice.
---
I know but I don't carry that quantity of foods. I just join in the event when it pops up.
---

Nobody expects it handed to them. Implying that completely ignores the poor design of the mechanic. You are right though we are more casual because since F3 this is a casual RPG thats part of its appeal to players and a part of why 3d fallout has been successful.
---
 You cant compare WoW,LoL,ev or those kinds of rpgs to this crowd but there is also the reality that all those casual fallout players have close to or over 1000 hours played. Nobodys afraid to work for something in this game its when your margin of failure is near 0 people dont want to play. Thats not fun or by any means casual, a game that puts such a strict time requirement and low chance of a great prize with the RNG is psychologically not fun. Its not even skill based so you arent even getting better its just mindless busy work disguised as something new and 18 months later the challenges are still broke. 
---
The whole trying to make players seem entitled cause they don't like the grind is straight lazy internet arguing 101. Games are supposed to be a fun break from life not feel like a part time job where you have to strictly do tasks for the day for pay. Not to mention theres already people cheating the system who will face 0 punishment for doing it because theres never been any in the past plus you can buy your way to the top, so its not entitlement its more a demoralizing experience that makes people feel excluded from a game and community they enjoy but arent able to devote half their life too and it gets chalked up to being lazy,bad or entitled.
---
I did it quite successfully with my main till almost lvl 70 and respected to Junkies Commando just for way more damage potential. I was VATS/ Guerilla and blew everyone's head off with a QE 10mm pistol I scored from the Purveyor
---
Nukashine, survival of the fittest. Just kidding lol but throw any low level armor you pick up off random mobs into the vendors for cheap.
---
Exactly! I was lucky enough just once to have a teammate get the briefcase, and was so excited to have 2 codes to throw in! It’s awesome not being on the receiving end of a nuke for once!
---
All you typed out is literally nitpicking. ***WAHHHH I DON'T LIKE FREE STUFF WAHHHHHHH***
---
Alternatively if you need a shovel, there's 1 in the Flatwoods graveyard beside the church. There's also a shovel inside blackwater mine, near the first Uranium Extractor by a piece of machinery in the centre of the room.
---
Xp farming isn't a good gaming experience. It's a false responsibility trap. It's ptw psychology. Don't participate, don't be satisfied with xp farming as a pastime. You're worth more.
---
Might have been us but I'd, would be cool af if it was
---
My shit lags too much to run the pylons, iv tried. But counter argument, who cares about the legendary drop? I get more annoyed of the event failing bc players arnt damaging the ISS. Im not gonna throw on troubleshooters and do no dmg and risk nobody else doing any either when i kno can 1 shot it in the 3 secs it becomes vulnerable. Completes the event, everyone gets a shot at the REAL rewards. But if u want scrip so bad go do radiation or somethin, bc if im doin encrytpid im gonna finish it as quickly as i can.
---
FOMO is the entire function and purpose to the season.
---
Follow up question, If you're running Class Freak do you not suffer any special loss from Herd Mentality when not in a team? your strength went from 14 to 17, I would've expected 13 to 17?
---
Sadly I believe we will have a surge of toxic people coming into the game. But Im excited for the community to grow more and hopefully wash the toxic ones away
---
It would've been. Do you remember a mrfuntimes930 at all?
---
Camera is great for finding lost corpses, if you look through the viewfinder a list of everything that is within the frame will appear on top right.  Really helps narrow down the area.  BUT WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO DO THIS BETHESDA!!!  They had a "detect dead" in Skyrim for fuck sake.
---
yep i stay under nerd rage even in that event and use super stimpacks or nuka quantum but it s just when you see 10 people lvl 200-300 just sitting here doing nothing just waiting it s annoying.
---
I can solo it very easily and i just launch the event on public servers so everyone can have fun but there is a point where everyone have to contribute to succed the event, it s exactly the same issue with rad rumble nobody goes grab the ore and they just wait here until the event fail.
---
I think bethesda should do an xp multiplier related to how many pilons you activate or how many ores you grab
---
Cough mirelurk king
---
Yea anything like that would be good. Even if it's temporary things like helping restock the enclave robotic supplies for a week and for the next two weeks there's enclave robot patrols going around certain areas. Maybe make it a small event to help them attract a location. If we had say 20 things like that in a cycle it'd probably feel fresh for a while.
---
If you gained 0 xp and did all the weekly and daily challenges you’d be good. I think it’s fairly easy for active players, idk why people are crying we’re about 4 days in. Everything will be fine
---
I solo'd one that spawned in the Sundew Grove before patch 20, kinda cheesed it since it couldn't move out of there and there was plenty of cover around I could duck behind to dodge its ranged attack.  B25 Primed UGL FTMFW
---
Ah no, sorry, we had something coconut???? And a Forbes something or other
---
Any time I emote everyone to that spot In front of V9 I either get sarcastic emotes back or they just keep shooting at her in the air. It gets annoying but whatever. We're all in this together.
---
how those people are not ashamed letting a lvl 13 activate the pilons^^
---
That's likely intentional
---
Its still ups and downs, but thats how it is...lost my biggest love till now last year, and  due to covid-19 situation its about sure i loose my Job at 1.10.20...life goes on.
---
Thanks! Im proud i made it that far, and since im over the past, i really enjoy life, maybe even a bit more than others:)
---
Try using "sResourceIndexFileList=BetterInventory.ba2, PerkLoadoutManager.ba2" (without the quotes, of course)
---
Finally someone with the guts to say the hard truth.
---
I think it was a bug in the patch 19 update.
---
I had a few challenges reappear: mistaken identity was one of em.
---
They fixed a bunch and changed older ones that definitely affected veteran players with wastelanders
---
Ah, then probably not. That would've been crazy tho
---
Probably more about getting loot to scrap for steel.
---
But the guy ain’t no motivational leader that’s for sure
---
I hit 18 by doing all the non-NW dailies. Hit the "gain 10000 xp" a few times as well.
---
This event is why i keep super stimpacks from those sbq events. I was able to activate two pylons while the robot chased me aroind and stay alive. 🙂
---
As a bloodied rifle build you already are likely 15 per, plus another 15 per if you are using full unyielding.  Therefore 33 vats hit chance shouldn’t do much since you in theory are already high on vats accuracy.  Damage is damage so I think most would lean for damage though I’m also curious to hear other views.
---
Oh nice, I couldn't even attempt
---
So crazy lol
---
with class freak 3 i get no negative effects from not being in a team. Some people have had -1. It's to do with losing half points and them adding up eventually. See how my INT went up 4? half points adding up i reckon.
---
I think the building group and role player is best way to go. Once bonded, you increased xp even if you arnt in any events.... good times
---
This is my complaint. I can't play everyday but I can play along time some days.
---
people keep saying to do this, but the paper bag thats its in when dropped will either disappear after a time, or not register an item inside of it.
---
its a nice thought, but functionally it has a very small chance of helping someone. unless someone will do the quest after you within 15 minutes, the gesture is pointless. 
---
also the shovel does NOT have a 100% to spawn, meaning if it isnt there, it doesnt automatically mean someone took it.
---
It will always be a bugged game
---
Okay cool. I'll happily take another 80 atoms regardless of how it happened. Just nice to know I'm not the only one.  Thanks.
---
I think a lot of the expectation comes from the big buildup for seasons and new content.... and then the actual new content all being delayed. 
---
There is a natural sense of entitlement to be involved in this legendary run because it’s literally the only thing going on for longer term players, and that long term play in the past doesn’t guarantee any of them anything at all from this update. 
---
I played the online game World of Tanks for a long time and the grinds and marathons there make this look like child’s play. But there was and is a lot going on besides. 
---
This game made a big noise about these seasons and we all rightfully and predictably got excited for it and built it up in our own way, even individually, what it would mean to us and our enjoyment with the same old stuff getting stale. 
---
And now this is the only thing thing to do and people aren’t liking the fact it’s been time and effort gated to only the most dedicated or in this games case exploiters.
---
The sense of unfairness and letdown and expectation was always going to cause unhappiness, and now even the people who are grinding it well are frustrated because of the bugs that are affecting the event SCORE gain. 
---
But yes essentially as a tldr, people are frustrated and confused that the only real “new content” in this patch (I use that term loosely) is not for everyone and is not accessible for all for free or at their own pace/playstyle.
---
I agree with you though and have said as much in other threads. This is absolutely not made for everyone to get to the end and people shouldn’t expect to. That’s not how grinds work, but anywhere you get playing normally is a bonus regardless of how good or bad you think those rewards are.
---
It’s just a shame it has happened with nothing new alongside it that everyone can enjoy and get on with, so there’s a lot of puzzlement and resentment about it and what the average or more casual player should be doing or is getting.
---
Oh thank god you are a lifesaver.
---
Those are easily obtainable from using treasure maps, some are more rare drops from the pool.
---
Here’s a handy [list](http://dulfy.net/2018/12/02/fallout-76-treasure-maps-guide/) with all the locations marked for convenience!
---
I love this.   What a great kid and great dad!
---
Ooof... I can’t stand those bitches either lol
---
Its locked afaik i think rhey bring some back but im notsure
---
Happens to me all the time
---
I sell serums for 250 caps dude... (XB1 CAPTALN APOLLO, shameless plug lol)
---
I play a lot anyway so I'm gonna see how far I get but tbh some of the rewards suck. I want that fireplace tho and that's right at the end.... -_- I think I prefer the old atom rewards and getting to choose what I want. They should have just made this a 1st thing on top of the old atom challenges. (maybe reduce the grind if it was a 1st thing)
---
Yup. :( It's why I stopped playing after a while.
---
Switching 3 cards just to craft stuff was like redoing my entire build. I know "loadouts" can be saved on PC with an outside source but on Console we're stuck with the shitty system.
---
Yes, but Uranium is a co-op event that's "intended" to be done by a group of people. 
---
It's a matter of consideration. Yes, I know I can go to west tek and do a solo pass, but if that location was an event where other people are there, I'm gonna make sure my fun isn't at the expense of another and downgrade my weaponry.
---
Yes, a bloodied explosive blah blah blah will one shot a miner, but that's my point. Don't use your god roll insta-killer in that event and you won't be treading in asshole territory.
---
People still pay upwards of 7k for them. They never last more than 30 minutes in my vending machine
---
No way to get them atm.
---
Yes, but it'll bug the event. There was a thread a few a week or so ago about it.
---
it's an alternative history so the 2010 census data is hardly germane as migration patterns, etc., could have differed greatly when the timelines split. or to put it another way, the 2010 census data probably has very few (seemingly) self aware robots due to historical circumstances. not trying to call you out specifically, but just saying a speculative world always has some wiggle room in matters like this if the devs so choose.
---
I switch up my build from a bloodied to a 2/3rds health build with Troubleshooters armor for this. I grab all the pylons because I love laying into the Squatch with my Vampire Gatling. She tries so hard to kill me.
---
IV just done 2 weekly task and didn't get the s.c.o.r.e for it so if they do another season one that works might be nice
---
I showed up to an event as the only other one in a public team the other day, ended up having to run around the place picking up ammo as I had run out shortly after arriving. Im sure he thought the same thing, I wasnt prepared and just threw on my PA and jumped as i saw his health dropping and doing the come here emote.
---
Yeah youre right, fallout really shows that. But every playing kiddy gets told that its just a game, not to be mistaken with reality.
---
I was talking bout teaching him in/for reality.
---
it s quite easy to activate 1 pilon and pop a stimpak when needed , except maybe if you have 10sec input lag which im sure you don t.  And alot of players can solo the ISS, but it s not the point of it when you do it on public servers. 
---
btw i don t care about the scrips at rad rumble but when i grab 40 ores it s not enough to finish the event. usually now i grab the ores and wait to see if someone else is doing it too, if not, i dont place them in the yellow thing so the event fail.
---
I’ve been learning the art of bush wooking and I’ve seen some funny shit lately.
---
In one of the earlier patches the devs made a point of mentioning they fixed a light no one knew or cared was broken.  It did not go well for them on social media as this was at a time when there were some serious game breaking bugs that were still present from launch.
---
There aren't any energy weapon perks. There is a energy ammo perk, but that doesn't apply because it's the plasma frame is a mod, not ammunition.
---
Not only that but the main “prize” in my opinion was the ammo converter, which even without reading the challenges and just playing an hour or 2 a day, you could get to it in about a week or 2.
---
Mostly everything else is either cosmetic or just XP boosts and Crafting Mats
---
yes same it s my super stimpak sink^^
---
I built up a room in my C.A.M.P. just for the fireplace. Can’t stop now!
---
:) Moin...was meinst du, was können die? Und wer ist die? Versteh leider nicht die Frage...
---
Reset is at 12PM EST. So if you’re on the west coast, login AFTER 9:05 and you’ll be fine.
---
Also don’t play NW BEFORE you login to adventure.
---
No need for appearance tho
---
Our own little zoos of oddities.
---
It's so disappointing. I'm playing more now. But in the future I won't.
---
yeah yeah we get it, you're hard-core, you're happy to slave away your life to a game and should get the perks we filthy casuals get to fawn over, meanwhile i bought the tft battlepass for league of legends, did not play the game for a month (you know, shit to do, other games are a thing) and still finished with time to spare without having to glue myself to my pc every day, thing is, i would REALY like that secret door, since base building is my jam in this game, convoluted grinding less so, and i don't mind working for it, i do mind that my choices are either make the time to log in every single day for a couple of hours (which i can't because i'm 35 and got shit going on) or min max and semi abuse event hopping (which is not why i play the game).
---
I might join you in your good deed brigade, im lv 65 i think
---
Do you wish it didn't have that mini deer head on it? I do xD
---
Yeah it’s hard to believe something you pay for either monthly or a yearly membership and you can’t have access to COSMETIC items from previously or I dunno at least give the plays and the community guidance or add a patch notes to explain what will be available each and every month.... I was just just curious... I played the game at beta hell I even got my power armour edition played it day one and it was a buggy empty mess... recently got back into it due to the wastelanders DLC so much that I’m almost at level 100 (I know it’s nothing special considering I’ve seen big boy levels of 400+) but I thought hell I’ve been playing the game and even enjoying it maybe the fallout 1st is a good thing to buy... I like the other benefits but the added bonus of getting my fav armour from NV... ah well... appreciate the reply and the time to help a brother out ❤️
---
We have achieved bugception. I'm glad to have an explanation why that keeps happening with my gauss shotgun though. Strangely I've never had it with my combat shotgun...
---
Honestly, I don’t remember how it looks. Just that it’s a real fireplace (not the electro one, which I have) and I can hide my dirty magazines behind jt
---
Activating the pilons is like the one thing I do in that event.  I'm level 108 and still feel so completely underpowered during the event, dying repeatedly.  I figure I can at least do that job to earn my treasury notes.  But that event is a confusing war zone to me.....
---
Reduced weight shovels should NEVER be scripped.
---
Awesome, how would I go about finding you in the game world?
---
I skipped one day will I miss out?
---
It's so cool to be able to bond over a shared experience in the Fallout world. Is there a way to censor the swearing for the little ones?
---
Sounds like you were trying tho, this guy was literally stood in one spot spinning until the event ended...
---
There are quite a few people who wish it wasn't multiplayer. It's why Bethesda charges a premium for private servers.
---
Being right without being a condescending dick IS a thing, if that alleviates your confusion as to the downvotes
---
If you mean 'Bush Simulator 2020', then yeah.
---
I totally get that. First thing I do in rumble is grab 25 ore. I have my own upgraded and modded crook for herding Brahmin so I can herd and attack. 
---
I think there definitely needs to be some kind of experience gained for doing the tasks that keep you from killing mobs. I’d even include collecting bioluminescent bits for Path to Enlightenment. That would almost make it a game to see who could earn the most.
---
I feel like indoor events like Uranium, Paradise, and Rumble need to allow everyone in the event to loot all bodies. I know a lot of people are worried about afkers but it gets  tiresome doing all the extra tasks guaranteeing the event is a success to get the lowest possible rewards. I’d rather have a couple afkers getting less rewards for not participating than to run all the tasks myself and not get very much loot.
---
I sold one for 15k a few weeks back
---
if i can advise you something, get a shot at the sheepsquach even if it s invisible just in case some dumb guy one shot it while you are near the pilon activating it. soon i ll be 400 and still need some concentration to do that event
---
Hang on I’ve logged out for the night now, shoot me a DM with your ign and I’ll add to friends list and we can meet up after I log back in
---
Yea it looks really good, just has a small mounted deer head on it tho kinda looks odd but I'll still be using it... If I get it that is
---
Is it just the antlers?
---
It can be pretty entertaining when it gets down to the smaller circles
---
I have never played NW but this makes me want to try it.  As long as no one expects great things from me.....
---
Didn’t mean to hijack your thread.
---
There have been a number of encryptids I've shown up to on my bloodied pipegun build where it's quickly obvious I need to clear some rads and spam super stimpacks because no one else is interested in holding a pylon
---
you know that the two biggest factions in Appalachia are lead by black NPCs right? not only are they present, they are in leadership rolls.
---
there have been a quite diverse range of characters in the games, and not even just on a racial or orientation axis, but on the species level too, with mutants, ghouls, and synthetics.
---
fallout has some problems, but diverse inclusion isnt one of them. this game actual manages to tackle racial or political issues without being overtly pandering or relying on tokenism like many others.
---
if the amount of POC generic NPCs is a problem for you, then i dont think you are really thinking about the issue in any meaningful way.
---
I lag so bad i can take 3-4 swings b4 it even registers my hits. I play on an original ps4. Its hot garbage. Cant even pop a single stim in time to save myself. So ya, imma stay in sneak and continue to let yall get the pylons, and that upsetting u isnt gonna make me play different. But if ur so good u can grab all the pylons and solo her idk what ur complainin about, just keep bein a chad and winning at life ig.
---
This,  tried to cute one too many times with my bloodied.  Now I typically try and stand back and get in a few shots with my crap guns while I let commandos do the heavy lifting
---
I really need that bundle
---
Personally I find NW to be painfully boring and slow so I avoid it. I don’t hide in bushes, I do try but I hate it
---
No sense to play like this for rewards.
---
Are you saying that because you've just given up hoping, or has Bethesda come out and said it yet?  I actually would believe either of those things....
---
You should try it. It can be very fun and a nice change of pace from the gring
---
I've been full health since launch and always been tanking 2 to 3 pylons. I've recently switch to bloodied after getting a nice handmade from momma murma and I'll use carnivore, heaps of scorchedbeast meat and stims so I'll still take a pylon in nerd rage. With 8 or 9 people in the event and typically 7 of them never touching a pylon it does get a little frustrating that people rarely share the burdon. Once you've gotten your hits then death isn't a concern so grab a pylon and let the previous pylon taker a chance to get some hits. But like others have said I'll judge whether I start it based on how a queen fight goes.
---
Only perk is the grounded mutation, and it's a negative effect any way!
---
Recently ran it three times with good luck, but I waited till around the 5-6 min mark to initiate the recall and people came knocking in.
---
Of course everyone was dying all around due to that damn robots hit stream of death!
---
Definitely the price of the card needs to be dropped because 2k caps is hard when you’re just starting to understand how to vend shit right.
---
A non-legendary Lever Action can one-shot a Mole Miner.
---
This is caused by the existence of player venders and display cases, before those existed this did not happen, even back when I had a glitched over weight stash box! It's the laggy ass scripting that causes everyone's stash box to be perpetually loaded into the server at once.
---
I still have mine and was lucky enough to get a level 50 3*
---
Any time I see someone selling AB ammo I buy it so fast.
---
I wanna go cosplay as a spaceman.
---
Yes!!!! I want to restart the order SO BAD!
---
So don't use a non-legendary lever action?
---
I think I've been to your camp!
---
Never, it's always be broken in future
---
I wish I could see it!  So many explosions, so much dying.... it freaks me out.  But thanks for the tip - I'll try.
---
i completely agree with you, all the people like you or me who are actively working to complete events should all group up on servers and let all those afkers and passive people on their servers failing events after events.
---
I m not completely sure about the solution but it s definitely something bethesda should look into (after solving the fast travel bug haha)
---
I did it solo with power armor, a 50 cal, and a few hundred stims at about lvl 60 but it seems as though our builds were probably much different
---
That's what she said
---
you ll see it glowing in green when it spawns :) good luck out there!
---
No fuck they are gonna ruin it
---
If no one activates pylons then the event fails. Im a full health player and I take a pylon every time. Sometimes Im stuck with all 3. For my "contribution" more often than not all I get out of it is whatever loot drops for the event completion because I cant tank pylons and take combat damage so I have to stay out of the fight and hide like a little bitch. And honestly I dont care. I like to "do my bit". But keep in mind while y'all are harvesting xp in that event, there is more than likely someone sacrificing their slice of the XP pie so you can eat yours.
---
You’re not paranoid at all, its most definitely horrible behavior!
---
Please tell me your magical secret!
---
ok
---
Wait you can mount animals now? That’s a thing? ( sorry haven’t played in a hot minute )
---
haha no worries
---
Some people just want to see the world burn lol
---
Always welcome!
---
Both Meg and Paige are black, Paladin Rahmani who will lead the new brotherhood will also be POC. I think 76 is the only fallout game in recent years where a majority of the leaders are women, POC or both.
---
What platform are you? I’d help you out if you are on XB1. As for solo, melee is tough depending on your level, build and gear. Hard to reach laser turrets with melee. There should be guides on YouTube I’d look into...
---
That time I soloed a Mirelurk Queen with nothing but a combat knife...
---
Wait, I forgot to mention that it was a Vampire's combat knife with a 40% bonus for power attacks.  
---
I was on one of the narrow roads in the Savage Divide and figured if I just kept running circles around it I wouldn't be hit with the poison and the knife is fast enough to keep me healed.
---
It took 10-15 minutes and I'm sure the knife must have been almost broken but I killed the beast with nothing but a knife.  Stab, circle, circle, stab, circle, circle, stab, etc.  The circling actually let me regen my AP so I could keep doing power attacks.
---
I still have that knife, maybe it's time I rename it, "The Queenslayer".
---
Alright, I saw a post from like a year ago that said it was possible but the picture almost seemed edited and they didn't answer anyones questions so that's why I asked
---
i received a fixer plan yesterday from encryptid and will sell it for less than 500 (my vending price ceiling), probably substantially less. not everyone selling stuff cheap shares your worldview in terms of a commodity's value. since i can't have a public potlatch of god roll rng items that i personally find no use for, i prefer to pass them along to someone who'll use them. why would i ever need/want 10,000 caps?
---
same
---
So today’s daily’s are lost?
---
random layouts with different objectives every time would be cool.
---
I've done three and they're so painfully dull
---
There will probably be spike in Xbox players once it hits game pass July 9th
---
Raises hand.
---
Although to be fair, I wouldn't bother if it wasn't for the current (assumed) glitch that's rewarding Christmas and Halloween items too, otherwise i'd just grind XP in adventure.
---
My favorite encounter so far is finding another bush wookie, and exchanging a wave for a thumbs up emote, and then going our separate ways :-)
---
It's a serious circlejerk down in these comments.
---
To be fair. A majority of the human NPCs in the game are not from West Virginia. Every one who was has died.
---
Just dont
---
What is it like being a tool
---
Wall mounts.
---
Your a tool
---
there are certain perks that will allow you to pick locks to bypass areas and hack computers to turn the turrets off or against your foes.
---
then I would recommend being outfitted with Troubleshooters armor and weapons. It's much easier with that.
---
20. Been doing all dailies and weeklies so far (Except that one NW daily to use stimpaks to recover people.) Planning in dedicating x2xp weekend and score weekend to “catchup”
---
???
---
I'm on now.
---
Oh shit I was about to lose my mind haha
---
The FPS on mine (PS4) dropped to ZX Spectrum after the update.
---
it can be, sneak auto pistol is ok.
---
I don't think the grind is the biggest issue. It SHOULD be a grind to get all of the rewards for the season. 
---
The issue is requiring DAILY participation to complete it. I would rather do all my grinding on the weekends but in order to complete the battle pass I'll have to log in every day. I don't know of any other battle pass that punishes you so much for taking days off. 
---
As it is, this game has too many daily caps (caps, scrip, bullion). I HATE these caps. I can't even play for more than a couple hours a day because my character is overflowing with legendaries to convert to scrip. Stash is full. 900 scrip. Max caps. And I don't even play as much as a lot of people on here. 
---
It feels like playing 76 is doing a bunch of chores so I can get access the new content.
---
Man I would love a pack brahman mount. Or a motorcycle.
---
Lol no one does pylons. I have to do it myself. I activate all three while spamming 15-20 stimpacks and kill the squatch.
---
A post that gets stuck to the top of the list and always stays there so it's easily seen by all.
---
Side note: let me mount a Mirelurk Queen
---
Just give it some time
---
It was probably someone opening Handmade Gifts. Gifts were every duped item that would give you caps and plans but everyone that has opened a large amount of gifts already have the plans and just need the caps so they drop all the plans
---
I think the best way to prevent that from happening is by helping them out and teaching them about the game so we can show them how the community is
---
I soloed at lvl 80. Power armor, melee build. I also had a bloodied 10mm for the MG turrets. I tried and failed a few times and then took it slow and kinda crept thru the silo, it took a long time. I wouldn't do it again alone, got so frustrated. That was a one and done for me. Also try a difference silo, the time I made it thru I changed up which silo I ran.
---
The more I look into it, it looks like it appears that, if I complete a quest in my quest log, everybody in my party also receives a percentages of the caps and experience that I received based on their Charisma and vice versa. Is this correct? I had it happen once, so I know it's a thing. I guess I'm just curious if events count, as while they do technically show up in the quest tab of the pipboy, they are kind of their own thing at the same time.
---
This is the only thing that works when VATS wont work.
---
Then they play it a week see it isnt cod then leave saying fallout game fornite good
---
Post like this make me glad I play on console.  Every once in a while you run across an individual looking to get their fun at the expense of others.  But semi-rarely.  And I have yet to see an overtly hacked weapon.
---
In all the PS4 community has been fun to interact with
---
haha holy fuck, ive basically been playing non-stop since the update and i'm only level 15. that's going to be a no from me bethesda
---
I don't believe it works with PvE, it does however 100% work with PvP. I tested it again last night, buddy was hitting me for 74 then 49 after I equipped it while on a team with my mule. Equipped and unequipped it 4 or 5 times to be sure. Mule does not have empath.
---
https://help.bethesda.net
---
Interesting! I’ll have to google these handmade gifts. Still learning a lot. I just figured out scrip a few days ago and that has become a new grind.
---
Well tools are useful so thank you very much 😊
---
Nice. I always liked the way SG's looked but never felt comfortable playing them. Same with Les Paul's.. doesnt help they weigh like 30 pounds... lol.
---
Sweet paint job though.
---
There should be a 3* final boss that drops a different key to access the Nuke console. 
---
Nothing worse then going through the effort and resources to get an SBQ event going just so you can get a 1* Lead pipe and some dude just rocks up to the event and gets a 3* guchi gun.
---
Confirmed, SaviorFaire71! When in a group I see the positive buff and the SPECIAL's adjusting +2. However, what seems bugged to me, when solo I see no negative effect icon but I do see my SPECIAL's adjusting down accordingly. Annoying but I'll live :)
---
Easy, loot everything! Work benches aren't that far away inside.
---
Man hearing alot of these stories about how long its taking people to advance, the only thing I can think is man these people are REALLY bad at this game.
---
It's easier now than ever before to get even the hardest events compled now, where even failing still results in a lot of great loot and progression.  
---
You can even cheat by making an alt to compete the level up challenge,  if needed, but the grouping system and buff food is making even that a breeze on my main to attain daily.  
---
And I'm finally making real progress on my bullion grind now that I'm getting into way more events and completing more dailies.
---
If your having a hard time progressing you seriously need to tie yourself to the hip of a more experienced player and see how they optimize their routines and builds, hell some will just straight up make or give you better gear to do so.
---
Stop being so damned anti social and talk with people to get help. This game has some of the most accommodating players I've ever seen who will gladly go out of their way to help peeps out, I'm one of them!
---
Stop sleeping on nuclear winter, the challenges are ridiculously easy and you don't even need to finish the match, but doing so is awarding Halloween and Christmas loot to boot so taking a bit of time each day to get better at pvp is ideal as it still sends xp to your adventure mode grind too.
---
It's not like I even want every single reward item for the season,  theres a handful that really speak to my visual aesthetics I'm after and the rest are just ice bonuses.
---
If you really love the artistry put into some of these cosmetic items it shouldn't be a big deal to toss a couple bucks down to the artists making them.
---
Can things be a better optimized? Sure and I'm sure we will see some improvements with this system since bugs are causing slowdown on progression.  I'm absolutely sure they'll sprinkle in some catch up mechanics before its said and done.
---
So stop giving up and just learn to optimize your routine and strategy, otherwise just go play single player game.
---
I lost some score too to the auto complete bug and I'm not worried about it at all, its getting reported left and right and I'm sure they'll toss some catch ups to make up for it.
---
Theres alot of stuff in this game that I have  no expectation that it will ever be fixed,  but this score system is one of their money making techniques so I'm sure they got alot of eyes watching how it played out. 
---
Quit now and you will lose everything,  versus mebe paying a couple bucks for the items you wanted the most later
---
Kinda depends on a lot of different factors. Everything from armor to play style.
---
Different nuke payloads from doing "legendary" silos? Higher grade payloads increase legendary drops from mobs? Way to give us old whitesprings back with higher level mobs?
---
You can't get gifts anymore but that doesn't mean people aren't sitting on hundreds to thousands of them just cause they or someone they know duped them. I have never duped but I have friends of friends who have so I've opened a good bit of gifts myself
---
Right. Like you don't know.
---
Or they break cause they are useless
---
Don't blueprint. Just pick up and move. As long as you don't destroy the vendors, the stuff should remain inside.
---
Thanks for the information!
---
While Assaultrons and ballistic Gutsy are tough, the worst in my opinion are Gulpers, and mirelurk hunters and kings.
---
As long as you max out the damage perks as you level, it can be done. It may not be as easy as cranking out 5.56 like it's candy, but it'll get the job done. It can also pair great with a VATS crit build, sneak build, or just, y'know, shoot stuff. And frankly, at high level you'll have an easier time finding legendaries at good prices, because it's not as popular.
---
I think reason people leave is the endgame.
---
Only thing you could actually do when you got all the best gear was pvp. Now there is nothing....
---
Junkies effect is one of the bugged (OP) stats already, but I believe it needs to be paired with faster fire rate to achieve the damage. The effect might still work on regular mobs with the explosive hits counting towards a faster fire rate. Explosive shot doesn't count towards SBQ because she is immune to explosive damage. 
---
If I'm being completely honest, I've played with these effects on shotguns as well as the gauss minigun. It just isn't worth it. It trivialized everything about the game, and the game isn't that hard to begin with
---
I’m not familiar. What items are dropping and how? I haven’t really played NW, except once.
---
And PC since the Xbox pass Works on PC too
---
I remember during the freeplay weekend I beat a kid to death with my bare hands and he wouldn't shut up about wanting to eat me. Hope more cannibal children arrive so I can People's Elbow them or smth!
---
I'm logging on and doing the exact same routine every time and it's getting tiresome.
---
Log in.
---
Do my Photos/Raider/Foundation run for bullion/notes and rep (started late, still grinding to Ally with both).
---
Knock off a boring checklist for SCORE (build and scrap some items, do an event, collect a pointless scrap resource).
---
Do a Whitesprings run to knock off the level up / xp challenges.
---
Log off.
---
That’s awesome. You’re doing parenting right. Well done,sir!
---
Pretty much this.
---
I'm keen. Finally be able to give some of my plans to players that can learn them rather than just dumping them to be lost forever
---
Try millions.
---
I want to plant cranberries
---
So I can just place my camp down in a different location without blueprinting it and my vendors won't clear?
---
For real lol 😂
---
I started on XBox but migrated to PC for mods.
---
I and a lot of people found it gave the score reward at 3/5 instead of when it was actually completed, so there's a good chance that's what happened, still frustrating though
---
It does make you look hella cool tho
---
Yes and no, submit a ticket is all I can say.
---
But remember, double XP &amp; double S.C.O.R.E. weekend are around the corner.
---
I find this much more preferable to Fortnite. I play on PS4 though so not nearly as many sketchy members running around as for PC FO76’ers.It’s a small community (in an given week I see the same couple hundred players multiple times) but fun IMO.  
---
I typically don’t mind the bush campers as long as they aren’t on my team.  They help pad my stats!
---
Hackers problems were solved. The third party app does not work anymore. About afkers, who cares? Free xp and  Faster matchs (both to start and end)
---
I’d be open to anything honestly as having three identical makes no sense, let alone never deviating in their contents or requirements. 
---
This game is woefully lax on end game content already so making the effective “end” mission that way isn’t ideal. 
---
More enemy types or enemies varying from silo to silo to suit different builds.
---
Harder enemies to remove the ease factor which just hastens boredom and feelings of same old same old. More assaultrons for bot silo, a silo with deranged plant life  the vault from new Vegas etc. 
---
Remove the tedious cargobot precursor mission for something better, to make it and the silo run more involving rather than just a dungeon and having to piss about trying to catch/shoot a flying thing that hovers out of range half the time you want it and that’s all the difficulty and involvement it has. 
---
I know the whole enclave thing is the run up to the nuke silo and that’s fine, but it’s a repeatable event and the enclave run up isn’t, so it needs to be better for the long term bomb droppers and silo runners. 
---
I’d love to see more NPC involvement now wastelanders is out. It would be perfect to add that factor to it now, potential speech checks, random run up missions or NPCS to help newbies, make it a huge fight like the ending of becketts mission, I dunno.
---
I’ve already said I think the online community is nice. Flex that empathetic muscle a bit dude. If I’m saying I don’t want to be exposed to a situation where my entire night would be ruined by some bad shit then trust me when I say it. 
---
Let’s not pretend there isn’t some weird ass connection that somehow happened between politics and games. No need to name drop - but after watching endless discussion through the years about controversial statements made by beloved high-vis personalities, I’m chill on it all. 
---
The wasteland is FULL of nice folks, every interaction I’ve had so far has been good. 
---
I know myself enough to know where I draw my line.
---
What’s the challenge? When you first get to Whitesprings, don’t shoot the bots. They are on your side
---
Grabbing a pylons should count as having tagged the legendaries currently up. Would vastly change people's unwillingness to do anything but Kill stuff.
---
Who miss the atomic atoms challenges?
---
Suggestions? Get rid of TSE it's one of the worst weapons you can get.
---
Not sure what game mode you're targeting, so will assume you're looking for general all around open world build. 
---
I recently swapped to commando perks from rifle and am loving it.  
---
Medic is not really useful when running Unyielding armor.  A diluted stimpack will be enough to heal you w/o medic perk.   Transfer that point to Agility or Luck.   
---
Drop the day/night perks.  Up your Bloody Mess.
---
Somebody else suggested max blocker.  I disagree.  I run a sneak commando build and don't get involved with melee guys.  Besides, you have Serendipity and Lone Wanderer to help with that.  
---
I am running lead belly 3 and good salt 3.  I have tried getting away from those for more DPS cards, but don't enjoy not having them.  Lead belly makes it easier to manage rads and good salt helps me collect heaps of meat to sell for caps. 
---
I don't have a TSE gun, so don't know about the effectiveness of Demolition Expert 5 with that weapon.  I am running a 5 in INT (nerd rage 3, gunsmith 2) with a 12 AGIL and 14 LUCK.  Consider dropping some INT to be able to run Class Freak in LUCK?
---
A bunch of skins from previous the halloween and christmas NW events are dropping atm, based on the xp you earn in NW.
---
There were a couple of posts in this sub on it, i'll see if i can find one that lists the drops.
---
EDIT: [Here ya go](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hj8wac/psa_here_are_the_nw_christmas_and_halloween/)
---
It's only paid passes where have an issue. Those should unlock everything at the end of the season if you didn't unlock it during the season seeing as you paid for it.
---
Free ones i understand. It's all about forcing you to log in as often as possible.
---
Valid comment, sorry for the understatement
---
Before this season I could potentially get over 6000 Atoms in the same amount of time, which I could use freely to purchase whatever cosmetics and camp items I wanted. That's enough reason to complain in my book.
---
There’s a weekly challenge to kill a range of different bots for SCORE.
---
You can get a lower level sentry at the rail yard north of the White Spring. Or at least cover so you don’t get murdered.
---
This game has one of the friendliest player bases of any I've seen. I see higher levels helping out new players a lot with food and water and gear. I had a few people randomly drop stuff for me before so I pay it forward.
---
I am just now playing NW (Level 135 in Adventure) because of the daily SCORE.  I have to admit, it is pretty fun, had my first squad win due to very lucky drop location, and the ring centering on our team every time. 
---
I’m very terrible at the combat aspect but I think I’m ok at finding a clean path and avoiding death. 
---
That being said, the time between matches is awful. It’s at least 5 minutes from when I end one match until I’m loaded in the next. That needs to be cut down to 90 seconds for it to feel worth it.
---
There is a blue baseball batting helmet
---
the weekly challenge called "destroy assorted robots", where else can i find these robots but hostile and lower level?
---
&gt;granted by my own choice.
---
It's not your fault or choice, not really. Fear of being left out, missing out, having less, and not 'winning' are all pretty primal feelings. It's exactly why live services use FOMO to manipulate people and why it's such an effective tactic.
---
What Bethesda apparently haven't factored in is that making it such a chore that people burn out or just give up can be devastating to their desire to play. That, or they are counting on Steam and Game Pass to funnel in enough new wallets to make up for the attrition.
---
Go to garrahan mining hq where you get excavator armour from is best bet if you’re too underlevelled etc for a silo run or whitespring. 
---
The vertibot is easy at the fly swatter event, otherwise there’s usually plenty flying about for nuke escorts, and occasionally one lands/is around the power station vertipad.
---
Also. Use vats to target combat inhibitors just lay in wait hidden and ambush them when they turn
---
Vertibot. Top of world when a nuke card transport comes by
---
Most people are pretty nice and will help out with low levels, and some are only out for them selves. But I suggest playing, I was really intimidated when I started but was hooked right away
---
Been broken off and on for a while. I rely on VATS myself. If you are fairly close and miss the first 2 shots, exit VATS and re-enter. Will work fine after that.
---
thanks ill go after that one, and the others?
---
Specially since it glitches out and won't let everyone even participate in dailies!
---
No, what I meant was, I've seen players with millions each.
---
Vats bow it's a real nightmare, but crossbow don't have the same problems for me, what wrong Bethesda ? You miss something during the bow development, or complete VATS development ? 🤡
---
Just have the legendary loot automatically go into your inventory like event items do. It’s not a crazy concept or fix.
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
Doesnt hitting the imposter even with her shields up still count as tagging him? Where legendaries are concerned?
---
They are hoping you spend atoms.
---
It's a bug that I've heard may be fixed tomorrow. Ive gotten the Christmas presents and tree and the skeleton suit.
---
I think you fit into that category
---
I'm not trying to simply add wallpaper, I wanted to replace my floor with another type to better match the wallpaper. I feel like you might not have read the post.
---
After three relogs and a hard reset it started letting me replace things again, but after I built and altered some stuff it happened again. Thought it was because my budget became maxed, but I've actually still got room so I'm not sure what the bug is.
---
I wouldn’t say hate, it just gets frustrating doing the same old same old. I love this game a lot, but boy can it really grind my gears sometimes
---
Nope I work , volunteer and take care of 4 dogs and am level 26 cause I play maybe 1 hour a day not hard manage your time stop whining some of us don't waste what little we. Have
---
I usually play both, but this gets me in there every day, I like having a goal when playing.
---
It's almost like there are lots of white people in West Virginia...
---
Smfh
---
I’ve started playing a side character who’s a sneaky assassin who’ll be part of the order even if she’s doing it alone
---
Are they still banning for that?
---
It is pretty pathetic isn't it?  
---
We need more Rust players to shake things up. Wtf.
---
No I havent had any issues with any of the grinding in this game like some people have it is hard or time consuming it is just people wanting to whine to whine nothing more
---
If it was ps4 you're welcome, was just cleaning out my stash.
---
As a bloodied build I've found it to be more important  that I kill as many robots as possible because they start stacking up so quickly that they can crash the server with the intensity of the lag.  
---
By just downing as many as I can it allows everyone to much more freely move about. That and it doesn't take me much time at all to 1 shot a dozen robots.
---
I woulda grabbed the pylons but it's pretty annoying being 1 person with all 3 and dying before getting a shot off
---
It was, thanks so much!!
---
I was under the impression it cleared when u moved....
---
I was an avid Destiny player since day 1 of the first game. Gave up on Destiny 2 three months ago and deleted it. The boring loop of grinding tiresome activities to unlock battle pass items got incredibly stale. I loved that game and they drove me away from it. It all became about squeezing the absolute most out of very minimal content while getting you to log in daily for menial tasks for small amounts of progression. It became a boring, tedious, monotonous experience, so i left.
---
Yep, Fallout 76 is going the same way. For me, i haven't spent years with this game like i had Destiny, so the day to day hasn't become a massive chore quite yet, but yes, i can see it slowly going in exactly the same direction.
---
It all comes down to one big problem. Games companies simply cannot create content at the rate that we can consume it, so they have to drag out minimal content through slow, monotonous grinds and doing things like putting daily limits on currencies etc you can earn.
---
I understand it, but i'm not happy about it.
---
Free on game pass, need an Xbox though.
---
Yes. Because you deserve things for free?
---
Its the same problem just an FYI, a monthly fee to access the game. Then the games not technically free.
---
So? 
---
God forbid a company try to earn some money.... While giving you free DLC and the choice to spend money on a season or not (and will still give you free shot if you don't)
---
you mean the north Appalachian central train yard? i'm there now and all i see is level 60 monsters not a bot in sight :(
---
The Marine Tactical Helmet does protect. This is the one that looks like a wetsuit hood. I had a really old one in my inventory that didn't. A newly crafted one does work though.
---
I put first aid to 3, refractor to 3 and chug med-x, still burn through stimpaks while claiming all 3 pylons. Gotta try sb steak- thanks for the tip.
---
Fireproof in endurance . Get it. You don’t need gunsmith equipment, you have too much intelligence. Adrenaline is broken, use dodgy for now. And I don’t know how you carry any ammo without the lighter weight perk card?
---
Do the flyswatter event for veritbot
---
Do every other bot because you dont NEED to do sentry or assaultron
---
I got one and I was lucky I saw it on reddit because I didn't see it in reward gifts but randomly stumbled upon it in my inventory. I nearly just put it on my vendor but I was extremely lucky to find someone that gave me all 4 rare fasnacht masks for it. We both got what we wanted
---
interesting, so lw+empath+dodgy+suppressor  should generate a pretty defensive pvp build. Did you test this in a private or in a public team?
---
Apparently you can't read. In another comment I clearly stated I don't play alot any more, not daily and often not for a few days at a time. 
---
Where I said, at best I'll likely get half way through.
---
Because as I said. I work. Have a family. And other shit.
---
I love when people make assumptions. It makes them look like assholes. 
---
Especially sad for a fellow middle ager
---
Do you have a friend that trusts you to actiavate their account on your console so you can use their plus?
---
No they're aren't, it gives items that are meant to have a practical purpose and throws different currency at you... its not just cosmetic
---
Gurantee in future seasons they won't put the Ammo Converter equivalent at the start.
---
i did find an assaultron level 40 here and holy shit it killed me in 1 hit...thanks bethesda for these amazing challenges that everyone can do...
---
I literally don't have friends who play games lol only other person uses my account
---
Found a bloody +10 damage 15% vats handmade last night for 2k
---
That's a fair rebuttal but as the previous poster mentioned, this an alternative reality game. It may be a predominantly white populated state,  but as you mentioned yourself, a lot of the migration would be coming from "Up North" where there are tons of POC communities. On the other hand it's really cool that previous games have reflected the demographics in the localities, but as a POC myself it would be fun to have the option of more diverse skins.
---
Still bugged. When I use VATS it almost always has a 95% chance to hit... As long as I pull that trigger immediately. Otherwise it could be a total crapshoot. Sometimes you'll see 95% and miss no matter how many shots you take, sometimes it works like it should.
---
Either way the lengthy reload times make bows basically useless compared to any other build except pistols.
---
I'm still trying to make them work, but even from stealth I find them pretty lacking.
---
Np it's a mini dear head, looks kinda odd
---
Huh. Do you have an image?
---
Launching nukes just seem tedious to me. If it is just different floor plans, with 50 computer tapes in a different spot, it is not going to help. I have zero interest in launching nukes. Make it FUN, make it engaging, make it rewarding. Fix 25 pipes and wreck 50 computer tapes type content is soul sucking bad.
---
I'll add CAMP building to that. I have never been so frustrated at a game before. Especially one that isn't really PvP. 
---
So many quality of life improvements possible there.
---
I don’t know, but possibly it’s the major events (a hexagon with an exclamation mark) only? Both of the events you noted are major events.
---
It’s the future/s
---
Mmm.
---
Vertibot - fly swatter event, just shoot it until it’s dead.
---
Sentry bot: repco building.  It is near some cars so blow them up...if you have concentrated fire perk then focus on its fusion cores to blow it up instantly.
---
There are sometimes pulse mines and grenades in the trucks on the road upto to the repco building...but the easiest way to is stealth shoot the fusion cores from behind
---
Assaultron: probably arktos pharma where project paradise takes place..if you have a shotgun and the right perk just cripple her legs and then her head and she can’t hurt you anymore.
---
The wetsuit itself does as well
---
Ah I didnt think of that! Those are excellent points as well. No idea the new lead in BOS is of a different background. That'll be fun to explore.
---
Well, I've got the clean sink and the ammo converter. If i can get the star wallpaper, I'll be satisfied.
---
Just tried to link from Google but can't apparently. Google fallout 76 score fireplace
---
If will if you destroy the stuff. Yes. If you place from stored it won't
---
Is there a recipe for Nuka cola cranberry? I tried googling to see if there was one but I didn’t find anything.
---
The mighty atom took it as a tithe to his glory
---
that's good to know! thanks!
---
My first encounter with blood eagles I was level 24. It did not go well. 
---
For anyone that wants to know, sniping is not the best way to deal with their camps at low level....
---
"Too easy"
---
But i like them :(
---
Does that really fix that shit?
---
They're pretty awful compared to almost any gun. Looking at you broadsider. But, I find it fun anyhow.
---
I have not played a game yet that gets the bow right. 
---
Red dead, the arrow is put on the left side of the bow when you are holding the bow in your left hand
---
You're mistaken, no event gives score. They've said so here - https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hjvw0c/what_is_the_official_answer_from_bethesda_on_how/fwpcpyg/
---
There is an upcoming weekly that will grant score for public events that was datamined. 
---
SCORE_Challenge_Weekly_QuestComplete_Events_RECURRING "REPEATABLE: Complete a Public Event"
---
I hate all of the NPCs..
---
I wish I could shoot many more of them in the face to death than the game allows me to..
---
Maybe you built near Charleston train station which causes the random vendor to not spawn? But people build there all the time and I just server hop. Where did you build- now I'm curious.
---
They're saying that previously they could've gotten far more with the same effort. That's not getting things free.
---
It might be bugged, because I completed the event daily for today, then did Line In The Sand, and still got 100 score.
---
I’ve had moments where my VATS cost 0 AP and literally doesn’t miss on any percentage. Happened when I was using a 50cal Machine Gun on the Queen, but then it fixed and started costing AP again after it flew away and was out of range. This game is just full of all sorts of issues. Not to mention the VATS doing no damage is just as bad as the missing on 95%’s.

I posted this very suggestion back before the game was released and this forum was a lot more fun. That suggestion was shot down as "stupid" and I was told I didn't know what I was talking about.
---
thanks ill give it a try
---
Damn, thanks for the info.
---
&gt;Let’s not pretend there isn’t some weird ass connection that somehow happened between politics and games. No need to name drop - but after watching endless discussion through the years about controversial statements made by beloved high-vis personalities, I’m chill on it all. 
---
Dude what the hell are you even talking about
---
I used an anti armour, fr crossbow forever on my original stealth ( non bloody) character.  
---
Trivialised most things.
---
I don’t understand this community. I wasn’t even complaining. Stop assuming negative intent.
---
Been waiting for the succulent bundle to come back since I got into the game!
---
&gt; Xp farming isn't a good gaming experience.
---
I so agree with you.
---
Up to a certain point in this game, XP is useful.  Once you have all of the Perk cards you need and you're past Level 50, what's the point?  I've been playing since pre-beta and I'm at Level 375 right now.  I could've been past Level 1,000 right now if I'd intentionally farmed XP.  But that seems so pointless.  I'm going to be dead someday.
---
I'm fine with Gulpers since I've got 2 Poison Resistance armor pieces. Hunters and Kings are still a problem, though.
---
Thank you I appreciate it and stay safe, also I would like to say I very much agree with you on this topic and I wish it was that way because it would be so much nicer for people like us, more convenient.
---
I think it's just the jaded side of me that says "just take what you can get" cuz I'm just happy I can play it without server crashes n it runs well on my One X or my PC, n also I love Fallout.
---
Hell my trophies for it changed from 70% to 66%
---
PC, you?
---
Just look at vendors who sell Meat Hooks and buy them and scrap them, you'll learn that mod faster than you'll find it that way.
---
Good points, aside from the species levels...my argument isnt that there are no POC, but rather the lack of variation and  diversity of POC (Asian, Latino, Middle Eastern, etc). To place  a female and blacks as the heads of the two biggest factions is a great thumbs up, but there are other POC. I suppose my initial poster's message wasn't clear.
---
That's the repeatable daily kicking in.
---
EDIT: Not daily, but weekly. Every 10k XP gives 100 S.C.O.R.E.

I think I learned the plan from scrapping. I might have the mod in my vendor also. Not positive though. I’ll be on later. Itzcmiltzertime
