Repairing a gun to 100% when i can repair it to 200% at a bench is not pay 2 win. If the kits repaired it over 200% than those saying p2w would have an arguement.
---
---
---
This is just another step in a long line of movements forward that they’ve been taking to get to this. Remember the health buff you’d get if your team were each wearing a piece of clothing from The Unstoppables set? They’ll keep doing more stuff like this until you’re shelling out real money to win the game. This might not be what determines it, but we’re getting damn close. They swore Atomic Shop items would be cosmetic only. Repair kits are not cosmetic. 
---
I pop on for a few hours a week.
---
Maybe now they will  haha
---
Wow so many salty people upset that you found an effective way to survive in a game thats about...survival.
---
Lol nah nobody is going to pay 25 fluxes for a repair away from bench.
---
Coming from the one whos rich and wealthy and can buy anything he wants. I want some money.
---
There's something to be said for variety though.  You do have some of the highly wasted, harsh environments like the Toxic Valley and the Ash Heap, as well as more overgrown but even more hostile environments like the Mire and the Cranberry Bog.  I'd say I prefer having those and the nicer forested environments instead of exclusively the badlands of the earlier games.
---
What do you mean? What does it fix?
---
No they haven't as they are likely having internal meetings on how to proceed and not to be rude what you hears is complete BS. The "factory new" is a meme about how the shop was only supposed to be cosmetic and no clue where you got that low level thing from
---
Stimpacks are also heavy...100 in your stashbox eats up alot of space...I usually keep 40 since they are abundant especially with the pharma perk
---

---
Yes! I loved how in-depth it was. Not to be negative but a lot of locations on the map can be shallow, towns with houses that you can’t go in, or houses that you can go in that just have junk inside. I really was hoping there’d be more cool locations like this one. 
---
The Fermenter is tied to your Stash, and can only be built/used at your own CAMP, not a friends, or a workshop.  It lists all the usable items in your Stash.  You can place beer (fermented and non fermented) inside your Fermenter directly, and it will just be added to your stash and "activated" on the fermenter.
---
Up to 10 items from your inventory/stash can be activated on the Fermenter.  It just makes it ferment faster.  Fermentation time is indicated by the Condition bar of the beer/wine/spirit.
---
Well said.
---
You don't have to drop it. Just go where one has been dropped. At the end players drop excess they don't need or can't sell.
---
Yes
---
Thanks for the reply, I was wondering which way would be more convenient. I’ll drop by one of these times
---
that's a plus
---
I was using 3 Handmade Rifles on a full Commando character and switched to an Assault Rifle/10mm SMG for this exact reason.
---
It’s been kind of fun setting up all the new guns to fit different roles, but I miss my other 2 Handmade Rifles. It was so cool only relying on one ammo type too. 
---
To be honest it was ridiculously OP like 1 of 3 thing? 
---
No because most people don't do those including myself. The challenges are silly and with too many steps. 
---
I have no problem with the condition mechanics in general, FO76 is meant to be survival-lite MMORPG after all, but I agree with OP that the devs shouldn't change game mechanics to force players to spend real money.
---
The fact that they never reversed the 'fix' regarding dispersion of canned food rewards from the "Feed the People" shows they blatantly don't give a damn about what the community wants.  
---
The demand to revert the quest reward mechanics back to its original form was pretty much a very vocal and unanimous demand.  It was also a very easy fix.
---
Well your post called into the validity of Bethesda’s statements that Anyone had Ever posted about repair kits, I linked you a thread on there just so you’d stop spreading smears. Be careful with the words you use because it changes the entire context at times. 
---
Wait until they make canned dog food supplies only available in the atom store. Or nerf them and require you to use a can opener which is only available in the atom store.
---
Its definitely one of my favs on the map. Not too many I can think of like it
---
very good work.. now where did the Leader go after leaving Sutton church?
---
OK that has happened to me but usually if I just reload I have the same amount of cores as normal
---
Oh pay to win, joy.
---
It is a clear advantage in combat because one can pay to have longer weapon duration and therefore more consistent damage output. Unlimited even. PvP, PvE - both are completely buyable wins with these kits. 100/200 % makes no difference, it's the same effect. One would just be using them twice as often.
---
The struggle is real. I work on a college campus and there’s so much plastic scrap left on the ground. That and my department works with e-waste so there’s always fun electronics to take apart and make into different things, like a red-dot scope on a Nerf blaster made from an old projector remote with a laser pointer built in.
---
The arch does damage. That may be the reason. But just a guess. They attach mine also.
---
Since 2 came out. Still playing 76 because I still haven't explored the whole map, and certain parts of the map still mean certain death for me. Though I've been playing 4 a lot more now.
---
And what if giving them money is how they are able to eat at night?
---
/Sarcasm
---
thanks for that, I wasn't aware of this promise.  I'm still going to play the game as long as it's fun, but ... I just hope it stays fun.  
---
Nothing on this sub so far
---
We all know Bethesda has money but the thing is there not satisfied with how much they have they want more and are now putting getting money before everything else
---
I just recently started playing again. I've been playing since fallout 3 and did get it because it's fallout with friends and one that will be receiving content for years to come according to Todd. I'm about level 60 but haven't ever launched a nuke and still have quests to finish but wish there was more end game activities to get good loot, I hardly ever come across legendary gear that I want. I know a new dungeon is coming and vault raids and other new content so I'm mostly looking forward to that. I was a supportive of the no npc thing for awhile and there still is something about it that makes the world feel eerie but it's a double edged sword. I think they need to start populating with npcs at least slowly. The quests would be more interesting that way.
---
Here’s hoping they fix it—how am I supposed to represent the Vault with janky placement bugs???
---
But this takes away from the fun of getting plans and building something that looks like what u want only totally broken and useless.  Like why would any person in the known universe build a toilet that does not work! but we will in this universe and we will like it!
---
So do I. My main fear is that to make people want to buy these things they will make the non-paid alternatives more annoying.
---
Tbh having some hygiene mechanic would be fun. Like if you wash using purified waters and soap you get higher disease resistance.
---
And the need to defecate and urinate.
---
Give toiletpaper an actual purpose too.
---
Like if you just poop in the wild you have like 75% disease change.
---
Use TP and it drops to 25%
---
And if you do it on an actual toilet it drops another 25% thus taking away any disease risk.
---
You can sell a TD to a vendor for 1 cap. Exit the vendor.  Then re-enter the vendor and buy back the TD for 2. It will trigger the event. Keep your extras in your stash and only have the one in your inventory. I did this the other day.
---
Upcoming enhanced items to include bbqs that generate hotdogs every x minutes and nuka cola machine that restocks with random nuka cola every x minutes...
---
Only in the ATOM store.
---
Or a robot you can purchase that harvests your crops and auto stores them in your fridge.
---
I run a 3-star weightless marine armor set that has 40% reduced ammo weight, 40% reduced weapon weight, 20% reduced aids weight.  this is what u want cause with Bandolier I am able to carry 10k bullets and still weigh under 150lbs total carrying.
---
I miss them from FO4...had a cute little "entertainment" are in Sanctuary Hills with the games, disco ball, gym equipment, etc. Lots of people hung out there once the "shops" at the entrance closed for the night.
---
I'm on the "stop your whining" team. 
---
It's not either/or. 
---
The *are* working on fixing stuff, as well as new content. 
---
This.
---
Loved it since three. Fo4 is my favourite, but 76 is a very close second, and would be my favourite if it weren’t for the clusterfuck launch. Still, I play 76 so much. I love it. 
---
Bulking Aluminum and Lead for space saving, everything else for selling. Things you can't bulk already have a sell value.
---
I have those. I don't get what is special. They're part of the camp building menu. Maybe you need plans but they have been avaliable for some time.
---
Are you aware that the proposed repair kits aren’t even the highest quality version you can obtain? The higher version is gotten ingame as a drop from be SBQ, I believe. 
---
No one would be forced to buy this. 
---
I have a problem similar to this but my issue is I'm constantly pulling apart plastic pens and toilet plungers to make combat armor.
---
[removed]
---
Anything with images in what would otherwise be plain text is probably going to drain a lot of memory. 
---
I don’t know about “tarnish your name for ever”. It yeah I agree. 
---
The game attracted a lot of different types of people who all play differently so a lot of view points comes from that. Reddits algorithm for pushing things to the top can also be a bit odd at times.
---
Um, you are definitely too white to get that saying right🤣
---
Hey, I get it. That was just my idea to try and make them a bit harder to get and a bit more valuable. But if you got an idea, throw it out there. I’m interested in other ways to make them. :)
---
I appreciate the variety of biomes, and understand that this is a prequel so things aren't necessarily as utterly destroyed. I'm just also perfectly happy in a large wasteland that is less alive. The interesting thing is, Bethesda can age and evolve the game world if they want to.
---
They have confirmed that it is a thing that will happen at some point, but not when. 
---
So here is my opinion.  You may not like it , but just think about it!  
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
1.  Fallout 76 requires money to continue running.
---
2. Bethesda will not keep this game running if they spend more than they make.
---
3. Bethesda stated they would not put items in the atom shop that would give players an edge.  - For this I would argue that these repair kits do not truly give anyone an advantage.  There are so many places throughout the wasteland where I can repair my stuff that this really does not matter.  
---
4. Would you prefer an item like this gets added or would you want Bethesda to end up being influenced into adding weapons and armor that can only be obtained through atom shop purchases?
---
I should get a couple of those restaurant salt and pepper and sugar packets and weigh them and send them in. Oh, and Taco Bell sauce packets. Those things last forever. Mmm. Spicy Rad rat tacos.
---
Its still not play to win!
---
Have over 200 hours in this game and if this pay to win shit starts happening im deleting the game maybe focus less on the item shop and give us some new deep quest to show your appreciation to the few who haven't turned there back on you 
---
I had a weightless set at first with the chameleon mutation and I found that I was spotted much easier than I do with multiple pieces of chameleon armor
---
Oh man, I'd have to gently put the controller down for a minute lol
---
I think they got rid of Bankruptcy Timer/Disease.
---
There's a problem: they're still giving away free atoms. If they cut prices too far too fast, they may find people can buy everything with free atoms and revenue dries up dead. Since raising prices isn't an option, they're exploring the remaining possibility space: sales, time-limited objects, artificial scarcity, etc.
---
Both, neither seems to affect the bar. Been playing since beta but this is the first time I've seen since bug. 
---
I believe NV was produced by Obsidian. Need I say more? I played the crap out of it. And will again.
---
I had this problem back when black op2 came out. Played it 2 straight days. I ended up seeing the X button on doors and objects to use/open them. 
---
Mostly the same for me, though I didn't actually manage to own or play the games until around 2001 (I had no computer until then, but I watched friends play both 1 and 2, we even made tabletop rpg rules based on the first game before I managed to get a PC).
---
I've seen it in the past, and think they are a good idea, but not in the Atom shop. Make them craftable, or drops from enemies. I don't like the pay to win tactic they are going with.
---
Im not sure, do raw special-vallues factor into the Prices aswell ? My character is almost supermutant-level when it comes to intelligence :p
---
It’s also unfair to expect the Obsidian loyalty equal to Bethesda loyalty, imo. But agreed, the number should be higher by this point.
---
That's our problem Bethesda now's moders will fix the game not them this is our fault by letting Bethesda get lazy and rely on the community to fix the game not them
---
I think you are misconstruing the numbers, according the Steamcharts Fallout NV in the month of March about 2500 people playing on Steam at or “active” at any given time...I don’t think Fallout New Vegas has 5 million active players on PS3 last month. 
---
So... instead of contacting Bethesda using their website/forums and putting in a ticket to notify them of this dupping glitch, you thought it be best to express it to the whole community so it could be exploited (if not already). 😂😂😂😂😂
---
Sry man I hear your intension but there’s always lurkers to take advantage.  
---
 
---
All the Fanboys down voting your post. Thank you for bringing up the dumpster fire filled with fail and aids, called fallout 76 : fan boy edition
---
**(Bethesda can do no wrong, take my money)**
---
And Reddit Posts with Stairs Coming Soon After!
---
it was their attempt to put more bodies in survival without doing too much
---
My biggest issue is that they said they wouldn't do this, then they did it anyways. 
---
Yes I know it currently isn't. I'm referring to how this could possibly end. Quality of life equipment in the store begins making it pay to enjoy, like any mobile game. Makes no gameplay logic that I can't just craft repair kits but instead can buy them from the atomic shop. No one right now is saying that this one is thing will ruin the game but to think it'll just stop is stupid
---
"Doc, my arm hurts when I lift it like this"
---
Since Wasteland 1 in 1988. :)
---
theres no response that wont make things worse, especially since community managers typically only talk to the devs, not the publishers so much, and the publishers are the ones making this dumb ass decision 
---
Can’t you just load up on orbital strikes and wipe them and their bases out?
---
You cant anymore they ruined it with last patch.
---
Sweet Christmas. I use an SSD in my PC for this reason, and while windows is slow, my games never lack for performance.
---
Good to know I can use this on my Xbox. Thank you kind, wonderful sir/ma’am.
---
Well then they need to not use language that makes it sound like people have been rabid on requesting these.Which I maintain,they haven't.Many,many other things have been repeatedly requested more than fucking repair kits...lol.
---
Well if they get away with the repair kits they will keep moving away from the right side of the line.    Bethesda will keep putting more pay to win items in as long as people defend it and buy it.  
---
Read the inside the vault article it explains most of what they’re proposing.
---
The problem with 76 is Bethesda's failure to address serious issues. Like disappearing inventory items. Invisible players. Just to name two. It's not that these things happen. It's Bethesda's failure to correct them.
---
The cost of repairing a weapon is up to 10 of junk, and junk might be various. Anything above combined: "10 gear 10 spring 10 screw 10 steel 10 wood 10 rubber" would be an overkill for the value you get.
---
I think Grahm mentions that a "smartie" inspired him to do trade. I imagine he had some kind of encounter with a human or Fawkes-like Super Mutant in the past.
---
Your amazing thank you so much
---
I have 2 on my PC! I didnt realize USB 3 was actually faster than sata and spinner. I think spinner was .5gb/s and ssd was 5-6gb/s.
---
This \^ and not just the economy, but the entire illusion of scarcity in a post apocalyptic world.
---
How many stars on the bloodied rifle?
---
I mean, survival mode is about surviving. They are doing so.
---
No, they are not awesome obviously, if they were they would respond already. Dont kiss someones ass if they dont wipe it themself.
---
Nice! I plan to rebuild mine in the near future, but in the meantime, gotta go shopping for a new drive. Birthday closing in and all. Lol.
---
Is the bloodied hunting rifle max lvl and if it is how much you want for it?
---
Douchebag...
---
And that’s a *noticeably large* difference!
---
Snowflake triggered! Meltdown commencing....
---
Part of the game, isn't it? Would be pretty boring if survival mode was just another spoopy battle royale, right? Give me a challenge! 
---
What if we charged an entry fee to watch and do betting where house takes a cut and charge winners a flat 5 caps from what they gain from the pk 
---
interesting, I have noticed that Cloaking armor seems to not work.
---
It's wise not to pick up a known plan. Picking it up starts a clock. Another plan won't spawn there for you until the clock runs out. If you leave it and server hop a different plan will be there. Some plan spawns never change. But many rotate thru a set of plans.
---
Its funny your first paragraph was my exact experience today. I was running around getting my crits and xp. 1hr later was top of the leaderboard. Joy!! 😂😂
---
IF ITS PVE, IS IT REALLY ILLEGAL?
---
NO. ITS NOT. 
---
Seems like a solid strategy to me. 
---
Sounds... not too fun. I like the idea of traps/defenses being an actual threat in PVP. 
---
Maybe there could be an “Attack and Defend” game type where Camps aren’t as destructible (just certain things like traps, turrets) would be 
---
Just farm the caps for it. We recently made the neon letter purchase 2 times so it was close to 20K farmed over 2 weeks by 2 People. So.. mediocre gaming might get you 20K in 4 weeks?
---
No one would dupe power armor people literally give it away for free, here he has a chance for someone that can maybe recommend a way to fix it while a support ticket wouldnt give much help besides “we will look into it”
---
Seems like an interesting wrinkle to the pvp formula. If only camps were more hard to defeat without invincible camp exploits...
---
Dumb people:  repair kits are p2w cuz they can idk repair things?                                                         Smart people: Cosmetics give others the advantage of looking cooler than me to they are P2W /s
---
TSEs make Survival not fun.  I've had a blast until I hear that distinctive crackle and see the reload screen before I can even turn around or even register what's happened.   
---
I don't mind being killed, that's what I signed up for.  But we know the vast majority of those TSEs that steamroll over people in pvp were duped, because they absolutely can not be that common.
---
The duping issue will cripple Survival until it is fixed. 
---
Oh my god, let a group wear the clothing set. 
---
For a small bonus that food can give you?
---
Just had to poke in here. Don't hate on No Man's sky. Game is amazing right now. Perfect example of a bad game turned amazing.

Hi! Your post has automatically been removed because your post's title appears to be in breach of rule 6:
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/fo76) if you have any questions or concerns.*
---
Yeah same here with the second weapon
---
Even if you stop buying the games the people who are paying for these microtransactions won’t. And I bet they give enough money to make up for lack of sales from those who don’t like the.  
---
Bethesda: “we’ve listened to your feedback and have instituted repair kits”
---
Your post: “I haven’t seen one post requesting repair kits before this announcement or anything remotely close...just calling bullshit Bethesda”
---
So tell me who’s engaging in rabid hyperboles again? Lots of people on the forums at Bethesda.net have asked for this as well so I think you drawing from your select sample size and calling it the gospel is disingenuous. 
---
Yes other things have been requested and Bethesda has said they have more planned, so your point is that they have to follow the direct orders of the subreddit on how they develop the game? That’s dumb af, they take good ideas and develop them and some might be easier to implement than others and thus get released sooner. 
---
I’m just calling you out for acting like people were hating on you on your post, nope we just showed you the threads you said didn’t exist but you wanna act like your Jesus Christ getting persecuted here.. lol right back at ya buddy.
---
I really hope they don't make them too easy to get outside of the Atomic Shop. If they're too easy to get I'll never feel like I'm getting my money's worth by spending my Atoms on them.
---
Please Bethesda, don't make me feel like I'm wasting my money by giving these things away too freely in-game. #nowelfarerepairs
---
Yeah team gets loot. 
---
No xp though. They have to be close.
---
Do you have 5 pieces of chameleon? 
---
Not the armour itself can be taken advantage of. What you can add to it. Regardless still a mechanical issue of the game that only the Dev can correct then update  
---
He who controls the spice, controls the universe.
---
Stop.
---
Repair kits are not pay to win.
---
Bulk the junk you use, Lose the junk you don't  
---
Store your ammo on your body not in ur stash.  It will fill up with fusion cores, missles,cannonballs and mini-nukes in no time (also 1 good weight reduction gear with bandolier will decrease ammo weight loads)  
---
Watch the Aids, Boiled waters and stimpac take mucho space  
---
I was thinking earlier how it would be fun to build the best “maze” you can and hide in that. Fill it with traps and stuff. Would be fun till someone blew it up. 😛
---
your team gets loot, but only gets XP if they deal damage to something you kill
---
I let him tag as many enemies as possible. That should get him xp.
---
He was good at shooting at everything to tag it. 
---
When you have it yes, what about when purchasing in a store?
---
I am at launch control. Ready to push button. Wants to join here. Gt GrumpyDude 
---
And then theres the issue of many people blaming the game/servers when it's their shitty systems or internet at fault
---
Ehh I'll do it for 20 caps... What lvl are you?
---
Damn I was about to sign up for my new lvl 10 but not on PC...
---
sounds like a great way to have fun while powering up faster
---
Pay to win are in game advantages that will be afforded to players that pay but not to ones that do not.   How is repairing gear and weapons without the materials required at an instant, not pay to win?   Granted it's not a huge one but it is one.   Plus they have stated that more are on the way.  Defend it all you want, it will just get worse. 
---
So you have the inside track on their financials?
---
No?
---
Fuck off then.
---
You've gone from "It's not pay to win." To...
---
"It is pay to win but it's okay because it's a small advantage only." 
---
The benches are irrelevant in the situations I'm talking about too. 
---
On my wAy
---
Lol that's a little dramatic I think,but you go.Im sure Bethesda appreciates your unwavering support.Its pretty clear his wasn't a highly requested feature and was only chosen for its ability to be monetized.
---
Re-logging didn't seem to work for us the other night.
---
Also, to be clear, if my friend went and found 2 or 3 TDs himself in the bunker, he could turn them all in (fast traveling back and forth and handing them in one at a time). But when I had 9 or so and would hand it over 1 at a time at Camp Venture, only the first would trigger the quest. 
---
No so obvious when new to the game and have an opportunity to purchase in a store for example.
---
Just today I saw a guy scavenging Aluminum cans out of a trashcan. It was surreal.
---
That’s a really good idea. Maybe if you take your beer out of the fermenter too soon, you get a bottle bomb!
---
Joining now
---
Yes I have 5 pieces. I've done some research on my own and through online searches and it seems the chameleon armor "blend in the environment while sneaking" stacks with each armor piece 
---
Jeez, those are insane load times. I have dual nVME SSDs, and I load in about 30 seconds. I had no idea it was this bad for other systems. 
---
I've been playing since vault 13 in the 90's
---
Maybe in the Fallout timeline he wrote the book *Buckethead...* 🤔
---
Okay chicken littlw
---
Stop it guys. Stop complaining, Todd Howard has a right to your money. You are being crazy.
---
" While you play Fallout 76, you’ll earn a currency called Atoms by completing various gameplay challenges and achievements."
---
Do repair kits give you any bonuses to SPECIAL? Any damage increase? 
---
It repairs your armor and weapon. 
---
Wow. So game breaking.
---
*"But wait you can get bonuses by using perks and repairing at a station"*
---
They have not passed the line. 
---
Passing the line is putting an actual ITEM FOR SALE THAT WILL GIVE A TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT BUFF.
---
Shit. My chest broke do I go back to camp and repair it or use a kit on my chest and go back when a leg breaks. 
---
It really does not give you a single fucking bonus unless you are unprepared for combat.
---
If that’s how people handle silence, just making up worst-case scenarios, that’s on them.
---
This sub is toxic with this cycle of reading into stuff then *demanding* immediate responses to all queries and concerns.  Haven’t you all learned that it doesn’t work?  Do we have to do this every damn time ITV?
---
What if the camps were stronger and they could only be destroyed with explosives. OR only certain explosive weapon like a fatman or a grenade launcher can destroy a players camp. 
---
tl;dr this is the first step to fully pay-to-win features. And in future games it will be standard.   
---
hahaha, I haven't played since like 1 month after launch. but this is funny. in a non-funny way
---
If you guys ever heard of Runescape 3, you've seen this before. RS is a pay to play/freemium game. You can play for free, or pay a sub fee for a MUCH larger game. But a long while back Microtransactions made its way into the game. It STARTED with a similar freemium system. You get 2 tickets for a daily lottery, you could buy more. Then it expanded later to a cosmetic only store.. and NOW, years after MTX first raped the game, you can pay to get a maxed account (that's an extreme example but it was done and cost nearly $3k USD, took about 1 year of waiting around for special promos, BUT only like... I wanna say less than 70 hours in-game time. that's incredible)
---
Even for adventure mode?  You mean there's no penalty for PVP and no caps?
---
It starts with repair kits but who knows where it will end? Bethesda already has challenges that reward players with legendary loot. Depending on the reaction to this they could make tweeks to the new legendary vendor that includes P2W mechanics. None of the suggestions I have made hurt Bethesda or the player base at all. I just want them to succeed without hurting the consumer.
---
Not the prefix explosive 
---
I want [these armors](https://www.google.com/search?q=fallout+4+eli%27s+armor+compendium+road+warrior&amp;client=ms-android-verizon&amp;hl=en&amp;biw=412&amp;bih=718&amp;tbm=isch&amp;prmd=sivn&amp;source=lnms&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj257acnrrhAhWKhOAKHd5-AuUQ_AUIECgC#imgrc=Cn0Lu-MNaRuK0M) from Elianora's armor compendium tbh.
---
Should be a quest or series of quests to obtain the plan as well as a few to use as you progress. Pretty much the same for the supposed fridge, ammo converter, and any other items akin to them aside from being given other mentioned items.
---
I think the previous commenter means the sale wasn't just a week. I'm pretty sure because I got it for my friend after Black Friday and it went even lower around the holiday season afterwards as well. 
---
Unfortunately I haven't got to play the older ones because i'm not old enough (not an insult) but I've played 3,4,76, and New Vegas
---
Yeah, 30 seconds for my ssd too. Plus the other issues like the snap back on spinner. It was anoyying fast traveling. I'm pretty sure this will make my experience 10 times better. 
---
That doesn’t mean you own them.
---
Lol.  I could tell when you responded to my sarcastic post ( you do understand sarcasm don't you) and immediately attacked my intelligence that you don't like to be criticized. At all. By anyone. I assumed that from your original post, which by the way, was incredibly condescending and completely insulting. That's why I trolled you on it.  It actually didn't take long for me to reply to you, but I figured you needed a comprehensive reply to your once again, condescending reply, since you are obviously intelligent and arrogant and can automatically discern a person's motives from 2 sentences. i wish I was that smart!  Oooooh, I really do. Alas, I was at my work and just didn't have time to craft a quick rebuttal.  Again, I am embarrassed not to meet your obviously high standards on timely communication response.  Oh, by the way, if you are at any way deterred by my vernacular, then I will eschew the obvious!  Wait! You might get a kick out of this!  I actually gave you a thumbs up on your original post.  I just wanted to troll you a bit for your writing style.  Turned out to be more fun than reading endless posts from everyone whining about the Atomic Shop.  I have been thoroughly entertained this day.  Thank you Ma'm!  I play XBOX and my gamertag is Greylord48 if you wanna come kill me.
---
i think renting something should cost 10% of the atom cost and you can only rent 1 thing at a time. buying the item then costs 90% of the total cost if you are renting it. if you switch your rented item and then buy the first one, they charge full price (110% cost to rent then buy)
---
I totally notice clipboards irl because springs.
---
They haven't stated anything other than Repair kits. 
---
Do not pull shit out of your ass to prove your broken ass point.
---
HOW IS REPAIRING AT AN INSTANT PAY TO WIN?
---
Are you saying you are unprepared? 
---
Dude fuck yeah they have some really good pasta based ice creams in Germany! I had spaghetti eis when I was in I believe Herborn
---
&gt;But I think we can all agree that repair kits would be nice editions, just not if they are implemented in as purchased items
---
&gt;I purpose that standard repair kits should be offered both in game and in the store. The ones in the open world would be as rare as stealth boys
---
They had us in the first half not gonna lie.
---
&gt;people aren't missing out entirely by refusing to feed the pay to win model.
---
Being serious they are doing that with the advanced but the problem still is it isn't cosmetic and it would be like if they let you buy stealth boys in the shop sure you can get mark 3s or you could craft your own.
---
$18 deal!
---
Oh okay then yeah . If he get hits on them he will get xp
---
So maybe 10-20 of each type of scrap? Or maybe a list of specific items, like it has to have military duct tape, oil can, etc.?
---
Yea turn in one, you leave they stay, log back in and repeat, it sucks. 
---
Said it once and I’ll say it again. 
---
If you give a mouse a cookie, it’s gonna ask for some milk. 
---
Tip of the iceberg, this is.
---
If one sentence is Tldr, I fear for your reading skills. 
---
Filthy Casuals is a good /r, I don't dispute that. But it tends to be an echo chamber.
---
But a sub-par product deserves the criticism it gets.
---
Although this may be helpful in getting the quest to re-trigger, it unfortunately defeats the purpose of us trying to save a bit of time being able to hand in a bunch without fast traveling back and forth, like you normally have to do when solo. Appreciate the info though and will try out a few things with this info. 
---
I’ve paid 5 k once a long ago 
---
It's not pay to win.
---
You aren't winning anything. You don't get a bonus.
---
It repairs your armor and weapon. If you have trouble doing that after a certain period of time, this isn't your game. Please explain how it is pay to win in PVP and PVE.
---
He went up three levels in just over an hour.

I started playing with 4, got into 3 and nv, and I bought 76 Bec it's a fallout game. I was personally happy with 76, and the only complaint was the atom shop in general, y'now, microtransactions, and the griefing. But all that is basically inevetable with it being multiplayer. I was disappointed at their being no human NPCs, considering the most fun thing to me was adventuring the wastes with my digital friend and hearing what they had to say about things. The discovery of wooby gave me hope for this though.  Ultimately I've stopped playing 76, and returned to my solo, modded games. I'm not the biggest fan of multiplayer, so I'm going to log back into 76 whenever they release solo servers (WHICH THEY PROMISED!!). I truly have hope for this game, just look at no man's sky. 76 is a good game, but it strays so far from the path that fallout had paved in the gaming universe, and I dont know how to feel about that.
---
Pretty rich calling me dramatic after making a post like that, but ok buddy whatever helps you sleep at night. I’ve been extremely critical of aspects of this game, feel free to look through my past posts but that doesn’t mean I can call someone’s BS out when I see it. 
---
Not every great addition to the game will be ones that are upvoted a million times and I find your understanding of that to be humorous but also annoying. A better way to look at it would be to examine how many people on this subreddit complained about item durability and difficulty in finding materials to fix their gear, it was a lot. Even if I don’t agree with them about the difficulty of gathering these materials I do respect Bethesda for listening and responding by introducing game mechanics to help combat this. 
---
But yeah fall back on your “anyone who disagrees with my blind hate towards Bethesda is a fanboy” line, shows some real critical thinking. 
---
Exactly this is the reason why he posted here.
---
Yeah. I was under the impression he didn't get any hits. 
---
I know if you have a squad member with you, he can get loot from enemies but only xp if he gets hits.
---
Todd Howard has a right to your money.
---
Honestly I was talking my game group to check this game out when it comes to Steam later this year.  However, with the "utilities items" being added to cash shop I don't think I will keep playing myself.   If they go through with this, the writing is on the wall that they will go further. Not going to waste my time on something that is just going to try and grab my money at every turn.
---
Or it could show a waning desire to continue as this conversation's contribution to the overall topic gets smaller and smaller with every reply.
---
You could be right, but I smell some serious pride being thrown around and that kind of dissuades people.
---
Op doesn't know what p2w is either.
---
I get what your saying, I make a lot of compromises. I hate the idea of them being in the atomic shop but I feel like they are going to put them in there anyways. This would essentially be the second best scenario
---
I started with 3 back when it was new. I probably played that for close to 1000 hours exploring the entire map.
---
I played New Vegas and I like it a lot though it was probably my least favorite.
---
Fallout 4 was definitely my favorite. I love exploring and there was so much to see there.i was really underwhelmed by the building based DLC since I didn’t really care about building.
---
I enjoy 76 quite a bit, but I’m really casual so getting used to the hunger and thirst and dying against bullet sponge creatures is new to me. I’m looking forward to the new content because I love side quests. I think the events could be a lot more fun if more people get involved. If I don’t see someone at an event I don’t normally bother going.

Not my album, but this person is a god. 
---
Also free advertising. Could see myself buying something after seeing someone wear it cuz now I know what it looks like.
---
There are also power armor jet packs, with their benefits and limitations. 
---
It would be great to add other ways to jump, but I don't see a problem with people having fun. 
---
Well that's unfortunate. Server hopping/re-logging just seems to be their way of grinding/farming rare loot. 
---
That's why I asked. I've had friends add me to a team during UF, probably bc I use a TSE. I always try to let everyone get a shot or two. I mostly wondered about the xp. Thanks for replying. 
---
The best piece of advice I can give you is, Have tried turning it on and off again.
---
Actually do you have lead or steal I'll so it for some bulk of both....
---
I discovered bethesda games when i became a widow and they helped me a lot, i'll always have fond memories of FO 3, NV and oblivion.
---
Well, now I'm confused, does spawning your CAMP in a blast zone now just automatically destroy it? It's happened twice in the last few hours and I'm wondering if that was a change or something? I guess I'll have to go find a new plot if so! :)
---
What system? I'm also keen on scavenging lol
---
Yo chill
---
Not my album. This person is a god. 
---
I would as I too am on PS4 but I can't play it 
---
Actually I have perfect internet and I still lag try doing the fashnacht parade with balloons everywhere or try fighting a scorchbeast queen
---
Believe me if they put them in I'll be sad but won't quit or cry over it. However i still have faith in them and the game who knows maybe this moves comes from up high or something and maybe if we make enough noise we can wake them up from their stupor 
---
It was stupid OP for a survival game. I probably repaired my armor once every week with that perk and that was before my armor even broke. People love their conspiracy theories tho and if you try to lay the truth out in the light they downvote you to hell. 
---
Samsung T5 sound good for this purpose for Xbox One X?
---
Are you sure TSE weapons are the problem you are having? Not anti-armor explosive or bloodied explosive? Is the duping issue crippling survival? Is this real?
---
I'm on PS4 I just can't play it 
---
I can't say I play the games now exactly the same way as I used to. Back then I would just get the ebony blade and go on guard killing massacres. Not the most sophisticated play style, but it was fun
---
Case in point i was at 3 upvotes before you brought me back here. I love this game but this community real is as ravenous as the NV die hards
---
First played Fallout 1 when I found the demo on one of those demo cd's with like 30 games on it. I think this was in '97 or '98.
---
Short time later I found the game, it even came in one of those big cardboard boxes.
---
Bought Fallout 2 a couple years after that, and then Fallout Tactics. 
---
In 2009 I got a PS3 for my birthday and immediately bought Fallout 3 to go with it.
---
Got New Vegas in 2011 as a Christmas gift from my girlfriend.
---
I think I got Fallout 4 in 2016 and last year for my birthday I got 76, which was 2 weeks after it came out.
---
I was born in '86 so I can proudly say I've been playing Fallout for 2/3 of my life. 
---
Also its easy to get atoms, i can get 100 a day without even looking at the challange board
---
Sheeeeit why not bud?
---
ill be on midnight EST
---
but then around 5pm on weekends alllll day from that time on lemme kno
---
3 to here, bought all of them + all DLC.
---
Each has hundreds of hours of play time apiece. Probably why I'm still hunting caps and plans while most people have gotten to endgame and quit in a month.
---
You do realize the better repair kits aren't in the atom shop. Their rewards given in game.
---
maybe for lower levels.  i can't remember when i last had to repair armor.  
---
Me too. Although you wording is harsh.
---
Good idea: Adding repair kits to your game to fix broken weapons and armor on the fly
---
Bad idea: Adding repair kits to your real world money meta shop to give an advantage to those who can pay more not play more
---
Started from the demo disk of a pcgamer magazine.
---
Oh ya, Samsung tends to be high end. 
---
You're arguing two things, and I have trouble comprehending a thinking gamer believing them:
---
1. That because development costs have gone up, namely in graphics and servers, that it's acceptable for developers have to ship less game for $60.
---
2. It's okay for a studio backed by one of the largest publishers to have the same quality of product of early-access, unfinanced, independent developers, and charge more money for it.
---
You’re able to find better repair kits in game and also purchase inferior ones in the atomic shop thru free currency earned in game, it’s not pay to win.
---
One survival or adventure?
---
You had me at armor made from teddy bears.
---
1.  Yes they have, they already stated things like refrigerators and a junk transport are slated.
---
2.  You buy kits and can repair your armor and weapons without mats.  So you can use those mats you saved on upgrading other things like armor and weapons.  You can constantly grind out materials without stopping because you can repair on the spot so you are able to gather more without as much time sunk into finding tables and having the mats on hand.
---
I don't buy kits and I have to use mats to repair my armors and weapons and can't alot those materials for upgrading my other weapons and armor.   I have to stop at tables and carry mats for repairs which raises the amount of time it takes to repair my items and use items found in order to make repairs.  There happy, just gave you a literal pay to win scenario. 
---
this shouldn't be added as it gives an advantage over other users who might PVP while it isnt common and not a major thing what would stop them from adding new weapons that are exclusive to the atom shop? they could easily make it be OP as fuck compared to a TSE. it would completely fuck over the tentative survival player base  
---
not to mention it breaks their promise about "the atom shop only having cosmetics" and bethesda seems to be addicted to degenerate business practices as of late and we must fight them whenever something like this is suggested 
---
Ugh I crashed when she was about to die. 
---
A catalog both broad and deep would take care of that. The number of people indicating several dozens of items they'd buy at a fair price is extensive. 
---
Your points are valid and enlightening. Sad to see they've decided to go with their current approach. 
---
it’s almost as if fallout 76 was a shitty corporate cashgrab and they’ll keep squeezing every last cent out of its userbase until the game finally dies and they’ll announce Fallout Origins or some shit
---
I actually kind of liked the emptiness. It's just you, the endless sand and whatever is at the other end of your hunting rifle's scope. I thought Fallout 3 and especially 4 were way too dense.
---
Rejoin. The loot is here. 
---
Seems lame anyone would go to that amount of effort .. I still wouldn't move regardless even if they destroyed your camp. Sometimes they try get you to leave. Had a friend in this situation, he messaged them and told them he wasn't leaving, they eventually went and found another session. Just had a wanted player come try his nonsense in my camp. I left before he did any damage, but just blocked and reported him on both my characters, so next he can't see me. Just keep blocking them Eventually these low lives will get the drift they need to play in the survival servers if they want to destroy stuff, I am going to be laughing my ass off when they implement a no camp destroy policy on the adventure servers.
---
They were just getting some good will back with the updates. What the hell
---
Bring back the boots of Springheel Jack! 
---
Wrong franchise I know but same multiverse..
---
With this as the official thread...why are there so many others on the page...all you see are repair kits this and that, and they all say pretty much the same thing. 
---
1 - The idea sucks
---
2 - BGS is breaking their no Pay to Play rule
---
3 - I'm mad, upset, (enter word of choice)
---
\*sigh\*
---
I did but her body has nothing on it unfortunately. 
---
I'm white and my last name is Knight, what do you want?
---
Yeah that would be pretty cool but it would also clutter up the inventories. Maybe if carry weight was boosted along with like quadruple stash
---
Holy Deity 
---
I'm a long time fallout fan but not really playing so much anymore. I blasted through all the content in about 2 weeks and they haven't released any more yet.
---
I understand, okay
---
Has there been a single response from a Bethesda employee in this? If not, clearly an edict has gone out...
---
Usually ghouls always have one or the other regardless of level 
---
Pay to Sit and Play!
---
Where can I find tons of ghouls below like level 30?
---
it's almost like corporations aren't actually your friends and only care about your money, any "promise" from such a party is automatically an empty one because it's a buzzword meant to get you to trust them
---
U can get the crafting recipes at the bunker. And then farm the mats like glowing fungi.
---
Will take the sledgehammer can you add me? BirdJP19
---
there's the fact though that they said they wont be doing ingame benefits in the atomics shop of any kind they said it was only cosmetics   
---
the part about them having issues with the game I can give leniency on some thing but the game shipping on launch was a complete and total clusterfuck of issues that shouldn't have happened
---
anyways there is a subtype of P2W called Pay to advance what if they decided to make it so certain weapons mods can only be obtained in the shop? 
---
I'm level 35. Just did this today. The gun is level 45. Pretty sure it'll be 45 regardless of the players level. 
---
&gt; Because Bethesda knows that the FO76 players who are left will never leave the game. The remaining players are Bethesda’s battered wives.
---
I bought the game on sale months ago for $35. I am still only level 20. As soon as the game is no fun, or when I am required to spend to keep playing at my preferred derpy pace, I will drop it and play another game. 
---
Bethesda needs people like me more than we need them. There are a lot of games to play. 
---
yeah it does the overheal effect on weapons 
---
You have to pace yourself bro.  Don't eat radroach for every meal, don't reach for the lmg each time a radroach jumps  you.  Keeps you in radroach meat and .308 you know.
---
why fix something that isn't broken especially when there are so many broken things that need attention?
---
Bullshit right?
---
So we all forgot about the absolute apocalypse that happened when people data mined possible "loot boxes" that never happened? People need to really stop and think before they overreact. Also these fear mongering YouTubers lying about in game content and their parrot filled comment sections need to be shut down.
---
and the fridges? gonna defend that too ? and the ammo break down? the scrap teleportation? god you people are on your fucking knees asking to get fucked. bethesda better not break its promise on private servers cause im modding all the atom shop shit into the game legal or not.
---
This benefits utility and not how the person plays in a pvp situation. Or so we think. We still dont know exactly how it works. If this were a damage buff I would understand the outrage. But this seems like a pure utility buff and QOL tweak. Less load times and things like that. You act like you know the future. 
---
Reddit is a echo chamber. You are delirious if you think that majority of players use reddit or care about mtx JUST because a post on Reddit got a lot of upvotes. You are using a fallacy, call for the majority without data is always a fallacy. Of course, the same goes for arguments using the silent majority and loud minority for support a point. You don't know what people like or dislike. But you can have opinions. Just don't use other people thinking as a reason.
---
I agree, but you die far too fast right now
---
What system are you?
---
Whitesprings. After a couple runs you’ll have more than enough.
---
And weighs a ton
---
If the quest says craft X and X is one of the beers that was in the game prior to brewing you can just find one in the world or at a vendor and that counts for Biv's quests. Cause pickaxe pilsner is insane to brew.
---
I also took a picture of this little guy 😂
---
PS4
---
Good to know
---
If ur on Xbox I can give you a radaway recipe. 
---
Damn, would've handed off some on Xb1 :/
---
But you’re still playing 
---
The Whitesprings ghouls body me I’m only level 27
---
How do u glitch?
---
Its ok
---
With the chemist perk u get 2 radaways for 3 fungi
---
Still need them?
---
If its regarding bans thats prob why they dont answer, dont think they have an idea of when the unban will occur
---
consider this there is evidence to support the fact that bethesda might start nerfing certain things to make the atomic shop items more useful for example white knight was nerfed not too long ago and they have made food spoil quicker to allow fridges to be of more value  
---
if this goes through they will also lose quite a few players in the shitshow that theyll create and the total revenue will go down  
---
i wont be spending any more atoms until they tell us that they won't be adding repair kits into the atomic shop
---
Why take away the thing that people find fun in a game?
---
1. That because development costs have gone up, namely in graphics and servers setup/maintenance, that it's acceptable for developers have to ship less game for $60.
---
2. It's normal for a studio backed by one of the largest publishers to have the same quality of product of early-access, unfinanced, independent developers, and charge more money for it.
---
There's a spectrum to how much a title depends on microtransactions or not, how much a title is multiplayer or not, and how deeply it includes story, mechanics, world interaction ... **or not**. I don't know how universal you think this slide towards more microtransactions and gutted gameplay/world is, but it shouldn't be hard for either of us to think of 10 or so in a minute that haven't succumbed to it.
---
If you think releasing a:
---
&gt; "$60 starter-kit" and feeding you the other bits over time to make that price more palatable
---
Is the only reliable model for developers, you gave a gravely mistaken view of what publishers are still capable of. EA showed the game publishing world that they can get away with lowering development costs, and raking in more cash with microtransactions, but just because that model *can* be more profitable, does *not* mean that traditional models are impossible.
---
its more the factor of ive reached out regarding a different issue with a different game and still didnt get an answer
---
Definitely aae. But you know every weapon this is explosive must be a tse. I played for an hour on survival with a level 10 character. Just stay away from white springs, train stations and enjoy the extra xp
---
Good luck out there, Ad Victorium
---
I’ve definitely noticed a theme when it come to their response time or lack there of. Sometimes it helps to call them out publicly on twitter, I’ll upvote you for visibility but I haven’t seen the community managers post for a while so idk how much good it’ll do tbh.
---
I'll take the sledgehammer.  utchia23.   Wont be on for an hour
---
&gt;My problem is as well that thirst and hunger, at least when I play, increase much faster after the Wild Appalachia release. So food is much more important now and I’m tearing through drinks. The gum helps and so do the perks, but I’d rather not waste slots on those. I have a bad feeling about all of this and the rationale is going to be “you don’t NEED this to win”, but we will move to two tiers of players: ones who buy the upgrades and spend more time completing missions and such and the other tier that spends most of their time foraging for food and supplies. I’m waiting for certain components to become extremely rare such as ballistic fiber which will further force your hand on repair kits. We need to keep an eye out for all of this shadiness...
---
you have 2 types basic that is purchased through the atomic shop and gives you the consumable and advanced ones that are dropped from SBQ and high level dungeons these repair your weapon and overheal its condition bar
---
Sorry already sold it
---
thanks man.
---
Silver for laying out a decent argument!
---
I get the general “limited time, don’t miss it!” thing, that’s a universal retail trope, so I can’t get super worked up about it.
---
Likewise, prices in general WERE kinda exorbitant out of the gate, but it seems like that was a little “let’s see what the market will bear” and never going to be written in stone. The trend for somewhat more reasonable levels just seems like economic forces working as intended.
---
Good read otherwise, hopefully it will be seen by those who have influence over Atom Shop stock and prices...
---
Putting all caps doesn't make you right. In both my quotes Bethesda shows what they (initially) considered the line. Cosmetics only is the right side of it, a big part of this game has been showing that you can look how you want without changing gameplay. Since then they have decided to cross that line into items that influence gameplay.
---
pm sent :)
---
No worries man. I'm camped near the legendary vendor location and I'm just waiting for this to pop up.
---
ITS OK I HAD FUN. /s 
---
Bethesda stated the right side of the line is cosmetics only. SOURCE: The quotes I linked
---
bethesda if you want to please the majority of fallout fans make fallout: new vegas 2
---
I'd spend money too if it is worth it like you said, unless they pull shit like they're doing now.
---
Pharma Farmer for a while plus any ghouls often carry it.
---
&gt;This on top of pay to win repair kits. I think I might be retiring Fallout 76 for good as they seem to be taking things progressively towards a cash shop by progressively tuning mechanics to be annoying just enough to justify purchasing whatever garbage they shill out to us.Here's to hoping elderscrolls 6 doesnt have all these shady microtransactions. I would advise all of you to never spend a penny on these new "mechanics" or "features" as it will only justify and pave the road to further pay to win items."Only cosmetic items" -Bethesda "oh except repair Kits" "and fridges" and anything else people put money into.Sad that my favorite dev slid down such a slippery slope...
---
it went from a max of 90% slower armor decay to 60%
---
Everyones mainly against future implications, if this becomes successful it could lead to more actual pay to win stuff like I hear ESO has  
---
So I said they could limit in PVP, but sure... read it however you want.
---
There is a difference between data mining and Bethesda blog posts. You do realise that right?
---
as much as I love this game this kinda makes me think its a sign that the game has truly begun to die, unfortunately 
---
Okay ive heard the opposite but im definetly not 100% sure which is correct
---
No they’re commies I believe 
---
I would’ve much rather seen this than the legendary system. 
---
Give warframe a try bud. Ninjas play free.
---
Who’s coming with me mann?? 
---
@DCDeacon, @Fallout, @Bethesada on Twitter.  
---
Go.
---
again if they sell this an item with ingame advantages what stops them from selling items that give major advantages? they could sell bobbleheads/magazines in the atomic shop they could also go a different route and start giving major nerfs to mechanics before they release a item like making food spoil much faster and then selling a refrigerator perhaps?
---
How d'you know where it'll be already?
---
Plus not only that but you can't help but wonder if Bethesda didn't implement them because of the shit storm.  Those lunch boxes are in the files so someone took the time to program those in.  Some YouTubers do it for the clicks for sure.  Guys like Juice head legit like playing 76 and he even criticized it sooooo
---
I have thought this for awhile myself. But it should definitely be option n as that is how the run speed from speed demon works.
---
Charleston has lots of low level ghouls. The new gorge bridge. The cabins and ice cream place on either side of the bridge. 
---
Gamertag? And are you on right now? 
---
They will when you stop fucking giving them money.....
---
 Just visited this location for the first time a couple nights ago. There's a door with s keycard I couldn't find but maybe you get it with a quest I don't have. Wonder what they're adding there. 
---
Honestly I missed it at first, and then I remembered how annoying it was to switch ammo types
---
They do actually, kits don't require you to have materials so you can use your materials on upgrading guns and armor which is a permanent effect over players that don't buy kits.  So there ya go
---
Relax buddy. I want to support the free updates and if that means having repair kits in the atomic shop im all for it. 
---
Yeah Blueberry_Blitzz
---
&gt;from *becoming* a mess
---
I lol'd
---
bethesda owns the fallout IP so anything obsidian made for FNV is owned by bethesda
---
Buy caps with real money would be cool
---
Being able to inspect an item in the store is badly needed, I don’t know how that got removed 
---
Having this info included there would be very nice 
---
The fact remains that everyone is loosing their minds about something that isn't finalized. Another big problem is people loosing their shit before they've actually used something. You don't know how it will be implemented or if there will be usage limitations like can't use while engaged in PvP or while in a nuke zone. Get a grip and get a life, and don't forget that all these companies care about is money and if you don't like it don't buy it. Plenty of people love this game and if it's not working out for you you can quit and not try to start a revolution over it.
---
I want a Motorcycle. Ooh! Cool idea. A Motorcycle with a Jet pack!
---
The one that boosts your fusion core duration? I have mine maxed and it’s not a noticeable boost to duration
---
Dont get me wrong im all for the atomic shop and its necessary to add content, there are just better ways to do it. The bundles they are adding are an excellent addition and i see tons of people getting them. Walls, flooring and weapon skins seem to be the most popular so they should continue doing that
---
I'd settle for even more of his amazing dialogue. I can listen to Grahm ramble for hours.
---
So it’s free to do pay to win? That’s not a excuse 
---
Wow, that sucks. Thanks.
---
I started with fallout 3. More of a TES fan, but fallout has always been fun. I'm definitely not an OG fallout 1 &amp; 2 player, though. 
---
That’s when you just ask your friend to kindly die for you, so that you may fight on (after eating him)!
---
I got mine scraping but the had to buy the shadowed haha makes no sense 
---
I am just glad you are still here faithfully dumping on it so we know it is trash. What would we do without you?  Some might ask why you don't move on, but I recognize that you have a sacred duty that few could do and that you take seriously.
---
Thank you.
---
Thank you for being the one guy who knows what I would enjoy.
---
How much for the tse minigun?
---
Just got an Xbox, it came with fo76. But what is it?
---
I’m saying that a lot of that kind of stuff is expected when a game is free to play, a 60 dollar game gets backlash when they decide stuff like repair kits can be sold on the side instead of in the game.
---
Me too
---
It says 1.5k caps
---
could jsut use the ranger armor from the lonesome road DLC and have the insignia for all of FNV factions and FO76s factions
---
Thank you!
---
Seriously?  The only way to get a ton of downvotes is to say something positive.
---
It's level 35?
---
Not all slippery slope arguments are fallacious.
---
Many arguments of the form "If we allow Act A, then Act B may follow" are fallacious slippery slopes because they falsely assume that the logic that allows for A will also allow for B, when it often does not; and/or because they disregard major distinctions between A and B (such that B would be a much more significant line to cross than A). For obvious example, take the "acceptance of gay marriage will lead to acceptance of bestiality" argument, which is fallacious because 1) the underlying logic in favor of gay marriage does *not* also justify bestiality, and 2) the argument completely disregards the innumerable moral distinctions between the two acts (which even those making the argument could surely agree upon in fair weather).
---
However, if the logic that allows for A *does* also allow for B, and/or the distinctions between A and B are relatively minor, then it could be a sound argument.
---
It's fallacious of you to dismiss the argument as fallacious without actually demonstrating why.
---
I think lam71309 overstated his level of certainty, but then again, this is a casual context. Otherwise, I think he's correct to be extremely wary. Bethesda promised only cosmetic items. Desire to optimize returns gave way to a violation of that promise in the form of weapon repair kits -- selling (mostly-exclusive) items that give players a tangible mechanical benefit. We have every reason to believe that the goals that motivated this decision and the logic that justified it will also motivate and justify any number of other exclusive or mostly-exclusive items that give players tangible mechanical benefits -- unless we make our voices heard now and remove that motivation to continue.
---
If you're on PS4 I can help you out I make my own everything so my stock is always pretty good
---
TIL - My favorite perk, white knight, got nerfed.... sad face.
---
I'll see your "remember NV" and raise you a "remember System Shock"
---
I can live with a few days of outrage here because it’s a barometer for overall sentiment. (Not a statistically precise one, mind you, but at least a “I see pitchforks and torches, might wanna get someone involved” type thing)
---
But Oh. My. God. The YouTube shizzstorm is going to surpass “900 hour guy” levels very soon. I dread even looking at the Recommended Videos section...
---
How can i join this?
---
Yes it is
---
Also did it literally turn p2w on the same day I got it?
---
Thanks for the replies peeps. Did another 4 queen fights since posting with same results.
---
Be really nice if Bethesda would tweek the drop rates. I don't mind The Grind in games but this feels more like drudgery. Having the same issue with Census Violence for the shielded lining and Uranium Fever for anything other than 1 star crap armour.
---
Overall I'm really enjoying the game and looking forward to the new content, but the The Grind.
---
Good luck everyone! 
---
Not a start a new war but probably after repair kits are added.The next patch doesn’t seem to have much in it in bug fixes. 
---
I am but someone else has decided to help me out. Thank you!
---
Msg me djd532
---
Lol, 100 day roadmap?  Never seen a more demanding and entitled community.
---
You are being toxic in the same way. I was enjoying the game for a while, but people saying a repair kit is the apocalypse is sad for me. I think is not a issue.
---
Old me was playing Super Mario World for years. The old good &amp; full games. But nowadays you need hundreds of people across continents to make a game. The textures need be done in a third world country just to afford costs. The level of production on games is ludicrous, only can be done with a insane amount of money. People with money only invest if there a high ROI. There are a lot of people in this industry with a crunch issue. But is not just a company or just the videogame sector, it is our capitalist system. We can help acting like fans and healthy consumers. A QoL item with low impact is a good way of support a loved studio.
---
You didn't see the post where that guy found out where it was? You can see in the window and see where the vendors going to stand and stash is well. Berkeley Springs train station.  Bring binoculars
---
Yeah the Atom shop is necessary for the game to keep going.  However, it's a very slippery slope they are playing around offering in game advantages for real money.  They need to stay away from doing that or go free to play if they want to add stuff like that into a cash shop.
---
The game was a success from what Todd Howard said so they can't be hurting from cash if what he stated is to be believed.
---
Should  be saved to your Live account. The only thing that would be stored on your Xbox would be pictures you’d taken. 
---
Hey I'll even give 700 round for it as well
---
Check rifle gamings video on youtube about it
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed under Rule 5 and your post has been removed.
---
And then you have to grind the materials out regardless. 
---
Soon is it really bad? I get enough materials to make ammo, repair armor and guns just by doing watoga loops. 
---
Go to an area with scorch and take their weapons and armor. Plenty of Mats.
---
It's not an issue for anyone in end game to have a problem getting mats. It's really not going to effect anyone unless you are very dumb and engage when you have low CND on weapons and armor. 
---
That's like running into the nukezone without the proper aid and perkcards on. 
---
The difference is so minor because someone will still need to grind out materials.
---
If it comes down to a pve event raid, Yeah I want everyone to have repair kits or backup armor if they come to close to even needing those. 
---
But it's not. The materials you need to repair an item are so cheap with the right perks that it makes 0 sense for anyone to buy them unless they plan on grinding the next day.
---
this post referred to a cosmetic armor not an armor with any stats
---
I feel you man. I was in a nuke zone at Whitesprings, my rad meter went nuts and started increasing rapidly without reason. Dropped rad-x like water. I WAS 85% health but it wouldn’t stop till I died. I had been farming since the start, was a few hours in and had crazy flux and some legendaries. I ran back for the bag....
---
[I looked down to grab it, and then.....](https://imgur.com/a/uS54JTz) 
---
When I restarted I had even lost the newly acquired legendaries. Shit. 
---
They could!  Time to uninstall the game, huh?  So what are you switching to?  
---
It only happens to me with piles of wood outside gas stations. 
---
I need to think about it
---
all game data not just in fallout 76 can be moved from console to console as account data like characters is all saved to the online server and not the console
---
I don’t care. I just play. 
---
Awesome, and thank you for the super quick response! 
---
Hope that helps! 
---
No I had not, but cool beans
---
Well give your answer soon cuz it might be gone
---
Thanks
---
My friend was able to walk around naked in a blast zone. 
---
But we found out he had nearly 4x the rads as it took him 45 seconds in my special shower to get the rads or about 4 health bars of max rads.
---
Probably won’t do any good cause of all the people who take it upon themselves to downvote anyone who needs help, classic! If it has to do with being banned then it seems as tho you just have to wait for a response from Bethesda, I honestly doubt they’ll ever fix duping so I’m not sure if you’ll get your account back. Hate to say it like that but it seems to be the case just based on how they built the game.
---
the Ranger Armor Mod from F4 that OP directly referred to is Armor with actual resistances and not just cosmetic.
---
His Edit that he only means a cosmetic ranger armor came after i commented.
---
ah
---
If you need fusion cores, kill sentry bots.
---
I wish I could spare some but I only have 3.
---
Are you using a Sony Bravia TV? Those haven’t been working pretty much from day 1 as far as I can tell.
---
Soap now spoils!
---
Will take a trade? lvl 40 Bloodied Harpoon gun 3*.. Improved bash and agility
---
if you want some recommendations there is doom 2016, wolfenstein the old blood,high noon drifter + strange aeons on GZDOOM ,Rainbow six Seige,terraria ,ion maiden ,Dusk ,Amid evil, unfortunate spacemen.
---
Hey that's an insane price. I'll sell you 2 for 50 caps each. Gt watchmefly420 
---
No one has been willing to let me look at their equipment so I can't know for sure.  I have 3 ranks of fireproof, Serendipity, and now dodgy.  I don't lose every firefight, and I don't always get oneshotted.
---
All I know is that sometimes,  I'm walking along and then crackle crackle respawn screen. 
---
I can give you some for free, PSN caf1550. Sadly I won’t be on until later though 
---
i would prefer it as a cosmetic armor so that way its useable at all levels 
---
Thats ok thanks for the tip
---
If you got time find a spot with power Armor and a fusion core and server hop 
---
Haven’t you gotten the hint?  You don’t get to swagger around Reddit demanding the Bethesda folks answer all of your little whine posts on your timeline.
---
Oh yeah good idea. How do I get full ones?
---
that joke'll get funnier the more its used man trust 
---
Let’s be honest, you prefer this.  Or else you’d be playing.
---
Its the factor of me not doing any exploits that irritates me because my email said i was banned for exploiting
---
I'm not saying it's a huge advantage but it is one regardless.  You even started you would like people have them in a raid which is coming soon.  I think this will be a very slippery slope Bethesda is headed down and we could see a lot more I'm the shop that offers larger advantages. 
---
I'm cool with their shop right now, I think the bundles are a good idea and the shop is non intrusive to my experience.   It's a necessary thing that keeps content flowing and keep Bethesda developers employed.   Hell if they decided to go free to play now, so I could move to PC,  I would even be okay with them adding repair kits in but not on a $60 premium title.
---
You sound like a fun person to group with!
---
Illuminati/Communism confirmed
---
No only caps
---
Same been playing for over 10 years it’s not pay to win more like pay for some convenience I spent hours upon hours grinding in both rs2 and rs3 I have no problem if some one wants some xp boost I don’t really care not every one has hours and hours of there life to grind on RuneScape tho they still may enjoy the mechanics the world and gameplay which is what they want more of.
---
I don’t care if some one pays that’s not why I play the game or enjoy it it’s for my personal enjoyment my own achievements if some one wants to buy gold or xp or quality of life items let them because I understand it does not affect me. 
---
and to be frank I think RuneScape would have shut down long ago if it didn’t hav rs3 basically saving the company but there are both version to play seems world of Warcraft is gonna do the same with vanilla 
---
I honestly love rs2 but older now I could never ever go back to it Or god forbid start over I’m so glad rs3 exist much more casual and just more fun less grind iv been there done that multiple max capes and all this went kinda off topic but I just have allot of passion for the game and the player bases are still split and still at war and hate each other don’t know when you last played we need both games is all I’m saying 
---
Don't pull the weapon out to load it. Switch to another and when you switch back it will be loaded. I know it's another Bethesda screw up but there's a work around.
---
Not exactly. The gist of the situation is that Bethesda wants to include repair kits in the atomic shop where you spend money. It's not in reality P2W yet but it's a slippery slope if they go through with it.
---
i would have made the refrigerator should be quest reward much like the brewing station and fermenter
---
Well this is why i carry 4 rifles for lol
---
That's not pay to win. In any sense. It is a QoL item, the same in a lot of MORPGs. And the atoms can be acquired in game. The outrage is ludicrous.
---
You used plastic to bulk your junk. That’s what saved the weight. Then you went to a workbench while you were carrying it, scrapped all and unbulked it, losing your plastic. 
---
It’s unclear if that’s a bug or an intended thing—the scrapping part, but—bulking is for selling, not for weight reduction. 
---
to avoid copyright on the red ryder bb gun they could call it a crimson caravan BB gun
---
P2W destroyed star wars battlefront 2s launch. It would have destroyed the game if they didnt remove it. Maybe it would have better player numbers now if P2W was never the case. I think P2W is a serious concern. Its not healthy for a game and could seriously damage it.
---
umm its literally in the post repair kits  then fridges then ammo break down and after that scrap teleporting sooo how is that not pay to win scrub.
---
Geez, you don’t actually expect a tenth of that, do you?  Man, everyone’s asking for moon shots around here.
---
Me? I am on playstation
---
Okay, sorry I'll pass on it. Thank you anyway though
---
Basic are just a 100% repair and Improved are 150% and are going to be loot drops but you can just use a perk card to get to 200% repair which already outclasses the repair kits. You also have an entire C.A.M.P in your back pocket to whip out and repair EVERYTHING.
---
They should add in sunset sasparilla by itself
---
Shout out to anyone who thought twice about reading past “seperate” but continued on and found a well structured point. 
---
That is not expected when a game is free to play no game should be outright pay to win.
---
Free is not a excuse hell one guy said adding new characters in a game is pay to win it’s technically paying for a advantage DMC is also pay to win then every fighting game is pay to win any dlc is pay to win the list goes on we need to stop calling stuff pay to win when it’s not even close 
---
It is my game. You are being quite ignorant. Think about it for a minute. If you pay money, you get more sustainable combat and won't have to visit workbenches. 
---
If we are fighting PvP imagine, both our main weapons are low. Both break. The person who spent real money can now repair their main weapon and the other can't. That's an advantage dude. A paid for advantage. Same in PvE. You get longer time between maintenance and can repair on the fly if you pay. Many advantages.
---
i would prefer they add pets like dogmeat/the automatons DLC but have skins in the atom shop for them you could have different breeds of dogs like dalmatians,pitbulls ETC ETC 
---
Not really my style.  I like exploring and building games, ideally with a prosocisl co-op feel.
---
He also mentions having a home and a stash somewhere. I personally think there's going to be more to his story in updates down the road
---
Hey. I’ll buy the LMG. What’s your gamertag?
---
I would like the Chinese stealth suits from fallout 3
---
There's dozens of other threads, let people discuss other things. 
---
If they put fridges in the atomic shop then I don’t think that I will buy ES6.
---
Some very odd glitches on this one, even for Fallout.
---
Nothing really new in terms of content. Games better overall but if you stopped before just keep waiting until the vaults unlock or other larger content drop.
---
i can understand then i prefer first person shooters generally terraria is the closest to that on my list though with its building mechanics,and gunplay (especially with terraria overhaul), 
---
Replace “like” with “because”
---
But the atoms can be acquired in game. And the repair kits are close to useless. A better version will be a drop and would be craftable. Is just a QoL thing. I am just saying. The game is enjoyable. I don't get all the salt.
---
Please and thank you, the game says I am using the TSE one on my favorite wheel, but it makes me equip this one. GT same as reddit name.
---
I was dusting and thought to myself, I need to scrap these!
---
https://1drv.ms/u/s!Aq5RrSAqheoSlYIxtYQ2ERBGQ-UNCw
---
“This company where nobody knows (or cares) that I exist isn’t catering to me! Everyone pay attention to me and validate my bullshit!”
---
Blah blah blah. Gtfo child. 
---
Then hurry up and go quit and break your disc in half and unsub from here what are you waiting for they lied to you booo hooo 
---
I stopped picking it up.  See one prefer much every time I go looking for my deathclaw gauntlet.
---
Yeah, but there's no story really.
---
If its any clothing u can find laying  around it's not rare
---
It’s normally a common drop from watoga antique store same with the fatigues
---
Not super duper rare. I found one on a random spawn chance at Appalachia Antiques in the Cranberry Bog.
---
adventure.  survival is not my cup of tea and, frankly, i forgot about it.
---
Oh god noooo. Well it did work very well for weight reduction so why not 
---
I know, I can you give some Cores. Add my PSN and when I’m on I can get you them. 
---
That’s where I found both of those too. This was my first time seeing the lab coat and I saw someone on Facebook looking to buy so I thought it might be semi rare. 
---
Is not pay to win. It is just a QoL item. A better version will be a drop and could be craftable. If you are interested check the data yourself. Don't listen the outrage on reddit. Check for yourself if the game is good or not for you.
---
*And didn't listen to any of the cries of not allowing crossing over characters.
---
i could drop you a few, i probably have way too many and they’re taking up hella space. And you could go to places like Blackwater Mine or the Eastern Regional Penitentiary because they usually have power armour frames there. my psn is fayries if you wanna join on me and i’ll drop you a few
---
Are
---
Seems like they're trying to get away with the microtransaction plan they had made for a game that wasnt complete garbage.
---
lol
---
I've seen rumors of refrigeration coming but yet to have seen that it will be in the atom shop
---
Id love to test some pvp stuff with a guy who has a full assassin's sentinel set.
---
God no. These morons karma farm on the hint of something they don’t like. We don’t need a month of “oh no day 75 will destroy everything waahhhhh”.
---
This sub is useless for a month everytime the karma farmers come back and the mods do nothing. You want to inflame these idiots even more?
---
Opps sorry forgot my ela teacher was grading me
---
Oh well.
---
I owe you a drink! ( thought this before seeing your name)
---
It was either deselecting the missions and reselecting it or the pump shot gun but it finally popped.
---
5 long day. Thank you thank you
---
They would just use it to doomsay and farm karma anyways.
---
I believe stranler blooms can be harvested at night and pods during the day, or so i have heard but dont have any real evidence that this is the case
---
If I wanna swagger around Reddit wearing your panties I will. I really don’t care if you like it or not. 
---
You mean for atom, right?
---
So I can use the free atom for it? Sure. I could go for that.
---
Great suggestion.
---
- signed in agreement
---
Bulking only reduces weight a small amount, and honestly it only seems to effect stuff like steel. Its more for organizing and selling purposes.
---
Im just saying the bonus from two shot is nothing like it was and I doubt it is one shotting anyone. 
---
I'm talking about the argument that these things are the start to a "slippery slope". Which is almost always a bullshit argument. They announceed that they also want to try a couple of other QoL things that are clearly not okay to win. What are you winning if you can send back some loot to your camp, or keep your food stored for longer, or your weapon repaired from your inventory. These are just convenience items, they don't change how you play the game. 
---
Take a workshop at a power plant. Power the fusion core generator. You get one full core about every 5 minutes. 
---
When server hoping you can occasionally find a full one. 
---
Same here.  Started with Fallout and I've played all of them but Tactics and Brotherhood of Steel.
---
I'm fine with anything that doesn't offer pure stat or gameplay bonuses. 
---
I literally saved 200 lbs just by bulking
---
But Bethesda Pwomised!! I named my firstborn kid after them and this is the thanks I get?!! I’m done, leaving everything behind and moving to West Virginia, yeah that’ll show them.. gotta buy that vault tec bundle tho first.
---
I’m level 19 and my guns break all the time. I play for about 90 minutes a day and I have one gun go down totally at least every other play through. 
---
No one will engage in PVP for over 30 minutes in Fallout m this isn't elder scrolls online where Combat can involve hundreds of players on both sides. It's fucking fallout where for the most part, it's a 4v4. You'd run out of caps before your weapons break. You'd also be ignorant to keep on fighting because you don't know when to disengage. Again not my problem you only have 1 main weapon. If my main weapon breaks, I use the other 3. I swap my perk cards and I'm good to go. 
---
It will take the same time to repair a weapon at your camp. 
---
Haha!
---
You are talking like the majority of players use reddit or YouTube. You know majority of people just play a few hours a week, they don't base their whole persona in a hobby.
---
I've heard northwest of Dyer chemical, glowing buds on the bottom of the trees. Saved a post awhile back but never personally confirmed it.
---
Not sure how you managed that. I have 800 lbs of junk nearly always in box and most I average is 10-20 lbs after bulking. Most junk's weight reduction is negligible.
---
Tbf, they also asked for community input on Survival mode and implemented none of the suggestions the community had.
---
Series fan since the original Fallout.  Was the first or second computer game I bought back in the day for my Mac G3 Powerbook.  There weren't a lot of gaming options though, to be fair, but I got hooked regardless.  I think the only iteration(s) I haven't played were old console exclusive spin-offs.  I have around 1300 hrs racked up in 76 so far.
---
That was quick and easy. Here’s a thread bump. 
---
Again, read the first 2 sentences of THIS chapter-length response and more of the same.  
---
Your "sarcasm" registers as immaturity and pettiness.  So I really cannot absorb much of your repetitive responses.  Sorry guy.  Not interested in this pissing match and only kept replying because you seem lonely (or craving attention).  But yeah. Go play. 
---
Did you happen to re scrap? When bulking it goes into inventory. If you go to a bench it will re scrap any you did not put back 
---
Pretty sure only at night
---
Try changing your audio settings to 'area' - works for me amigo :)
---
You can’t transfer characters between two live accounts. 
---
I don't see the problem. You earn atoms playing the game, so you can buy repair kits from the playing the game. It's not 'pay2win', it's play to win.
---
I appreciate your intentions but it won’t ‘be over’. It’s the same group that spammed about the game being “completely dead” at launch. They just wait for some new excuse to spam. One of the mods participates in the spamming and then they claim it’s for general discourse. 
---
Better to just arm people with the knowledge that the spamming isn’t representative of the community.
---
None of the above, leave my springy legs alone!
---
Oh no that's probably what happened. I didn't think it would go to my inventory. Also i didn't know that i could scrap that. Man that's annoying 
---
Pretty sure I found a home somewhere that's labeled with a name that seems awfully close to Graham.  Would have to look around to find it again.  I was curious if it might be related but didn't try to dig into it any more than that.
---
If this is the problem they could change the money to atom conversion. Let the PA skin cost 1800 atoms, which can take a while to farm in game. But what if 10€, instead of 18€, equal those 1800 atoms? Make paying more attractive than grinding.
---
They could also lower the atoms we earn but that would cause just another outrage.
---
I can see your second point though. They want a steady income and thats difficult to achieve with one time purchases. Consumables are a solution, but most people wouldnt buy cosmetic consumables. Maybe they could sell xp bonuses? I dont see faster leveling as p2w. Or they could come up with their own version of a season pass. Something that would entice people to regularly pay money. 
---
Played 1, 2, tactics, fo3, fo:nv, fo4 and now this. My friends play on console. One of then played the intro to 4, like literally the intro. They don't even know who Garvey is and they lost interest. They play on console. I buy 76 on PC. They all decide to get 76 for ps4. 
---
1 of them played a couple of times and uninstalled it because he couldnt just log on and kill things.
---
2 others were like, "this feels like a pc game..." but then eventually came around. So I am kinda in your shoes. I love the lore and read everything. One of my friends does not care at all about the story...(any main, environmental, any)
---
Yeah well i think i just had everything in my inventory and then scrapped it. Goddamn
---
I've played 3 NV and 4. Love all the games I've played. Fallout is the best.
---
The junk you bulk gets deposited in your inventory from your stash after bulking. If you looked in your stash you’d see 200lbs of free space but that’s because it’s all on your person. After hitting the scrap all button at a workbench you probably went and stored all junk and now you don’t have the extra space anymore.
---
I have been playing fallout since the very first one. I bought 76 because it was a fallout game. 
---
Personally I love the PvP and love the idea of a fallout PvP. I just wish it was a little smoother.
---
I won't shoot them on sight, but I also won't travel with them or tolerate their presence. I've seen more than one ghoul turn feral. It isn't worth the risk. I sympathize with their plight, but ultimately the safety of the Brotherhood comes first.
---
Oh. It happens... Part of being human is to make mistakes. I've done similar
---
If I see I'm I'll just give them to you
---
I've been playing fallout games since 1.  I like some of bethesda's changes, but...a lot of them, not so much, it's  a never-ending downward spiral towards "FPS" and away from "RPG", but the environments are usually well crafted and the gameplay is satisfying, even if it's not as great on the story telling as it used to be.  
---
Also, why the fuck are you running with a squad like that if you're not into that life?
---
What statistics do you have to back this up? 
---
I guess I’m in the 10%
---
Got the plans for 850. Can jump on now if you're interested. 
---
I loved tactics. I thought the game was too easy though. I fixed that problem by playing each mission with a max of 3 characters. Made it a little harder.
---
Can someone please explain to me what the big deal about repair kits being sold is? 
---
How is this game breaking, or affecting others? I ask because I’m not as knowledgeable about the game as I’d like to be. 
---
I don’t even know what a repair kit is. 
---
The community in game is pretty great, it’s just the reddit bethesda/fallout subs. They’re poorly managed. Topics that contribute nothing new should be condensed but they can’t karma farm that way so the mods use a bullshit excuse about waiting 24 hours.  
---
The only upside is no matter how much they spam Bethesda has yet to actually implament anything based on their spam.
---
That would be awesome
---
The community is so much more mature when they are in game and not on the sub-reddit. Upvoted.
---
It took me a bit to get into NV too. I think for me though, it's because it takes place in the desert. I live in it. I didn't feel like I was discovering anything. Felt more like I should just go outside. I walked away from it and came back when all the DLC was released and realized how wrong I was.
---
Don't lie to me. Just because you don't consider it P2W doesn't mean it isn't. It also doesn't matter if the currency can be acquired in game. A boost is a boost. This is also just the stepping stone for more shit to come. It has to be stopped now.
---
Their reputation was already tarnished when 76 released in the state it did
---
Reddit name is my username...sold
---
Thanks I will look into that
---
Great idea :)
---
Modern/clean furniture, floors, walls. A player made a mod for fallout 4 that let the player paint over walls and floors with different modern variations. [(Alternate Settlements)](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/5118/). Sell each variation, people would buy in. 
---
Also, let us display items. I want an unrealistically beautifully preserved lived-in looking house. 
---
True, although it felt like the last few missions there was a huge jump in difficulty. I got the impression most folks lost interest before that point. 
---
That's where they show up for quest but not having luck after quest completed
---
Hopping on now. Jay_31_
---
Pretty sure they don’t work.
---
Thanks, I'll try this 
---
Why prepare for downvotes? no one hates the idea of repair kits, we hate the idea of them in the atom shop, violating the VP of the companies promise on this subject. I actually rather like your suggestion... even if they aren't craftable, being able to grind up a couple for emergencies wouldn't suck.   
---
As a challenge reward, it'ed be great, or have a repair-bot offer you a daily quest, something alone that line? that'ed be swell.
---
I use a ssd on ps4 and always load into everything faster then my friends.  They can fast travel first and then I’ll fast travel on them and still beat them to the destination.  
---
I just wish I could find Graham period. Been playing since beta and have not seen him once 
---
Gotta go hit that event now brb
---
Got me good with that one
---
Not much at the moment, but I'm thinking long term with mine. I am keeping them and then going to sell them for 500 caps each next month. They will be worth a bunch later down the road, you just have to hold on them a bit longer.
---
It's not a rumor when it's from the company. 
---
I see. Well update if you find a spot cause I'd still like to know.
---
On PC, they worth 300 caps, but most people just give them away.
---
Some mysteries are best left unsolved!
---
But really though, I'm pretty sure that its classified as EXOTIC
---
Give it time it could be worth a pretty penny 
---
And it happens where most people now are bloodied. Just happened to me again. They should die in one shot, but this stupid nerf makes them survive a hit 
---
I'm mostly holding judgement until I see where it goes. I'd rather pay for content updates. The funny thing is for the past month this forum has been thrilled and jolly and having a great time with the game. People had been literally posting they had purchased atom points with real cash for the first time to support the game. If it's buying a plan for them for 500 atom points fine. If it's 50pts per kit I don't like it.
---
i remember, i had to upgrade to 2mb graphics card to run second fallout, fo1 required a bit less.
---
I would try to hold on to them till player vending and sell em for some caps. There will be new players curious about the new content so I'm sure they would have missed the festival. Also try one of the subreddit markets if you dont wann wait till may. If anything else just give em out to new players, dont think scrapping even gives much.
---
Can I have all your stuff then?
---
Thanks everyone I know the extra Berets are worth something along with the plans so I'm holding off on those
---
It's just my opinion. But it doesn't HAS to be stopped now. This can't be a priority in any life. It is just a game bro. People who based their entire persona in a hobby. It definitely has to be stopped now.
---
I have only see  him twice
---
Well, I think all non legendary explosive weapons are BIG. 
---
Legendary explosive weapons are whatever the weapon is normally, but will benefit from perks that boost explosive things in general, like Explosives Expert perk.
---
This IS our feedback.  How did they think we would react when they said since the beginning the AS would be cosmetic-only then go “hey, by the way, now selling item repair kits!” ?
---
It’s probably just a test to see how much they think we’ll tolerate on a slow push towards a P2W model.  if this sticks, we’ll eventually see new armor types or PA mods in the Atom Shop, Mark my words...
---
Seriously! In new vegas you could find these suckers all around. And idc if you can still find the advanced ones. You went back on your word, Todd Howard you greedy liar.
---
lol - of course you don't know.
---
I sure will. I have seen that people say as long as you do not complete quest by making the rad shield they will continue to spawn. I completed it so now they dont appear. Hope it is something that can be fixed. Otherwise have a team member collect but never complete....
---
Talk to us again when you finish school.
---
Try when heart of the swamp is up. People claim when the event is running the stanglers bloom. Dont do the event just get to the river by dyer and harvest. Server hopping can speed uo the process on finding them too.
---
No I realise that ... same live account but moving it to a new console later. 
---
The sadder part is that if you criticized their monetization when the lunchbox fiasco leaked, you were downvoted to hell by rabid fans convinced that criticizing potential pay to win schemes made you a hater. Kinda like the No NPCs argument. Or the lacking faction quests. Or the fact that the engine can't support true PvP.   
---
I stopped trying to convince people here of the potential for worst-case scenarios. I can just sit and wait for them to happen at this rate, since the fans won't change it. 
---
I just found out that golf clubs are two handed melee weapons.  I've been playing since BETA and probably put in close to 1000 hours on Fo4 over two playthroughs.
---
Thanks. Will do
---
Not afraid to admit I don't know something.
---
I learned from it too!
---
Lol
---
I used to play Wasteland with my friend in the 6th-7th grade.  Fallout 1 almost made me fail a semester at college.
---
The boom is more noticed but not the damages. 
---
They really need to update the weapon wheel icons so that each type of.thing had a unique icon.
---
Most melee weapons have an icon that will tell you if it's one or two or unarmed, but it's not reliable. 
---
MIRV grenades have a handgun icon for them, like wtf?
---
Hard to believe when every world I go to is only half full. 
---
I think I'm the only one that didn't hate 2.
---
This is exactly what I was looking for, thanks!
---
Well, you can't deny that if it was not for those of us who \*buy\* these games, the game companies would not be in business - at least not in the game making business.  
---
I'm not saying that people who create games have no business thinking they have some right to make what they want, I'm saying that purposefully making aspects of games annoying'/stressful/obnoxious simply to goad "users" into purchasing work around "convenience" Gems/Boosts/Chests/etc. is complete bullshit, absolutely NOT "creative license" - it's barely different than a drug dealer trying to find more addictive drugs to sell, or drugs with higher profit margins like Fentanyl - sure, less people \*die\* because of "Pay To Win", but it's still pretty fucking shitty and shouldn't be tolerated in any way shape or form and we (who love video games) should absolutely basically every practical thing within our power to thwart this vile plague.
---
For real. How hard is it to make new camp items?? My wallet is ready. Get to work! Make me the cool stuff!
---
I’m surprised you didn’t garble more words than just “reimboursed” with BGS’s dick so far down your throat.
---
Because people are over exaggerating, simple as that. 
---
How much for the vanguard LA and the double or quad crossbow?
---
You need to get am Ultracite Receiver for it. Ultracite rounds craft more ammo than normal 
---
It’s Going to go down as the only Fallout game that I’ve never played.
---
The high jump part of Marsupial is almost as much of a handicap as it is a benefit.  You can't control how high you jump, so you're always launched to the same height.  If you want to do something like jump over the railing at a train station, you have to be careful not to accidentally end up on the roof, and it's definitely going to take longer to do get in there.  In a tense situation where you're trying to get out of reach of an enemy by jumping in a gap or a window like that, you stand a pretty good chance of getting hit or even failing altogether.  It's not all positives, even if you have class freak 3.
---
I never buy a mtx. But the only thing ruining your game is you. 
---
50 dollars is cheap. Capitalism don't work that way. The cost of make games is high. Then the investors wanna a high ROI.
---
In game (and IRL) the most important thing is not the items, enjoying your time is the most important thing.
---
If your advertising is an afterthought, how can you expect anyone to take your product seriously? 
---
Throw me some numbers, but I'd prefer the listed trades.
---
Yes. This would actually make me play in 3rd person. I love this idea!!!
---
How is it a afterthought just because I make the slightest mistake you gotta call me out on it because you want attention 
---
Modern/clean furniture, floors, walls. A player made a mod for fallout 4 that let the player paint over walls and floors with different modern variations. [(Alternate Settlements)](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/5118/). Sell each variation, people would buy in. (Edit: AS was buggy, for reference [Homemaker](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/1478/) was more stable in that the dev cloned vanilla walls, swapped out the textures, and made new keywords.)
---
Sir, don't forget to put on Green Thumb perk when you harvest the blooms. Also, put on Chemist perk and Super Duper when you make Radshields. Lots of Radshields in your inventory!
---
first-gen Fallout fan, representing. to this day, Fallout 2 remains my Favorite Game of All Time. 
---
when my oldest friend (another old-school fallout nerd) and i heard about Fallout 76, we both experienced delight and horror in equal measure. delight, because at last, we could share our exploration with a friend, and share the experience together. horror, because we've gotten to know the Fallout community quite well over the years, and the idea of an entire world populated by them...gives one pause. (go turn off Safe Search and look for "Fallout fan art" if you want a taste of what i mean.)
---
i admit, i was not at all prepared for Fallout PVP. i don't know why, but there ya go. clearly i should have expected more from the Raider community...
---
I know that's how that worked in fo4 wasn't able to find out if it was still the same in fo76. I tried researching and asking around but no one really knew.
---
I was going to go with the aligned mods as I believe those were the lightest options that didn't tank my weapon accuracy.
---
Now that I have more weapon mods I wouldn't mind trying this myself but I was just wondering if you had a source or anything?
---
You motherfuckers are worse than the people in /r/conspiracy 
---
They Nerf everything that becomes Meta or trendy. You guys really gotta experiment or think for yourselves more instead of freaking out like everything is pizzagate.
---
I think the nerfs are a good thing.
---
 It leaves room for other play styles to be viable besides X and Y. If you read the patch notes they highlighted this where they discuss it overperforming. How often do you have to repair your gear? If it's really falling apart on you so often that it's broken constantly.. your doing something wrong. End Game with a decent build and white Knight gear never breaks. The repair kits are for the casual player who doesn't have the time to find mats or doesn't ever see them because they don't server hop and they don't go on this teenie bopper forum to pool ideas like the rest of you sheep. 
---
When the upcoming nerfs to mutations comes out you'll all cry haha
---
It's very much not fun when otherwise great games are ruined by Pay To Win.
---
Sadly I have nothing your looking for. Just 6 whole mr. fuzzy tokens. 
---
I was thinking 1500 for the armour and another 500 for quad?
---
I do not know for adventure mode
---
And when sleeping like irl
---
I liked it when I was little. But tried to watch it again grown. Just didn’t age as well as the other.nothin beats marshmallow man/zuul/gozer as a final boss 
---
If they arent meeting their quotas in the atom shop, fuck it id pay 20 dollars to buy cosmetics to stop the game from going pay to win.
---
A Milford man is neither seen nor heard. 
---
The Gatling gun is the way to go. Insanely high damage, low fire rate and it’s super easy to find and make ammo. Takes a real long time to break too 
---
You can get 2 of them in an open crate on a boat that’s in the junkyard workshop east of Morgantown
---
If you want a mask and your on PC, pm me and I'll give you one, I have a few... 
---
I'll do 1500 for the armor. I don't see quad crossbows hardly ever so I'll pass on 500. This is my last one, I've sold 3.
---
Excellent advice! Thanks!!
---
But think of having those AND a non-PA Jetpack. 
---
I couldn't give two squirts for attention. But frack me for trying to help, right? 
---
WAIT till this atom store thing cools down...the more people that do not start playing now the better...message is clear.
---
I like the game but I have no particular fondness for bethesda.  I just hate incessant whining.  The world is not ending
---
Don't worry, they'll be selling the ammo on the ATOM Store any day now!
---
With Arcade versions for your camp.

I can go up to 800 at best. If it was two star wth good effects I’d go up to 12. 
---
Yeah, how dare we "expect to know what we fucking paid for". 
---
Yeah tbh I'd rather find spoiled food everywhere and never be able to eat
---
Oh I absolutely agree. Most of my friends who have played it never even encountered the mutants with missile launchers /.50 caps, before they lost interest. 
---
I just couldn't stop. I had to get all the special characters and what not.
---
Also this goes far beyond criticism
---
That's true, but you can also buy them, which is the problem.
---
Thank you again jenterland, we'll be dealing with each other again.
---
I’m from WV and I love it. I like it imagine vault 76 is over my hometown. 
---
This is actually the first Bethesda game where our character has no back story set in stone so we're allowed to be whatever we want
---
I remember Talon Company in FO3 and the Gunners in FO4. What do you call yourselves? It'll be handsome to see 16 guys in the same outfit or armors. Nice RP.
---
Where is this?
---
New Vegas is my favorite video game of all time; I've sunk hundreds of hours into 3, NV, and 4.
---
If I'm being honest, I would have preferred 76 to have been a single-player campaign, or some kind of co-op thing rather than what we got, but that doesn't mean I'm not enjoying the hell out of it.
---
Whatever it takes? You should type in all caps, you don’t seem angry enough. That’ll get their attention.
---
I suppose. 1500 and 800. I'm online for another few minutes. Same GT as reddit.
---
Wouldn’t that, you know break lore?
---
You get .308 rounds when crafting an MG42. 100+ each time, I believe.
---
My buddy just pops in super duper, crafts a bunch of guns, gets the rounds for crafting the guns, and then scraps the guns for some resources back.
---
Lol. If civilization ended, would the Northeast kingdom even notice. 
---
(Yeah. I’m originally from VT too)
---
I’d like to see post apocalyptic Shelburne Farms ‘cause try explaining the paddle wheel boat that far inland without context. That place would be weird. 
---
He found a way to cheat
---
On my way. 
---
I mean, you can also stop playing games that transition into these practices.
---
I'm going to stop playing FO76 if this repair kit makes it in. Fuck that noise.
---
No one is new to Fo76, this game isn't even in the top 50 in sales charts. The game is hemorrhaging players. 
---
Yeah. Anu player can enter/exit, but mobs aren't avke to walk in and can't spawn in because of how dense the build is.
---
...No, i don't think the NEK would notice at first. My town was originally swampy, wonder if it would revert to that post bombs.
---
I got 400 hours on this game you really think I come here often, to complain about this game? I love the game and I would like it to stay that way that's why I'm complaining about it. I can't understand people believing they are making the development process better by paying micro transactions this is just beyond me. How is this aiding the game or the community? How is this doing something something for the game? Hell I would even pay for a subscription, but supporting such features is just ridiculous...
---
Trying that now, thank you :)
---
Its a survival game with base building. He built a base that ensures he survives. Plus, how does him staying alive effect anybody else? He is just using the opportunity to get some extra xp being top of the leaderboard doesnt even give you anything.

Caliber is just an indicator of bullet diameter.

You could have a ".50 cal" that hits like a wet rag if it has a small propellant charge(and thus is travelling very slowly).

Particularly since some guns feature a cut down stock but still classify as a rifle. The Laser weapons are a good example since they have a pistol grip, cut down rifle stock, and a full stock variant. 
---
Um... I question the T51b Stats.
---
Helmet (limbs are the same stats): [https://i.imgur.com/syrUDPt.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/syrUDPt.jpg)

Torso: [https://i.imgur.com/ITuCVC1.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/ITuCVC1.jpg)
---
That gives me a total of (at 200%): 562 / 454 / 310
---
So the Surface To Air T51b set, at 200% repair, has bloody awesome DR?  Or am I missing something?  A perk influencing it? 
---
Ok...interesting premise. I'll bite.
---
I live in Wisconsin, so...

Ghouls with actual cheese heads
---
So many more beers...just so many more
---
Something like a brahmin with black and white spots...or a minotaur like brahmin creature.
---
Location...House on the Rock. Look it up. Just the kind of messed up place that belongs in fallout.
---
Location...The Circus World Museum in Baraboo. Would be hella creepy post-apocalyptic. 
---
Sausage Outfits...a la the Sausage Races at Brewer home games.
---
And snow...nothing seems more treacherous to me than radioactive snow. The deeper the snow, the deadlier it is.
---
My two caps worth. 
---
Unlocking new radio stations would be a fucking blast. I'd totally be down to buy new stations, but I think music licensing wouldn't make this worth it for Bethesda.
---
Yeah i realized that now as well. 
---
This game has been p2w ever since people started selling in game gear on ebay. 
---
Actually this would be pretty cool, it’s not a cosmetic per say, but it’s something frivolous that doesn’t really benefit anyone except you waiting on your buddy to get back from the bathroom... thanks Zeta Invaders! 
---
Right, because that's definitely what this is about. Reading comprehension = 0.
---
It's for Ever Upwards ;)
---
I've never been able to hear anyone else either... and yes, I can also see that they are speaking.  
---
I've changed every single audio-related setting several times... and try again after each update. I've never heard another person.  
---
Xbox One X.
---
No, it's more like you have to open the pipboy, scroll to the weapon/armor category, then scroll to the weapon/armor you specifically want to repair, press the INspect button, and then press the repair button. 
---
  
---
Definitely not for PvP, you'd be dead the moment you open up your pipboy, since you're standing still and looking pretty for the shooter.   
---
get it now for 1200 atoms, or wait until it goes on sale for 900! Just don’t wait too long—once the shower goes back in the vault, it’s gone forever! 
---
then they’ll introduce a patch where you have to bathe periodically or youll start accumulating rads
---
But this is not pay to win. And is not a ethic problem. I love videogames. I also love recreative drugs. The keyword is moderation.
---
This is a capitalist system. The things only can be done with a bunch of cash.
---
But we have options. There a lot of good open source games. Love is their fuel. But here you are dealing with a private intelectual property. They aren't not selling 50 GB of 0's and 1's. They're selling a brand. Just like nowadays the music bands don't sell a song, but their name. Ownership of records only was a thing of the last decades of the last century.
---
Mtx are not pay to win itself. And they're not a creative decision but a business model. They still can use it in a creative way, just like Bethesda in this game.
---
I used to settle my C.A.M.P. in a place where 2 yaoguais always spawned directly in the building I created. Decided to move and now I live quietly in peace. You might wanna move to somewhere peaceful, too?
---
How about an X-01 paint that skinned the armor like Frank Horrigans in Fallout 2.
---
I wrote a letter to Bernie Sanders asking him for socialized free atom shop items for all Americans! It's a human right! #matchme

Np. Helped document random magazines and the outfits' spawns too.

I've skipped the transducers on 3 characters. I know that they weren't necessary. Are you sure you looted Taggerdy's body? 
---
Hair. Just more hairstyles. Primped 50s themed hairstyles and Wasteland hairstyles.
---
There is so much goddamn money to be made on hairstyles alone.
---
You don't have to activate all the transponders. You could just gone straight to the glass cavern. 
---
On my main character someone gave me the lab coat..on my alt which I use the most now..I got this..it must have been from here
---
I skipped it all and just looted Traggerdy’s body so maybe you just didn’t see where she was lying? Or maybe the game bugged who knows.

I'm totally a verified dev.  You should message me with this method.   No bamboozle.  Wink.

You believe that a company owes you something. You are irrationally angry because they did not cater to your unearned sense of entitlement. 
---
You are literally acting like a pissed off five year old. 
---
A weapon repair kit isn't pay to win. 
---
This isn't just a lazy-tax. This is an unfair advantage. Whales can select non repair related perks and just stockpile repair kits. This means they have a perk advantage.
---
PC here. I did search the sub for mentions of this, didn't see anything near the top. Thought that was weird, made me feel like I was experiencing an unusual bug, but maybe not.
---
I'm not big on voice chat in most games, but there are times it would be nice.
---
I am ok if refrigerators with cool skins can be purchased for Atoms, just also have regular ones attainable in the in normal play.
---
Also, I will still buy a cool themed fridge without my food spoiling horribly fast, It would be handy to stockpile in one swoop, then adventure and make stop ins for good food.
---
Honesty, with carnivore mutation and whisky I don't even think about needing food or water though.
---
At that point we should be able to fly without the weight of power armor
---
Yep, played all of them either at release or shortly after
---
Get green thumb 5 corn 5 muttfruit and 5 tatos and you know have a glue factory 
---
Here before mods remove because "not enough unique content"
---
I don't know of one particular place that has it more than others, it's just junk scattered throughout Appalachia. The best way to get it is to prepare ahead of time and set yourself up an adhesive farm at your camp.
---
Me- surprise, surprise! I love each one for different reasons. Fallout 1 got me into Baldurs gate and table top WH40k ( couldn't afford it so i painted models and watched). Fallout 2 was just so epic i replayed it more times than i could count. Seeing how i could break it.. could i kill everyone after the game. Tactics was my xcom ( no disrespect to xcom). Fallout tactics was not as deep as the other games but the combat was so amazing an the vehicles were really fun. I skipped brotherhood of steel.  Stopped playing video games for years while playing in bands and partying in my early 20s. Purchased an xbox to play fallout 3. Couldn't believe someone revived it. Best the brakes off that.. all the DLC.. " The Pitt" or "Operation Anchorage" was my fav- i didn't have anything to compare it to besides EverQuest 1 from back in the day so i was happy. New Vegas was disappointing. I won't discuss that here because no one agrees with me. Tried to stream it before  76 came out- had no desire to figure out all the wackiness not the Martin Scorsese jaunt i expected and the fact it felt like a massive fallout  3 DLC so I Sold my Xbox. I was sitting on the couch holding my infant son watching the fallout 4 release trailer my brother sent to me. I remember having goosebumps and chills when nate turns to his Dog. I wanted to be .. there. My brother was a huge fallout fan and was in an accident over Thanksgiving 2 years ago. I didn't own a console at that point because i Gamed on my semi dated PC. I went and got a PS4 and fallout 4 that January. I wanted to see what my brother saw. Go where he went. I felt like i was nate - squaring my shoulders to rebuild the wastes whole looking for something i had lost. The story was cheesy and sure it was buggy, but i had my blue suit with a number on the back; therefore i had a job to do. Each day i went to work, at night i went to work rebuilding boston within the limits of the game. I needed that at that time. It really helped me adjust and say goodbye. Gave me a place to  think about things and have inner dialouges whole rummaging around. Something to loosen up the stress of the day because at night I was playing my Sims version of the wasteland . 
---
Blah blah blah.
---
I played fallout 4 until 76 came out. I will play this one until it closes or another comes out. I consider myself a fallout fan and I am an asshole because I hate that Reddit is somehow influencing development Devs and Most of you I meet in game are just sheep doing whatever everyone else does. It's funny and i don't get it.. but whatever we got survival now so beef can be settled. I've made friends and enemies and I really really dig this game.
---
So fuck youuuuuuuu
---
Plant tatos, corn, and mutfruit at your camp, and build a water purifier. Congratulations! You now have an adhesive farm. Tatos, corn, and mutfruit mixed with purified water make vegetable starch, which breaks down into adhesive. Never run out again. 
---
to be fair that would be a hefty set of scrap
---
Yuh, this thread is full of people trippin
---
It's happened in two different locations though, once in the last location and twice in my current one. All three times the enemy happened to spawn in the room I had the decontamination shower, the most expensive item to fix. My camp is *huge*, for it to always happen in the small room my shower is in seems intentional.
---
Usually I'm not big on voice chat either... but it would be extremely useful in some circumstances.  
---
Grr.
---
Lol , i bet you know all about sales charts ( Interesting term) what did you think of the recent issue of forbes?
---
Soon as I have the mats to do all that I'll get right on it!
---
It's mainly atm so I can fix my laser rifle
---
Shill.

I would love to see Arizona. The sprawling suburbs of Phoenix. Saguaro cactus. Up north mountains with snow. Gold mines, the ok corral. It might be too similar to new Vegas though.

 Go do one violent night, bring explosives and only turn on the jukebox. As the swarms of ghouls cluster up on the jukebox, toss a grenade.

Easily 20+ rad-x radaway and stims each time, plus myriad chems and junk.

Nowadays water is expensive. Maybe in the future the water will be a precious possession. Things are changing, sometimes because greed and sometimes because the times changes.
---
Before the games was way simpler. Nowadays you need hundreds of people around the world to make a game. And they still cost $60!
---
Quit your whining.
---
Xbox! Hopefully you are too. Would love a scavenge partner. We could split the loot 50/50 lol. 
---
I want a place to store ammo... and food.
---
And clothes.  Wardrobe, hat rack.
---
I'd pay real money for that stuff!
---
Same. I didn’t pay for atoms until today, after two days of complaints. I was saving them for something I would want, but I decided to show my support this way too. 
---
Melee is already OP.
---
Fix lasers.
---
Will do very soon!  Thanks guy!
---
Will add this evening!  Thanks!
---
Appreciate it!  Will add this evening or morning.
---
Game is still buggy as shit, I logged for first time in awhile and it’s still balls
---
I read the title to this post and thought, oh sh!t, here it comes...
---
Might want to rethink your use of the word "racial." Perhaps "species" is more accurate. 
---
Seriously?
---
That game is fun. And the stocks of EA were back to normal the next month. And it was not because the release of SWBFII, it was a trend in the industry.
---
I get that. I don't have a place I go for it. Maybe try Morgantown high school. 
---
Trusting the roadmap is speculation.
---
Pretending that they are adding repair kits without the intention of earning money is a whiteknight delusion.

That's pretty odd. My C.A.M.P. is rather small in size and my enemies like to attack the blackberries I planted outside first. How about making a little shack just for the decontamination shower? If the enemies still spawn in the shack, I have to say the shower is haunted:(
---
You need to stop talking out of your ass, since you're going by hearsay.  If you actually played ESO you would know the Crown Store doesn't offer any pay to win items at all, and in fact 90% of it is purely cosmetics, while the other 10% is generic consumables that are INFERIOR to player crafted consumables.  
---
What are you talking about? You are going way too deep. 
---
Lmao a level 80 alien scorchbeast with fridge plans sounds hilarious 
---
I don't think the point people are trying to make is a pvp advantage but if you consider survival mode pvp then yes it's a huge advantage. You don't have to walk to a bench and repair and fast travel is limited. 
---
They will bring them back in bundles. It's called "the sales cycle". Nothing is really gone forever. They reappear in bundles- just like movies and games in real life . The fact that you don't understand this concept before being a presumptious prick leads me to deduce you are part of the "freak out frat" . Joining the mob under the guise of reason but really caring nothing of it. This was a cool little bong water write up you did but yeah. Once you eliminate the discussion about product and prices it has no point.
---
Takeaway is:
---
Products move quicker when they are deemed to be scant.
---
Sales are payroll factors applied to ramp up the customer- dollar situation.
---
Percieved value, rarity and Lisa of factors are at play here. I won't even get into that cause you should get it if not you don't get how retail or merchandising works. 
---
Tl dr
---
I knew you couldn't read. Scroll back up there chumpy.
---
Yeah, but everyone isn’t playing Survival. I only play Adventure, and the servers always have at least 15 people. We’re not playing to win (unless winning at great C.A.M.P.s ala r/fallout76settlements. I want more cosmetic stuff for my base AND things like repair kits for when I’m out scavenging and run into a horde of Super Mutants. Why can’t Bethesda cater to other types players? 
---
(I paid for ESO+ too for a while. It was pretty reasonable cost wise, and I never paid to win there either. Just straight PvE.)
---
Correct me if im wrong, but is the unlimited storage offered by paying on eso not pretty pay to win? 
---
Which ones were considered rare again? I 💯 saw players get the gremlin with a hood mask and the skull with a hat on it looking mask on the day the event started. 
---
That would be cool, but I want the standard Fallout 2 X-01, too.
---
I think OP's point was more pointing out the multitude of cosmetic items Beth could release instead of things like repair kits.  Even a tenth of these suggestions would bring in a lot of money, and many already have existing assets from Fo4.
---
Or, you know, you could just hit "r" (on PC).
---
I saw one person get the skull mask the first day of the event. TBH I didn't really like it. I wanted toothy mask real bad but never got it. Just soldiers and owl for me.
---
Who’s pretending that? It’s not me if that what you’re implying..
---
I totally agree about the fridge idea. Would be useful as well as make sense seeing as how we can make fusion generators, wind turbines, all manner of high tech workbenches, laser weapons and (of all things related) cryolators LOL if we can freeze our enemies then we should be able to freeze a brahmin steak LOL
---
As for sending junk to our stash without going to a stash box... not so much. All it would do is lessen the risk involved in PvP events such as contesting or defending workshops &amp; also take some of the challenge out of foraging for materials (we have all done the overencumbered slog at some point or another LMAO). Just my own 2 cents though...
---
Yea I get you, the repair kits arent a huge deal, its just they technically said that the atom shop would always remain cosmetic only, and now that it wont be cosmetic only, people just dont want bethesda to stray too far off and implement actual pay to win stuff, if you get what im saying
---
Remember Ammo benches?
---
I think everyone is holding their breath for info on the Wastelanders DLC.  Seems like they have something big planned and a lot of people are thinking it might be human NPC's but who knows.  Have to wait and see
---
Apparently all they care about is getting as much as they can for as little as it takes.
---
Prime it. Will become a bit better and ammo will be made a bit faster 
---
In New Vegas you just used other weapon same weapon to repair the one you were using. What's being implemented here is a little different than that. 
---
Exactly this.  That repair kit was so lazy it hurts.  
---
Ill throw tou some caps for a beret if youre on ps4.
---
NO THEY'RE NOT TRYING TO MAKE MONEY BEXAAUSE YOU CAN EARN THEM AT THE SAME TIME AS EVERYONE ELSE!! BETHESDA IS THE GOOD GUYS OK? 
---
There is no "unlimited" storage, dipshit.  The only perk resembling that is for crafting mats, subscription members get a bag for them, but they never weighed anything in the first place, plus inventory bag space is earnable ingame.  Seriously, don't talk shit unless you actually did some playing/research
---
LIARS!  Plain and simple.  I barely visit your game anymore and this just gives me one more reason to stay away from the game longer.  Pull your greedy heads out of your butts and remove from the shop and make them craftable.  Horrible consumer practice to push your few remaining players of this crap fest of a game.
---
Everyone's throwing around the slippery slope theory, or the boiling frog idea that before you know it the game will become the P2W cesspool that would make GTAO blush.  
---
Except we can see the temperature dial, we're not going to be blindsided by a dystopian future of MTXs. Once they start messing with my enjoyment of the game to the extent that I feel like using the Atom Shop is the only realistic way to progress, I'll drop this game, but not over some vague promise that based given the game's drop in price and free future content was going to be unrealistic to keep. I'm disappointed, of course. But I'm not going to act like Bethesda was my best friend that I caught beating my dog.
---
I live in Kentucky so a large underground cave Network (Mammoth Cave) would be awesome.  Plus maybe they could do a Hatfield and McCoy faction war kind of thing if they set it in the hills of Kentucky.   
---
Louisville area would be cool too with places like Churchill Downs being a major location.  They could actually add in race betting like the raiders we're doing at the track in 4.
---
not saying buff melee
---
i’m saying give me more options that vary for the two handed perk set
---
faster swinging sword variations, and actual “2 handed” power armor weapon instead of an awkward carpenters hammer in my right hand with the PA on
---
I won't buy these and I'll likely not come back to this game the more stupidity brought into the game.  I don't want P2W crap and you are going back on the promise of cosmetics only.  LIARS!  This doesn't make me want to invest further into Bethesda products.
---
I try to  Brew alcohol as I can and mass craft Ammo for fun haha  I made my own end game 
---
but i do agree with lasers 
---
as well as the pistols 
---
Games used to sell thousands of copies, sometimes only hundreds - now, they sell hundreds of thousands, perhaps even *millions* of copies, and yet, they *still* charge $60 each.
---
That is an almost insane lack of consumer cost reduction with scaling of production.  I can "buy" a song for a dollar, because many other people also buy it.  
---
A LOT of people wanted to buy a new Skyrim game.
---
I bought Witcher III even though I don't play it, just because I wanted to support a company that is against DRM.
---
what system you on and what peice was it?
---
Literally everywhere lol. I have to stop picking it up. 
---
Milk Brahmins. Use your CAMP to kite scorch beasts over white springs. Kill queen after Watoga nuke. Server hop enclave armory until you get an x-01 jet pack.
---
I really hope there isn't some secret way to do it with timers or something and I'm just being ignorant by posting this, btw. :)
---
Damn, while I hope you're not right but I think you are. I ranked up my good with salt perk cause I noticed the almost imperceptible change but it's still spoiling way faster than it should. Microtransactions, while in theory can make gaming fun, can very easily be subverted into pay to play. /sigh
---
I started with Fallout Tactics which i enjoyed at that time. I wasn't reading forums and had no clue people hate it . If i had to choose a favorite i think Fallout 3  would be my choice.
---
Same here.  I go back every couple months to see if they have improved anything.  So far I've not been impressed and now this is sort of putting the nail in the coffin if I ever return at this rate.
---
I’ve played 3, NV, 4, and only recently started 1.
---
I know it’s not a popular opinion, but I hugely enjoyed the Settlement system, and even more so the CAMP system with instruments and friends, and I think CAMPs made me stay.  Wish there was more content, though, like Automatron and contraptions.
---
The earn-able inventory in game takes a fuck ton of gold to actually earn, basically directly pushing you to pay if you want any good amount of space. I know it can be hard to process things as a blind fanboy. Furthermore, is the warden class not pay to win? 
---
Played fallout 1 ,2,3,new vegas,4 and gonna play tactics next
---
Uh no. I used Felicity cause you know this post is from a white kid bitching
---
If they spawn elsewhere, I wouldn't know. 
---
And just when you thought the drama with this game had finally come to a close.  
---
Yes 
---
I’m going to drop another one. Give me 20min
---
Ummmm what?! This may be the zaniest post about repair kits yet and i dont just toss the word zany around.
---
I was pointing towards a players ability to earn atoms to show that it’s not pay to win. Obviously this move is designed to stimulate the atomic shop economy and drive profits but I have no problem with that so long as it’s QOL things and not P2W content. 
---
Havent had the misfortunes to find one yet
---
This would be great
---
PC
---
Vanguard's Raider Left Leg, +1 Endurance, 50% fall damage
---
Nice
---
I think that you're missing the point that most of us know that. 
---
I have one
---
That's a lot of koolaid.
---
Nah!
---
They can do this because most people play games just few hours weekly. People don't base their whole personality in a hobby. They can't see the apocalypse happening right now because they would need stay on reddit or YouTube the whole day.
---
This is a creative industry. Their product is not a game, is the brand. The same way for a music band. The quality of their music is not directly related to the quality of their merchandise.
---
I'm all for love projects. The open source community has very good games. But this is private IP. They can use whatever business model they want. You can't say it is wrong, I can't say it's fine. The market will have the last word, and nobody knows what it is.
---
I play the game because it is fun, I don't have another reason.
---
Yes but that pulls up an empty weapon then you hit r again to load it. For some reason when you log in your active weapon is empty. If you switch weapons when you come back to the original weapon it magically reloads.
---
yeah so once you're past a point the hippocratic oaths kinda just. well guidelines more than rules, per se.
---
# reactive plates .  return 50% of the damage At least if you die, you take someone with you 
---
Your link is broken.
---
Yes, they are that common. Dupers made 25 billion guns. That's enough for every player to have 100.
---
i’m trying to not die
---
You forgot purified water. 
---
Take those ingredients and make vegetable starch. Then scrap that for adhesive. It’s slow but it works. 
---
It’ll also give you more fertilizer than you know what to do with unless you leave everything on the plant. 
---
I'm from Nebraska, so it would be cornfield after cornfield for the East, the West would be like the panhandle. Since it isn't as big a state it likely didn't get bombed much, I'd guess only Omaha and Lincoln got bombed, so that would be the high level area. And since it's in between the East and West coast there will likely be people traveling through, and they build up a large city in Grand Island (middle of Nebraska just off the interstate). 
---
Well, by this logic, who cares, game is dead anyway.
---
I'm interested in a sbq fight, sounds fun! PSN squintmanatee42 level 92 at the moment
---
Why do you all continue to play this trash? I keep checking this board periodically to see if they're making any forward progress, and instead they get scummier with each update. How do you hold out hope?
---
Especially if your patient is screaming whilst a giant mosquito is attacking them. Kinda goes out the window. 
---
Any chance someone can help me tell which files I should remove to undo the mods I installed months ago - I keep getting:  
---
"LOOKUP FAILED!" errors in several different places in the game/various user interface areas...
---
Do you know how to undo that without deleting and re-downloading the whole thing?
---
Damn.... might I be able to get some lol/s
---
I just want to be able to scrap or sell ammo. What good are 3000 .38 rounds when I don't have or want a .38?
---
Capitalism!
---
I didn’t get the chance to play that quest. If you’re just going to scrap them anyway, you’re on PS4 and you have multiples, I’d be perfectly happy to take a couple off your hands. 
---
At this point why are you people even surprised? they have been planning putting in microtransactions ever since the beginning. they only care about making large profit margins they don't give a s*** anymore about making a good game
---
I don't think it is, personally. 
---
They're part-way through a "No Man's Sky" turnaround right now.
---
I'd just hate to see them kill that goodwill by charging freemium style microtransactions in a AAA priced game. 
---
I support this post. I support generating awareness. 
---
We need way, way more of these posts going around til the subs are flooded and they see we aren’t dicking around. 
---
An ATM is exactly what we are to them, not valued fanbase or even just a valued customer. They gauged our outrage and cries about the sneaky Unstoppables bullshit, they took an inch and now here comes the mile.. it’s like a nightmare snowball that’s starting to compile and roll along, and the bigger it gets the faster it will keep rolling.
---
Tip of the iceberg, this is. 
---
This works. I have more strangler blooms than I know what to do with
---
They fuck up at every turn majorly and minorly. No man's sky fucked up very majorly once. Not every update.
---
They are still being passed around for sure. Almost every god tier weapon was duped. I never duped in this game but admit to acquiring weapons that were. I'm not gonna let these weapons go to waste and I don't PvP so I'm not a troll with them.
---
I don't think Morgantown HS has a ton, although you can get some vegetable starch in the lockers. You're normally better off with industrial/farming areas. Check all the cabinets and tool chests, not just the surfaces.
---
Ghouls will also drop wonderglue occasionally, so you can run around somewhere like Morgantown with a throwaway weapon.
---
I've also been repairing my rifles way more often than pre-patch. Anyone else noticed or is this just in my head? :-)
---
They are trying to use new content to cover their failure to fix problems with the game. Like disappearing inventory items for one. There's more but why bother making a list everyone is probably tired of seeing.
---
Thank you! I'm on ps4 as skellyassassin. Drop in anytime! 
---
None at all. For those that work long hours and have families, it lets them keep up with the dimwits that spend all day on the game and think everybody should put in as much time as them.
---
You show me TSE legendaries you can buy with cash and I’ll be annoyed. A repair kit, though? Seriously. Who gives a fuck. Not that big of a deal. Its QoL. Not imba.
---
Yeah, he says that a smartie told him to be safe. "Safe, like a locked up thing with goodies inside." And that's apparently why he trades.
---
plataform ?
---
Also this will probably sound kinda noob ish but some people are also invisible and jumping high, is that also a new thing or?
---
A lack of serious bug's would be nice.
---
Radstag Musk, it's got what wasteland women crave since 2077
---
Platform and name might help.
---
Up until Repair Kits Wild Appalachia was a huge success. That's part of what I am frustrated about. They were making progress! Fixing bugs! Squashing exploits! New content!
---
....and now we're trying to milk the player base with the worst of GaaS structures. 
---
I don't think all is lost though, if the larger community attitude is "No, fuck that", it's good. 
---
Fallout 76 can live on cosmetics. 
---
Hair. Allll the Hair Styles. All of em.
---
Buzz brain was my favorite once I realized what that FUCKIN NOISE was and that I wasn't going completely insane. 
---
Hewwo
---
You can buy atoms, thus avoiding the playing
---
Sorry guys. PS4
---
I really like this game. I hope it sticks around and that Bethesda continues to make improvements and adding awesome new stuff to it. 
---
The game’s far from perfect but Bethesda doesn’t owe me anything at all. 
---
That's a big twinkie.
---
I still run into lots of toxicity, and BS.
---
I hate the setup of the game, but enjoy the co-op.
---
that was exacly the reason for this topic to give them options....
---
Try saying something useful. At least the poster had something useful to conment.
---
Is someone saying we do?
---
It doesn't matter. They got all the suckers they been looking for. Everyone else has left the game for the thousands of other better games out there. The only people left are the ones who make bitch about how they get treated but have proven they will still support the game.
---
No one respects or cares about what people with no standards. If you cannot walk away then your bitching doesn't matter. You can complain all you want but if you are still playing this game; if you are using the atomic shop then you don't have any weight. Words don't mean much; actions do. If you "boycott" for a week -- that doesn't do much either. 
---
So at this point, either shut up and accept being screwed over or get off the pot. There is absolutely no excuse for you to be playing this game when so many other alternatives are out there; no excuse for accepting the abuse. You people do deserve to be treated better but if you don't accept that fact then don't get angry at others who take advantage of you. 
---
Learn to walk away; to have respect for yourself; to have standards or bend over. Those are your options. Bitching and complaining is good... But without action or conviction words don't matter much. Nobody is really scared of thunder -- sure it is loud but it really is just noise; nothing more. 
---
Marsupial mutation with I'm guessing Chameleon Mutation with weightless armor. I think. Probably not that pair but rather stealthboys and secret agent perk.
---
And name? Please 
---
Yeah sounds like they'll be rolling out all sorts of QOL handicaps.
---
I can't believe I paid 60 bucks for this steaming-turd of a game.
---
What is it with company PR nowadays - so many literally have no idea what their community thinks.
---
Commando increases damage for 10mm Smg.
---
I totally did a double take when I saw a pile at work lol
---
Always check vendor notes for plans you want. 
---
I played all the 3D fallouts, 1 &amp; 2 just aren't my style but I've watched MATNs 1 play through and I'm watching his 2 play through now.
---
The lore in Fallout is just so fascinating to me, a world diverged after WWII that encompasses the dreams of the atomic age, as well as the nightmares.
---
I usually avoid all the PVP and events and all that crap and just do the usual Fallout stuff. Can't wait for private servers and especially mods...I know once the mode community gets their hands on this it'll be massively improved and be just as fun to play alone as the other first person Fallout games. It gets a little grind-y at some points though.
---
As someone whos played EA games and ultimate team specifically AND gta online. This is the least money hungry ive seen any publisher. 
---
Maybe if the community got a spine they would listen. But they are completely aware. You people bitch a lot but it doesn't really matter if  you aren't willing to walk. 
---
It's not that they think this will "fly under your radar". It is just that they know you will keep playing and won't walk away or do anything about it. 
---
They got their suckers who will take whatever they give to them. If you want to stop being sucker then stop being angry at them and stop being one.
---
Has a lot to do with the fact that YOU DONT HAVE TO PAY FOR IT. Atoms are piss easy to get. Not everybody has 10 hours a day to game. I’ve said it more times than I can count. This is not a new approach in games THAT ARE SUCCESSFUL. It’s QoL. Guild wars 2 has plenty of it. More people there than here, I’m sure. Nobody whines.
---
Show me TSE in the atom shop and I might be annoyed. But seriously. In adventure mode atleast, nothing is “pay to win”, Because its not a fucking competition. 
---
People keep saying “theyll push and push”. No. Set a limit. My personal limit is things that actually affect a competitive part of a game in someones favor. Thats when its broken. Repair kits simply dont break anything nor are they forced on you. Why is everybody SO damn mad. This game has gotten nothing but flak since day 1 before anybody even touched it. I’ve seen games in worse condition with happier communities. It’s mind-boggling.
---
There is farm on north of nuka cola factory, with material for 100 beers. Get smashed too my friend.
---
Did you tag each one? Would that give you 3 legendary drops?
---
You mean Longneck Lukowski's canned meat products?
---
Mannequins for our clothes
---
Bobblehead display
---
Let us store our magazines in the magazine rack
---
Growing stations 
---
Or i might but them actually.
---
Fire proof perks help with that. Look up pvp perks, a pve build in power armor is a recipe for losing caps and aid.
---
This is a reference to the collapse of the silver bridge in 1967. It was near Christmas and many of those who parished were driving home with gifts, trees, and other festive items. The Ohio river was littered with said items that night. Hence the tree
---
Yeah i agree, its like 1 to 3 shots max on pvp, its not fun to kill or be killed that way imho, welp ... i tried to enjoy the pvp content, but its not for me so im staying on adventure mode which i really enjoy. Cheers.
---
Well with that info it seems like they don’t owe anybody jack and all of this complaining is for nothing.
---
Okay? Then don’t buy it. Problem solved. This was easy. Next.
---
Unfortunately, there are hordes of TSEs out there, and a lot of players with full sets of PvP armor that renders them basically immune to anything but massive damage or rads. That said, power armor has always sorta sucked for PvP work tbh, if you actually want to survive PvP a bunch of decent legendary armor peices will serve you better, especially with the Non-PA usable perks that work very well in PvP. Personally, I sneak around in chamelon armor and gauss people from long range, anyone not in a good amount of asassins / sentinels is dead in two hits, and my friend blasts those people with rads till they shrivel. It works rather well \^\^ 
---
I bought Witcher III, although I can see why is appreciated is not my cup of tea. I use my money in things I liked, I'm not in being a meta consumer. Basically because the corporations have their own agenda, and I could never pretend know what it is. CDPR have a marvelous and costly PR team, a whole country back them, and the studio is formed by thousands of employees. But their games are not fun to me. In fact, I can't believe they have appealing too much people. But it's fine because we need variety.
---
The insane lack of consumer cost reduction with scaling production is the history of Capitalism. Things don't work that way.
---
- best is joining other players doing defend workshop events
---
-next to poseidon powerplant is dried river, inside it is spawn of 10lvl grafton monster
---
-north of nuka cola factory is farm with corn and razorngrain 100each
---
- 2runs in watoga and you have 80robots
---
Same.
---
Currently i am broken, so it is time to fix it. Finaly some space in stash :D
---
I got hooked with fallout 3 and it's been the only series I have to have on launch day.
---
came in late with fallout 3. I just want to play fallout.
---
My guess is ppl are set to "team only" voice, so you see the icons but voices are restricted to them groups.
---
Hit me up this weekend sometime I'll let you choose a few. Name as as user
---
Cool 
---
Nukashine especially
---
We are all now more stupid for having read this 
---
Good call. I just remembered the starch when I was in town low-level farming for plastic. 
---
I think Washington State would be a good one. Lots of woods, large cities, the ocean plenty of space. 
---
" Let's be clear, the true definition of P2W is that you MUST pay to WIN " This viewpoint is \_horse shit\_.   
---
Further, so is your over-all argument. It was stated by the VP of the company that the atom shop would be cosmetics only. Non cosmetic items aren't acceptable. 
---
About to launch. We have a camp set up with stash and stations. Also, nuke will just be outside of Delta so you can use the walkway with very little rads.
---
Funny cuz I've got kids and whenever I give a mouse a cookie he ends up making homemade kites and strawberry jam and playing baseball and shit. Still I guess the same principle applies.
---
Trap doors - because someone's gotta be fed to the deathclaw
---
Been on since Fallout 2 first released. Picked up a copy of one, but never quite fully got in.
---
Was thrilled when 3 finally dropped, even though it was different. Been intrigued by how things have progressed.
---
Wait weapon repair kits!
---
My main is Sert, I name most of my game characters some variant of Sertith. 
---
My scaver alt is Jane Doe. She was attacked fresh out the vault and doesn't remember anything other than that the world has ended and to trust no one. 
---
Almost everyone in my group is a longtime Fallout fan, from 4-20+ years. We're Bethesda have game fans in general.  The majority of us came on with 3 or NV though and have just gone back to play the ISOs in some cases. Anyway, some love '76, some like it, and some it's not for them. All good.
---
We were almost all solo players previously though some have MMO experience but have learned to love playing together in '76. Obviously co-op primarily, I'll mix up a little spiciness but 99% fun and friendly, same with my crew. Don't understand PVP really except as a quick lark.  Also I still say '76 is great solo, building Camps, exploring, and discovering the story. Anyway, our experiences are different and anecdotal, but I think most players I've met and like in '76 are longtime fans.
---
Yeah.
---
I also got a piece of wood armor and a piece of 1* weightless armor. The probability of 3 spawning at once is insane.
---
not that i have figured out ...why can't they be like the blinking lights that you buy in the atom shop 
---
Some would say similar things for duplicating it still hurt the game
---
I'll just stick with repairing my gear the old fashion way, with the added bonus of the advanced repair kits we will be getting from the Queen and other routes. No need to spend money.
---
You have to give psn name bud 
---
Paying real money for ingame itens really sucks but let me try to point developer's side.
---
They had a terrible launch and they are triyng to revamp the game, as a compliment they said every patch going to be free. But how they are supposed to pay everyone whos working hard every day to bring us new content? Fo76 dont have subscription neither paid dlcs so their only option is the atom shop, indeed im "donating" 10bucks/monts as a sort of sub to support them and tell how much i like their game.
---
Look, this is one point of view, im not saying in your wrong, as the contrary,i agree with you, but every story has two sides. 
---
Cheers.
---
I stopped playing the game for a number of reasons. Aside from aimlessly grinding scrap after level 90 or so, the game had little to offer. After putting hundreds, quite possibly thousands of hours into ES III through V, ESO, and FO 3 and 4, I had high hopes for 76. I didn't play at launch, opting instead to save 60 bucks and see how it was post launch.
---
The limited beta should have been a huge warning sign. I'm sure to many it was. Anyways, amidst a multitude of horrible reviews, and subsequent trolling, I couldn't not play the game. At first, it was enjoyable enough to play through the stories, hit end game, and feel confident enough to tackle almost any content (aside from queens), solo. Then it sank in.
---
The game, as a whole, was lacking. What I had come to expect from BGS had been lost in today's generation of game design and publishing. Today's market is geared to contonuously make money. The days of a one time 60 dollar investment (with possible 20 to 30 dollar drops on DLC) are behind us. The all mighty dollar is king, and it's become painstakingly obvious that the voices of players are being suppressed by greed. 
---
Through ambiguous language, people like Todd Howard can say one thing, and ultimately do another, and some people refuse to bat an eye. I'm not bashing on anyone who enjoys the game. I enjoyed it well enough until reality set in. However, until we take action (not support these companies by purchasing their content), things will stay the same, if not get worse.
---
There is actually a raider base with an arena. It's small but they could expand it or build something nearby
---
Yup,i agree with your point of view 👍
---
Have you noticed whether covert operative works in pvp? 
---
I prefer the affect attached to the weapon, ammo is unwieldy - especially in an inventory system that’s already cluttered 
---
Oh so power armor is only good for pve pretty much?
---
Are boxing gloves included too?
---
To me, I think people are over reacting. But, if they are going to come out no matter what, make them really cheap. Like 10 for 100 atoms or something. That way off people want to pay money for them they can, but also super cheap if they don't.
---
Well they can’t all be winners now can they?
---
Thanks for the funny Dad, Mikey likes it. 💕
---
I understand where you’re coming from but I feel like you’re purposefully not laying out the full picture. 
---
These items will be available in game as well as purchasable with currency that is laughably easy to get. If someone plays this game longer than someone else they would have an advantage due to better gear would they not? This is an analogous scenario.. those who play the game for longer are able to earn more atoms and buy whatever they want in the shop for free as well as farm better versions of the items in game. 
---
You can say that Pay to Win doesn’t mean exactly what it sounds like but that’s just lazy, call it something else then besides pay to win. 
---
Everyone wants to use the slippery slope analogy but it’s flawed imo because we all know the dangers of truly P2W MTX. No one is going to allow Bethesda to get always with P2W items but if they need to include QOL items in the shop that don’t give any tangible advantage over other players then I’m fine with it so that we can keep these servers running and new content pumping out for years to come.
---
Definitely would be nice yeah. What would be fair to give us though? More atoms? The new repair kits? 
---
I agree poker and blackjack ran by a robot 
---
Wisconsin Dells, Cave of the Mounds, New Glarus, Ft. McCoy, Mirror Lake SP; the Kettle Moraine area seems like it would work best.  If expanded toward the north, it could include the mythical Hodag(Rhinelander) and an Ed Gein themed faction of cannibals.  Maybe a native American themed area and some serious hillbillies in the northwoods.
---
Eh, Nuke zone PvP too, imo. but i run a stealthboy X01 and stick to roofs, there.
---
Generally speaking though, yes. PA is inviting death in PVP. This is why I now only have 4 stompy PA toons, not 5. 
---
Has anyone else noticed that ever since the brewing update, Class Freak doesn't seem to have any effect on the increased hunger/thirst caused by Speed Demon mutation?
---
I've switched out Class Freak for Good With Salt, and honestly, it seems like I get hungry/thirst *slower* when I don't have Class Freak equipped.
---
That would make more sense
---
It was mentioned in the same sentence as the repair kits in the same update. 
---
Build. Be creative. Even with the limitations, there’s a lot you can do. 
---
I'm coming!
---
Oh ok Got yah,  so just to get people to spend atoms lol 
---
So, you're supposed to know every word in the English language before finishing school?
---
Got it, thanks.
---
I get it, but I don't \_accept\_ it.  There are \_so\_ many different ways they could do cosmetics only that's profitable.   
---
Instead of selling craft-able paintjobs, transfer that into paint mods, for a reasonable amount of atoms. Instead of 600-800 atoms to unlock the ability to make a given type of armor match a given paintjob, sell a mod that can change any armor to that color pallet, for say 50 atoms. Some people who never ever change their gear up will come out a little ahead, people who keep upgrading and swapping out builds will end up spending more.   
---
More atoms  all over all, but it's for something that's \_cosmetic\_.   
---
Add more colors, more items from old games, and more new content. Do basic fucking paint swaps and let us have whatever paintjob on whatever kind of armor we want to use. 
---
Only snipers and black powder rifles harpoon guns  etc some melee should be one shot kills 
---
Yeah I only play adventure prolly get sniped and lose all my stuff in survival and turn the game off for a few days
---
I find them near Dyer chemical by the river. Someone said only at night and it's always dark when I go there and see them.
---
vacume tubes!
---
Insult bot as the dealer?! Or a close robot relative hehe
---
Don’t have the link handy like the next commenter might, but it’s all about the stealth/vats crits/handmaiden rifle build. All the rifle effect cards are still way stronger than any other weapon type so
---
I’d definitely go that direction. 
---
Whats dealing enough damage to kill you before you get to it in power armor ? Or is this PVP.. 'cause then yeah, out of luck, there. 
---
Yeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh!
---
I agree. I previously would have said Unarmed is OP when compared to the other melee classes, but the way it is now is just horrible. Do less damage, just not a buggy system of no damage on the first swing at all. 
---
Keep two of one of the masks so you can do the headless glitch whenever you want. 
---
4 million dollars for a car that you'll only use once because it has specific flags that make them uncompetitive in any race. 
---
no plastic pumpkins, meh
---
True
---
Gaming in general has been like this for years. Once consoles got online capabilities the cash grab was on. I understand that people go hey this is the start of Bethesda doing what every other publisher does but its still an optional buy in and we have the ability to earn atoms daily for free. This a very mild attempt at generating revenue. This game sold poorly and they are a business and all business exist to make money. Having some items may piss people off but the money they get keeps this game running and funds future games. I know people want or stupidly say they're done with Zenimax. Well great that will only worsen gaming and in that case you are no longer a customer and your concerns invalid.
---
 This isnt even in the same galaxy of EA or Take2's money grubbing. Please go play GTAO or RDRO or NBA2K, Go play Madden or fifa ultimate team and see what pay to win and shameless cash grabbing really is. Ill take 4 combined outfits a 3 friends and a consumable that i can easily buy with the free atoms i earn by playing. So im in the camp of its not a big deal, maybe their next game will be worse but having played the above games this hardly feels like gamers are being screwed. If anything theyre at least buying us dinner and sweetly kissing us before asking us to bend over and thats a welcome change.
---
Give us Caravan!
---
I would love some Skyrim gear into this game. Maybe eventually skins that change how everything looks? 
---
Welp Alcatraz would make a badass brotherhood base for starters 
---
They would need some kind of sea-lion monsters at Pier 39
---
A spin off of the Zodiac killer as an evil villain 
---
Sourdough and chocolate consumables
---
Focus on wine as the alcohol of choice
---
The raiders stadium...well, their old stadium, could be for...raiders lol
---
All that comes to mind right away 
---
Even worse, I keep drinking whiskey all the time
---
I see your point. I  am habitually spamming the reload button whenever I'm drawn so it doesn't seem as annoying, but that's just me. 
---
yes because everyone on reddit is a liar right? because no one is actually interested in the truth and ONLY experts are allowed to do any research.
---
Bulk saves weight on some items but not all. That's what I have read. I bulk all anyway. That way it's sellable if I want to dump some. But scrap all junk will unbulk any you are carrying.
---
I try not to take seriously anything said by someone who would go into debt for a philosophy degree.
---
An EASY way to make fairly consistent caps, is to set up some water purifiers and sell to the vendors. It’s not the quickest way, but it’s simple.
---
I’ve seen Bethesda comment on posts with less up votes and comments. To me this just shows that everything he’s saying is true. They are being shady about the spoil rate and they will most likely put the fridge in the atom shop. Even though they won’t “make us” buy the fridge we’d kinda be forced too since so many people like to keep food in their inventory. 
---
I like the idea of it but then I think I would get irritated with having to switch between them depending on the situation. I think the mechanism works well for turned based games but would be hard to implement in real time games. 
---
Yes!  This is what 76 is missing, more prostitution.
---
Pretty awesome. 
---
rofl ok, sure thing buddy
---
These aren't cosmetic:
---
"Mailbox - 100/200 Units of stash that we can share with others in our C.A.M.P Credit : u/Riomaki"
---
"Full Respec of cards : Credit u/noMercy1987"
---
"Scorched radar - A working replica of Firebreathers ( i think ) sensor tower for scorched that will react with red glowing light if enemy scorched is nearby"
---
For me it's been clothes. They are light and some of them fetch decent prices...golf outfits and preachers can net 20ish each.
---
It's made of neutrinos. Very angry neutrinos.
---
I suppose it's possible, but at level 136, I find it really hard to believe that that's been the case for everyone else I've "seen" speaking since I've started playing the game.
---
mister gutsy 5.56 and 10 mm in nuke bunkers and mire queen acid as well as the small crayfish acid 
---
not to mention pvp shotgun blasts 
---
all i’m asking for is my def and resistance stats to be higher and my loose hand to have something to block with.
---
ya feel
---
wander around earning caps so I can get plans
---
Don't buy anything. Everything you need can be gotten for free by scrounging and using perks.
---
Hey. You can never have too many rubbers. Especially with all the diseases floating around the wasteland.
---
You can try and get the plans for that hat and using super duper. Make a shit ton of em for one leather and mass sell them to all vendors.
---
That's the lightest way.
---
A few other methods overencumber big time
---
No, no, that's from a glowing superfart.
---
Well played sir.
---
Hey, I have a list of bugs / suggestions:
---
**BUGS**
---
* When I use a stimpak (pressing the quick heal key, H in my case), a [weird directional pad icon](https://imgur.com/a/lPWWb2Y) shows up even tough I don't have a controller connected
---
* The Hooded Rags is taking up all armor slots, not counting as "over armor" outfit
---
* &amp;#x200B;
---
**IMPROVEMENTS**
---
* Possibility to change the quick slot keys
---
* Separate grenade key from bash key
---

---
   * EXPLOSIVES tab
---
   * OUTFITS tab

* Quick "consume" button. Just like you can press a key to directly play an holotape in the world without having to pick it up first
---
   * There could be a button for eating food, like, E) TAKE R) EAT
---
   * Quick drinking
---
   * Quick read plans / recipes
---
   * Quick read magazines
---

   * Quick use stimpaks / radaway / chems
---
   * This feature could work while browsing a container as well
---
**FEATURES FROM FO4 AND FO3**
---
* Add the Scrapper 2 perk from FO4 that used to highlight items in the world with components that you tagged for search

---
**SUGGESTIONS**
---
* Change the paper bag model (that players drop when they die) for something else more immersive like a pile of junk or something
---
Love the game!
---
Gotta get that 16% return, or you get ousted by the shareholders.  Makes it hard to look past the next quarter 
---
I'm still nuking the Scorchbeast Queen so I can get a prime LMG receiver. There's new quests on the way soon too.
---
Thanks!!!
---
Thanks!!
---
No problem. Any time.
---
Wait for reals?
---
Gwent!
---
full respec should be in atom shop IMO or at lvl 50 for free once then respec by atom shop , Mailbox i will give you a point on that it was an idea copied from previos post aaaaand scorched radar stays beacuse its a cool idea and its just so badly situational that i gives no advantage over others... maybe yet
---
Can you fix my knee pad please
---
Search every container you come across as you can. Trash cans, toolboxes big and small, yellow wooden crates, etc. Also fortune finder perk card on prompt while searching a caps stash allows you to search for more caps with the 'search' button. Dead super mutants carry caps up to a player certain level, guaranteed.
---
Being able to instantly repair your equipment at any time has no impact on balance in the game? Learn some perspective.
---
understandable then hopefully you get your taste of a FO styled game when the outer world releases
---
Definitely insane odds
---
So I mean, do you want the Atom Shop to be cosmetic only or not? Respec is *way* more P2W than repair kits.
---
At this current point in time, I'm only playing 76 because it's installed. If these things actually hit the ingame store for a day or longer, I will uninstall. No skin off my back to ignore the start of pay to progress AAA gaming.
---
This is such a major issue that it makes me wonder if they are leaving it on purpose.  It completely ruins buying legengaries from vendors, as you have no way of knowing what you are buying.  I can't really think of any reason they would purposely do it, but the lack of a fix on such a game breaking simple change seems strange.  Perhaps this is what the legendary vendor will be like, lottery to see what you get.
---
That's because they obviously don't care about shitstorms.
---
So it couldn't impact pvp at all? Really? Weapon breaks in the middle of a fight, you have an objective advantage over someone who doesn't have access to the repair kits. 
---
And again it starts with this, they could then justify almost anything.
---
&gt; And ‘let these slide’? As if we have any control whether or not these get instituted
---
We do... Voicing our opinions about what wether players want. Did you want this game to turn into pay to win? If not then we have to make it clear we don't want such items in the game.
---
I only wish I'd done it sooner. Myself and a couple other people seemed to be purely melee, so that's a substantial amount of damage being lost while she just hovered in the air.
---
Once I built the little tower, a couple people moved in, but really just being able to melee her for 2k-ish per hit does a nice bit of damage.
---
They are spun up as needed. Virtualization does wonders.
---
I would say music would still fall under the "cosmetic" category. It has no real impact on the gameppay, sp I would be ok with it in the atom shop
---
If Bethesda paid a single employee to work on a new atom shop outfit every week, they would make more money than Rockstar weh GTA V launched
---
Shame they are so rare.
---
They had non cosmetics from the first day with the generators
---
K thanks
---
Every MMO in existence has a full respec mechanic. Nope not FO76, if you want to try that new weapon or build, you need to grind 30 more levels for a month!
---
This concept just got more necessary now that Risk Of Rain 2 is out.
---
Works here 
---
I said it a million times before. I'll say it again. Todd Howard can suck a dick. 
---
He's allowed fallout to become a piece of shit.
---
Uhh, sorry my guy, but those replacements bags have BEEN sent out
---
If anyone is interested in how to correctly monetize cosmetic items, hop on over to /r/rainbowsix
---
Basically, ubisoft figured out that charging for weapon skins and player outfits made them more money than pissing people off. I can't tell you how many people I used to see in that game who'd run around all blinged out, not reeeaaaallly caring a out winning matches.
---
So yeah, more weapon skins too please. And lower prices a tad. Like 50% across the board, for all time, and people won't even realize there just spending money on non-permanent ones and zeroes that can just be copied over and over without maintaining stocks of physical items. 
---
I started with fallout 3 and have been playing sense. I'd love to see a dlc for 76 that bridges the time between 76 and fallout 3 a bit. 76 has come a long way and a lot of issues have been fixed, other mistakes made and many rants about crazy topics. But the game is pretty good, except that its a constant grind most of the time looking for materials.
---
Create a shit ton of what with 1 leather?
---
First off, I get the sense you're disagreeing in good faith, and that's cool. Kudos. Respect.
---
You can dispute the term "pay to win" on semantics, and that's fine, but no matter what it gets named, it is a negative move, and needs to be heartily opposed on its substance at every turn. 
---
Not understanding the dangers of P2W is kind of the whole crux of this thing. The idea is that they introduce a relatively innocuous gameplay advantage for cash, and since it's innocuous, the community is supposed to tolerate it. Then a sightly less innocuous one, then an intrustive one, and soon enough we're buying TSE weapons for $20. 
---
That's how monetization works. You probe and test your playerbase to see what they will tolerate. For FO76, I very much hope thatt the players respond with "cosmetics only"
---
Not alot of details really. Its one vendor. Idk if he will be in a set location or if he travels around. We will be able to scrap legendaries and trade them in to this vendor in an attempt to get other legendary items. So a 3 star item increases your chance Of getting a better 3 star, etc. Hopefully its not some random loot roll. But i think its a little over a month away.
---
Bethesda is trying their best to fix the game, All of you people just want drama and Clicks , just give them a chance, 
---
Stop hating just cause.
---
Whitesprings. Ghould drop a shit ton of it. 
---
Keep this on the low but my AA pipe rifle benefits from gunslinger and rifleman perks and when those 18 card slots are active lol not sure if bug or feature 
---
Here's what i sell to the different faction vendors:
---
Bulked junk that i have to much of.
---
Weapons and low lvl legendary weapons
---
Low lvl and low lvl legendary armor
---
Mothmann omeletes
---
Chems i dont use or have to much of
---
Bipolar with the memory of a goldfish
---
Shits like an abusive relationship and I’m just here with my popcorn
---
you mean the reduced falling damage on legendary armor? if so then 50% and yes if you have 2 pieces it completely negates falling damage
---
and it doesn't just appear on legs i have one on a chest piece
---
Next year, lol.  Actually, I love 76...
---
Screw those youtubers and reporters they’re all click bait af and don’t care about this games success.
---
Dont try to act like people with differing views than you don’t care about the future of this game, some of us just aren’t willing to call QOL items pay to win when you can easily buy them with currency earned in game and also find better versions in game. 
---
Basically your argument is anything that the mainstream media doesn’t like is bad for this game? That’s a total hogwash conformist attitude that has never represented the Fallout community. 
---
There is that food reviewer 5* general or whatever who had visited different food venues and rates them before and after the nukes dropped. 
---
I mean the daily quests seem to be a reward for actually playing the game everyday, I’m not a big fan of just rewarding people for logging in. Like how bout you play it for 5 minutes and do some challenges instead to actually engage people in the game. Just my 2 caps.
---
seems that heavy weapons builds are also pretty effective, hard to use vats when under heavy minigun fire.
---
Pick some places you like that net things people need like lead, farm for a while, and sell on the market sub. 
---
Fort defiance has plenty of straight jackets that you can vendor. 
---
Super mutants often drop caps as well as screws that can be sold to players. 
---
I have and nothing. So i thought I'd try here ona limb 
---
Yeah. Surplus. 1000 bullets for 23 caps.
---
Yo I never said I disagreed. I dont think it's worth the online equivalent of barricading the roads and burning patrol cars,  but mostly I want people to know what they're mad about if they're going to be mad. 
---
Still supporting this continued dumpster fire then.
---
Downvotes without any kind of response, because you know I'm right, to the left pls.
---
Getting sick of these repair kit posts lol
---
All duct tape, and glue. 
---
They make it really hard to defend this game and talk about it with people who ask I can say that much.
---
Of course they will. They wanted a cash cow. This isn’t that, so now they’re resorting to scamming us more than they already did when they charged $60-$200. Bethesda’s gone.
---
Agreed. I bought the power armour edition because I was so excited but I can't bring myself to play it anymore. So disappointment in Bethesda as a company 
---
Exactly.  Its total crap.
---
Yes, it has no impact on the balance of gameplay because it's for someone who doesn't like scavenging. It's really simple.
---
At this point, it's just copy and pasting the same points that have been said a million times.
---
I assure you there is still a very working dupe glitch.too many duped items to not be
---
3, NV, 4, and with plans to dive into the OG's (1,2 and tactics).
---
I bought 76 because i love the lore. The interloper hidden quest line is a fucking trip, and I hope they add some quest markers and XP for it so that the clean casuals can experience it.
---
Showing off camps and items, and running quests coop just seems like a no-brainer. Some of the most fun I have had was doing a nuke run with some older farts who have played ALL of them, plus the text based DnD and "choose your own adventure" PC games that the franchise is based on and pays homage to. (I've you've played 3 as much as I have, you know the easter egg I'm referencing).
---
I do see lots of fallout newbs, and I'm like "oh my god I'm so sorry, please stop what you're doing and play New Vegas". Its mostly highschoolers that are like that, but mid 20's and up seem to know whats up. The little kids that play this... sometimes I yell "HEY MOM, DAD, YOUR KID DOEN'T NEED TO BE PLAYING THIS!!" To which I typically just hear "Turn that crap down sweetie". 
---
I exaggerated the last bit, but everyone please band together and do the thing I just said when you encounter a 5 year old that can barely speak yet.
---
But don't the pixels run out if you leave them on for too long ?
---
I just find that argument to be a non starter. Is it bad PR for Bethesda to go back on their cosmetic only statement? Absolutely. But is it a sign of worse things to come? I don’t believe so.
---
I think who ever is in charge of the atomic shop messed up because people are not incentivized to buy cosmetics rn. You can say cosmetics only all you want but what happens when no ones buying them and the incentive to keep producing new content and keep the servers running is not there? The game dies. 
---
Personally I’m encouraged by the fact that Bethesda has listened to the community and introduced QOL items that we wanted. I’m even more encouraged by the system where I can collect 500+ atoms a week easily and buy whatever I want from the atomic shop without spending any real world money. And I’m even more encouraged by them including better versions of these items in game for people to find. 
---
My point is that you’re assuming people don’t understand the dangers of P2W, we do but we don’t believe this crosses the line. And trust me when I say we’ll be the loudest critics if anything P2W were ever even hinted at, but these QOL items DO NOT fit that criteria. You can say that’s semantics but it’s really not it’s just facts. 
---
This could be tied in with the repeatable forbidden knowledge quest. Maybe you get like five kits for every technical data or something like that.
---
They said leg mods, not legendary armor. I don't know the answer OP, but you may want either the perk or Legendary armor with the prefix.
---
might be interested in wastelad? its like grognak but fallout themed.
---
Okay, we get it, you hate Bethesda because they're making mistakes on their FIRST MMO (let me say that ESO was not done by Bethesda but by their parent company, Zenimax). What? You expected everyone there to be perfect machines?
---
Bethesda says there are “millions” of players. Someone posted something earlier indicating 2 million on PS4 alone. (No, I can’t find it, but it makes sense) 
---
The servers are virtual and increase and decrease as needed with volume. 
---
Understanding that all the players aren’t on at the same time, it’s still safe to assume the server count numbers in the tens of thousands per platform, even at off peak times, possibly exceeding 100k during peaks. 
---
Need a Gamer perk. So I dont accidentally almost kill myself for playing games 5 days ingame.
---
TIL The Broadsider is an explosive weapon.
---
Pick up enemy guns and sell them to vendor's. Get large water purifiers and sell the water. Make sure you have hard bargain to get more caps out of the things you sell.
---
But...... you haven't paid for the atom store stuff..... kind of the point of the atom store
---
Oh man!! And then you could take the bottle bomb and use it as ammo in a syringer. Causes enemies to experience a dizzying effect and take explosive damage. 
---
Not an MMO, and a respec is not cosmetic.
---
Should you be able to do it? Definitely.
---
Should it be in the microtransaction shop? Fuck no.
---
I think that you just made the biggest leap of conclusions of all time. But whatever keeps you busy, I guess.
---
The game as a whole is what I paid for.
---
It's already not purely cosmetic.
---
You can get weapon/armor skins which protects those items from accidental trading/dropping. (Unintentional but still has a gameplay impact.)
---
You can buy gameplay impacting CAMP items, e.g. power generation and water purifying, which otherwise require going through the main questline, finding the plans in the world, or buying them for caps. (Negligible but still has a gameplay impact.)
---
There are emotes which are only available in the atom store, and emotes are the only means of communication when one party can't/won't use a mic. (Negligible but still has a gameplay impact.)
---
Personally, if they're as described, I don't find the repair kits having a much stronger gameplay impact.  You'd have to not pay attention to your gear status or not carry any backups in a situation where you might actually have to worry about it if you DO pay attention to gear status, and be okay with only a 100% repair.  I suppose they'll save some mats if you don't mind spending the atoms...
---
Here’s my somewhat specialized take as an economist who has a hobbyists interest in online mometization models: 
---
They did the math before they figured out monetization of what kind of player base they could expect, retention/attrition rates, cash shop sales based on comparable and industry estimates and decided that as long as they had X income which requires Y average players they would be able to cover costs of servers and development and that number could be comfortably achieved by cosmetic sales based on simmilar games - so they committed to it.
---
Then they shit the bed in one of the worst launches in modern videogames on an unprecedented level by releasing a game in early Beta state, the player base evaporated like a thin sheet of boiling water in the Sahara desert and when the re-evaluated the numbers they said - if this continues, the game starts operating at a loss and if people have stuck around this long, through all this shit, all but the margins will put up with anything.
---
So here’s the difference: you didn’t engage in a MAJOR fuckup, shit all over your player base and then ask your already exploited player base of full price beta testers to bail you out, while betraying your word, the promise which gave you the slack to put micro transactions in a $60 game instead of using a Free2Play model so you could recoup dev costs fast and be able to worry less about being on the hook for the quality of the product.
---
You weren’t taking a risk to secure profits, they were. That matters, a lot. 
---
I'm just gonna leave this here : [https://nukacrypt.com/solved](https://nukacrypt.com/solved)
---
Or just replace your stash with multiples of every alcohol.
---
Old problem solved, new problem gained!
---
On a more serious note, the few times biv has asked me to craft a brew if I had it in my inventory or pulled it out my stash it completed that portion of the quest.
---
I got his bubba gump shrimp-esque rant whilst he lackidasily cleared houses of level 1 scorched with his hammer. Just talking along for a good minute or two. Most hilarious thing that happened by chance that ive seen in this game.
---
Farm cap stashes.  Every day you can easily make 500 plus caps off just the stashes. There's like 5 at the nuka cola plant on the outside, 10 at Poseidon power plant on the outside, like 5 around Morgantown. If you have the cap collector perk you can search them as well to find more. There's stashes everywhere in the game. Plus sell your junk to vendors. That's 1400 caps a day. Invest in travel agent if you fast travel a bunch. Utilize vault 76 and your c.a.m.p. to cut down fast travel costs.
---
a bit later here but I think this was some kind of bug, the key should spawn in the safe that is closed by a passcode.
---
i have seen multiple reports of it showing up inside a level 2 lock room in the ashes, I have try going there but no luck. I had to do all the steps and find mine in the right place.

Indiana, here. I can't really think of much except a lot of flat land and corn. Also mason jars out the wazoo. A Fallout version of Ball State. Indianapolis would've been the main city to go to (of course). Other than all that, there's nothing much else about Indiana to write home about unless a fellow Hoosier would come up with something a lot better than what I can come up with.
---
True. And if the posters were concerned with getting Bethesda's attention, they post it on Twitter, or Bethesda's boards. 
---
I don't -think- spawning in there should kill it, since afaik you can still build in nuke zones right now. Might be a bug ? 
---
The language they use in the announcement “unlockable” almost makes me think that you will be able to to buy the recipe to make them, not the item it’s self.   They might go this route to make implementation of the items easy on the community.
---
I wear it with responders firemen helmet

Better yet, replace Fallout 76 with normal Fallout: NV and see how long it'll take before anyone complains.
---
Ranger armor and...
---
wait for it....
---
Sexy armor. Just sort Nexus mods by most unique downloads, that's one of the biggest draws for people, sexy armor!
---
They realized that people aren’t as engaged in the shop as they would like. So they are trying to find things to offer that will keep interests high in farming for atoms. 
---
fort defiance then get straight jackets, with rank 3 barter perk they sell 42 caps per and there's plenty of them in there.. and they weigh like 0.01. so it's like they're not there.
---
I was in this since beta, I played every fallout since release. You’re right, the game is buggy, the disconnects are numerous, the pay to pay BS is coming. But that doesn’t mean I have to follow. Sure, they are making it so guns break faster to make repair kits viable, sure they are making food soil faster to make their new fridges a necessity . But I paid full fucking price for this game and will continue to play it regardless. I can find scrap and fix my shit, I can equip cannibal and carnivore mutation and eat whatever, I can carry some disease cures and drink whatever water I come across. Basically, I can counter any BS they come up with and STILL play the game. I’m smarter than they are. 
---
Yep. As far as I know, they don't even go here unless it's about the super recent update. And even that's only once in a blue moon.
---
**I HAVE THE SOLUTION TO THIS!**
---
Have whatever drink you need ready, server hop until the quest pops back up on log-in, drink your booze and quickly perform the sneak attack, crit, purchase, eat spoiled food, or other action it asks you to. Apparently just being in game with the quest active for long enough can mess it up. But do this and it WILL eventually work. I have had the issue twice, and both times these actions fixed it and allowed me to complete the quest.
---
is that ingame graphic or real life??
---
You’re overreacting. It’s just a repair kit. Relax. It’s like people want something to be upset about all the time. Bethesda has created so many countless hours of fun for us. In no way at all will an atom shop repair kit tarnish their name or effect my gameplay or enjoyment. People have got to chill out about this kind stuff. You ethically object over a repair kit? Simple, don’t buy it. The atom shop is there to fund DLC and there’s a year of DLC planned. If a repair kit causes a shitstorm, everybody is way too high strung. Just my opinion, but  I’m tired of the negativity on these forums. Its a video game, relax and enjoy it 
---
I've never placed my camp close enough to try but, at whitesprings around the snake on the map is a small pond and a concession stand with a lock on it.
---
I know you can place your camp on that building because my circle was big enough to put the snowman inflatable and vault boy behind the counter.
---
I just don't know if you'd be able to place your own lock on it.
---
Came in 3-ish weeks after Fallout 2, and have played every Fallout (Except BoS)
---
Some weapons are both 1h and unarmed like meat hook and others are pistol and rifle like pipe guns that you add a grip to
---
We already bought the game.  Catering to us only loses them money.  The new players weren't there for the past promises, so they won't feel betrayed.  It's nothing personal.  It's just business.
---
Afaik, you should be able to get around this by having a character that hasn't done the BoS quests mule them. I'm pretty sure once a player picks them up, the stack gets invisibly tagged as a quest item, after that point, it doesnt matter which one / how many you turn in, the game recognises them as that particular stack, hence the issues. 
---
😭 damn that’s messed up!!!
---
this,im pretty sure those people that bitch about fallout 76 monetization don't even play games anymore and solely bitch on forums 
---
game has no lootboxes,no battle pass,no season pass,no subscription,no expansions and people STILL BITCH
---
The food spoilage is a bug introduced with the fermenter
---
I for one didn’t really care about the other controversies. They are trying to introduce something that is the worst trend in gaming I’ve seen so this I care about. Something I’ve seen make a game like gta online  have so many flaws that were designed On purpose which is frustrating cause at the same time it could have been so good but you know it wont be fixed cause rockstar wants it to be frustrating. And I love 76 and I’d hate to have to start wondering what bad game designs were put in on purpose just to push me to pay. At least that’s why I’m up in arms about this when I wasn’t about other stuff. 
---
Thanks for joining mate. Hopefully u got something good.
---
I did and found them, but they want like 1400 or something like that.. But thanks
---
You're a hero you, took those t-bags like a champ
---
And literally anything else in the Atomic store. That doesn't mean they are in the game...
---
I live in Los Angeles ........So little would change. 
---
&gt; this cycle of reading into stuff the
---
It's hard to read more into repair kits being on the atomic store when they flat out say that repair kits are going to be on the atomic store.
---
Honestly if you put all the weapon and armor workbenches on the map, and also allowed people to show their camp location with player vending, I can’t imagine anyone wanting to buy these when they see how many repair camps there are.
---
Your right blooms only spawn at night a recipe that biv wants requires some blooms
---
Well what they watch and what they are more inclined to respond to can be different and the same. This is a community on Reddit where they are lurking but not getting into discussions. Where as twitter, you are talking directly to their account. Makes it more direct for them to feel more a need to respond. Also more viewers on twitter. 
---
But still don’t believe they don’t come here based on a “far as I know” rumor.  That’s just trying to squash all kinds of discussion and complaints.  Cause why talk about it if no one is listening. But I dint think either of us know for sure if Reddit is looked at anymore.  But they have commented directly to me in the past.  
---
Yes chainsaw is all about badassness not damage 😂👍🏻
---
If you hit up a farm, like arronholt, they almost all have all of those things already planted and ready for you. As such you can skip the farming step and just use up those / take the mats from there to start your own farm. 
---
Alternately, just hunt down anglers, they drop it. 
---
Well,As my build is probaly the worst one, i could use a perk point resetting option.
---
Just a bug. Happened to me too. 
---
I've done that event and so I have a question.
---
How the heck do I get those boxes at the top???
---
I'm too short and it's killing me, I see that you're open box!!? Lemme in!!!!
---
I know, it spoils much faster now than it used to even in our stash (it used to be safe from
---
spoilage as far as I could tell *but* it may have just always been used so I never saw it spoil but I do now.)
---
the timing on the food spoiling bug seemed to cause a louder vocal round of "hey food spoiking faster, functional coolers? can we get fridges?" which led to their mention of refrigerators (not clear if atom store purchase or not)
---
Northern Idaho:
---
We have some pretty great lakes here including Lake Pend Oreille. This is home to military testing with small subs due the depth, 1,150 ft at the deepest point. 
---
You cannot lock yourself out, no. This is a known bug, generally logging off and going on to a differnt server will bring them back. If that doesnt work. Quit all the way out and restart. After that point, contact support 'cause something has broken. 
---
If its sterilized by a fuck load of radiation it is, tho. 
---
Heeeeeeeellllllll yessssss!!!! Shut up and take my money! Capitalism FTW if they make this happen!!!
---
Capitalism Boo if they go full pay to win instead. Please don't make me boo BGS 😢
---
It could backfire significantly.  If the game becomes a freemium pay-to-play game it's going to lose the core players that have made it great.
---
With the Tesla rifle?
---
Man those damned gutsy's get me every time, I'm 100+ with half decent gear and a level 22 gutsy is just eating my soul with his little cap gun.
---
Just a misreading
---
Yes, a lot of things are off since then. None of my friends can join me or travel to me anymore. At times they're unable to see me on the map even.
---
Yes. Awareness. Yes...
---
Driving away players that are your "core" is a losing scenario.  
---
Yes, yes, a thousand times yes!
---
A decade worth of Counter-Strike and Halo prepared me for that moment.
---
Leather bikers cap in the atoms shop
---
Ooooor just make it an option in the Pip-Boy menu and don’t charge for that?
---
So it won't do anything in PVP?
---
And it really doesn't matter what it is for, it is selling game mechanics for money. That has bad implications for the rest of the game and future cash shop items.
---
They absolutely don't.
---
Source: All those PvPers that take no damage from an instigating explosvie Gauss hit to the head. 
---
Afterthought, it is the queen, so I guess you could just say I went spelunking.
---
True but if it was just a rejoin last server button I would not see an issue.
---
Lets be real here, you could probably adapt all the top-down fallouts to run flawlessly on iOS/ Android/ a raspberry pi powered by a potato. Its probably just out of graphing calculator territory, sadly.
---
Hey BGS marketing team! Gimme an irl pip-boy that runs fallout 1. I'd pay like 100 bucks for that!
---
Can't really say that as they don't usually address bug fixes in the in the vaults. 
---
Haven’t logged in since December. Was going to give it a shot and see if the problems were tolerable yet and if they’d fixed core mechanics and gameplay issues (some players said it was getting ok-ish), then I saw the repair kits posts.
---
Nah. I’m not even going to send the signal of a single inactive player pushing their internal metrics up by 1 with this shit going on. I’ve been hoping that BGS just conned me into giving them a $60, 0%APR loan for six months to a year for an actual finished product - but if they are going to add this shit I absolutely under no circumstances would have laid out those $60 purchases, and I absolutely will never play this game, buy atoms for cosmetics or likely purchase another BGS game again. At least.
---
If they come out and issue an unequivcal statement that they are not, never will and made a mistake even considering adding non cosmetic micro transactions I’ll give it a shot - once the game is finished maybe I’ll even spend $10 on something from the Atomshop if anything interesting like a Chinese stealth suit skin is up by then.
---
It would have been nice if the community collectively said that instead of freaking out. There were a million posts about all those who won’t even pick up the game now because of this small change.
---
Honestly knew about fallout since 2 came out (and tried one cause I heard such good things about 2 but figured I should play them in order). 1 is actually the hardest fallout for me to get into and after several tries (I really wanted to play 2 and stupidly got stubbern about playing 1 first) it wasn’t until I played 3 (after it was really old)that I got really into fallout. New Vegas is my favorite one though and I finally played 2 and yes it lived up to the hype (my second favorite). So yeah, I’d consider myself one, I certainly am not playing 76 cause it is an my game (in fact I was not stoked that it was and when they announced it had pvp I was outright pissed. It’s the fact I’m a sucker for fallout and the world looked really interesting which is the only reason I still went for it. I liked it even in the beta (it was ok and it felt like fallout and I did not see too many other people and they left me alone). It has honestly grown on me and I’m totally addicted now. I don’t know if I’d rate it with other fallouts, I see it more as an offshoot.
---
No ammo in my shotgun, second equipped weapon literally there one second, gone the next, got a .308 rifle and a .50 Cal rifle? Well pick the .50 Cal on the wheel and boom its magically a .308.  Two melee? Which one you want? Too bad it's the other one
---
The food you pick up doesn't spoil. It's the food you cook and any vegetation/animals you harvest. Makes sense to me.
---
When they aren't bugged. I know people who can't get a single daily to trigger anymore 
---
People make piles of cash off of Ponzi schemes all the time.  All you need are enough new investors to keep it going for a while.  The beauty with an online video game Ponzi scheme is that, after a certain point, failure is actually a good thing.  You no longer have to maintain servers.  You don't have to update anything.  And, you no longer have to pay employees to stroke off gamers on Reddit.
---
It's always when someone drops something like that at a vendor. Sure it's not a god roll, but it's certainly nice to have if you don't have one!
---
I think it’s a set location from what I’ve seen. It’s in the more as an unmarked train station that you cannot enter (yet) and if you look through the window cracks you can see the location from the trailer. 
---
Been here since Fallout. I don't particularly like pvp in a FO game, and even multiplayer is iffy for me. I play 99% of my game solo. I avoid interacting too frequently with other players.
---
But the way this game does multiplayer is damned near perfect, even for someone like me that would prefer to play solo. It adds another layer to the game. Otherwise, this would be exactly like FO3 and FO4. But it's not; I can take a workshop and get some rewards. If this was FO4, it'd just be another settlement with some farms and whatnot. And most of the time I'll take a workshop, get some plans, get some resources generating, and maybe a player will come by. I'll leave everything unlocked to spread the love, and because maybe if the resources are free they won't try to take it and hog it all themselves. Mostly this just behaves like any single player game - I don't see other players, and they don't affect me. 
---
But then, every now and then, someone decides they want the whole thing anyway. They want to fight for it. They are bigger and stronger than me, and for whatever reason, just taking the resources isn't enough. So we fight it out, in a Fallout game, in a way that no other Fallout game has done it to date. And they are stronger, so I probably lose, even if it is me and 10 turrets vs. a lone gunman. And I have to run, abandon my resources, and try to get by without it. 
---
It's the mother fucking apocalypse, and sometimes it feels like it, in a way no other Fallout has. There aren't towns of friendly people and towns of enemies; there's just the wasteland and sometimes people want to kill you and take what's yours and sometimes people are fine just letting you pass. You really don't know until the gun is smoking or they've moved out of sight.  
---
Not everyone is friendly, and I play like a paranoid hermit. Sometimes I get to a zone and it's been cleared already - well shit that's life. It never seemed to happen in other games, but it feels right. In FO4 it had been like 200 years since the bombs fell when you left the vault. You think any single item will have been left after 200 fucking years? Go put a box of bullets in your back yard. Go put a Kevlar vest in the woods somewhere random. Come back and see what's there in 200 years... absolutely fucking nothing. 
---
This game feels more accurate, and it still has the Fallout atomic charm. There's some bugs, there's some gameplay issues that need to be sorted out. But even though this looks, sounds, and feels like FO3 and FO4, it's dramatically different in a lot of fundamental ways and it may take some time to smooth out. 
---
tl;dr, love this game. All the atomic charm of Fallout, but with a new twist.  
---
I'd like to pickup the Fasnacht balloons. 200caps?
---
&gt; We already have the cryolator stinking up the place where it shouldn't exist.
---
Well, let's be glad, then, that literally nobody ever uses it. 
---
It might be easy to do it once, but Bethesda had a hard enough time keeping this game from being stillborn, if they abort it this late after birth they'll kill the next game with it.
---
Not gonna lie, sometimes I get bored and just crouch walk with my sniper,  just out of normal draw distance and just watch what others are up to.
---
Also sometimes if you move your camp box itself the game thinks it's in a spot that you can't build so it tells you that it's reserved for future content which is a very misleading message
---

You mean the radiation it rains down upon you? 
---
I'm OOTL. Fill me in?
---
I meant the daily challenges my b. My friends and I have never experienced that bug but I’m not discounting that it doesn’t exist.
---
Well this is new news........
---
Yeah it's far better than the current one I use and my character had just hit level 40 so won't be long and only cost 300 caps
---
They were great games for their time, but they don't really hold up now. A rehash of the style would be fine, but I've tried going back several times to 1 and 2 and it's just not the same anymore. 
---
The format is fine, the games are just old as fuck. Standards are higher these days. You release FO76 in the late 90's and people would lose their shit. 
---
Have you seen the amount of alcohol daily challenges lately? I've basically given up on most of those but the drunk naked picture ones can be fun
---
Something I've been asking for since day one: The greenhouse walls and ceilings from Fallout 4. The game models plainly already exist in-game, since we see them used in buildings like the Vault-Tec Agricultural Center. The fact that we can't use them is criminal. Similarly, other building items from Fallout 4: Powered elevators, metal guard-rails for upper floors/balconies, etc. 
---
And perhaps a more ambitious selection: Growable trees. You plant a sapling outside your CAMP, and over the course of a few days, it gradually grows into a towering, leafy tree. If you want, you can cut it down for wood scraps, or just leave it be as a pleasant aesthetic item. 
---
I don't think I installed a single post-install patch to play Fallout games until Bethesda took over.
---
Fo76 never went strong, which is why they’re going back in their word. You don’t make a U turn like this if you have a sustainable player base when it damages your brand as a whole - this is cannibalizing the body to buy time because it’s less harmful than shuttering after 6 months, nothing more.
---
Well, for the attritional fights, the weapon matters less than the set of assassin/sentinel, the chained stealth boys and the jumping up and down. If both players are already doing that, the one with the best stagger chance is likely to win.
---
On the other hand, most battles are probably resolved before one player even sees the other, and you want VATS rifles for that.
---
i have this weird thing where half the time my camp cant be placed but there’s nothing there.

Every game ceo wants money, every game isn’t a nonstop disaster.

Narrator: "but they already were, Bethesda just hadn't clicked the refresh button yet"

Started with Fallout 3...... and kept picking up Bethesda games from then on.
---
A backpack with a fridge mod would be more useful (cough scouts cough) 
---
Fallout: New Vegas is a 9-year-old game. In what world is Bethesda competing with that. 
---
no that's not my argument. media / youtubers  are the ones that will though around the word ptw and that's what people don't like I've seen this kinda stuff destroy games and I wouldn't like my chances with this one.
---
It's going to be an unlockable which means just like everything else in the atom shop it'll be a oen time purchase
---
Maybe full of bottle caps?  Then again, sharp edges..
---
Underrated post right here. 
---
If bethesda has to introduce pay to win items to the atom shop, they are asking for a boycott..
---
Enough said! 
---
As we see it everyone who's contributing, get your arms at the ready for a head to head consumer v corporation war.
---
Bethesda in hindsight has been very lucky to have such a dedicated fanbase. The commercial gamer has no interest in fo76 (source: 90% of fo76 videos on youtube), it is the loyal community members who keep this going for them and ourselves.
---
I personally paid $300 for the game with a helmet and saw the price reduced to $75 in less than a month. If they keep this shit up, I'll see if my lawyer has any ideas. I suggest any other dedicated supporters who feel back stabbed to do the same.
---
Real question tho: How is it an advantage? Nobody PVPs in this game. Like, nobody. I personally hate repairing stuff while I'm halfway across the map so I can't wait to have repair kits.
---
They did state that survival is the way it is currently to test the state of pvp so they can tweak it
---
Make them drop screws and lead while they’re at it..... in all for it 
---
Lol yeah I feel like people wonder what I’m doing when I strip my clothes off and give the thumbs up sign sometimes, especially in the game 😜
---
People have a very short attention span.  Plus, Fallout is a great franchise.  That's why we are here.  That's why people stuck around after the stillborn release of Fallout 76.  Bethesda has done such a good job of making open-world games, that a lot of people don't want to play a different style now.  They buy Fallout 76, feel screwed over, but then remember the 100+ hours of great times they had prior to being screwed over.  Then, they go, "well, I still got my money's worth.  Time to try the new game." You only have to make campaign promises until you win the election.  Bethesda already won the election.
---
I found a Bloodied Harpoon at the Watoga Station once, bought it for like 80 caps. Ever since I've had a whacking stick to farm Watoga and smash mole rats with that's light to carry and cheap to repair. One mans junk is a another man's yadda yadda yadda
---
Ummm wtf
---
Oh look, it’s the argument I was talking about in another comment. The person who sees these as good cause this are convenient and help him skip time wasting. The one who doesn’t understand the reason they are bad is they encourage the developers to start balancing the game to have a lot of time wasting to convince people like you to pay to skip the time wasting. 
---
Think of it this way, you are playing a game that you are paying to skip Playing it. Why are you giving them money for a game you don’t want to play a lot of it?
---
Personally,  I don't really mind that repair kits are gonna be on the atomic shop, they are mainly, in my opinion and from what I've read and gathered up to this point, going to be for those people who forget to regularly check their equipment and repair their equipment. It won't be Pay To Win but pay to be lazy and not gather scrap for a hour. There are junkyard workshops for a reason. 
---
We should totally get more social causes and politics into our games!  What could go wrong?!
---
That’s about what I hear from people whose heads aren’t up BGS’s ass. Hopefully in another 6 months we’ll be at decent game so I can finally enjoy some fallout.
---
Look at me!  I’m virtuous!  I raise awareness!  
---
I just put a second ssd in and am going to switch to it soon just because of this
---
That's why the decreasing number of us that are still here are here, and why the stillborn 76 debacle should have convinced them not to burn the bridges they've slowly been building back.  
---
Going full EA will give them an EA reputation, and Bethesda doesn't have an APex hail mary to save them.  Fans don't come back when they're told to leave.  
---
The casuals you talk of might never go away, but they don't pay the bills and Bethesda can't afford to try and start an entirely new fanbase all over again.
---
Gutsys of the ballistic firing variant are just stupidly op, they rip through some of the best armor in the game, for mirelurk queens, have some poison resist i guess, poison resist is obtainable through legendary armor, temporary poison resist is available through a magazine, you cant obtain poison resist otherwise
---
It exists in the games files so it probably could be added
---
It's a great way to do New Vegas 2 without actually doing New Vegas 2. 
---
Tried today got kicked 4x in less then 4 hours ....
---
Be careful as plague walker makes it agro even if you don't have a disease.  
---
Just another thing that makes me wonder whether the game is set in a simulation.
---
At least it explains so much about how bad the game is.
---
They’re already doing they’re best to destroy the game and millions of people still play it so I don’t think giving them another clickbait title is gonna make much difference. So basically your argument is this game will fail if they don’t keep the atomic shop purely cosmetic? I don’t find that to be believable.
---
Honestly what’s different about this post than the one you posted yesterday? Literally nothing, so maybe you should go post on another forum like twitter or Bethesda.net instead of continuing to live in the echo chamber that seems to be this subreddit rn.
---
I'd suggest trying it to see what you think. I haven't played any other fallout game and I enjoy this a lot. 
---
That is were baby cargo bots come from.
---
Utility may be a p2w issue or it may not. You cannot broadstroke any cashshop utility and simply claim that they are never p2w.
---
There are many people who use Durability perks, perks like White Knight, Gunsmith, Luck of the Draw, Lucky Break. Because if your things break at the wrong time that is still very inconvenient.
---
Now instead i can carry around some Repairkits instead, i can go for perks/build that has more damage focusses perks and worry even less about the durability of my equipment.
---
We don't even know how this will play out with upcomming PvE content, harder, instanced group content. There may be a great need to bring something like Repairkits. We simply cannot trust Bethesda, who is breaking an important promise, to *not* tweak their game in such a way as to make these upcomming p2w elements a mandatory boon.
---
No, I mean it breaking all my workbenches 
---
Dont act like you've never shot a dead body.
---
I just want to say that I hope you are right, and I in no way support pay-to-win video games.  If I did, I'd be building castles on my cellphone.  I've just seen companies shit on their fanbase and profit from it time and time again.  I hope this is different.
---
Someone put classic DOOM on these holotape games as a mod for Fallout 4, however, since no existing Flash port of Fallout 1 exists, it may be much harder. Maybe through DOSBox but I'm not sure if DOSBox has a flash port, and even if it did, who knows what sorts of licensing hoops they'd have to jump through to put DOSBox with Fallout into the game.
---
You wouldn't get a 100 day road map because it would mean you'd have the p2w items out there in the public consciousness for way longer. The hope is to put stuff out quickly, weather the backlash, and repeat. They hope that the people still playing this game will just lap up all this shit and I think they might be right.
---
You're so cool bro. How do you do it? Save some pussy for the rest of us!
---
There is a fix. Connect foundations to them using a ceiling and then another wall and then a foundation on the other wall. Then delete everything starting with the glitch wall.
---
You are defined of quarter there as well if you want to assume stuff all the time get better at it. Also there are a lot of differences and I won't be going anywhere perhaps I might also stalk your reddit page since you decided to do the same.
---
Drop nukes make wat it's fucking fallout. Not some hippie dippy game. Take your green peace pacifier elsewhere
---
Same 
---
I mean, all you'd have to do is have a terminal that automatically boots into the game. 90% of the legwork is done, and creation club even has the cabinets that prove it's doable.
---
Yeah I don't want "God roll" stuff anyway kind of takes the fun out of the game being able to one shot most things.
---
I'm happy with just good stuff
---
I always switch perks and have a mentat, grape if i remember right. It cuts price a couple of hundred caps.
---
Robot yes.
---
Right? I am sick of politics and "WE MUST SAVE THE ENVIRONMENT!" getting shoved down my throat in every direction but the one it should go towards. Just let me play my game and enjoy it for what it is. A game. Quit trying to make everything we do political in nature. I go to games to escape it. Now it seems I can't even do that anymore without someone having to scream "LET'S MAKE THIS ABOUT POLITICS!.  
---
Stupid post. 
---
Sadly all of those things would be immediately called pay2win due to being able to buy storage and this sub would suddenly burst into flames. It’s annoying enough blocking all the spammers as it is, and they’re only dealing with repair kits. I can’t wait for the false equivalencies storage would garner.
---
Lol the games not free to play bud. You have to purchase it you know.
---
How DARE you?! 
---
It’s the current year! 
---
It's just annoying. But I was never sure if I was being robbed. All my weapons display 999.
---
It’s definitely real life. Though, it does look too good to be true!

I'd be cool with this, but any new games they add should be added into the worldspace. Then just make them craftable craftable (perhaps with those blank holotapes that I totally didn't take 100 or so of) at a tinkers bench or something with the atom shop purchase. I'd also be cool if they set up already existing holotape games this way.
---
Bottom line, this is awesome. 
---
We need one to say “thank you”. And maybe a pointing one so you can say “over there” 
---
What everyone is saying is great advice. I’m not going to lie, I run around every vendor/train station collecting junk and then sell it back. Whitesprings has so many pieces of junk, you can pick up items, sell them, and make 200 caps (max you can make a day) in under 10 minutes. 
---
A possible change could be this: 
---
Repairing of weapons and armor with junk you get +15-35% weapon condition but by repairing it with the same weapon/weapon type you get +40-75% 
---
*percentages increase with Jury Rigger perk* 
---
?
---
I read whinning everytime and it physically hurt. He was even corrected by someone with their sarcastic use of 'whinning.' And he still kept running with it. 😂
---
No, but with a claim like "ePiC iS sPyInG oN yOu!" you kind of need more than one redditor to validate it. 
---
Lol nah your little disclaimer at the bottom of your post is hard to forget ain’t nobody stalking pages. 
---
Wdym by “off the quarter”? Never heard that phrase before. You care to tell me what your ultimate premise is then or you just gonna get mad cause I disagree with you and downvote all my past stuff on some childish shit?
---
&gt; Bethesda has an opportunity right now to comment on this issue, let us know the food spoilage rate was a glitch from the patch, and you are working on correcting it. 
---
Their silence on this bothers me, as does the change with fusion cores found in power armor suits. Almost every single one of them is now 25 percent. But the point here is not about fusion cores: it's about transparency. The community went ballistic after stealth nerfs early on, and Bethesda said they would be more transparent in the future.  It looks as though they are not being true to their word.  It looks like more stealth nerfs have been put into the game and they have been silent when confronted about it. 
---
Not really, with cavalier armor the tse is pointless to someone running at you, plus with a melee bloodied build doing 1k+ damage is easy 
---
What controversy are you addressing?
---
There is (or was, i dont actually know if it still exists) a glitch where if you used vats against one of their limbs, it will ignore all of the other armor piece effects and since the head is unprotected, it would basically ignore their entire armor
---
Thing is, I don't think anyone should be angry, but I think people should be talking about this. 
---
It's pretty obvious that the higher ups within gaming companies are making poor decisions based on profit rather than popularity. (You'd think the two would go hand in hand but they seemingly don't understand that.) 
---
It's never a bad thing to call them out. Imagine if we had heard more about how sketchy Telltale execs were with their funds? Who knows? We might of been able to prevent the Telltale devs from getting fired on the spot a week before the health insurance expired. 
---
Or maybe EA and Bioware wouldnt of taken 16 months to make a game 7 years in the making. 
---
Etc etc. It's good to voice your opinions. 
---
Be gone Troll nobody wants you here, I can’t speak for other aspects of your life but if you’re as toxic irl then it’s probably the same sentiment all around.
---
Litterally all I have to do is jump and hot you mid air lmao
---
? 
---
Long =like a month? Are you that easy to manipulate?
---
The fridge was barely mentioned, along with ammo recycling and other things the player base has asked for.  There's no fact or proof of anything other than a couple words in their latest news.  For all we know, it could be a quest reward from the Pioneer Scouts content that's coming up.  Or it could be a 2000 atom shop exclusive.
---
We as players have no idea, other than a brief mention.  Barring the doors, stockpiling tiki torches and sharpening the pitchforks doesn't seem sensible to me.  Let's just relax and see what happens.  If we start seeing all kinds of pay-to-win junk in the shop, I'll take up arms with you.  I'd rather give "the enemy" a chance to speak on their own behalf first.
---
Tses barely do damage anymore, and to someone with cavalier plus a bloodied melee goodluck just jumping lol
---
No it doesnt, I been saying for a long time, Fallout isnt real, it is simply a sim. Lore even suggest it could be. Make note that technology is stuck in late 40's and early 50's. Also, in our Universe using Sims like this was an idea just after WWII. It never happened, though people were considering it. My idea, though, is different from his. 
---
It is a Simulation, it takes place just after WWII. People were afraid and fearful of being Nuked by Russia. China was having issues. Reason Fallout is stuck  in a permanent period because people in Sim remember that period. 
---
I also disagree with you, Fallout Lore suggests such took place, we see it many times and even are in two during Fallout 3 and a DLC. Which proves it was possible. My only issue, when did these people get inside Sim. Before or afterwards a great war. I say before, because you have Aliens, Lasers, Robots, and autos that simply came from a 40's / 50's type story. I've felt Fallout was a Sim since Fallout 2. Evidence is there in all those games if you look.
---
Means far off like thats assumption of me down voting your stuff or the assumption that you think I'm mad. and the note at the bottom talks about spelling stuffs nothing to do with past posts by me.
---
I haven’t played for 24 hours. Wtf is the repair kit 
---
Pretty much same with me.  Playing since fo1.  Multiple owned copies of 3 and NV on pc and Xbox.  3 is my all time favorite, 4 is my favorite for combat, and 76 is my favorite for exploring and playing with friends.
---
Huh, well, if that works i'll be happy to be proven wrong, gotta try it out i guess. 
---
I agree, it doesn't sit well with me at all. Advantages to in game content that is paid for or suffer a severe disadvantage in game is ridiculous. 
---
Oh shot I meant to reply to the op post lol I'm melee and all I have to do it jump too these TSE weilders are fuckin idiots who can't aim in the first place who rely on explosive splash damage
---
also wtf is a premise this is no fancy message or something its just like some quick easy slang
---
Don't even humour him, ignore him and he'll go away. (Quick little profile check and his only posts on this sub are saying the same as he put above)
---
Look... if we save the Environment then Fallout 76 (or the other ones for what it matters) may not happen and I just can't take that risk. I deserve my chance to live in a post apocalyptic world, don't I?
---
I played *Wasteland* on my C64 back in -88 I think, also by Interplay, loved it, was my favourite game in those years. When Interplay came out with *Fallout* in -97 it was a dream come true. Not really a sequel, but much of the same style in many ways. Loved the *Fallout* games ever since and played them all. It was made even more fantastic by the Doctor Who reference in *Fallout*, which was my other big love at the time.
---
Ive been reading the description on the Roadmap they gave us. The way it's worded I think it'll be something like tokens given for scrapping legendaries and using X amount of tokens to buy a specific legendary item. Think items like Crushing Blow or Medical Malpractice but bought from a vendor. I do not believe we will be able to mod our own legendaries items.
---
I will in a pinch, but I hate that it’s dog food my avatar is eating lol
---
Ranged Stealth bonus damage has always been a Fallout/Bethesda feature, no reason why a Multiplayer title would strip that away when stealth is a key part of the game.
---
That’s why I go AA/TK, and say g’bye to your armor values.
---
That sounds much more reasonable then my silly idea indeed. I just wish Bethesda would give us a way to do mutually agreed playerduells without triggering a Bounty.
---
Considering that Fallout is a post-apocalyptic game world filled with tongue-in-cheek political and social satire, the unintentional irony in a lot of these comments is astonishing funny.  Great stuff.
---
Yes it is possible to one shot in survival. Way easier to do so in survival than adventure actually. 
---
There’s a behemoth that usually spawns in a small lake kinda near west-tek, think it’s called Solomon’s pond
---
This stuff always starts with something fairly low impact. Trust me this is only the start if fans let it slide.
---
People have been buying up low level legendary weapons for this exact thing, could be he has a bloodied explosive and a head shot will be all he needs
---
Nah 
---
They show up sometimes on the Watoga vendor bot.  Maybe Phoenix and Harper's Ferry, but I got mine at Watgoa.
---
I’m saying I recognized it from your past post since you accused me of staking you, nobody else includes stuff like that. 
---
A premise is what you should have if you’re gonna try to tell people what to do, something to back up your argument so you don’t get called out for posting something that is without merit. You obviously don’t have a premise to your argument or can’t even understand what you’re trying to say yourself. Just a big old word salad.
---
Based on what you pat d Bethesda is ruining their PR image by including non cosmetic stuff in the atomic shop and this is gonna cause you tubers and journalists to create negative content.  Newsflash sweetie, they already do! Doesn’t matter what Bethesda does people just love to hate this game ok the same way you seem to love to make posts without being able to defend any of your claims. 
---
How tf is a repair kit "pay to win"? You think you are about to use a repair kit in the middle of PvP?
---
I'd be into some Free States or Responder themed items.  Live Free or Die.
---
I actually have my bar the Oak Ox set up right next to Billings for that reason. Corn, grain, and a good amount of snaptail reeds. Need the neon letters so I can rename it to the sloshed sloth.
---
Very slightly off-topic, but I have two questions that I'll bet the readers of this post can answer for me:
---
1. What does "condition cost" refer to? 
---
2. I can't figure out the linkage between my STASH and the fermenter, nor the use of the marking system. Obviously it's not a workaround to defeat total STASH limits and there's some dynamic linkage. But why does the damned thing still show beverages that I've taken out and put into my STASH?
---
Thanks in advance.
---
&gt; Dont get me wrong, I love the idea of fridges, but to increase the spoilage rate to make us NEED a fridge is shady as hell... 
---
What'd be worse is if the fridges make the food last as long as the pre-nerfed food.
---
We'll see if the change to food spoilage was intentional or not over the next patch or two. Given that it wasn't fixed in the last one gives me pause.
---
Well I would say the overlying issue with the ammo system is that it doesn't take into account for the weapon you are using for balancing ammo crafting.
---
\*salute\*
---
I encountered a jumper yesterday. Definitely a good strat against melee, but also can be predictable if you notice it. Drop vats and power hit them on their landing.
---
The last point. How I roll in Survival. Farm squirrels for a crit; save for a player. AA\TK/superior penetration to negate armor. One-shot head crits from a good distance away, and Concentrated Fire if they manage to live for 95% Ac follow-ups.
---
&gt;simulation
---
Problem, Simulations are part of Fallout Lore. So, it has to be accepted as a possibility. We even are in them during Fallout 3. And since, Fallout 76 is Fallout canon...guess what...? It also explains one character, Dogmeat. Who is in all of the mainline games. I have thought Dogmeat means something in Fallout...like a hidden secret.
---
As a super casual but enthusiastic player that always seems way behind everyone else (regardless of the hours I’ve put in), I think what you’re offering is so cool. I’m sure it’s easy for many to pish-posh your sentiment, but people like you are why I stuck with the game and love this sub so much. 
---
I try not to feed the animals at the zoo but it’s hard not to feel bad for some that are trapped inside their echo chamber cage rolling in the crap they spew on the daily. Makes you wanna set them free but then you realize they wouldn’t know how to live a normal life only be a worthless troll. 
---
Smexy!
---
If they ever decide to implement seasons in survival mode (like in Diablo and other aRPG) then we at least won't have to deal with dupes and potentially PvP will feel fair(ier). Right now I think it is only worth for weekly reward and double XP events.
---
&gt; a pve build in power armor is a recipe for losing caps and aid.
---
So is virtually every armor in the game. Yeah I've easily killed people in PA but I've easily killed people in just about every other armor you can name except Sentinel Assassins.   Virtually everyone on here claims to have a full set,  but that's mostly bullshit. 
---
Exactly what i do my man. Been doing the same on my level 22 in survival, just build crit and pop when you see someone, it's GG. You can take 2/3v1's with it if you're careful enough it's mad fun.
---
What are Crushing Blow and Medical Malpractice?
---
Even better when you work in a pair, as snipers should 😎 
---
Glad to see the VATS-society alive and poppin heads 
---
They will most likely defend themselves if content similar to this is added and  I assumed that you were stalking my profile because I don't talk about my past posts in this one as someone with keyboard fingers like you would've written paragraphs on my old post.
---
As A chef I second and third this.
---
I knew griefers and similar lowlife fucks would ruin the game the moment FO76 being a multiplayer game was announced.
---
&gt;Generally speaking though, yes. PA is inviting death in PVP. 
---
I haven't seen any armor that people aren't easily killed in with the right weapons. 
---
They sent give a fuck.
---
I didnt believe it before but every month that goes by I really believe this whole game was a cash grab.
---
I love this game but they just really dont seem to care.
---
I've played Fallout games since 1 in the 90s and have bought Atoms. They dont care about my oppinion though and that's been made clear.
---
Games already dead... maybe in a few months it’ll be brought back to life
---
If you're on xbox i'd gladly team up with you when my guy's fully levelled haha. We could rule the world 😉
---
It's the worst. Best solution is to have the Marsupial mutation. Can easily jump high enough.
---
Don't have it on my alt yet though. you basically have to be right underneath it and jump, right at the top of the jump I can usually get a cursor. Takes some hopping to clear a pretty full upper box. It happens though.
---
GT: TheGr8Nekodamus 
---
Perhaps you should muster up the courage to make your own post and when people have a different opinion you can type up a whole book with perfect grammer there too if I could I would do something a lot more productive with those skills.
---
I’ll keep ya covered 😝 
---
Haha my man! I'll add once i've been the shop, - idezarc 
---
Right?! This is exactly what I was thinking! 
---
I feel like the cooking mechanics have largely been ignored, there are tons of perk cards associated with staving off hunger, can we get some to increase the effect of more complicated recipes or a budget chef one that uses less ingredients and more wood(filler) but make them less effective.
---
Can'r wait to unlock Fireproof and Adamantium Skeleton, i feel like that's the only thing killing me at this point is the damn Explosive weapons, can't wait to move mine over haha.
---
You make no sense to me so it’s useless trying to understand what your trying to convey. A simple post about not wanting these items in the atomic shop would make sense but I wanted to understand what your jumbled word salad of a post was supposed to mean, I still don’t know but it seems like you don’t either so whatever. 
---
Don’t assume people are stalking you when you make yourself stand out with disclaimers at the end Of your posts, some people have good memories like me but hopefully I can forget everything you’ve said because it’s causing me to make less sense by the minute. 
---
New Vegas is my favorite but I don't see you as a monster :) 
---
They already have bottle caps from time to time. It would be fun to see plastic and aluminium cans and glass shards on them. Any gun user wouldn't mind the extra aluminum either
---
Thanks for the info, guess I have to go get mutated finally.
---
Scaling works differently in Survival, it's more "true damage" than in Adventure mode
---
Yes my post is messy I already know that either you can't read too or you are attempting to get a rase on me pointing out my disorders
---
Generally speaking, “pay to win” is often referred to as anything a player can buy to gain an advantage over another player or anything that would allow a player to skip work and time by using real money. If you want to take it more literally, this whole repair kit thing, if realized, sets a precedent for Bethesda to dive deeper into this non-cosmic Atom Shop items hole. That’s where my concern lies.
---
The rewards given from the Survival mode weekly challenge. 2-3* predetermined legendary items. The vendor will probably have a list of weapons/armor thats all 2-3* legendary items.
---
Or you will be able to buy a token for a gear slot. Like buy a Shotgun token or Left Leg token. It's a guaranteed 3* item, but with random affixes/type. Akin to Diablo 3 or World of Warcrafts token system from the end of Legion.
---
also please point out where I talk about my old post because I can't see it in there.
---
Nerfs are definitely coming though.  The developers even said so in a recent interview if you listened closely.  It was their entire reason for allowing existing, high- level players in the game.  He said they wanted to see how badly they could break the game with extreme builds and legendary armor so they could 'fix it.'
---
No way??? A company that cares more about money than their customers?? No such  company exists! Wake up please
---

Hi my IGN is unknownhacker72, sorry I wasn't able to get back to you sooner. Did you manage to finish the quest? I just added you.
---
And avoid public spawn points, spawn killing's rampant
---
I always just assumed they starved to death or died from dehydration. It they survived the blast, they couldn't leave for years or the radiation would have been fatal. 
---
It can make for some fun times in PvE, I will say that. But stealth is something that really can’t be done well in a multiplayer environment. Especially with how bare bones the stealth system is in Bethesda games. It doesn’t make sense for someone to have a 2.5 “stealth” bonus if I started the engagement and shot them a few times right before they did. 
---
It should go without saying that humans are a lot different then the AI that controls your favorite mutant. The AI is basically ran off of an algorithm of your agility + other boosts = your stealthiness. And then your stealthiness just needs to be better then their perception. Humans don’t run off of numbers and stats, and so I am clearly able to see that weirdo over there squatting in the well lit corner...
---
Uhh no ones calling you out for any claimed disorders, I’ve called you argument hogwash imo but that’s just a part of posting something that’s controversial, people will disagree with you. No ones gotten personal because I prefer to attack ideas and not people, unfortunately you’re incapable of defending the ideas you presented so it’s meaningless to even converse with you. 
---
Your vote has been tallied, only non cosmetic items in the atomic shop , good to know. Moving on now.
---
Maybe add a perk icon that shows which perks affect them and if you have the one equipped.
---
Between the unfixed food spoilage, the loss of trade window item inspection and return to a lack of communication, I'm guessing the Dev team has all hand on deck trying to push out the ambitious amount of new content.  It reminds me of November/December.  I'm thinking the team is being pushed hard to churn out content that's as bug free and functional as possible upon initial launch.  They're already had a minor delay on the brewing system and the player vending is getting pushed back as well.
---
I'm guessing they're going really hard on upcoming content and have the relatively small quality of life bugs on the side burners.  The player base can play relatively normally with increased food spoilage and such.  Maybe they're encountering issues with the backpack system, dungeon raids or some other functionality that requires a lot of attention.
---
It's also been a couple weeks since we've had a new patch, so I'm thinking the issues brought up in the brewing update will be addressed when Lying Lowe hits.
---
If I see a 3 star item in a vendor's list, I just buy it.  It's pretty easy to see if there's a stat boost, poison or rad resist second effect just by looking at the item properties.  The third effect list is pretty limited, so it's likely going to be some kind of weight reduction effect.  Even if the piece sucks, I pop an ultra-light mod on it, throw it in the stash and let it wait for legendary vending.
---
I'm betting it was a crit too if i'm honest
---
Do my eyes deceive me? A none repair kit post? What is this sorcery?!
---
Unrelated note, does that “first shot does double damage” legendary effect from fallout 4 still exist in 76?
---
Its an item that will be able to 100% repair a gun or an armor piece. The standard repair kit will only be available on the Atom Shop and the “advanced” version will repair said items to 150% and will be dropped very rarely in the world (like on the scorchbeast queen).
---
moving on now are so your avoiding the part where I asked you point out where I talked about my old post
---
I completed the rad shield quest and they spawn for me. I guess the spawning criteria is a mystery but it is possible.   
---
I hear they only spawn at night so try loading the zone when it is dark.  
---
maybe bethesda won't receive any cash from me if the kit purchase by atom go live. But actually, there will have someone buy it.   
---
I want make this as Endgame meme.
---
Also one of the best perks, so you'll want it anyway.
---
 You make no sense to me so it’s useless trying to understand what your trying to convey. A simple post about not wanting these items in the atomic shop would make sense but I wanted to understand what your jumbled word salad of a post &lt; this here is the part bringing up how my post is typed out not content so you are calling me out or can't read a noted part.
---
The substation north of Watoga always spawns a death claw. The bridge northeast of Harper's Ferry almost always has a hermit crab. 
---
200 times? Sounds like you are cursed by the RNG-gods. Don't tell me you are not at Charleston station, it is so much easier to get him to spawn down the road west of Lady Janet's Soft Serve, just pass the buss. I usually get him in just a few jumps there.
---
Never seen him aggro though, you are not running Plague Walker mutation, are you?
---
You made Weapon Kits in NV with Hammers, Duct Tape, etc, so you could fix your shit if you didn't have the right spares for repairs.
---
You could also buy them from shops.
---
Yeah, 76's will be implemented differently, but NV still had Repair Kits.
---
Bethesda pretty much ignores New Vegas's existence so I doubt we'll see any New Vegas inspired cosmetics unfortunately.
---
Thanks. But, what do you mean by "none repair kit"? I guess I've missed something that's happened recently (?). 
---
Lmao
---
You can try to move your camp (and place from storage, not blueprint) to avoid the material cost.
---
But, certain "Buildings" can't be replaced if stored, not sure what triggers it though.
---
When the fuck are they gonna support crossover play? I have all of these for you, on XB1... 😑
---
When I find him occasionally I like to use the flare gun to alert any players nearby to his location.
---
Instigating? I'm sure it does BUT it requires the target to be on full health to get the double damage proc
---
I read your other post yesterday and it was basically the same thing that’s why I asked to the merit of posting the same thing multiple times? If you’re trying to get Bethesda’s attention then a more direct approach would make more sense than clogging the feed with meaningless copy and paste posts. I recognized you were the same person because nobody else puts a disclaimer at the bottom of their posts, it sticks out and yet you wanna think you’re worth stalking? Nah not original enough for me.
---
I think the ships sailed on the environmental impact of plastic in the fallout world. It's a nuclear wasteland. Plastic is the least of its issues. 
---
All the devs are silence right now, i think they have an order to do that. In conclusion, the future of loot boxes are coming.  
---
   
---
Guess what, i'm continue playing old fallout shit and won't purchase any betheda product related to fallout 76 until they get to know pay2win in a average price paid-game environment is bad.  
---
Dear Betheda, Fallout 76 is not a free game.
---
If I wanted to be stalked I would put up photos of my self that sounds like a standard defence line.
---
I think repair kits will be fine if they cost like 10 atoms so you can get one from a daily task completion I would prefer if  they didn't cost atoms but if Bethesda does need another means of revenue its the best option. 
---
You bring, the ingredients I will make them for you
---
&gt;Comment deleted by userjust now
---
Jesus that last part sounds like you do it often you grade the people you stalk or something this is to much for me I'm out of here  .
---
Well it’s true, sorry if that makes you feel bad but when I respectfully try to engage you on your post to understand it and you deflect you make it worse for yourself. If someone asks for clarification then it’s best practice to provide it or else people will believe you don’t care about conveying anything and just want to ramble on. 
---
Where da Pint-Sized Slasher at 
---
Yep, jackwagons galore, they have consequences in the pvp server so they skulk over to the adventure side 
---
As a non-US player, past experience has taught me not to express any form of wish, idea or sentiment of a Fallout Game based outside the USA...
---
That being said, Queen Liz as a Reptile Mutant would be worth it.
---
mmmm salty tears
---
I don’t understand why people think it makes it pay to win, it gives you literally no advantage in combat whatsoever
---
Ok
---
But hey, at least nobody is talking about how they pushed player vending back A MONTH ;)
---
People on the internet want something to bitch about sooo badly. It's sad af.
---
Nobody tell him. He lives in ignorant bliss. 
---
Are you really in a position to be trolling people?
---
They try to make you feel bad for calling them out too but it’s annoying when people act like they speak on behalf of the entire community. I simply want it notated that I do not agree and like to point out flaws in people’s arguments even tho I usually steel man them first. Everyone’s entitled to their own opinion but there’s a better way to go about it then the obvious karma begging that’s going on rn.
---
All they had to do was release a handmade skin when everyone and their mother had a TSE and they would have probably made a million bucks in a day
---
It's the thought of it leading to other things, and the extra resources a person who uses them will have (some things are balanced based on their cost to maintain)
---
Gotta read this in Joey Diaz’s voice.. ya filthy Cocksuckas!!
---
I paid for this game. Without me paying I would not have the opportunity to win. Therefore it's pay to win. The logic checks out. We can shut down the internet now. 
---
I actually enjoy being an asshole to whiny folks on the internet, who have nothing better to do than bitch about pointless shit. So, bring it on :)
---
You on XB1 my dude? I’ll donate materials to the cause, help me clear this stash box bruh
---
Shit I almost bought that spell skin twice. 
---
I had the same issue. Turns out my tv setting was set to overscan so I turned it off and now the game fits the screen perfectly 
---
Oh yeah, I remember the tea being classes as alcohol  :o thanks for the reminder :D 
---
Soooo make another game?
---
I got it on sale for $35 on the Bethesda website, does that mean you win cause you paid more?
---
I think so.
---
Yes that's right. Cross platform is also something they've said isn't planned for anytime soon.
---
Yeah I get you. And by now everyone’s point has been made
---
Oh damn, this one goes to 11 everybody watch out!
---
Just get an ultralight. 
---
You can find them at night at the same area that the quest has you pick them along the river. It's not always guaranteed that they'll be there, so either hop servers or simply wait until it's night on your current server and check. There's at least 5 blooms and you can get up to 10 with Green Thumb. 
---
If needed why not.. some mobile games done sky high recently.. why not contribute to fallout franchise with that option?
---
Clearly you’ve never dealt with someone using an instigating explosive shot gun and stealth boys/Chameleon, tse autos are the only way to deal with them. Fucker kept finding me after I would respawn and drained my caps
---
I win morer.
---
I love this game too 
---
One great point you made is the adjustment to White Knight to put it "in line" with Power Patcher.  I have a stealth sniper and a T-51b slugger, both in the lvl 160-175 range.  The sniper rarely gets hit, but the melee gets surrounded by mobs and hammered on regularly.  He lives in his power armor, unless I have to make food, craft or want to sleep while going afk.  I've repaired a power armor piece maybe 3-4 times ever.  Easily less than a handful.  My sniper usually has to fix a piece of armor once or twice a week, mainly from scorchbeast scream attacks.  They both the same rank of armor durability perks.  
---
To be brought "in-line" with the durability of power armor, White Knight should be 30/60/90%.  All three ranks would probably still only be equal to 1 rank of Power Patcher.
---
I would pay real money for cannibal themed clothing, give me a face hat!
---
Yeah you’re right it’s fear mongering 101 fueled by clickbaity youtubers that’s copy pasted non stop. Your arguments are invalid and even when granted apply to less than 1% of the community, that being the hardcore PvP players who have some semblance of a position but is still found to be shaky upon further examination.
---
Isn't it already a mess from the day it came out?
---
They know it will... But they also lots of morons will buy these. 
---
Hey mods, i think its cool how much you're responding to people. I do think repair kits were a nice idea at their core, but like everybody else is saying, atom shop isn't the best approach. Do you know if Bethesda is going to try a new approach, if not, have they at least gotten the news?
---
no u
---
Still holding him?
---
If so please add me, ign apobestea
---
I honestly feel that a lot of flavour could be added by making guns have different receivers, like the syringer, but with explosive, acid, fire or ice effects, kinda like borderlands, but craft able at a weapons bench, maybe under science perks.
---
This would also add utility to rockets and grenade launchers, crossbows could have grappling hooks, and could be used as a way to buff energy weapons.
---
Different ammo types sound cool, but it would also increase carry weight. A different receiver would hopefully be easier to implement and not such a burden as adding more ammo drops to containers and enemies.
---
We already have prime receivers that require special ammo, which is a start, but the ammo crafting requirements are absurd and not totally worth the cost in a lot of cases. 
---
Be glad nobody’s running a Rads spec yet!
---
Get Woodchucker from the luck perks, and go to Helvetia and Sylvie and Sons logging camp (near the Sons of Dane compound, east). Helvetia has a yellow building that you can see immediately upon traveling there. The logging camp has a stupid amount of firewood piles. Total combined wood is easily 500+.
---
I would love player skins that let you look like ghouls, scorched, or even supernatant for power armor.
---
When I first heard they were doing a fallout style MMO I was really hoping it to be in the far far future. And you'd be able to choose a player race from, super mutant, ghoul, synth, or human.
---
They could even add cosmetic stuff like what gen synth you are, feral/nonferal/charred/ glowing one ghoul.
---
Each race could have different downsides like muties being real stronk but dum, synths could be smart but ultimately fragile, ghouls fast and rad inducing but squishy, humans are boring people that most unfun people would choose.
---
If I can't have that I'd love to get some skins that make my dude look like a ghoul, scorched, or even a wendigo(and not the weird PA issue)
---
So those people are your repair kits?
---
Heh. I've seen a few, Rad-X an Radaway will be my babe's when they're out in force! (This is why i have a Gamma Gun) xD
---
Pay to win just means you can pay and gain an advantage over other players who didn't pay. I don't like your new "true definition" you just made up here. 
---
Damn plastic
---
People don't like to feel like they're at a disadvantage when playing with or against other players, this is why people don't like this kind of thing in coop games.
---
It's not fear mongering, it's legitimate concerns/complaints (in this case at least, there are probably people who do fear monger but putting everyone there is disingenuous) 
---
Simply stating "your arguments are invalid" doesn't make them so, but I'm glad you have an opinion.
---
Add to that I'm not even on a side of this argument, I'm just explaining why people may dislike it, I get that you may be frustrated but that was a tad aggressive.
---
Don't kink shame me!
---
They have 2 mobile games. Blades and fallout shelter and a F4 companion app. 
---
Oh you mean for pvp, I'm a melee boy and I get hit by deathclaws, mole rates, and ghouls midair all the time
---
I feel sorry for you losing your camp that you put time and effort into, that’s why as mass amount of players are going around purging scum like these so this game can be enjoyable.
---
That’s radioactive! 😛
---
Thanks for inviting.
---
Needed to make them feel bad, I'm sure it didn't work. Could care less.
---
Why don't you go search for more berets? Go play dress up some more?
---
I'm not trolling anyone. Losses happen in online games, and people who throw excessive tantrums over them get mocked. That's how it is.
---
Haven't been playing them since the release of Fo1, but i started on fo3 played the shit out of it then moved to the older titles. Ever since, fallout has been a staple must buy for me. Ive been big on mmos since 2001 , so when they revealed that it was one. I was excited for it. (This might be why i don't personally care about non-cosmetic in the atom shop. ) 
---
Was a bit disappointed at launch, but it got better. Now I'm just waiting on new end game content, i might make another character. 
---
***ahem***

One word
---
r/gamingcirclejerk
---
You just suck at video games.
---
Okay “those arguments are invalid” is that better? You were presenting the ideas tho so that’s why I said it. 
---
The problem with the argument is there is no advantage to it when you can purchase them via currency you earn in game and find even better ones by playing normally. This is a quality of life addition not something that’s pay to win, and to claim that it’s gonna lead to legendaries or permanent buffs being sold in the atomic shop is fear mongering.
---
Couldn’t they just adapt the fallout 4 companion app to work with 76 instead of making a whole new app?
---
&gt; *Some of us like this subreddit, and like actual information/posts.*
---
lol, learn to google your information you zoomer, instead of waiting for people to spoonfeed you. 
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; *Shut the hell up and just play the game, you crybaby.*
---
its a fucking forum, people discuss  shit here you dumbass.
---
I just want weapons that allow me to point at my enemies and make them dead without having to pull a trigger or swing anything. 
---
Since FO3. Had over 1000 hours each in that, FNV AND FO4. Went back and played FO1 too. Haven't gotten around to 2 or... the one we don't speak of.
---
Let's start at a dollar a pound  ;)
---
The power station just north of Watoga always has(for me) a lvl 91 glowing deathclaw or lvl 91 alpha deathclaw
---
I should read the comments, someone beat me to it.
---
This was literally the point all along. If they'd handled the release better we would've had non-cosmetics in the store ages ago. These sort of games are being made and sold as a service where they screw a small number of players out of huge amounts of money - it literally doesnt matter if the majority of the player base doesnt like it. They've just been waiting until some of the heat died off before doing this.
---
You mad? You seem mad.
---
Decent point on items cycling out, but Pay to Win is the _ability to buy an advantage over others_. Personally, at level 110 or so, I have neither used white Knight (I saw another post moaning about that being nerfed to make repair kits necessary), nor have I ever encountered a single time I was unable to repair my weapons or armour. I used Luck of the Draw but not Lucky Break. I don't personally have an issue with them selling repair kits unless implemented in a way that forces people to buy them for real cash and it doesn't sound like they have. It's a massive dick move to break the 'cosmetics only' promise though. 
---
BTW it's "slippery slope", not "slippery soap". Although soap can indeed be slippery, the saying refers to a slippery slope as in a descent down a path that leads to similar but often worse behaviour. Selling repair kits? Why not sell power cores? Selling power cores? Why not sell alcohol recipes or early Biv resets? Selling alcohol recipes? Why not sell legendary weapons with custom perks? Etc, etc... Yeah that last one was perhaps an unrealistic leap but you get the idea I'm sure. Nice /r/boneappletea though - not heard this misunderstanding before :)
---
Agreed
---
Yeah? When?
---
Genius! :D
---
Did you wait for a little bit? Sometimes you have to go to a different area of whitesprings then return back and it should turn into a meat pile then it becomes lootable
---
How much is required to fix the whole camp? 
---
It will have turned into a bloodied mess on the floor, they do that when there is too many bodies lying around. Don't worry too much, two shot ain't that good these days.
---
Same here. 
---
So sorry if I see him I'll try to buy extra plans
---
I want a necklace of eyeballs.
---
"im sick of politics in my games!!!!!"
---
\- player of game in which the entire premise is politics and political satire
---
A hat . it's a random plan near new Gad on the corpse of a reenactor.  
---
What if they made a phone app and holotape games in the same time, and you could play holotape games from your phone?
---
Not better, same problem there. No explanation, just a statement.
---
To claim that is a slippery slope fallacy, to say it may lead to that is a legitimate concern (IMO)
---
You can't find advanced kits, they're rewards for specific in game activities (like killing the biggest bat), no mention of how common they will be (important), and the basic form is only purchasable.
---
They've already "sold" temporary buffs, for some people this is just another step towards MTX they disagree with, plus it's that same broken promise.
---
The way a mechanic feels is also a large part of it, though it remains to be seen/tried since it hasn't been released yet, as such judgements on it should be withheld, doesn't mean people can't express discontent with it or where they think it may lead.
---
Couldn't agree more.
---
You are prob right but you would think the charged the customers 60 bucks for a game worth about 10 bucks when it was launched and I would think they would like to win back it's customers before going o we fucked you guys over but you will have to spend more money if you want it to play better. 
---
Ah nothing says “environmental awareness” like saving the 100 year old fallout and radiation mutated animal and vegetation!
---
Fucking this. Perfectly said.
---
No one said this is just the start of things to come, it's just assumed. Fuck outta here with assumptions. 
---
To be honest, this doesn't bother me that much. I can understand why it bothers others though, as it directly violates their promise of only selling cosmetics (which they've already broken once).
---
Let me elaborate why it doesn't bother me that much. Seeing as you can earn them from killing the scorched queen, an event that is marred with the opportunity of breaking your weapons (due to an insane amount of health) it's fitting to get rewarded with a free repair. This is ok with me, as long as it doesn't take away from her previous rewards. However, only feet away from the site you fight her is a workbench for both armor and weapons, where you can repair your weapons. So it's like use it if you want, or don't. I don't really care.
---
Secondly, the fact that it repairs to a condition of 150% is not really OP. I would say it under-performs, as you can -easily- equip perk cards to repair to 200% at a workbench (both armor and weapons). I use this all the time myself. I would still do this even with the repairkit out. Why? Because you can only repair once you break the 100% barrier and below on an item, not above. And the difference from 150-200% mean some increase in damage (Damage output on weapons scale upwards from 100 to 200% of weapon durability) So locking yourself in at 150% removes some bonus damage, and isn't really worth the "free" repair in my eyes, seeing as you only save materials, but at the cost of less damage output.
---
As for the normal repair kits, these are more lucrative in my eyes, as they put you at that threshold of 100% condition, only needing a few uses until you have the chance to manually repair again to 200%. This means in the Queen fight, you'll be back to firing your weapons, if it breaks mid-battle, but after the fight is over you can go repair it back to 200% again. This is more lucrative in my eyes.
---
I have been focusing mainly on the end-game here, and with good reason. This is really the only point in the game where I find myself breaking weapons mid-battle and it being an inconvenience to me. Every other time a weapon breaks, it's while fighting a few overcomeable enemies where you can simply go repair soon after it happens. I can't think of any other situation where a repair kit is really -needed- other than the Queen fight, seeing how long it is. There might be more fights like this coming in the near future, and the possibility of vault delves being long and without a workbench (which I doubt personally) where it might be handy with a repair kit. 
---
I hope this bring some light as to why it might not be AS horrible of a prospect as some people make it out to be, practically. Theoretically, I can understand why it bothers people. However, I don't think all the outrage comes from people who play this every single day, and knows the in's and out's of the game, and how to work around the idea of breaking items. It's a principle thing, I get it. They said they won't, and they did add non-cosmetics. And for that I agree, it's scummy. However, I play and love this game, and I try to look at it in a practical light. And to me it's a "meh" item. I might use it, I most likely won't. I sure as hell won't buy it myself. And if it adds weight to my already struggling inventory, I might just end up destroying them (If I can lol). My two cents :)
---
As a man who needs more plastic I second this environmentally destructive post.
---
True. It's out there, honestly days like today with "gather 50 times" are even more annoying. it's just a lot, all combined, for pennies. It's not enjoyable, and it's not worth doing...for me. 
---
You must not have watched the recent panel discussion at ‘Bethesda Game Days’. 
---
They specifically stated that Reddit is the best place for leaving feedback.
---
Started with 2, then tactics, 3, NV, 4, remembered I'd never gotten around to 1 because I played 2 so many times, so played through it last year.
---
Bos arms plan?
---
Yup. I've also only seen one x-01 shock, two jetpacks, and a bare smattering of 3 star legendary mobs, none of which weren't trash. RNG gods fucking hate me. 
---
And yeah I am. Is this _another_ fun bethesda bug? 
---
Thats...fucked. 
---
I'm pretty sure I have adjusted my TV but just incase can you explain to me what your talking about.
---
Waaaaaah
---
Waaah
---
Oh. My. Stars. The nuke zones. Nukes should ABSOLUTELY destroy buildings. Subsequent nukes should destroy them more. Degrade would be a better word, actually, but as long as a server is up, nuclear bombs should further degrade map locations to the point of not being able to enter them.
---
Maybe all the radiation spawns bigger, badder enemies...
---
The new endgame is wiping out hundreds of bloated glowing gangrenous behemoths riding scorchbeast empresses.
---
No it's a Panasonic I have tried everything I know to do.
---
Yes. I thought they were pulled from a few patches ago. 
---
Fallout really lays hardest into McCarthyism and other social and socio-economic issues of the mid-century..  For one great example, go to Orwell Orchards and read/listen to what you can find there.  I'm sure the name Orwell Orchards is not an accident.  I'm honestly surprised there's not more backlash against the amount of notes/tapes regarding the "normality" of same-sex relationships, a feature of Fallout that's been in place since the first title.
---
I feel like they had a meeting the other day.  Someone spoke up and was like "So hear me out... Any press is better than no press.  Anthem has taken over as the game to dislike and we're not even mentioned.  I have a GREAT idea to get our name out there again..."
---
Eh, if you know about those locations, collecting wood 50 times is pretty trivial. I don't like gathering all the materials to make 50 alcohol either though. And yes, it sucks tremendously that none of the alcohol sells for more than a single fucking cap. Pretty bullshit.
---
Lol bruh wdym no explanation? The fact that these can be purchased with currency earned in game and found, rewarded, whatever semantic games you wanna play, means it’s not pay to win. This system encourages people to play the game longer and earn more points/complete more events/kill more boss enemies to receive a better item than what can be bought. 
---
You can claim the slippery slope fallacy all you want but it’s not a good point to make imo because the community is WOKE on these issues. No ones gonna let Bethesda slide into the P2W DMs. 
---
Absolutely people are allowed to express discontent but shouldn’t get all defensive when they’re called out for using scare tactics to reinforce their points and making invalid points like having extra resources. I’m constantly throwing resources away because I don’t have the space, maintaining your gear is easy and should be made harder for a survival game imo. These repair kits provide no P2W incentive when you look at all the variables and to claim otherwise is simply untrue, it’s all right to hold hat opinion but it’s also alright for me to call BS on it plain and simple.
---
In the display settings where it shows you picture size, sometimes there’s an option called “overscan” which if on zooms in on the picture. I turned mine off and it solved the problem 
---
Also, when you do the bar-thing make sure to set up a field of razorgrain nearby to fee your everhungry brewery.
---
Thank you I will check that. 
---
A spoilage fix that worked for me (once, yesterday). When I put fermentable whiskey in the fermenter I noticed my food spoiling fast! I logged out and back in then the food that was almost spoiled was back to normal condition. Like I said, only tried it once.
---
I have the exact same issue with blackwater brew. I've tried everything over the last few days. It sucks that I can't get other quests.
---
wrong, high level repair kits will not be available from the atom shop, only through gameplay. 
---
Holy smokes, youre a lucky duck
---
No they don't. PoE is as much an MMO as FO76... But that aside FO76 isn't an mmo, its a looter shooter. We do have a respec mechanic, and yes it's a full respec mechanic. It just takes time and patience. A full immediate respec should never be available in fo76 just because of how the game works, but if it were it ***should never*** be an atom shop item. It should be a one time thing you earn at lvl 100 or something.
---
Really? Never knew that! Thnx! :)
---
All right, man. 
---
Kiiiiiiinda feel like you're new to Fallout.
---
No. No no no no. Why? Because it sets a precedent. If people are willing to pay for a respec to make their character more powerful, then why wouldn't they be willing to pay for a nice 5 star weapon to make their character more powerful? Bethesda put their word out that no pay to win shit was going to go down. This is the worst suggestion I've seen bar none.
---
They don't fix the game they butcher the game to make money before it's over. But no one here can be surprised by that
---
I was in complete shock. Like I said? I thought I couldn't get them that way. 
---
Nice job! That is much better looking than pristine kit :-)
---
My only suggestion is if you are still in a tinkering mood, maybe a tiny bit of rust on a few of the “bare metal” spots.
---
Still, sweeeet work!
---
The scope of the games increased exponentially though.
---
A top down isometric game that runs encounters in smaller maps has a lot less variables and things to go wrong than a fully 3D game with a demand for complex AI.
---
Not that it excuses the way developers seem to ship buggy games these days, but games are more buggy now because they are vastly more complex than they where 20 years ago. 
---
People have still manage to peddle the BS that you can't role play in this game too.
---
I'm like really? If we can't role play when we're given a character with no back story beyond "you emerge from a vault" (*don't like that? We're playing fallout!!*) and decide their appearance, gender, what they are good and bad at through their stats and perks, the clothes and armour they wear, the way they fight and the weapons they use, the other kit they carry, where their home is in a world with vastly different regions, what that home is like and what that represents about them... then it's not the game. That person sucks hard at role playing.  Since when do we even have to be given a framework to use our imagination anyway? Usually players have to RP *despite* not having this stuff.
---
I currently followed the photos of the 76 ingame version. No rust on it and while I like rust on some things, I feel it'd be a little bit too extreme for something that just left the vault outside seeing as it was the day to leave om the pipboy. I do plan on adding radio, light up screen, and some blinking lights in the future!
---
Nah, they play it for the science fiction in-jokes that come from scifi socioeconomic and/or sociopolitical novels.
---
I haven't suffered a disconnection in at least 2 months. And even before they were rare. Am I really lucky or it just is a problem that affects some people a lot and some other almost never?
---
Why are you surprised by any of this?  It was pretty obvious that they were going to go down this road before the game even released.
---
I love 76 for that reason, there’s so many terminals, holotapes and environmental stories to find. I’m surprised you have found it unimmersive? 
---
I doubt “survival” mode will help much, it’s literally just a PVP mode. Your reward for surviving the longest? Everybody can see you on the map!
---
Maryland, it would look exactly like WV, but more tobacco plants.
---
And no fallout 3 doesn't count D.C isn't *technically*  Maryland.
---
I played for a while and quit when they nerfed tse. Built my whole character around it. Smh refund plz 
---
The original statement was "your arguments are invalid"
---
The second statement was "those arguments are invalid"
---
You only actually began to explain why you thought that in your second comment. Even then, not invalid (plus it comes across as dismissive)
---
Not out yet, don't know drop rates, don't know prices, "definitely not P2W" if it's unreasonably hard to earn them, it'd still be P2W, but we don't know yet because they aren't out, so claiming to know how it's going to go is just as stupid as when other people do it.
---
Not everyone has mountains of resources (take heavy weapon users, particularly of the energy or MG42 variety who'll usually be low on resources, especially after fighting the biggest bat) so the "invalid point" is just your opinion, and not actually invalid at all. Add to that the small amount of space the stash has anyway, and throwing stuff away to make room really doesn't mean a lot, plus it's an anecdote which is really poor evidence for any point (though so is mine)
---
When I'm saying slippery slope fallacy, I'm saying that people jumping right to "this will lead to legendaries in the store" etc. Are using that fallacy.
---
To claim you know they aren't going to be P2W is simply not true either, you think they aren't, they probably aren't, but we don't know yet because they aren't out. So it's alright for me to call BS on that, because you're acting like you know things you have no way of knowing.
---
I'm sure it buffs a little but it's not worth my time to actually math it. I usually just add the mods that makes it worth more caps value wise. I just look at the caps value in my menu and upgrade to the one that is worth more. 
---
Yes, this. Let the air rage in a furious cloud of hate. Let it destroy armor and any other destructible thing. Like cars camps and enemies.
---
Yep. I have the same question. I sent him a PM asking which method (for lack of a better word) he uses to experience the game. Hopefully he answers. If he does and wants help, do you want in?
---
It's just that I have other things that I could be doing with that time that's more enjoyable. 
---
Like, razor grain? Corn? Those are a cap each. A lot of mats required are at least a cap each. 
---
Easy fix is to just make the lmg use .50 in game. Problem solved, and we finally get a viable mg that has precision sights.
---
Whats tse?
---
I hated trying to remember which ammo type to use against which enemy.
---
Nah. I was just wondering if he going to the CAMP machine to do it or not. If you do it Individually it’s more. 
---
Bethesda kinda did.
---
"We also felt we could try out something new with these, both in-game and in the Atomic Shop. As we look to the future, we’re exploring ways we can bring other community-driven ideas to the game as well"
---
Not necessarily a bad thing, but it absolutely is the start of things to come.
---
Not really new as much as politics being placed in games makes me angry as I feel it doesnt belong in most games.
---
However, after reading many comments here I can accept when I am in error and see my comment being pointless here as Fallout is already full of political events and actions from those events. I wont delete my previous post as I probably deserve all the thumbs down I am and will continue to get for it. So let the Karma Fall. 
---
As an US player, I would love to see what happened to the rest of the world after it all went to shit.
---
We've seen all over America, what happened in Europe, Russia, China, what's going down in Italy?
---
How are the Swiss holding up? Are the French doing ok? I demand more geologically diverse fallouts!
---
So what you're saying is if I toss more plastic in the ocean, the mirelurks will drop more plastic?
---
I think the gutsy's are just right but should drop more loot. 
---
2 shot explosive 
---
Bugthesda doesn't make good skins... Just look at mamma murphy. 
---
I don't actually play the game, I played Beta for 20 hours (bought the key online for £1) and then bought it on a huge sale in December (£9.99), but it just didn't draw me in that much. I still keep a track of it because I've been a fan of the franchise for over 22 years.
---
They nerfed demolition perk, gunsmith perk l, and tse 
---
Same here. I have countless hours in the franchise. When it comes to FO76 I don’t mind PvP, but PvE is where it’s at for me, really.
---
It's a lot better now than it used to be. I'm sure that loot was around there. They seem to teleport meat piles now. So ya gotta be patient and look around when it does that. 
---
You have to be in game with him for more than 509 hours to claim half his junk. Just sayin.
---
Honestly, what are they thinking? There are like 5 weapons that are the most widely used. They released a minigun skin at the height of its uselessness. They released a cane skin, it's never been anything but useless. Make a gatling gun skin, a handmade rifle, a western revolver, a combat shotgun, a super sledge (one that doesn't suck) and a power fist skin. 
---
Also make a good fucking excavator paint already. Not that my blackbird paints shouldn't be usable for the damn excavator (still wondering wtf on that deal) but since they aren't, give me a goddamn alternative already. The blue and red toy soldier looking paint doesn't work for me.
---
Got a spare T60 shock on PC for free 
---
I'm sure the servers are designed to spread people out among worlds before they fill worlds to capacity
---
You'll get some good repair kits soon lol...
---
Too soon? Jk
---
At 50%
---
Hey sorry. Honestly been playing Division 2 a lot lately, returning to Fallout about every other night. But if you see me online I’d definitely be down to join you. Add me on PSN: Hermes3339
---
It doesnt bother me much personally. But it does conflict with "only cosmetics".
---
And they should have known this is a bad bad bad idea PR wise. This is just giving ammo to those that want to fire shots at Bethesda and Fallout 76.
---
You want Tank Killer in Per for the armour penetration. Just swap out the picklocks for that. Do you use pistols a lot? Six points for +40% damage is a lot when you could get rank 1 basic/expert/master cardsa nd have +30% for three points spent. You could then use those Agi points for some Adrenaline and Gun Fu. If you're using crits a lot you might want to fill out Crit Savvy too.  
---
I don’t think you can unless it’s part of the workshop. I tried moving my camp into the tunnel beneath the road in the red mire, but decided to move when I realized that I couldn’t lock the doors. 
---
They’re to busy putting in repair kits to the atom shop then to deal with major bugs
---
looks like a ps2 game
---
Never claimed to know they aren’t going P2W just said this isn’t an example of that and that the community is woke on those tactics and won’t allow it to happen. All the arguments are invalid tho when it comes to framing them in Pay to Win terms, you can be offended by this but it wasn’t my intention only speaking the truth. 
---
You’re guilty of the same things you’re accusing me of, assuming disparities between players based on the availability of these items. Take a page from your own book bruh and don’t get so triggered over being confronted about a statement that someone disagrees with.
---
Yes, yes they do
---
... and we should NOT be able to sit or sleep with mobs around, or at least be able to cancel the animation.
---
Gimme that real MD experience, the boring one most of the year round until summer hits and every fucking idiot from jersey to Florida come to the god awful tiki bar.
---
The handmade would use 7.62x39, totally different than the 7.62x51. 
---
For regular guns, yes, but I still really miss it for 40mm. 
---
I once got a TSE pump shotgun for 250 caps. Still have it just don't use it anymore. 
---
Dang, could have had some interesting stuff going if so.
---
I rarley use the pistols, it's just a backup in case my rifle breaks so I might take those cards out completley! Thanks for the feedback mate! 
---
Difference is you can’t exchange real money for Caps. 
---
This is getting tiring; are you honestly happy with a game you’ve paid for leveraging additional payable items that can change the core game experience? Atoms can be earned from doing jobs in game but wouldn’t you prefer to complete a challenge and it gives you a repair kit pack, or plans to make them and that is how additional content is delivered?
---
I'll take 2
---
Not a problem. I am happy that you took the time to actually 'advertise' it.
---
Sometimes timing is just not ideal, no harm no foul :)
---
happened to me last week and i tried to tag her with a shotgun but didn't get any loot from the queen, sad day for a melee bro
---
Spent two full days building near whitesprings, and all was well.
---
Then I placed a trashcan a bit too close to the resort and next time I server hopped I couldn't place my camp. Ah well, at least I enjoy building. 
---
I played fallout 1 for the first time 21 years ago. 
---
Adding to that, if you want a decent set of mutations, you'll need room in Luck for Starched Genes and Class Freak. 
---
Tank killer, long shot, better critical are a must in my opinion and definitely get the eagle eyes mutation. You’ll need starched genes as well to make sure you don’t lose it.
---
You can use the lock pick points for some of those.
---
I would also get adamantium perk instead of dromedary. Completely Eliminates your limbs damage to zero, which will help you last long in battle 
---
I think she's way better than she used to be. Haven't seen one fail in a couple weeks. She's like clockwork
---
I have the blueprint for those... x-01 ONLY drops in mods, and are rare as hens teeth.
---
I think it's a bit late to fix the environment in the fallout universe.. 
---
exactly
---
Um... I walk away with 1500+ with Super Duper...
---
\- It is perfectly viable to gather more resources than one will ever need without ever touching a workshop.
---
\- Workshops are an open invitiation to PvP \*anywhere on the map and without warning.\*
---
\- I drink my acid like any civilised person does :P
---
If your on PC add me and I'll let you know if I come across some, I do all vendors at least once a day, and I got mine already! 
---
And let’s be honest, environmental issues are not even a political issue, it’s a real thing that is happening right now independently from what the left or the right is telling us.  
---
I'm not that worried about it, it's just one of those things that's indicative of my experience with this game. 
---
I’m not even joking we skated her 7 times tonight on multiple servers. 
---
Down down down she goes, but the drops we’ll absolutely terrible, it was embarrassing.
---
1-2 star drops from the endgame boss.
---
And most of it was troubleshooter, hunter, nocturnal armour.
---
Not one legendary weapon dropped for me it was atrocious 
---
I have a 4* bloody machete 
---
They are out there still but the drops and chances of finding are slim to none. Random lucky (very lucky) drops 
---
&gt;And now people are furiously claiming that this is the beginning of pay to win... are you kidding me? It’s a repair kit not an op gun. Not to mention that the vast majority who play 76 don’t even bother with pvp. Even then, having a repair kit really isn’t going to give anyone an edge. I know this is an unpopular opinion here and I’m sure I’ll get a lot of downvotes &amp; hate, but seriously, it’s just a fuckin’ repair kit people.
---
I've played and defended the game since the beta, but the apologetics here is ridiculous. Like, literally the Atom Shop's page says that nothing in the shop gives you an advantage. Repair kits in it makes that a lie. It's not about PVP, it's about the fact that the game was literally sold to us with the written assurance from the developers that all MTX in the game would be cosmetic. I know someone in the thread is making fun of this by infantilizing people complaining, but seriously, a company blatantly going back on previous promises isn't okay. It's odd that people think that it is. 
---
Plus, they literally asked for feedback. The fact that almost every topic since the article was posted is about them is the clearest reflection of how the community feels about anything to do with the game so far. Nothing yet has gotten this level of outcry. It's fine you don't care about it. You're just obviously in the minority. 
---
Never saw anything of it. Where do I need to write to so that I can have mine? I filled the form out and got a info that it would be sent.   
---
How was this supposed to go down?  
---
What you got?
---
LOL !
---
Imma bloodied sneaker. I'd say my build.is umorthodox and I'm decently hard to kill
---
If I change my icon, it's always permanent. No idea why it changes for you, when relogging. 
---
Take a look at my page
---
Bold
---
Its great idea consedering their lots of specs are common
---
Well I cant day I think its okay hits are not registered. Its not.
---
Is the game still worth downloading again for the exploration factor?
---
Me too!
---
Happened to me too. But there was like ten level 40 and under running around doing nothing but dying over and over. 
---
iirc the only fourth legendary effect a weapon can have is either a Scorched killers receiver or 
---
a poisoning effect on a machete , I might be wrong since that’s all I’ve seen.
---
Tin foil hat and welding goggles. 
---
I thought most weightless armour did that to chameleon.... I may have misread some of my weightless armour though.
---
Also, thanks for not being condescending or a dick about it 👍
---
Easy way to power up the Gauss Rifle is give it a receiver upgrade called Auxiliary Harness that changes it to a heavy weapon classification and allows it to auto-charge the round/skip the charging and fire from full on every shot.
---
Pretty much this. I want to explore and finish quests, not get into a four hour gun fight. 
---
Mine hasn't change since I got that Christmas one, might need to lodge a ticket with Bethesda.
---
I thought it was available in the atom shop , called something like military uniform ?
---
Id give you silver if I could for this
---
Tactics had pvp multiplayer. 
---
I have been playing since 1 released
---
The meat piles sometimes teleport back to the initial spawn point of the mob if it's an area with a lot of enemies, like Whitespring. Next time search the usual places the ghouls spawn at. 
---
If you think raising awareness for environmental issues is bad, I have news for you buddy. You're a fucking nonce. 
---
I know this is kind of old but I still experience this issue too. It’s kind of like wasting your level up. Also have issues with cards from packs disappearing or not being added at all. Haven’t even gotten a pack since after level 10. Currently at 16 now. 
---
In hindsight I should have not posted that at 2am
---
Nope, not saying that. But I now understand where you and some others are coming from. 
---
Yeah, essentially. It's not really a big deal. Mostly a convenience thing I guess if you're seriously dungeon crawling and you refused to repair your items to 200%, to which I say "you only have yourself to blame" 
---
So much this
---
Nah, that's it. Scorched Killer receiver for guns/rifles and Serrated Blade mod (I think that's the name) for the Machete. The SKR is pretty shit, to be honest. A hardened receiver does more damage...
---
If no one gets back to you. I sell X01 shocks for 1k per leg. I won't be online till tomorrow though 
---
When they are repaired over 100% dr increase. Numbers I mentioned are for 100% repaired items. So yes, it may skyrocket to those numbers 
---
The vendors don’t offer the mods anymore. But the plans still drop—but uncommonly. 
---
stay mad in your own threads fam
---
reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a9d5vd/this_is_a_bullsht_rant/
---
dont be upset no more 
---
Alrighty, I can do that too. Let me know when you are back online.
---
Face it, that was WAY too expensive for a single shot for a weapon that can barely do any damage.
---
Getting it naturally is easier, it should be the first mutation you get.
---
Too soon.
---
&gt; I see the repair kit as a viable option to the person that works 70 hours a week and doesn’t want to spend the few hours they have every week to grind for repair junk.
---
This is already a horrendously absurd comment. Anyone who works 70 hours a week is not a games audience, especially not this one. It is not an audience that any online game should cater to. You may as well be the guy who shows up at a minigolf course at 2 AM and wonder why it's not open, and demand that the owner keep it open 24 hours because it's so difficult for him to find time during the week because of his 70 hour work load. I can't trust anyone's opinion on a game if they've played for over 3 months... for a collective 24 hours. I'm not saying I don't have sympathy for someone who works that many hours a week... but it's like saying we should cater to the guy who finally showed up to a party after 5 months of inviting him over, and then he never shows up again.
---
The whole point behind pay to win mechanics is that the people who take advantage of it aren't necessarily the people who purchases things for the convenience, but pay to have another advantage on top of grinding for stuff just like anyone else, which creates a large disparity between those who buy and those who don't, like a streamer who gets 100s of dollars of expendable income a day and plays a game for several hours a day could get a massive advantage over other players.
---
Is this repair kit an example of extreme pay to win? No. But does it have the potential to be the precursor to other pay to win items and mechanics? Yes. And I don't care how big or small the advantage may be. 
---
The fact that Bethesda hasn't attempted to potentially clarify what this repair kit is, is also more or less confirming our fear that they're implementing a pay to win mechanic anyway, even though people have clearly stated before that we haven't had pay to win mechanics and would greatly like to keep it that way. Hell, the guy who stated originally that Fallout 76 would keep it cosmetic only mentioned that he'd definitely like to avoid anything like the whole Battlefront 2 shitstorm.
---
every time i login to the game my icon reverts to default. i bought one from the atomic shop but i have to re equip each time. i am on on PS4
---
But r6 is P2W, you can buy operatives with real money and get advantage over people with real money so its p2w. Basically  csgo, dota2,fortnite only not p2w games from top of my head.
---
But people tend to relate differently to games that they are like. POE have heavy p2w related stuff with its  stashes and you cant get them grinding. R6,LoL,HoTs and similar games have p2w via grinding "champions" but nobody care because people like this games and  publishers. 
---
But if people dont like publishers or games they will bash it for stuff  more lovely games get pass.
---
I'm in no way trying to say anything with this, I really am just curious... Why do you still play 76? Just something to do that is Fallout? You like the lore? You like the game? I'm not a fan myself, dosn't mean I think other peoples opinions are trash, it just does not hold my interest. It's not free enough like it's SP versions can be, obviously. 
---
Okay, so, first, the scenario you just described is a scenario where it might matter. Second, I'm in no way suggesting that it will be a common occurrence, but that it could happen is the crux of the matter. Should anybody quit playing over Repair Kits? Probably not. Is this going to change the Meta? No. But, "convenience items" are not the Cosmetic Only that was originally advertised and a door that could open up to more offensive monetization practices. Also, have you ever had your chameleon armor break in a situation you would really like to have some stealth in? Or have a primary weapon break only to find out you forgot to make ammo for your secondary? If these weren't useful, nobody would want them or buy them. And some people will 100% buy these when they make them available.
---
I'd like to buy a set as well. I'll be on tomorrow. Afternoon.
---
i love using my cryolator on her. when i begin to freeze her i always say "Its an ICE day outside" or "Ice to meet all of you". next thing every other player sees is her slowing down a LOT
---
Of the new ones I'm honestly the kind that loves Fallout 3 the most (likely as that was my first game in the Fallout world), Fallout 1 would be amazing but GOD DAMN that timer that gives you no chance to fuck around. Fallout 2 = fucking best of all of them IMO. 
---
And you waited two weeks to say something?  Just curious why?  
---
Aww sweet
---
GT - the Welsh Gaz 
---
Message me when I'm on
---
Yeah I personally think Fallout 3 was way better than NV for the game its self. but NV had better game-play AKA mechanics like being able to actually aim (LOL) and cooler perks. But Fallout 2 is still the best one, the dark humour combine with a real RPG feel because, well it was a real RPG. Sure 3 and NV were RPG's but didn't feel quite the same. Then there's Fallout 4.... fucking amazing game but a really bad Fallout game / RPG. 
---
"15 guys". That there is the problem. The more people, the higher LVL defence/health she has. The queen is meant to be end game content and difficult, so if you're joined by a bunch of people, some lower levels, others there not helping (just trying to get a free ride) or not packing weapons/perks with enough dmg output, then you'll fail. Kind of annoying for people who put in the time to run silo, for it to then become an open community event that can be ruined by people getting involved who really shouldn't.
---

Nice one has it got bleed damage and poison?
---
Should be online about 2pm GMT
---
You know, I would add the nature of the game has changed too. Now there’s survival mode, true PvP, and the nature of the Atom Shop will probably change because of it. Fallout 76 is no longer the game it was when it launched. The story and game as it is pushes playing with friends and teaming up, working together, etc. The Atom Shop reflected the original game, not the new survival mode.
---
My two cents, anyway. The collective freak out about this whole issue has been all over the place and I just wanted to put out there that I’d like a repair kit in the game, pls. 
---
It’s not as though Fallout has a lot of inherently political themes or anything. Totally.
---
Cause i just got reddit 24 hours ago, after my friend requested that i'd post it on reddit :)
---
Proof that i had it since the event can be found on riflegaming's channel
---
I got the BOS chest  plan last night from scrapping a random piece of armor I found with a treasure map. 
---
yeah thats what i mean. It would be a model skin for the combat armor
---
Well good news. Atoms can't be bought in Japan. We all have to grind we want some of the cosmetics.
---
That's the whole point of fallout
---
It has 40 percent less damage while power attacking, targets bleed and are poisoned, exceptional damage, +30 percent damage to scorched, and +50 percent limb damage
---
There was one, someone killed him.
---
R.I.P Traveling Merchant.
---
Rip.
---
I offer 1cap for it.
---
I should play some more Red Dead Redemption 2...
---
Look at all the fanboys downvoting lol.
---
I mean I am a fallout fan but they fucked us over. 
---
RIP is right.  Either massive downvote or griefing to come.  🤷🏼‍♀️
---
I’d take this down while there’s still time.  😬
---
Two shot explosive guns, they were extremely overpowered and fortunately they were nerfed, but the guy above you obviously enjoyed one shotting lvl 91 glowing deathclaws
---
Best post ever.  I approve.
---
And those are the same people that wouldn’t pick up on it if it wasn’t pointed out to them or just super obvious 
---
And it kind of is a big deal in Survival, to be honest, because this equals instantaneous field repairs of gear without having to risk travel to a workbench. That's a pretty significant advantage.
---
I uninstalled all my mods and did a fresh install and I still have the issue. 
---
As the game is now I am reluctant to spend any mony on it.  
---
The game has to change a bit further for me to consider this.
---
Then maybe I'll spend some money on cosmetics for my camp.
---
Wow, we'are a bunch of old fuckers here, aren't we?
---
NCR Ranger Veteran armour. That is all.
---
I’ll offer 100 caps. 
---
I'd also appreciate less of these mass sales/ content removal. For me, it's basically an excuse to not need to login for a week. I'm sitting at 5000 atoms and have little incentive to grind for more when the items that I want to purchase are so few and far between.  I regularly recuperate what I've spent in time for the next content that interests me...
---
If I'm not mistaken, we still have data-mined content from last year revealing items that still aren't available on the shop? I might be wrong on that one, but I'm still waiting on a Nuka-World face paint. I sure hope it wasn't a limited time sale that I missed!
---
They are doing double xp for adventure at the end of the month. 
---
And how is it that cooked food spoils so fast as well? I gave up cooking meat when I took on the carnivore mutation and just eat it all raw now.
---
We need fishing net in the game now, too.
---
Probably because the game is a lazy asset flip and has harly any radio music or content
---
Should have left this dumpster fire to burn out fuck man 
---
It is blatantly obvious why and what these consumables are about: MONEY. you spend 20 and don't need to worry about repairing items. It is pay to win in a small way to open the door for future small pay to win items. 
---
Thanks for sharing, this worked for me as well oddly enough
---
That'll be a future addition to the Atom Store at some point...
---
The nerf was back in January. Repair were just announced this week. Are you that ridiculously paranoid?
---
It's the gnomes I tell you!
---
It would also help if armors showed which variant they were (light/study/heavy). Having to look it up with legendaries is a pain.
---
Surgical mask and field helmet. Thank me later.
---
So what exactly is the difference between pieces you pick up randomly and 'maximum' durability pieces? Is the DR different if both are max repaired?
---
*In a nasaly voice*Hello nifty America it's me John henry....HAHAAAAA GOTCHA THREE DAWG HERE..... 
---
Good for you, but what’s the point of your post ? All I cared about was getting it during the Fasnacht Parade. I personally don’t care if anyone else has it, it doesn’t matter. Plus since these masks are so rare, you should definitely not attract so much attention, just an advice.
---
I started with FO3....
---
Don't know if that means I'm long time or not, but I'm definitely a fan.
---
Have another downvote
---
You don't have the Mister Sandman perk which is a lot of free damage at night for just two points.
---
3 points in lead belly is a waste. All you need is a single point in Sun Kissed.
---
Great idea actually. Makes a lot of sense - just thinking of the lead in paint and lead in kid's toys in the universe already. ;)
---
But bethesda alr gave a roadmap and i had fun with the game. 
---
Nope. Wrong. Nice try though.
---
I love buying cosmetics, have spent $30 AUD so far on atoms, and I am thoroughly against anything other than cosmetics in the atom shop
---
That’s just asking for someone to scream the n word at everyone on the server
---
Because it thinks it’s holding something else up. 
---
Maybe you could post a picture and then we could help
---
Where abouts was this?
---
They know what they are doing, they need game aspects and add a solution in the atom store.
---
Wouldn't be surprised if they released something in the store to make Two Shot weapons do the damage they used to if they thought they could sell it 
---
I know what it’s like I had all my wood steel and aluminum on me to trade with someone and they killed me and took it all
---
Keep that thing in your bank, give it 6 months it will be the equivalent of the Halloween mask of runescape for fallout 76's in game economy
---
I am much like you (hence the username lol) when it was first out I played and I hated it buggy as shit and I was bored quickly so I stopped playing while they dealt with the issues. I've been playing again a few weeks now and I have to say I'm finally enjoying myself I dont like playing with others so I'm plodding along by myself and it plays much better now no crashes so far and some seriously good bad guys to kill (all dead or monsters of course) and now storage is a half decent amount you can make a good camp. 
---
Just read posts on this subreddit, watch some gameplays on YouTube...
---
And finally, try it. Then you’ll know !
---
This is probably best left for that Facebook group as this sub has a rule against witch hunting.
---
For that type of content you would need to pay bethesda. Are you will to pay?
---
Gimme ma goddam raider haircuts from the older games and the cages / other raider camp stuff from Fallout 4.
---
I get we're not supposed to be raiders but I went a bit feral out there.
---
Raider themed paints for all armour / power armour. Let me weld rebar to everything! 
---
😢 Oh man, that sucks as much as my story.
---
The last thing anyone needs in a game is stressing about losing progress or stuff because of bugs. An entire evening of trying to relax and farm stuff, all lost because of broken mechanics or common crashes / bugs. And a patch once a month that not only doesn't address most bugs (this game has thousands!) but adds new ones that create more frustration.
---
I think it's time to take a break from this game. I could have had fun in another game and wouldn't finish the gaming evening frustrated (after a hard and long week at work). It's just not worth it. 
---
Thanks, think I might give it a go
---
Sucks. This may be an unpopular opinion but isn’t that all on you for taking that risk? Mules are not intended or supported.
---
If you foresee that this is something that you are going to engage on often - storing goods, caps, mats etc on 'alt' toons - purchase an additional game license.
---
It is not 100% foolproof, you can still lose 'stuff' to server instability/crashes but it is more efficient, reliable and convenient than relying on third parties.
---
Given how inexpensive licenses are - as in a 'fresh' game key that you activate, not a pre-owned account; I would not touch any of those with a barge pole - and the utility they bring to the game is money well spent.
---

---
That's strange. I bought a new few weeks ago, equipped it and it's still equipped. No problems.
---
You were blackout drunk.  How do you know it wasn't you?
---
I seriously think they’re under a “make money or else” type of ultimatum, and repair kits and other convenience items are a much lower-hanging fruit than a vast catalogue of cosmetics that won’t not only take time, but also money they likely don’t have allocated. 
---
If the launch had been more successful, the situation might be different now. 
---
But it’s a 1 time fee dummy . How long do you expect them to be able to pay the devs salary for this game with the shitty release numbers ? Do you want them to shut the servers down within a year? They aren’t a charity or non-profit 
---
I believe the recipes are random rewards.
---
Max DR is the same no matter whether it’s picked up, created with 1 intelligence or 30 intelligence. But every 5 points of intelligence until 20 increases max durability, which makes the armor to sustain increased DR for more. 
---
Let’s say two of the same items one with lower durability and another with higher durability (longer bar) received 1 cm of durability loss, if let’s say the max dr is 100 and if that 1 cm is 20 points of dr lost for higher one, it would be 40 for the lower durability one. So it’s somewhat significant
---
Wow you’re not bright
---
Why they don’t bother responding^
---
Thinking about getting rid of goat legs and slapping those mods on my already 3* legs. Wanna if their comparable 
---
Their name has already been tarnished forever for even releasing this cesspool of a game though....
---
You come from a Vault okay ? You’re not supposed to go cra-cra.
---
I haven't played Fallout 76 myself but on the Betheseda games I have played  I've also gotten a fair amount of annoyance and frustration because of game-breaking bugs which they didn't bother to fix and I had to download a community patch to fix. For example the bug where in Fallout 3 where leaving the first starting vault the game CTD'ed without the fairly large community patch which fixed it,and other similar bugs. Having to put up with such things strikes me as unacceptable by any standards.
---
And yet allowed crossover characters making it pointless lol. Every single thing this company does, tries, or adds is laced with failure 
---
Fuck man. I had finally gotten over my need to open over safe I see. I hate how tedious it is to switch the perk cards. But you remind me what I could be missing. 
---
Sorry this happened, but why would you just give a stranger 20.000 bottle caps? 
---
I know you wanted to mule but that amount of money is something you move with trusted friends or someone you’ve played with, not a random stranger.
---
As a side note get in touch with the group admins or make a group post warning others about this person, post their name and your story.
---
I wish you all the best 
---
Fox News says that plastic feeds the animals and fights socialism. So let's dump microbeads and straws into every stream, river and ocean.
---
'Merica!!!!!
---
I get it all the time too. Usually after playing for a bit or putting the console to sleep, then back next day and playing again next day for a short while. I also get it often when fast travelling to Big Al's for Biv's daily quest.
---
I stopped relying on console sleep to save a few seconds on game load in the beginning. I still can play a few hours maximum before it crashes. And it's always CE-34787.
---
So annoying! 
---
Yup Solomon’s pond is right there. Down the hill from there if you fast travel. Guaranteed spawn pretty much unless someone already killed it. I go there daily 
---
The raiders came from wealthy families that were hanging out in ski resorts. everyone can go cra-cra
---
Recepies are random rewards.  
---
Thou you can get the hard lemonade recepie from the elusive lemonade trade bot that spawns in random spawn points so you will just have to get lucky with that one.  
---
You can even get the Nuka Dark recepie from BIV, a friend got it while I was watching him play.  
---
Let’s also get the camouflaged variant as an under armor.
---
I hate the raiders. They're scum that pray on society after the world ends. I also like technology and all the visually clean stuff. In Fallout 4 I liked the institute most and the brotherhood.
---
We're complete opposites 😂😂😂
---
Love the look, I got a buddy who doesn't like to wear the outfits because it covers up all that janky hodgepodge of metal he calls armor and is loving every second of it.
---
I myself have an entire wardrobe ^stashbox full of outfits and am looking for more.
---
But I would **love** junk walls and stuff from Fo4 to make my camp seem less *professionally* put together and more, cobbled together from drift wood and string. 
---
Yes. Yes it is. 
---
You'd also be surprised how many people jump into survival not knowing this or not caring. I've seen people drop enormous amounts of stuff on death.  
---
Also, OP, if you get killed at a spawn and respawn there, that's on you. You walk into a fissure and find out it kills you, you stop doing it. This is no different. 
---
Yeah but you’re supposed to be America’s best and brightest !
---
Then come Monday , "hey guys, we hear you, we're taking all the feedback we receive into consideration. We're currently re-working our plans for making you pay to repair weapons and store any food item for more than 8 seconds before paying into Todd's golden toilet seat fund". 
---
Sadly this sub has a rule about witch hunting, although in cases like this I'm all for it for scum like this.
---
That kid is his accomplice in "the great 2019 fo76 20k caps scam"? Sad that you did not crop the kid out. I think 20k caps is not that much. Bethesda should increase fo76 cap limit. I don't think they realize players want to be cap billionaires.
---
I concur.
---
Once you find the spot.. If it doesn't pan out, server hop and try again. Took me 50+ tries. Especially if someone sets up camp there. That throws off the random spawn.
---
They buffed energy weapons, but they still can break pretty quick and deal less damage compared to regular guns. Learning mods is also a horrible grind. 
---
Dailies are lost on crashes until next day. Only exception is Biv's quest, which is caked a "repeatable". 
---
Game is full of bugs and crashes all the time. It sucks big time and is very annoying. 
---
Aluminum and lead. Nothing else. 
---
Awe that's a bummer! Thanks though. 
---
I got the aluminum bat.  
---
Never thought yellow would be unobtainable.
---
The brightest of putting needles into people and myself!
---
My guess is you didn't. When you bulk, the bulked items are placed in your inventory regardless of where the mats came from. 
---
Now that’s really cra-cra
---
I started then stopped NV twice before it finally hooked me. Now it's my favorite of them all. I think at about the point I got ED-E and pissed off the Legion things got real. 
---
The DLCs are also terrific. I still need to get Sierra Madre. 
---
Cant blame you for that. At least you can have your lovely clean lab coat. 
---
You'll sometimes loose then forever... Coming back next day to start a particular daily won't trigger it. They will never trigger for your character. Sometimes some of them recover after a patch.

ALWAYS get a friend. Someone you know outside the internet.

Safest route.

What ever lie you require to live.

I'm in Australia, apparently up to date, but don't have this "repair kit" in AS. Is it an update coming, or is it there now on other servers. I won't be buying, but there is loads of talk about it, just wondering really
---
Yes exactly. Irc there were also wall that you couldnt build by yourself but were party of trapper and other raider settlements. I liked those too!
---
Go to the Vault-Tec Ag building in Flatwoods then follow the river north. Tons of glowing fungi there, along with all the mats needed to make disease cures and healing salves.  The firecaps for the disease cures are around Slocum's Joe.  Make sure to have "Green Thumb" on. 
---
I like having to swap out. If perks were passive then they are no longer perks (ie: everyone has all utility automatically at lvl 50)
---
Depends who the enemy is.  If you're doing PvP there's a pretty good chance it is a water pistol (fireproof + dense chest).
---
Thanks for injecting some sanity into the discussion. Still shaking my head when trivial utility items are being called PtW. 
---
Remember guys, they could have used a stolen name and picture. Don't witchhunt
---
Why run a poll when they have actual solid data on what players *do* spend atoms on?
---
^This I need to know too.  What a mystery this is
---
Yeah a lot of the stuff from the raiders looked *bad* but **good** in an aesthetically pleasing way.
---
And it would definitely be cool if there was more of a cosmetic variety to in-game raider armor and power armor pieces.
---
If they lowed the prices they would sale more
---
If they made armor and weapon paints usable on any armor weapon they would sale more
---
If they had lots of different templates and colors for to design your own pipboy/armor/weapons skins they would sale more
---
If the sold wallpaper for your camp they would sale more
---
I could keep going 
---
But then again what do I know??? 
---
That's fair enough. So make a different slot where you can change all utility perks at the same time instead of having to do it one at a time. It's incredibly tedious and not to mention annoying when you forget to change them all back. And like I said, you would still have to level up to assign points into the separate build slot.
---
Agree completely. Every looting online rpg game has had this feature from the get go. No idea why this wasn't there from the beginning
---
I’ve been using the Miners Guantlet for the last 10 levels thinking it was a one-handed.  Smh
---
No, Why?
---
Yo crop that kid out man just seems weird af. Ain’t nobody gonna be seeing this dudes face so the photo is meaningless. Sucks to get scammed that’s why you gotta go with people with lots of karma or friends, someone with something to lose.
---
Hopefully I can catch y'all sometime this weekend!
---
It be cool if they offered "Raidered" versions of other armor, like cracked combat armor with extra pieces bolted to it or marine armor that has extra bits soldered on and some bits taken off.
---
Maybe the raider versions changed the stats a little like for example, less energy defense on the combat armor ver. Or maybe way less durability for more base stats because it's cobbled together from what can be looted from the dead or broken pieces found thrown away.
---
Updooted to try and help you out of the negative.
---
I agree that people seem a bit hyperbolic, and that youtube coverage has been pretty harsh on it just to get page-views. Whats been announced isn't actual pay to win... yet. You don't neeeed repair kits. With the perks most people run with, they're pretty redundant.
---
But I think the idea here is that we're on a slippery slope to true pay to win. First the unstoppable's thing, now this, next fridges so any aid item you craft or pick up doesn't go bad in 12 seconds. Anything beyond that is total conjecture... but suffice it to say, it definitely feels like waters are being tested here. The louder the "NOPE" we yell, the less likely Bethesda is to dive in. They're testing community patience, intelligence, and attentiveness. 
---
Guess you guys have your answer... time to tell the community you're sorry!
---
Does the value of the drop depend on the number of techdatas you collect and submit? 
---
I could have easily used his other picture without the kid. I left it on purpose, hoping the scammer sees it and knows, not only him but also his family members will be shamed for his act. I wrote him on facebook and informed that all of that will stop when he gives back what he stole.
---
I don't do survival but, maybe it's to die on their own terms?
---
I'd much rather kill myself than let someone kill me.
---
I met one of them yesterday. He said he is a friend and some sort of Scientist. He told me that he wanted rebuild Appalachia and make us all a brighter future. I invited him into my rusty and broken Shack. The one thing he didn't knew about this region was that it was the territory of the Gourmets :X I'm wearing his shoes  now. I liked em :)
---
Fatman
---
We se us in the Wasteland, Metalsuit &gt;8c
---
Imma go buy some straws real quick..
---
Although I agree it's a shitty move. I feel your anger should be directed towards Devs that implement stupid systems such as that. If you leave the server, you should loose your position.
---
Sadly?
---
yes, he is the game DIRECTOR ! 
---
only in the US is environmental issues a political issue
---
I was gonna say to define "long term" since the super long termers from the original fallouts wouldnt class people like us (FO3 and onwards) as long term, but I have played since FO3, which is probably my most ever played game:  
---
I fist played it and completed it several times on my brothers old PC, then I got it for my old old PC and completed it a load of times, then I got it for PS3 and completed it a load of times, then I got it on steam and "hardly touched it" and have 200 hours there.  
---
I pre ordered NV andgot a snazzy t-shirt I still wear to this day, and I spent fuck tons of time on too but almost entirely on PS3, Fallout 4 I pre ordered as soon as I could on steam, took a week off work to play it and have 1311 hours on it on steam (which despite being my "favorite" is also my least played, now I pre ordered FO76 Power Armour Edition and have 400+ hours in it currently.  
---
Good times
---
Wind chimes are a constant temptation. 
---
Fatman. Just found my first 
---
Pretty fun isn’t it ?
---
“To those that haven’t been lucky enough to get the mask” 
---
So basically every other player who participated in that event lol. I’m happy for you man, if I found it I’d end up selling it cause I only play first person but it’s still a unique item. Did you happen to record yourself receiving it as a reward from the event? Jw
---
"Oh yeaaaah Bethesda you are so great the naysayers can "s" a "d" because you are here for us and you make gaming great again"
---
Here we go again. Told you so: they do something remotely good, they fuck it up in 2 weeks tops with something outrageously idiot move.
---
And the worst thing is, you idiots just stuck with this garbage and pumping more money into it, only to whine on reddit from time to time. Hilarious.
---
it's already done they promise there will be no non cosmetic item in the atom shop but they already break it and the game is not even 1 years ago 
---
 "We hope this is a fair balance between allowing people to express their disdain for this move &gt;&gt;&gt;FOR A REASONABLE TIME&lt;&lt;&lt;"  no wonder this subreddit is such garbage.  
---
oh you are allowed to express yourself (OFFER AVAILABLE FOR A LIMITED TIME ONLY)
---
Take everything slowly and explore thoroughly, don't power level to lvl 50 and you should be able to enjoy the game reasonably well.
---
I won't say the game is without its problems but there is still a lot of fun to be had.
---
Honest answer is I don't know for sure, but not in my experience, additional data only increases the amount of XP and Caps (which caps out at 4 Techdata), the loot drop % remains the same no matter how much you put in. 
---
 Full disclosure, I only tried multiple techdata 10 times, so I may have been unlucky. 
---
 I'm crunching the numbers now on my Techdata quest and will post something more substantial shortly.
---
Thats exactly why everyone is doing that. 
---
For some reason I can't see the imgur link, so I can't tell which one OP was talking about, but there was one available. The nuke code officers wear several different uniforms - one of them was on the Atom Shop, the "Military Officer Uniform". Another had been datamined quite some time ago, it's allegedly called the "Military Intel Officer" uniform. So that's another of the nuke code officers' uniforms we'll be able to get. No word on whether we can get the camouflaged fatigues some of them wear, but I would not at all be surprised.
---
I can craft you the escalator shocks if you want that done.
---
I have the fear they meant unlocking to find them troughout the game. Just like the rare ones they intend to give as a reward somewhere.
---
we are far past the slippery slope. what the fuck more do you need? this is ridiculous.
---
Hey makes sense to me, especially if it's something the game allows.
---
It's like life really, you either live long enough to get killed or kill yourself 
---
As long you are a big fat target on the Map for Caps Vultures, this is the right instinctive thing todo. Noone would like it to get hunted from potentially 23 Other People for no reason than just surviving the longest as it should be in a survival world and not a Deathmatch Game.
---
That's pretty ass.
---
Usually it's a good idea not to move all your money at once. Best splitting the 20k across like 5 different sessions trading 4k or something.
---
  Cool thanks. I stopped doing it after the 30th time of getting some useless ammo and 20 or so caps.
---
Cool well I reported this post for the photo, I think it’s creepy and wrong to exploit a child like that even for the reason you state. The photo contributes nothing, you’ve got his IGN so I recommend deleting it.
---
There's too much difference between the gun gutsy and the laser gutsy. The laser one does piddly damage, barely even a concern - this is a problem with most energy weapons in the game. The gun Gutsy, however, will shred through any and all armor like it's not even there.
---
"Consumers like you are what kill the chance to enjoy games and what kill the entire market"
---
I haven't laughed that hard in months.
---
You pay 60 bucks for a half-assed, taped together shit excuse of a game and seriously defend this practice. Consumers like YOU are the reason why we have this garbage like early access and "Games as a Service". YOU are what ruins the market for every other player that wants value for their money. YOU are the reason why EA, Ubisoft and Bethesda release their games pretty much in early alpha status and you ACTUALLY seem to like it, how fucking far do your standards have to drop? Not even in the Anthem Subreddit, they were this oblivious to the shady practices that went on.
---
Just face it. FO76 is a bad game devoid of content. Even with the latest DLC there's no content. Building a base is more fun now, that's it. 90% of the indie games on steam do offer more than this shit, the only reason it sells is because it has the Fallout name slapped on it.
---
&gt; new crafted world
---
Oh wow, that's probably the LEAST i can expect
---
&gt; new assists
---
I think you mean "assets". Shocker - there are barely any new assets. 
---
&gt; entire multiplayer framework
---
They literally advertised this as "multiplayer game" so a "multiplayer farmework" is not a feature, it's a goddamn necessity.
---
&gt; photo mode
---
Yes, this literally saves the game. Lawl.
---
&gt; challenge and perk system
---
We had challenges before, called "achievements". And the perk card system is terrible and was designed for more monetization (perk card packs were supposed to be sold for atoms).
---
&gt; new VATS 
---
Funfact, in FO3, there was a command in the console that removes the pausing from the VATS. That's literally the same as the VATS in FO76. 
---
&gt; pipboy changes 
---
What kind of Pipboy changes? The pipboy is still as shit as it was before with a terrible handling. And it's even worse because it can't pause the game in multiplayer anymore.
---
Consumers like us aren't the ones who kill the market. It's consumers like you who gladly take every shit a developer throws at them and thank them like a submissive bitch. YOU are the ones who show developers they can get away with anything, therefore we will never see a polished game. YOU ruined bethesda because YOU didn't stand up and showed them they can't release shit like that. Congratulations on your achievement.
---
I unfortunately already run into Player DJs on Area Mic blasting their 'sick tunes'. 
---
:(
---
Would be a pretty neat mechanic though.
---
minigun
---
Jesus that's sad, you made the stupid decision to ask a stranger to hold your caps for you, it backfired, and now your trying to cause a witch hunt and ruin this guy's life because of your own stupidity. 
---
Mods can we please ban this guy, this is targeted harassment and he shouldn't be allowed to partake in this sub
---
I've already managed to get excavator shocks done. But thanks anyway. Just trying to get some X01 shocks now.
---
Ironically, even though tons of companies banned straws and shit they contribute like 0.01% of the ocean plastic.
---
I have decided that planting plots/pots inside your camp, while protected, are no-more-so than a properly secured garden. This is a predominantly (if not entirely?) cosmetic act. This is a feature that has been a request made literally hundreds I'd not thousands of times.  I believe this is one particular item that people would buy atom points for.  Truthfully, tbh, tI believe they are entirely under delivering on the offerings in the store. I guess I don't know much about video game art design. I feel like I could come up with a dozen different  artwork and designs by the boatload a week. Double the amount of space you have for the store.  Put up enough cosmetics that people can truly style out with a degree of individuality. 
---
Personally, as it is now. I would purchase atom points if I found the need. The problem is, most of the time I go through the store, I want one or two things at most.  With the heavy discounts I have definitely increased the rate st which I've been spending them.  If the selection is lame, the atom point packages won't get purchased. 
---
Also, how about some silly cosmetics. Let somebody run around with a scoped Tuba or hit you with a radiated fried chicken leg that is really a dagger of some sort. People would pay for that stuff.  It might mask the actual weapon of choice until they fire/attack.  
---
I would say, all laser defenses in camp being equal, I'd pay for.a roaming Protectoron to secure my camp. That I will admit is borderline in-game non-cosmetic purchases. I guess this might be my personal desire to cloud my judgement.  Not positive, I just want a damned Protecteron who can be my rodent killer and man a vendor counter.
---
At the time when the mask dropped, i had no clue that the mask was rare. If i'd knew it was rare i'd hit that record button  :D
---
Great idea😂
---
I definitely did say "cosmetic items". Which are popular and do sell for that game. People go nuts when new ones are released.
---
Also, you can unlock those operators with points you earn in game, AND, the operators are relatively balanced and designed to have advantages and counters to each other. There's no "godd" character. Someone always has a counter to you. If you're any good you can unlock a new operator every other play session, no extra money spent.
---
You gotta play it to understand it. (Sorry thats just what it is.) Also, I switched to fallout because I'm terrible at siege. So i wouldn't call myself a seige fan per say. But I do understand it.
---
Siege also has worldwide tournaments and a MASSIVE esports following and online community. Fallout... does not. Its an adventure game. So from a merch and skins standpoint, BGS absolutely should pay attention to what they're doing. Siege is going into year 4... and they want to go to year 10! Which I doubt is even remotely planned for 76. I'd be shocked if servers don't go dark by the end of 2020. Lets hope they don't!
---
Anyway, no one read that. You all read "p2w, dude is wrong". Bye!
---
I am not angry. Also i love how balanced game is, only thing i cant get over is how much caps i lose on death. 
---
Still doesn't work for me...oh well
---
Fatman... Get to hear a nice little "ding" after.
---
&gt;obviously knew this would make people very angry, but did it anyway because they know that at the end of the day enough people will still buy the store crap to make it profitable.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;They see us as a bunch of pushovers, all talk but no real repercussions. They see us as money faucets and our angry words as unimportant.  
---
&gt;Please for the sake of the industry prove them wrong..
---
well, they pretty much drained the player base of any critical thinking at this point, the only player left will eat that shit. they ll never leave. and since the mods are doing such a shitty job keeping all the unfixed problems alive (by fear of "duplicate" ) it s not like you have a platform to share anything about this anyway. this situation is a shameless scam for the gaming community. 
---
Salt
---
Then imma just buy chunks of plastic..
---
Sadly not. It didn't take me long to get the mask, soo i didn't really know the rarity of it at the time.
---
Been waiting patiently for another chance to rip the game huh buddy? Maybe contribute something positive to this subreddit every now and then instead of of all the hate you spew every time I see you post. Never see you participate unless you can spread negativity it’s so sad.
---
When you sneak, you are not on the map. Bigger targets are people who just claimed workshop doing defense event, because you can fast travel on that event, and as they are shooting on mobs, you see exactly where they are.
---
Why you play survival when you are scared?
---
Um, so why this type of players play on survival in first place?
---
I myself spend most of my play time just roofing it across the map.
---
I've found some cool caves you can place camps in.
---
Random encounters with dead cultist that led me to a cultist meeting spot that look dedicated to the bunny-man
---
Amazingly depressing survivor stories 
---
Even some pretty cool player homes that, while not always there, are still apart of the game and some can be marvels to behold.
---
There's a bird watcher shack up near the northern part of the map that is unmarked and looks awesome, there was even a note telling to basically take it easy and watch the birds.
---
Why are they plaing on survival then?
---
Brilliant idea! This is such a worthy cause to raise awareness about and the suggested way would do it in a nice subtle way as well. 'Thumbs up!'
---
Probably for the survival challenge legendaries.
---
I don't play survival on my main but I hopped into my alt 'Sam Beckett' to get the medical malpractice legendary.
---
Well congrats, I’m just gonna let you know salty people are probably gonna report you for exploiting 😂 and say you got it from someone that went into the dev room. It’s just how it goes when people feel slighted they lash out like that. 
---
Personally I’d love to have you come by the shop sometime to draw the crowds, maybe tease em a little saying you might sell it and all the big money would be there. 
---
Did they change it? When survival beta first dropped I hit top three for surviving and even though I was out crouching in cranberry bog, hiding in the pink forest, I got blasted from behind.
---
Sacrificial blade ?
---
Making Mt Blairs out of Molerat Hills.
---
It's really just Pay 2 Be Lazy if anything. Being able to repair equipment is already something available to players in game. It's literally just a convenience to be able to do it on the go anywhere. 
---
What is an issue is if they put fridges exclusively on the Atop Shop because they're introducing an actual mechanic behind a pay wall.
---
...And even then it's arguable about how bad that would be. If it's a plan that costs 300 atoms, they're already handing out atoms on a consistent basis.
---
The conduction cost is how quickly food spoils or ferments, and how quickly a gun or armor piece deteriorates.
---
I’m not sure what you mean with the second part. The fermenter is linked with your player inventory so you can access your player inventory. 
---
8mm Mauser actually. (7.92×57mm).  A MG42 chambered for 7.62x51mm NATO is the MG3. 
---
So you have alt, with not much loot and you don't even try to fight, alt+f4 in any dangerous situation?
---
Yep I have the same thing- didn’t play during beta and yet have 3 locations challenges that haven’t worked (mire, toxic valley, cranberry bog) one of the places in the cranberry bog I only just discovered a few weeks ago and it still didn’t count to the challenge :(
---
My hometown is Portsmouth UK, we have the historic dockyards with hms victory and hms warrior in. So a raider faction based there who dress in old timey admiral and redcoat gear who worship admiral Nelson (there are statues of him everywhere).
---
Whale Island which is a military base and the actual Royal navy port (lots of robots and techy stuff).
---
Giant IBM building, tech research. They develop radar and all that crap. 
---
I got 11 and then 12kills. There was visible mostly one of 3top living players, never all three. Maybe you was unlucky and someone walking around spoted you. Or idk.
---
The problem for them is ranger armour isn't something you buy repeatedly. Each person gets it a maximum of once and that's it. They need something we'll buy more than once and the only way to do that is to make it consumable in some way. hence these kits. they are used once and gone.
---
I can't really think of something to suggest instead but ranger armour is not the same thing at all.
---
No I have an alt with a ton of junk I'm collecting for when you can do decorations at camp.
---
And I can't alt+F4 I'm on PS4, I just finish what ever quest I'm doing and open up the game menu, navigate to the top where my username is, select the leave world option.
---
Just because I don't really do survival doesn't mean I don't understand the inherent risks of playing it, I don't log out just because someone is coming up behind me.
---
 I fight back and if I die, well then I die and lose my stuff.
---
I move on and don't get salty about it, its just junk and time wasted. I can make up the time and junk any time.
---
Maybe, I've also seen people here and on Twitter reporting this as a bug where they don't show, so who knows?
---
And you’ve just proven my whole point lmao.
---
I literally said I don’t defend their practice or agree with it. I’m not some dumbass that thinks it’s the reason why games are in some terrible state and will rant on about it for infinity with a metric fuck ton of salt.
---
I’m a guy that buys and plays games I enjoy ? Because I want to. The fact of the matter is the game still has content, the base game has maybe not enough for 60 dollars if you play and drop but the dlc will make up for that over time, luckily I got it when it was cheap.
---
Whether or not you buy, whether or not you engage and whether or not you scream and get mad about it on internet echo chamber forums the reality of FO76 and games like this is there.
---
The more you bash games like this that are not common the more you kill gaming by not praising the actual good practice. When we just see “DAE EA AND BETHESDA TRASH” that’s all people see, people make there own informed decision giving these games sales lmao.
---
Let’s call out what we don’t like, enjoy what we enjoy and actually praise the companies doing good. 
---
“How far do your standards have to drop?” At lease I’m not some stuck up cuck that doesn’t understand what fun is. 
---
They’re are still many more games that aren’t early access and etc that do well (in respect to scale don’t assume bc a game isn’t front page everywhere it didn’t do well). And I play through enjoy them and have fun bc that’s what games are about. I’m not spending money on the atomic shop and etc bc I don’t want to buy that content or propel Bethesda. But if I play the game (that ftr I have had literally no crashes and only a couple server issues in my time playing), and enjoy it then. I’m just gonna enjoy it.
---
If you want more people to actually agree with you and “stop ruining the market” then don’t treat them like shit, like they’re stupid and killing it. Share your opinion and let people be people. All you’ve done is fall for everything I’ve said got more salty and proven my point.
---
That was fantastic haha good job
---
The play has gotten better. I really enjoy this game in spite of it's failures. sometimes it reverts to shittyness because reasons! the bag debacle has nothing to do with game play. that's a different story, and has nothing to do with the game itself. however, if something that is not part of the game bothers you that much, fo76 is probably not for you. they seem to have non game effecting PR fiascos on a weekly basis.
---
if you look in the discussion on that page or even google "epic games store stealing steam info" you'll find plenty of proof. being too lazy to search yourself is no excuse.
---
Thats what Im talking about. I wouldnt even mind the stats just as long as it looks good.
---
I've been a fan since I started playing Fallout 3 a decade ago. I do like this game, but I really don't care about PvP. 
---
Yes it works and melts them like butter I say and watched my friend eat assasin/sent alive last night
---
No. They said it’s one of many good places to leave feedback. They never said it’s the best.
---
Absolutely true, I've always been about 'fashion souls' since before 'FashionSouls' was A thing
---
Aesthetics before practicality I always say.
---
What do you mean by "long time"?  Since FO3?  Since FO1?  "Have played FO:BOS"?
---
Why are you defending a thief?
---
My goal is not to rubb it in people's faces. i just wanted to show people that it actually exists etc. But alot of people seem angry and jealous about it..
---
PA in PvP is like suicide.
---
You won't get a refund, but you could fairly easily respec your character and try something different, TSE was just one type of play style.
---
You've bought the product get some use out of it :)
---
Stop yelling. 
---
Because I saw the wolves doing it after I sobered up.
---
Yeah there is in some of the deeper water.
---
Think the theme of the game shows the path we are on
---
right on! that's only the second rare that I have seen. both have been ol'e man winter. 
---
Oh what is this Player radio :O
---
*Turns it on
---
"MOM!!!, IM PLAYING CAN YOU COME BACK LATER"
---
"ITS EITHER YOU HELP ME HERE OR YOU'RE BANNED ON PLAYING ON YOUR COMPUTER"
---
Turns back on Appalachia Radio
---
i saw one at the edge of the map
---
There are tiny little fish swimming around. Nothing you can interact with to my knowledge 
---
Hey I’m sorry if I’m giving that vibe because I’m always excited when my buddies get dope loot, a little jealous yeah, but happy for you mainly. If you followed the threads during the event people were pretty pissed at the drop rates and even tho it’s not fair, people will probably accuse you of those things without the video proof of the drop. It’s sucks man but just block the haters out and bask in the glow of the RNG gods cause you hit the jackpot!
---
&gt;lvl 91 glowing deathclaws
---
I chased one across and out of Whitespring it was funny trying to hit its tail with my mutants switch blade, sometimes it stopped and looked at me but then ran off again like a frightened puppy, never attacked, probably a glitch or something.
---
Fatman because of the wind up on the mini. 
---
Why not? It's a poor excuse but the game allows you to do it, why wouldn't you take every advantage you can?
---
I've seen people post on this sub that all you have to do is pop over to adventure and have a friend kill you, the cap penalty is far less and it resets your leaderboard status when jumping back.
---
it looked like an anchovy but just a bit bigger
---
Agreed.
---
Or we can keep politics in politics and let the people have a hobby that doesn't get ruined by virtue signaling. Let people have fun and get away from politics for a change. I know all the people are gonna say "but *sniff* fallout is political". Yes it's a made up political world. Not the real political world. People don't want to worry about real politics in video games. Also fallout is hardly political considering there is no government or political parties left after everyone got nuked. Keep your virtue signaling on Facebook and twitter and out of our video games thanks.
---
Thanks dude! I appreciated the love instead of the hate &lt;3
---
Of all the things I’ve read in this sub, this is far and away the most intelligent thing anyone’s posted. This is a great idea, and I hope everyone at BGS sees this post!
---
"Nerfed" White Knight?  It was ludicrously over powered, it's still pretty useful.
---
It is a bug. As soon the first place left the server, the second one becomes his place, but only in the list. On still stays second on the map, thats why you mostly never see everyone on the map. This is already tried many times and reported to the devs.
---
Agreed. I didn’t like his argument either no matter how well thought it is it’s still wrong. 
---
Ok cool. Join my game gt LordRazumdar 
---
where did you see the other one? Im curious who's my co-successor :D
---
the basic kits are cash buy only. the improved ones are supposedly able to be gained in-game, but they'll most likely be stupid rare like the masks were or something.
---
they are technically pay to win because they DO provide an advantage. Not a major advantage, but this could open the door for worse.
---
How to get trihards out of your base while you rig up the artillery and defences 
---
You know they're coming back at you if they get nukashined out of there 
---
I don't think that they drop past 3\* the 4th can be had by adding a mod, and as far as I know 5\* has never been seen. 
---
Yeah I figured as such, because the few times I went on survival, one and two weren't visible but 3 was.
---
I have a second character that is lvl 32 right know, and i only use it for survival mode :D It is a no caps and no meds run. Just want so see how far i can go.
---
Take out the pick locks and those 3 points could be used somewhere else, like nerd rage or something. You only need them to pick locks, not run around with. 
---
Then why did you come up with the conspiracy theory?
---
Still...this would be an amazingly fun thing...especially for griefers.....Bye Bye!!!!
---
I agree. 
---
I am not salty, i am just asking, people here are salty instantly downvoting.
---
So you are part of people i get, doing just things to do survival challenge and then login of.
---
I don't get people who play hour on survival like it is adventure and when they meet someone they instantly go to desktop (or kill game by PS button).
---
Yes please make me aware that BY MYSELF I contribute 1,700 PLASTIC water bottles to the landfill/environment annually. You read that right ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED plastic bottles annually.  And I am also aware that I do not GIVE A FUCK!! 
---
How about a Chicken Morph syringer!
---
Fuck.  Off.
---
There's some at Crevasse dam lake. But there is picture of a fish on the map there as well 😆
---
Can you imagine tagging a lvl 2 straight out the vault? 😂 💀 they wake up in the cranberry bog with a scorchbeast circling above them... so griefy but so funny too.
---
I'd love the modding community to be able to do things in fo76 but i honestly can't see it happening any time soon or in the foreseeable future if I'm honest.
---
Unless these modders are part of the vetted creation club it won't happen, Bethesda only cares about getting players money when and wherever they can it seems. If mods come and they are free there's no gain for Bethesda hence we havnt got them.
---
If Bethesda really cared about its player base over rl money we wouldn't be getting ammo converters, fridges or repair kits  possibly in the atom shop, these items would've been introduced into the game for free or introduced and built in into existing mechanics.
---
Why in other fallout titles were we allowed to buy AND sell ammo and even break them down and yet  in fallout 76 we cant?
---
Why nerf armor and weapon condition and increase the rate of food items spoiling? 
---
They did all these because they knew they were implementing these items, all they are is a shady practice to yet sponge more money/atoms out of the player base still playing this game( myself included) over mechanics that really should've been in the game to start off with.
---
I love this game but I am seriously hating the direction Bethesda is pushing the game towards, I understand they are a business and need as much capital out of their  product as possible but there are better, less shady, ways of going around this than the current way there implimenting
---
Ah, yes, that was it, thanks. :)
---
It's just a mislabeled corpse there is a dead radstag on the big bridge near flatwoods named brahmim
---
Oh sorry I wasn't specifically meaning you when I said 'getting salty' I've seen a LOT of salty posts about the survival stuff.
---
I think the biggest issue some people have is Bethesda said that Survival is supposed to be adventure mode with events and quests but pvp is on all the time, no slap damage just true damage. That Survival is Just a harsher version of adventure.
---
It also doesn't that Fallout 4's survival mode was exactly that, just a harsher version of the base game.
---
To annoy you.
---
I'm a smidge younger than the average fallout fan (judging by the responses here). Started with Fallout 3 GOTY on 360 and fell in love with the series. Put probably about a thousand hours across console and PC NV. Went and bought a special edition mini nuke which contained the series and absolutely enjoy it. Fallout 1 and 2 are peerless (the conversation with the Master still blows me away with the multiple voices, along with helping the NCR in 2).
---
Tactics is okay for what it is. 4 has poorer writing but much better gameplay of all the Beth fallouts. 76 is just fine. Have about 100 hours in it now. Bad launch for sure, but the little tweaks improve the game and I'm a sucker for inventory management. 
---
Shoot stuff and don't die....
---
Loot stuff and break it down before putting it in your stash. It saves a LOT of room.
---
In the top left corner of the map there is sometimes an event called leader of the pack (I think) it will give you a few low level legendary items which is a great boost.
---
I kill people only once, there is no reason to grief.
---
But i kill on sight because everyone can kill you. Try getting blackpowder rifle. Maybe two, it will kill even high levels.
---
That's because they knew New Vegas made by Obsidion was just better and what fans actually wanted plus the DLCs were amazing.
---
Cheers
---
I got you SEANZY 123 join me :) 
---
Ha ha ha, is this before or after your drink the radiated water and collect bones from human beings who have been eaten from mutated monsters created by the government or whoever? Think the notion will be lost on most players though a noble idea.
---
Oh the player in me knows that it's just a bug in the code.
---
But the character in me?
---
The character only sees the corpse of a death claw turned Traveling Merchant, trying to sell his wares with his mate ( I always find another deathclaw nearby) and some poor sod didn't realize that and cut the beasty down.
---
I invited you it wouldn’t let me join
---
That’s awesome you got one! I’d be careful lending it out for pictures. Someone’s likely to snatch it and skedaddle. 
---
Still op and the weapon of choice for survival. 
---
Thats ok.
---
People will be complaing about anything. 
---
And yeah you can do events and quest, buy you must know how, every time have high ground,....
---
Fo4 was too easy even on survival. Haha
---
That's a great idea.  I can just see the inauguration scene, chief justice gets you to swear in, then gives you complementary voucher for a fridge.  Trump would have loved it.  
---
Your best bet for farming is to learn all the armor spawns in the Mire,  then check and server hop till you find stuff you don't know. CBA plans tend to not drop from the cranberry bog. And as someone mentioned,  you got a low chance to get them from deconstructing combat armors.  But it's the same trash RNG as the Radium rifle mods. 
---
Yes please 
---
It’s because that’s where they will add new locations 
---
Yep, those have been in the game since beta
---
ahh allright thanks!
---
I do not buy plastic water bottle, I am lucky to live in a country that has drinkable tap water so I just use reusable water flasks. And I am also aware that I absolutely GIVE A FUCK!!
---
We only have one planet asshole!!
---
on pc you can already ajust the ini file and make it a different color but it changes the color for other players
---
Oh im not letting people use it! Thats just a crazy thought! 
---
It hasnt been released yet, couple months back some people got to a devroom and took the plans from there so its not in the game yet
---
I disagree. It’s not about the “server” it’s about the life. If you haven’t died yet I see no reason why it all shouldn’t carry over. That is after all the point of survival.
---

You can't repair weapons without a repair bench. Take silos for example a player without a repair kit cannot repair without leaving the instance, a player with can. While it's not a huge advantage, it is an advantage!
---
Because survival is about living the longest. If what you ask for actually worked then it would be a way for people to negate the risk of survival. And I’m glad you can’t.
---
I think what could have lessened some of the hate is if they had just called the survival beta what it is, deathmatch free-for-all
---
Certainly you could adventure in it as it is now, but I see more people having fun just going to duke it out.
---
Pvp is fun and can be intense, I just think they misstepped with the naming, and it *is* still in beta so, who knows? It could get better or worse.
---
Your Welcome!
---
Flair checks out.
---
Make healing salve if you are needing free healing aid. Equip green thumb if available before you farm the material. Enjoy
---
the other one was here on reddit [https://i.redd.it/e5ys2iumxdn21.jpg](https://i.redd.it/e5ys2iumxdn21.jpg) I saw a few other posts while I was looking for that one. they all seem to be that mask. It must be luck! I personally did the event over 100 times and got the same ones over and over, or nothing at all which was worse. I didn't even get all of the plans. fml!
---
Yep. Common practice for theses types of games, to offer paid dlc. Theses games are made with longevity in mind. It’d be dlc worth paying for if someone would want it. Chin up bud, plenty to be cynical about 
---
Only people who have that are cheaters 
---
Oh that user i on playstion :o Im on xbox
---
You could've been the one that led the wolves there during the blackout.
---
You play on xbox? i most likely have the plans you need :3
---
I wanna put shito. Shelves, add that to A shop
---
Lord how has this ended up in the popular section, you soy milk drinking fairies 
---
That's the whole point of the outrage orgasm.
---
I'm confused. Gibbing is still in game. I've shot off heads and use bloody mess which causes the classic gore chunk pile.
---
Some People do crappy things , some don’t. Doesn’t mean we shouldn’t do something because a few would use it a way the many wouldn’t 
---
Not even close, a solid vats crit could take you down, a couple shots to stagger you and I could slice thru that armor like butter. It’s definitely a good set tho and will give you an extra second or two that could be the deciding factor, but if you’re going up against an experienced PvP player there are a lot of ways you could be taken down. 
---
Just keep playing and paying. There are no issues on Bethesda side. All the issues are on the players side who pretend this is good or will be a good game in the future. I love to see after one year how many fanatic fans are still believing to this train wreck.
---
Scrap everything so later on you have a nice bit of mats to use
---
Thank you
---
What Platform? If your on PS4 I can hook you up with some stuff? A good gun, armor, and some aid
---
Theres like an upstairs that's it's probably supporting. But I literally took out the wall next to it and it was fine. So it works I just moved the stairs. I run around so sporadically that I never get through doorways the first time so I just do away with them when I can
---
Consider that dedicated servers could be a thing eventually and players won’t have to worry about having that sort of element 
---
Nah it’s Xbox 
---
the first explosion breaks it up and does no damage then all the small bits explode 
---
I have max rank grenader and explosive expert and they are amazing
---
Bummer
---
But thanks though 
---
Boiling frog teory.. 
---
Yeah, I have drinkable tap water in all locations that I travel too. But it is just something about that plastic water bottle. Maybe it is because you do not have to carry a cup around when driving and instead if remembering to bring the cup inside when you arrive at the destination, you can just throw the plastic bottle out the window while commuting. Conveniency and efficiency at its finest. 
---
I understand. Most likely it and the wall next to it were holding up the upper floor and the game let you take out all but one. 
---
I got plans for it I can make it
---
Turn the radio off or take over the station. 
---
Yesssir

Just drop some lego's
---
No. I‘m running a full set and i regularly die. Of course it is a good armor but far away from being as op as some people in here complain about...
---
Minigun. With fireproof perk and dense chest mod mini nukes are really weak making fatman obsolete after explosive nerf.
---
Wont matter that much, agreed previous comment. 
---
That answers that. Thanks. I wonder how THEY do it?
---
Yes, if they're vertibirds
---
That’s what I thought you meant by “taking a quick picture with the mask”. Lol 
---
Still playing from time to time. Certainly wouldn't call myself a long-time fan. My first Fallout was Fallout 4, never played another one before that sadly.
---
I'm all for more raider junk. Sure, I'm supposed to be one of the best and brightest, but after enough radiation and disease I may have went a little feral. I'm half way to being a ghoul. Sun kissed, ghoulish &amp; cannibal. I eat whenever the fuck I want. Your flesh sustains me. 
---
Hanging out with Rose didn't help matters. 
---
you have already paid them. they no longer care about u, lol
---
I like the Gatling laser since ammo is cheap and the gun itself is accurate with fair damage.  Not to mention fun to me personally!
---
Take over a power plant, power up the fusion generator and in 20 minutes you’ll have 3 cores. 
---
Get the “power user” perk and it doubles your clip size from 500 to 1000. Repair to 200% using weapon artisan and you’re good to go for a long time
---
Which one? They are all prefixes.
---
Not possible. Vampiric and bloodied are both 1st prefixes
---
Australia?
---
Bethesda said they might add repair kits and improved repair kits. Repair kits are only buyable with atoms iirc, but the improved kind is droppable by the SBQ. They both repair your gear.
---
Yeah but it still hasnt been released. Ypu only have to scrap one to get the plans 
---
Outsmarting an idiot and taking is caps is not the same as trying to destroy someone's life and the life of a child because you lost currency in a game
---
Who’s they?
---
Looking at the M79 on day one and it just reads "Explosive, Heavy weapon, shotfun".
---
Is the deathclaw gauntlet still bugged to receive benefits from both iron fist and gladiator?
---
Or don’t sit slowly and calmly like you where in a fucking spa.
---
Oh ok 
---
If you really consider theft being smart, your moral compass is broken. I trusted someone who ended up not being trustworthy. That's all.
---
I was meaning that they they could take a picture with me :) Sorry im not the best with words
---
I know in the beginning you're probably broke but whatever it cost to get into a nuke zone do it get yourself a hazmat soon ASAP don't bring any junk with you and don't even worry about aid. Just get in there and shoot everything once. You're going to die over and over that's fine just shoot everything you see one time at least so you get all that experience.
---
I got my Elder paint a week or so ago after turning in 50+ times since Paladin
---
Since then I have done roughly 25 more separate turn ins of varying amounts (1-5 Tech Data collections per time) and have not received anything beyond outfits and legendary heavy combat armor pieces.
---
Get fucked OP keep your politics to yourself.
---
I am playing since Fallout 1 :)
---
The best way to go about it would be in White springs by throwing Molotov cocktails into groups of ghouls. Depending on your intelligence this will get you thousands of experience! Literally one molotov can get you up a couple levels if you are low enough and Molotov cocktail are easy enough for any beginner to craft in volume
---
&gt;So as we all know Srivival mode is for assholes only who enjoy pvp but play this game because they just want to jump and 1 shot you, because in other games they get constantly owned and cry all the time.
---
Lost me there pal. I see from your opening remarks that this will be the rant of a whiny child.
---
I'M TELLING YOU IT WASN'T ME
---
Make a new dummy character and equip him with the weapons to do that quest again. Once he earns it, swap equipment and uniform back to your main character. 
---
Found a griefer who sits in the corner of his camp after a kill, or immediately disconnects because he's afraid of getting owned.
---
Then run and hide! Also if you see any legendaries make sure you find where that body dropped and pick up their loot you'll get legendaries and if you get a good drop it could set you up with thousands of caps which would be game-changing for a new person!
---
They did mention a few places, but singled out Reddit in the first place.
---
Todd Howard (when asked where is the best place to leave feedback): “Probably Reddit is the best place”. 
---
Direct quote from the panel. 16:45 in, if you want to go back and fact-check me 😉
---
In any case, the commenter that I was replying to had doubted if BGS ever saw feedback from Reddit at all. Clearly they do.
---
No in fact, I play survival mode not for the PvP but just for the thrill. I just run around and do my thing and then i enjoy that rush when I realize I'm number one on the map only when it's too late and I'm being hunted down. It's a blast.
---
You are generalizing, and being quite a dick about it. You can offer feedback and criticism in a less caustic way.
---
Q: How can someone on PS4/Xbox get a PC/Dev item?
---
A: You Can't. It's PC/Dev Room only.
---
Graham’s has many plans that only spawn on him, every player will have a few rare plans that won’t spawn for them regularly, I sell Grahm Plans and farm him a lot, like a lot a lot haha. Sometimes I’ll relog his inventory 100 times and get two radiation emitters etc. All CAMP plans are obtainable, I completed my set almost three months ago now and have sold many ppl their last plans :) 
---
Sounds great! 👍
---
Joins PvP server &gt; gets ripped &gt; tries putting bounties on people &gt; still can't kill em &gt; takes to Reddit with rage
---
The TLDR for anyone wondering
---
Fridges? Totally missed that one. What’s the summary?
---
I'd probably pay for infinite storage 🙊
---
I don't think there is any kind of order as to what loot drops as reward, you are just as likely to get the same paint plans again, or a Bomber Jacket, or a Scribe Uniform, or nothing. Just RNG doing its job.
---
The power and purifiers are skins. You need the plan to use them, which is found in game.
---
Yes, if they were Vertibirds. 
---
Everyone hates that they made them so rare but I think it’s kinda cool that you are a celebrity for having it. Also if I were you I’d be trying to sell it for real cash. 
---
Oh true ive got tons of them
---
Yeah, nice lies, you support ultra-griefer friendly mechanics. I can tell you haven't tried to start a new char on survival.
---
You need a solid slap in the neck and some friends.
---
Ya.  I found some a short time ago in the Atlas Observatory.  
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b7tqcs/for_the_first_time_since_the_vendor_plan_update_i/
---
First time I had seen them in game since the vendor update in Patch 5.
---
These things are stupidly rare since the patch and it makes gear progression difficult for new players.  Trying to find Combat Armor BOS and Deep Pocketed Plans was so much easier when they were available via server hopping at vendors.  Now players who don’t already know them are at a disadvantage.  
---

Oh it's fun to witness the rage of a sexually frustrated,  mentally small person on the internet. Never gets old.
---
That last part is what i needed to know. 
---
Perhaps there is a correlation. Obviously everything should just be unlocked through the game, and I hate the fact that some really nice stuff can sometimes appear in the Atomic shop.
---
Still better than your PvP skills 🤷
---
I 'm a Fallout Vet. I guess. I started wit Fo3, but went back and played the other titles to get the full story.
---
I have noticed the same thing. I try play the game like I play the other FO games. Most of the folks that I have teamed up with have been call of duty types. not my thing, my life is stressful enough as it is. Some of them have been really cool though. One guy only pops up every couple of weeks, and is a delight to play with once he realizes that we don't have to grind for "legendary gear" all of the time. 
---
Playing FO with others has been a strange trip. I enjoy the company, but i'm annoyed that I can't stuff my junk into their inventory when I'm over encumbered. lol!  
---
It's bad for either to be there, it's just less bad when it's cosmetic.
---
People who use the phrase “virtue signaling” unironically tend to be unpleasant 
---
I had no idea we're talking about you and your Freddy.
---
Don't just leave weapons. Scrap everything to learn mods and get materials.
---
Don't keep non-legendary weapons higher than your LVL, it will waste space and you'll find more later on.
---
Use the nukesanddragons perk planner to plan your build. You don't want to waste perk points/card choices on useless cards. Decide your specific build and the perks that will go with it.
---
Once you start moving all over the map for quests, put your base in a central location like top of the world, to make it cheaper for fast traveling to locations
---
You can make 1400caps a day by selling stuff to the 7 different vendors every 24 hours.

How did fo76 even get to 170,000 players?
---
Ya man I remember the times when you buy a game you got the whole game 
---
You’re doin ok buddy. As far as politics being in games, if you already enjoy fallout despite the allegorical references to current society, I don’t think that would change if mirelurks dropped plastic 
---
Go die in a mass shooting already, bring your family with you.
---
&gt; You can even get the Nuka Dark recepie from BIV,
---
Nuka Dark was one of the first recipes Biv gave me, nothing curious or rare about that I figure. 
---
@zirfeld: Either you are extremely unlucky or something is broken in your game; I have always got a recipe from Biv except maybe once, and I think my list is almost complete. I had only two or three duplicates until now, too, so the RNG for this quest looks a bit more controlled than others'.
---
I agree with you that's why I don't play fortnite because it's become a cash cow not a game and it's slowly f76 is becoming this way
---
Yes there is reoccurring missions all over the map that go away after a day if you do not complete. But you can go back and get another quest. 
---
To know if your are dealing with a broken game or not, we need evidence on what quest is in question.  Then people can help. 
---
I feel bad for the 3 and a half people still playing this
---
LOL umad?
---
It really depends on what kind of damage you want to do.

If you want to have a variety of builds to swap between on the same character, you should do a strength build as a melee, heavy gunner and shotgun build are all in the strength category, meaning that the perks can be swapped in the same SPECIAL point. 
---
When we bought games, they were subscription based if they were online.  There is an ongoing cost there.  Pick your poison.
---
More like I'm sick of people with genetic predispositions of spreading stupidity (your genetic line), there's a chance mass shooters do something good actually by killing people like you for example.
---
Just a note.  The BOS mods for combat armor cannot be learned by scrapping.  Deep Pocketed cannot either.
---
You must find the plans to learn these mods  
---
And you can have a “Brotherhood of Steel” pop up while scrapping combat armor but this is the cosmetic paint option for the Combat Armor Helmet.  Not to be confused with an actual BOS mod.  
---
They are on PC, some ppl got them from the dev room, gave them away and when scrapped learned to craft them. The person who took them would have been banned but a few of the people that were given the helmet and scrapped it are not. Beth said they had no plans of banning these few people 
---
 I think you need to complete recruitment blues before you can enter. If you're not sure use a walkthrough to tell you where to go, often the map markers are unreliable in the game
---
This was not a BOS mod.  It was the paint for the Combat Armor Helmet.  It is learned randomly by scrapping any combat armor. 
---
You can learn mods from any piece.  It is not specific to the type.  So scrapping a chest piece does not always give you Chest mods.  
---
My buddy and I say this all the time.  No patches, items, or dlc.  It was complete and functional. 
---
Please see a therapist. 
---
I think thats why its important now more than ever that older gamers keep fighting this system. Kids shouldnt have to spend extra in a game to get the rest of the game after spending $60.
---
"For the times they are a-changin". I too dislike the atom shop for the same reason.
---
I laughed, but this is actually kinda brilliant and I hope they listen.
---
&gt; it lets them keep up with the dimwits that spend all day on the game and think everybody should put in as much time as them.
---
By paying money. What is wrong with you people? The whole point is that this problem should be solved by an actual game mechanic or something, not through a fucking micotransaction shop. The game already costs 60 bucks, why the fuck should anyone be paying more for this shit?
---
There's also the fact that this game's reputation is already in the toilet, it really doesn't need to look any worse.
---
As an older gamer I kinda like the convenience of the repair kit. as long as it doesn’t effect pvp , I’m fine with repair kits or Xp boosts. They give you free atoms and the people that are spending rl money are giving Beth incentive to keep adding content 
---
Yup it is. Source it was data mined and Laos happened to me in order.
---
How about if you eat Mirelurk steaks you get mercury poisoning. 
---
Why? I'm one of very few that's actually awoke and sees how shit humans are.
---
You definitely mad tho 😂😂😂
---
The thing is though even these days if you buy a game it should be functional, and most of them are, but Fallout 76 wasn't :-(
---
Scrapping teslas does not help?
---
Those expansion packs for MARIO were lit to
---
Define younger gamers? People under the age of 18 who do not know the value of a dollar? Or under 25? Or under 30?  
---
But you could be right. When we see the kids hat are 8 now grow older, then they will always expect games to have it and be okay with it.  Look at fortnite.  More kids are playing that than anything.  Micro transactions are making bank for fortnite. But again it’s also a bunch of little kids. 
---
There was a story of a 10 year old or something charging his parents credit card for over $1,000. Not knowing he was even spending money. 
---
So there is a point where you have to teach 8 year olds the value of a dollar and budgeting. And then maybe they realize at some time that buying cowboy hats for $5 on a video game isn’t smart. 
---
Totally agree with this statement. If you want to play WoW you'd have to buy the full game (with all the expansion packs) and THEN pay for a subscription to enjoy fully-unlocked game.
---
I like games that are pay-2-play (like Black Desert Online or Diablo 3) where it's your choice to throw some more money at it if you're enjoying the game so much. It's up to you if wish to stop playing and then start again in a few weeks/months.
---
Go outside if you’re getting upset at the computer.
---
Everyone I know has received them in the same order, and never duplicated (at least if they learned the paint right away, which they always did).  That would be quite the RNG feat to do without a set order being programmed in.  
---
Just got in my truck to go to the store for another case of water for the week. Guess what I found in the cup holder. A plastic water bottle, guess where it is at now. Out the window and probably landed in a ditch. 
---
I’m not saying it isn’t a problem. I just refuse to be dramatic about it. Either they’ll use this as an opportunity to go full on P2W, or they’ll acknowledge community outrage and remedy the issue. Have anything of substance to add, or was critiquing my lack of vocal outrage enough, lol...
---
You speaking from my heart! I really want to chase others in Raider PA with a chainsaw/pipe rifle/flamethrower.
---
I totally agree. Watched a very good documentary last night on Netflix. "Our Planet", narrated by the one and only David Attenborough. Unfortunately the vast majority of people who live on our planet have zero respect for it.
---
Good I loved that car just hated if ya got to the job town that end game quest break car retrieval
---
Ya.  Only while in game.  It uses the Spoil Condition system in game.
---
Most everything only happens while in game.  Extraction and Water Purifiers in your Camp also only accumulate when you are logged in.    
---
I'd definitely agree, though to me what it says is that as much as you might not like it, it's the direction of modern gaming and your best option is to find acceptable middle ground rather than taking a hard stance on things to force a game to try to go back to a method of selling that hasn't been standard for over a decade. 
---
People think spending $60 or so on a game is a "I've paid enough" but frankly modern games have a lot more expectations than previous.
---
When the original NES came out, games were $30-$60. How much are games now? $30-60 but we're all internet connected now. If you made a game and it had horrible game breaking bugs, that was it, you weren't getting a replacement or bug fixes, you just had to learn to work around it and not break your own game. Costs have skyrocketed in expenses to produce the games but returns haven't. So game developers have to find ways other than just sales on front to make some sustainable income even just to "keep the lights on" as far as servers, maintenance, operations.... That doesn't even include new content generation. 
---
We are getting some great patches here soon, and while news of these changes might be bringing on some new players, most I'd say are still original purchases. So how do we genuinely expect them to keep chugging out more awesome content when they already said all the DLC and patches would be free unlike previous FO DLC where we'd be paying $10-30 a piece. 
---
I know that gamers on this sub and most gaming subs seem to have a mental brick wall when it comes to this, but the alternative is that games have to start charging subscription fees and that to me is far worse option. 
---
The store model realizes that the vast majority of people aren't going to buy anything ever, the next sizable chunk may buy one or two really important items over the life of their account, and the last small few are the whales who will just spend endlessly and personally, I can be fine with things on the current blueprint that way. 
---
Meaning, if whale a just says, I want to play the game but I'm limited on time and I really don't want to grind for mats, I just want to go do raids or explore. Okay. Then here's your atom sink to just buy one time use repair mats. Especially when it gives no boosts to quality, only repairing to 100% whereas the version that's a drop in game is a boost and repairs to 150% and can't be purchased. I think that's a good compromise. 
---
Another point I made earlier is that no matter how cool of a cosmetic is, some people will just never buy anything cosmetic.  They don't care about hairstyles or skins. So having simple QoL stuff like this that they can blow their ever piling up free atoms we get daily, again, personally I don't have a problem with it. 
---
Now if this was spend atoms on a lvl 100 3* legendary armor and weapon bundle... that to me I'd be annoyed with... But this? This to me seems irrelevant and that most people complaining are even admitting that the "bonus" if there is one is negligible but they're just fighting it on principle and that seems like just throwing a temper tantrum. 
---
Well I hope you get cancer one day and nobody will get a broken dime for you.
---
Send me a message where you'll be so I can come there and laugh at your fat face when you die from your own weapon.
---
I enjoy the game thoroughly. It’s not without issue. But this is not a new concept. Quite a few online games have QoL micros that nobody bats an eye at. If you’ve never played a true mmo, then I can understand why you’re confused. But I promise this isn’t some crazy thing that only bethesda **MIGHT** implement. It’s also not even close to new. AND nobody seems to mind in these other games.
---
I feel like the people upset about this are the same people that hate the game anyway.
---
Also. Atoms are free. And piss easy to get. Some people may feel like a purchase is justified. Some people might not. And thats okay. As long as these items arent REQUIRED for progression it’s seriously not that big of a deal.
---
&gt;Bethesda has earned my trust.  People need to be more patient.
---
Please tell me that was a stupid joke...
---
If not, you're beyond lost.
---
That's the point. Fighting against a level 20 or 30 Colonel gutsy is ridiculous! Even in Numbers! 
---
I'd rather have this guy on my server than a dude with a 600 cap bounty who stands on a tower in the middle of the map with sentinel/assassin just spamming his TSE shotgun on anything that moves on the ground.
---
That isn't true but the loot part should be adjusted. 
---
I'm not a lawyer, but I think we can overlook that in the wasteland... I'll be handling your divorce. What are your grievances and how much did he contribute to the marital junk? If he made you stay home to cook the scorchbeast lung, craft the alcohol, and fix his gear, you may be entitled to more than half his junk since he has more junk gathering experience than you. You want the nicer set of PA? Can do, honey. We're gonna take him for all he's worth.
---
I currently run with about 4 weapons, a Gattling Plasma for funzies (It's bugged at the mo so it has no projectiles, who knows where it will go haha) and it hits pretty hard and ammo wise it's pretty efficient.
---
Then image my main which is a 2* 50cal as the ammo is super easy to make a tone of and it's a pretty beastly gun. 
---
Then a tri-battled minigun but I seldom use it except for fun, need a decent legendary version.
---
The MG42 sits there but I rarely main it, and if I do it's against mid level enemies it can 2-3 shot, never against big things like SB, that's the 50cal's job.
---
And lastly I have a lvl50 All Rise for general purpose low level smashing like bugs, rats, and other low level things I don't deem worthy of reviving my hard earned hot lead 😁
---
I don't agree with the generational divide theory I'm 34 and I see the atom shop as okay. Now let me say I don't want to buy everything in it or think I need it but I look at it this way. The video game market has not really felt the effects of inflation like most other markets. Fallout 1 probably didn't cost half as much to make but released for around $60. So I agree to keep the price down hit me with things I don't need but maybe want for a little extra money. 
---
Those people I go up to with a bloodied knife and do absolutely no damage. 
---
I think we need more perk cards that have a synergy when equipped together. Like having a passive and an active perk card at the same time would give you an extra benefit of some kind.
---
Get me a flamethrower and adresses of redditors first then I can have a nice walk with the dirt of the earth.
---
Yes, it is PC only. However,  it is not just dev room (common mistake) it was in beta and removed when beta ended. Beta players retained the helmet and that is how some players have it. Nice thing about it is, when scrapped it always generates plans.
---
Have you ever heard of emulation? Every game from the N64/PS1 era back is available for free for very little effort.
---
the only thing to come from Todd's mouth is lies, I don't think he knows the meaning of truth anymore. Bethesda is utter shit now and can join all the other shit companies out there like Bioware, EA, Activision/Blizzard.
---
I’m not questioning if the game is broken I’m just asking for some insight to how things work, iv just noticed some missions disappear, like I said I can’t play a lot so names of missions I can’t remember, the reason Iv finally decided to ask is a mission I think I picked up during cold case, I was on my way to north East part of the map but had to stop playing so I set up camp on a cliff and my camp basically faced the round space station,  
---
Anyway iv went back to it today and the mission I was doing is now gone, I think I was fixing things for tourism or something but not sure, I just want some tips on how to figure out how things work, In all the other games you could take weeks away from playing and just pick up where you left off, this game though if you take a week off then come back it’s completely different, any advice at all for this game would be fantastic 
---
I could be wrong but I thought I read somewhere it wasn't a pc only problem. 
---
Wrong, do your research. 
---
Well if it is a mission that disappears, usually it will say “[daily]” in front of it 
---
How about no ? Keep your political activism out of games pls.
---
Yeah, daily quests are really frustrating if you are like me and can't fast travel. They are typically fetch requests requiring travel to far-flung corners of the map. Which is fine if you can fast travel. But if you're encumbered you have to walk there which is not something you can get done in an hour. Also, it's very hard to get some of them to restart when you do have the time (e.g., the boarding school event has only ever happened once for me and I've never been able to get it to fire up again).

I’ve always wanted more content with Rose, kind of like the Enclave events but Raider events. She has control of the region’s broadcast, doesn’t seem too far fetched that she would call you for help.

Its not even politics. Its litterally a fact that the ocean is filled with plastic.
---
the community cares more about the game, while bethesda only cares about your money
---
Ah aight, i long for it to be released so we can farm it! 
---
Thanks Tharored, this is what I thought, I'm going to hang fire on learning the Elder plan, I'll continue to drop tech data, I assume the Elder Paint will continue to drop.
---
Dammit, this is a great idea!  You're kickass, OP!
---
Besides more tattoos, gun skins (even animated ones) would be nice, power armour paints and outfits are great, but they have to be priced right.
---
Thinking of all the cosmetics in the game, is it really worth it to pay £8 ($8) for a costume? No. It's not. The most I'd pay for an outfit is 100 atoms. Even then it better be amazing. There's no compelling value. Everything is over priced. I estimate the repair kits at 400. That's on the low end. 
---
I've managed to save 650 atoms for free in the game, go to the store and can't get a single power armour paint job. They're all 1000+?! That's a 5th of the game price. For what? A paint job? It's massively over priced. This is the biggest issue with the AS imo. Everything costs too much. 
---
I tracked what I did, heres the results -

No, my technique is much more convenient.  Thanks though....as I currently drink from my plastic water bottle that will most likely end up in a ditch somewhere from me throwing it out the window or just on the ground, even though there is a trashcan within 20ft from me. 
---
Thank you JizzMonster, very cool!
---
This is so completely false. Environmental problems and what to do about them are a political issue in any country where people aren't worried about starving to death. 
---
The nature of that political issue varies from place to place, and people in, say, Germany are having different conversations about what to do about plastic waste than people in the US, but what the problems are and what to do about it is still a political conversation. 
---
We don't think they can only sell cosmetic stuff because it's a paid game, we think they can only sell cosmetic stuff because they outright promised multiple times that's all they would ever sell in it. 
---
The big guy came out and said that the shop would be for cosmetics only, and that there was a line that many other companies have crossed before, but THEY would stay on the right side of it at all times. 
---
Turns out "at all times" ment roughly 3 months. 
---
I am grateful that if anything, this has not happened with Borderlands.  Hell, they give away on their social media accounts.  I buy a season pass on their games, and I get my money's worth.
---
Pay to win? It’s much more like QOL quality of life item not sure how this is gonna hell you win anything in fallout 76 or better yet get the correct perks and repair armour to 200% lol 
---
Are you on XB1?

Except they're going back on their word.  Whether or not you care isn't material, they're breaking their word, and that most certainly is worthy of notice.
---
EXCEPT WHAT IS COST TO BUY IN THE FIRST PLACE.
---
Plus the body is probably aluminum for weight savings (who wants 10lbs of steel strapped to their wrist?!) so it wouldn’t rust.

Its political. Just like fucking everything these days.
---
Vault boy bros. 50 atoms per game. Count me in lol 
---
Really? I regularly run into the case that i want to join my friends game and it places me on a queue because it's full.
---
Wasn't that apart of a few of their models? Far Harbor included. 
---
I think this request would be a good direction for sure
---
functional varied on the game.  if there were bugs, they never got fixed.  if the game sucked, it was never improved.  your interaction with the game world was extremely limited.  modern games have more bugs because they let the player do more.
---
also, consider the marketing push and media coverage back then were almost non-existent.  your release date slipped? who would notice?  whereas now, if a date slips you have a slew of websites picking it apart for weeks, and may even wind up in the ny times or wapo, etc. if it's a AAA game.
---
in short, it's a question as to whether you feel the trade off is worth it.  i'm willing to put up with it because the games are, on the whole, better.
---
Elasticity of demand.  But what MBA is running this shit show?  Do they not understand they're sowing the seeds of their own company tanking?
---
This post makes me happy, I’m a marine biologist and the issue of plastics, micro plastics, any kind of plastic is a big problem right now. So something like this could truly help raise awareness and hopefully help others decide that there needs to be a change.
---
I got into the series with Fallout 3, have since played every single game in the franchise EXCEPT Brotherhood of Steel, which is going to change as I got a copy of it recently. (I’m aware it sucks, I get a special kind of enjoyment from terrible games)
---
Hahaha, dude this cracked me up so bad. This is all relatable. 
---
I believe 8 releases on the 9th
---
Why AA though? You’ve already got tank-killer and perforating magazine, AA at that point is a minimal damage improvement. Hell Mutants probably outperforms it at that point. 
---
Omg at the people taking this post seriously.
---
This is true and I remember when subs were a thing and some people were unhappy, but as time goes on I've learned to appreciate them.  
---
I'd much rather everyone had to pay a $10 a month sub which keeps everyone on the exact same level, ensures there's no cash shop and anyone wearing better cosmetic gear etc. had to EARN it in game. I understand these online games have expenses and if we want content the revenue has to come from somewhere, but I'm sad to see subs a thing of the past while they go after whales etc. instead.  
---
Subs also seem to make the community better as well. I remember Lord of the Rings Online having one of the best ever online communities in a video games, when it was subbed everyone helped each other, talked about the game in detail along with Tolkien's world etc. and it was a great place. As soon as it went free to play the community completely changed for the worse as anyone who had no intention of spending any money poked their nose in, had zero respect or value for the game and just made it worse.  
---
I understand FO76 has no general chat etc. but subs still prevent trolls and if this game goes F2P like some suspect it will I don't want to see the community get worse. 
---
patch 8 is this coming week

CoD, CS, Half Life, Quake, Medal of Honor etc?
---
Oh that's what that is hahaha. Walked around one the other day. Didn't know what it was. 
---
Thanks, Bethesda has discussed actions after patch 8. Thought I missed it.
---
Why are you still here then. Quit the game uninstall or break your disc in half 
---
That would be nice, it would make non-fast traveling fast travel much easier.  If we got vertibirds that would be cool. Companions would also be nice. I remember drawing a few robot companions that needed fusion cores/time connected to a generator and then it would follow you around, similar to in fallout 4.  But yes, mounts/companions would definitely benefit the game.
---
EQ, WoW, DAoC, etc.  FO76 isn’t a FPS.

How many tech data can you hold at once? Is it still 1 at a time or can you do it all at once?

Nah, I am pretty happy actually.  Not miserable.  Thanks for showing concern though.  Nice to know you care.

You get that from eating normal healthy fish, for example, the mahi mahi. It’s an absolutely delicious fish, they breed like rabbits and could be a sustainable fishery. But the problem is they’re a mercury fish, meaning that they naturally (without anthropogenic influence) have mercury inside their bodies and it’s only recommended to have six servings at most a month if you want to eat Mahi Mahi without health concerns.

A suggestion would be to be able to link your account so you can view inventory, discovered locations, quests etc.

They really should make more use of the syringer. RadX barrels for fighting mutated players, radaway and stimpack barrels for assisting people and taking on bloodied players. Any kind of buff or rebuff, really. Even more risk/reward stuff like the karma barrel would be great.

I am so tired of everyone trying to be offended to get their points across.  Like that Overwatch champion person who made the "OK" sign with his hands during an interview and Blizzard gave him a warning not to do that again or he will be banned as it is 'racist'.

We will disagree there.  But everyone is allowed their opinion.

Thank you for being the voice of reason, people freak out so quickly on this subreddit. Remember all those unconfirmed rumors of the trade glitch that made people afraid of trading? This sub is worse than bethesda in creating problems that don't exist sometimes.

The repair kits totally make it pay to win. That is what pay to win means. If you can by pass a game mechanic via buying some thing with real money that is very definition of pay to win.

I wouldn't mind running around and finding vinyl records, and get a collection of music that will be played on my radio and/or the jukebox in my camp.

&gt;I have a feeling most people who have an issue with the atom shop are older gamers and most people who see nothing wrong with the Atom shop are younger gamers

Well I'm in my 50's and see nothing wrong with the atom shop. Those people complaining are just pathetic moaners and wingers who want any excuse to complain about something. They also tend to start new posts trying to make out how important their views, and hence how important they are. If you want something in the shop use your atoms to easily get by playing the game. If you can't afford it, tough shit, get over it. 
---
revelation: most good sci-fi has political commentary
---
My issue with the current system is that gameplay itseld is now tweaked to get people to spend money in the shop. If they kept it to cosmetics, that would be fine. But that's not what most mobile games do. And that approach has now infected mainline games. It's really pernicious http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/RaminShokrizade/20130626/194933/The_Top_F2P_Monetization_Tricks.php

Good to know.  Todd's not the best at explaining things  you see BOS pop up in the coner and assume it was the mod not a paint. Everything's so out of date on the wiki/flextralife/YouTube it's hard to know what's what without Reddit.

Yeah, agreeing with 99,9% of the scientific community and their consensus on a problem that was created by us and can still arguably be reversed through awareness is being a "soy milk drinking fairy". But as long as it doesn't affect you directly and it's profitable who cares right? Even if it's damaging any kind of global long term profitability.  How insecure do you have to be to be convinced that pollution is a partisan issue? You drank all the koolaid obviously.  
---
You do know btw that the chief proponent of the "soy milk contains estrogen" pseudoscience was Paul Joseph Watson, the same guy who also advertised his own nutritional supplement to his viewer base that **CONTAINS SOY?** Do you think a person who thinks soy is a societal problem that "sissifies men" for real would sell supplements to men that contain it?

Kids dont have too, their parents do.

Pollution is not politics...No one benefits from pollution you walnut. The only way protecting the environment is a political issue is when a political party want it to seem like a waste of money or as not true to smear their opponents. So please keep **your** politics to yourself dickhead.

No, see, I’m not playing because the game has consistently gotten bad reviews, because I played ESO, and because Bethesda is continually doing things like this. I wish I were experiencing the new factions, the new lore; I’m a big fan of the series. But the company has proven, again and again, that they don’t care about players.
---
Sorry phone is broken, left app open while sitting down. 
---
one of the other problems they have is that much of the cool stuff (to me, at least) is camp related.  but if your camp budget is maxed and you cannot build them, there is no reason to buy them.
---
i'm assuming all the people complaining that a for-profit business operating in a capitalistic society is trying to maximize profit are young.  or that an initial $60 payment is sufficient to cover regular content updates and years of operational costs.
---
Found the stereotypical "New vegas is the best game in life, fuck all your opinions" fanboy.
---
I took a look there, wasn't the exact thing I was looking for but I appreciate the feedback!
---
Funny enough, when I first started the game, that's where I made one of my first bases
---
Do you know if the same is true with metal armor? I’ve crafted and scrapped hundreds of Metal chests just trying to learn the deep pocketed mod. Oh the screws I’ve wasted. :(
---
I have another idea a hidden nuclear silo, of which the enclave has no information modus can discover its location after a while when we arrived we found hundreds of Chinese robots 
---
I believe it’s true for all the deep pocketed mods.   
---
So, I found a spot west of prickets fort with a great view. South of my camp is the temple, and to the west I can see both the fort and the space station. Thanks for your help!
---
I’m probably gonna turn it into my permanent spot honestly, it would be a nice player vendor spot 
---
I agree! You also made that spot work way better than I did lol
---
Good to know. Thanks 
---
And? You don't have to buy it. You can just skip over it. It's not going to ruin the game. 
---
Why are you bragging about being a parasite to society? Other people have to clean up your mess or you'd be wading around in other peoples messes too. Have some respect and human decency, you are a part of society as much as everyone else. I bet you're the type of guy to complain about all the traffick while sitting in your car in traffick.  
---
Taking such a big personal issue with a problem with such a simple solution (use a reusable container) tells lots of your moral character. Especially now that you are bragging about it too. It's easy to take things for granted until you see the consequences of your actions (but you won't because you expect other people to clean up after you). Typical 50's attitude of "If I throw it where I can't see it it doesn't exist" which lead us to 90% of the pollution and climate issues we have today.  
---
Go back to the 50's where you belong so you can be with your peers who don't understand simple concepts such as pollution.
---
Are the BOS paint names you mention the actual names of the paint in-game?   I have a few different paints from this quest and it's BOS II, BOS IV, I don't recall seeing "Knight" or anything like that on these paints.
---
Iv been waiting to see someone on PS4 with it as well. 
---
Select the quest in your Pip Boy and choose "Show on Map". 
---
I stashed all my previously gathered techdata but haven't done the forbidden knowledge quest yet will all of my 71 tech data transform into one?
---
interesting...
---
Lol I got the idea from a video I saw when trying to look for old buildings I could build in and spruce up 
---
I’ve been waiting for a Vault Jumpsuit since the release
---
Personally I don't feel like basic environmentalism isn't politics, it's just expected of all humans that we respect that. That being said, no one wants hamfisted obvious messages jammed in their face, but I don't feel like mirelurks dropping plastic is even close to being hamfisted. If there was a note going "it's  very important to clean up the environment" it would be different but just mirelurks dropping plastic will go over 90% of the players heads as just "loot". Being offended by the idea that mirelurks should drop plastic is bizarre, it's like the bare minimum of environmental references and people act like the game would require you to register to greenpeace to play.
---
Don't worry about it. At lowish levels it's not that big a deal if you want to just play the game.
---
Well apex is fun for me
---
100s, if not 1000s, of great ideas posted on Reddit from players who actually play and have invested in the game. 
---
Bethesda: "I know what the players want - beverages and repair kits!!!"
---
How about you literally don’t talk
---
Then it could list both
---
Expansions were a thing as early as 1991 - Ultima 7 and it's follow up had expansion packs that added items, locations and quests to the game that arguably could've been cut content. 
---
When in bed and then the pipboy drops over your face because you're getting sleep xD
---
cool idea
---
The fact that you think the *actual* imminent death of billions of people is “politics” makes you a fucking idiot 
---
I felt like the writing was on the wall months ago, but [my post about it was downvoted into oblivion](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a3c5sv/fallout_76_was_designed_to_be_a/).
---
Love the idea. This would allow you to review your progress for each character.
---
It sounds like a really good idea!
---
However, in-universe, seeing as how oil was running out, I imagine there was very little plastic being thrown away rathe than recycled whenever possible.
---
But with how long plastic is anticipated to last in the ocean it certainly isn't lorebreaking either 
---
Pollution is a political and social issue I dont want to think about absolute shite like that while I'm playing my games that's why people need to fuck off virtue signalling and mind their own business.
---
Do that and I will hunt them down into extinction.
---
Yeah that’s one of the major features of the game, being able to re spec your character whenever you want, not sure if you know but once you hit lvl 50 you won’t be able to get any more S.P.E.C.I.A.L points but you can reassign them
---
Okay cheif you and AOC fan then?
---
With the way FO76 is currently setup, you can play the game with one character. Once you hit level 50 you have the option to 1) pick a perk or 2) trade a special point. So say you had (4) points total in endurance and it turns out you do not use endurance. However you need those (3) points in luck for a scrapping perk. You would need to level (6) times to trade the points and level the perk. 
---
(3) levels to trade points of END for LUCK and (3) levels to select and upgrade the perk card.
---
Yes, the same classification field could be used on armor, that would be great!
---
You end up having better time earlier in the game if you dont worry about specific builds, i would lvl 30 is where you start to unlock more build specific perks
---
Yes, but also because more precious plastic...
---
This
---
the pieces of power armor when painted will have those labels of BOS Initiate, BOS, BOS II, BOS III, BOS IV, BOS V, BOS VII.  I believe sentinal was supposed to be VI but wasn't included.
---
I literally can’t imagine being as brainwashed as American “conservatives.” Like, okay, fuck up the entire world for the benefit of a few wealthy people who’s existence actively hurts you.
---
I’d like to buy a raider shielded underarmor. I even have outfit if you need it. 
---
All the OG’s on PC lol 
---
I’m really curious as to why toy cars drop nuclear material. I know real cars in Fallout are nuclear-powered, but why are the toy ones radioactive?
---
Haha!! It’s too bad you don’t see more of this on XBOX and PS4. 
---
As far as my own personal 2 cents go, I turn 40 this year and I've dropped probably a few thousand euros on WoW products, including the games, expansions, subscriptions (for several accounts), race changes, faction changes, realm transfers, mounts, pets and so on over the past 14 years and change.
---
So, that's a full priced game, full priced expansion sets, *and* microtransactions, *and* a subscription, all for the same game. That's a monetization trifecta there, and I've been fine with it. So far, at least.
---
I've also paid subscriptions for other games, and have also bought microtransaction stuff in those games in some cases.
---
So, as just an anecdotal example, I'm one of those "older gamers", and I personally don't have an issue with monetization schemes, whether it's a subscription, microtransactions or something else, even if it's on top of a full priced game.
---
Having said that, I haven't spent any money on Atoms. A big part of the reason why is the selection - I've just not seen enough stuff on there that I would've absolutely loved to have. Another, probably just as big of a part, has been the fact that Atoms are available in the game. From my personal experience, I've not spent money in any game where the currency has been available in the game itself.
---
However, like a lot of others here, I personally can't get behind Bethesda adding non-cosmetic items into the Atomic Store. That would just be them breaking a promise, and a shitty move in general.
---
.....and Arsenic poisoning just as you can with fish &amp; seafood 👍
---
I'm 46 and I don't mind the Atomic Shop.   It's optional.   Atoms can be earned in-game.  The shop can be completely ignored if you want.
---
I understand that it COULD lead to bad things, but I'll save my vitriol for when it does.
---
This is a situation I hoped would never happen. I’ve adored every fallout since release. Plus I’m (was) enjoying 76. This news is upsetting. This is the community that made them what they are. We paid for their content, we paid for their salaries. Now they break promises and go back on their word. I still remember when BGS was an underdog studio. Releasing games that through positive reception and critical acclaim made tell everyone about them and have plenty of watercooler moments discussing what I did or saw on one of their games. Now they’ve point blank lied about adding P2W features into fallout. This is absolutely outrageous. This company made there money on great game development. Bugs and all. We accepted them all and they were the only studio in the world that was constantly getting free passes for glitches. Now they turn on us an milk us for everything we have. I’m actually upset, that this studio I looked up too has become this way. Can’t wait to hear the stories gamers tell about this. “So I needed to repair my weapon as I was in a tight spot, SO I BOUGHT IT”. 
---
CORPORATE GREED. 
---
I’m refusing this point blank.
---
Fallout is literally based on the premise of nuclear war. How do you keep politics out of that? Not to mention the fact that the second Red Scare seemingly never ended in this universe. 
---
Makes more sense then Skyrim's animals that drop gems.
---
In fairness though, it is pretty easy to look past the politics in these games. Then there are games that are like THIS IS OUR POLITICAL VIEWPOINT AND IF YOU DON'T AGREE WITH IT YOU'RE A NAZIIIIIIIIIIIIIII. I get tired of that. Everything is political to some degree, just don't call me a horrible person because I disagree with your particular politics. 
---
I'm not American or conservative just observing  politics on a global scale but thanks for proving my point you fucking NPC.
---
A lot more people would buy atoms if they weren’t overpriced as shit
---
Games today are WAY more complex pieces of software.  It's kind of an unfair comparison.  More complexity = more chances for screwing up.  Even NASA uses buggy code.
---
For the fish to step on?
---
I hope you start getting more attention at home.
---
I played fallout 2 back and picked up fo3 on release, played 4 and NV as well
---
Trim my rune armour for free??? Of course!
---
A lack of politicians. Fla. 👍
---
Kill a mirelurk. Recover 20 lbs of junk.

They really don't.

Look, I realize we won’t all agree with each other on this. That’s pretty much impossible. But deliberately littering to “own the libs”? You’re just an asshat and nothing more. 
---
It’s coming soon. Lots of datamines.
---
I'm stairing at your mistake.

Bruh if you do your challenges that you got laying around you can get almost 500 a night easily.  You have to look for the ones you’re closest to completing.

Upvoted for Bob Dylan lyrics.
---
The pa camo is different, there are (or were) 3 variations.
---
They will probably get new freemium core players. The rest of us our just out 60 bucks.
---
The big difference though is that Fortnite is F2P. Everything you can purchase is and has always been purely cosmetic. It’s just a way to support the developer if you choose to buy these things. They update the game constantly and need to make the money somehow. 
---
Item shops are the future for online games and it’s up to us as the consumers to let these companies know what we will and won’t spend our money on. I think this community did a pretty good job of that over the last 2 days. 
---
I’m 34, btw. 
---
So it doesn't really matter as long as I have the amount of points on each one that I've laid out on nuke?
---
Ok.. I see alot of posts about these threads and none of them mention NEW WALLS for building.
---
You have to complete recruitment blues and then go through the process of obtaining your military ID card.

Well said! Btw I get so sick of seeing folk say “oh but there’s oestrogen in soy” (when it’s actually phytoestrogens) when there’s actually real oestrogen in cows milk, not to mention other pregnancy hormones like prolactin.

Great Post, great research.  I was surprised the Brotherhood scribe outfit was so rare, but checks out, as I have less of them.  
---
Please add location "Watoga high school, 12 file cabinets and one safe."  it became part of my regular source because it's way easier than to get in and get out than sugar grove now that I just casually gather TD

Fallout 1 and 2 code's was supposedly lost, and Bethesda never recieved it from Interplay. They'd have to re-create the first Fallouts from the ground up. 
---
It's really not a 'ten hours' kind of work.
---
Thank you for this guide, its helps a lot!
---
Post-Nuclear wasteland with radiation? Screw that, plastic in the ocean is the real problem!

Don’t bring PAs to PvP. It’s the armor equivalent of bringing a knife to a gunfight.

You’ve got an excellent child!

This isn't a matter of opinion at this point, and that seems to be the issue that you people can't seem to grasp. Pathetic.
---
Agreed! Theres no planet B but the world is full of A$$hats hell bent on its destruction
---
Upvote for sandbags!  Also BOS logos for the green barriers,  and make them snap to the defensive wall/stair combo. 
---
But f76 is a 60 dollar game
---
My poison would be cosmetic only things in the atom store. I’m even fine with them having one day only items to press people into buying. I’m not fine with stuff though they can rebalance the game in a bad way to encourage you to buy them. 
---
Absolutely this! Perhaps someone could tag the community managers? 🤔
---
On nuke? what do you mean
---
Yep it's bizarre, and phytoestrogen has never been 100% proven to metabolise into estrogen in any amount big enough to affect mens hormonal balance even if you do eat soy. But these people don't care about proof, they just want to invent new catchy slurs they can use on their opponents.  
---
it's the same principle as freaking people out by saying dihydrogen monoxide kills tens of thousands of people every year. Yeah that's the chemical form for water, but making it sound chemical makes it seem dangerous. Same with phyto-"estrogen" and "mercury" in vaccines. It has the scary word in so people immediately draw that association despite them being part in a completely different molecule or compound that changes its attributes. Salt is 50% sodium but we don't explode when we put it in our mouth because it's in ion form.  
---
More people should take basic chemistry
---
Which is true stupid thing, because in the fallout universe, you’re supposed to be a walking fucking tank while in PA. But it’s just so weak with the million perks you can choose from and all the anti armor guns.
---
OMFG gimme gimme gimme.
---
They are probably remote control slot cars that need power. 
---
I did not recieve it up to today and I do that quest almost every day.
---
It is kinda rare considering I got duplicates often.
---
There's a big difference between the NES technology and today's technology. Poor comparison but a Tesla will be worth less once as it gets older and demand soars. For its time you are paying a premium for new tech - NES. I think today's costs remaining the same as the past is indicative of today's demand. 
---
I agree with this but I prefer the dlc approach of you spend more to get more game to play. Or if they just go the microtransaction route cosmetic only microtransactions. Consumable microtransactions or ones that give you an advantage are what I’d like to avoid as they encourage bad balancing in games so you pay to fix it. Unfortunately that seems to be the most lucrative way and where the industry is going. Bethesda isn’t the first company to promise cosmetic only only to go back on that later. 
---
Womp womp. Didn’t see it on this sub since everyone’s too busy losing their shot on the repair kits
---
Can you post a picture of what the elder paint looks like?  I cannot find it even with a google search.
---
Absolutely, couldn’t agree more 👍
---
What a dumb fucking idea
---
Exact same thing happened with DCUO when it went free to play....Core players were bombarded with lots of younger, more aggressive ganers and we just drifted away from it....
---
Shame cos that was a great game!
---
Is there anything that actually suggests that?
---
Devs spent 50 millions making video game
---
Devs charge full game and sub for future conntemt
---
Players don't wanna pay and expect years of content
---
Devs remove sub and go b2p
---
Players complain too expensive
---
Devs try to survive with micro transaction
---
Players complain still too expensive, everything must be free after 1 time purchase
---
Devs go bankrupt
---
Players: pikachu face
---
There's a certain point where maybe some people need to start considering that they can't afford gaming as leisure 
---
Not just ranger armour but also classic vault jumpsuits like 13, 101 and 111 on top of that they could add a skin that changes the road leathers into the original style and so many other outfits and redesigns from older games
---
oh wow, two months! it's unthinkable that a human could plan a buisness decision over two whole months! 
---
I hate mtx, but grudgingly tolerate cosmetic ones.  I don't think it should be allowed to sell "chests" or other random items as a large share of the market is children.
---
Sports games where you buy random chances to get better players are Pay To Cheat and absolutely intolerable.
---
Capitalism may have been well suited to the industrial revolution, but, it's getting long in the tooth for the digital age.

Greed and corruption are out of control and wealth inequality is the greatest problem facing humanity (other than the eventual destruction of our home planet when the Sun expands in the distant future)

There are magazines that give poison resist, I have 2 different ones in my inventory, I’m not online atm to have a look to see which ones they are
---
yeah, it's been in there for a while, it's just a teaser, lol
---
Just scrapped. You get paints from events around Cranberry Bog.
---
Fallout 76 is actually Vault 0.  
---
The fun is in dealing with the added challenge of thinking human beings behind the toons you're shooting at. Survival is a different beast than Adventure and needs a different approach. PvP and PvE are also different things.
---
Also, you had a lot of advantages - you were level 50 and stood to lose way fewer caps than he did. You were smart enough to follow the sounds from his loud and crazy explosive gun. Probably the biggest mistake was running in to melee the guy - just because he misses a few shots doesn't mean he'll miss all of them especially given how loud and slow Power Armor is.
---
This is a great idea.
---
1st Fallout game?
---
I was building a few mins ago and it wasnt there, then went back into stairs agai and it appeared, so looks like its coming today probably after the shop updates
---
Raider camp next to pleasant valley station.
---
If someone can complain they will my YouTube feed is just "BETHESDA GOING P2W NO WAY OMG LIES ??????" about that repair kit fiasco so anything that can come out everyone is iust thinking itll be atom shop exclusive 
---
&gt; It seems that the suggestion is that unless we buy unwanted atom shop  items, the servers will go down. If that is the case, then they do not  know what they are doing. 
---
I'm not saying that, I'm just wondering how people would feel about needing to pay for server use like other MMO's models. Obviously it's not a favorable option. I would say it's probably the least favorable option. It's a point about how things could be much worse.
---
&gt; None of us agreed to spend an unlimited amount on top of a $60 game to  subsidize server costs that they needed to be able to cover with the  income from base game sales. 
---
No one is saying **you** have to. The Atom Shop was announced before the game was release though, you knew it would exist and when there's a micro-transaction store, I think it's obvious sales from that are factored into future profits.
---
&gt; There are numerous online games that do not have microtransactions or  subscriptions, and pay for their costs for many years via game and dlc  sales. 
---
They didn't want paid DLC as that can separate the player base, but I guess that's another way to go. How many people, though, do you think would lose their shit if they had to pay for more Fallout 76 every year. It also seems that would be harder to do for 76 than other MMOs since very little of the world is instanced. So the DLC would either need to be off the main map (like the FO3/4/NV single player DLC) or separate servers required. I'm also curious to what MMO you play that has no subscriptions or micro-transactions and how many more examples of them we can find.
---
&gt; I think we're in greed territory rather than covering server costs.   
---
 Profits from microtransactions should be gravy, not necessary for the game's survival...
---
I would say Bethesda is being pressured by Zenimax shareholders to make more money from the Atom Shop and that pressure is going to take precedence over player pressure about the Atom Shop. It's misdirected rage to blame Bethesda or compare it to game companies like Zenimax had no vested interest in. I'd bet 20K caps that the selling point to the head guys was micro-transactions and they were factored into forcasted profits, not gravy to be had *possibly*.
---
Thanks looks like I only have a few more paints to get and the engineers outfit!
---
On the website they dont have that listed for release yet so itd be a surprise if they even randomly dropped them now 
---
I would want this only if they use a text that is virtually unreadable like half of the notes I find left around already. 
---
It wasn't my intention to say that Mailboxes should be an Atomic Shop thing - simply that I wanted mailboxes.  The remark about "100/200 Units of stash" was added by the author of the post.
---
Yeah I still don’t understand why they give you perks that give you more defense than someone in a suit of power armor, pretty much leaves PA a glorified Hazmat suit 
---
Applying a company's past behavior to predict their future behavior is rational.  If person A has always lied about everything, you can use that information to determine if you will trust something that he tells you.
---
At the very least, Bethesda lied about what type of items would be included in the Atom store.  People absolutely should be distrustful of them, and given what they lied about, wary of what is coming in the future.
---
Awesome dude. I’ll be on tonight. Thanks 
---
Explosive weapons are the reason I don’t play PvP
---
A subscription to play a game that people bought for $60...  that would go over well.
---
https://imgur.com/a/xhfMtTs There are some pictures of a fish.

Started with fallout 3 so I'm semi new I'd guess.
---
Fallout is based on a fictional world. Don't shove real life politics into it. Let the fictional world stay fictional. Unless I'm mistaken we never had a nuclear war IRL.
---
Exactly
---
Can do a junkies build lol keep using meds and if you get addicted you’ll do more damage 
---
While this was the intent for Vault 76 everything didn’t go according to plan all the time. The terminal logs in 76 from the Overseer and security team show that the participants of the restoration program were extremely competitive and came at odds frequently. One of the logs even mentions a dude getting a tooth knocked out because someone was jealous he won the shiniest teeth award. It’s possible that upon leaving and seeing the state of things that many of them went rogue because they thought they could do things better.
---
It appears skins for weapons is very difficult for the artists at Bethesda. They have more hair stylists and textile guys on staff than people who can paint on weapon models. 
---
A lot of people seem to forget this. I payed for WoW for 7 years at $15 a month and after being forced to spend money to play a game(Obviously I chose to play in the first place) I'm happy with this new system where I can *choose* to spend money on game. 
---
I probably still spend the same if not more now days in ESO but it feels better since I get to spend it when, where, and if I want to. I also have a huge list of games, FO76 included, where I haven't spent a dime and don't see myself spending any in the future but still continue to enjoy them anyway.
---
My problem: I'm sitting on 5k Atoms and haven't found anything which I really want to buy. 
---
Personally I would like to see more stuff to personalize armor/weapons and my camp.
---
**Camp:**
---
The existing ingame camp items are not bad, should be enough variety for someone who doesn't want to buy additional stuff. 
---
I think it's easy for Bethesda to add 10 different TV models, 20 couches + 20 couch skins etc. for the atom shop. No one would care if those items were atom shop only.
---
Important objects which are linked to game mechanics (Planned: Player vending machines or refrigerators) should be attainable for all players without spending real money.
---
Raider, Mutant themed bundles for a fair price would be also nice. Each item individually attainable ingame as an rare event reward or they can be bought in the shop.
---
**Pricing and Strategy:**
---
They should lower the atom shop prices drastically. Common, boring outfits are not worth $5-$10. 100-200 atoms are enough.
---
"Clean outfits" could be rare ingame and their plan could be bought in the shop. Learning by scrapping 1% chance. Or it for 200 atoms.
---
Same for "dirty outfits", common, plan can be bought in the shop, 5% chance for learning by scrapping. Or buy it for 100 atoms.
---
Shop only items like skins, 256 different colors to personalize armors/weapons, tons of additional camp objects. Color 50 atoms, skins 100-500 atoms, camp stuff 10-500 atoms. Bundles 500-2000 atoms.
---
Additional Hair/beards/piercings/tattoos for character creation, 50-200 atoms.
---
High quality outfits could be the most expensive shop items, price 1000 atoms max. Ranger armor wouldn't be lore friendly, but its iconic for fallout. Add it to the game. Multiple Great Khans and Caesar's Legion outfits? Why not. I would also support better Raider, Leather and BOS outfits. High end, highly detailed variants. Ingame patchwork armor doesn't look very good. ;)
---
Ingame atom gain with events/achievements seems fine, grindy but with adapted prices it would be OK.
---
**NO-GO:**
---
Hello Kitty stuff and other cancer.
---
Nerfing game mechanics an release P2W stuff in the shop. Weapons break faster - buy repair kits, food spoils faster - buy a refrigerator, scrap gets much heavier - buy the mobile stash access.
---
\-
---
If they continue this practice combined with the lies = FO76 could have been my last Bethesda game.
---
There are more than enough ways to make money. I am ready to buy atoms if they quit this mental electronic arts disorder and become Bethesda again.
---
&gt;Bethesda has created so many countless hours of fun for us. In no way at all will an atom shop repair kit tarnish their name or effect my gameplay or enjoyment. People have got to chill out about this kind stuff. You ethically object over a repair kit? Simple, don’t buy it. The atom shop is there to fund DLC and there’s a year of DLC planned.
---
You're forgetting that Bethesda didn't create those countless hours of fun for you out of good heart - but to sell the game. They received their payment.
---
The other part, let me put this straight - you're thinking about buying a car. You're doing your research and turns out there's the additional Car Shop where you can buy cosmetics for your car. You decide to buy the car. You're having fun with the car, but suddenly it turns out that the Car Shop is not only cosmetics. If you're not unhappy with that, well, that's fine, but people have right to be unhappy about it. Also, once the car company decides it's time to sell new, powerful engines through the Car Shop - guess what, it's thanks to you. I mean, after all, you took your chill pill so you're fine with it and obviously a corporation will see that it can get away with more. And if you're unhappy with new, powerful engines to buy in the Car Shop to lessen the grind, there's always someone who'll tell to you just don't buy it and to chill out. 
---
If I can get hundreds of hours out of a game its not so bad to sped some money here and there. Ive spent $80 on games before and never even played more than 60hrs and its over, thats when I get truly disappointed. 
---
I'm my experience,  if you get the tech data that's not flagged as a quest item from a friend/alt you'll need to drop pick it back up and it'll get the flag. 
---
Oooorrr, they could just download it from steam.... and copy.... "supposedly lost" you can still buy the thing. They don't need to change anything.
---
Yes and that long history example would be....?
---
 I have 300 hours in the game.   I started with Fallout NV, then played Fallout 4 and went back to Fallout 3 before this one came out.  This is my  favorite video game series, and I even dressed up as the lone wanderer for Halloween one year...   
---
I’m going on 34, played video games my whole life, and I see nothing wrong with the atom shop. This isn’t a game you can play offline. This is a game that will have future add ons, etc. The server needs to be paid for somehow though, and   Atom Shop May be the way they do it.
---
&gt;you fucking NPC
---
🤔 
---
But that's fear of what might happen not looking at what is being offered here. So all of that is similar presumption.  
---
This game was a diversion from their usual fixed world environment where DLC was the option, instead trying a non-subscription, non-dlc approach. 
---
So again, my statement is that AS IS and As STATED I don't see a problem with Repair kits but yes of course of they made repairs unrealistically hard comparatively that made these more of a necessity than a novelty or luxury than of course I'd have an issue. 
---
My problem is with the slippery slope argument because it's making people needlessly draw arbitrary lines and plug their ears to conversation and won't even discuss rationally. 
---
Yes. Martial Artist also works. 
---
"Half your hits do no damage" is something on your end.  I don't have any such problem.
---
This is the stupiest thing i heared. From the pure stats, my PA is better than my normal armor. PvE also proofs this. When you mean a specifc rare armor is better, than this might be true, but still stupid. 
---

But... there *are* real politics in it. A lot of things in Fallout can be labeled as satirization of McCarthyism, which was a real life phenomenon. By satirizing McCarthyism, it’s sending a very obvious message that McCarthyism is stupid. 
---
Even though Fallout is fictional, the political messages it sends due to the very nature of its content are numerous. You can’t get around it. Art will almost always be attempting to say *something*, and video games are no exception. 
---
learned one from scrapping a combat armour peace (non BOS) a few days ago.
---
Yes they are going to sell legendary tokens.  Also I heard that they plan to introduce robot workstations for the winter event to the atom shop so you can  build companion robots.  
---
Honestly, I want Bethesda to fix the replacement issues with foundations.  Relax whatever bizarre restrictions they have in place that prevent CAMPs like yours from being replaced.  If the system exists to force players to build plausible CAMPs, it is completely undermined by making us build floating CAMPs to get around it.
---
Since Asia is the primary source of plastic waste in the seas, it makes absolutely no sense for mirelurks to carry plastic in landlocked West Virginia.
---
Like a PVP Roofie lmao
---
It looks the same as the Paladin paint, but it [has this emblem on the arm](https://i.imgur.com/qke7Fdd.png).
---
Exactly what I think. They don't seem to be catering for fallout fans which confused me as to why the game was made?
---
The first rule of fight club is you don’t talk about fight club?
---
My thoughts exactly,  I like this pay structure.  If i want to throw a few bucks at the game i will, otherwise it's free. I would, however, go as far as to want xp boosts. (I don't value cosmetics at all, but i understand why people buy them)
---
Xp/levels are pretty useless as it is after 50. Serving to only patch your character if you made a mistake building. As i get older i find that i can only throw maybe an hour or two a week into the game. Something to "catch up" to the rest, or in the event that you made a build that you're not happy with it would let you grind quicker to fix.
---
I like this repair kit plan even better. Though, i hope that if they do it, they will put it as something that can be found or bought in game. For people who don't want to pay.
---
Then high level weapons/armor don't belong in there. Obtaining them is essentially the end game goal.
---
Tldr; there has to be a line as to what should be sold. I just dont think it should be cosmetics only. 
---
Go watch 2 minutes of their recent panel: https://youtu.be/-zIQaXj8h6o?t=1268
---
They explain that they are thinking of modes that would require starting a new character, and the main reason for making characters transferable between survival and adventure mode during the beta was that it makes it a *lot* easier to find balancing issues rather than having to wait months for people to level up.
---
I'm not saying they are doing things perfectly at the moment, let alone in the past, but let's not give them an F when they deserve a C. There's room for nuance in the world.
---
There's that...
---
And also clearing out / defending Mount Blair can be a very tedious process given how enormous and maze-like the area is.
---
Oh, yeah as long as you have enough points 
---
Mass downvote this clown and move on, pathetic
---
That i run into him, was only due that he wasn't that far away and i had my sword equiped. Due to PvE, i prefer melee weapons and only switch to guns if the enemys are further away or there are too many and i need to get a distance to them. Sure i was aware that this might get me into a disatvantage, because i have limited range and the firerate is lower. Melee weapons have higher base damage. 
---
Wow :o
---
That was the Find the Commie test right? Before my group got to the building as soon as I read "Patriot Test" or whatever it says, I was like "I bet we have to weed out the communists."
---
Nah this was real.
---
Because if people want anything from their games, it’s the opportunity to be exposed to various campaigns.
---
Perhaps they could remove all the enemies from the game to raise awareness about violence against animals?
---
Orange man bad.
---
Need plastic in Fallout?  Just throw some stuff into the real ocean.
---
Yep that's exactly it. You had to find the "communist sympathiser", turns out it's little Jimmy whose father gets sick after working in the mine and is in the union. Can't let those workers organize or they'll demand to be treated as humans!
---
What makes these stairs better?
---
Do you have mods installed? I would reinstall the game. I don't think these are normal bugs and my have something to do with your set up. 
---
Well said bro 👊
---
Why is your 8 year old playing Fallout?
---
Two key words in that satirization and fictional. Keep it at that. The politics in fallout is based on the fictional world. Not one real life. Once you bring in real life you ruin the game. People play video games to get away from real life. Not to get slapped in the face with another reminder of real life.
---
What games are like that? Not trying to be prickly I'm genuinely curious.
---
Having been a fan since Fallout 2 was first released I can relate to where you're coming from. I can also see the need for ongoing maintenance costs to keep online games up and running. Both of those perspectives in consideration, I just really wish companies could find a way to generate that needed continuing revenue that didn't feel so predatory. The industry is so addicted to forcing players into gambling when they buy anything these days. It's sad.
---
Me: Files these replies under, "the left can't meme."
---
Is there that the one from Roses quest line?
---
Only since 4 but it’ll be forever now. 
---
Maybe I have not done her quests
---
Gives you gas
---
Exactly 
---
Im on xbox too!! Feel free to message me ur tag and i will also happily come stand by and protect your daughters lovely camp :) im lvl 127, so wont do much against level like 300 and somethings, but i totally agree with this post, i have never gone on fallout 76 with pvp in mind, i just love exploring and building!! :) 
---
The number of people buffs her stats, and if they are low-levels who contribute nothing to the battle, they are leeches.
---
There's kind of a flow to these battles where if you do enough damage in the first 5 minutes or so, players are more likely to see that you're serious about killing the SBQ and get with the program.  Part of that is using the Cryolator to freeze her on the ground, making it easy for others to get in and attack.  If you reach the 10-15 minute mark and still haven't triggered the health reset, skepticism sets in.  I've seen fights like that turn around drastically in the last few minutes, but it requires a bit of luck that her AI gets screwed up and keeps her grounded and doing nothing for several minutes.
---
That’s how online games used to be 
---
How much you want for it?
---
Has a different kind of side railing by the looks of it
---
I cant stop laughing... the pic looks like a pregnant clown😂😂😂
---
Yeah.  As a 60 year old I think youngsters like you should learn to chill.  Definitely a generational thing. 
---
It's not just generational. By that I mean old school gamers vs the new generation. I think it's probably just an age issue. Kids don't quite get DLC stores. We've all seen stories about a 7-9 year old accidentally charging up over $1000 worth of purchases on a phone game. When asked they seem to not quite realize that they're spending real money. 
---
Part of that is probably that young children don't grasp abstract concepts. As the brain develops, it can handle more and more complex concepts and the whole abstract thing "this is not real money but it's worth real money so what you do has consequences" becomes 2nd nature. One interesting experiment is running the old "a man steals medicine to save his family" or "a man steals a loaf of bread to feed his family" question. Younger kids see the world in harsher, black or white, ways while older kids start seeing the greys.   
---
Give your son a few years. When he's in his teens, he'll probably consider microtransactions like that to be scummy as well. 
---
Wow you’re so clearly *not* an American conservative, because I can see that you definitely don’t automatically assume I’m critiquing a specific American politician by calling out your shirt rhetoric
---
Damnit! First the Chinese nuke America, descending the world into armageddon. Now they’re polluting the waterways with trash and killing the Mirelurks?! Fucking communists...
---
For those that missed
---
It was why dlc was  so exciting. Imma def throw some money at hours and hours of new amazing content.
---
It stays until killed 
---
I know im just tired of doing it over and over.
---
I've actually enjoyed my time with F76 (despite obvious issues) and have had few issues with the Atomic Shop (mostly) but this really feels like a massive betrayal that will lead to so much worse for the game. 
---
If this nonsense gets put into the game FOR ATOMS when it should be an in-game item to be crafted, costing only in-game resources, I'm done. Fuck that, fuck Fridges or Ammo Converters in Atomic Shop, fuck pay to win and paying for "timer savers" or simple conveniences that should be free content as advertised and promised. "We know where the line" is my ass. Bethesda ya'll need to get your shit together, put it in a bag, then go ahead and shove that bag right back up your ass. 
---
You were getting so close to Fallout 76 being on a positive track and slowly turning around the majority view that the game is a buggy dead mess not worth playing. Now this? Two steps forward, fifty ragdolls back.... I really like being able to play 76 with my partner, with my friends or even my younger cousins, there's a lot of fun that can be had with people or by yourself. I was feeling quite good about where the game was heading over the next year with all the new content coming, not anymore. I've defended Fallout 76 on a few occasions, but I really can't defend this bullshit.
---
(Sorry to anyone who isn't Bethesda for my ranting and raving/if this doesn't count as a relevant ramble for this post, I'm new to Reddit \*cowers and braces for impact\* and just made this account to angry rant about this BS, so I don't quite know all the rules just yet. Thumbs Up!, Thumbs Up!, Heart!, Shooty Guns! ...)
---
I will do that. Thank you.
---
You're ignoring the fact the repair kits create monetary incentive for Bethesda to do things to push selling them. And the things they could do to push selling them is to rebalance the game to make them more essential. I'd rather not there be any monetary incentive for them to rebalance the game badly cause chances are, they will go for it. This has shown time and time again. GTA online didn't start out too bad. The stuff R* did to incentivize shark card purchases, subtle enough I had plenty of the same arguments you are giving me right now about how they weren't a problem. Look at the reputation it has now. Hell... at first Rockstar promised single player DLC for GTA. By a year later they were saying that they were too focused online (and the money it was making) to put that out. 
---
I'd rather stop this now before it gets to the point it is obvious they have changed the game to sell them because by that time, it is too late, they already are making a ton of money and good fucking luck getting them to change. I'd rather not them put anything that gives them monetary incentive to change the game. Cause, well, they are here to make money. I don't begrudge them that but I  want them to be incentivized in ways that improve the game for me, not make it worse.
---
&gt; a Tesla will be worth less once as it gets older and demand soars.
---
You need to relearn some basic economic principles -- soaring demand does not cause prices to fall.
---
Awesome. Thankyou.
---
Omg maybe this is the system because I’m also on PS4 &amp; this is literally the one thing I complain abt daily lol. I HATE IT. like i buy a cute new icon and have to change it anytime i server hop, get disconnected, whatever. Ugh.
---
For me, it’ll show me my newly purchased icon in the social menu above friends/team/recent. But then when I join a team, it’s the default vault boy icon. I’ve started noticing lately though that above friends/team/recent, it’ll show the same default icon. 
---
Hey all. I was just asking a genuine question..no need to target each other over it. Preface to the rest - this isn’t a sh***post in anyway it’s all genuine if a bit cliche...But we are all gamers and probably all Bethesda fans to some extent in that we are combing through a subreddit based on one of their games. What’s the point in getting mad at anyone and wasting your energy on it when they are sitting behind a screen who knows where. Is it really worth your time and emotional investment (to whatever extent..) and isn’t it much more enjoyable to send some love then hate... let’s all celebrate one another because we are here talking about games and because we all appreciate them and care as much as we do to spend time on reddit reading, discussing, and learning and sharing knowledge on them... Read, breath, and reply..love you all - gaming is one of the best industries in the world! 
---
I know no one would like it,but I think survival shouldn't have legendaries at all. At least that way it's fair and based on skill, not the random rolls you happened to get that other people may never get.
---
no ider, but it's been in there for weeks...
---
I want the 3 new skins for the handmade in the shop :D (and the stair),
---
but i dont think we will see any great stuff before the new patch, only "sales" stuff and a few not so interesting new items, lol
---
This is a big thing to..can’t really monetize a freezer can you?
---
&gt; Once this post is ~24 hours old, we will default to our "standard" system:
---
Pretending to be transparent while basically just delaying censorship by 24 hours. You should really start working at Bethesda with your talent to spin things.
---
Most decent weapons are lvl25+ anyway, so at low levels you should just experiment instead of grinding towards one build.
---
All you have to do is not pay. Other than the purchase of the game and dlc I have never spent any other real money on any game. I really don't see the big deal as long as you are able to grind for the items in game. If others want to spend extra money, rather than time, for the items more power to them. Personally I like the grind, others don't, and I refuse to dictate how they play a game they paid for.
---
Thank you. Great reply!
---
Since you appear to be much more involved do you by any chance know the most popular way fans requested them to be implemented? I would IMAGING as loot added to the world
---
I hadn't realized that her stats were sliding scale. I'll be more aware of my lobbies. 
---
https://youtu.be/JXPffO8_jEU
---
It'd be god damn hilarious but abused a ton
---
By being able to bypass the grind for materials to repair your gear you can level faster and thus find better guns &amp; gear. 
---
Anything that makes your experience easier is objectively an advantage and usually called pay2win. 
---
Your naive or ignorant attempt to interpret the word "win" in a literal way is just a deflection tactic as there's never been a game in this world that says "insert coin to win". 
---
i'll come to you for adrenal reaction, bird bones, eagle eyes, marsupial and scaly skin in few min, just the time to check all materials
---
Give us Skyrim horses since they can climb anything
---
Sounds good. I can cover any you are short. 
---
Same here with the death tambo. I've got a 90% reduced weight, anti-armor, faster swing speed death tambo and it's a considered an unarmed weapon, not a one-handed melee weapon.
---
Except the entire game can be played without ever being in FPS mode. So calling it a FPS isn't right but it is also not wrong. It's a RPG with shooter elements similar to something like Deus Ex. 
---
Also many of those MMOs get shut down due to lack of support and polish. Just what you see now are those that survived the vast graveyard of MMO deaths.
---
Source: Lived Through It.
---
Damn batman still does this stuff?? that's amazing!! glad to see others doing this aswell.
---
Would be great no need for the middle man when exchanging supplies
---
Or go to your base climb a high point and jump spawn and camp and grab your stuff again , just one loading screen 
---
My experience is easy because i know how to get mats easily.  I have never had an issue repairing anything.   I have multiple high level accounts and did it all without your "p2w" repair kirs.
---
I will add my name to the list. IGN wheeldogz, will repair weapons to 200 percent on PC 
---
Yes, we should. However they did put the toilet paper the correct direction this time.
---
I wish that were the case or even just the recipe available in the Atomic Shop for free but they did already say that they would be individual one time use items available for Atoms in the Atomic Shop. Not a recipe.
---
This. They even have glass Nuka-Cola and milk bottles, and water (not the purified survival water) comes in a carton like some milk and juice containers in our world.
---
Refugees welcome
---
ign Lethe\_kratos added you
---
That is a great example of dlc done right, Witcher 3 all together.  But too often there's disparity or contention.  The product that's preordered, reviewed, and hitting the shelf being three different things is more the aim of my comment.  Some examples would be the whole saga of No Man's Sky, or the PS3 issues for Skyrim's Dawnguard dlc.  Phase one of those games featured one product for one price.  In two different ways, those games varied drastically from their prima facie. 
---
Too complicated
---
I have hotkeys but to my knowledge it only uses the ten numerals. That limits it to weapons, alcohol, radaway and stimpack for me. Rad-x means pipboy. There's more than ten things I would like to be able to do/use.
---
Besides... hotkeys don't work while sitting down either.
---
I would appreciate different markers if someone can log which kind these all are :)
---
Trying to find an animal friend
---
He doesn’t post about it as often as he use to, but he’s still around. 
---
Woah. We're all fallout lovers here. No need to bash him for his opinion. He's allowed to think NV was the best. 
---
It is more like those MMOs than it is the FPSs. The big difference is in those games like cod, halo, whatever, or even in these new battle royales, you play individual matches. Match starts, and everyone is on a more or less even footing (as far as things like gear/loadout go), then the match goes on until a set condition or time limit is met, then the match is over, and a new one starts. As opposed to how most MMOs work, where the world is there, and people log in, and go do their own thing, solo, or in a party, and log out. Their gear, progress, etc., all persist from one session to the next.
---
At least this isn't pay to win
---
Sadly I think this would be wasted by people earraping, playing unlorefriendly stuff, or just yelling slurs
---
Where TF did you hear a dumb thing like this?
---
That's fair enough, glad to hear one of the OG's of this are still around. Glad to see more people inspired.
---
That's irrelevant as your experience would be even easier by just buying the repair kits.
---
That's exactly what they're doing. The Better Version that actually gives you a boost is drop only, plus keeping atoms plentiful that you get for free just completing daily quests makes it easy to even "buy" these without spending a dollar. 
---
What’s on Gatling 
---
How does saving less than 60 seconds make my game easier?
---
does the bounty transfer between survival and adventure?
---
As of right now, I don't think so.
---
Back before CoD was egregiously monetized the game ran on listen servers so the upkeep cost was lower than what Beth would be paying for 76.
---
I don't know but i know i never got any.
---
Right, you do a whole round in camp McKlintock and the likes in less than 60 seconds. 
---
Go troll someone else please.
---
How much u will pay for paddle ball?
---
Git gud
---
Why do i need to do a round in mclintock?
---
Bloodied
---
Fast travel to me. My stupid chat isn’t working for some reason. 
---
I said go troll someone else. I have no time for you playing stupid.
---
Sorry i dont know the answer 
---
They will be on the other adventure or survival map with the bounty e.g. 200 caps. When they die they will lose 0 caps. So they can easily remove your bounty in adventure mode and the go back to survival
---
Do you have one? Give me a good price and I'll probably accept it.
---
You should be able to sell your Atoms for caps too. Free market!
---
I really want more raider stuff also. I was just thinking about how we need more uses for bone in our camp? Like walls made from wood and bone that have skulls on pikes around it like a raider camp. I also think it would be great if there were raider armor skins in the ATOM shop for leather/combat/x-O1 and camp items, have them look like raider modified versions of what they are (skulls/spikes/sawblades added on). 
---
A higher luck level must play into the paint drops, I've submitted about 50 technical data and haven't had a single paint drop. I have a luck of 6.
---
9k I dont see any ever
---
New Vegas things like NCR armor before they even existed
---
Do you not see the problem with that? And why would they be all the out here on the west coast?
---
Right? So I'm just supposed to sit on the bench and watch the other player finish with the vendor and NOT fiddle with my pipboy? Total lack of realism.
---
Kinda want to get a sloth, cat or attack dog. Had a deathclaw but he got scorched so had to lure stuff to kill him.
---
RIP Bethesda.
---
I cant think of a game studio that deserves to collapse more than yours.
---
Yes. You need to make load at a weapons workbench and then scrap a load until you get the mod learnt.
---
If I'm not worth your time why do you keep arguing?
---
You obviously do not like the game.  Stop complaining about it and go play something else.  I want bethesda to find ways to make money.  I want them to be able to pay for their servers to keep running.  
---
Life is not free.  You dont deserve for your game to be easy just because you want it to.
---
You can make atoms in game if you chose to.  You can use those atoms to buy the repair kits.
---
No that's a different mod
---
If only FO76 had player-hosted servers. Then, BGS wouldn't have to keep servers running (except a master server). Oh, but there would be no Atomic Shop.
---
Fact: It's actually classified as an "Action Role-Playing Game".
---
Oh ok
---
Again
---
If that happens leave the server and join back again you pet will have reset
---
That sucks
---
thank you, and your camp is very beautiful :D
---
Preggo clown beating some heads in with a pipe. Hell yeah.
---
Some do, most are account wide. I'm at the point of having finished nearly every challenge available in game and they're running out, very few new challenges have been added and the pretty much only way to earn atoms at this point is the dailies and weeklies with offer about 50 atoms per day in dailies and about 100 atoms in weeklies. 1350 Atoms average per week if you play everyday of the week and complete all challenges for each day that week, which can be very time consuming. For people who have stuck with the game and played it a lot there's really not a great rate of gain in atoms, even if they "only" cost 50 atoms each that's really not cheap and lets be real that is pretty much the cheapest they'll sell them to us for except maybe MEGA PACKS that have like 100 or 150 repair kits and 25 BONUS IMPROVED REPAIR KITS! And sure maybe Improved Repair Kits won't start on the store but if this the way Bethesda is gonna go they will be eventually... I say all this as person who has enjoyed Fallout 76 and even dropped some real world cash on some stuff from the Atomic Shop, cosmetic items for my camp and a couple of goofy outfits is one thing but I won't pay for Time Saver bullshit that should be a normal game feature.
---
- It is perfectly viable to gather more resources than one will ever need without ever touching a workshop.
---
Not gonna disagree with you, especially since I have a junk extractor at my camp, however going through MB a few times, even at level 14 with my level 30 friend makes me wonder why nobody else uses it as a secondary source. 
---
- Workshops are an open invitiation to PvP *anywhere on the map and without warning.*
---
Maybe my lobbies are just empty, but I've had 2-3 experiences of PvP through a workshop since release. Is it much more common for other people?
---
No for now wood armor is bugged and drop only 1 star
---
Good to know so I don’t waste my caps anymore lol
---
They are on PC, I've not heard of yours.
---
Thanks!! I just crashed to desktop. Hopefully that’ll fix my chat. Was there anything else you needed? 
---
hopped 3 servers, same 3 players including me. Asias servers are dead af.
---
LOL!
---
I just want a skin for my combat shotgun!
---
When they openly (and without notice behind the scene) start changing game mechanics to promote generating more revenue for themselves, it pisses allot of people off obviously.   In my opinion they are starting to ramp up on desperation, and just trying to make something out of their major blunder of a game.  The game bombed on release and gained such a negative stigma that they probably are at the point (due to management) of taking risks and going back on their word to attempt to squeeze more money out of this joke of a release, even if it pushes more players away, it is a risk they are obviously willing to take at this point.  More me the fact that no one from "support" seems to comment on all these things degrading faster with no change logs noting these changes, indicates they know.
---
Oh he was still scorched after. Not a big deal tbh, just gotta find another xD
---
Oof 
---
It's gone now :'(
---
Exactly fucking this.
---
Once it's in the shop, the entire game will be balanced to push it.
---
played all the number games (was too young when I was playing 1 and 2 didn't have the attention span for it, but i beat 3 and four entirely, (beat 3 multiple times over)) Played new vegas… a lot, beat it multiple times over.
---
Still enjoying 76. dont care too much about the atom shop, but if theres something cool in there i'll occasionally grind points for it. or use PSN card... never gonna drop my own cash on it though.
---
Environmental awareness is not politics though
---
no ty, serums was all i needed
---
Ye oof for sure xD
---
So in the completely nuked future we must worry about plastic?
---
No.
---
It would be silly. 
---
They will, you need to get them transferred to an alt account prior to doing that quest. 
---
 Multiple ways to do this, but remember if you are going to use a friend, make sure that they have not done the quest yet, or they'll be gone forever. 
---
&gt; Stop complaining about it and go play something else.
---
I will do whatever I please, thank you very much. 
---
&gt; I want bethesda to find ways to make money.
---
Why don't you ask Bethesda if you could pay them to go down on them instead of doing it for free?
---
Hold up, you can unlock BOS Elder paint?
---
Well, time to go grind Technical Data then!
---
Yeah, this is a real problem. I'm surprised there hasn't been a fix yet. Must be more broken than we realize.
---
This will totally fuck up player vending if they can't get it working. We NEED to be able to see those effects. 
---
And while they're at it. Give us a way to do the same thing in the player trade menus.
---
I live in SW Pennsylvania. So this is good enough for me. Morgantown is like a 30 minute drive. Lol.
---
I would however lose my shit if they ever had an expansion involving a better version of The Pitt than the garbage dlc in 3.
---
Can a wastelander get an eyepatch?
---
I don't see any either but I don't think 50 tokens are worth 9k. I'll pass.
---
It's one of the worst mechanics in the game TBH. I've had to do the same thing for the mods on my lever and handmade rifles. It wastes loads of junk but it's the best way to get them. You can get the scrapper perk under intelligence to get more back after scrapping.
---
It’s funny that you try to be some sort of hero with this post but you can’t even do it without using derogatory terms. It’s not pay to win but it’s not cosmetic either. Tbh you seem more mad than anyone I see posting against the move. 
---
What would you offer?

Great guide, lots of work to put this together. Thanks! My PC drop rate experience is a bit different though. Anything other than aid and ammo are rare. Guess the RNG rolls have been unfavorable for me. The BOS Shielded Underarmor plan was a recent drop though. I'm still hunting for the BOS Combat Arms material plan. I have Chest and Legs but Arms are AWOL. 
---
I want paint and skins for everything. Take my atoms!!!
---
Indiana Beach. Lmao
---
i miss the subscription model. Pay your fee and get EVERYTHING. When i see someone with a cool hat, i knew he played for it and did something cool, and i wanted to achieve this too. 
---
These days i see someone with something cool and think "meh, he just bought it, nothing special".
---
whered you find him?
---
Imagine if they fixed it so the queen were finally affected.
---
Nukashine her and she ends up at the mag hatters tea party.
---
Tritium-infused glow paint, is probably the idea.
---
What matters is not the repair kits themselves, but a fact, that bethesda can get away with breaking their promise of atomic shop items being cosmetic only.
---
Random spawn next to big b's reststop 
---
There are also waaaaaay more customers. You create the software once and cann sell it as often as you want. Back in the days, gaming was a niche thing. Now you have millions of customers buying your games.
---
I found one maybe a month ago, what system are you?
---
I love this idea
---
Thanks Banshee, edited accordingly. 
---
Resources are resources. I dunno about you but I horde resources.
---
Pre haps Bethesda's causing this commotion so they can sneak things into the game like a tnt done key I know its pretty far fetched but I hope it's right for the game and Bethesda's sake 
---
Been there for a month at least, the way you can find these (and others) is going into build mode, and just going through looking to find variants. You might have to click “toggle buildable objects” on/off. Some items have been seen this way like the “vault tec patio table” before its release.
---
Basically, if an item shares a tab with an already existing item, depending on however they code it in, it can show up before its release. 
---
I really want those too, it looks so much nicer with the railings.
---
I’ve been getting everything from beer bottles to toys from those gulpers, so yeah the environment is a mass 😫
---
I don't know why you were down voted because as programmers, putting buggy code out is pretty crappy.   It seems, whether true or not, that they don't care or accept the bug.
---
You could argue that wolfenstien 2 hamfisted left leaning politics and insulted right leaning people, but I really don’t care about the argument. Wolfenstien 2 was kinda a bad game overall.
---
More of a movie than a game.
---
I'll add once I've painted it. 
---
That was my thought, being able to repair your weapons on the go or even mid-fight in survival really could mean the difference between winning and losing. 
---
For real? 
---
They just need to change the key for Sit / Rest / drink to something other than the key used for picking something up
---
Fucking rip... I found it in WhiteSprings clubhouse
---
Well, your wish is half granted.
---
Yeah man, I thought it was rare since nobody talks about it but wasn't sure
---
4-6 months. It has only been 5. Wait until it hits 6 months and you can complain.
---
 mayor for a day    
---
damn robots 
---
(shhhh, he doesn't know. don't tell him)
---
Yeah good idea
---
Interesting, got to admit once I found out that having the dropper logging off and back in worked I stopped looking for other methods.
---
I did try dropping and picking back though, did not work for me. 
---
It seems like the person that typed this up has some issues and more than likely needs to be on some medication.  
---
I agree with most of your points. 
---
I know, that's what I end up doing. But here was an opportunity to do it ahead of time so I wouldn't have to scrounge for them and I couldn't do it because of the STUPID spoiling mechanic WHICH I HATE.
---
awesome 
---
You sure it wasn’t a green hood or something? Got a pic of it?
---
Probably as an event prize like protect the plant
---
I think the major complaint these days is Bethesda has made a horrible money grab and is trying to censor criticism of it
---
Ah shit, you're right it's a green hood lol I just woke up
---
Time to dump all my plastic in the ocean to help out future vault dwellers.
---
Fallout has ALWAYS, since the first game in 1997, been political. It’s a satire on American politics. And what I love is that it doesn’t take sides. It makes fun of both the right and left, no one is left out, no one gets angry.
---
They still are just cosmetics, they don't offer any stats or abilities. It would be different if they prevented you from being vats or didn't appear on radar but you do, so it's not the same.
---
Looking at recent posts, people are regularly selling tokens for 25 caps per. 50 would be 1250c, and I seen someone sell ~40 for 2000c yesterday. I'd pay 2500c max for either 50 tokens or the Paddle.
---
Have two bloodied crossbows, 1* lvl 45 and 2* with limb damage lvl 35

The damage system for PvP is completely different from PvE. I've not seen much detail but I think essentially you can ignore the damage dealt and damage resistance numbers. It's all done by percentages in PvP. Your gun will do x% damage to your enemy per hit. Then you have to factor in perks like lone wanderer, serendipity and arnor like sentinel, assassins and cavalier. The PvP professionals have all figured out the system and how to kill efficiently within it and understandably they aren't sharing how 😀
---
If you are in PA and you see a group not in PA I would suggest running. They know what they are doing.

Fallout 76 is political satire of the ever growing automation we are seeing replacing jobs, and the way they might have handled things in WV, which is exactly like they handled it in the 1930's, striking miners vs strikebreakers
---
That's just it, they CAN afford it. They just have to let others pay for it. But they refuse to.
---
Especially the power armors, even though the ‘knowledge tip’ says those were common sights before the war, there’s very few military skins for them only until recently. Instead there’s ‘play time’, ‘hot rod’, and vault tek blue and yellow garbage. Wth were they thinking? The dumber the merrier? 
---
25* years old at the time of 76.
---
Alright alright alright!
---
I have everything for Adrenal, Carnivore, and speed demon. 
---
Unfortunately I am out of crimson flux but will get back to you when I get some. Then I can get eagle eyes and marsupial.
---
I'm a little older than you and see the shop very different. To me it is a reward system for frequent players - drank your liquor all week? well trade in those points for a spiffy new hat to show others that you waste too much time here!
---
Then again, I grew up paying $5 for a half-hour of credits to connect to a BBS and watch an "@" symbol move around the screen and kill letters.
---
Wait sorry, what? Minecraft has a microtransaction shop? can somebody explain?? when did that become a thing?
---
No, I don't think so. I stashed a bunch before I had the quest. I loot one to get the quest then grab a couple from my stash. They always come out one at a time with no option to take the stack. That's pretty nice if they programmed it like that on purpose 
---
Congrats , you found a Unicorn
---
Im pretty sure humans include players, ghouls  scorchedx supermutants, and mole miners
---
Do tamed animals ever mess up your CAMP budget and force a CAMP move to fix it? I want to try taming but I'm nervous about any bugs that might mess up my CAMP and require a move to fix because it's the opposite of a single foundation portable CAMP. Other issues like luring something to kill and remove them from camp/budget are ok. I'm curious what the downsides are. 
---
That's freaking awesome, I've considered a similar kinda trip and I gotta say I'm jealous! 
---
Hey I remember you! My current bloodied crossbow is level 25 and does 350 damage. How much for the max level one?
---
Not all online games, just those with servers where a hundred plus people could congregate (and not just for chatting). Those servers and bandwidth were and are expensive. 
---
What FO76 does with its servers is far simpler. Not as simple as some games like Guild Wars 2, but pretty simple.
---
We aren't really paying for the servers. The game cost takes care of that, new players coming in while others leave unburdening the hardware. 
---
What the atom shop pays for is development.  
---
It kind of feels good to put the caps on them when you've been killed. But yeah could be pointless 😁. I did see it work to good effect on the first day PvP dropped and everyone was running around killing like crazy but the servers have a lot of pros on there now.
---
For the most part, the majority of this post is essentially ranting against those who disagree with you. While not everyone involved in the discussion about repair kits are educated, those who are understand the damage that repair kits can cause. Even if repair kits are not pay to win, a large amount of the player base don’t see it this way. With all the problems this game had to face (horrible release, bad press, etc) repair kits are only going to make it worse. I also suggest that you try and maintain a professional tone when stating your points.
---
Exactly, why do some people always need to feel superior by generalising and throwing insults. The whole article screams I'm really triggered 
---
I'm 39 and broke as hell. I would absolutely be willing to spend money more regularly on Atoms if they were cheaper. If they were half the price they are, I'd have spent a hundred bucks by now getting furniture and power armor skins. 
---
Instead I've spent nothing. The only Atoms I've purchased, I got with a gift card someone gave me. 
---
They don't offer enough bang for their buck.
---
Yeah I have definitely noticed an increased spoil rate and increase in weapon/armor degredation which has just made me play less as it's becoming too tedious. I understand there is not much content right now and right now our content is scavenging and maintaining gear and what not but it's just aggravating right now .. if they did this on purpose; make normal gameplay more tedious and require more time/energy in scavenging to manipulate players into making purchases on the atom shop to alleviate that I'll be walking, as this isn't the first time they tried being sneaky like this to us.
---
Bottom line they have the foundation to a really good game that has it's moments and has the potential to be great for a lot of gamers but to remove gameplay action/enjoyment to encourage atom store purchases I feel is gonna hurt them in the long run. If the gameplay is fun and gets us hooked the atom store should compliment that and encourage more gameplay not make it less of a hassle or people leave.
---
Where'd he get it? I want one!
---
I’ve been seeing these. I’m excited for them but dreading them at the same time because I’ll have to redo my camp. 😣
---
Hey lol shoot me an offer, hoping to get 1k for it but 800 caps would be minimum
---
Nice post. Thanks.
---
I'm having similar thoughts. Clearly, they are having trouble funding FO76 infrastructure, improvements and content creation through their over priced cosmetic items. (900 points for that vault tech paint job is still too high and I'm only using free atom points)
---
So they want to add utility items, seems more like pay to be lazy than pay to gain any kind of advantage, which I don't have a problem with. I can see that if they don't get more money through the atom shop the future content stops coming or stops being free. I'll take utilitiesin the atom shop over that any day. And if the game ever gets to the point that I have to spend real money to stay competitive I'll quietly uninstall and move on to another game.
---
This is excellent. I hope it gets up voted to the front page, this sub needs shit like this on it right now 😁
---
Can’t find a direct link to the image, but it’s [here](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6eQmVlhbjlkX0GzGb7DB3j/inside-the-vault-looking-beyond-patch-8-april-4-2019)

I'm in my power armor 24/7 on my main character, but I made a second character to try out a fist weapon build and it just looks so much better without an outfit. Having all those random bits of scrap metal for armor along with a power fist that looks equally janky just screams post apocalypse and I love it.
---
Definitely give it a go sometime. A lot of these places have great tours too.  
---
So the White Springs is real? Pretty cool! 
---
I would agree with you on every point except this is a game with pvp elements and an entire server dedicated to pvp.
---
I get wanting to trade money for time, or time for money, if you have a surplus of one or the other.  But I like Survival and get oneshotted... Wait a second.
---
My entire argument was going to be that griefers will spend money in the store to be more effective greifers.  But they will spend that money somewhere else to grief and it might as well go to the content creators.
---
Ugh... I don't know none of this is easy and I don't like micro transactions but I hate spending money on additional content.  I hate pay to win but any game with tradeable objects becomes pay to win and only farmers and eBay see that money. 
---
That's interesting, even if your really unlucky you should of dropped at least 1 paint after 50, and based on my data, 2.  
---
 I mean its not impossible to be that unlucky I guess, ask my wife. 
---
Robot whispers "I'm not trapped in here with you, you're trapped in here with me"  
---
Samw 
---
Did you take a workshop? Maybe one of the robots team mates contested it to make you hostile against them?
---
Then everyone will stop buying the Atom shop items. Just one person buts them with free atoms and builds it in everyone's camp. What's the profit in costing caps? Bethesda doesn't gsin anything from caps. They are just fake in game money.
---
Awesome! On a related note, what do brawler and weighted do? I've never had to think about it before.
---
And because I need plastic for more shot gun shells 
---
Same
---
1100 make you happy?
---
No. Just no.
---
One of my favorite moments in the game was a number of players ended up congregating at Whitespring Station and proper started picking up the protest signs and ganking each other with them.  I was waiting for the strike breakers to show up. 
---
I started a new toon just for Survival mode yesterday. I entered the wasteland at level 2 and after an hour of playing was #1 on the hit list. Someone came after me but instead of killing me we teamed up and killed other players. I did end up getting killed a few times. Anytime I looted some aid or junk items of importance I fast traveled to my stash and stored it. My teammate logged off after a while. I was doing an event and a player in PA kept bumping into me so I hit him a couple times for no damage then went on and did my own thing and he went elsewhere. Then after another hour I was in the top 3 and stayed there until I logged off.  All in all it was a fun time considering the 20% xp boost plus double xp. I think if you can only fast travel to train stations, camp, workshops and vaults, then the train stations should already be discovered.
---
I didn't actually begin setting up a specific build until I reached level 60ish, to be frank. I think you'll be ok.
---
Good luck!
---
And the main hotel laid out in game almost exatly. The bunker is totally different though.
---
Indeed they are not pay to win. They are however the thin edge of the wedge my dude.
---
The console/windows 10 store verson of minecraft
---
Very lol, what's your GT?
---
I remember when you didn’t need a wifi connection to play a game 
---
I think they just added a blood-splattered skin for combat armor in the atom shop recently. It's not exactly what you're looking for, but it's a start.
---
Same as reddit.
---
They aren’t going to do that. That would be like selling caps. 
---
Feel your pain, I still have thousands of atoms but don’t know what to buy. Had more than 10k, bought a few PA skins and like them. I’d like to dress up my beloved shotguns and harpoon guns and gatling, each one a different skin so just by the look I know right away what they do (i.e. red for explosive and camo for anti-armor and maybe chrome for selfies), but they don’t think that way, they believe wastelanders need different hairstyles pajamas and door mats. 
---
Rose tinted much? "Back then" there were definitely patches and expansions, and of course broken games. Only you were often stuck with a broken game, At least now that doesnt happen as much. Games still had bugs. We dont remember them because we chose not to.
---
Acording to a 2017 interview with one of the developers, about 600k units
---
https://rpgcodex.net/content.php?id=10604
---
&gt; Brian: 400,000 sounds about right. I remember Fallout 1 sold 600,000 units, and Planescape sold less than that.
---
Well it seems when in doubt just throw your plastic shit in the ocean.  Imagine all the bulk plastic and shotgun shells you could craft if this were Fallout Micronesia! 
---
Sausage party ,.. get some gals in there too...
---
Not exactly what you're looking for, but i have  a  3\*\*\* L50 Hunter’s Leather Left Arm: Food/Drink/Chem Weights Reduced 20%, +1 Perception
---
What’s wifi? 😉
---
Good luck man, I decided to get a spare set, this was a mistake, it turned into a hell of a grind. 
---
I can cover the flux you don’t have. :) Stop on by. 
---
I've done it before at whitesprings resort and took no rad damage,but upon walking to the edge of the blast zone I started taking +60 rads/second. Maybe it doesn't register as an event until you reach the radius
---
There is a bug where if you go in and out of a nuke zone enough times you stop taking rad damage. I've also had it happen from a load in like this. I think some people have figured out how to do it whenever they need it as well
---
Skins, texture packs, maps, stuff like that. If you're on PC, there's still hundreds to choose from that are made by people, for free. But there's also ones made it people, and Mojang themselves, that people can by. Think it was first really big when they connected the consoles and PC versions together, "Bedrock" they call it. 
---
That's kinda my point. This is more complicated than just "I don't like it". I think if they're given very firm lines that blueprint what we as a community will accept, that's a lot better than losing the voice we currently have in the process by having a temper tantrum over what we all admit is an insignificant level of "bonus" that equates to about 60 seconds or 40 caps.  
---
The game earned a terrible reputation already from non-hardcore fallout players, just try mentioning it in /r/games.  They're going to have to work really hard to completely shift their target demographic to try and sell fallout to people that don't care about fallout and only know it's got a bad reputation.
---
you can't be, i am the mayor of watoga...
---
But, yes, sometimes they glitch out a bit, mostly eyebots :)
---
Was this ever in the game to begin with, I feel like there are a lot of outfits from 4 that need to be added.
---
Like Dark AGe of Camelot. Oh wait.
---
Like Diablo 2, oh wait, expansion. And maybe if they had a shop we would have seen more xpacs.
---
Like multiplayer halo on original xbox. Oh wait, have to pay subscription.
---
Yes, plenty of games were buy and done, but it often left us wanting more, and nothing to do but wait years for another installment, if we were lucky.
---
The games released today have ten times the content of those released 15 years ago, and you are almost never forced to spend a penny more unless you want even more content beyond that.  This rose colored goggle nostalgia shit needs to end.

Awesome pictures dude!! 👍👍👍
---
Can I ask what your luck level is please. Just curious, as there is no way I am going to test it out enough to get usable data, I'm shuddering just thinking about how long that would take :) 
---
There’s already a fight club group on Xbox 
---
Nope, I had just logged in. I spawned at the watoga train station and just took off from there. I had be logged in for about 3 mins
---
Flip me yes. I'd spend real cash on this. Skins for weapons, armor, PA and new outfits please!
---
Mind coming to me? I'm overencumbered lol
---
yeah and by that standard we'd never see any version of FO76. There wasn't the interest, the willingness to invest, the skill, or the time for it. There's no reality where a complete and bug-free version of this game was going to release this century.  Time to deal with reality.
---
I can build them? Like, I don’t see what’s different
---
Seems overly angry, maybe next time don't start your dissertation by insulting everyone?
---
Ouch! my immersion!
---
Came here to say this. This is a great policy based on thoughtful consideration of how to foster fruitful discussion. Bravo, mods.
---
uh, it's like 20 bucks if you look, 30 if you don't.
---
I can get it for 15.
---
&gt;It is more like those MMOs than it is the FPSs
---
Is it really though? I mean if we're talking about the costs for server upkeep etc. I think there are some pretty important distinctions that have to be made.
---
First, any true MMO is \*massively\* multiplayer meaning there are thousands of players on a game server at any time. In FO76 there are \~30 people max on a server at any given time. That's no different than a CoD match in terms of server load.
---
Second, there's the issue of support. In a true MMO the servers are staffed with guides, GMs, and moderators. Getting griefed? A paid staff member can help. Quest glitched? GM can hop in and fix it for you. Instance glitched or needs reset? Staff member can help. Someone's spamming something racist in chat? Staff member can help. If there's some equivalent to that in FO76 I'd love to know.
---
Third is content. While yes, you can likely get 100+ hours out of FO76 and maybe even more if you're willing to grind the same 10 events at end game, I don't know of a single MMO that had less than \*thousands\* of hours of meaningful content, events, story, factions, dungeons/instances, crafting, trading, and progression.
---
Last I just want to say that everyone (including you) is trying to move the goalposts here. The person I responded to said if a game was online it included a subscription. My examples disproved that. The cost for compute, network, and storage is literally a fraction of what it was when those games were live and those games sold far less copies than games released today. You cannot in good faith make the argument that these mobile-game monetization schemes shoved into full priced games are anything other than a way to further enrich shareholders.
---
But that's where I feel you and others are taking the wrong approach. The problem with most gamer communities is that they refuse to compromise, which makes them seem unreasonable and then the company just stops listening. 
---
Right now from Todd down, they've kinda made it clear that they're watching and listening to the Reddit subs but if the stance of the community is simply, no you can't make money, they aren't going to keep listening because that's unreasonable and unrealistic. 
---
I think the blueprint of "no bonus" and always having a drop Version that is free and either Better or equivalent in value, and keep free atoms plentiful. 
---
You're fighting tomorrows possible fight today and it just makes it seem more like illogical gamer rage than legitimate consideration of facts. 
---
I still don't understand the lack of camo considering its set in the country. How can I hunt with my crossbow without camo or at least a plaid shirt
---
I've got 11 luck and I must be approaching 40 with no drop.
---
But the developers were on a fixed schedule then. Your purchase (along with everyone else) was x% to the developer, y% to the distributor, and z% for upkeep and maintenance on the servers. after z% was spent, the servers were shut down.
---
Look at GTA V in comparison. Released in Sept 2013, it's been over 5 years that they have used microtrasactions to pay for their continued development of free DLC's and server costs.
---
They talked very frankly about cosmetics, the types of micro-transactions the game would have, all game content being available for free and a "line" and this crosses it pretty clearly.... Repair Kits, Fridges, Food and Ammo Converters, sending junk scrap back to your camp, these are all gameplay features that we want in the game and should be free as advertised, not bought in the Atomic Shop for money or after grinding tons of Atoms.
---
I want you all to go out and start a fight, and lose.
---
In the real world you can get one made by Saiga and it’s actually a solid performer. 
---
You don’t understand , nostalgia is a good thing but that’s ok you have your world we have ours . 
---
I would pay (some) real money to have BOS stuff for my camp.
---
sorry I skipped some of your logic, you spent thousands on world of warcraft, but are against anything but cosmetics.  How the F are they supposed to get any more money then. It certainly won't come from you.
---
Knight Officer is last paint, which I got. Turned in after that around 40 tech data without success
---
Wait, whitesprings is real? Nice.
---
So was CoD 15 years ago. Basic inflation says $60 in 2003 had the buying power of $85 today, so what you consider a AAA price for a game is quite a discount compared to 15 years ago.
---
We just need more styles in general. More Raider stuff, more Free States stuff, more Enclave stuff, more BoS stuff, more Responders stuff, more everything.
---
Slippery slope, not slippery soap. 
---
I’m not reading all of that lol but I have the same thing. I have blood worms, rad worms, bone worms, and the blight and they keep resetting to 44 mins. 
---
It actually uses Fluorescent which is quite easy to get in Nukespring 😄
---
Nope, not what I'm looking for, but thanks. 
---
Don’t worry,  there’s an item coming to the atomshop,  “appraisal  eye drops” just use a bottle before selling and you can check your items.
---
Bullshit is what you wrote. While I won't debate the polishness of content, in computational regards for object management, F76 scale is rather unique.
---
You can also dominate without knowing how to shoot so saying its just an FPS is fundamentally unsubstantiated.
---
Hmmm. I might be wrong but I think they fixed it when they did the whole invulnerable is survival on login thing. Anybody at a nuke site and wanna test it out with me more?
---
Mtx Shortcuts are not QOL. They inevitably make the normal path longer and more tedious to drive sales ruining game balance. Just sell them at vendors for caps if you want guaranteed access to repairs.
---
f 
---
Lol yeah continue wearing your PA in PvP then. People will be happy to take your junk after melting you.
---
Ok, I think this post should be edited and have that description added.
---
no nostalgia is bad, and we don't have different worlds. 
---
Thats interesting, so you have the other paints including Elder,  and Officer dropped last? 
---
3 people I've spoken to who has got all the paints dropped them in the posted order with Elder being last. 
---
I suspect that you are correct having given this more thought. It's a shame really. 
---
$8-$12 for a costume makes me stop and say "nope, not even with currency earned in-game, just nope". I doubt that I am alone in this perspective. 
---
Far Harbor and Nuka-World (for those who didn't buy in on the Season Pass) were, what, $20 or $30 DLC's at full price? There's my basis of comparison. A DLC with significant goodies is $10-$40 depending on scope and size at full price. 
---
So what their store tells me at their price points is that (using a $20 DLC baseline) a single costume that does nothing whatsoever is worth 40-60% of an entire DLC's worth of content? 
---
\[insert derisive laughter here\]  Eh, no. 
---
If they are truly under the gun, they need to change tack right quick. They've been bashing their brains out against a granite cliff if they expect massive revenues at these price points using "rarity" and "sales". Price these things cheaply you will move more than enough of them to exponentially improve this revenue stream, in turn adding further depth to the catalog, in turn generating more revenue. 
---
Yes QoL and convenience items are the money makers in this environment. Unlike many of the other games that do so, however, FO76 is neither "freemium" nor "free to play". They've incinerated a great deal of the good will they'd banked over the previous years in the process of launch and several PR bonfires since. 
---
I'm thinking that they may have shoved themselves between the proverbial crushing rock against a very hard place. If they go F2P/freemium, they'll get crushed. If they go P2W they'll get crushed. This leaves their cosmetics as their easiest source of revenue. There are *thousands* of assets out there between the previous 3 titles and the many mods for them that they can flip for 76 which would sell like an all-you-can-eat-buffet **if** they price them cheaply. 
---
I thought they said they fixed that bug....

Welp, time to break out my old one, then.

Nope they just wander the area outside of your camp. Sometimes they decide to do some weird voodoo shit like teleport in your house and out of it. They dont affect your camo what so ever.
---
Heatsinks are aluminum, motherboards and pcb boards are fiberglass... omg this game is something else.
---
Quiet interesting to know ! Thanks for asking, I’ll wait for an answer as well.
---
They aren’t going to do that. Power armor should be required for nuke zones. If people can just throw on a card power armor will lose one of the last things it has going for it and nobody will use it. Gonna vote no on this one. 
---
I want a cosmetic only shop. The only thing I’ve bought were the sniper outfit, masks, and some camp stuff. Most of the stuff is either too plain or just ugly. 
---
No Paladin or Elder for me, I have only previous paints
---
That candle holder, probably can scrap it for ceramic and copper.
---
You need to include your platform 😁
---
I've actually stopped relying on my Bloodied Combat Rifle for Survival PvP because of the PvP damage changes. Right now I'm just using a Medic's Assault Rifle which might as well be a crafted Assault Rifle.
---
You’re right, it’s not pay to win. It’s pay to avoid a deliberately introduced gameplay mechanic. It’s pay to have a better experience than those who don’t. That’s not what we were told this game would be about. 
---
Item degradation is a hassle. It’s one more thing that players need to manage. It doesn’t have to be there, but it is. If there’s no way to circumvent it, then it’s just part of the survival aspect of the game, part of the loop that keeps us playing. 
---
Once you introduce a way to pay to skip it, it’s just an annoyance that exists purely to facilitate cash flow.
---
It’s creating a problem and selling a solution. Unethical, plain and simple.
---
 they will keep showing until Bethesda says something 
---
Added.
---
I rather enjoy the occasional hard loss to the ballistic gutsy 
---
Sorry, xbox.
---
I hate to say this but "The Outer Worlds" release is when I get off of this lame horse for good. 
---
You should change the title to "survival isn't fun" cause it sounds like it is working as intended.
---
Even if it was me, you try getting blitzed on Nukashine and not wreak any havoc out there in the wastes. It's the drink for the post-apocalypse.
---
Being able to fight with other weapons is irrelevant:
---
\&gt;**First-person shooter** (**FPS**) is a [video game genre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_genre) centered around gun and other weapon-based combat in a [first-person perspective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_person_(video_games));
---
I also don't think what they've done with object management is that impressive. The fact that two games side by side will show objects in completely different states tells me that much of the computation is still done client side. To me, it seems all they've done is to move the same data structures and state for object health, quantity, location etc. they had already created in the single player world and moved their storage to their servers. 
---
If you know of any other interesting problems they solved that I'm missing I'd be sincerely interested to know what they are.
---
So, forever...
---
I'll keep it simple.... ME
---
also u are still able to use the ones from ur stash?
---
🅱️ig Oof 😩
---
Those kids will eventually be old enough to spend their own money. They should know the value of games has gone down since then.
---
Neither do the repair kits . In fact they offer the most basic repair u can do
---
You gotta shoot em in the head.
---
its like they punish you for playing their game)))) 
---
 In a very short time, I can launch a missile, if you need help you can come if you want, especially if you want to complete the mission of the enclave my id is shutten232 
---
I've noticed they've silent regarding that issue. Usually they respond at least once in threads when people are outraged like this. 
---
Lmfao. Only dupers and exploiters can have fun. First of all, gearing up isn't hard. Just get into trades. Second, you have no idea what you're talking about since you thought PA was PVP viable. 
---
You tried something you're clueless about and are now bitching because it didn't work. Learn the game. 
---
If he dropped 714 that was only a portion of them. If he has THAT many I’m sure he can just dupe more. 
---
It’s called the Greenbrier in real life. An amazing resort.
---
You’d think with the game in this setting camo and more basic hunting stuff would be skin pack one day one. 
---
Are you me? I'm exactly the same. Loved 3, had a hard time getting into NV (just so much open, empty desert in the early game. I got into it eventually and loved it, it just took a bit), played over 1000 hours in FO4. 
---
I played a ton of Ark, enough for me to kinda hate survival PvP games. I had to restart from scratch just too many times; as a solo player you're easy prey so the big tribes push you around and destroy your base whenever they feel like it, and as an alpha tribe you make enemies and everyone wants to raid you and become the new alpha. Logging on every day was like playing russian roulette, because you never knew if you were gonna log in to find everything destroyed and all your dinos dead. That's one thing I like about FO76, my base is safe from griefers when I'm not online to defend it.
---
While he was a bit extreme , I agree with99% of what he said . It’s a bunch of kids crying about nothing . This will only improve my gameplay 
---
Animal or human?
---
I don't think they're going to work that way. You use them in the inventory screen when you inspect an item. Sounds like it's just for weapons and armor.
---
I’ve seen some photos of them in game but word if 100% and I swear I looted one a while back. But I didn’t realize they weren’t an in game item as I remember selling to a vendor. 
---
Same! I also want to know is Japan still survived.
---
There is for sure 2 more paints for you to get. If that's not the case then the current understanding of loot tables and how loot is dropped in FO76 is off.
---
But originaly 60
---
Nah im ps4
---
watching one of the biggest disasters in gaming history is some of the best entertainment
---
We don’t need a real comprehensive server list and bookmark etc, just an option that says ‘reconnect last server’ would be sufficient after a disconnect or crash (minimum 5-6 times a day on PS4). It’s a real pain being unable to go back and pick up what you dropped because of unexpected death-then-disconnects. 
---
Right next to my camp haha. I think I've seen that once before.
---
As another commenter said, the fallout games have always been political satire. Also, what’s “political activism” about drawing attention to actual problems? Ignoring them won’t make them go away 
---
No keep demonstrating the strength of the masses!
---
I want to point something out that I feel a lot of people are ignoring, and that is the scale that games are created in now. Games back 30 years ago we're created for an emerging market. That market is now realized globally. Lost of the costs associated with game production have  been reduced and/or removed. And those that have not are overwhelmed by the sheer quantity of games purchased. 
---
76 specifically is a port. It is a game engine we, as FO consumers, already paid for with FO4. Ask anyone that isnt already a FO fan if 76 looks good and you'll get a resounding no. There are mobile games that have better looking graphics. 
---
I think a decent argument can be made that 76 is a half baked game, that is the BGS attempt to see how far they can push it's consumers before a complete rejection. Pete Hines, in multiple interviews, states the game would not be pay2win. If you think being able to purchase an item for money that affects the game isn't pay2win, then imo you are letting the games industry walk all over its consumers and hurting those of us who see it for the shitty practice it is. 
---
I can already free up a huge amount of perks from using PA (Barbarian, Evasive, Adamantium Skeleton, Ironclad, Lucky Break, Serendipity as examples), which I've used to make my non-PA char even more of a ridiculous beast. 
---
It's not just 'throwing on a card' when you need all ranks of it just to match the hidden rad resistance of PA and the last rank would be at a higher level. And you still need to put in the work to gather all the pieces you need to even match the shown resistances of a full set of PA, that takes a long while.
---
Just because you like repairing all your shit doesn’t mean I do . You can say the hassle doesn’t have to be there , but it is . So guess what? Repair packs don’t have to be there , BUT NOW THEY ARE . Not everyone wants to play the game by your rules . Suck my nuts for trying to control my life 
---
Yup. Same. I was just experimenting and having fun until past 50. Then I optimized my build until like 75 or so. 
---
Why wouldn’t they just be replace in-place like a lot of the other items with variants (like walls)
---
Wether you like 76 or not, you have to admit Bethesda did an amazing job making the world look as close to the real thing as they could
---
I think you completely misunderstood the analogy and comparing being made. My point was that producing a NES game cost significantly less and this was 35+ years ago and price of games have stayed relatively the same since whereas most other forms of entertainment have quadrupled or more. (For reference, Movie ticket in 1985 was about $3.00 per ticket today average price is about $12.00) .
---
Average Nintendo game with no future development required had an cost of production at 250,000 per title, this also usually included marketing budget title sold for +/-$40. Today a current generation title averages about 10mil to produce not including marketing budget and sell for about +/- $60 and require an average of 1 mil for a 3 yr life cycle of ongoing development for a AAA game with active user base. 
---
There's a real reason small gaming companies are either being bought out or dying like flies. 
---
I probably won't be playing in a year or two anyway. By then I will have moved on to a new game. 
---
Thats awesome! As a non-American, I didn’t know Whitesprings for example actually exists! 
---
You can add me. I'm lvl 104, but help you with ome plans and supplies and battle some of the bigger stuff with you. Shinigamigrlkj13
---
If we can set up our phone or tablet to hotkey everything, this would make it easier to get things done. You could easily select things to switch between items and perk card layouts.
---
That's... fair actually. I just hope they have a "Survival w/ New Characters" mode when the beta is over. As it stands, it's a "get murdered by level 396 players right after you fast-travel" simulator.
---
Different color and side railings. They’re not available in the Atom Shop yet so...don’t think anyone can place them down yet. 
---
+karma thank you for the business my guy
---
Most people don't realize that point.  I'd be all for this if the plastic items had chinese characters on them.
---
I was reading a book called Wraith (check it out pretty cool) and one part takes place in the Greenbrier. They described the tacky carpeting and talked about the row of shops. It was cool because I was able to completely picture it after spending so much in game time there
---
I don't really know how common it is because it only happened to me once - the whole shenaningan of having a team member contest the workshop and immediately being murdered to death by the rest of the teammates half way across Appalachia.
---
The reason why it only happened once is because I proceeded to ignore workshops since except the few rare occassions when I was the last player on the server and even then I only took over workshops that produce resources that cannot be obtained consistently any other way in the game: pre-war (thus rad-less) packaged food and 100% charge fusion cores.
---
I found the whole experience frustrating and not having any control over it - as opposed to single player games where if I find something vexing or obnoxious I mod it so it behaves more to my taste - the only reasonable choice \[for me\] was avoiding it altogether.
---
I built a gambling machine using game assets, inside my bar/fight club. I would love if you could build proper arcade booths for the pipboy games. They are already fallout 4 assets so they could put it into the atom shop.
---
To be fair, have you seen a lot of evidence of long-term planning involved in the release of this game?
---
Thank you! I can’t see the color very well, and didn’t notice the side railing
---
What’s going on? You never responded to my Xbox Live message or my game invite. Is this no longer for sale? A little communication goes a long way b
---
Pretty useless for a junk collector like myself.
---
Why?
---
Does Minecraft have a store? I've been playing it a lot for the past couple months and I thought they get of minecoin
---
Maybe the SBQ drinks Nukashine, that's why the body always vanishes.
---
No prob. I want those stairs bad. I use that build piece a lot in my CAMPs!
---
For sure, I would definitely pick them up if they  popped up in the atom shop.
---
I'm boycotting boycotting.
---
There duped pal. Bethesda are banning people still so if I were you I would just drop them. It's a shit serum anyway 
---
You mean, after we ship it to them?
---
And yes, I get that over a billion people in China produces a ton of trash.  But it doesn't help that a lot of our trash goes overseas to Asia as well....
---
It's called the Greenbrier! It has an amazing history. The bunker underneath Whitespring is a nod to the fact that the Greenbriar was the bunker for the President of the United States. http://www.greenbrier.com/Activities/The-Bunker/Bunker-Tours.aspx
---
I want the beeping backpack to annoy people nearby. Or people run up to me only to be disappointed. 
---
Yeah generations, that's right. Compare an adult to a child.
---
I'll hop right on
---
The syringer has really good potential. The endangerol barrel apparently can stack per player on single target. Was trying to test on Queenie but tests are incomplete. But it does help at the scorched earth event we had 4 people shoot her and it seemed like she was way weaker than needed even the 20 with crap gear was doing something. 
---
The bunker underneath Whitespring real too.  The Greenbrier was the bunker for the President of the United States.  They give tours of it if you visit.  http://www.greenbrier.com/Activities/The-Bunker/Bunker-Tours.aspx
---
I had 100% success handing them 1 at a time from an alt while placing in a container was spotty at best. 
---
Add me as well, Maneetoe. I have a level 56 Jack-of-trades, but also just started a new character to specialize that is level 7.
---
Cringe
---
Ummm
---
They promised cosmetic only in the still shop in October. They're basically EA now
---
Right
---
Thay added the vault tec camp collection thats pretty cool
---
They’re probably thinking up some PR response to justify their decision that we’ll read and immediately know they’re full of shit
---
Not deliberately.
---
Unless some of the new content is a three hour (or more) long kill fest in an interior cell that one cannot leave without failing the objectives and contains no workbenches as the game stands I have no use for them when I can repair to 200% durability using perks and my own resources thus I have no use for them.
---
They cannot be sold or transferred so they are just dead weight to me.
---
So glad I stopped playing this game.
---
Wow thats very interesting, thanks! 
---
They can die via environmental damage such as falling, so that's entirely possible. Maybe tame a flying creature if you can? 
---
Not so much boycotting but just can’t see myself ever spending precious atoms on them when I can repair my weapons to 200% if I do that at a workbench with my weapon artisan perk. Repairing my gear at the end of a session has become part of my normal routine so I can happily live without them tbh.
---
No they said the kit it self is one time use, not the purchase. We have zero idea at the moment either way, but since every other one time use item is a recipe it's not a far stretch at all to consider that is what they might mean here as well.
---
Your son didn't spend $60 up front to get the game. Why would kids care about spending their parents money?
---
Maybe take the game away, have him save his allowance for a year to buy Fallout 76 at full price, and see just how happy he is with the Atom Shop then?
---
Does the Abandoned Bog Town exist in real life? I ask because a sign on the diner reads Adelaide's diner. I live in Adelaide Australia and NEED that sign as a camp decoration. 
---
I'm an older gamer but I don't mind cosmetics being sold - I pick what I want and generally am able to get stuffs I want the most.  If I really want something I can afford to pay for some atoms, and I don't mind that given the game is seeing updated.  Reached the point now though with more recent sales tactics - removal of items, addition of non-cosmetics incoming - all these seem to me like greedy and sleazy sales tactics used in the online gaming era from a lot of F2P games (which FO76 isn't even to begin with).
---
Just a smart consumer/buyer here - but I still do like some swag even as an older gamer.  I bought 2 Unstoppables costumes amongst other frivolous things with atoms I earned playing the game, my happiest indulgence is the KLL neon sign.  And I'm one of the lucky few that has Blackbird PA paint.
---
The atom challenges are getting out of hand so I'm going to have to be more picky what I spend on - that's another issue I have with recent changes, they made some atom challenges really silly like the 3 levels while intoxicated.  So where I would have spent real money on atoms previously, the recent direction of the atom store has lost me as a customer for purchasing atoms with real world money.
---
&gt;I understand that it COULD lead to bad things, but I'll save my vitriol for when it does.
---
Nah, fam, that ain't how we do things here. If you ain't overreacting over speculation of possible worst case scenarios and threatening to murder Bethesda devs first born children, then maybe you don't belong here.
---
It almost sounds like this is a trap...   
---
* Herd Mentality, by all accounts, is a crappy serum and hard to sell.
---
* The player you killed seems to be a Duper to have that many.
---
* Bethesda is cracking down on Dupers.
---
So, if I were a Duper and I wanted to get ultimate revenge on someone who ends up killing me in Survival mode, I too would carry the serum that I can't unload get the ultimate revenge....
---
I think it's quite a shooter, not FPS.
---
PS4 
---
Staying away from the game entirely.  You've already spent money on this game, so you are lying to yourself if you say that you are boycotting anything at this point. 
---
The only thing  that would send a message is turning the game into an abandoned MMO/ ghost town.
---
And if you aren't willing to do that, Todd wins and they will keep pulling this kind of shit. 
---
Love this game, but god it looks like a ps2 game lol 
---
I do have a couple of mods, but I did uninstall and reinstall last night and that didn't help. I could try updating or uninstalling the mods, though 
---
Here's some photos of the interior of the Greenbrier. It's as bad as they say. [https://imgur.com/gallery/2Mt09yb](https://imgur.com/gallery/2Mt09yb)
---
Totally agree, but Bethesda are aware of who duped items, who found or bought them. I've had hold of them for a couple of days and posted to most forums.
---
Basically games designers, engineers etc can find out anything about a player, it takes time and a good eye but you can't hide your actions, especially on server based gaming. So whether they're duped or not, I won't face consequence due to the fact, a recorded fact, that I found them, looted them from another player.
---
A few weeks back when people were complaining about being banned, it was because in some way or another they cheated the game mechanics, via duping or breaking a mechanic, as in finding a loop hole and then spoiling the whole fucking game for actual gamers.
---
I wont be banned nor will anyone who bought them from me, because its fact that I wasn't the duper, and its also possible that theh weren't duped, the possibility is unlikely but still a remainder.
---
That said and done, what I'm trying to say is bethesda don't just ban anyone, they have good reason, they have facts. 
---
You should use whichever you want. Combat  armor outclasses Robot in terms of dmg resistance, but unless you're going for some PvP metabuild Robot won't hold you back too much. 
---
FO76 is a great game already, but I have done everything. Anything that adds more nuance is what we want to see to keep this machine moving? Like the idea I’m in if I’m around.
---
This is a good thought 
---
This right here.
---
I suggested this a way while back. 
---
 But just to add:
---
Add the mailbox to the list of camp items. Make it a standard metal on wood pole and slap a ton of design on the atomic shop. 
---
Make mail retrievable by account and not player. And for the first couple of weeks give the boxes a limit on number of mail you can get. To test server stability. 
---
Make a new event where players can help a malfunctioning postbot that will mail the players that complete the event packages to mail out and or keep. 
---
We can also use this feature to receive notes and info from Bethesda. If for some reason we don’t read parch notes or ITV. 
---
My pleasure. WV has a ton of neat stuff in it, I was so happy Bethesda picked it for a game!  
---
There was another player that posted a ton of side by side whitesprings pictures when she toured it. It was super cool. 
---
So i also just finished up hitting Elder. While not tracking the % of drops I was keeping track of where I was finding success getting TD.
---
Charleston Herald is another good source.  You have something like 12 cabinets and 2 safes.  I had bad luck in VTU.  I'd also hit Flooded Trainyard - 5 safes.  Harpers Ferry - 4 (5?) safes and the 3 safes in the Watoga Civic Center suites.
---
I share this opinion. I'm personally not fucked about it. You can still get repair kits in the world and from drops. If someone wants to pay a couple bucks to not use a workbench, whatever. Go for it. 
---
This game is incredibly too easy to be complaining about p2w, especially when the features in question aren't even a factor in "winning" lol. Even of the hinted features, none of it seems to weigh heavy in a competitive nature. Literally just QoL for people who don't like the survival portion of the game. 
---
Hey do you know the name of the author? I'm interested but there are a few books with that name 
---
FWIW 
---
I remember paying for the initial cost and subsequent subscription for WoW as well.
---
I was fine til the game direction went to pay to win and all the hard work I achieved to get better gear was just devalued by an aggressive pricing model.  Watching  kids get equal or better gear, mounts armor, in 1/3 of the time was disheartening . Had to quit for grad school anyway.
---
I think if bethesda does the same I will probably find something else to play. Not hating or criticizing Bethesda, it’s how the industry sustains itself. Just not how I see myself wanting to invest my time and money.
---
Exactly lol. I chased him but he jumped server before I could hit him again. Doesn't bare to think what else he had. He literally gave me enough aid and chems to heal the wasteland and get it high. 
---
I’m sure moving over more old assets is something they’re looking into; they’d be fools not to. 
---
Still, bear in mind: online games don’t only have running costs, they also have *opportunity* costs. They can’t just break even; they need to bring in enough revenue to justify the live team not to be working on something else instead. 
---
I think during beta I saw once Sutton ST booth to be open. Or right after launch, very early anyway.
---
Crazy. Never ever again seen it.
---
Bad ass!!!!
---
These are the factions I want to see, realistic militarized skins vs irreverent ironic skins. Ghillie suit snipes a manta-man from outside compass range, is one-shot by a bloodied commie-whacked guy with a fruit hat while trying to loot the paper bag
---
I missed that one...   I have a picture of one teddy bear in a pot, the other with a spatula and cutting board...  I just assumed that teddy bears were cannibals...   but I guess that they like the occasional hotdog too....
---
Idk. It's kinda funny to me that everyone wants Bethesda employees to slave tirelessly to add content for the game but nobody wants to pay them lol. 
---
It's QoL items that aren't necessary and don't give you an edge over any other player. Couple that with it literally paying for new content and more bug fixes. It's a good thing imo. 
---
Thanks Puckseason I'll add that now. Where as I simply missed Watoga High School from list I had no idea about Chareston Herald, that would be a great place for an alt to hunt.  
---
 VTU was a last resort for me, seemed like the spawn rate was much lower, and the cabinets a pain timewise to reach. 
---
Your son is 8. He doesn't know much about these things. Pretty sure old 8 you would have the same reaction as him. It's up to you to teach him that it's bad to accept scummy business practices. 
---
I honestly think your reply if beyond fucking idiotic. Why dupe probably the worst serum, why post it on the forums, why carry that in Survival... Its all why, why, why...
---
Your trying to come across as some superior but the fact remains that if there was anything dodgy going on I'd have already been banned. 
---
Or or y'know maybe they're gathering all the feedback and making response on the next ITV?
---
I know, crazy idea right?
---
PARENTING 100
---
I’m not pvp only pve, so Robot is good too? 
---
&gt;Lol yeah continue wearing your PA in PvP then. People will be happy to take your junk after melting you.
---
Every kind of armor in the game melts.
---
Thank you for sharing!
---
I'm more thinking about how in Fallout 1, 2, 3, 4, and to a lesser extent New Vegas we had certain aspects in our backstory that didn't lend itself to some builds or playstyles. The only thing holding us back is the fact that everyone is a Mary Sue (the best at what they do) and the lore supports any type of character. You wanna be a psycho? Those were in the vault on nearly constant lockdown. We were scientists, builders, even militarily trained and secured our own access to the vault
---
Add in the negative effects too. Like rad ant lager giving you -50 carry weight after it expires. 
---
Old MMOs were a subscription service. That's how they fueled money for employees to add content to a never-ending game. 
---
This does not have a subscription service. In order for the game to continue to be worked on and updated, money is required. The shop is necessary. 
---
I'm in my 30s. 
---
Don’t drop them all at the same time that’s how Bethesda catches you, they track what’s dropped on the ground and what quantity but not where it comes from
---
If they do this they may as well do caps for cash.....😡
---
Good on you! I'd sell it so fast. I really want that mask but 250 is better 
---
Actually the Elder paint is a much lighter matte gray (with some distressing/rust) than the Paladin paint. 
---
&gt; &lt;&lt;Paint&gt;&gt; 6% Chance of Drop. Note, Starting with Knight, they drop in order, but only after you have learned previous rank.
---
That's interesting, but... With a drop rate that low, how were you able to confirm that you can only get it after you learn the previous one? Maybe it would have dropped eventually anyway?
---
I did the tour, it's absolutely worth it. The bunker is totally different in game though.  
---
Yeah, back in my day, we spent $60 and we got the whole game. And by whole game, I mean a dozen or so levels that are maybe 2 or 3 minutes long each, and made up of like 5 different enemies, but sometimes they are different colors and move faster or hit harder, so it's almost like there's 10 or 20 different enemies.
---
Now you pay $60 and all you get is some massive open world with hundreds of hours of exploration and content and huge numbers of enemies, outfits, weapons included in the base game, and then they expect you to pay more for additional content? Bollocks.
---
I won't be band, Bethesda can basically see your in game actions. I may have, may not have picked up a duped item, at the end of the day I picked up, that's all that matters, regardless of how they were made or whatever. 
---
Not saying you would be but that’s just what I’ve been told, better safe than sorry 
---
Your mistake is  using power armor instead of  impossible to find legendary armor acquired though RNG or bought on ebay.  (That was sarcasm).
---
Ah, so they changed it from FO4 then?
---
That is the worse.  I legit only place my shower down (store it in workshop) when I want to use it for this exact reason.  
---
I run bloodied build so I love radiation. I don’t use it often 
---
Because they sure listened to feedback regarding things like creation club, the canvas bag, Nuka dark rum, etc. I have very little faith in Bethesda at this point to do right by their consumers.
---
“Fool me once shame on you, fool me 6 more times and I’m a dumbass”
---
This is only if true if you think "left leaning" is anyone who isn't a Nazi, and "right leaning" people are all Nazis ore Nazi sympathizers. Wolfenstein has been about killing Nazis in every iteration of its existence, and if that hurts your feelings because you sympathize with Nazis, good.
---
LITERALLY!
---
I’ve been seeing all these posts and I couldn’t agree more!
---
I understand it as a “gateway purchase” that will allow them to put more shit in, but:
---
1) Repairing a weapon using Atom points is already a stupid choice (the parts + 200% perks are a much better idea)
---
2) You can literally just do what most players do with micro transactions in-game and just NOT BUY THEM. It really is not that hard lmao
---
Awesome. 1 more mission to do 400 times once you've done the very limited other missions 400 times already. You know what gets me excited? When game developers release finished games.
---
Totally agree lots of vaults open just for trade.

We are Cold spear and we wear all combat armor with marine wetsuit underneath or we wear camo painted t-51b/ X-01
---
More more more please!
---
I saw them in the build menu a couple weeks ago.
---
I am still happy seeing people visit my state because of FO76. Did you visit any other locations? 
---
Solid advice there, wishing I would’ve done that now!

Games used to be around $50- $40. It would have 200+ hours of content, a whole little booklet of information about the game in it, neat things that you could unlock, split screen multiplayer, and if you bought a prequel your game would search your memory, see that you played it, and unlocked more content for you.
---
NOW games cost $60, but you wont get all the content unless you buy the super gold silver deluxe ultimate edition and then buy totitos pizza rolls for the extra xp boost and then the SEASON PASS and you get the super cool DLC which is just stuff that they put a paywall over that was supposed to be a part of the game. Also the storylines make no sense bc they had to cut a bunch of stuff out of the original gsme
---
So, why is there a lighthouse that far inland?  
---
...and are there really cranberry bogs in WV? That seems like more of a Massachusetts thing. 
---
im excited, cant wait to get off a ton of whiskey revives
---
I played a few PTW Phone games like FFXV and heroes of the galaxy. In those games, you could technically do everything without spending, it just took longer. a LOT longer. Some of the wait times were OVER A YEAR! Whales could just pay to skip the grind. Sure there were in game ways to speed things up, but nothing was as quick as a credit card.  It was all "FAIR" everyone has access to everything, but without spending thousands, you were vulnerable to anyone's credit card.  
---
And this is the line everyone is concerned with. In those games, you knew you were the small fish. In fallout 76, so far, there has been no way to "Grow a gap" between whales and fish. no matter how much you have spent. It has happened a bit in trading marketplaces, you could buy armor and guns for cash, but in the end RNG could provide any cashless player good enough equipment to compete, pve or pvp. 
---
Adding in PTW elements would completely change the tone of how fallout feels.  There would be no ammo dropping for newbs, no friendly random encounters, and everyone would always feel vulnerable, even the whales. Their investment is under attack, eww. That is just the opposite end of the "I am the master of this land then I put on power armor and am invincible" feeling.  And without a huge guild supporting the group, on 24 player servers, then it is even more intense.
---
I don't think the issue is so much is the item shop a good thing young vs old, it may be more about people being invested in the franchise. New players want a fun game no matter what, fans want a fun fallout game.  PTW just does not fit in this franchise. It has always had a tone of making things better in the face of ruthless scum, not becoming worthless scum.
---
Most of West Virginia looks like the Abandoned Bog Town. 😆
---
I feel like last time I tried to change variant on something like a wall I had to store the roof before I could change the wall. Who knows though bud...it was awhile ago. 
---
I think this would be a great idea for earth week haha
---
I’m 17, and I think that this atom shop thing is terrible, and it’s a paid game already.
---
They could make better cosmetics or paid private servers.
---
I feel like their only pleasing a small majority or players. This stuff should be easy to pump out, half of it is already in the game so it’s not like it needs designing. 
---
It’s so cool. I work at one of the locations in the game and have been to pretty much every place featured in the game. 
---
Just add the 4 horseman power armor already.
---
These people again? I thought we stamped them out?
---
The most unimmersive part for me is when I just see game breaking bugs and when it just feels like a complete clunky mess. That’s mostly the reason why I’m playing it again, to see if they’ve fixed it. By all means I’ve been having a great time finding all of the stories in the Flatwoods and Morgantown so far
---
"Basic Repair Kits are single-use consumables that immediately restore one of the items in your inventory to 100% condition.", "Basic Repair Kits will be unlockable in the Atomic Shop using Atoms you’ve purchased or those you’ve earned for free by completing in-game challenges." Mm, I'll agree there's a bit of wiggle room there for things to work out slight better in the consumers favor but I'm getting a bad feeling about this based on their wording and implications for future utility items in the Atomic Shop, hope we're both wrong honestly and this just becomes a normal game feature :)
---
Nukashine grenades would be fun as hell to, they could release a cloud of nukashine and send enemie players on a trip hahaha.
---
Common experience, everyone who has collected all the paint has received them in this order, and the only people with a spare copy of the plans are those who did not learn the paint until they dropped a duplicate. 
---
 This is what I did, For example I ground out 2 copies of the Knight paint, learned one, the next paint that dropped was the Knight captain. Repeated through to Elder. 
---
Not really, all you have to do is go into a looking fir group post and message the guy for an invite
---
Starting bid... one BILLION caps... mwahahaha
---
&gt;There's a certain point where maybe some people need to start considering that they can't afford gaming as leisure  
---
or make better choices
---
By your logic minecraft is a fps
---
I don't think it does, but it could be one of the really tiny obscure places.
---
I'm excited! Of course the Real Test is if it's Solo-able 
---
The other side of that is that when you bought a game, that was it.  No bugs ever got patched.  No new content was ever going to EVER be made, unless it was a full sequel.  
---
What you're missing is that those patches and DLCs are additional content, over and above what you used to get.  You have this perspective that you use to get the "whole game", but that's unfair.  The better perspective is that there use to never be anything BUT the base game, as launched, bugs and all, forever.
---
I wish that there was a place we could convert metal into springs and screws.
---
Steel, aluminum maybe?
---
Would be a cool workshop idea.
---
Yup. I remember games looking like shit with terrible voice acting (if any) and many mechanisms to ensure you can never win.
---
I scrapped a combat armour leg piece without the paint today and got the leg plan 
---
Wow! That's so cool! Hey quick question.  Are the real sites located in the same spots roughly?  Like in the game white spring is South East ish of the lighthouse I think, so in real life is like the locations the same? Or is this a dum question lol
---
I got you bro. No one ever fixed my copy of E.T.
---
Still wrong era dude
---
Wrong. Nowadays "player Engagement" as they call it (which means microtransactions for non-corporates) are what makes games like these excel. Yes they get their money worth and definitely make a profit with just the sales already,(please guys, stop buying this "they need MTX to make free updates!" crap. This has been disproven time and time again). But the real big dollars that let the CEO's buy their 6th Ferrari come from players who keep playing and by extension keep spending. That's the only reason "Games as a Service" has become so popular. You can keep milking a game you only had to develop once, by employing a skeleton crew that makes some updates from time to time and keep the shop filled with stuff people want to buy. 
---
Bethesda cares about everyone they can get to dish out some cash for the Atom Shop.
---
You don't know that. You also could say the kids/teens are the ones with no disposable income. They, both, are non sense based in a situational experience. Although, we have some hard information.
---
This is a mature rated game. Only people mature should play the game, people who know how have healthy fun. Of course 17+ means they're teens. In the future, I expect a game rated Adult Only wouldn't be a bad business. Unfortunately, society considers games a kid's matter.
---
I don't like pay to win. I couldn't play a game like that. But this is not pay to win. Mtx are not necessarily pay to win. People who only see white and black are a serious problem.
---
Yes but individual limbs dont come off. Arms and legs cant be removed individually 
---
Ya man you get! 👍👍 I had E.T too lol
---
It would be nice to edit the post with this info, but just to be clear, you got 100% Success by the Alt dropping a piece on the floor and main picking it up, and if it was not flagged as quest the main simply dropped it and picked up again, is that correct? 
---
 I may have mis-read, but if this is the case then for sure that did not work for me. 
---
Lol, I think I got carried away with the story.  Either way, they finally got cured! 8 days straight, and all the diseases disappeared when I picked up the 5th disease sludge lung. They went from 43 mins to gone as soon as that last one appeared. Now, I just have the one disease left, still resetting the time
---
no
---
thank you
---
You're already doing that if you know it or not my guy
---
&gt; The more you bash games like this that are not common the more you kill gaming by not praising the actual good practice
---
What good practice? Releasing half-assed games for full price with the promise that "we'll fix it later"? Lawl. I praise games when a game deserves to be praised. I'm not praising a turd.
---
&gt; the game still has content
---
What content? Once you've explored everything, which does take a while, I agree, there is basically nothing to do. The last few times I played FO76 was me running through the map looking for a nice spot to build my camp. Then I spent 3 hours building it and then ... yeah, I went offline, because there is nothing to do. I have a nice camp, best in slot gear ... what is there to do? PvP? In this broken shit? Doubt it. More exploring? Nope. Scorchbeast queen? LMAO. Once you have a few hundred hours in the game (which I certainly have because I'm an idiot and for a long time I denied the fact that the game is shit) there is nothing left (and a lot of these hours were filled with running through the map without doing anything), which is simply unacceptable for a game like this. It's not a story driven game where you play through the story and put it away afterwards.
---
&gt; If you want more people to actually agree with you and “stop ruining the market” then don’t treat them like shit, like they’re stupid and killing it.
---
Then stop ruining my favorite franchises with your attitude of "oh well it's fine it's not THAT bad". Then I won't call you stupid. It's simple. Whenever Bethesda doesn't COMPLETELY fucks up all of you here are like: "Oh SO great bethesda we love you may I carry your child please?" instead of calling them out CONSTANTLY for their bullshit. The Anthem-Subreddit is doing it exactly right, they're calling out bioware for their shitshow of a game and, what can I say, anthem probably has had more progress since release than FO76 had until today, even tho it's still shit. But then again, bioware is a halfway talented developer studio, while bethesda is nothing but a shell of it's former self.
---
And it's impossible to be "more salty". I love the fallout franchise, I grew up with it, I have thousands of hours in FO2, 3 and 4, I have a fucking fallout tattoo on my right upper arm and seeing how bethesda kills one of favorite game franchises in front of my eyes and parades it's corpse around like a fucking puppet is making me more salty than you could ever imagine.
---
It would. Not much, but at least they would have been honest then. They promised multiple times that MTX will definitely be only of cosmetic nature and nothing else, and now they're breaking that. 
---
Me and the boys been talkin bout this sense the game came out it would honestly be grate to have something to match the enclave armor and even just military stuff in general
---
The story that I've heard for the lighthouse it that the main shaft of a wind turbine fell off a truck and was damaged. The owners of the land it now sits on bought it, fixed it, and turned it into a certified lighthouse.
---
Weighted ignores armor on melee attacks, brawler doesn’t work.
---
But the repair kits are not a cosmetic item, they are a consumable.
---
Grenadier and explosives expert, I'm annihilating things with my MIRV frags. I pretty much turn all my frags into MIRVs now. 
---
More variety in hairstyles for the ladies, please. And not just bombastic or extreme styles. I like my character to resemble the real me and with such lack of variety in the hair styles that modern women wear, it seems like we are all running around the wasteland with the same shoulder length bob. It's disheartening to come across another female character that looks like a clone of my character. I'm always checking the atomic shop to see if new styles have been added, but it's still the same beehive and megaton. We also need some ethnic diversity in hairstyle choices as well. The point is, i would BUY different hairstyles if more options were presented, and I'm sure I'm not the only one. 
---
Thing is, I HAVE it still...
---
No I had 100% success of the quest triggering when trading 1 TD at a time from an alt to a main vs. it being put in a container or being dropped and then picked up by the main.
---
Well he's the guy who went on record saying the Atom Shop will strictly be for cosmetics, because there is a line, and other companies have crossed it many times, but they at Bioware would never do that and will stay committed to staying on the right side of the line. 
---
If I gave you an empty water bottle and you threw it into the ocean, who’s the one that littered? Once I gave it to you, it becomes your responsibility. You can refuse to take it, of course.
---
Find a different game to play then, many people are satisfied with fallout 76 and are exited for the new content. 
---
Unless there are mechanics that require multiple people to do multiple things at once this is going to be an easy solo for endgame players. I hope they do this thing up for us.
---
Damn me too still have all my Atari stuff 
---
As for the cranberries; yes, but they are not cultivated like in MA. It's more of a wilderness hiking area. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranberry\_Glades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranberry_Glades)
---
I feel bad for some of these people's moms
---
Bullshit. Repair kits are them getting greedy, not them needing more money to make content. They pretty much say they're testing the waters to see how much shit they can get away with and what we'll scream about. This crap needs to be shut down hard.
---
Except there are 4 ranks of Rad Resistance.  It's a hefty commitment in Endurance to have it in the first place, which feels like a reasonable counterbalance to the "throw on a card" argument.
---
Plus, currently while in a team, two players can share Radsponge and survive in Nuke Zones, which doesn't seem any more plausible.
---
It's not that I don't think Power Armor should be essential in Nuke Zones - I don't have a problem with that concept - it's more that what we have right now is kind of misleading because Power Armor has some magical rad reduction capability which is unavailable for a non-PA user, no matter how much they get their rad resist up.  I'd call it a beginner's trap.  The game makes it look like survival is possible when it's really not.
---
As always though, honesty wins. If they come out and say "hey guys, we know we promised player vending, but we ran into issues, it just doesn't really work right now, we have to delay it" people would have been fine. But now going "Hey guys, we're gonna rip you off after explicitly promising we wouldn't!" is definitely not the way to distract people. 
---
Spectacular argument.
---
Does minecraft's core gameplay loop \*revolve around\* gunplay / swordplay with enemies? What percentage of minecraft gameplay would you say revolves around fighting / gunplay? What percentage of FO76's gameplay revolves around fighting / gunplay?
---
Where'd you get your son? I want one!
---
One of the reasons I love this game is I used to live up in western new york and drive to north carolina pretty regularly.  Pretty much all the towns are recognizable, but there are so many things I didn't know were real.  The lighthouse for example.
---
I'm with you. Yup, that would be substantially easier than my method. Updating now. 
---
Fair enough. Guess I'll be waiting for duplicates too. I haven't turned in nearly as many data (25+ maybe) and got Knight just a few days ago.
---
Like I said, Combat outclasses it, but not by much. If Robot looks cooler too you than go for it, it won't hold you back from PvE things.
---
I literally had to, that's my point. 6 months after release for an online survival game and players are out of content, cahhhmawhnnnn.
---
That's it. Every company needs to make money. But companies make money without having to straight up rip their customers off. Game Companies nowadays can't settle for "A ton of money", they want ALL of the money. And if there is just a cent they missed then the game is a failure. And with this sentiment it's clear that the quality of the product suffers, and because of that people are unhappy, and by extension pay less. Happy customers are recurring customers.
---
I think the perk should stack up to maybe 60 percent less rad damage. Nuke zones should still be deadly.
---
I do love trapper and robot armor, and personally believe that Trapper should be buffed to Heavy Trapper from F4, where it was a respectable armor set.
---
It’s very weak in this game.
---
Well Vault-Tec didn't build just one Vault either right?
---
The left doesn't want to meme, the right only does that to indoctrinate Fortnite kiddies
---
You get it 👍 old timer here too 
---
so basically you're shit at the game and want your mom to support this joke of a game so you can be good at it? Gotcha
---
i dunno bout u, but it seemed that bethesda gave up quite a bit on fo76 after it launched horribly. there doesn't seem to be much effort moving forward, just peacemeal things here and there that doesn't change the game much. i doubt they're benefiting much from mtx here, but i don't know the sales figures of course.
---
Do you have one? Still looking.
---
Someone mentioned in a different post that the first encounter is for him to "analyze you" and to load an insult in the chamber until the next encounter.

---
Cosmetics only and having future expansions and additional content being free are literally the only 2 reasons why I don't care about the Atom Shop being there. However, with them no longer just having cosmetics only is really, really starting to activate my almonds
---
Yeah, but sometimes I cba farming ballistic fibre to repair my broken armour. RK can come in handy then.
---
Stays until killed. The person who has the bounty loses no caps on death.

1. It my Sugar Mamma not my mom.
---
2. I think I am ok at the game. Not shit. 
---
First paragraph in and I’m already done with this reply lmao. “the actual good practice” maybe that was worded wrong I’ll give you that much I don’t type as well on mobile but my entire reply should have clearly gotten the point across that I’m talking about other games and gaming as a whole. 
---
Oh also at the second last part all your doing is proving yourself more wrong. I don’t like Bethesda I don’t defend or dick ride them? “Stop ruining MY favourite franchises with your attitude of no its not that bad”
---
1) it’s your favourite but you have no choice decision, or relevancy to the franchise your just a fan fuck off.
---
2) I’m not defending Bethesda for the 70th time I’m literally just telling you that I find a game fun bc it’s literally just FO4 with some needed QoL improvements and online component lmao.
---
3) nobody cares about your fallout tattoo or your thousands of hours.
---
Your isolating yourself from people that still don’t want to see games be fuck ups and etc because you treat anyone with a separate opinion as incorrect and dumb and you don’t even read what you say. You are the average shit type of person that makes reddit communities unbearable. Please do us a favour and get over yourself.
---
you have the target? to launch 
---
You can buy health, weapon, and XP boosters on the atom shop?  Do tell because I’d for sure call that pay to win.  A repair item because you’re too lazy to fast travel or even walk a minute or 3 to a spot to repair... that seems like pay to be lazy.  I have no problem with pay to be lazy items in the game, in fact I’d love for there to be a lot of people like that to keep the game going a few years.
---
I've just brought the game and I'm downloading it as I type. What's the issue with repair kits? 
---
Lol remember when you couldn’t SAVE your game? You had one session to get as far as you could. 16 glorious bits.
---
Yeah i havent bought a repair kit all week. That will show them that we are playing hardball and not to be messed with.
---
The second one definitely is not anything I’ve seen before. The first one is really only prevalent when I load into the game or when I pick up a legendary item.
---
I think there is plenty of content in the game, obviously more is good, but this game wasn't released void of stuff to do.
---
I really hope it will become my new go to legendary items farming spot. If the drop rates are worse than whitesprings the dungeon will be a bit of a flop.
---
They have several teams working on 76 from what I've gathered. Their initial income from launch should have been sufficient (given the $ amounts I'm finding) to have not only recouped development and marketing costs but paid their entirety of expenses for at least a year after launch, opportunity costs included. Depending on the development costs for Starfield and ES6 ... maybe not so much wiggle room after 76's launch if that revenue was used to account for (and thus remove/recoup) not one project's development costs but all three projects' development costs.
---
That might be the 'thing' I've been missing. 
---
They seem to have counted on a much deeper money well via 76 to fund not only 76 itself but to further fund their upcoming projects' developments and it's not happening the way that was anticipated / expected. 
---
Seems like their best bets moving forward are two-fold in terms of minimizing opportunity costs: asset flipping and convenience items. Is the Atomic Shop deliberately hobbled such that it can only display, what, 200 or so purchasables? 
---
They really do need to get their PR act together. It's killing them out of hubris to not own up to their mistakes. Bite the bullet and **own** them *before* introducing convenience items. The Fallout community will be far more forgiving than they seem to be giving them credit for if their big fish do so. 
---
I wouldnt
---
Updated, thanks very much, quick question, was your alt able to reloot containers? I'm still testing but as per post it looks like they can only loot once. 
---
They nerfed the durability perk cards in hope that these repair kits become  ''the thing to buy and spend money on''
---
It was [a joke.](https://wvtourism.com/lighthouse/) 
---
You don't get after all do you? Yes you can already do that in game. But you can just pay some money, skip all that, and be right back in the fray. Regardless of how big it is, that gives people who dish out money a competitive advantage over other people. And even if it wasn't the problem, it's still straight up a lie by Bethesda who told us multiple times that "There's a line that other companies crossed but they wouldn't", because the Atom Shop would stay purely cosmetic. Well guess what, no matter how you spin it, Repair Kits are not cosmetic by any means. I don't get the need to defend every Anti-Consumer decision by fanboys. Where does that loyality to let a company screw you and then turning around and begging for more come from?
---
that Bob Dylan nails it for me. Why do we get less than before yet things have a higher price? and in some cases (not just Bethesda) non functioning, still buggy and unpolished games are being sold at that higher price tag. smaller companies seemingly want to please their fans and fix broken content and expand with more and for...FREE since they paid for the game. seriously, without charging more money or having microtransactions (no man's sky, conan exiles to name two) and a company that realized we matter and wants to keep us happy will get my money.
---
I've been on the edge of my seat waiting on a new dragon age game but now, im worried it'll never happen (not quality anyway). same goes with the new elder scrolls. I see what they've done with fo76 and blades...and shake my head. 
---
I wonder if it's all about money for them or integrity at having happy customers or even integrity for their product (I'm looking at WoW here)...
---
I dunno if that's generational or not but we used to get a full whole complete game before...
---
and yet you need to pay real money. Pull your head out of your ass. the air's much cleaner and you won't be quite so full of shit if it can actually leave your body.
---
Some of them are very roughly in the same region.  Harpers Ferry is in the Eastern Panhandle, Point Pleasant is in the West, but Clarksburg is south of Morgantown irl. 
---
If enjoying slaying virtual nazis with over the top weaponry isnt something that makes you smile you may be a shitty human or a nazi which is just a specific kind of shitty human.
---
Mate of course. I wear full sent ass gear and die regularly as well. But fact is, being equiped with good legendary armor gives you an advantage over PA users.  Also, OP decided to be a dick in his response, so why should I describe the reasons in more detail.
---
I dont know why but I never need any 
---
Be warned - a number of players have said this mod simply doesn't work.
---
No loyalty needed.
---
The game is fun to play, just don’t buy the micros transactions.
---
I play adventure, it doesn’t matter what other people have, even if they end up selling power armour in the shop.
---
Get over it and just enjoy the game.
---
It has nothing to do with "generations" and has everything to do with gullibility and uncontrollable impulses. There are "whales" in every age group. 
---
Also for those asking about 'how many'.  As an anecdote, it took me 52 turn ins between receiving Paladin and receiving Elder.
---
I see the point but I use the durability is still so good I o my need to repair my things every other day or so which is more than enough time to get the stuff to repair without even actively looking for it.
---
Pro Tip: Equip Super Duper for the chance to craft an extra Syringer
---
A recent announcement let us know that weapon repair kits will soon be purchaseable from the Atom Shop, likely joined by the announced Refrigerators. The worst part about the fridges is the recent nerf to food decay rates, implying that the nerf was to push microtransactions.
---
I think it's bullshit to pay real money for intangible objects in an entertainment product I bought for a decent price. I want a finished product. A dlc with a large amount of stuff offered from the atom shop is okay. This is scummy bullshit and I will never spend money on it. What's next? Ads in games that aren't free to play? Yes. Eventually. 
---
That is dissapointing
---
It was $20 on Melee weapons. Was totally worth it. 
---
Supporting the economy.  
---
I know the Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum is much larger in real life, and the surrounding area is much different than the game version, but it’s still a really cool representation. The real life TALA is also north of Greenbrier, but south east of Greenbrier in the game, if I remember correctly.
---
Fishing would make a great addition to this game. 
---
Is this the spot in the middle of the map? People metioned it is somehow connected with player loading in to the server or something. Seemes to be only a visual thing.
---
If you knew that this is what I was going to do with it and you turned a blind eye to it....   Then you still share part of the blame.  
---
Given the track record of the countries that accept our garbage, it's pretty clear what happens.  Also, it's pretty clear that these waste disposal companies are not doing what they promise, which is to recycle as much as possible.  They are finding cheap ways to get rid of the problem to maximize profits.
---
Don't you think that we should be recycling and developing new ways of reducing what ends up in landfills?  I mean, shipping our problems overseas seems like a bit of a cop-out....  
---
I hope it's crazy hard solo able but doable if you are good enough. Unless there are mechanics that require 2 people like simultaneously pushing buttons
---
Well a few days ago the director went on record saying there are "millions of players" and the game sold "above expectations" lately. So it seems to have recovered by a good mile. They didn't say anything about how well the MTX are doing though. 
---
How?
---
I went to the Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum last year! Took the all access tour or whatever, with the top floor included. Was really cool and interesting. Going again in a few months to stay during the night.
---
How that bad?
---
I'm sure they'll end it with a No Man's Sky type push towards the end where later content really improves the game, just seems to be a trend where you spend 60 bucks on a game to then wait a year for an update to make it the game it should have been. 
---
Would be great if they finally split PvP to being 100% avoidable on adventure servers.
---
Ugh, people like you are why the industry is as rotten as it is. Thanks for ruining gaming for everyone else. 
---
Why remotely bother with it when Excavator gets you such a huge yield, and if you know of a few locations that spawn ore, you'll get way more in a few server hops than what'll you'll ever get at Mount Blair in a similar amount of time. Plus, Ignition cores aren't exactly the cheapest thing to craft 4 times every time you want to use the workshop. It's not underrated, and it's far more time consuming than literally just collecting ore yourself, especially with the effort of clearing enemies from such a massive workshop, installing the ignition cores, and then literally wait 30 minutes for it to make a complete cycle of random ore. I can get 400+ steal ore within 10 minutes, and with only 1 server hope. I can get even more lead ore than steal within 10-15 minutes and no hops (Lucky Hole Mine). Mount Blair is pennies in comparison.
---
Just give us their ign so we can send a hit squad.  PVP can go either way.
---
Nope. I fully expect them to fuck this up too. Not even gonna waste the bandwidth to 76 again
---
Reloot in what way?  My alts had racked up some TD on their own prior to doing Forbidden Knowledge, so I was working off a stack in their inventory.
---

But it's good to have another post so Bethesda could possibly see it if they haven't already
---
Wait a week then buy a repair kit.
---
Good luck littlescrub. Yeah, 1 every 20 seems to be the average. 
---
After finally getting a nice explosive combat shotgun, I want a skin just so I don’t have to worry about accidental drop/selling of it!  I’d prefer free states but I’d buy a BoS one if it was up there!
---
You're preaching to people who don't want to hear your opinion simply because it conflicts with theirs. I fully expect them to fuck this up colossally, just like everything else they have done in 76.
---
They should just give it to Zenimax Online and let them do a Tamriel Unlimited to it
---
I guess it’s a mystery! Oh well I put a kinetic servo on my other leg just Incase. 
---
It is.  It would be a lovely thing to try on the SBQ.  I like how the SBQ promotes some unconventional weapons,l like the Cryolator, and the Syringer would fit right in with that.
---
I figured that was the reason there's a ton of brain fungus around the dumpsters - they grow from corpses under certain conditions.
---
Incidentally, I've been surviving off brain fungus soup ever since I moved my camp/store onto the golf course.

I’m pretty sure the generational divide has to do with you being an adult working to make a living, and your son being too young to enter the workforce, and thinks that money is worth more than it really is (no real concept of bills and taxes). I’m sure we were all the same way at that age. 
---
That being said, I don’t have an issue with the Atom Shop as of yet. Repair kits, which from my understanding will only repair 50% of your weapon as opposed to a workbench, are not P2W. Just keep an eye on your weapon’s CND and utilize the workbenches atound the map, and you’ll most likely never need a repair kit anyway. 
---
Once the container is looted of techdata, there is a cooldown before loot respawns.  
---
 On my main thats around 48-72 hours. However my alt looted bunker desks, and they have still not respawned after 108 hours.  
---
But they don’t provide an advantage. They only provide a subpar convenience 
---
"plenty content"
---
The same handful of events,a nuke launch that is (contrary to what you'd believe) a painfully boring and linear grind, and whitespring golf club?
---
I fully expect it to be another nuke launch scenario. A boring waste of ammo with zero payoff
---
lol this isn't the greatest item to move. easier if they were something more  common like stimpacks. I'm not on xbox, but good luck.
---
Both, and robot.
---
Yup, agreed on all counts. 
---
Dude I am from '89. I understand the concept of pollution. I see everything that it does. I watch, read, and listen to to all those effects it has on the wildlife, you know getting caught or trapped in plastic and all that shit. However, and here is the kicker, I choose not to give a shit.  When you do not stress over shit you live much happier. All of you guys commenting here have got worked up over me (some random guy) on the internet. A guy a really does not care either way. Instead you all could of just shrugged it off as some person being a dick and went about the day. However you guys chose to let it affect you, when in no way does it matter or make a difference. I do truly enjoy this form of entertainment it is intriguing. 
---
I love the look of these type of stairs, but they mess up placing walls and stuff for me.  If anyone has pro tips on stair placing, I’d love to read them.
---
yes, it’ll load in just like it normally would when there’s no one on your spot
---
It will spawn if you try another world AND that world has your camp spot available to you.
---
They did a REALLY good on the green brier hotel!
---
And then, could you accept lootboxes if this were a Adult Only game?
---
I'm with you. Capitalism is a faulting system. I could like a Capitalism 2.0 (https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2008/0310/030.html) or a Communalism (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communalism?wprov=sfla1). But games are not a relevant problem in the big scenario, although software would be. The open source movement (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software?wprov=sfla1) is a move in the right direction, and it have games!
---
Games are not so important. And they're not priority in the set of things to change. Also, they are enjoyable just like that. Pay to win is a problem but this is not pay to win.
---

I did the full tour too. They've done some great restoration work in there.
---
You just moved the goal posts.
---
Let's face it. Even tactics is better than this shitshow
---
Having true planters (rectangular, square, round, etc.) and different sized Green Houses that you can use to make rooftop, basement, or cliffside gardens would be a great addition to the Atomic Store and I would happily pay about $10 to $15 for the plans/add-on.  
---
I like it.  Toys have lead, they do have little awareness jokes in items.
---
I do. 500 ea ok?
---
So if I find a spawn with a white con animal, that is a tamable one?  I found a white frog once out at the ummm animal torture raider camp.  Rarer than a rad storm to me.  Took a picture with it as it’s the only one I’ve seen in 600 hours.
---
that's exactly what I said if you would actually take the time to read the details -\_- 
---
So to summarize.. 
---
If I load into a World and then..
---
FIRST: Stay in the world and lose my camp
---
SECOND: Go to a new world, my camp will reappear if the spot is free
---
Right? Just want to make sure. It scares me, because I have SUCH a perfect layout that took days.
---
Or, you know, don't try and sell me a paint job for 18$, it's never going to happen.
---
I wish you could mod those to be usable level 50 weapons.  I'd love to protest the hell out of the SBQ.
---
You do very well... for being a Raider!
---
I agree. They shud have made them survive from they exit the vault 
---
It feels like some very old and clueless folks are making those corporate decisions. The artists are doing a good job but they can’t craft those skins without the go-ahead from their senile bosses. 
---
"help support the game"
---
Uhhh bethesda made a billion off skyrim
---
I think because we are older, we can see the marketing and business profits in games more obviously since we know what it looks like time and time again. But also back when we played games, they didn't have the intent on updating new items into a already existing game. We would just look forward to the entire series. But now that people can play games and they can 'update' or change overtime, we have to consider the people creating the content for us and how they will continue to make a living. Hence why us older gamers (I'm 29) don't like seeing a businessman came to our front door and try to sell us a ticket into a vault we've never seen before. Just my opinion. 
---
Sounds very Bethesda like. 
---
Don't they do something like that with ESO?
---
Even if they required people to build new characters for survival, your email would say the same thing in a few months when the maxed out players with great gear are more powerful than the new players starting. At least this way people can build up players in adventure to then compete in survival. 
---
I did read, it was a correction for the title.... calm down there bud.
---
Correct; your camp stays intact but unavailable if someone else has that camp spot. Once you're in a world with that spot free, you camp will spawn in as you last left it.
---
How did passersby feel about walking past a guy wearing a gas mask? 
---
No worries. You’ll be fine. C.A.M.P will spawn next time you log in. 
---
Yeah thats true
---
I'm on board with this.
---
If that was the case, then why did they buff durability of energy weapons instead of keeping it the same, but buffing their damage output?
---
I'm game, add me: Maneetoe
---
Awesome, thank you very much!
---
I’ve only destroyed a camp once because I wanted a large bounty so I could be hunted
---
Sweet - thank you! :D
---
I appreciate it!
---
That I'll have to check. My alt on my main account was getting better respawns on Daily quests and now it is in the same boat as the main.  I have not checked container spawns like TD and cap stashes.
---
  Nothing but Biv, Cop a Squatter, and Camden.

I hope it's like the silos.  Hard soloable but doable.

Although, since it's instanced i want a group finder.  With only 24 on a server at once, it would be nice to jump in with a random group then head back to your home server.
---
I get that there are different interpretations of P2W,  I do.  These microtransactions,  as proposed, cross the boundary from cosmetic only to giving players the ability to buy ingame materials/items (if not indirectly) with real world currency.  Call it what you want, but THATS the problem.
---
I drop Nukashine into the Overseers Stash in Flatwoods. It’s the little things. 
---
I live like 10 minutes away from point on the Ohio side, too bad you can’t you can’t visit Ohio!
---
Unless it’s a turret camp somewhere like whitesprings (that everyone will destroy on principle), there is absolutely no reason for it at all. Some people are just dicks unfortunately.
---
I like the idea of repair kits. Fighting the SBQ I've had guns break. I disagree with them being sold for real money though. I can see this becoming a real issue as the survival aspects evolve.
---
Jokes on you. You're only invisible on your screen.
---
That's tack af and I love it
---
ESO does this model so well. You get a ton of content with the base game. You can buy individual add ons if you like, or subscribe and always get DLC stuff, excluding the larger expansion chapters. Oh, and while you're subscribed, well give you our shop currency equal to the cost of a monthly subscription, too. 
---
I've dropped my sub, (RIP glorious craft bag) but I was still able to buy the DLC content I wanted to keep from the crowns I got through my subscription. 
---
I’m with u/SavoirFaire71! Take away the weapons too! This post-apocalyptic game has no need for violence!
---
It's a BETA. One reason they did this was so that everyone would bring over their maxed out characters and break shit. Survival right now is basically Bethesda's way of free beta testing for bugs and bad pvp combos that break the game.
---
Lol. Of course, this is already the case with chameleon about 40% of the time so that's about par for the course.
---
This is a new thread about the repair kits. You are doing exactly what you want others not to do.
---
&gt; The games released today have ten times the content of those released 15 years ago, and you are almost never forced to spend a penny more unless you want even more content beyond that.
---
Every freemium mobile game and current AAA game would like to have a word with you. Pay base cost of a game to get access to a service that gouges you for more money, all the while offering less content than ever before.
---
Time to wake up.
---
Those defend missions. I’ve taken it a couple of times. With a teammate it may be more viable. But it took me 30 minutes to defend against 2 waves of bloatflies. Just from trying to find them.
---
Better just stick to bloatflys.
---
Why does this sound like a defense for pay to win 
---
I do agree with you about keeping our trash at home. Build more recycling centers here, as well as incinerators to burn what can’t be recycled. We could even harness the energy from the incinerators as well.
---
It's, uh, lore-friendly. See, 'rebuilding Appalachia' is not just a slogan. You don't get to just build a base and settle. You have to keep rebuilding, forever, no matter what.
---
It’s safe to say that Fallout 1 probably cost pennies compared to Fallout 76. But I’m usually in your line of thinking when it comes to micro transactions and such.
---
Kinda hard to tell with all the power armor
---
Parenting: you're doing it right!
---
It's not just the President but I believe his cabinet and the Senate as well. IIRC there was a train (underground maybe?) that could get them from DC to the Greenbrier without having to be exposed to the nuclear fallout.
---
Wait, the lighthouse is real?   That’s the thing I was most sure was made up!  Even the in-game story is different and doesn’t have it up until 2036.  I just assumed they added it and put the date in the future to cover that.  
---
Very cool, thanks for sharing!
---
The DR and ER of armor matters little. It is the perks of the armor that really matters, and all armors can have the same perks. Get whichever you prefer.
---
Nope, you need to learn what that phrase means before you start tossing it around. What does the first sentence on wikipedia's page on first person shooters say?
---
\&gt;**First-person shooter** (**FPS**) is a [video game genre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_genre) centered around gun and other weapon-based combat in a [first-person perspective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_person_(video_games)); that is, the player experiences the action through the eyes of the [protagonist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protagonist).
---
Oh right... exactly the thing I was trying to get across to you.
---
You've never played any PS2 game then.
---
Bazaars thattaway my friend 👉
---
What platform?
---
They should. Callibrated shocks stack.
---
pc
---
I badly want some mods for that thing too!
---
Commenting again: I pay extra for other stuff all the time too. This isn’t a new concept. If there’s a podcast I like, I’ll pay more and get extra content for it. If I want to watch Game of Thrones,  I pay for HBO.
---
The only difference between these mediums are ads. There are no ads in these triple A online-only games, and if it needs to sustain itself long term, it has to have continuous cash flow. I already pay $60 a year for Xbox Live so thankfully I’m not paying for a subscription to Fallout 76 on top of that. Occasionally throwing $20 at a game I love isn’t that big a deal for me. 
---
Leave this subreddit then lol
---
Am I out of the loop?  Why is bethesda against disabled gamers?
---
What about Blizzard?  Paying to advance to level 60 in WoW.  I ask facetiously of course.  It's a stretch to say that would be "ablism".   Flexing the ADA so flippantly like this is going to dilute it's authority over time.  I wouldn't try honestly.   
---
I think that you're using your disabled status in order to issue a customer complaint under the guise of a human rights complaint.  It's not a golden ticket to get your way every time you're upset with the world.  You should probably go through proper channels for these kind of complaints instead of soap boxing with them in the future.  It comes across as very disingenuous.  
---
Do you have Discord?
---
The repair kits provide the advantage of repairing your weapon. 
---
yeah absolutely
---
where launch the bomb ?
---
Can you imagine the frame rate and crashing when 10 people summon them at the same time in whitesprings or watoga lol
---
What is the hunter's hood?
---
Nah. I made the mistake of buying it digitally, so as long as i'm stuck with this game in my library you're stuck with me reminding you all that it's a complete fucking shitshow
---
If there was a generational divide I'd expect it to go the other way; with the young people, who have no income, complaining about pay to win.
---
As it is, this is just different people having different opinions; as a 31-year-old, I'd be fine if they expanded the Atom Shop, so long as it didn't include overt pay to win nonsense like damage boosts or auto-revives.
---
Oh ok. So it doesn't define percentages like you did which in turn means minecraft is a fps no?
---
I want a princess bed and toys! tee hee..
---
I’m on Xbox, but there’s a great community on r/fo76FilthyCasuals. I’ve found some great people of all levels to play with. 
---
Yeah this forum is breaking due to it. You know what it needs? Repair kits.
---
My great grandfather hunted bear for a living and sold the Greenbrier resort the meat and fur
---
Wolfenstien didn’t piss me off at all or anything. I was just restating a common argument that I’ve heard online 
---
Sucks to suck
---
I'm guessing that with mid level luck that you will better results with awesome opossum bacon (Flatwoods for opossums, +2 Luck) or iguana soup (Hevetia for squirrels +3 Luck) combined with daytripper (+3 Luck) before submitting the technical data.
---
Did anyone question what you were doing with a gas mask? Cool pictures though.
---
I can't wait to do it in VR when Wolfenstein Cyberpilot comes out.
---
Must suck to keep telling yourself this game will get better and that bethesda care for more than anything but taking your money despite all the evidence to the contrary
---
Really sure these are for the upcoming dungeon events like when you're deep in the dungeon and you need to repair a weapon.
---
First of all, you're using a strawman, as I didn't mention a "long history" of anything regarding Bethesda.  That said, regarding FO76, there are multiple times Bethesda has lied/been misleading or just generally been sketchy in their behavior:
---
1.  Stating that only cosmetic items would be sold in the Atom Store.
---
2.  Stating that FO76 would have 16 times the detail rendered compared to previous games.
---
3.  Trying to switch out plastic bags for the canvas ones advertised and the Nuka Rum bottle issues.
---
4.  Refusing to refund people that downloaded the game.
---
This doesn't even touch on the fact that the state of the game at launch was so far away from what a AAA game should be, which really is the biggest thing.  It also doesn't get into their slow response to issues like duping or patches that bring back previous problems.  There may be other issues I'm forgetting but this is off the top of my head.
---
For me, Bethesda has lost any benefit of the doubt.  I will certainly not be purchasing any of their games at release.  The gaming community has a short memory, so in the long run this may not make any difference in their profits, but I can tell you that their actions regarding this game will affect my decisions regarding their games in the future.
---
And this sub has a trading flair. I can post here because of that, thanks though!
---
The bounty stays until killed. That being said, the bounty system needs some work. I had a 200 cap bounty in survival mode. I was done playing and logged off. The next day when I logged on in adventure mode I still had the bounty. Lots of non PvP players tried to collect and I made a fortune defending myself. I also wonder if when I got killed if the person actually collected and if the person that pit the bounty on actually paid.
---
I’m on PC but use an Xbox controller, but if you select something and press Y (unknown what the keyboard keybind is) you can choose what to swap with. 
---
They don't contain nuclear material. They have wood, a screw, and lead. The lead is from the paint.
---
If I remember correctly, at Pax Todd Howard said that they were entertaining the idea of making survival season based, meaning that a new character would need to be created at the beginning of each season (or he may have said that your current character would have their survival level reset, one or the other).
---
I live near the 'Eastern Regional Penitentiary' which is the in game version of the moundsville penitentiary. I have to say I was a tad bit disappointed with bethesda on that end. In game, the penitentiary sits kind of isolated, while irl its surrounded by a huge town. Also there is a lot of lore surrounding the penitentiary that I think could have made for some very cool in game enemies and events. Supposedly the penitentiary is haunted, so it would have been cool to see something of a nod towards that, instead of it just being a super mutie camp.
---
Think about it. 
---
They don't have tattoos asides from the meh vanilla 5 face tattoos from FO4 available. We've already seen those. For years. There are some seriously cool tattoos via FO4's modding scene. Let's see some of *those*. 
---
Look at the number of hair styles and colors available via mods - hundreds of hair styles and several dozen hair colors the last I bothered to eyeball the numbers. 
---
Polls would let them gather at least some idea of what people would like quickly and concisely. It's far more efficient as compared to having their staff/interns comb through Reddit, Twitter, etc etc for hours. 
---
What are they considering making available on the shop but haven't committed to just yet? Fire up that survey monkey and poll away. 
---
Great idea buddy, would be an awesome addition to the game.
---
I'm 20 and somewhat split on the shop. I don't like the idea of having microtransactions in a game I already paid full price for, especially with the rates that some of the stuff earlier on had (almost $20 for a single skin...), but I can also recognize that $60 is not what it was worth 20 years ago, especially with so much more work being put into making video games than it was back then. This is also a bit of a special case since all the DLC and content updates is free, and is being "funded" by the community via the atom shop. I'd personally prefer to not have any microtransactions and choose whether I want to pay for certain DLC packs, but that's just me
---
Other than the general idea of it, I don't mind it that much. I think it's pretty fair that this game lets you earn atoms every week just for simple tasks, some of which you will accomplish naturally without ever checking the challenges screen. I have everything I want from the shop at the moment and never paid a cent for it. Compare that to something like black ops 4 where some weapon camos, weapon variants, and character cosmetics (that in previous games you could at least get through randomized supply drops) are locked EXCLUSIVELY to cod points. The cheapest of these are $3, and the most expensive sets go up as high as $30. The st. patrick's day "event" gave you a free calling card and emote, then had you pay $20 if you wanted the actual content stream. That was just insulting. And that is a game where you DO pay for the DLC, so many people spent $100 on that game (or $200 for the special edition) instead of $60
---
I guess in all fairness I'd prefer it to not be there, but I'm fine with it because others are doing worse. That's not a good state of the world, but so be it. It is pretty scummy that apparently it might not be cosmetic only though at some point, not really because a couple hundred atoms for plans are a big deal to me, but because they promised in the past it would stay only cosmetic
---
Sounds like the player somehow intentionally ripped you off. 
---
That is neat. Did not realize the Asylum was a real location.
---
Do you happen to know where the heck can I get calibrated shocks mod for the t-60 armor?
---
That's not a thing
---
From me if you’re on ps4 :)
---
The utility advantage of a repair kit over a game mechanic isn’t exactly the same as an advantage over other players, this would be.
---
Is that... really how you want to approach this discussion?
---
I guess I'll stay on the hook...
---
The point I was trying to get across to you is that fighting is nearly 0% of minecrafts core gameplay loop and most players can and do play without any fighting or shooting elements whatsoever. It is impossible to progress in any other style in FO76 as that is nearly 100% of the gameplay loop of FO76. So based on the definition that for the purposes of this discussion I've told you I'm working from, it's pretty easy to see that my classification of gameplay between minecraft and FO76 are consistent.
---
Now that we can hopefully move beyond that, do you have a real point for debate or would you like to continue being disingenuous?
---
alright, my gt is inhaledadvocado
---
Yep. There shouldn't be crossover. 
---
Lots of players still have maxed out weapons and outfits from the dooping days. 
---
&gt; Games used to be around $50- $40.
---
[Interesting](http://vgtribune.com/VGTribune/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Game-catalog-600x732.jpg).
---
While prices are in CAD, I definitely remember paying $60 for a bunch of SNES games in the US.
---
A full set of Sentinal assassins armor will make you take 115% less damage from other players. Tack on the blocker perk and now you are taking 45% less damage from melee attacks. Now your bloodied knife is doing 160% less damage not including the ballistic resistance, armor mods, and other damage resistance perks. Thats how I do it anyway....
---
Tbf the desert ranger armor came from pre-war riot gear I believe. A non-NCR variant could be in the game and sell quite well, however they might be withholding out of respect for the lore.
---
Paying to give yourself an advantage against other players because you’re naturally bad at the game is just sad man 
---

---
No problem!
---
Please 
---
What system are you playing on?
---
IMO, Survival Mode will need a matchmaker system so that players of similar levels are placed in the same world.
---
If such a level-matching system were implemented,how many tiers would this community like to see with which levels within each tier?
---
I think it should extend a couple of tiers past 50 because the depth and scope of a player's perk card deck is as much a factor in competitive matching as their weapons and armor.
---
You sound like a horrible friend, unless they offered to pay
---
I would like to see this just to make it worthwhile to even loot their corpses. Especially the Mirelurk Kings. They are just a waste of bullets and stimpacks and all you get is some Mirelurk meat.

That would be RAD. 😏😏😏
---
I'm pretty sure Site Charlie/Alpha/Brave has technical data, but it might be random not fixed. Either way there is a high chance they spawn there 
---
Who is being a dick? You are telling me that you only can use certian items in PVP, because everything else sucks. Well in that case PVP sucks. It's just plain stupid to have only specific items that have a chance in PvP. So you are basically telling that most of my stuff is worthless in PvP and in that case i say that PvP is worthless. I don't want to get a list from the internet and grind these specific items, just to enjoy the game. Well when I don't find these items, i still can trade and even can try out real money trades and hoping not getting scammed, just to play everything in the game. 
---
They absolutely do! Adding, with the caveat that its pain in the backside to farm :)
---
I’m actually planning a trip the last week in May and I’m curious how the weather will be. I’m 8 hours north of WV and it’s usually pretty nice during the days. Any places you would consider must visit?
---
And sell them for reasonable prices. I would have bought most of the stuff that has been in the store if the prices weren't absolutely a****** insane. 
---
Just picked up 5000 atoms so it's not like I'm not willing to pay.
---
Power armor reduces your radiation and fire resistance?
---
It’s probably not great for farming but I always come out of a silo with some technical data, the final area is full of file cabinets and has always provided.

What about the aesthetics of the old fallouts that fallout 3 captured so well? People want to play fallout because they like fallout. Fallout 76 takes the traditional dark humor of the Fallout series and puts a cartoonish “whimsical and fun” spin on it. Yes Man was a great character, but the popularity of his cheerfulness does not mean that we want our in game expression (cosmetics) to reflect the same. Some of us love Fallout for those dark undertones. 
---
Wasn’t saying you can’t post here, just pointing out there is a specific place for trading. Glad I could help! 
---
I have no idea, but the fact that the player took off and now won't reply pretty much says it all. 
---
Which Power Plant?
---
I've done them all many times for plans and for fusion cores.  But each one has a bit different layout.  
---
In general, you repair the pipes, the pumps, and the reactor until all three bars are considered repaired with the option, but not requirement, to completely repair each item.  You then go into the control room and power up the plant from the control computer.
---
It's always best to turn off all other quests when doing the power plants until you get familiar with the layouts.  The other quests will introduce the marker for the exit doors.

yup, thanks, added

Clearly you don't or you'd realize it's in everyones best interest to not pollute. You choose not to give a shit because the problem of littering and pollution is small compared to what it could have been, if everyone acted like you we'd all be fucking miserable all the time. You understand society is like an organism right? All areas feed into eachother, if there's too much trash we have to spend money we'd otherwise spend on education, healthcare etc on cleaning that up. It's all part of a fragile balance and you throwing water bottles on the ground just tells me you're worth less than the trash you choose to throw on the ground as far as society is concerned.   
---
Society has already paid for your upbringing and your education, pay it back by not being a selfish prick.  
---
\&gt; When you do not stress over shit you live much happier.    
---
Life is not about making yourself the maximum happy. It's about making everyone the maximum happy, and doing so sustainably. Why should we nurture a few people for a short time and then all die/use up all the resources on earth when we can nurture all people basically forever? We could without people like you. You ofc don't see this logic because you want to be one of the nurtured ones, if you were one of the people cleaning up the trash you throw on the ground I'm sure you'd have a different opinion.  
---
You think you're a genius because you cracked the code that if you don't care you can be happy, but you're dragging 10 people down with you who have to clean up your mess, hence you are nothing more than a drag on society. You're apparently smart enough to realize attitude matters, but dumb enough to not realize what really matters in life, a very interesting combination. You must be exactly at the top of the bell curve.  
---
You say you understand the concept of pollution but clearly you don't have a fucking clue how it affects other things than its immediate environment. It's all interwoven, hope you can see the big picture some day and rise above that bell curve.
---
WTF is wrong with your graphics?
---
It's a bug pretty sure, dude was buying a piece of armor from me, he spent the caps and we parted (stayed on the server though) and 5 minutes later he asked if I still had it, still did so I gave it to him even though he paid the caps but he never got it
---
Any animal is tameable if you have animal friend lv3 and find the animal in a random spawn location by its self. But if you have both wasteland whisper and animal friend both lv3 you can tame a snalkygaster. I'm making a map with all known random spawn locations that the community and myself have been working on.
---
If it was me and I only wanted caps for them I would just keep 50 or so on me at all times and just offer them up for 100 caps each
---
Sure
---
So when you got the paints, you were turning in just one piece? Somewhere I got the idea that more pieces increases reward chances, but I don't actually have confirmation
---
Well you also need to factor in a couple other things for your scenario.
---
Most children that young aren't yet able to handle concepts like money, value and saving very well. There are occasionally exceptions, but he's a child...
---
Second, while the game might have been $60 for you, for your kid, it was free. It's very unlikely for him to have any prior investment into it like you do.
---
It doesn’t take a new account to make an alt, honey
---
Thanks again!
---
It happens once in a while.  It's a bug but one that's easy to fix.  Just kill the eyebot and the one that replaces it shouldn't be hostile.  I've done it a few times and it always worked.
---
If they are not taking damage while standing still they have sentinel armor. Make them move. If they aren't taking damage while running it is cavalier armor. Make them stop. Everything has weaknesses. Exploit them. There is no perfect armor that makes you invincible.
---
And Thank You!!
---
I don’t think quoting Dylan, as appropriate as it may have been, will lessen the gap between the generations. :p
---
People think having a billions of dollars industry is great. I disagree. All it means is that game companies are basking in the glow of finding new ways to milk people for shit that would have been in-game years ago, and OP’s comment about the generational divide is the proof. Preorders, deluxe editions, season passes, cash shops, loot boxes, all that shit has been normalized.
---
Do I buy into most of that? No. But resources that would have been assigned to just make a better game are now devoted to finding ways to make people spend more, so I just get a shittier game as a result.
---
Sometimes I honestly think about quitting gaming as a protest, because playing means I’m complicit with this bullshit.
---
Everybody who agrees with me is a smart adult and everybody who disagrees is just a silly kid.
---
You are bitching around, because i attacked a game that you love. You are basically telling that i should throw all my items away and just get what everyone else has, to have a chance to play. You are worshipping a still broken beta mode. I'm telling my oppinion on that mode, how it's not fair in my eyes. It's not a ducking esports game, where i should have the best game knowledge to be able to play.   
---
You know, Bethesda just could balance the game, so everyone can have fun with their gear and game knowledge and not only 10% of the game.   
---

---
They have no idea how much effort goes into making a world with this much detail. 
---

---
With repair kits, you don’t need to use perk points on durability perks like luck of the draw or gunsmith. This could potentially give you 8 more special points to use, as you wouldn’t need the 5 points in intelligence or the 3 points in luck.
---
Just use ghoulish cuz you not only heal from rads but it negates slot of the rads you take 
---
I don’t mean to come off as rude, but they are going to do what they want because it is their game.
---
If you don’t like what they are doing, then play another game instead.
---
You are on their to have fun, so either have fun or play something else is all I am trying to say.
---
I get it the non-cosmetic shit is annoying but will it *really* impact how YOU play?
---
Maybe they thought this would slide under the radar due to the current Epic hate monopolising the gaming headlines.  Bethesda absolutely knows that this will go down like a lead balloon with FO76 players, so they obviously don't care.
---
Jesus yes. I just had to recraft 3000 ammo after doing the queen.
---
Space Space Space Space....

see jimquisition Turning Players into Payers for a long form explanation of how they are doing this - they are using big data to add revenue to their own bottom line whilst adding no value into the player's total experience. Instead of using the data to make their product LEGITIMATELY better, they are using the information the bots stalking everyone gathered to simply learn how and when they can place a transaction for money with the littlest amount of value. 
---
This is the corporate welfare equivalent of figuring out how to not work at your job so your boss won't notice and you complete your hours for the same pay but with littler cost to yourself. It's the definition of slacking off.
---
All of these corporations need player coalitions to advise their community to dev relations employees so they can realize that we WILL NOT ACCEPT THIS KIND OF GARBAGE BEHAVIOR quietly. We will loudly call them out on it, because we would like them all to stop ruining the games and properties we love by transforming them into soulless slot machine like abominations that simply do not offer a quality experience.
---
They could actually use the data to fix gaps where players expect to find value or want to find it and do not, so that the experience is amazing and players are paying and playing because they having FUN IN A VIDEO GAME and all their friends are there for it thanks to the quality and the multiplayer enjoyment. 
---
That can't happen if the only thing they use the big data for is to hollow out everything and just get more revenue without actually developing gameplay that constitutes value to the players.
---
It's almost as if a 37-year-old should be fiscally more responsible than an eight-year-old. Who would've thought?
---
This **is** true, but as we've already mentioned, the MG-42 doesn't even use 7.62 at all, so we're just taking creative liberties here lol
---
It was topside, there's a 45min documentary on YouTube 
---
Weapon skins would rake in money. It’s so obvious to me, and yet, Bethesda has only released a small few so far. I don’t know how they don’t see the opportunity there 
---
Can we also harvest lead from the water? 
---
Haha you mean they look shit? I have to run the game in potato mode because it runs so bad
---
Yeah that's why I'm hoping for more cool Apocalypse style pieces.
---
no problem and thanks anyway, I guess? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
---
I thoroughly despise any sort of  monetization of "loot boxes", "chests", "crates" or "cards" which are various forms of gambling.
---
Religion, Capitalism, and our current government (Citizen's United) are a terrible combination of tools and circumstances enabling corruption and the furthering of wealth inequality and other harms to society and the environment fueled by the psychotic greed of the wealthy elites and global megacorporations.
---
Exactly, what happened to the Japanese and did all the weird stuff survive the bombs .
---
Having to run a game that bad is honestly worse than losing a loved one. My sympathies.
---
I don't disagree either.
---
But eventually they will have to face the fact that they aren't doing game development when the entirety of the experience is made so that they can have money transactions in the mechanics instead of where it belongs, at the beginning of installing a finished product containing real value to real gamers.
---
And you keep to their initial ‘keeping transactions not P2W’

Comparison of the Greenbrier to The Whitespring.
---
They made up the name from White Sulfur Springs, where the Greenbrier is located. 
---
They brought the perk in line with others and then buffed heavy weapon durability
---
I don’t think the generation divide thing is fair - I’m 36, been gaming my whole life and played every fallout game and I don’t really care about the atom shop or anything they choose to put into it. I’ve been playing the game since beta, I’ve more than got my money’s worth out of it. If things get bad (and in my opinion they aren’t there yet) then I can just walk away and play another game. 
---
Yup. But the ammo is classified as ballistic and the weight is reduced by bandolier. Someone figure that one out
---
That's pretty cool. The only thing I'm near in the game is Camden Park. It's about 3 minutes down the road from me. 
---
I saw one at Harpers ferry earlier. I would guess there or Watoga. I’d try Watoga first since all I could find there was t60 mods when I was looking for 51b. 
---
The good luck is much appreciated. Wouldn't mind but I'm solo so the mutation wouldn't even benefit me lol. I feel this is a curse as well as a gift haha. 
---
Depending what console your on I can get you one
---
I mean a few people said it was cosmetics only. Bioware has its own plethora of problems though. People like to blame EA for all their woes but it really sounds like BIoware was very much at fault for the fiasco that has been Anthem

---
dirty water is free and so is the ghoulish card. enjoy.
---
Ehh, much of it is a bunch of whining and overreacting, not real critique or stating a case. Not saying that people shouldn't voice their  opinion, but if I'm a dev I'd ignore temper tantrum responses. Messages about "omg Bethesda lied, how dare they do anything that isn't what I want, and why are they trying to profit?!" Would convince me of much. Too much slippery slope.
---
BOS vendor in Watoga sells all of the T-60 mods
---
i really don't know how this all works tbh. I assumed stuff like monetization was a corporate matter. 
---
15k for the lot lol. There is way more to be made, I just really haven't the time. I'm a dad, I work and just don't have the patience for all these serums, regardless how good or bad they are haha. Help. 
---
Comment number 3. This is Fallout, even the default walls and appliances are too clean for me. I personally wish I could build something more... Megaton like

Take this Mega Sloths advice for less point usage. 
---
Also, if you're on a team in general, especially in a nuke zone though, have a teammate or yourself share a 1* RadSponge perk (charisma) and you'll never ever use a radaway again, so long as you're on a team that is. 
---
I am closing in on 40 years old in a month.  I too come from a time where there was no such thing as microtransactions. Most mmo's I played though had a monthly subscription.
---
 I see the Atom shop is a way to help pay for future costs of the game which I completely understand.
---
 That being said I would never actually spend real money on any of that stuff. I also don't go out of my way to get more Atom's in game.
---
 I've only bought a few items for my camp from ingame atoms and claimed a bunch of stuff that they had on their for free.
---
 I'm glad others like to spend their real money on it to help the game.  In my opinion I just don't think anything is worth spending real money on.
---
That's awesome! 
---
I took a workshop in survival, and two lvl 200 characters tracked down my camp, destroyed it, *and then sent a picture of them standing in front of my wrecked camp via Playstation messaging* to lure me out of the workshop long enough to iniate a claim. 
---
Then when I went back it was "crackle crackle respawn" the second they found me.
---
Survival would have been a great opportunity to reset the broken duped economy.  I just hope they are gathering data about balance. 
---
The last thing anyone wants is another GTA Online. Sure its fun for a while, but when the curtain gets pulled back on the old man you see it for what it is, a big social experiment designed to frustrate and strong-arm honest grinding players into buying shark cards and skipping the entire (boring) gameplay loop.
---
Get rid of the lock picking except when picking locks. Also, get some mutations like eagle eyes. I run a stealth sniper build and do very well with it. 
---
According to the data files you get higher chances for better rewards from turning in 2 data at a time versus 1. At 2 tech data you will always get an aid item as well as higher caps and xp. Not sure how it effects the other drops but I expect in a similar way. The item in your inventory can stack but does not show with a number. Each paint can be obtained more than once provided you don't learn it the first time.
---
It’s not the easiest to get but I have one for sale on xbox if your first offer doesn’t work
---
I’m guessing you didn’t find any MODUS computers 
---
Ah dam I'm on ps4 
---
dont't worry man ! we are all gessing here :)
---
Thats one of the downsides of online gaming, get used to it.
---
wouldnt it be cool if they actually read the thoughts and ideas of those of us who have spent time testing and learning the bugs and missing feature completeness, written up very extensive feedback to respond to Inside the Vault...
---
instead of making up fake suggestions like this?
---
it would be so cool if they actually heard the players that are doing legitimate feedback here.
---
That explains why I see some lvl 3-5 in the Mire or at the Bog lmao. Nice, and evil.
---
Thats cool. What is your price?
---
I'm 31 and have been gaming my entire life. I'm going to be referring to paid games only here as a F2P game is a totally different animal. I have absolutely no issue with the atom shop and microtransactions in general AS LONG AS you're not hitting a pay wall or gaining significant advantage over other players by paying. As far as I'm concerned repair packs are not significant. I'm fine with it. Jesus if you want to see what a pay wall is go play an EA sports game on ultimate team mode and you'll see the difference. They are building this game to last. There are no expansions to pay for, all future content is free. Sales slow down and they need to generate revenue to continue to develop this game. 
---
I've played subscription based games where you pay for the expansions AND pay a monthly fee. I'd much rather some other player spend their money on power armor skins than have to pay a monthly fee or pay for an expansion. The fact of the matter is if they took out microtransactions and charged for expansions or monthly fees to make this game last long term people would still be complaining. 
---
There is no generational divide, just people that don't realise that gaming has morphed to people expecting games to last longer and be updated with more free content. Long gone are the days where a developer makes a game and just hosts servers and does some patching here and there until the game dies out. 
---
Think of it as launchers vs non-launchers. 
---
Fat Man, Missile Launcher, M79, Auto GL, Broadsider.
---
That leaves Minigun, Harpoon, LMG, 50 cal, Gatling Laser, Gatling Plasma, Flamer, Cryolator as the true heavy guns. Forgive me if I forgot any
---
Make me a good offer
---
It’s understandable with everyone that just uses a TSE and gets the jump, but you can punish the people who spent time to make their build capable of a one shot. 
---
For example instigating sniper combined with the sneak and rifle perks could be over could be over 1k damage. For the first hit. Unless your rocking sent/assassins that’s a kill.
---
Lol thats my luck dude.
---
Slap a Vault Tec University logo on a anime school girl outfit and I’d buy that in a heat beat
---
Iv just out the game back on to see what power plant it was and the mission markers hav all disappeared
---
The Fallout world stuck with paper bags and glass bottles, and was stopping the use of fossile fuels.  So aside from the nuclear waste and destruction, they were very green.
---
That's just a new kid cameo.
---
In Australia 1 power armor skin will cost you just under 30 dollars. The game as it is would be lucky to be worth twice that.
---
There is so much wrong with this. Millenial btw.
---

---
The hidden door is quite real BTW, as is the service entrance most of you lot use.
---
Has a sign saying "DANGER: HIGH VOLTAGE" to keep nosy communists out ;-) 
---
How do you know it has 4 floors? Also the entrance is in harpers ferry. It will be manholes on the ground as an entrance and an exit
---
I tried for 4 hours last night to use that type of stairs in my build with a doorway at the top. Every time I placed a floor down on the stairs. The Damm doorway would flip inside out. Aka if using  brick or metal you saw either white stuco or the joists that are supposed to be the inside. I finally gave up and just moved my camp  to another location and got a better build for my troubles today. Glad I did move server hopping 30+ times to find a world that can place my camp is stupid. We will see later if I have to move again. Hope not
---
I kind of love this idea. Time-limit "bed" use to like 30 seconds or a minute, and then it goes blurry and you take like 1hp of damage from accidentally clocking yourself with it.
---
That’s what you would think but there are multiple posts saying the only power armor leg mods that that stack are calibrated shocks. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Something that stood out to me, when I watched No Clip’s YouTube documentary on fallout, they said the first thing they do is start with a map and work outwards from there
---
Y'all realize its fallout. It's a post nuclear game and there's going to be plastic all over the fucking place. Not to mention the nuclear radiation. This is irrelevant. 
---
There's a visual object layering across the distance technique, for which there is a professional name that's beyond my competences, that is state of the art. Its responsible for mid/long distance details. The calculations I believe are done in a hybrid way too, but I won't guarantee that to you. This is not a polished game, I can agree with that, but its scope and scale is magnificent.
---
I said bullshit under comment that said bullshit. You responded constructively. I value that much. Tell me, do you do PvP? May seem unrelated but I'll present some point accordingly to answer for that question.
---
My entire survival build is centered on one shot kills as a sniper. Anytime I don't get that, I get killed.
---
Thank you. 
---
THANK YOU
---
There is already one shot protection. My black powder pistol can deal up to 1,800 damage with a sneak attack, head shot, and critical hit. It only takes about 75% off any player’s health. It did not matter if you are a level six hiding in a shack or a TSE sentinel user. If you have full life, you survive.
---
You are likely dying to high damage high fire rate weapons and mistakenly thinking a single bullet killed you. Either that or you are fighting at less than 80% total health which puts you at that maximum damage threshold.
---
Are you online now? If so is this your GT?
---
I’m on but what’s your offer?
---
I think it is bugged. Mine appears to be stuck on "get the robot wait staff back to work (5/5)"
---
They all went back to work. After a bunch of running around and collecting over 30 placesettings and seven centerpieces, I happened to notice that one of the wait staff out in the field, Elwood, doesn't have an interact action but has a transfer action. Makes me wonder if I'm supposed to deposit all of the table settings to Elwood, but i can't and there's no explanation. Elwood was damaged, so first I repaired them for two steel, but can't do anything else.
---
Go to lady Janet’s soft serve, run down the road to the overturned bus, a random encounter spawns there, if it’s not the bot just relog. Takes like 30 seconds and I found him 3 times in a 1 1/2 hour period of doing this the other night. 
---
Super unbalanced idea. What would even be the point of high damage low RoF weapons anymore?
---
No other competitive game does this. You have to get into the weeds in order to be competitive. For example, when I started playing PVP on Pokémon, I spent hours studying IVs, EVs, hidden abilities, item boosts, etc. That’s how PVP is.
---

Very cool op!
---
They do once you've done basic repairs sometimes.  Not always, but often. Leaving and re-entering fixes it usually
---
So instead of complaining about being one shot people will complain that they cant react fast enough to get the kills? Their first shot does 50% of your health while the follow up will be free to kill at full damage, all while your first shot does 50% of their health. So they already have the drop on you and if they are invisible the chances of you finding them and getting 2 shots in before they get their second are slim to none. 
---
Moral is I dont think this will work. Accept the loss, invest in high tier armor with dense and better weapons to be effective but understand that the game is first and foremost a PVE game which is why AA weapons are so effective and this is how it should be. If they took away the effectiveness of the perks on the weapons then PVE (which is why most people play this game) would be far less fun. Nobody is invincible in this game.

The Weat Virginia tourism board released an interactive map featuring places in the game

Just found out about this earlier today.  Also misogyny (making fun of a big girl in a skirt in a creeper video), hipocrisy (bashing drug culture literally while drinking and smoking, along with bashing porn porn fans as pitiful even though he has nude and slave girl mods loaded in a Fallout video), and copyright flags/takedowns for anyone that documented his behavior.  A youtube search of "oxhorn exposed" (I did this as a joke when I saw JuiceHead's recent 'youtuber exposed' bit) or "oxhorn controversy" (I did this after seeing the results of the previous search) was enough for me to unsub from Oxhorn, scrub him from my history, and tell Youtube I was no longer interested in Oxhorn suggestions.
---
What if your not naturally bad at the game? Maybe they dont have as much time on there hands to build the Atoms to get the cool gear or items. Or they just want to have the extra items for just because.   
---
I don't think I am bad at the game. I just think if I have the extra cash. Sure I will buy the fridge or buy tokens to help my weapon or armor be better. I will spend cash for atoms to have these items sooner than later.   
---
I imagine there are plenty of people who cannot put in as much time as others to build the atoms to get the cool looking items. Does not mean they are naturally bad.  
---
Also on a personal note. Thanks for the reply.  
---
Usually it's retaliation in my experience.  
---
A trader where you could always sell your “fresh” meat and fruit/vegetables would be really cool and would fit right in with a vault opening but not wanting to leave, but wanting fresh food! 
---
I dont know what it even goes for to be honest. What would seem far to you? I only have about 1500 caps right now but I also have some nice 3 star weapons if you are interested in trading for it.
---
Welcome to the thunder dome bitches!
---
The covert operative perk cards do this.
---
Is that the strength of your argument? I mean I'm willing to discuss this to explain mine.   
---
People will imagine the worst in a void, and when you provide them information like putting repair kits into the atomic store, they are absolutely going to imagine the worst case scenarios.   
---
We aren't talking about mobile. And the AAA games I play have 10 times the content and playtime hours as the same genre 15 years ago. Fact.

This outfit costs just over 750 from the Vendorbot as I recall, found one a week or so ago. They used to sell for 2-3k but I’ll sell you the one I found for 1.5k if you don’t find one before Sunday night. I’m out of town until then. 
---
A couple names here look familiar. No I have the answers to some questions. LOL
---
How do you now it's a tse though? 
---
I am kinda thinking the same. Kinda odd though that the loading stage for the map would be there.
---
I’m pretty sure the coat was 800 or something caps off the vendor so that’s gonna be a big chunk of what you have!
---
One of the reasons for this is moving the camp box after it is originally placed.
---
Well there you go, optimized suicide.

---
I collect these when I find them and have around 60 I think. What are they worth? 
---
Something like that. I think some legendaries might be okay and won't affect PvP that much. PvP shouldn't be affected by level or something and more of your skill and playstyle. It shouldn't matter if you are Level 10 or 100. A Level 100 can have a wider range of weapons to choose from but still shouldn't play a big role.   
---
A bolt action rifle like the hunting rifle has the benefits of higher range and higher damage (in theorie) and downside is the low firerate and the clip size and also the damage dropoff on range. A 10mm pistole can have higher firerate, when modded to an automatic but has lower damage. So both weapons can be kinda equal, depending on the playstyle and skill. 
---
PvP should be somewhat equal, to make fun for everybody. It makes no sense to have a mode in a game, that only players with somewhat perfect builds can have fun. Its not like that i ignore legendarys but most of the stuff i got has stupid stats. Also legendary mobs are kinda rare. Over the whole map i rarely see legendary mobs but in whitesprings i get attacked by 3 at the same time. With PvE this is no problem but with PvP it'S a big deal.   
---
They gotta give us a bank.

Nothing to most people. Most just drop them.

quad faster fr lever action level 35

Just the name of the game,  could've been your side tho. Work on getting stronger I'd say because nuke silos should only take about 15 mins .

That's not a problem. I try to keep around 4-5000 but I just bought a bunch of plans last night.

Are the non-legendary mods on it random?

Honestly... Having it consume AP like that apparently does in order to fire *(I've never played pre-FO3, despite owning the Mini Nuke Anthology)*. Would balance stuff out that's for sure. As someone who doesn't use VATs or even AP that often, I think 5 per shot would be a bit much, so maybe 2-3/per shot? 
---
The damage there sounds viable for this at 60-80, but upwards of 100 may not be out of the question on account of this would have to be a super rare end-game type of item. I'd also envision a fire-rate on par with the actual Gatling Gun (so it wouldn't be a "minigun" like in Tactics) or the 3x "Sniper-Barrel" Gatling Laser, which I think are called Charging Barrel. Either way, that would allow for a brief capacitor charging prior to each shot.
---
Alright I have to stop... it's making me sad that this isn't in the game and I can't go mow down Scortchbeasts with it \*tear\* lol
---
The half an hour is an exaggeration 
---
Because that's how they want to play the game.  It's not better, worse, right, or wrong than anyone else's.
---
If you don't want this in a game, don't play games that have it.
---
That was an estimate, shitlord 
---
Me also, level 80 sniper, ign GhostRider
---
Yeah I know the feeling. I was extremely disappointed as a fan of his content but at the same time not really surprised. I noticed as his channel got bigger his ego seemed to get a bit inflated. It seemed like he was struggling with this nice guy persona on live stream. 
---
Within your first sentence you have proved yourself wrong. Majority of the prepared PvPers fight in survival on characters between level 55 and 70. The so called nolifes ceased gaining experience in January because it gave them nothing. You choose the hard way by starting fresh and you can't accept the consequences of your decisions. Suck it up  You can easily play for hours on survival alone if you play it smart, but no let's keep spawning on a contested station. You refuse to play it smart and expect that people works is taken away because you are lazy. My friend started new character for survival to, he's already level 50+ and he's successfully hunting people with low quality armor and crafted combat rifle, but he's just playing it smart. Taking away people work would not make your situation better. You are a prey and you would be if we started fresh, if you can't freely exp in survival right now, there's no denying your role in the food chain.
---
Good deal. I'll keep you in mind. Appreciate it.
---
Deathclaws can not get up to the two sennaca rock peaks if that’s what you are wondering. I have a base there and tried. 
---
Perks ? Depends on they type of gun . Legendary effects , probably bloodied explosive.
---
I have a full.set of sentinel assassin's armor. It's great until you have to walk. Then you get killed. I now use an unyielding set and hide. Lol
---
Been a pretty bad game all along, but if they can pre-announce 6 months in advance what hats they are selling in a 100 day roadmap they certainly have someone thinking ahead enough to say "january: nerf repair, april: make repairs cost money" knowing they will catch the world's dumbest man here who has goldfish memory and can't imagine the two things can be connected because more than a week separates them. 
---
Salt.
---
I accidentally posted it as another comment. Whats fair to you? Ive only got about 1500 right but some 3 star weapons for trade also.
---
&gt;You are telling me that you only can use certian items in PVP, because everything else sucks. Well in that case PVP sucks. 
---
It's worse than that: he's telling you that you can only use RNG dependent items in survival or items that you buy on ebay. 
---
Well yeah, I just got a whitespring run robbed from me. Now fuck off.
---
hi dude,
---
i'm interested how much stars have the gauntlet?
---
thanks
---
I'm pretty confident that they are making money off of people with disposable incomes with micro transactions, that means older people with money to dump are going to be in that demographic.   
---
The time to fight microtransactions was way earlier in this century, but the market accepted it then and secured this future. This is how we fund games now because the market supported it. I remember all of the arguments that people would make in the early days about how they didn't have time to grind things in games so it was totally cool for them to be able to pay real money for currency and the like in the early P2W style cash shops that were popping up.  
---
It sucks, but this isn't a generational thing, it is more of a gaming mentality thing. Personally I think cash shops are cancer, but they have become the way that you support a game. Gone are the days of the more honest subscription fee. 
---
I‘d say Instigating for PvE and AAE for PvE. Bloodied for both.
---
Hopefully they introduce passive camp settings soon. It's pointless. Most of the time it's idiots that are bored and want bounties on their heads. Usually in groups. 
---
100 caps and a random 1 star legendary. 
---
I scrapped it all. There were 3 of them,  the were using 2 shot weapons,  I fast traveled in to try to stop it,  but it was too late. I wad trying to save the fusion generator and accidentally scrapped it too. I think im done playing for awhile. I thought this type of thing wasn't supposed to happen in adventure. 
---
👍🏻
---
I don't have the solution. However, if it's any consolation, I am stuck in the same quest. Except that I drink vodka, and it does not progress when I drink it. 
---
What kind of 3* *
---
Its a similar dilemma to what sports fans are going through. They are supporting their industry but also don't like the amount of money in it
---
Getting good involves trial and error. And in survival mode error is too expensive to bother with. 
---
I like this
---
And it even has a vault. [Link](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Greek_Island)
---
actualy assasin sentinal while crouched pretty much is invincible ;)
---
That's kind of you,  but I'm done for awhile. I have been playing since B.E.T.A, and this really killed my love for it for awhile. 
---
Cool, well I'll definitely look into it. I also appreciate your response. 
---
I don't intentionally seek out PvP but I PvP if someone attacks me so I've PvP'd a bit.
---
It always works for me if I don't kill it in one shot.
---
No idea, think that’s the stand gun, looking at the update from Beth a few weeks ago when they announced them all
---
That’s your money, and all the more power to you for spending it in a way you want, but if you’re not naturally bad at the game why would you need pay to have an advantage over players? I think we might have different definitions on Pay to Win because I don’t consider buying resources or atoms pay to win, however I would consider buying weapons and armor such as the tokens to up your armor pay to win because you’re paying to buff your player/equipment in a way someone else wouldn’t be able to reach without paying
---
Until your staggered.

---
Seconded. Had this bugged quest now for over a week.
---
Thats a very good offer and will save you a shitload of time. I did the vendor run with a buddy, we server jumped over 30 time, holding him so the other could server jump and refresh the inventory. Never found the coat...
---
Remember, this is still beta. I seriously doubt that it stays like this. 
---
I remember reading that they do not allow this because it causes heavy stress on the servers and is known to cause a lag spike across the whole server.
---
Oh ok. So we're moving goal posts to fighting now?
---
How do you swing a pick? Aim a bow? Kill with a sword?
---
I can play minecraft without swinging a pick?
---
Every now and again I a slider pop up for a couple frames when mass crafting. There's one there, they just have it disabled for some reason.
---
Hmm, strange. They certainly don't drop for me like other ammo types. Seems like to Gamma gun users would need to buy from other players.
---
The bounties I've seen seemed nominal. I've also seen camps destroyed then the player have their friend kill them for the caps. 
---
TSE is two shot explosive so there would be a small explosion with it. But right now bloodied/explosive and anti armor/explosive are super hot legendary weapon combos. 
---
Two shot is base damage of the weapon, let’s say 100 damage, plus shoots a second shot for 60% of base damage and explodes for 20%. 
---
I was thinking about this the other night.
---
It’s a beta.
---
Bethesda probably wants all the crazy op gear in there so they can see how it behaves and better balance it in the future. 
---
B4 the invis person kills ya? Dont get me wrong i usualy just go around killing spawn campers, cus they drop so many goodies.
---
All the items valuable then are not combat effective now. Nerfed and reworked since. When slap damage was a thing, you were strongest if you initiated a fight and were able to withstand retaliation, hence assassin sentinel was commonly considered best. Its only viable if you don't move and as a result its combat effectiveness is low, as vats critshots from craftable weapons can take them down, just as super-high RoF weapons with appropriate staffer perks.
---
Wear some dense chest mod and fireproof perk and you can ignore most of explosive damage, hence the best tier of most weapons can't be explosive - even with greater damage less of it makes it through.
---
Old meta is only useful against noobs in shitty builds. They don't stand a chance against the top tier.
---
That's stupid. One downvote isn't enough for how stupid that is. 
---
You pay as soon as you place the bounty. As far as Adventure mode, as soon as those people tried to collect the bounty they engaged in PvP so they aren't non PvP players.
---
Yo Imprez, I never see you online.
---
Just saying...which without saying it you agreed with, invest in better armor and you wont get 1 shot nearly as much. 
---
Why bother building then? That is the definition of insanity.
---
Lol. Awesome. Very nice of you. I may take you up on that offer. I just pulled a moronic move and rad awayed my healing factor and bird bones. Gotta remember not to swap out starched genes ever when I swap for crafting.
---
PS4 just need one cobalt now
---
Why is a turret camp near whitesprings bad?
---
I’m around. Just let me know. 
---
I thought crouching turns off sentinel gear. All the sentinel people I fight are always standing and jumping.
---
I love when people do this. I grew up in New England and Fallout 4 had a very personal touch to me. It was amazing seeing areas like Concord and the Mass Pike being in a Fallout game. Every time I go to Boston, I see landmarks featured in Fallout 4
---
I think most people use BE or AAE depending on build. For people with good armor AA weapons ignore 50+% of it and people with bloodied builds get way more damage than any TSE gun. 
---
Haha it’s funny coz I’ve got i7 3.8ghz / 16gb memory / 970gtx 
---
I can pretty much run any game I own at a steady 60 FPS medium / high settings. All of them graphically superior to fallout. 
---
For some reason fallout 4 and fallout 76 just run like ass and especially now that there’s PvP I want all the frames I can get. Sadly no matter what settings I use the game still stutters and freezes, especially in white spring. 
---
&gt;Stating that only cosmetic items would be sold in the Atom Store.
---
Your one in game example.  
---
&gt; Stating that FO76 would have 16 times the detail rendered compared to previous games 
---
And it does compared to previous games. Might not be as noticeable on PC but sure as shit is on my PS4 slim. And it runs a ton better on FO4 I would often have the game become pixelated as shit when playing but that never happens on 76.  This hasn't been a lie, misleading or sketchy.  
---
&gt; Trying to switch out plastic bags for the canvas ones advertised and the Nuka Rum bottle issues. 
---
Canvas bag is your one out of game example by their marketing department.  Nuka Rum was a 3rd party that they licensed out the rights to make Nuka Rum. Not Bethesda it self. You might as well blame Marvel for Sony making Spiderman 3 because Sony had the movie rights to make it. 
---
&gt; Refusing to refund people that downloaded the game. 
---
That has been in their Terms of Service for a while not. If you choose not to read that and just clicked to blindly agree that isn't their fault.  Sony does the same thing with digital games refusing a refund.  That isn't shady or sketchy or any of that. That is simply people not fucking reading what they are agreeing to. 
---
So you have 2 examples with only 1 actually being related to the game development side of the company. 
---
&gt; This doesn't even touch on the fact that the state of the game at launch  was so far away from what a AAA game should be, which really is the  biggest thing. 
---
An issue but not in the same vein. They didn't tell you the game was running perfectly and would be flawless.
---
&gt;  It also doesn't get into their slow response to issues like duping or patches that bring back previous problems. 
---
Slow responds based on what? You solved all the dup problems in a week? Remember when they released a hot fix 3 days after an update broke a fix and they issued an apology and admitted their mistake?  Yea really sketchy and under handed to rush out a hot fix when they messed up and apologize for it.  
---
You're okay with a green coat of paint selling for 14 dollars? For 14 dollars I can buy actual paint to paint my clothes with in real life! Or fallout 4 assits selling for 5 dollars?
---
Oh ok. Could there not be more than one of different nights
---
Nah 1 1star bloody weap and 1 1star chamelon is enough after that the gear makes no diff att all as long as u can aim. Gettin assas Sentinel off the market is not exactly ez
---
Witchcraft!! Nice work
---
Not anymore.  You have to be standing up for it to work now.  Something was definitely done to it, happening to a whole load of people I’ve seen and played with.  
---
And they die like a fly when they do so.
---
So this is why the gaming industry is focussed on microtransactions these days...
---
Inhave an Instigating 1* Sniper and an AAE 2* Sniper. I’ll be online again tomorrow if you’re interested. 
---
But you still don't get anything from it. The game actually allows you to be a jerk just to be a jerk. That makes no sense. So I guess the lesson is if you want to do PvP you should hide your camp, and if you want a social vender camp you can't do PvP. 
---
Nutella was offering you advice and not trying to be condescending, shitlord.
---
Now go level up. 
---
I’m all for this. And a few more for the 50 cal too. Bummer that some of the new weapons are lacking. Grenade launchers come to mind as well
---
Lvl 50 exterminator flamer, lvl 40 executioners revolver and hunters hooked harpoon gun, lvl 45 mutant slayers chinese officer sword, lvl troubleshooter power fist, lvl 50 troubleshooters ultracite plasma pistol and last is lvl 45 zealots trapper chest armor
---
Not part of it but have seen the posts , just figured I’d let you know there are like minded people out there
---
You think? I've never noticed one, but that'd be really interesting if it was already partially implemented 🤔
---
How is destroying an unguarded, undefended camp asserting dominance? If you want to assert dominance you should take on the player.
---
Then every single playing must be using it.  I rarely see anyone on the leaderboard who has survived longer than an hour.
---
No it's not but that's why its top tier gear, it shouldn't be easy. If it was easy what would be the point of the RNG? 
---
So your saying if someone actually builds their character properly they could get by with 1* or even 2* items (which are pretty easy to get) and do quite well? Wow what a concept lol 
---
Yesss my guy 🤙🏻🤙🏻🤙🏻
---
Well thanks anyway man
---
8 year olds aren't meant to be playing an 18 game and therefore Bethesda should be aiming to please the people the game is meant for, so no silly fortnight shit
---
The thing is, in FPS its tactical awareness, coordination, movement and aiming that define the winner. In F76 PvP, these are all important too, but not only them.
---
In FPS, you generally know which gun is best in given category and you can decide what fits you well, how you like to deal damage. In Fallout you have no idea what's best. You need to keep researching it and adjusting your character accordingly. With use of VATS, you can also come out victorious if you don't know how to shoot, move, look, hear and also you walk alone vs group, if your character outmatches them vastly. In FPS you'd die.
---
There are many FPS aspects in this game. And there are many RPGs aspects to it. Its clearly a hybrid.
---
Agreed, like most things in the game as it is atm it can't logically be dealt with nor explained. By that I mean the comment and the game mechanism...
---
Oh crap, really? That kinda makes sense, just sucks because it means it's for technical limitations, and not because they just hadn't bothered with it
---
I always wondered what „healed by rads“ means. Like if you’re low on hp, rads will heal you till you reach max hp? 
---
Yes, this is true. I have a similar build... same results. Takes me 2 to 3 shots to down someone. Switched to an automatic rifle and I can land a crap load of shots in the time it takes to land 2 semi auto shots. It shreds and probably appears to be one shot to the other player.
---
Yes! This exactly is my thoughts on the repair kits. 
---
What? I change the paint on my armor all the time and it had mods and a jet pack. Only time I get a destroyed warning is if I accidentally try to drop it after it's been painted.
---
I’d say take the other guys deal for 1500, I’d want at least 2500 for mine since I traded a 3* bloodied grognak for it and I really like it
---
I agree with everything you said here, with the addition that I assume to some degree 100% repair Kits are aimed at catering to people who only want to come online, do the daily challenges, log out. It allows people to turn in challenge rewards (atom shop points) for items that allow continued gameplay (repairs) without needing to otherwise grind (for repair costs). If they end up costing only the points won from one or two challenges, that's how I see it going. 
---
The 150% repair Kits offer mechanical benefits, only drop from in game events, aren't as good as someone with the right perks but still free players up from the almost mandatory purchase of repair perks if they don't want to go that route
---
Honestly,  they want money from the atom shop?  Lower prices and up inventory.
---
Atoms earned in game only come so fast and lower priced items will sell.  People will have to spend cash here and there to keep up especially if an item is a timed exclusive not to return for say 18 months.
---
Yea I mentioned that, but the fact is that almost everyone got a TSE during the heavy dupe days. 
---
So it’s super common in pvp and pve. 
---
Bloodied is a joke though imo lol. I ran that for a awhile with unyielding. It’s great hitting hard but with all the perks your still paper thin. 
---
I’m halfway on the anti/ex and TSE and don’t notice much difference. Also have a stealth build that works surprisingly well.
---
Because its lazy and hurts other players farming the area?
---
hi,
---
i'm interested to n. 14 and 18 weapons, how much?
---
thanks 
---
Why am I not surprised that someone's answer to a question is, "if you don't like it then don't play." Based in that logic no one should question anything in game, no one should play any games that have an aspect they either don't like or don't understand, and the game shouldn't change or be updated. Sounds great.
---
Well ya i have the caps to buy a full set though no one would take em. I dont need it though cus it wouldent make a diff. I dont even need legend weap only take 4bullets with a normal handmade to kill someone in x01 for instance.
---
That'll work. Thanks either way.
---
They could have, it's been at least a month since it happened, I camp in the deep South now so I rarely spawn near nuke zones
---
With perks and preforating on mag ofc.
---
Yeah. PC has way more responders than raiders.
---
Ooh wow! Did you get any of it recorded/screenshot?
---
 I worries👍
---
I wish fishing was an aspect too we have all this water but no marine life? Wouldnt you think that if all the land animals mutated the fish could too? The ability to fish would add a lot more recipes and immersion to the game I feel like a lot of people would love it.
---
I just completed it.
---
Unlog where you can complete the challenge, and get naked (especially chameleon effect), clean the chameleon mutation if you have it.
---
Then restart your ps4.
---
Then complete it asap, once the loading time is done.
---
Good luck !
---
the "pacify" option  will change to "tame" if it is one you can send to your camp
---
Report it as a bug, that sounds like standard game mechanics that didn't work right.  
---
Ive done the run at Charelston station probably 60 or more times by now and having seen it. I feel your pain.
---
I do / did it whenever someone messes with me. If they end up going to their camp, I’m there. It’s easier getting a 5 or 10 bounty and a chance at killing the dude than entering natural PvP and losing 100 caps if I die. 
---
It is coming. I just don't understand the point of this or having it in the game. It seems like you won't be able to play survival and trading depending on your mood.
---
So change servers.
---
Agreed with the TSE and Bloodied part. I use AAE now and have been even since before the "balance" to TSE. I like my sneak vats build...
---
Will do. I should be on in a bit. Ign lab_rat 
---
No there’s a message of it whole your painting it *with* the mod on. That’s why I said thankfully it doesn’t work. But sometimes it does.
---
You’re telling me I paid 40 bucks to access a BETA or did I misunderstand 
---
Amazing
---
I have like 3-5
---
There’s like 10 fissure sites and there always has been.
---
Yea it happens with some events too. It's just a misformed packet that ends up being recieved by the client
---
I think he means more like, they aren’t marked? Definitely are more than a few that aren’t marked by a location icon.
---
Or join a new server. Or just stop caring THAT much about a video game. Of all the crazy shit in the game, some random guy going ham on your CAMP when you can always just leave the situation seems nonsensical. 
---
Ah yes, the FO76 version of victim blaming.
---
Classy.
---
Good to know about the bounties. I wondered about that. When I said non PvP players I didn't mean they didn't decide to do some PvP, I meant the dedicated PvP players that have specific builds for it. I had low levels, power armored characters and people that were obviously overencumbered coming after me. 
---
My bro Kash made the Nuka-Cola. The rest - well with a little addiction/obsession, plastic and eBay you can do wonders...
---
I did, but it doesn’t stop them. I personally didn’t have a problem with them, killed them while they were destroying my camp. It’s the lower levels and people that are new that I’m fighting for. This game got a bad enough rep already, don’t want it ruined more by toxic people.
---
Not me!
---
That's because people dont want caps for incredibly hard to find gear, they want something they can use. Caps generally dont win top gear. 
---
I dont know where this is going or what is trying to be proved. Sounds like you agree that everyone can be killed as long as the person attacking knows what they are doing. 
---
So are we in agreement that this idea in the OP wont work?
---
Can confirm, Tank Killer works. Not sure about some legendary prefixes, but I’m damn confident that Tank Killer works.
---
It's a videogame. Maybe try not to take it so seriously. 
---
Just shoot it, it doesn't cause the others to aggro.   Somehow a Legendary 3 star glowing protectron was walking around a few days ago.  I took him down and the next protectron I ran into didn't aggro.  Knowing this I've taken down some asultrons just because, usually you can get a couple hits before they will aggro.  
---
Awesome. Thank you for the response. 
---
But you DIDN’T go and see The Worlds Largest Teapot?!
---
I've never seen that message, what platform are you on? Like I said I've painted my PA a bunch while it's had mods on it.
---
I think the atom shop is good because its purely cosmetic (maybe not after repair kits) and you can get atoms in game. You don't have to pay for them to get that outfit you want.
---
You can add me too. TuCoT1991, I'm lvl 92 PA heavy gunner/melee tank build.
---
See,  I just don't get this line of thought.  Repair kits only being able to repair so much, or you don't need to use them doesn't make them any less, or you can earn atoms in game..  doesn't make them the equivalent of a cosmetic item.   They'll have an impact on the gameplay itself in some form or another,  trivial now but maybe not so much later.    
---
There's no harm in letting the developers of a game that you care about / spent money on know that you don't like the inclusion of said items,  especially when the developers themselves said it would only be cosmetic.
---
Plus, destroying a CAMP is pretty innocuous. “Oh no, I have to repair stuff, muh resources!” Who cares. 
---
I'm talking about survival, as that is the subject of the thread.  I am 100 percent confident that balances changes are in the future for survival.  
---
Remember, the developers released the game having no clue at all about how weak heavy weapons were.  They probably released it not knowing how weak power armor is in PVP.  These legendary armors?  I'm sure they put them in the game assuming that people would find 2 pieces at most, three if the are ridiculously lucky.  Having a full set of Seintnel Assassins was likely never intended. 
---
Every online game has these people. I just try to kill them or avoid them. They do add to the danger in the game so the contribute some element. It'd be pretty boring if everyone was nice to each other all the time in this game.
---
No problem! Still waiting for energy weapons to be properly fixed, but it at least appears that Perk Cards affect them correctly—-just be sure the barrel mod is either Standard or Long, not Shotgun or Lobbing.
---
That is true it wouldent make a diff.
---
Is there any actual difference among the uniforms? I know the plans for the soldier and knight and they look identical to me. If they’re all the same it seems a pointless waste to have them all in the game. 
---
I got that when I scrapped too. 
---
I mean, me neither considering it was at a vendor.
---
Ya it would be really tough for me to pay a subscription to any game, I am very pleased with Atom shop because you can obtain everything from just playing the game!
---
I think they are planning on removing camp damage. Hope they do so soon. 
---
If you are attacking a camp that is occupied I get it. That makes sense. Not sure what you mean if someone messes with you you destroy their camp. You prefer to destroy a defenseless camp over taking on a player? 
---
How much resistance does the marine helmet have? 
---
30 yo here. I don't relly have a problem with Atomic Shop as long as i'm not forced to buy anything from there. They gotta make money somehow right? Servers aren't free. People who are making all those DLCs and fix bugs also want to eat from time to time.
---
Then again it really depends on game's business model. For example i left ESO because they charge for new DLCs and half of content they release is made for teams of 4 or 12 so not only i need to buy DLC but also i need to find people to play it with. That simply does not fork for me as i'm a solo player.
---
Sorry I’ve been awake for awhile haha, I hope they fix it in adventure too 
---
Level three Lead Belly removes all rads from food and drink, including corpses. Eat your fill. 
---
The way he says 
---
&gt; “seeing more than 3 fissure sites”
---
Would suggest that he thinks there are 3 fissure sites. I Might be wrong.
---
My dads a huge fallout geek. Gotta know where your kid got that.
---
Like marine helmet there is a Wood Helmet in the Guide and they have damage resistance

My original point was I hate it when people try to use the cute rejoinder "but the shareholders" when that argument is mostly used in the context of public companies who have goals to achieve before quarterly earnings reports come out and in Bethesda/Zenimax's case, there is no such milestone.
---
Oh I didn’t have a friend kill me. I did for the thrill and for a fight. Sadly someone’s camp had to be destroyed because of it :( and make it even worse he didn’t even show up and I gave him a chance for caps and revenge. But Atleast I had fun outta it. I had 1200 bounty and was running around until I ended up being hunted by 3 people near my camp lol
---
I agree 100%. Too many alarmists and doom and gloomers around.
---
"but we should wait and see before we judge if it's actually a bad idea!"

Hard to leave a situation you don't even know is occurring. I guess it's easier for some oeoe to attack safe stationary camps than actual players. So you aren't supposed to ask questions or care about a game? Then why play? 
---
Funny because I’ve 1 shotted at least 50 people with my 800 dmg bloodied explosive gauss.
---
This would be one (great) way to get player vending to take off
---
That’s what survival is meant for though. Dicks like these that plague adventure have no business ruining this games rep.
---
How did you lose 800 caps? What type of Gauss? Power Armor has a pretty high energy resist compared to normal armor. Along with grounded and/or scaly skin, I could see a normal gauss doing little damage to someone in PA.
---
“Shootin’ chair” coming to the atomshop soon for only 3600 atoms.  Gone forever 24 hours after release,  please insert your credit card.
---
There is no one shot in pvp, your getting two shot but most likely 3-4 shot. If they make pvp easier for you they also would dumb it down for good players that plan out their points. 
---
I dont have a problem with the atom shop, but having the ptw items slowly coming in is not okay. I grew up on Nintendo names, Halo, and the earliest Minecraft versions. I'm generally disappointed to learn that a game has a store, the main problem I had in Halo 5. It's also the reason I don't play most modern games, (Fortnite, especially.) 
---
Holy crap- I had no idea that the robots stop attacking you after finishing that quest! Good to know I can finally explore Watoga a bit more freely!
---
Plus, there’s robots all over the area and other players running around that area 
---
You can still have a beautiful world with bad gameplay. The world design team can hit a home run and make a masterpiece but that wont matter if you fall THROUGH that beautiful terrain into the center of the earth. 
---
&gt;However, it appears that they can only loot techdata from a container once, not completely confirmed but when I tried with an Alt character and the Whitesprngs bunker had not refilled after 108 hours.
---
This would be consistent with the hypothesis that the character-based lockout for looting a container is based on a history list, instead of time. Each character has a list of the last *X* containers looted, and needs to loot enough new containers to push old containers off the list, before old containers can be looted again.
---
I've had them come off of ghoul corpses at white spring when I have accidentally shot or hit a body
---
Haha, nice. Did you get some weird looks for that gas mask?
---
Victim is the word you want to use here?
---
In May it'll be in the mid 70's most places. Definitely New River Gorge National River.
---
I’d agree; I’ve had some substantial arguments on the posts about this with people more than happy for Bethesda to further monetise the game. Others simply don’t see Atoms themselves as a technical conceit to enable purchasing. 
---
10 years ago games rewarded obscure challenges with non-essential but cool stuff. I’ve used the example of Halo 3 but got nowhere. 
---
I’m 34 but remember the “golden age” of unlockables! 
---
If I know it’s their camp. It’s two-fold. One, I destroy some of their camp. Two, the more important one, I wreck one fence and I hope he wants to then attack me and enter PvP. From being Wanted now, I only lose 10 caps if I die compared to 100 if I enter direct PvP. 
---
Two shot just increases the base damage by 25%. Also adds double the durability loss, double the recoil, and 50% less accuracy.
---
They should just make adventure have 0 pvp. I never play adventure now and the people who want to play it usually just want to fight the NPCs and harvest materials anyways.
---
I’ve had a similar experience with high-Level Deathclaws in the Mire; one legendary matriarch and 4 regular, but all at 42-91. I shit my damn pants running away lolol
---
Yep it takes  x% of rads taken and converts it to health. The higher percentage the higher the lv card.
---
Nobody ever approached me about it, but I got some looks.
---
There's a Grafton monster under the bridge South of Charleston train station pretty much any time you spawn in. 
---
There should be a notice that your camp is being attacked, like for a workshop. Not sure how you got your bounty so high. A friend and I were experimenting and neither of us got our bounties over 400 for annihilating each other's camps.
---
Hey, I can say I tried to have a real debate. See ya.
---
Bounty is best that can happen to griefer. On adventure i lost 5caps instead of 200.
---
On survival i lose 0 instead of 400. 
---
On adventure are still egouth players so you can serverhop, but repairing whole camp don't cost mutch junk.
---
I was at Virginia Tech for awhile in the early 80’s. I was playing the game when I hit Beckley, WV. Suddenly all these memories came back of friends and I going up there on weekends - I hadn’t thought of Becker in years. As I walked around the Fallout version I started remembering the hillside homes, the town, and I think Beckley was where we visited one of those snake-handling churches, too. That whole blue ridge mountain area is very cool.
---
Actual people play video games.
---
If you’re a dick to other people in a video game, chances are you’re a dick in real life - the only differences is the safety buffer of the internet.
---
I bought the game and then realised it was a horrible cash grab, if you want me to buy your games in the future please add more game play and less stupid money grabs
---
The main reason is in case someone has a bounty on their head inside their home and you cant pick the lock, so plow on through.  But still being able to completely Reagan Smash ones house to nothing is excessive
---
There are armor mods that greatly reduce stagger. Also there is Medical Protocols or something like that that makes you take 50% less damage in power armor. 
---
There should be a notice that your camp is under attack. Like there is for workshops.
---
I think like 12/12 and 22/22 when over repaired. 
---
Bloodied isn’t a joke. I can 1 shot a majority of ppl with multiple weapons. I have full sentinel assassin so I can still take quite a bit of damage,  not to mention serendipity which makes half of the attacks on me do no damage at all.
---
All this happened in adventure. When I asked them why they weren’t in survival they responded that they didn’t feel like it.
---
I saw that on mine yesterday 
---
Maybe he’s level 800 and doesn’t know yet about this yet? Or he died a few times from the same guy. 
---
Hope they add these things. 
---
This would be nice.  Additionally, being able to look at your freakin' pip boy, which is "unavailable" while just sitting quietly in a normal chair.
---
Well thats worth a test, the alt is primed for that, I'll check the desks next time I am on, if still empty I'll go around and loot other places and regularly return. 
---
Yeah. Unfortunately I think there is a lot to this game that is because of technical limitations. I still love it regardless.
---
The recent Bethesda QA panel seemed to imply it was. it's intended for groups, but at one point one of the devs/panelists said "I recommend taking some friends because it's pretty hard." This indicates to me that it might be possible solo, I sure hope that it is.
---
I’d rather use “homeopathic”, but that wouldn’t make as much sense.
---
It’s just more fun to say.
---
Exactly. The environment is a human issue. The world will ultimately be fine, almost no matter what happens - whether or not humans survive what we do to it is a different matter. 
---
Xbox. I’ve painted my armor too with none of the mods being destroyed as well. But a message about it still remains.
---
Ye I think I combines 2 level 2 cards. But if there isn't a buff I'd like it be regular so I can slot something else 
---
If the person is there at the camp then attacking the house makes sense. You aren't alerted when your camp is attacked, like you are when a workshop is. 
---
Wow, totally cool that the row of houses along the railroad in Harpers Ferry were mostly faithfully reproduced.
---
But they were exploiting the bounty system, having one team member kill the others with the bounty by leaving the team.
---
Maybe i had some radiation but today 41lvl oneshoted me with black powder rifle, i am level 203. It was super funny. I was like what the fuck? :D
---
Yeah, no you aren't. 
---
Videogames are just that: games. I'm not a dick to people in the game but I know people who are and they aren't "dicks in real life." 
---
Some people just are nihilists when they play a videogame because it has 0 real world consequence. It's not my fault if you get your feelings hurt over an imaginary world with imaginary money.
---
I think I stopped by some workshops too and destroyed some stuff. I just wanted to see how high I can get it and see at what point people start chasing me. Also they may have had a bigger camp. I destroyed literally every single thing. I feel bad for the people I victimized tho lol. 
---
I usually don’t destroy camps or workshops, it was just one day when I wanted to see how high I could see bounty go and get people to chase me lol I feel so bad about it 😂 luckily I haven’t done it since 
---
You are a good person 
---
Yeah, there is only slight cosmetic changes between them. 
---
 Welcome to the pointless wastelands :)
---
There is a bug that can make this happen. I sold a instigating super sledge to a guy, got the cash and took of for some adventuring. He pops up about 10 mins later and gives me the ???-emote repeatedly. I am not sure what he wants until I notice the item is still in my inventory even though I had received the cash. Dropped the item to him, both gave thumbs up and all was well.
---
Trade is buggy, player vending machines are much needed. Glad they are delaying them to get it done right. 
---
Thank you all! I'll add you when I get on again 
---
Potentially they're rolling them out slowly because they know they will be a hot topic item each time, so it guarantees a revenue stream whenever they release it. Although releasing a bunch at once would pretty much guarantee that people would spend all their atoms on them. Idk, I'd also like to know their reasoning. We had the vault tec and camo hunting rifle skins leaked months before they were released in the atom shop
---
Ya me too, just consecutive crafting is getting really tedious, especially with alcohol brewing challenges and when I make a ton of ammo lol, or y'know just have a lotta meat to cook
---
Lie to yourself if you like, you’re still being a dick to actual people without the consequences of a face to face interaction.
---
I was guessing he was like level 200 and died twice. I've killed several guys in power armor with a level 25 lever action and crits. Also. If he was low health, serendipity may just continually be kicking in.
---
It's okay to think for yourself, you know. Especially if the alternative is parroting arguments that make you sound like a Nazi sympathizer.
---
That sounds right, I will. 
---
There's been some posts with spreadsheets and the like with breakdowns of stats of each type of armor, but after a few minutes it starts just making my brain hurt and I've decided i'll just wear whatever I think is the coolest looking. Hopefully someone can point you to the info you need but if you like robot armor, I say roll with robot armor!
---
Jesus, man, if you want to continue to buy their games with all these issues go right ahead.  I will not.
---
HEEEEEEY
---
Someone posted a while back a video of them somehow getting into The Burrows by accident, was this massive underground like city, looked straight out of Borderlands, anyone have it?
---
Actually sentinel doesn’t work while you’re crouched. And I have full sentinel assassin, and I’m far from invincible, not to mention I can instakill anyone with sentinel assassin with my build.
---
How accurate is the interior? I imagine it would be pretty cool to work in, say, an office all day, then go home and prowl around the same place headshotting ghouls.
---
Have you tried with a freshly brewed required liquid? Not one that you've had when you logged in or recently found? Had to do it with rum and had to make and wait for it to ferment and then the quest worked.
---
Supberb and really interesting. If its guaranteed an aid item, would that push out the apparel chance? 
---
Some guy fastraveled 4times as i get to him (leader of scoreboard) i was tired of his s.... And since he show me location of his camp, i did my job there.
---
Also people hiding in camps with many turets will have their walls taken down.
---
I think part of the issue with straws though is their shape, not just the mass of plastic they contribute. 
---
How banning certain things become in vogue is a little interesting. There may very well be more effective ways to cut down in ocean plastic. 
---
Let me specify, not a long time fallout fan but I am still playing.
---
No seriously. I guess I'm a graphics snob because I never played because the look never appealed to me. It wasn't until 2015 that a friend coaxed me into playing 3. Even though I still didn't care much to the visuals I was hooked. However I never finished because I had learned the game just ends and you can't continue to play after the story was over. 
---
Fallout 4 was announced later that year and I purchased New Vegas determined to complete it in a month before it came out. However I never started. 
---
I have spent an obscene amount of time playing 4 only having finished it twice but reloading a crossroads save to complete the railroad and institute storylines. But I have started it multiple times, the last play through being a level 100+ and have not found Valentine yet. 
---
Thoroughly enjoying 76, true to form haven't launched a nuke yet but have 5 characters, a 101, a 46, a 37, a 17 and a 5. Oh and a 6th on another account. 
---
Im new to this so don't take too much stock into what I say, but I just looked up a video for you. Seems the other kid is right. You can't 'tame' any pacified animal, but there are a few which spawn in certain locations you can tame. Look up a video and there's a guy who lists a frequent death claw spawn spot in the mire I believe and you can tame it.
---
Is running a radiation build viable? Do you have to do Bloodied to make it worthwhile?
---
 It looks tempting but risky.
---
Hey man, it's totally lore friendly in the Fallout universe.  The battle of anchorage was won by guys with marsupial mutations, stealth boys and sniper rifles who shredded  those bucket heads in power armor. Totally makes sense that it would be that way in a PVP fallout game. 
---
I'm planning on doing a Moundsville trip this summer. I'd like to see the  Penitentiary and New Vrindaban, and Archive of the Afterlife. Anything else I should visit in that area?
---
Thats actually amazing idea :o I'll test it when I can
---
It's real and yes there really is a congressional bomb shelter underneath it. 
---
Yup.  But every weapon has its targets it can destroy and targets it can’t.  Just how it’s designed. That’s why rolling with at minimum two weapons is best for situational purposes. 
---
No the apparel and the paints have a seperate chance
---
I like it. When posting online making any sense should be the last thing on your mind.
---
So if someone wrecks your camp in a videogame, you are going go "get in their face" if you see them in real life?
---
Dude, grow up.
---
That is funny. Any theory how that is possible? I was one shotting everyone in range before survival PVP adjustments. Are you on PC? I would not mind seeing this first hand.
---
I wouldn't play fresh charracter as i have colected many plans over 500 hours. 
---
There will be seasons tho
---
It would be nice to have such sub Reddit. I think one of the reasons why there is so little strategy topic are very misleading in game descriptions, you think you know how something should work but it's totally different. Like people want carnivore mutation to get double bonuses (like strength) but it actually only work on hunger and healing not on actual bonuses. It took me months to figure out how stuff works and I'm not 100% sure if i know everything.
---
Your imgur link gives an error. Also, Lone Wanderer innate cost is 2, takes 3 cards to max for a total cost of 4.
---
They didn’t feel like it because they’d be vulnerable to retaliation at any moment.
---
They wanted to grief safely. Cause harm without risking harm to themselves.
---
Dicks.
---
Of all the attempts only 10 were with multiple pieces. I'm afraid a more dedicated hunter than me will need to confirm the mutliple techdata item drop %
---
This tends to happen if someone cripples her head (when they instead should be going for the wings to get her to land), she seems to get stuck in that confused state that normally just lasts seconds. Though I am quite sure it can happen for many other reasons too.
---
You know it's bad satire when you have to point out that it's satire...
---
Fair point.
---
Oh.. Idk let me try and fix the links
---
I'll do 2500 GT is Harry Wagstaff.
---
Gotta save something for the bucket list. 
---
Yeah but next they'll be sending gay anti vaxxers to your house to take your guns!!
---
That because rank 1 cost 2 points
---
I like your prospective on this!
---
This is basically the best pep talk I've seen on not letting their shit get you down!
---
And I'm being sincere, not sarcastic
---
No I don't use a radiation build :o but there's a perk that gives you strength with more rads so it would be good for a bloodied melee build.
---
Well that's good to know at least that I don't have to try to get multiples before turning them in haha
---
Few things on that one, low lvls have their dmg increased for pvp. You also max out at lvl 50 so game wize it was a lvl 41 vs lvl 50. He gets the dmg increase since you have more perks and special points. With a black powder rifle he can take off 3/4 of your health so if your low on health already he could one shot you.
---
I know Beckley in the southwest of the map is correct. We used to go up there sometimes when I was at Virginia Tech (whose logo looks exactly like Vault Tech). VT is just south of Beckley by the Virginia border. VT was seen as low class by UVA... they used to tell us all dirt roads led to Tech, lol.
---
Well because it's a Fallout game. A universe and game built on the idea of a grey morality and having the option to plunge deep into either side. And in this game, since theres no real decision making, and as Todd Howard said, other players are the NPCs and you choose how to interact with them. So with that in mind, maybe ill run a few quests with Joe, but then i see Bobs camp and I just feel like watching something get destroyed, what are the real repercussions? 
---
Give people Legos, some will build, some will take apart. But you cant judge others who play differently than you. 
---
It's not even that, it's just that only a handful of weapons have skins. They released a 1000 atom skin for the fat man (which at most will be used once an hour or something) and a gold skin for the .44 revolver (even though the western revolver is superior so very few people will use it). It would be amazing to have fitting skins like a camo crossbow, a brotherhood/enclave gatling laser or .50 cal or auto grenade launcher or any big gun, a nuka world themed paint-splattered handmade rifle, a rusty black powder gun/dragon/harpoon gun/broadsider...there are so many options.
---
If someone wrecks my camp in real life, you bet I am.
---
If someone does it in a video game, I call them a dick.
---
Sounds like you just want to justify harassing people safely and without judgement.
---
Maybe you should grow up?
---
I think it’s the fact that they promised only cosmetics in the store. We know that they need money to keep the game going but it seems like a line crossed. And they don’t even address that they said they wouldn’t cross it.
---
I do not buy into the belief that something like this is inevitable and necessary. Look at a game like Rainbow Six Siege. They are also a game offering free content and have a store selling only cosmetics. If they can do it why can’t 76, especially since they said they would.
---
Yeah, there is a few spawns that can be hostile anyway, mostly a few eyebot spawns and the Colonel Gutsys that sometime spawn in the west part of town.
---
👍 gimme a couple minutes I’ll load in to you
---
That's what I'm hoping for; hard enough you WANT friends, but for those of us who want a challenge, technically solo-able.
---
I don't care if I need awesome gear and to exploit stealth mechanics and so forth; just let it be possible.
---
This.  Some perks the game thinks is worthy of the first card being worth more than one
---
Take party boy(I think) for instance.  It’s 3 points right off the bat. 
---
Yea I get it. I ran that build. Still a joke imo. That’s no different than the TSE issue. 
---
So far, I've found one plaid flannel in the game. Logically, it's called "Flannel Shirt and Jeans".  Not upgradeable, though, and certainly not camouflaged.
---
They do or craft them
---
This is my second ever reddit post and I really have no interest in Karma. I was voicing my concerns. You make a lot of assumptions for somebody handing out moron labels. I have more posts, on Bethesda's forum. They are, for the most part, very supportive of FO76. I do not like the idea of non cosmetic items in the atom store and would like to know if there are more plans for things like repair kits to come. Do i need to budget money(which I have to work for because I'm not entitled) in order to be competitive in this game. I am not the only one I think. You might also read the Moderators comments about posts on this issue. They have plans to stop this subject choking the subreddit which seem very reasonable to me.
---
Working as intended. Not a glitch. Rank 1 coats 2 points. Rank 2 and 3 cost 1 point. Making a total of 4
---
Im 203level with instagasting gauss which killed 27people just today in 2-4hits.
---
This guy was abusing (maybe accidentaly) some mechanic, maybe with event i used for fast travel, but i leaved it, before i started shooting. I don't get why his hps wasn't mooving.
---
Worlds full in queue 
---
Yes, I switched to automatic pistols for the same reason. I do still carry a BPP, however, for sentinel users. Even though it cannot insta gib, the burst damage is nice for those endurance fights.
---
There’s some really good climbing at the new river gorge. Also it’s the biggest bridge of its type in America.
---
Attacking camps with people in them makes sense. Why do the turrets bother you? They are pointless against players and only work to kill scorched and things that attack the camp. As for being leader of the scoreboard, you have to kill him, not his camp, to take his spot.
---
Is that a yes to crouching turns sentinel off?
---
Man that heavy raider chest piece looks sooo cool, I never managed to get one and I have no idea where to get the plans for it....
---
This mystery definitely needs to be solved. 
---
I wouldn’t have know if a couple higher players hadn’t taken me under their wing back in December lol. It does make exporting the area a lot easier. There are some cool finds in watoga 
---
It was just a joke. I have never destroyed someone's camp but if you want my honest opinion it's just as trivial to destroy someone's camp as it is to be upset about it. I've had my camps destroyed on numerous occasions and the only thing that was rather annoying to fix was my fusion generators.
---
I'm also the kind of person who builds non-stop in this game so perhaps that's why I'm not so annoyed by it.
---
Serendipity doesn't work in pa, unless there is some glitch allowing it to work like it was with using regular legendary armour together with pa before patch 7
---
Paint is considered a mod. Changing paint is changing mods and will destroy the mod attached to apply the new paint. I don’t understand the problem. It says the same thing when changing mods or removing them. 
---
ok
---
50% from 270 is still more than half of most people health pool and i did zero damage, but i didn't know about this one, good to know. Thanks.
---
In fallout 4 you were notified when your settlement was attacked. Not so in fo76. 
---
I've done like 30 try 's now, got nothing 
---
In real life? You have a camp in real life? 
---
We are talking about a videogame.
---
Destroying someone camp is not harassment. It's a built in game mechanic. If you don't like it, build your camp somewhere it won't be found.
---
I'm not the one getting triggered over electrons.
---
Redid links... I'm not familiar with imgur
---
I have the same issue. It used to be just the liberators that were an issue, now it's always scorched, ghouls, dogs and protectrons. Not enough to do any serious damage but it's annoying. I live on the golf course lol
---
Some people probably just enjoy destroying things idk, I got my camp destroyed a few times but it's so cheap to repair everything in this game that at the end it was no big deal.
---
they only have 28 people working on the game right now. chill with the requests
---
I'd also like "whittlin'" and "whistlen'" perks so I can whittle on a stick and whistle a song whilst I drink and rock and shoot young whippersnappers.
---
Repair kits aren’t going to be an over the top advantage. 
---
Totally agree. I might have actually enjoyed Fallout 4 the most cause I think I have a sick obsession with building things but Fallout 3 just made the transition to fps so good
---
He had no PA helmet, and low healt build, so maybe this. But i hited him 10times. With red cross showing, so idk.
---
Ah that's true. Totally forgot about that.
---
What do you play on
---
Don't forget MULTIPLE fatman skins! And they gave you the opportunity to spend another 800 atoms to get the exact same blackbird paint on your excavator so don't say then never did nothin for ya ;) And the Let's Play! paints for 3 year olds were a welcome change too! Just make sure you don't say FUCK in game chat or you'll be banned for life in a fucking M rated game!
---
Oh
---
You don't, and I'm not trying to be rude. I spent hundreds of hours researching the game and my research only indicates that there are so many things I am yet to learn. And things change, since last patch many irrelevant weapons became deadly, its simply impossible to test it all in a weeks time hence you, me, and all the other researchers can't know it all.
---
If Bethesda makes this happen, I'm moving my CAMP from Whitesprings to the Ash Heap and RPing as the old prospector parents tell their kids to stay away from.
---
Gross.  :D
---
Two words: plastic pumpkins 
---
Ooohhhhh......I thought if you painted the armor it would destroy the mod that you had equipped.
---
Are there any other negatives that aren’t listed? 
---
Maybe more post will apear and someone do some testing. I am stupid and didn't recorded that.
---
No I think placing foundations kills native enemy spawns close to you, I once set up a base in the mountain by like three Yao Guai’s and they never spawned back
---
This is funny, to me the generational divide as you call it i witness usually is the complete opposite. 
---
Im 28 and strongly against mtx (even cosmetic). What i seem to notice and not only with FO76 but its very apparent, here is that "older" players with i'd suppose stable lives and income are those being ok paying for extra things, even P2W. 
---
One of the reasonnings you often hear justifying their mindset is "i have money to afford such things so why not" or "I can't play alot so i dn't mind buying my way up", "i have other more important things to do than grinding" etc.
---
Sure young kids will want to buy everything, they don't know the value of the money since they don't earn and spend their own. So i think they're opinion on the subject is irrelevant. They may be a target but it's up to the parents to not cave in every time the kid asks. 
---
They could be able to afford it but then again it will fall into the "older generation" being ok with mtxs.
---
Yep, not the paint, I was thinking more of the apparel and the aid.
---
If aid drops 100% time with 2 tech, does that mean only aid, or would there now be a chance of both aid and apparel.  
---
I think an 8 year old isn't going to have the value of money that a 37 year old would have, is the thing here. 
---
I'm 38, and have nothing against the Atom shop. They're going to have to keep paying people to work on the game, they're going to have to keep paying for servers, hardware, software, new content, etc. 
---
I don't like any sort of PTW, and the Repair Kits are edging on that territory, is my only issue at all. 
---
If a CAMP spawns in the woods, but there is no one there to grief it, has it really spawned?
---
Same question, only with Brahmin and anal probes...
---
Idk why, I keep grabbing pool balls and didn't even think of the pumpkins. 
---
Jokes, especially sarcasm, are hard to tell from text. Asking questions and learning about the game isn't being upset. It's simy a way to get information. Its a game I play for fun. If it was upsetting and not fun I wouldnt play. The decontamination shower is much more difficult to rebuild. I just keep it in storage until I need it. LOL.
---
The apparel also has its own chance to drop regardless of what else drops so you could get one with the aid yes
---
Ok, thanks.
---
You don't need to leave team, you can kill teammembers who have bounty on head.
---
They were stupid for not taking this bounty protection for losing caps in survival. 
---
Ps4. I don't think I need any items or anything. I have level 40 armor and level 35-40 weapons.
---
Yep unfortunately.  A prebuilt structure always has its contents respawned upon player being nearby (in this case, animals are more common and faster to respawn and the turrent is counted as a creature so it would be rebuilt everytime.) 
---
Exploration is king in these games, totally agree. But that is one major reason fo76 disappoints me. The fact that I know I will be fighting enemies when I come up on a new area just isn't as good as the possibilities of the previous fallouts. I was hoping Tangra town was going to be like a new oasis but there was just nothing but crickets there...
---
R/fo76filthycasuals is another fallout sub where people do not complain. 
---
I can confirm that I fought a melee guy today who was joining the event, luring people in via some shots, then leaving the event remaining unvatsable until he got close enough to attack you.
---
Hmm I've received two reports saying the opposite, I'll have to just bite the bullet and test it.
---
Same issue here on PC.
---
Sure, I go camping.
---
People do live in the real world, you know.
---
And yes, destructible camps are built into the game, but if you were paying attention instead of getting your panties all twisted up at people disagreeing with your favorite pastime, you’d recall that the issue was a group of camp griefers killing themselves amongst friends in order to prevent other players from getting their bounties.
---
They’re clearly griefing without wanting to risk their caps.
---
And anyone with a functioning brain and an objective opinion would understand that THAT is not an intended game mechanic: Destroying camps with your friends, then leaving the group to kill and collect your buddy’s bounty to prevent their caps from being taken.
---
Sounds like you’re the one triggered here fella.
---
Don’t like that you’re being called out for being a dick?
---
Then this 270 is still calculated against the PA DR parameter, and possibly dodgy perk.
---
Really? That’s even stupider
---
This might be the most I've ever had the cringes. Not to mention you killed everyone with OCD by not even attempting to recreate the shots. This is bad and you should feel bad. Public will apparently upvote anything. 
---
Yeah I was in there by accident a couple weeks ago. Its under Harper's Ferry. Its VERY big. I kept getting lost. There were tons of ghouls. The exit is a manhole near the church in Harper's Ferry. 
---
I'd also like more customization in the damage selections , I can make my characters have scars and bruises, but I want to remove an eye. Or an ear , or melt half of my face like Harvey Dent. Some tattoos that don't just go on the face, shit you'd only see while chilling in certain outfits. Cybernetic prosthetics, be like Luke skywalker without the glove on. 
---
That all depends on the size and complexity of your camp. If you have lots of crops you'll have to go track down more. If you have a decontamination shower but are out if one of the fluxes you'll have to launch a nuke to repair it. Concrete is much harder to scrounge up for walls that wood is. 
---
Oh wow that's so cool! Interactive maps lol I had just assumed everything in game was fake or wildly exaggerated but that's so cool. Now I wonder if fallout 4  Commonwealth was somewhat accurate lol
---
Crab like creatures do not decorate them self for mating purposes, but rather for camouflage or defense.
---
Pool balls are definitely great ones too, but there’s Morgantown high school where you can collect at least a hundred plastic. 
---
Also, if you’re like me, remembering to not scrap all junk right after making bulk materials 😑 
---
That’s perfect. Is Dolly Sods a real campground? My current plan is to camp 3-4 nights somewhere and then move on to different areas booking a single night in different hotels until ending up at the greenbrier for the last night. (Yeah rooms start at about $500 lol)
---
I make my 2 kids have a mule on their accounts for my adhesive, psychobuff, and water farm.  I agree that there should be a smaller shared box option for same account transfers.  My son keeps stealing my dog foods.
---
Im a stealth sniper unfinished build, lvl 70 only, fairly noob still, I was lucky enough to find a lvl 50 anti armor blackb owder rifle, the dragon, does around 350 dmg, dont remember. I was able to kill a lvl 80 SB in 4 or 5 hits. So far I only fought the queen once with it, hard to stay undectected in all that chaos so I only managed to get one noticeable hit on her. However, the rifle breaks awfully fast, 20 shots or less. Maybe if I improve my agility, I read some guy can stay undectected with 18 agi, gotta try that
---
What horse shit.  Video games aren't philosophical ideals, they're entertainment.  "Questioning" something in a video game might be the most ridiculous use of that word in the history of Reddit, and that's saying something.
---
The game is being changed, camps can't be destroyed by players in adventure mode whenever that patch hits.  This isn't the point.
---
Camps being destroyable by players is something very easily found looking into the game.  If you don't like it, why would you play this game?  There was no way to know they'd change it after inventing a new mode.  REGARDLESS - the question was WHY someone would do this - and the answer I gave is the *only one* that matters: because that's what they want to do.
---
This isn't about changing the game, or not liking it, etc.  The question was why, and that's why, they chose to play the game that way.  It is not better, worse, more right, or more wrong than anyone else's - it was a core feature of the lore as well.  REBUILDING.  This includes the struggle against rogue vault dwellers as well, ones that aren't interested in VT's missions and are just out to scrape out a living however they see fit.
---
There you go, I spelled it out for you.  Have fun "questioning" features in video games.
---
It is so strange to offer shelves we can’t put anything on. Fallout 4 had PA displays, shelves to put items on, magazine racks you could put magazines in, etc... I really assumed that would be part of 76. It seems so obvious.
---
You don’t notice if a player is at your camp when you go to the map? Cmon, man. Yes, you’re allowed to ask questions, if they’re dumb, expect answers around that. There are so many other issues with the game that it feels odd to bitch about something that’s currently working as intended. Yes, care about the game, if you don’t, and you’ve put in hundreds of hours, you’ve wasted a lot of effort. 
---
Have read the previous posts and yes I think you can do that to stop spawning, but in the same time do you have the place to put a foundation on it and most importantly, can you place it on a torrent that has been broken down (dead body/ placing it on a destroyed  part of it?
---
Also when will be the missing sight attachments for the Pump-Action shotgun fixed? https://i.imgur.com/8P5lCS8.png
---
(also add more sight and muzzle attachments for the 10mm SMG please)
---
How someone chooses to play a game is not stupid.  Only those refusing to acknowledge their choices in play aren't any better or worse are.
---
If we had FO4 style vertibirds it would be awesome .... for the 5 seconds it took to crash the servers. 
---
I agree with your idea, but it sounds like something they'd be ready for in 2020 (and prolly sell in the Atomic Shop anyway).
---
Morgan town eh? Good tip. I wish I could remember not to junk my bulk.
---
The duality of man lol, i have never tried to build inside a pre existing structure so we could both be right, enemies near your base in the wilderness don’t respawn but enemies inside pre existing structures do 
---
Well I'm glad to see that you didn't take offense then.
---
Believe me I understand where you are coming from. I'm just saying I think its a fair part of the game. People are dicks so why not keep it as realistic as possible? 
---
Yes! I got a couple of clips, I'm gonna try to add them when i get home from work
---
On survival, turrets have crazy damage. Like if they spot you, u can run away, but if you stay on place shoting 4 turrets, u ded.
---
I have camp with two missile turrets next to enterance to flatwoods and first day of survival i got there few paper bags from lowbies that tryed to run thru.
---
So it is better for me to broke into and shoot from distance, than risk.
---
Also there are people who enjoy griefing, so if they get to any camp, they put it down just because it is "fun". Which is lame, but people are people.
---
The roads are very accurate lol
---
Good to know, I wish the other guy was as good as you were. I was buying an asylum outfit as a gift for a friend, now sad friend. 
---
People actually struggle with repairing?  Lawd help us. L2Farm. Repairing is a joke. 
---
can;t you argue that kids just want any shiny thing they see? i wanted to agree but then i thought of when i was young and wanted every single toy i saw in the commercials. of course i didn't get them but i was constantly talking about them to my parents and at school constantly with my friends. i wanted more pogs than could be manufactured, especially the special hard plastic/metallic ones. it's the same thing as that my man
---
31 year old gamer who grew up on the original fallouts, and I agree with you. I actually really enjoy the Atom shop .... so king as it stays completely costmetic.
---
Either have the Atom shop, or make us pay for content updates. Those are the only two choices that wont compromise the game's integrity. 
---
As I stands I have bought 5 tricentennial editions for myself and friends/family. I have spent probably 50-80 bucks in the Atom shop so far. As long as they keep releasing quality content that doesnt effect gameplay, I'll support it.
---
This repair kit BS is not alright, though. This isnt a mobile game where I have to pay for convenience... dont make ballistic fiber a pain in the Angus to farm, nerf white knight, and then sell repair kits for $$ to solve the problem you intentionally created. That's shady AF.
---
Ok well I’m lvl 54 and still struggle. What creatures in particular are you struggling with
---
Alright I guess I need to sire some children haha
---
Perfect, thanks for this.
---
I'm 42 and feel completely the opposite.  I've bought a handful of things I like from the shop, but I'm aware that the game needs to be pulling in revenue in order to keep paying employees to create new content.  We've gotten Wild Appalachia, the first "dlc" content completely for free.  
---
If they want to offer a few "oh shit" items like repair kits, ammo packs and MREs to the shop, I think that's reasonable.  If they can make some money off lazy people, that's great.  I personally keep my gear in good condition and have plenty of food, water and ammo at all times.
---
Don't start new character until you hit level 150 with main one. You'll learn the game in meantime and starting fresh you will know exactly what you're aiming for.
---
No problem! 
---
Ok so avoid events, except defend workshop, in which people stay hostile.
---
Thanks for info.
---
Sounds like a groundable offense to me.
---
The lighthouse looks way different in real life than the in game version.
---
Confirm that Robot Workshop boi, I GOTTA KNOW. Ty.
---
Now the question: Where is it. 🌚
---
I find it pretty hard to find the right place. I always feel like either all good spots are „taken“ or I am to blind/inexperienced to choose correctly. 
---
Minecraft has a shop? Damn, I'm 14 and I feel old
---
You don't get 100% caps tho.
---
Well, this goes back to the several posts I made about players requests aren't always the things that are good for the game. Players have been screaming we want refrigerators.. Well, lol there ya go. Want to bring back repair kits. Well, there ya go. They are listening, they are giving you the things you are asking for. Players don't always know what's good for the game. The bottom line is the bottom line, they have to make money, you want refrigerators and they have to spend time putting them in the game, textures, mechanics storage etc, it has to be monetized. 
---
In short, sometimes be careful what you wish for. 
---
As you wish. 
---

There was a floor under the turret so I couldn't place a foundation, but Iput a stash box where he died and that, at least on a first pass, it appears to not have spawned back.
---
Hmmm seems reddit mobile changed. Your little microphone use to be green for me, it is now blue. 
---
Ok then nice to know
---
Also, the mechanic can't be explained?  Please stop talking, troll.
---
It is very easily explained in the first minutes of the game.  You are a vault dweller rebuilding.  This includes the difficulties with everything else in the world outside the vault, including other vault dwellers that don't want to deal with vault tech's shit anymore and are just in it for themselves.
---
Basic lore to the rescue I guess.
---
3
---
Either 3* Fireproof, or 2/1 Fireproof/Radicool
---
Big no to allowing enemies negating my teams tactical advantage by getting on our backs during the parley.
---
I always build on junkpiles, my current base is by point pleasant underneath a power pylon with my base built up inside of it via staircase
---
Yeah, I can pacify them, but can’t send to camp. I am just wondering why!
---
Most other actual MMO type games offer some way to transfer between characters... hell, even Borderlands offered a locker you could use to transfer gear between your own characters. This isnt a novel concept-  ot sure what the delay is in instituting something similar in a game with so much RNG-based loot...
---
On second pass he spawned dead.....so now I've got no clue.
---
It seems like it just isn't balances particularly well for single player, still. 
---
Usually super mutants. Theres always a ton and they take a lot of hits. The scorpions are pretty bad as well. 
---
I lost my best weapons and basically interest in survival mode now 
---
That may be what I have to do.
---
First login/logout no turret
---
Second login/logout turret spawned dead.
---
Not exactly that. Avoid being outside the events if there are people that will join it to negate vats -  by joining and leaving them - and negate damage by cavalier set until they get close enough to 1shot melee you.
---
I know where you can get a tinfoil hat.
---
To be fair, it's up to policy makers to change or ignore wasteful/harmful behavior.
---
Well to each there own I guess 
---
I seriously doubt anything in this game will ever be hard for anyone that spends more than a few minutes reading perk cards and picking complementary gear.
---
Will probably go in naked with just a melee weapon, zero aid, and clear the entire thing in the first hour its available if the rest of this game's content is any indication of how disappointing this "burrow" will be.
---
It'd be nice to be wrong about this, but I seriously doubt it.
---
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
---
This is REDDIT mother fucker. We don't DO that shit here bitch. We fucking BITCH. And we GET. SHIT. DONE. This is a mother fucking place where we bitch because we don't LIKE something, and developers CHANGE it because we forced them to. We start mother fucking REVOLUTIONS BRO. We control the world BRO. What do YOU control? Revolutions. And you want to talk about....strategy? LLS lmmfaoooo bruh what is wrong witchu son lls lmao Go somewhere else with that BULLSHIT son. We HATE mother fucking games why would we want to talk about them? If you're not part of the Reddit Revolution against evil capitalist scum that we willingly purchase products from, YOU'RE FUCKING STUPID BRO. Gtfo outta here with that. 
---
Reddit STRONG JOIN US OR BE FUCKING RACIST YOU PIECE OF SHIT GRIEFER BITCH YO STOP MOTHER FUCKING GRIEFING US BRO
---
 There's quite a few. I seek em' out and kill the beast so I know where there are at least 7 or  8 I have found.
---
Oh man, i might have to go thereand see if I can get them to spawn. I was also scared shirtless when i saw those behemoths running at me
---
I give up taking the scorpions but never struggled with the super mutants. I use a instigating grog with maxed Melee build so they don’t have time to think before there gone😂
---
Not sure where Fallout Shelter mechanics fit in - sounds more like that vault in 4.
---
I'd love a "workshop" vault similar to 4's Vault DLC where you can build your own and attract NPCs though.  Maybe the build plans could only be available in that location or something so you can't build a vault outside of the "workshop". 
---
Right?  They just introduced non-cosmetics to the atom shop.  But nope!  It's turning the corner!  Gonna get better!
---
It’s defiantly a QOL item like back pack space in mmo games or weapon and armour slots in warframe 
---
He's wanting advise about min/max playing, which FC most definately does not have. 
---
"Unpainted" is considered a mod.  #BethesdaLogic
---
&gt;I just completed it.  
---
&gt;Unlog  where you can complete the challenge, and get naked (especially  chameleon effect), clean the chameleon mutation if you have it.  
---
&gt;Then restart your ps4.  
---
&gt;Then complete it asap, once the loading time is done
---
Unlog   where you can complete the challenge, and get naked (especially   chameleon effect), clean the chameleon mutation if you have it.
---
Then complete it asap, once the loading time is done
---
&gt;Fact.
---
No, what you’re spouting are delusions. The corporations already have you right where they want you; in their grasp, giving them everything you’re worth for half of what used to be a full game.
---
It needs to be significantly better than whitesprings.  
---
Honestly, that area needs to be nerfed.  It's ridiculously good for doing basically anything but farming specific junk.  So much so that going anywhere else doesn't make a lot of sense in most scenario's.
---
If you’re obstructing his spawn he might just keep spawning dead 
---
It would be a left over from FO4. Not sure if there is a risk of a dupe glitch inherit to it that was never fixed, but that's a possibility.
---
What's instigating grog?
---
Yeah I didn't Max melee, but I leveled it up 3x. My weapon does 118 damage. 
---
I think I got deaded trying to read this post 
---
No, I see no value on that card for any of my toons.
---
Perks I consider useful in that tree, from the top of my head and depending on build and situation:
---
- Adamantium Skeleton. (Permanent if non-PA). 
---
- Fireproof. (If using explosive weapons or fighting SBs).
---
- Sun Kissed. (Daytime and outdoor cell only). 
---
- Aquaboy/Girl (very specific situations).
---
- Good Doggy. (If not running Carnivore and feeling lazy).
---
- Solar Powered. (Same as Sun Kissed, melee only).
---
- Cola Nut. (SBQ depending on other factors). 
---
- Cannibal. (Sometimes). 
---
- Rejuvenated. (Good exploring companion).
---
- Revenant. (SBQ).
---
- Ghoulish. (Non SBQ nukes).
---
- Radicool. (Unyielding/bloodied melee).
---
Kids with nothing better to do and most likely too bad for actual PvP/Survival. Thanks for letting us know though. 
---
I suprisingly never encountered Greifers so far. Maybe I am just lucky.
---
Quick way is farming mats &amp; flux and selling in bulk to players to start out
---
I... I don't know whether to up vote or down vote this.
---
We need an Anti Grief Squad for console 
---
If in-game stores are selling only cosmetics, I consider it a lesser evil which generates some income for devs. I think I never bought any cosmetic item in any game. Games generally takes several years for hudreds of people to be made (typical AAA), and it costs $60. In-game skin is probably several days of work for couple of people (maybe a bit more, depending on how elaborate the skin is). And they are trying to sell it for $5, like it's worth 1/12 of the whole game, which is clearly ridiculous. If you want most value for your money, you should only buy original game (maybe some proper full-fledged DLC like Blood and Wine for Witcher 3).
---
I understand that games are becoming way more expensive, but they still cost $60, and the market is not going to get any bigger. So developers are forced to use those pesky cosmetics to survive. But still, if you buy it, you are stimulating devs to make more cosmetics and less game, which is kinda bad. 
---
If the store has non-cosmetic items, it's better to avoid that game altogether. 
---
Have you tried moving your camp to the boundary between the Savage Divide and the More (I assume it's the Mire that's giving you trouble)? Having it close makes adjusting to the new area much easier. 
---
Grognak axe is lvl 45-50 spawn and does 220 damage but instigating doubles on first hit so I smack  them for around 450 damage
---
Not sure, but it should be easy to test, craft some level 1 pipe weapons and go to town on some scorched
---
I've been asking for a Fallout 2 inspired X-01 paint job since day one. I'll be honest, I don't know why they don't give us more items like this.
---
You can all me anything you like buddy.
---
But I'm not guy, pal.
---
Right!
---
Get some legendaries man
---
Zing!
---
Pft, you couldn't even repair a piece of power armor with that.
---
I have some in my stash that I can't use yet. Or those I have do less damage than that. 
---
Dolly Sods is an area of  Monongahela National Forest. I don't know too much about the camping in that area but here's a link with some info. [https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/mnf/recarea/?recid=12366](https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/mnf/recarea/?recid=12366)

Went to Berkeley Springs on my honeymoon 6 months ago today, was a little disappointed we couldn't go into the castle. The town is pretty different, and they missed a lot of buildings that would have been nice in the game (like the local hotel we stayed in...it had a suit of armor at the top of the stairs, and the building was old and really cool), but some things they did right. They did a good enough job to make me interested to go to some of the places they featured in the game during my lifetime...and I encourage anyone thinking about seeing any of them...just do it if you can.
---
Before it was farming SBQ, now probably survival.
---
Not best way is some recent caps stash routes on youtube. Event farming, or selling some cheap things to vendors 
---
If you are on xb1 I will transfer for you
---
Have you read the megathread post?
---
Not much of anything, I’d wager.
---
Tell me what kinds. Are you familiar with other fallout games?
---
Ahh ein Landsmann! Hab aber leider keine PS4. Schade dass es kein Cross Play gibt. 
---
&gt;! „Ahh a Comrad! But sadly I do not own a PS4. It’s a pitty, that there is no cross play.“!&lt;
---
If you take an animal and put it in your house will it stay in your house?
---
I am, nothing much to transfer right now and I’d be bugging ya at midnight haha, thanks for the offer 
---
Matchmaking needs to be a thing if this is not soloable.
---
Don't pull a Destiny and essentially lock out a portion of the player base from end game content.
---
Yeah, 23 and in the middle. I think it’s a scummy practice that makes all the corporate humor in the game horribly ironic, but I’ve accepted it as standard enough to still use the credit they give me on stuff if it’s cool. I don’t like it at all, but I feel like there is nothing you can do. Especially because of the monumental amount of money it takes to make (and now, to maintain) a AAA game now.
---
Someone else had posted about being trapped inside the church in Clarksburg by at least 5 behemoths before. At the time, no one had any ideas if it was a bug, or comepletely random. Seems like there might be a trigger somewhere in town.
---
They all levels are 60s-80s and they tried this on my man and he level 242 so he could destroy them but why should he get  wanted for destroying them and pub pyschofox 234 is the messenger griefer last heard the 3of them were wanted 
---
Yeah, fallout 3 and NV were no problem on standard difficulty. Fallout 3 you hit the level cap and maxed out everything pretty quick. 
---
Fallout 4 I didn't pay attention to crafting much but didn't have much issues because my playstyle still worked out alright. 
---
Not a fan of what little senseless shit I've seen so far -- like just constantly shooting at me for minutes straight.  I have the habit of getting on the mic and sarcastically telling them what big men they are, OR that they seem a little cranky and it must be past their bed time.  
---
USUALLY stops the harassment pretty quickly.  But  I've had a few kids (prepubescent) get on mic and start using slurs.  
---
Was hoping all the kiddos stayed in Fortnite, but guess not. :(
---
Either they have the atom shop or you pay a monthly subscription to have access to the servers and free content and updates. WHICH DO YOU CHOOSE
---
I've updated my post with several go throughs
---
I might have just got lucky on that first try and some other player or mob killed it on the server before I got there.
---
The only camps I've destroyed was because that person destroyed mine first , so I put on all my fancy , camp go boom perks , and level that mf 
---
That might also be true 
---
That would be cool, a net gun. You shoot it and the victim becomes stuck for a period of time, kind of like a cryogenic grenade
---
Yeah I invited these guys to an Xbox party chat and they all just screeched Reeeee into their mics instead of saying anything logical or combating my claims.
---
Is that an open invite? I'm at -4 GMT and almost 40.
---
Cant you open the hot wheel, click the location you want it and then pick an item? I know I've changed weapons, grenades, cosmetics, and used food that way.
---
Still there?
---
I feel great about doing it. I had a ton of fun getting out and exploring.
---
Im with ya, i think it would awesome
---
Your right. People questioning what builds work for different things, or how to do different things in the game are wrong. After all, according to you it's ridiculous to ask questions about a video game. SMH
---
So I guess a Solution would be that there is a time limit after leaving a recent time, where killing your old members doesn’t add any caps. 
---
There’s no mystery. If I’m standing in my full sentinel assassin, I can take a 1k gauss round to the face for zero dmg. If I’m crouching I get one shotted. Almost all these “wtf!” Pvp questions can be answered very easily and simply, ppl just don’t understand damage mitigation and how the game works.
---
Sounds like you're dealing with a bunch of little boys.  
---
Kind of pointless trying to talk sense.  I am a mother to a future pre-teen boy and I see snippets of that crap in him already.  
---
I never said that they were equivalent to cosmetic items because they aren’t, but they are not pay to win items, either. 
---
Or just instead of a bounty system you lose caps for destroying people’s bases in adventure.
---
This guy has power armor. There is no legendary power armor.
---
Thing is you regenerate health when you die so why not mobs regenerate when not in combat? That's my reasoning on that.
---
I thought they made explosive suck for PVP
---
Farming outfits and plans
---
If your taking workshops your asking for it 
---
I'm on PS4 , does anyone know ultracite calibrated shocks. I got mats and caps for your time and effort 
---
Looks like yours is sold if youre still interested. My gamer tag is my name here. I'll be one most of the day so just let me know when youre ready. Thanks again man.
---
My handmade does more than 270 man. I wouldn’t be surprised if my gauss wasn’t damaging ppl if it only did 270 dmg.
---
"Appalachia" is real?! I thought it was all made up like "Boston."
---
&gt; r they’ll acknowledge community outrage and remedy the issue. Have anything of substance to add, or was critiquing my lack of vocal outrage enough, lo
---
yeah, you are right, I mean, they have been so active acknowledging community request so far, responding to it, keeping the promises they made to lure people into buying the game and keeping it long enough so it is not refundable. how can I came up with that WILD idea that they don't give a fuck about the community!
---
I live in Oregon. I think the pacific northwest would be a pretty interesting setting -- mountains, ocean, plains, rainforest, wetlands...all in one state.  
---
Yeah it helps being in a group. You have to get some really good legendaries and really pay attention to your build if you want strong  in this game.
---
First off they already nerfed explosive. Secondly your playing pvp and you expect not to get killed constantly??? Try not playing pvp
---
I said this but more sarcastic. But then crying when Bethesda wants to implement p2w items in the Atomic Shop.
---
I'd like to have clean walls to match the clean floors I have now. Dunno if the game already has them but I didn't see them in the Atom Shop. The selections in the atom shop are pretty poor....
---
How can an online game ever be finished ? 
---
You cant put animals in your house they tend to di some weird voodoo shit and teleport in and around your house
---
+karma  you’re the best!
---
It's not a MMO.
---
I use lifegiver and it makes for a really good replacement card when it comes to changing out IronClad. When in Power Armor Iron Clad doesn't work so you can equip that card to make up for the armor lost. Or you have a high endurance character (tank build) and have ironclad and life giver. I find that people give it less credit than it deserves.
---
That's a great one. Spend 20-30 minutes bulking every up for sale then hitting scrap all next time you reach a table. Only good thing is you get more XP clearing out the same five places for the plastic to do it again.
---
this.
---
The only time I go to the map is if I'm fast traveling. So to you asking a question is bitching? I agree there are issues with the game and this isn't one. It is a mechanic of the game I'm trying to understand. No different than trying to understand any other mechanic of the game. I guess no one should wonder about different game mechanics. Would you consider someone questioning different perk card builds or armor sets as bitching? 
---
Todd Howard has historically been a pretty unreliable source. It's even a meme at this point. Nonetheless, I disagree with the person you were responding to. They've made pretty big changes, fixes, and seem to be plowing forward with their game plan. It's just unfortunate that pay2win is part of that plan.
---
Pretty much this. 
---
Lol go do it yourself if it bothers you so much.
---
I'm going to try this. I have lvl 3 lead belly and lvl 1 cannibal (and carnivore mutation). I also run sun kissed, which takes away my rads during daytime. 
---
The only thing is that I also have healing factor mutation, which keeps my health high. I wonder if this would reduce the effectiveness of ghoulish at all.
---
That's pretty awesome. I LOVE the Harper's Ferry one. I had my camps at the bottom of that bridge for a long time. Did you check that corner building for Marine Armor Blueprints IRL? lol
---
I’m not talking about the power armor guy. This situation you mention in the post just sounds like lag/latency/ or something else interfering. I wouldn’t waste my time worrying about it.
---
Also the second I saw that I wasn’t damaging someone in PA, I would restart my game and router to make sure everything is working smoothly on my end, because he should’ve be 1 shotted.

As someone who started MMOs with Ultima Online: Renaissance, a 36-year-old, I gotta back the folks here.  This is how support for online games continues.  As long as it's just cosmetic, there's no harm.

This is what I've been trying to explain to another user but they can't seem to understand the concept of balance, and as of right now, survival is completely broken, for the reasons you've stated. There is no joy to be in had in survival for anyone who doesn't have these ridiculous overpowered 'god' roll tiers of weapons and armor. With the poor combat system in fallout you've got very little chance against those builds, which is evidence there is no balance whatsoever. I mean, what counters them? And another thing, how does high agility, perception and sneak play a role in PVP at all? It doesn't make a difference from what I've experienced, which means you have very little chance of success as a ranged rifle build, even with max tank killer and all three maxed rifleman perks, long shot, sniper, how does it play into PVP?
---
I'm not sure that it's a good idea for Bethesda to try this path of PVP expansion, it doesn't work with fallout, and I'm not sure why they tried it, unless they were prepared to revamp their whole combat system to suite PVP, as it is, it favors single player PVE. What they should be focusing on for 76, is what they're trying in the next dlc, the high end vault raids, that's what this game should be about. Really, they should never have implemented PVP at all, you know it isn't supposed to be in a game when there are so many restrictions placed on PVP in the first place. Why would you restrict PVP unless it damages the experience? Take destiny for example, you have PVE and PVP, completely separate, and if you choose PVP, the restrictions implemented in the mode is to balance the level of everyone involved so everyone can enjoy it. Same with cod, everyone has the same capabilites, doesn't matter if you're rank 1 or 50. And this is where Bethesda have failed with this survival mode beta.
---
Bethesda, focus on co-op style multiplayer events for Fallout, like these raids you are doing, that is what should have been in mind when you thought of a multiplayer Fallout all those years ago. It was a concept you were interested in experimenting with, well, that would have been the perfect way to do it, so people can enjoy Fallout the way it's always been, but with other players, that's what you tried selling Fallout 76 as, wasn't it? Once you see the failure of this survival mode, and see the results of having people work together for rewards in PVE raids, you'll know that's the direction Fallout 76 should be going in. 
---
Yeah, cognitive dissonance is running rampant here
---
I’m just going to get my workshops back. I don’t want to pvp. And they haven’t nefed it well enough 
---
Yes, you ready for more?
---
How else am I supposed to get ammo and cores without grinding the whole day 
---
I don't care that it's part of the game. Like anything there are work arounds. I'm just trying to understand it. Hell for all of know someone could have said you get atom points or there is an achievement and that would have solved everything. LOL
---

---
Honestly, the gameplay is bit meh and I've run out of quests to do.  But I enjoy the hunt for plans and recipes I don't have yet, exploring remote areas of the map, experimenting with the myriad possible builds (good and bad), stumbling across skeletons or teddy bears arranged in ways that tell silent stories, and hunting for elusive legendary weapons and armor to help optimize my current build.  I have mild social anxiety, so teaming up has never appealed to me and PvP is terrifying, so I disregard them and focus on the things that I do enjoy.
---
For example, I found a skeleton on a sleeping bag on a roof, surrounded by canned food and a comic book, and it made me think of a kid who'd lost the rest of his family doing his best to survive up there until he died from disease or exposure.  It's the hundreds of little micro-stories like that, scattered throughout the world waiting to be found, that keep me exploring.
---
I love the creators at Bethesda. They are amazing. I just hate publishers, marketers and the CEO. 
---
just sent an invite
---
The only thing I can figure is tank killer adding 36% armor penetration and the gauss perforating capacitor adding another 40%, giving the gun 800 dmg and 76% armor penetration.
---
Your son is probably to young to even understand the value of money. It has nothing to do with a generational divide
---
Isn't this something that they already announced is going to be implemented?
---
The pics are awesome, don’t listen to this idiot he’s just trolling
---
Okay, I typically just pay attention to the dmg total. Maybe I'm missing out on some good multipliers. I haven't paid attention to legendaries too much.
---
I use maxed out rifle damage but not the master perks yet. I have level 40 combat rifle but run out of ammo quick, and usually don't like to craft ammo--rather save it for other stuff.
---
The quest Linea are weird. I can be in the middle of the quest line and be attacking level 5 mutants. Then the next part of the quest line will be level 68 mutants. Then the next part will be level 10 scorchbeadts. It doesn't go linearly or gradually. 
---
Trust me I really hope your right. But we all know this wont be the case just wait. You also arent even reading everything I say so were done here because obviously you're to focused on what you think to even have discussion 
---
Didn’t get it
---
I had the same problem with my 1050i. Watch your resource monitor and see if your CPU it's 100% during those lag times. If it is it could be the case your processor is doing the work of the card.
---
What helped me was going into the NVIDA Control Panel, going to Manage 3D settings, Program Settings and changing "OpenGL rendering GPU" to the graphics card. Now FO76 doesn't use OpenGL but changing the setting makes the card realize it should be handling more for some reason.
---
I got even more improvement when I finally got GForce Expirence working and handeling my settings.
---
Just a suggestion I hope can help.
---
Only pc?
---
Yea I would give it a try. If it doesn't work fully uninstall all your mods and reinstall the game. Then install the mods one at a time. 
---
I am at second camp 
---
The only thing I know of that reduces staggering is the Pneumatic mod for the Torso.
---
So to answer your question: not to my knowledge.
---
I figured the turrets were as pointless in PvP as pve. I have an entire side of my camp with no turrets because the mirelurks don't attack that side lol
---
Change your build (fireproof) or change servers. They already knocked these down. If you can’t take someone 4v1 you don’t deserve the workshop. 
---
That green paint that you buy in the store is cheaper to make than the one in the game. Also you don't NEED anything from the atom store. You may want it but you don't need it.

have a friend comes to my house on friday nights to play he was level 51 (just turned last week) so we did his BOS quests up to glass caverns. then had another friend pop on and asked for help to kill his 10 scorchbeasts for enclave quest. this was around 11/1130pm. so we partied up and another friend popped in so 4 of us went to hunting scorchbeasts, started at bog town, ran down to thundermountain for deathclaw then down to fissure site killing everything that moved, during that  time 2 more friends joined us so 6 of us were out murdering things only stopping to repair weapons and loot before rushing to next kill.. by about 230 am he had to head home, he was halfway into lvl 57.  
---
it really all depends on keeping updated weapons and going after things above your level, and stacking on experience bonuses. it took me roughly 3 weeks to get a melee character fresh out of the vault to lvl 100, amost at 4 week mark with her and shes 119? i think. but i already had armor and weapons lined up for her for each step to keep her current, (my main is a 236 sniper) and at lvl 35 i was running whitesprings solo, 1 shotting lvl 68 ghouls.   
---
leveling can be done fast but stuff has to be on point and you have to kill quick, your next requip level is 45, when you start hitting top end equipment, rifle builds take a lil bit to get good since they arent melee and able to one shot things immediately. but find an instigating rifle, to help first shot damage or if you get amazingly lucky finding someone selling an instigating explosive youll notice a huge difference in your ability to kill fast and 1 shot alot more especially when headshots come into it.  
---
i noticed youre on ps4, send me a friends request, PSN Silune remind me who you are in the request and i will add you, you can come tag along with me on my normal circuit of farming mutants, sb, and deathclaws, i never mind the company, but i can help you get to the 50's atleast to get ya through your hump.

This sounds like a job for orbital strike beacons.

Bethesda's E3 conference should be really interesting this year.

Oh I’ve heard that one before, “ I tried bloodied and it just wasn’t good” or “I’m trying this bloodied build but I’m not OP all of a sudden??!!”
---
You probably made a shit build, got the wrong stuff, didn’t get all the right perks, and had no clue what you were doing. I’ve been doing bloodied since before tse was nerfed.
---
Lmao, if you still think tse is good, and bloodied is a joke, you’re clearly just a scrub that has no idea what he’s talking about. Git gud, more importantly, git some knowledge about the game you’re talking about.

Keep that keyboard warrior game strong 💪

Yes, it is.

Ammo? Excavator, Lucky hole mine for lead, West-Tek (assault rifles, 14-19 steel per with Scrapper)
---
Ammocraft and Super Duper.
---
Fusion Cores? There’s three power plants. I personally use Monongah as it seems more isolated and doesn’t burn resources like Thunder Mountain does, but with 4.....do Thunder Mountain.
---
There are mods for it. I know it's a chest mod. There is also adamantium skeleton that can prevent crippling.

Or can just not buy them and repair your stuff the same way we've all been doing it for the last six months.

I don't mind the atom shop for cosmetics, its just when they start adding in non cosmetic items that it starts to grind on me.

„Hello! Too bad, I asked a couple of times in here but couldn’t find anybody to play with :( “

I see, thanks for your response!

that's really stupid
---
The most recent battlefield is a fairly good example, because the fans want realism (or, at least a majority do) but they decided to add women to war because of gender equality, even though they weren't in war at that time period, unless they were lying about being a man.
---
There were also a bunch of other things. At one of their announcements they pretty much said "Anyone that doesn't like having women in the game is sexist" which isn't true because these people just wanted realism. 
---
Pleasure.
---
Only 2400 atoms per character!
---
So do you guys PvP or stick to PvE? Everytime I join a clan everyone is just PvPing and never launch on the queen or anything else
---
Ah damn, my chest mod is dense..
---
&gt;Really? That’s even stupider
---
Irony?
---
Firepoof and dense mod then it does next 2 nothing
---
Lower the prices and up the selection.
---
I’m more inclined to not only spend my atoms if I see a bunch of things I want at lower prices but also to spend real money when my atoms run low.
---
I’m just as aggressive in person, some people are just sensitive little bitches though and can’t take any aggression in the slightest. Life must suck being hurt by everything.
---
Thanks a ton for that I’ll try it when I get home. I’ve followed a number of unofficial guides and tweaks but the freezes persist no matter what. I have been monitoring hardware usage and on the lowest settings none of my cores or gpu is hitting 100%. As I mentioned I have no issues running other games, definitely not freezes. Sometimes they can occur mid combat for 3-4 seconds which in a PvP situation is guaranteed death. 
---
I’m
---
Really hoping we see more optimisations 
---
They don't have to listen to the community unless it starts to effect their bottom line. The company is controlled by a board of majority shareholders that don't care about the game and more about what parts of it make money.
---
I’m not even sure what you’re talking about?  I literally don’t care. Hope the aggressor thing works for ya. 
---
That map is still a bit screwy.  If memory serves me right, Morgantown should be where clarksburg is, clarksburg roughly where grafton is and grafton where Morgantown is.  Source: from clarksburg area.  Also I’m surprised there wasn’t a Huntington or Fairmont but you can’t have them all.

Yeah it can be weird sometimes. Also the players in the area when a a creature spawns dictates the level of a that creature to am extent.

I'll never tell😎 I just looked around for any none map marked structure and check real quick to see if it'll let me place my camp. Then boom good spot found.

It's all just gut feeling really.

Or not drink any booze that has a weapon condition debuff

Same exact issue here. Also on PS4.

Come on man you don't believe that. This game is a reskin if FO4 and it costs a tripple A price. A green coat costs literally 1 minute of programming.

They must be friendly and huggable.

Things like this are much more requested than repair packs. I see posts like this every day on the sub. The only repair related things I saw were the ability to salvage more when scrapping and being able to use similar items to repair like in FNV. 
---
There has been a boatload of ideas regarding cosmetic atom items people want. They just need to flood the store with more desirable items. I'm talking more than you can earn in game. 
---
I would personally buy all the responder stuff they have. Not to mention gun skins etc
---
Because having them break even faster would have been too suspicious.
---
Fast travel to Berkeley springs and it’s the train station there
---
No, it was the chest mod. Went straight to workbench afterwards, and there it was. I didn’t think I could learn the plan by scrapping. 
---
They probably get beaten all over the place on pvp servers so need to do something to try and make themselves feel hard haha 
---
The Violet Flux is ONLY to construct the shocks, repairs don’t need them at all.
---
The only downside to the shocks is that it knocks the leg durability down pretty far, but since PA is pretty durable in 76 it’s not such a big deal. Even better with over-repair and perks.

This is all I can find with 5 minutes of searching my desk, but I have them all on Steam too:

Is the Soldier's Certificate required?

Which platform?
---
Level with only level 1 armor and a knife/powerfist

When did they mention this? I can't seem to find anything online.

IDK maybe this game is just over my head. I never figure out any of this stuff.

I want to play by myself primarily, as that's how I like to experience fallout. I like scavenging and prodding through terminals. Soaking up the environment. I've never played these games very systematically. But I will add you.

I didn't realize there's a quest in which I have to kill 10 scorchbeats later. I haven't killed one yet, I just run away.

The moderators post that exact statement every time.

Your entire response implies you haven’t actually spent any time reading this sub.
---
Make a vats based pistol character, you can crit every other shot if you build properly, with 15 agility, bird bones mutation, shielded raider underarmor, gun-fu perk, and grim reaper’s sprint perk, you can stay in vats for a long time
---
Do you have a source for this? My understanding has been that dolphin (the fish, the east coast term for mahi) is relatively low in mercury, particularly when compared to other fish like tuna.  I also haven’t been able to find a source stating that the mercury in fish comes from anything other than pollution. Let me know if you have information to the contrary. Thanks!
---
You think OP would realize that. There has to be some kind of penalty for 15% more damage, you know? Weapon durability is probably the best choice even if I don't like it.
---
Yeah, I love the area but I feel like it's such a chore to get around with robots popping out all the time (I actually feel like the whole bog area has been a chore to get around). I actually finished the quest like two nights ago and quick traveled back to my camp. Guess I'll be doing some walking around tonight!
---
okay thank you.  seems like a work of weeks to get that much to be able to craft.

That damn Highwayman was a pain in FO2 until they patched it.  Driving to Vault City and realizing you left the trunk of the car in the Den.

Unethical life pro tip: Whitesprings is the best place to farm junk especially if it's a nuked zone. You just have to pick up the random paperbags :D
---
nope, waaay different. 
---
People do sell flux, it isn't especially hard to get though.  You don't need it for repairs, only for crafting the mods.  
---
Best way to get violet is from Fissure Prime nukes, put on the Green Thumb perk in Perception and pick all the ferns.  
---
Obviously you need the irradiated materials as well, and since flux decays you want to farm them first. Whitesprings nukes are generally the best place to collect Glowing Mass, High-Radiation Fluids, and Hardened Mass. Combine 1 of each of those 3 materials with 10 Raw Violet Flux to get Pure Violet Flux.  
---
The whole process will likely require jumping multiple servers. Find a WS nuke first, kill ghouls till you've got at least 10 of each irradiated material, then find a server with a Fissure Prime nuke and collect ferns, of which you will need 100 in order to make 10 Pure Violet Flux. It might sound like a lot of work, but it's really not that bad. The pitcher plants and tarberries also turn into violet, but the ferns are far more plentiful.

---
Armor penetration does not add together. You need to calculate them one at a time highest to lowest percentages. For example:
---
40% reduction of 100 armor leaves 60 remaining armor. Then,
---
36% reduction of 60 armor leaves 38.4 remaining armor.
---
So you only have 61.6% armor penetration. My BPP is anti-armor so armor is not stopping people from dying instantly.
---
Is that 800 the damage displayed in your pipboy? My 1,800 calculation is after all sneak, headshot, critical bonuses. I only have 301 damage on my BPP. My only working theory is that perhaps weapons have a cap on damage based on their base or paper values. Paper is the number in your pipboy and base is the damage value before any bonuses. Base is also what is used to calculate critical bonuses.

Why not just use chems for that 15% damage boost
---
There was definitely 5 or 6 on mine. I've gone back repeatedly trying to get them to spawn again and have had no luck. It Could be a bug but who knows lol. 5 behemoths seems like a little much to be running into
---
I see your point with that specific game. I haven't played that Battlefield so I may be off on some of this. But the same fans that bawk at adding women in the name of "realism", don't take issue with respawning, generic "body armor" taking damage for leg shots, weapon skins, dialogue/accents that are out of period, and other glaring offenses to "realism" in video games. When they focus on one to the neglect of the others, there seems to be a sexist component to that.

It was meant to be, they said that they took coding from fallout four and modified it for multiplayer, which the code wasnt meant for which obviously lead to issues, but its getting smoother and better,

---
I dont understand your point here? Not really a response to my stance.
---
But okay, I'll play ball. Having a notification wont make a difference. People will still attack, but you only get to go back, fight them off, and theyll be back. Just like the gameplay loop in Fallout 4. 
---
You want everyone to play nice with each others camps, but its a mechanic in the game for reason. Even in the trailers you see players attacking other players camps. Its supposed to create "tension and action" between you and the other players. Sure 76 is a huge fart on the PvP area, but that doesnt meant someone cant opt to play as a raider and break shit for the giggles.

---
&gt; No other competitive game does this.
---
There are a lot of competitive games where you don't need to grind for stuff, to be competitive. For example CS:GO where you can start playing on a fresh game and can fight against equal skilled players (most of the time) and don't need to grind for anything. It doesn't matter if you have in depth game knowledge. Sure you won't get any better if you don't want to learn other stuff around the game but you still can have fun. With a smurf i was for 2 matches in silver 1 and i tried my best to play as bad as i could. It wasn't bad enough and i played with a controller. So i think everyone can have fun, when not other players are ruining it.   
---
Other games do this too. There are games with stuff that you can unlock and give you minor improvments but these are just minor.  
---
I didn't played Pokemon online with randoms. I played with friends over a link cable and we made rules up, so the game is fair. Modern games can put players against each other with equal gear, so the game is fair and both can have fun. Sure I won't attack a player that is 150 levels above me but in survival you don't know. Probably this wasn't clear, the wanted player was not there anymore and the player that killed me, wasn't on the map. Someone told me that the level in pvp don't matter and because you don't gain special stats over level 50, i would think that the only difference is on the time the player spent on the game and was able to get more rarer stuff.  
---
It makes no sense that Bethesda puts such players against each other. As a stronger player it doesn't make fun to attack weaker players and the other way it also makes no fun. But there are people that only can fight weaker people and start bitching around and starts with their gatekeeping. 
---
So my initial post is still right. Survival is broken and bethesda needs to fix it (they probably will, because its still Beta) to make fun for everyone. It makes no sense to say "don't play it, when you don't have the right gear", because it makes the whole situation worse. So the stronger players now get more xp, more caps and unique gear. Totaly fair for weaker players, that still need to grind hard for stuff and stronger players get more stronger. To be fair, i could avoid any player contact and just try to complete the quest for the unique weapon and still get more xp but this is still bs. Why entering a pvp mode, when only doing pve stuff?   
---
Plans make it so you can craft the mods at your leisure, whenever you like, as often as you like, so long as you have the materials to craft the item.
---
Off the shelf mods are 1-use only, but require no materials on your end.
---
The alcohol buffs can actually make your weapons degrade slower. +15% nominal damage means 21% real damage, so you need less condition loss per kill.

But hey it took some of the focus off of how much of a moron you are with no knowledge of the game and you’re just on here talking outta your ass about shit you don’t know.
---
That would ruin everything 
---
I was briefly concerned by this post, but it caused me no grief.
---
I can’t help you with flux, but I have two t-60 calibrated shock mods I was going to give away to someone who needs them. I’m on ps4 if you want them.  I don’t think you need flux when you have mods. 
---
Your face scared even super mutants, impressive.
---
So how about it? 
---
Honestly, I’m actually getting really disappointed. 
---
The list of bugs I’m aware of has gotten *fractionally* smaller since launch. Stability has improved, yes, duping seems to be somewhat resolved,  yes, and some of the gamebreaking bugs (Power armor skeletons) have been resolved.... but the list is so massive, and new bugs have shown up while they’ve fixed old ones, that barely any progress has been made on shrinking the list. It’s like, they fix the game-killing ones and that’s all they bother with. It’s really disappointing. 
---
Strange in Numbers is massively broken. 
---
There’s all KINDS of weird issues with weapon mods across the board. Like, if I started making a list of these, it’d be about 300 items long. Did you know there’s no Prime mods for 10mm pistol? At least, I’ve never gotten one, and my main has prime for every weapon (queen hasn’t dropped new prime mods for me in the last 10-20 kills; she drops plans you don’t already know) 
---
Energy weapons still have massive balance issues (can’t be silenced. Can’t use armor piercing effects. Ash/goo piles can’t be searched with Butcher’s Bounty)
---
Power armor mods are either broken, mislabeled, or have weird availability (recon mod for helmet is only available for x-01, explosive vents don’t work, optimized bracers only work on unarmed attacks but aren’t labeled as such)
---
Cap collector perk is super annoying, as is the cap locator perk, after the change to cap stashes. 
---
Super duper and Party Boy not working with the new alcohol is an incredibly lame inconsistency. I understand it’s intentional, but it really shouldn’t be. 
---
Still getting drills/syringers as legendary drops. 
---
So how about it civilian? 
---
Definitely you that’s triggered bud.
---
May have to do with available build space since they take up a bit.
---
since last server patch my game is dropping frames from solid 60 to 1 digits and back or ctd its sometimes un playable.before it was fine. its getting frustrated.
---
Yeah Microsoft has grown soft, only feeding the toxic kids by suspending any sort of “bad language”
---
I tested it myself, rank 2 lead belly gives you 5-6 rads when you eat a mutant and 13 when using ghoulish rank 2
---
&gt; They are going to put out a cutscenes trailer with some dope ass music
---
That part surprised me recently about BL3. We already got the same game 3 times without any real evolution and I'm eagerly waiting for what they did to the formular and core gameplay loop.
---
Yet all they did was release a trailer with some generic combat gameplay and everyone loses their shit.
---
If we're that stupid, we deserve getting exploited.
---
This is awesome man, whats ur gamertag? Eould love to see the show
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m4sA-lJt2lV5r4NjkGNgyVUGNwjRMLN-ishup58v_Qs
---
Id say get a couple heavy robot limbs, and get heavy combat armor for the rest of the pieces
---
Trying to find where I found the information. It was years ago during my undergrad in my Ichthyology class. But based on what I’m reading now from journal articles you’re correct in that Mahi Mahi have low mercury levels.
---
Nope, identical in appearance.
---
They also take the same mods.
---
Well, the theory is that’s basically 0,0 in the world coordinates, so if it hasn’t “placed” them based on save data yet, that’s where the icon shows until it resolves their “real” location
---
Huh, that’s odd right?
---
That would be awesome!!!  
---
Lol nice. Is it the X01 maybe?
---
Mutations dont even affect or negate perk cards
---
Them adding together is irrelevant as in the end they both will each give a finite amount of damage increase, regardless of enemy armor. 
---
And the 800 dmg is the dmg listing in my pip, but a majority of the time in PvP I never see the sneak attack dmg message pop up.
---
i would but i mostly play alone.
---
I'm having a hard time finding it but I remember when I got my nintendo ds the price was around 40 bucks for Nintendogs.
---
And going even older Jak and Daxter was $50 at retail. That was a full game with several minigame modes and a complete story.
---
 https://m.ign.com/articles/2001/12/06/naughty-dogs-jak-and-daxter-arrives-at-retail 
---
Also why do you guys defend triple a companies? They're multi billionaires they dont give a shit about you.
---
Look at games like Dead or Alive where in the newest ones they paywall off some peoples favorite characters. Something that was once completely free you now have to pay for. They do this everywhere.
---
Yes,If you have to many items you can’t run or fast travel 
---
Lol nice. Is it my X01 maybe?
---
i am thinking maybe a explosive build. but i don't know how i am gonna get there.
---
That's because your weapon is explosive what most likely still counts as multiple hits and bypass protection.
---
My psn: Wunderkind1980. 
---
Glad to help. I was saving them, but I run a t51b, so I really don’t need them. 
---
👍
---
You wanna tell me again how my words hurt you yet somehow you’re not triggered even though you were bothered(triggered) enough to mention it?
---
Yep, rad storm a comin... can feel it in my knee. 
---
wait 16th? not 9th?
---
already did a sneaky sniper build. kinda wanna do something different.
---
Well, in my opinion, adding women to the game was the most glaringly obvious point that people mentioned, as well as the most clickbait thing possible, which is what YouTubers and Journalists both need to create to survive. That's the only reason more people cared about women being added, because it was the easiest thing to peddle. 
---
Is that what’s happening? It’s so nice and peaceful on this sub today. It’s like the sun is shining.
---
Once you've hit max caps, why not? 
---
we will call that the iron man build.  but no thank you i get punished enough on survival without trying to gain on the system.
---
Yeah I really love Fallout 76 as well but I defiantly agree with you that it's not the healthiest direction and I have already uninstalled the game, I am kinda sad to be honest because I am a huge fallout fan.
---
Just messaged you! We're going to do it at my buddy's camp he has a boxing ring setup
---
You can not remove ability to burst players or it will be stim fight. Unless they will change as well how healing works, there should be cast time for healing otherwise only insta kill can balance is.
---
Ok i will ad you right now
---
There’s been talks of prestige system. But 100 should have been the limit. Most perk builds are complete by 65ish. Make it to 100 prestige back to 1 receive something other than a high five. Repeat. 
---
The explosive dmg is added to the pip dmg listing. And anyone with dense and fireproof 3 takes no dmg from explosions anyway. And I’m not using my gauss and staying way back if they don’t have dense and fireproof 3, no I’d be rubbing up 1 shotting them over and over with my bloodied explosive pump or bloodied explosive Tesla shotgun.
---
Add me Colossernaut is my psn name
---
Mention it? I just responded to a response ? You know normal reddit shit. 
---
Enjoy your day ! 
---
Basically the mods have stated they’ve heard enough of the repair kits thing the top messages got removed and any repeated posts are removed to keep the feed clean for useful discussions 
---
Lazy 
---
you dah real mvp
---
Definitely agree with the media portion, they're the source of so much of the impact we feel from issues that could otherwise go unnoticed by a ton of people
---
I thought so, too, but then again 76 was a lot of asset transfers from FO4, so I figure some stuff slipped through the cracks.
---
I didn’t even see any differences with the skin/mesh, like maybe one would have been newer or in better condition - nope.
---
Add Me. I have 10 violet flux you can have for free.
---
Fireproof and dense will not stop explosive DMG on survival unless combined with sentinel
---
I wasted caps thinking the plans had at least some mods. I really want at least some sights for it. A bigger clip can make it OP tho since the small capacity is really the only downside for it along with the expensive ammo type it uses.
---
Honestly once you get Knight, only the left arm paint is different until Officer.
---
Because it's a game and it's supposed to be fun for me not for fucking mobs
---
To be fair, that 15$ was a complete money squeeze. Blizzard could afford to run WoW, along with all their servers (not just WoW), the electricity bill and heating bill, for 1$ per WoW player. At least back in WoWs hayday. We know this because of financial reports that Blizzard files where they mention their cost. Server cost was so small it was just a footnote.
---
That other 14$ or 168$ anually was pretty much profit for which they developed maybe two content patches with some new items, a dungeon or two and a new raid tier.
---
They still charged people (almost) full price for expansions which alone covered development cost and then some. They had a cashshop and charged for services like name change and server transfer.
---
They milked WoW players and by god they milked them hard. 
---
People paid 15$ a month because it was worth it, not because it was the minimum needed to just keep the game running. Not by a long shot.
---
Arnold Schwarzenegger will be there!
---
Mods that do their jobs? 😳 Wizardry!
---
Yup crying about how my words were aggressive and made me a keyboard warrior, yet in reality you’re just an overly sensitive lil bitch.
---
Do you cry and feel victimized every time someone tells you facts you can’t argue and puts your ignorant self in your place? Life must be tough for you.
---
Lolololol.
---
Wrong. Wrong. Wrong.
---
Lmao, I bet they just use a bot that picks up specific words and so kick rocks to it
---
We would love to have you there!
---
I have dense and fireproof, explosive shotgun build will still kill me
---
So you died in a workshop? A consensual PVP zone? Cry more 
---
I think the only other weapon type in a SPECIAL you're not using is pistols, and they aren't great. Your Str character could just pick up the perks for 1H or shotguns. I guess explosives, Mirv grenades are pretty good
---
😭 somebody save me from big mad over here 😂 
---
There are no plans for crafting wood armor, they are completely uncraftable, there is only a plan to put shrouded on your wood armor
---
Correction, explosive critical shotgun build will still kill you, don’t get the two confused.
---
LOL! I know right?  Bitching about pay to win, when that's all survival really is at the moment. Virtually no one I know succeeding in survival is playing with gear they acquired through just through grinding. 
---
It's the only set spawn point in the game. I found one in a dresser in a random house, but I'm sure it was just a random drop.
---
We want different kinds of stairs, not redesigns of the only existing metal ones.
---
No one can help your pathetic ass
---
One spawns at the temple of the winding path on a table in a makeshift shooting range on the southwest side of the complex. 
---
Yea. Its a random event
---
I have fun playing it so I'll continue to play it. It's crazy right?
---
That is a spawn spot that will have a chance for the vendor bot, was it at Charleston station or lady Janet’s soft serve?
---
Still green for me.
---
Make a subscription based private server for $50.00 year. I would pay that to have fun without worrying about griefers or simply to be able to play without anyone around or just with friends.  BSG makes $$ to cover server costs and I'll still buy Atom store stuff if they make something cool (so far not much has been essential).  How about charging for a larger CAMP space with a bigger build budget.  BSG is clueless how big CAMP building is for $$$ in the Atom Store.  Take a look at the Homemaker mod in FO4, copy it, then sell each item for $2 (not $20). Unlock a toilet you get all basic colors.
---
I can help you learn the ropes of this in-game and can also craft T-60 Jetpack if you want one, it costs flux as well.
---
No you don’t have fun man. You’re lying to yourself. How can you sell yourself out like this? 
---
Become a hoarder and pick up everything you see. Everything has a value of at least 1 cap excluding some things that can't be sold or have a value of 0 caps.
---
Legendary super mutants are cowards will run away from any fight even from radroaches, Bethesda joke.
---
Just out of curiosity, what would you need those for? I can't seem to find a use for the gamma gun, so I scrap/sell all them I get. And drop the ammo lol
---
Maybe your criticals have been triggering the escape response? Or maybe the topography and pathfinding is screwy. Alot of times ghouls will run across the entire map rather than going up a staircase for me.
---
It's a running joke that Bethesda has. Basically since the beginning of time all players hunted and killed legendary enemy's. They earned to run and hide from players.
---
That's true dedication to the genre. Bravo.
---
If after these go live and I notice my gear breaking oddly faster than normal, it’s game over for me... I’ve played Shroud of the Avatar... don’t need to remember Fallout going down like that 
---
Yeah, *some* nes/snes games were $40. Big snes games, like final fantasy ii/iii were $70 at launch. N64 games were pretty much the peak, with new prices between $60-90. But the thing is, even those $40 games, when considering [inflation](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/) between 1990-2019, were the equivalent of like $80 today.
---
As for 200 hours, by far the vast majority of games in the nes-snes era could be beaten in a single sitting, maybe 4ish hours. They increased gameplay by limiting lives/continues and making the game's arbitrarily hard (things like one hit death with unclear hit boxes), but make be mistake, there was only a few hours of content, you just repeated over and over too you memorized it enough to not get killed. There were a few rare exceptions; Final Fantasy had maybe 30-60 hours of gameplay on a single playthrough. The ps1 era had a huge surge in jrpgs, which would break into the 100-200 hour range, but that still wasn't most games, and the price was typically in the $50-59 range, which factoring inflation from 1995-98, would be like $75-80 in 2019 prices. 
---
NOW games cost $60, sometimes with an enhanced edition that costs 80ish--which is about what you were paying, value for dollar wise, back in the nes-ps1 eras. Maybe there's a collectors edition that costs even more, but the extra price there is usually for physical goods, so you can't really compare it. Then there's dlc that costs extra, but that's not paying for stuff that would have been in the base game, that's paying extra for extra stuff that wouldn't have existed.
---
Except the user was in a workshop.  So I doubt that will change. 
---
My favorite bored past time is sneaking into people's locked houses and laying on the bed/beer rug naked until they realize I'm there, then I give them the thumbs up and fast travel to freedom
---
 Not crying, and your an asshole. A valid complaint made by a player. The griefing crap is annoying as hell to regular players. Why am I suddenly a cry baby cause I complained about an ongoing issue ? Or did you need to feel bigger than someone for a minute like the losers me and so many others are referring to ? 
---
Yeah, Legendary Super Mutants do that.  Just hearing the panicked "RUN AWAAAAY!" is usally my first sign that a Legendary is in the area. 😋
---
What a load of bullshit lmao
---
Don't take workshops or don't cry. Plz choose one or the other.
---
You should always go for the armor penetration magazines if you want the gun to do the most damage it can do. Perforating magazine will always net you around a 20% dmg increase.
---
No, but thank you for saying please.
---
It’s on the roadmap.  We may even see something next week if we are lucky.  
---
I currently use roughly the same faces for my characters, but I don't like having to spend time doing it all over again for every new character I create.
---
Fallout 1 basically introduced me to TB RPGs back in the day and what excited me for Fo76 was Fonline 2238 (back in 2012?), basically a realtime MMO mod for Fallout 2 with super harsh pvp rules.
---
Go near any city and you'd get swarmed, killed and enslaved by high level clans immediately. Every little step you wanted to take required careful consideration.
---
Sadly Fo76 turned out to be a jack-of-all-trades that just disappoints on all fronts due to lack of a clear vision. It feels like someone just threw popular systems together and called it a day.
---
Soooooo I heard Anthem actually sucks. Fallout 76 on the other hand, is actually a really great game...with a rabid fanbase. Almost as if driven by the Scorched hivemind itself, they are driven to complain about every little splinter they get from this magnificent machine that is Fallout 76.
---
I think they like the abuse honestly...
---
OP is a Millenial, too! So am I. (The year range is 1980 - 1995)
---
The new generation of kids and teens are starting to be labeled “iGen” by some — a reference to them growing up with smart phones in the way that we grew up with the internet. 
---
It’s interesting seeing how the newest generation forms views on this stuff.
---
The workshops are consensual PVP zones, every resource you can get out of the work shop you can get outside of it. Someone Contest that workshop they can kill you and take your stuff that’s the whole point of a workshop. Claim in a workshop your consenting to PVP, not a valid complaint your dumbass just doesn’t know the game mechanics. And 
---
You’re* 
---
Says the guy who spends his time being a big mad bitch online. 
---
yeah i like pistols but they have a big problem. no silencers for the best types. .44, western revolver, etc... so they break stealth very well. i could go with the automatic pistols but that limits me to 2 pistols and legendary farming will be even harder.
---
You should be ashamed of yourself, it’s disgusting you’d try to compare the two especially when it’s just trying to get the same point across from the last two days with out your post being deleted by the mods 
---
I despise the game but I get so much pleasure visiting the state in the game, as someone who has moved away.
---
. They say it’s hard to get through victims of abuse. Do you let people IRL treat you like this as well? Should I give you a hotline or something? I’m worried about you folks here. If you need help just visit 7cups.com 
---
Violet's not that difficult to get as long as you're comfortable with wandering around a nuke zone on your own. Farm the mass &amp; fluids somewhere with a high enemy density like Whitesprings, then walk around Prime after the queen's dead and pick up all the ferns with Green Thumb. Use Super Duper to craft the stable flux and you get a few extra.
---
My psn is raza1849 if you want to add me
---
You still around? I could use a couple serums. GT Fizzwick.
---
Yep. Shouldn't be able to pay to win. 
---
Frag grenades are weirdly wide spread in this game. Most dead raiders have a frag on them,  and nothing else. Explosives are pretty good, I end up having to VATS shoot my grenades though since most enemies are too fast to be hit in the middle of a battle.
---
Hahahahaha, il c you in the wasteland!
---
This game is beyond fun and I have to force myself to stop playing most of the time..I guess I'm lying to myself?
---
Word nazi are usually worthless people, dont be a dick, and honestly, if you haven't figured out most people dont agree with that rule, that's your issue. As I say, no one was an asshole but you. Feel better about yourself ? 
---
This is the first I ever post here. So if someone else made the exact point as I did, kudos to them. I can’t understand why you turn down help. How much longer do you want this company to abuse you? 
---
I remember this annoying me in f4 too.
---
No I will still instakill you by putting 3 crits in your head in 3 seconds. Doesn’t matter what armor you have.
---
I recently made a new character and would gladly group up with you if you like. I can even share the Inspirational perk card so that we can level up slightly faster. My username is Z0MG\_H4X.
---
Some men just want to watch the world burn. 
---
I think cosmetic only stores are the best invention in the history of games as a service. You only buy stuff you want to buy, not stuff you feel like you have to buy to keep up. Game gets updated, new content drops regularly for free. 
---
If I could get some HESCOE barriers and some afghan contract guards I'd feel like I was right back in the Zormat valley...
---
RETREEEEEEEEAAAAAT!!
---
Great, look forward to it!
---
The only person mad here is he guy calling others keyboard warriors just because you got butthurt over me calling out your bullshit and putting you in your place.
---
And you waste your time spreading misinformation on the internet, that’s worse than all of it.
---
If you claim a work shop you’re consenting to pvp, dosnt matter of you agree with it. It’s how the game is set up, you’re upset because you lost
---
Hell. Yes.
---
My gamma is full auto and does 125 rads per shot so it's great for teaching bloodied guys in assassins cavalier a lesson.
---
heres the build i am considering.

---
Mine was only lvl 15
---
It's fucked up that you are comparing some dumb video game drama to domestic abuse, which is a very real and serious problem.
---
Just go back in your hole and hide til the next troll bait is comes out.
---
Cool, is your ign zharkul76?
---
Not certain where I read it but from FO4 luck did play a factor in lootable items, including power armor spawns. I assume that is the same in 76.
---
My next build for a new character is either shotgun or bloodied 
---
ummm, what? are you ok? we play the game cause we like it. we have fun playing it and with friends. we laugh when we do stupid sh*t. We cheer when we launch a nuke. it's just a *GAME*. Chill.
---
Yes! Yes! I want a hardened receiver, stabilized stock, silencer or at least a compensator, and a short scope or ring sight. Please.  Make some cool skins too and I'd throw $$ at you in the Atom Store BSG...
---
That's dumb af
---
Dude, you’re acting like we are on different pages with our opinions. I’m saying either they’ll remedy this or give us a big ‘fuck you’. Chill the fuck out. In ANY case, it’s a game. Good lord.
---
That would be pretty fun. The area of effect could hit multiple targets and split them into different locations. I’m totally digging the grande idea.
---
😟 What are you talking about? Wow Bethesda has brain washed you so much? Do you watch Yongyea on YouTube? I think he covered this topic very well. You need help guys. 
---
Translation - I don't like this game, so you shouldn't either.
---
Yeah, I still need you,
---
I'll definitely pay you for you diligence and time
---
I literally want them. I don’t see the freakin issue. It’s not affecting anyone’s gameplay but my own. 
---
I am!
---
Your entire post history is about mobile games. You are not even qualified to comment about Fallout games in general, let alone Fallout 76.
---
Nope, the hunter never befriend the pray 🤘
---
This was an awesome post.  I've been thinking about going to WV since the game came out.  I would like to stay at the Whitespring when I'm there
---
A ring site would be ode coom
---
You’re a fucked person, to begin to compare a real life problem of abuse to a that of a game company that makes money and has to do so to keep the servers running, you’re just rehashing all the bullshit like you’re some kind of crusader 
---
People play this game for fun and most people won’t even fall victim to half the shit Bethesda or any company pulls 
---
Ah, I see. A raider then?
---
What is your argument exactly? That just because the average player doesn’t survive longer than an hour that non-pa builds aren’t greatly superior to PA builds? That’s a terrible argument, ignoring so many other factors that it brings the question wtf are you smoking to mind.
---
They actually made a lot of weapons last much longer in last patch, cut the bull shit.
---
have to have animal friend and wasteland whisperer equipped, have to have 6 charisma, and have to have 10% open in your build menu, has to be a specific animal, took me day and a half server jumping dozens of deathclaws before i found one i could tame and send home. 
---
I have a poloroid of my wife in front of the church in harpers ferry, we took it 10 minutes after we said I love you for for the first time. I imagine my in game character cried a little when he saw it. 
---
Yongyea? the guy that only tells bad things that happen to games and not pros? the same guy that waited 3 weeks after to report a topic about bethsodia making fallout "pay to win" with the unstoppables promotion? 
---
That is not how I remember Daggerfall...
---
Well usually one goes through ones post history and say “he is an incel!” But this is the first my opinion is dismissed over mobile games. Speaking of which have you noticed how messed Skyrim Blades is? Coincidence? I think not. 
---
Does this mean crossbow meta is gonna be a thing now?!!
---
Beth should really add a perk that boosts survivalist combat(throwing knifes, tommyhawks, crossbow), maybe a perk card to give you some grappling moves and range increase for unarmed combat.
---
And just make the crossbow a heavy weapon so it can benefit from those perks, then introduce crafted arrows with explosive, drugged, and tactile tips.
---
Nah, lonewolf 🖤
---
Ok, if you change your mind, your welcome anytime
---
How about your sneak skill goes down the more ripe you get in game.  The enemy can smell your B.O. unless you take a shower.  Just don't sell body spray packs in the Atom Store to counter-act the B.O.
---
Lol it’s not mostly bullshit, it was the most duped armor in the game. And everyone claiming to have it likely has the exact same pieces. Open up a trading sub, you’ll see.
---
Gimmie all the down votes! Feed me! 
---
Killed 27people with it easily just today. Before i survival i was easily killing people with 160damage hunting rifle.
---
250hp is starting pool, which is increased only with endurance. Damage rezistances are reduced by perks. Sneak multiply damage by 2.5x
---
Thats egouth damage for oneshoting without bethesda new thing to "fix" onshoting.
---
Listen if you find this horrible cash grab fun it just shows how much you let yourself be manipulated. It really worries me. Look man, don’t let these guys treat you like this. You deserve better. 
---
You really think repair kits are rebalancing the game? Come on, I barely ever need to repair and when I do I heave more than enough mats. It's not like they are selling two-shot explosive guns. While repair kits help they dont even go to 200% so I would never use them and they definately aren't rebalancing the game.  This whole thing is an over reaction and I'm in my 40s so not some young kid. 
---
This game is already on easy side.
---
Explosives it is then, maybe. That's in INT. MIRVs are probably the best, biggest aoe too
---
I said in my opinion and you took offense to it. That’s what happened. It’s good though. I’m not offended or mad at all. BECAUSE ITS A GAME. You seem to think I’m all about a TSE because I said I have some. Who doesn’t ? Feel free to assume what you want. 
---
I’m easy going. 
---
It was a hassle to make the ammo, but i remember it being pretty powerful if you shot quantum. Regular Nuka and Nuka Cherry were weak as shit but Quantum basically had the power of a fat man.
---
since you call our game "abuse". isn't your game dead? arena of valor? what even is that? looks like a knock-off dota 2. 
---
Well lets see our options.. we have this brutal experiment of gaming that leaves u scratching your head on the side of a west virginia mountainside and then there is the giant toilet of games. I agree that designing your own character can be difficult when ur used to teams of artists designing ur favorite characters and skins.  But can we tackle your biggest issue with this game.. which clearly is that it involves too much reading and thinking.
---
How can you find this fun ? 😟😟 It is one of most horrible games ever released. Don’t you read any news? You can’t find anything positive. This ain’t normal if you spend time on this willingly. These guys are playing you like a fiddle!!
---
*pulls out fat man*.
---
Kids: oh fook
---
Side answer: it depends on the stats you need for your build. Raider is my pick for my sniper, BOS for my low health melee. Marine for my power armor characters to look cool in when they craft.
---
been messing around and have edited in my new findings. Thanks for the help~
---
Sentinel assassin doesn’t stop you from dying easily, it has weaknesses just like anything else and they go down easy if you take advantage of those weaknesses. That being said, PA is weak to about everything, and SA has less than a handful of weaknesses, thus is greatly superior.
---
That’s such a good idea! I’m gonna do that when I get home. 
---
Then I’ll do it on Fallout 76. 
---
I am a leader and not a follower..I formulate my own opinions
---
I always roam with it level 1 so I never have to manually use stims. I’ll literally have never manually triggered a stun since I started the game lol.
---
I already did the brotherhood questline on one of my characters, but on my main (pvp char) I did not. Thats alright?
---
It doesn't cost as much to make games as it used to. Back then they had a ton of graphical restrictions, had to do things like "fog" to prevent rendering long distances.
---
Nowadays making a sequel in triple a is fairly concise. You already have the base mechanics code and engine done, you can reuse the nature assets and the like. and you dont have to concept mechanics and most character designs because it's the same characters.
---
Theres indie games with Triple A quality made by single people. It's not as unattainable as it seems, so the price of a full game being $60 plus another $40 plus season pass plus DLC plus consumables and MTX is ridiculous.
---
And you’re leading yourself to abuse 
---
I use it on all melee builds. Keep swinging through any combat encounter!
---
I’d keep crossbow as a rifle. I’d also lump them together and make them get stats off of the Ninja perk. 
---
As for arrow. I feel like explosive effect covers that. Flaming would be cool. Poison already exist. Albeit not in game to my knowledge, and anti armour just the tactical one well.  Drugged would be cool if the syringer didn’t exist. 
---
I’d love to go full ghoul 
---
Sorry dude, I think it’s just convenience and I want stuff in the atomic shop like this. I literally spend money on this and I think if it makes my personal game more fun without bothering you or affecting anyone else’s game play, then why wouldn’t you have it in? It’s silly to think there’s anger over this 
---
heres a guerrilla build i thought up.
---
I've been trying to Brief people on this game forever.. looks like someone beat me to it.
---
Actually it does, and no I'm not. I'm annoyed cause some call of duty reject that cant hack it in pvp wanted to be a dick. There were two of them, both with levels in the triple digits and bot using tse weapons. That was not simply taking my workshop. It was griefing or it would have been one person. Please get a life and stop blowing up my phone with your nonsense
---
Would be cool til someone reports you for sending a robot that calls someone a limp dick fat fucker
---
Where are you finding all the noobs getting 1 shotted by that dmg lol.
---
Idk man me and my bud both level 60 just tried to nuke for 3 hours unsuccessfully and ran out of supplies. 
---
I just remembered the palace of the winding path has one. But I doubt my low level would survive out there or even to the pioneer camp. Guess I’ll just check the bots for one. 
---
Hopefully the Wendigo up there didn’t give you too much trouble.
---
Wouldn't that be interesting. An IRL Pip-Boy from Zennimax Media. Nintendo cant even sue though cause the Switch aint a Switch-Boy.
---
I used it before I went in more of an Unyielding/Bloody direction.  It's pretty good for dealing with Colonel Gutsys who, in a group, can whittle down your health faster than you can use a Stimpack.  In combination with Field Surgeon, you can get past a group of them pretty easily.
---
Course, by that same token, Serendipity and Dodgy are great too.
---
Good points. Thanks for replying.
---
You’re so mad op just get over it’s a game, you’re a very upset person lmao 
---
😂😭😂😭😂😭😂
---
Yup that’s fine, as long as you can get a screenshot of the Completion and post it. Many of us have multiple characters 👍
---
Edited in everything I've done so far, and the wolves that occasionally spawn are kings of the wasteland.
---
With my turret and the world turret if ghouls/supers/scorched spawn in consistently the world tureet and a mob or two is dead.
---
If wolves spawn in, they all survive and both my turret and the world turret eat it.
---
Wolves are the Masters of the Universe.
---
AND REMOVIED BOIS WE DID IT!
---
😂 Only 100000 atoms.  Get grinding wastelanders!
---
Got smacked son lmao 
---
All I’m saying is , if you ruin 30 years of good will in 5 months ... something ain’t right 
---
Nice.
---
Thanks! Never expected to get it all for absolutely free. 
---
I had it early on and had an auto stim armor so i was going thru stims fast so i dropped it. Its a decent low level perk but if you stash your junk regularly you are better off just dying.
---
Just north of Sunday brothers cabin.
---
It’s not a opinion thing, it’s a numbers thing, which means it’s either fact or it isn’t, and the fact is bloodied blows tse out of the water, doing around 2.5x more dmg.
---
Isn’t the crossbow included in the rifleman perk? Explosive arrows would be brilliant.
---
This thread is entertaining..let's keep it going
---
You need to do this.. take everything u know and throw it away. make the opposite character of what you consider a good character and play that.     
---
While others are surprised that the whitespring and the lighthouse is real, I'm fucking MINDBLOWN that the MOTHMAN IS REAL!
---
No. It just really sad. 
---
Yeah I have tried that and that’s basically my suggestion is being able to add power armor to the favorites wheel as far as I can tell you can’t 
---
And imo running still sucks 🤷‍♂️😂
---
There is like close to 0 griefers in fo76, and people doing funny traps are actually awesome adding more content to the game. 
---
yeah lets find them and destroy all their bases.
---
Hopefully it's super hard. New enemies, etc
---
Saw him near harpers ferry and Charlestown station. 
---
Yes I would like this to be a thing....
---
Wow there are a lot of complete assholes here. Two losers with levels in the triple digits, who had just spawned into the map, head straight for my workshop, kill me with one shot, take it over, then one shot me again as soon as I spawn in ? Hmm, sounds a lot like griefing not some random player playing as normal. 
---
This single thing, no, but what it represents and what Bethesda will try to justify later, that will. Trying to make sure this doesn't come to pass is important for that long fight later on.
---
If you are fine with people later being able to buy super weapons and damage bonuses for cash, then you do you, but I won't sit and let it happen.
---
It's just the weapon and not the plan at Winding path isn't it?
---
And Winding Path is deserted, if the event isn't going. I would think a low level could get there without too much dying.
---
Played since the orignals in the 90s. I only manage a few hours a week but aside from launch a nuke which I'm not sure you can do solo I think I've done all the quests 
---
This is bout repair kits right...
---
Have fun getting wrecked in survival with your tse.
---
That is cheap and cheesy..an embarrassing way to play..they lack any type of real gameplay skills..if u see that happening just server hop
---
Yeah ..
---
How are they taking my money when I wouldn’t need the repair kits from the store or even the ones you can earn free in game, and if spending money on atoms to keep the game as a financially viable investment to keep the lights on then I shall 
---
I don't agree. But I won't downvote because it's not a repair kit post :P
---
You might consider pistols/commando as a backup weapon. Pistols weigh little and are easy to find/keep repaired. My fully specced pistol has longer range and accuracy than my rifle does, and as a bonus most people don't care about legendary pistols so they're easier to trade/buy
---
If you don't know, you can also pick it up for (if I remember right) pretty cheap from the doctor bot in the enclave bunker. 
---
No you completely misunderstood my argument. I think Bethesda will rebalance the game in order to sell more. Say like making your guns break quicker so that you run out of materials so fast you have to farm/grind to keep up. Basically the fact they sell them on the atom store gives them monetary incentive to change the game for the worse so you pay to fix the balance. 
---
I did, but it’s stupid that I have to stop what I’m doing to work around asshats
---
Or even look at the pip boy
---
Looks exciting and challenging. I remember seeing a Mirelurk Queen in the first trailer.
---
Hope you noticed I said I’m out of town until Sunday night. If you still want it then we’re good. If you find another before then, no worries. 
---
Super Mutants and Events
---
Ah yeah prestige system to work nicely
---
I'd love for them to snap to the defensive wall. Perhaps allow the defensive walls to be a little more forgiving on placement, as well. 
---
Happened to me once as well, never since. Probably best to just hop servers.
---
You have my support.
---
Get your mind out of the gutter
---
Use this forum to look for advice there is plenty of people capable of doing silo solo in less then 30 minutes with lvl 40 characters without using any glitches. Lowering difficulty is not a solution.
---
I would pay real money for some Enclave stuff
---
I don't think this is really a 'generational' example... your son is an 8 year old. I really doubt he has any deep conception of finances, monetary value, or ethical principles haha.
---
the opposite of what i know is not to play lol.
---
Mostly doing pvp, but how I see you guys doing no pvp.
---
Epic you should get an achievement for that 
---
let me guess.. youre on a console ?
---
What are mats?
---
Nice scam lol
---
Young People like your 8 years old son don't yet know the true value of money. If i buy a game for 60 hecking Bucks. I want to own the WHOLE Experience and not buy extra stuff later on with microtransactions.
---
Why is there a Atom Shop and why can you buy things with real money? Because it is a Online Game. Hell they even put such things in Fallout Shelter.... They don't want you to spend money on the Atom Shop because they need your Money to develop the Game even further, it's just a normal thing todo: Online Game? -&gt; ONLINE SHOP. Its just Extra Credits and pocket money for them.
---
SOLD! :D
---
yeah..last week these clowns destroyed my friends base..my friend killed one of them and then none of the other ones would fight back..so no pvp ensued..I thought it was so corny that they could destroy someone's base..but when it came time to fight they ran like little pansies ..there was this one time I was just adventuring somewhere outside of harpers ferry solo..and then I see a group of like 10 ppl..one of them starts hitting me and gets a bounty and if I fight back I obviously had no chance against 10..I was thinking..ur a tough guy with all ur buddies huh?
---
What is your IGN? :) 
---
Aren't people always complaining that the Crossbow is like a nerf gun?
---
The problem with crossbow as a rifle is that it shoot a projectile, with physics(correct me if I'm wrong), and is not a hit-scan weapon like all other rifles. 
---
I could be totally mistaken. I wish the game was more clear about how things work... but now that I'm thinking about it, it's like Beth doesn't even know how it all works, it just works. OMG that's the saying isn't it!?
---
Mats... Materials. Long time gaming terms
---
I don’t run TSE in survival 😂
---
I think having pre-set loadouts u can switch back and forth would be a better idea so u would just have to press a button to switch
---
I noticed. We're good. I mainly get to play on the weekends when I'm off work so I meant tomorrow. I'll just message you sometime tomorrow evening. I'm on EST.
---
If I remember it’s the weapon. Not sure if it’s level dependent or not. I forgot the event was there. I’ll look out for it. 
---
My main just hit 60. Up until 53...he wasnt a cannibal. Then Survival mode happened and he went straight zombie when he lost all his food and water. Still sporting a firebreathers outfit, but seemingly more monstrous every day.
---
&gt;and not buy extra stuff later on with microtransactions.
---
There's always new stuff they can add. It's not like a finite resource. Should they just not add any DLC or shop items?
---
Umm if I see fissure site is about to be nuked just fast travel there..u don't have to be in a team
---
Why did i instantly get a Downvote ?? 
---
He paid for it but didn't get it, there was another guy I was buying something for 9k and he forgot to do 9k, instead did 900 so I made sure I paid full price lol
---
Lolol. I just read the lyrics. This is why we can’t have nice things. 
---
Then again. We have the works of butcher Pete, and other dark tones. 
---
Reskinning an object is not as remotely difficult as you think. When you already have a pre-established texture, you simply have to work within the bounds of that texture, so reskinning is pretty trivial. Rather than it being about making the skin, it's more about what actually gets approved as a skin. The difficulty of the texture does change depending on what it's being used on though. At least the majority of the cosmetic apparel from the atom store are new models, and not reskins.
---
You're basing your complaint on an opinion that's presented as fact. You've even stated that we don't know if this was intentional or not. If that isn't "someone who is considered to be exaggerating a danger and so causing needless worry or panic," I don't know what to tell you. Just ask, instead of begging the question. 
---
I want both really, the more the merrier
---
It’s such a beautiful weapon to shoot, they had to ‘balance’ it with ludicrous bullet yields and low damage output. 
---
Thanks 
---
Get this to the top! Spread the knowledge!
---
Don't believe him it's safe, nobody wants to hurt people who want repair kits.. in fact he needs to share the repair kits cause he says he bought them but he has nothing left to repair!
---
The market is constantly growing, more now than ever. Games used to be much more expensive. Adjusting for inflation, many of the systems were too. But they cost more to make because they have voice acting, quality animations, graphics that rely on huge teams to produce, and worlds a hundred times as large as the first few generations of games, and then once you've got all that, you've got quality control that has probably become an absolute nightmare.
---
Whichever ur build..max the cards out..there's at least 9 points total (non-auto, auto, shotgun, etc)
---
You literally don't have to buy anything, no matter how cool or useful it is.
---
Yes, and I can have a Han Solo vs Gredo moment
---
dude fuck yea i love this. I live in WV and was thinking about doing something similar but, alas, the travel lol
---
Was that supposed to be Starched Genes rather than Class Freak?
---
I'd recommend dropping a lot of points from Int in favour of Luck. Bloody Mess is really good for a two weapon class build. Luck of the Draw is probably better per point than Gunsmith + Makeshift Warrior for weapon condition, although the best way to reduce repair costs is just to abuse stealth.
---
Blocker is normally preferred to Barbarian.
---
Stop bringing up points that: a) make sense b) are factually based and c) undercut the incredibly weak premise the OP espoused. How are we supposed to be enraged when we have nothing about which to be angry?
---
We have members that do engage in PvP, we just haven’t found any other servers willing to do organized PvP. That and the missions we post are PvE. Sometimes we get together and hop into survival as well but at this moment no points are awarded for killing people. Our values and close to that of elder Lyons from Fo3 (I know we come before his time) but we don’t aim to kill people only eradicate the abominations of the waste and preserve tech 
---
I thought it was the Meat Hook that got both benefits?
---
Exactly what I was thinking
---
I know what you mean.. when u say play you refer to shooting heads till they are dead.. well I have just the character idea for you.. the unarmed pacifist.. never pick up weapons and get through the game without killing a single enemy.
---
The prices are way out of wack, so are the atom rewards though. Both need to be axed.
---
COD wwii has a snake skin camo for the MG42 that’s simply gorgeous. Those devs at Bethesda could really learn a few things or two just by playing it for a while. 
---
I can't wait. Gonna be badass. Anyone looking for a group when it drops my GT on XBone is MrBojeezy. Lvl 94 sniper/shotgun build
---
Personally, I have no issues with this. It will make my personal gameplay much easier and more enjoyable not always having to worry about my armor/weapon condition, and not worrying about having my main weapon break in the middle of a quest/event. I understand people have there own stance on this and that many of you may disagree, and that is fine, I respect your opinions and understand your arguments. But like I said, this will make my game more enjoyable, and I’m sure others will agree with me. 
---
Sent you request, XSlamxHammerX
---
TIL as a 35 year old gamer.....I'm old
---
California... basically been done in 1 and 2. I would love to see a more realistic sized world of around where I live, because, why not?
---
We have a few local legends like the Proctor Valley Monster. There were also rumors of a cult back in the day. If it focused on just the county region, then it would have a nice mix of urban, country, desert, military facilities, etc.
---
But I don't have much hope in Bethesda ever getting close to here since they want to stay away from the west coast and not mess with Fallout 1 and 2 areas.
---
no probs. I will message you when online. just doing update 
---
I always joke that they got the roads and broken down trailer's beside the road so accurate haha
---
Hahaha
---
Yer I haven't seen any yet
---
No one is forcing you to buy anything.
---
Legendary enemies in general do that. I've had robots do it...
---
Makes me wonder if the devs should release a roadmap for how they are planning to pay for costs of the game so we the players can have some input into that...now maybe that's a can of worms that just popped open...actually...I like the idea...I think it would give us a better context for these types of conversations and we may come up with some really creative solutions that help the devs with their goals and us with ours....it's like the elephant in the room and neither us or the devs are talking about it in a way that the two groups in the conversation can have a really meaningful dialogue. If the devs show no interest it may mean that their main interest is to take us much money off the table for as little effort as possible...sounds like out of control capitalism to me...and this is what they have been doing for a while from what I understand...thus the community concern.
---
Good deal
---
It’s irrelevant what you run, based on what you know, you are definitely terrible at this game.
---
I preferred subscription , it cuts out all the players that were not really into the game and keeps the dedicated players.
---
It's funny how great those paper bag drops can be!
---
Lets do this guys. we will setup a camp at whitesprings and we will give free repair kits to everyone that comes..  course repair kits don't exist yet so bullets will have to do.. 
---
Where my Brothers Of The Moth at?
---
I agree....but only "short" weapons should be allowed.  (can't fully shoulder a long gun, and definitely no heavies, from a chair).  Short Hunting Rifle, Single Action, Lever Action, etc.  Or any pistol/revolver.  
---
Truthfully, there's absolutely no reason at all in any world (other than lazy coding reasons) that we can't access the pip boy while seated.  Please give us this as well.
---
Make train stations and vault 76 safe zones or put a time limit after spawning when fast traveling before other players can inflict damage to you, also you won't be able to inflict damage to enemy players until the time limit is up. This way we can get rid of those pesky campers that kill players before they can even defend themselves.
---
I had a group doing this and after they attacked my camp I waited till they were distracted and grouped up to counter with a assassins fatman with a limb damage addition with a MIRV on it.... one shot was all it took to kill or cripple the second shot finished it.
---
Sounds like you weren’t strong enough to own the workshop 
---
No it's not griefing in this instance.  You took over a consensual pvp area and you died.
---
You are lower level and higher levels took you out in a pvp zone.
---
You're missing the point that it's a pvp zone. It doesn't matter if you got killed multiple times, it doesn't matter they are a higher level, it doesn't matter because it was a PVP zone.
---
Sorry but it's working as designed and intended.
---
I like this too. I'm kinda hoping it eventually tricks someone into hitting me so I can powerfist them to death and get them caps. 
---
But with the OP jump-and-two-shot strat, my PvP skills definitely need work.
---
Bulk individual crafting already causes strain on the server though! In fact a few patches ago that added a delay to prevent crafting items too quickly due to it causing instability.
---
I wouldn't think a slide that changes the (Wood x 1 + Dirty Water x 2 = Boiled Water x 1) to (Wood x 25 + Dirty Water x 50 = Boiled Water x 25) to be more stressful to the server the doing the simple calculation 25 times. Wouldn't it be like calculate the requirements, verify the player has the required materials, calculate perk bonuses, then craft all?
---
Holy sheeet that’s a lot of loss. I lost quite a few legendary items too while transferring stuff between accounts due to server crash. Many non-issue in other games are a major pain in the a$$ with Fo76. 
---
There are pets??
---
I said the same thing just last night.
---
I’m pretty much fed up, shame 
---
This is something for the Future i guess. Will you still play this game in the future? What happens to the game in 3 Years? Does the Content actually change over time and so its pleasurment level? Or will they stop that because the world is already packed and only focus on Cosmetic stuff? We don't know that for sure, but we know it's going to get much slower. This year we are getting content they couldn't add in the first place, because of time. Next year this is going to get much slower and so on xD I hope you get where i want to put that little pessimistic point. 
---
People aready freak out because a litte repair kit thing, before it even came into the game, i dont want so see how they freak out, when they check they are going to get less and less true quality content.
---
Topic: Youngsters still gonna play and grind them Atoms to buy everything they want, but us Oldies? We will grow out of this shit loop and thats nothing anyone can change :) 
---
PA has always sucked in PvP, not just since survival beta was released.
---
Yeah man, karma totally exists. That's why if someone escapes from north korea their whole extended family gets tortured and killed, because they were naughty and left when they weren't supposed to. Children get cancer because they deserve it, not because life is random and doesn't give a shit, but because life gives so much of a shit that it gets even with them for being rude to grandma that one time!
---
Love hearing players like this 👍🙌
---
I think Hard Lemonade gave me lowered AP and AP regen after it expired. I haven't really used any of the alcohols since im missing most recipes.
---
No joke. I live in WV and they have been working on my ditch for weeks. Not the terrible road... just the ditch. I have a pretty nice ditch now. I guess there’s always that. 
---
It would also be nice to have crew served weapons.  Screw Automated Turrets.  I want a thing that I can place down (camp/workshop only) Which comes with its own internal (either infinite or with a resupply that happens when you repair it) ammo stock and its a freaking Chain Gun, or something like that.    
---
Hell make it a "Heavy Weapons Mount", even if I have to use my own ammo for it and the weapon still takes up stash space.  It would still give me a reason to hold onto a really nice Gatling or Mini gun, or .50, or LMG, etc etc...  For someone who isn't a heavy weapons guy, that would still be pretty dang fun.  
---
I would actually buy something like this out of the Atom shop if they sold it.  3000 atoms for a Camp Placed "Heavy Weapon Mount".  F-  Yes.  Sign me up!!!
---
Just looking to help 😊.  Got a couple people I’m helping with a nuke 
---
8 hours north? Ontario?
---
I want to Han Solo some Greedo in a bar. 
---
After that I only transfer a couple of items at a time. It’s slower but at least the loss is limited if sheeet happens again. 
---
Yeah I know that but I‘m looking for people I can play with on a regular base. Just doing the queen is not my priority.
---
I bet you’re a joy to be around irl. 
---
Based off your comments I bet eating bags of dicks is a regular thing for you. 
---
But anyway because I don’t enjoy running the bloodied build I suck 😂 
---
Fuck outta here.
---
Being able to defend your camp would have a purpose. PvP against other players has a purpose. Randomly destroying things has no purpose. If you want to just randomly destroy things for no reason and with no challenge so you can claim you're a raider then ok. You've answered my question.
---
I do the same 👍 GT KnowledgeHound if you need a hand helping ... I guess? 😂
---
I got my free repair kit in survival mode ;) 
---
No....I now want this! I want to roam Survival and help fellow vault dwellers randomly discover new locations, for free!! 
---
Yes. What does that change?
---
Who cares. No one with a repair kit is going to have an advantage over me. It’s not weapons we’re talking about. 
---
Actually they're right. 
---
The game gives you a message before you agree to claim the workshop that other players can try to claim the workshop from you, which is PvP. By claiming it, you are consenting to PvP.
---
As for there being two of them, that's part of the game as well. They were just in a team.
---
Why do you need skins for raider PA? The original rusty one is the look you want right? 
---
You keep changing your story and argument, not exactly a joy to talk to yourself there chump.
---
No you suck because you can’t do math, there’s a difference between that and what you said.
---
It’s actually a town. White Sulphur Springs. The resort is The Greenbrier. 
---
It does not. I believe sneak attack boosts are disabled all together.
---
Just remember Cole Porter kept singing about how anything goes in that era, so it's very possible.
---
People filthy in the 40s too. 
---
Cool man what's your games tag?
---
Yep... You need animal friend rank 3 and a lone creature to spawn at a random spawn.
---
I found both cat and dog along the road heading south from Abby's bunker.. Just past the tree that spawns wendingos :)
---
Its fixed now , i only use the tse version tho Idk how the regulsr is 
---
Just saying it would be a fix to people who don’t like to get instantly killed
---
An I the only one that is reminded of the Futurama episode where Fry gets committed to the robot asylum, then gets put into the tiny room with Roberto? 
---
I'll message you! See you there
---
I agree 100%. The part about the other vendors not being happy is for the fucking birds.
---
This is good. 
---
Because it costs atoms to put your camp there.
---
That’s awesome
---
I have a faster fire rate two shot and I can never go back to a regular one 
---
Good edit that’s how you should’ve asked the question in the first place. Ain’t nobody here was invested in hating on you but a question like the one you originally asked was phrased in a hating way. You stated that no one had ever asked for these changes and you were wrong, we enlightened you, end of story.
---
I like the Vault Tec workshop dlc in 4 it be cool having to rebuild your own vault.
---
If they posted what the issues they were having were I might be more sympathetic. I don't want another broken thing in the game but seriously what's the problem, all the mechanics are already in game!! 
---
So lets say they introduce the kits. Then periodically they increase your wear by 5% or say fuck it and straight half it as a balance. Next why not reduce xp by 50% and introduce 24hr double xp packs. Ammo bundles for sale!
---
Damn it! I'm at work. Get a shot in for me. 
---
So the initial purchase is irrelevant?
---
I have a PA/heavy+melee main and a non-PA/rifle build..... The amount of legendaries and ammo lost between the two saddens me.... I feel your pain
---
This feels like a trap
---
Do you need a hug?
---
I approve of this message.. Todd make this happen dude.
---
I have 2 friends that I played F76 a lot with when it first came out. They're both in their 30s and I'm 24. They both bought a bunch of stuff from the Atom shop and I, the younger gamer, thought it was dumb. The only way I'd buy anything from the Atom shop was if I saved up the atoms. That way I had a sense of accomplishment.
---
It would be more awesome with some turrets at all train stations a faction security measurement. Someone has is weapon up and flags himself as red? Turrets shot em, even if he is stealth etc.
---
you know, when you word it that way the MTX sounds a lot like an STD...
---
Cool pics.  I've been meaning to do something similar.  I live just outside of Charleston, so I have no excuse except for laziness.
---
BTW there's a painting of the Thurmond train station in the game.
---
I feel bad for your parents lol
---
I posted that comment 135 days ago idk how many updates this game has had since
---
Got your back bro, have one!
---
Sell legendaries to players / get the civil war hat plan and max out vendors daily with crafted hats (you'll be at your goal in 3 days) / sell drugs to vendors
---
Quite a few places are very off. Some are generally ok but not super accurately placed. 
---
So like. There's no fix tho? Just happened to me, did all the fragments, was sent to Charleston, crashes, now it's making me redo Blackwater fragment, reloaded many times and yep did Blackwater wants me to go to trapper
---
Imagine how you'd feel when your vending machine ate your TSE. Or sold it for nothing. Or allowed someone to dupe it. Or some other god awful bug you know they are working out. Relax.
---
The only thing I'm worried about the "p2w" thing is how many players we're going to lose and how many people are going to hate it now. 
---
To be fair we’ve seen weirder. 
---
It’s true! He just gave me a bunch and told me to tell my friends. 
---
from what i remember, it was mainly just being being able to find/craft them, or buy them from venders, or for them to be added to the loot pool for some events. 
---
certainly not for them to be added to the atom shop. 
---
But... Power armor is a thing? It's not a problem tbh lll
---
Most likely laggy/inconsistent servers. One time I traded with my friend for a rare apparel so I could use it on my second character. I even put it on and a minute later got a server disconnect and the apparel was nowhere to be found. 
---
That’s not even close to what “buyer’s remorse” means.
---
Implying they have any respect for the lore
---
That basically why i play it
---
I'll at first I didn't even notice there were differences till I looked harder....
---
Now I *Need* those nicer looking railings
---
its so cute.. \*kisses\*
---
If you havn't found it yet. its on the map screen, not the pipboy.  
---
Top right corner when looking at the map..
---
Everytime people make threads about these issues, its on consoles. I mean.. you can kinda guess what community youre getting from picking up games on a console. 
---
Oh god don't tell anyone that, they'll start crying about fucking nothing some more...
---
 U can add astraios89 
---
29 years and lvl 170+
---
No not changing my story. 
---
I said the TSE was a problem from the start. Early game. 
---
And told the op what may have happened to him in survival as it’s pretty common. 
---
I also said I’ve ran a bloodied and didn’t enjoy it. Granted I didn’t use sent/ass at the time with it. But that build is not how I play. I do have that now.
---
Hence for me “ running it sucks” and “imo”  nothing about numbers as it’s fucking obvious to anyone with a brain that you can do hella damage. I EVEN SAID AAE AND BLOODIED are hot right now.
---
You got aggressive  and triggered right away. Literally called me pathetic and whining because I don’t agree with you.  And I wasn’t the only one.
---
I have AAE,stealth build, and tse . Same thing I said from the start. 
---
My last comment to you either way. Toxic ass dude.
---
I’m fine with them pushing it back a week if it gives them the time to hammer out potential bugs or exploits.
---
Sorry, "a feeling of regret experienced after making a purchase, typically one regarded as unnecessary or extravagant". After the dozens of controversies of this game and Todd Howard's lies and lies people are still playing it because they can't handle they wasted money on this lmao
---
The mound the town is named after is worth swinging by for a couple minutes. It’s right across the street from the prison. 
---
Yes the prison is literally sitting on sacred Indian burial grounds lol. 
---
Yeah I felt pretty bad when my friend found the robot called me over then my Plague walker made it agro thus making it unable to trade luckily he found it again and I used rad-x but he had bad trades ;(
---
He's just patting himself on the back for getting around the auto mod lol let the dummy win one
---
They bitched when the game was delayed.
---
They bitched when it was released.
---
Then they bitched when people looked to exploit the core of the game, to the point sales suffered. They bitched when the bag they bought was the wrong material. 
---
They bitched about PVP.
---
Now its food spoilage and repair kits.
---
Wtf.
---
I love the game and play it every chance I get free. Play the game as it's meant to be played and not spending hours on trying to use exploits to gain an advantage. 
---
Damn people must lead either awful idyllic lives where everything goes as planned, or have way too much time on their hands and feel the need to complain.
---
Don't want to buy a repair kit? Then don't buy one.
---
Interesting that Fallout 76 is real. Sometimes people don't give it enough credit
---
They are combining the vendor cap pools as well. So you will be able to sell your 1400 caps worth of tactical marine helmets in one place. No need to go to whitesprings.
---
Yeah it’s not in the atom shop yet but it’s been in the stairs category for ages. Since the start of wildappalachia 
---
I'm pretty confused about the method you used to do this. Are you on a team and that's how you get back to the same server? They got disconnected at the worst possible time while you were switching? If so why wouldn't you just trade with a friend and have them hold onto your stuff? Why would anyone drop loot in a box and expect it to still be there?
---
I think there is another, more damaging, envromental factor affecting the mirelurks. I think plastic doesnt bother them anymore.
---
I'm amazed by how close the fan and hot plate you found are to in game models. Can we get details on those? Make/model/year of production, etc?
---
Every single ghost hunting show has done a piece on it at this point I think. You can YouTube a lot of stuff too I’m sure. Trans Allegheny Lunatic Asylum or TALA should get you the results. 
---
Why would someone point a neon arrow light sign pointed at a spiked pit trap?
---
Let me know when you get on, IGN is Knight\_Wanderer. Added you.
---
The repair costs for the shower are absolutely insane. You already have to earn the plan and gather a bunch of flux to craft it, simply repairing it shouldn't be such a task.
---
Damn I was hoping you were going to say it does but just doesn’t register 
---
Youngster! Everything will change when you turn 45 (like me) ;) 
---
We don't know how they are going to implement the ''Legendary Players'' thing. But i assume it will be the same like in Skyrim i guess. Just with more Powerful Perk Card Stats and so on.
---
That’s honestly a great idea!
---
Just shhhhhh. They have ears everywhere!
---
Funny.   For your next English lesson, will you teach us about possessive nouns?
---
I added three people with public profiles, one added me back. Joined the game back and the server dies. RIP. 
---
It's actually *buyer's remorse*, not *buyers remorse.*  And no, that's not what it means.  
---
You’re taking what I was saying in a different way. But yes, reading through your comment, it sounds like you’re bitching. 
---
Oooh I had no idea, stairs are the bane of my builder existence and I avoid them like the plague.
---
Veil of Secrets, a quest item, also does not lower perception by 2 and protects against airborne disease.  It's also doubly awesome because you can mix it with your own choice of headwear.
---
I wear [it](https://i.imgur.com/CUjJfAj.png) with bottlecap sunglasses and the Fasnacht beret.
---
We're mad that the VP of the company promised shit like this would not happen, and now it's happening. 
---
Why is that so hard to grasp? 
---
It's not "oh wow this specific item is to OP". It isn't. It's that this _class_ of item shouldn't exist at all as real money purchasable items, based on promises made by the company
---
Its to start brining notice of it. If we wait the full 6 months and then start brining the conversation up, then we will have to wait another few months for them to do something. We need people to start talking about the subject of it again to have Bethesda post a update on it for us all. Sitting in silence doesn't help issues get solved.
---
Got ya added. I'm working on transferring over the junk acquired on the last run and will be looking for 2 more recruits. I see you're on now, so if you have time, I'll see you shortly.
---
That statue has been humped in more Instagram photos than you can imagine. 
---
I still Adhesive farm (corn/mutfruit/tato) with Green Thumb card (Hard Bargain card doesn't hurt, either). Cook into vegetable starch, bulk the adhesive, and rain in caps. Tatoes and mutfruit are typically worth more caps to vendors than corn, so feel free to plant more of them if you ever have excess.
---
Honestly, if you are griefing others and have a massive bounty, I am going to level your camp. I'll keep leveling it too. Too many people are here to play the game for relaxation. They don't need to deal with the HEERRRRRR IM RP AS RAIDERRRR.  
---
If you build anywhere that interferes with the spawns and farming and general flow of whitesprings, your base needs to be destroyed. You don't get xp from turrents when you are away from your base. So why set it up there and ruin the farm for others?
---
That's fine, I'll be on tomorrow as well.
---
Jez is that good, he's talented and that's coming from someone with a couple degrees in digital design.
---
Oh Son... what have you done. Hell is goin lose! You really want to see the Appalachia burn to Ash this time.
---
At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.
---
&gt;  humans are boring people that most unfun people would choose.

wow thats rude, fair, but rude

You should have just traded with someone! This was all preventable.
---
You know, my guide actually told us a story about some sort of “demon” or creature up there
---
Bethesda should have basic quality of life designs in place...
---
I like this better. I don't want to restart just to become more powerful. 
---
No kidding! Two bucks says they don't show...
---
once those ones are done though you limited to a few hundred a week

Already happened to food

There will be food and water supplied

The FO76 version of "Old Man Mose" (1938) was the first time the word "fuck" was used in a commercially successful song.

(Although not the first time it was used in a song that was released publicly)

The fucker loves hunting down foxes for some odd reason

😂 👌

...I thought this was going to be a dungeons of dredmor reference, and I am sadly disappointed. 
---
To watch the world burn.

call it what you want,  pay to win,  pay 4 convenience, pay for whatever,   its still paying for non cosmetics

👍🏻

Surprised you didn’t hit up Helvetia. 
---
The circular draw things in the reporter building in Charleston have some technical data sheets for responders who don't want to search too far from home.  
---
I’ve been wanting that same set, what does the chest piece with the buttressed mod look like? There’s a specific raider chest piece I saw &amp; I loved the look of it, it looked like it had a crown of rebar poking off the top
---
Hmm I don't think random loot helps to any awareness.
---
Are you familiar with how certain mirelurk have fishing webs stucks onto them? I don't know if that model is in Fallout 76 but since nearly everything else is, it should too.
---
The funny thing is half these anti atom shop people bought the game on half price or lower. And go mental. I bought the game when it first came out for full price and I acctually don’t mind the atom shop and it’s contents and have bought from it many a times. And tbh there’s nothing wrong with paying for bonus content as we are getting the dlc for free! Rant over lol
---
Hey Han Solo, is that the dog that was stuck up on the rocks above Harper's Ferry with his previous owners?
---
No kidding. Two bucks says they don't show...
---
Ah, I'm on PC. That message has never shown. Well I hope it gets fixed for you.
---
If I'm remembering correctly, you could buy the clean water purifier in the Atom Shop right when you step outta the vault. PAY TO WIN PAY TO WIN PAY TO WIN
---
I don't know if it is so much about a generation gap as it is understanding the value of money. Most kids don't care or don't understand the value of money. I'm 30, and when I was a kid, I would go grocery shopping with my mom, and everytime I would go to the Electronics area of Walmart or whatever and try to convince her to buy a new game for me. I didn't understand at the time that spending that much on a new game every week or 2 was a pretty big waste of money, especially since the quality of games 20 years ago were all over the place. 
---
TL:DR kids have less concern about money, doesn't matter if there is an in game shop or not
---
Devs spend 100-200 million making video game.
---
Devs sell at least12 mill copies make bank 
---
Devs charge sub for content cut to time restraints
---
Most people pay for it because it looks good
---
Devs decide hey fortnite does well we were working on multi anyway
---
Players hype train it and preorder the hell out of it
---
Devs never polish the game
---
Players say this is fine its only beta.
---
Devs try to survive on microtransactions
---
Players take 2 scoops but complain it tastes bad.
---
Devs listen oh no shia surprise
---
Devs go to caymen island bank
---
Players still playing till 2 am.
---
Devs come back oh shit your still here...posts the number 5 on a website.
---
Theres a certain point where maybe some people are tired of the price gouging in their leisure gaming.
---
If 5 has scaled transcations akin to 76 then yeah gaming has become a rich persons game. Though it would explain why over 70-80% of americans go paycheck to paycheck.
---
Aha, that would do some work haha
---
Also the desks in the military wing of the enclave have a lot of technical data. 
---
It's not a week it's 5 weeks till the next patch 
---
I mean, you're not the only one disappointed. I am too. But I'm find with it being pushed back so they can work on it some more. If they'd have put it out and some massive problem was in it, people, maybe even you, would have moaned about it. They're in a no-win situation.
---
&gt; they can't handle they wasted money on this
---
Oh, sixty bucks.  Oh no, I can't handle the thought of wasting sixty whole dollars.  Yes, I need to cocoon myself in self-deception in order to psychologically cope with the lost of sixty dollars.  
---
How am I going to explain to my fiance that we're going to lose the house now?  We're going to have to sell all three cars and get rid of the pets.  We'll be homeless.  All because I had to spend sixty dollars on this video game that's p2w now.  Oh, the humanity!  Why did I do this to myself?  
---
How much for the excavator
---
Sorry to disappoint. 
---
I store it now when I’m not there. Shame I can’t leave it down for other players. 
---
Yeh like it won't be full of bugs anyway 
---
I fucking love the BL series.  Played all 3 multiple times through.  I am going to love 3, but I'm with you.  I feel like the public is going to sour on that game on release day.  Between Epic exclusivity and just an updated engine of previous Borderlands I think you will see a lot of people calling it lazy.  Especially considering the amount of time Gearbox has between releases.
---
I'm going to fucking love it.  I like the mechanics and gameplay loops of the previous 3, so more of the same plus new systems is fine with me.  I even loved the presequel and didn't mind the low grab at all.  But I don't think the general public is gonna be happy.
---
This idea could honestly add a ton of fun misadventures and pranks and grief, like imagine wise guy shooting everyone with nukashine a minute before the SBQ goes down. Everyone would just disappear right before getting to loot her, screaming in agony
---
The higher the level, the more caps you get. If you killed me, you'd get 139 caps. If you killed my friend, you'd get 52.
---
I've got a similar issue, I'm supposed to drink wine and then get a ranged attack. No attack I've tried has worked. In sneak, out of sneak, with a variety of weapons. I even tried throwing hatchets to see if that would work, nothing. I've gone through 6 bottles of wine and killed dozens of things. 
---
It would help, but given the problems with duping I wouldn't hold your breath. You shouldn't drop valuable gear to swap between alts. That just sounds like a bad idea.
---
The amount of backlash they get for sending out an unfinished product and now they get hate for trying to fix something that may take a little while. Leave the damn devs alone
---
I have time! Should I join you or do you invite/join me? :) 
---
The clean spacesuit helmet can be found in-game as well. I found mine on the table at the Sons of Dane compound...
---
Well, maybe it was a sign to not play a game with so many problems. 
---
The heavy has pipes surrounding the head, I believe the sturdy variant is the one that looks like you're describing
---
There not in a no win situation at all!! Don't sat a release date untill your sure it's working. That's what got them all the negative press anyway. Todd even said it himself. 
---
You don't set a release date on something if your still working in it. It's poor business practice 
---
I’m still okay with that.
---
Disappointed, but okay.
---
Yeah maybe, feel free to drop more loot if you're on the way out. ;)
---
No, go away
---
Absolutely. The more varied and flexible the in game economy is, the better player vending will fare. 
---
You’ve intrigued me. 
---
Only creatures spawned at random spawn points can be tamed and only if they spawn by themselves. So that deathclaw fighting super mutants can't be tamed. That deathclaw that is always in the same spot can't be tamed. 
---
It's hard to find a pet. Most creatures you find cant be tamed. Try heading north from abbies bunker, past the honey beasts, until you find a pond with a crashed certified in the middle. It's actually closer to the northern most fissure site than abbies place. That's where I go for pets.
---
Sturdy raider chest will have a base defense (unmodded) of 54/19 so look for that 👍
---
Are you serious! As I said to someone else. If it's  it fully working then don't set a release date. It's very poor business practice to push something back. Americans think it's ok but the rest of the world find it very unprofessional 
---
I don't know how to check that. If it's the stars behind the name, it's one.
---
The primary reason is because there's no valid place to land on the target she's aggro'ed on. They're all by dropsite v-9 the player she's aggro'ed on is atop a building or fence, a no land zone.
---
Wouldn’t barbarian be better since it’s a damage resist from everything compared to the just less damage from melee when using blockers?
---
And why starched genes? I chose class freak since I was thinking maybe I could use a mutation with reduced negative effect.
---
What should the minimum be for int then since you suggest that I invest more points into luck?
---
Hey anyone had "keys to the past" reset on them? Got to where it wants me to go to Charleston to investigate the body location, then sends me back to finding the first of the raider keys, the Blackwater mine, and no matter how many reloads it won't fix, so, optimistic, get to do the XP and loot again, pessimistic, that was quite a few hours that as a close to 30 years old gamer I don't have many of
---
I was stationed West Virginia from 98 to 01.  Brings back fond memories..
---
Thats pretty cool, I've never noticed those paintings before. I may be wrong, but I think the train station painting on the far right is the old Norfolk and Western train station at Kenova, WV.
---
What did he drop thooo 
---
This is why developers hate giving people dates as far as when something will be finished.  They are not clairvoyant.  They don't know when it'll be ready.  They make an estimate.  Sometimes shit happens.  They run into unexpected problems and suddenly the end date that was pulled out of someone's ass is no longer viable.
---
It's always better to be correct than to be on-time.  If it needs more time to develop, it is what it is.  
---
Have not been able to find that spot. 
---
Gonna look for this when I get on today 
---
His insults are legen.... wait for it..... dary!
---
When I played, my room mates commented on how good they game looked.  Then it would crash and they would say, "definitely not buying that."
---
Game looks great, they should it left it in the oven for another year and brought a really polished game out.  They would have avoided so much backlash just by working out the multiple crash issue.
---
Thankyou, was about to say. There whole argument is completely moot. It's an obtainable item, I have like 3
---
Make an offer for the pair.
---
How about custom made items...made to order...they give us some software that is easy to use...like creation club and players create what they want (this eliminates Dev cost of design) the player uploads file of the cosmetic item...some vetting takes place and then it gets sold in the store for a reasonable price.
---
Exactly, this. And it doesn't look goofy either. 
---
Any luck with albino deathclaw? Have not been able to tame one but the normal ones are no problem. 
---
Probably at the local game shop they tend to have moved to merch now that people buy games online
---
Very cool!
---
A mini gun mounted to a front porch railing would be awesome.
---
It's on the highway west of big b's and north of treetops
---
For me he dropped a 3* L45 trapper leg with -15% ghoul damage, +1 INT, and Junk weight down 20%.
---
Wife got a 1* 10mm super mutant dmg pistol.
---
i'll be on in 30 mins, and I got to do my shop run, so how bout 1.5k? it's not the plan rights, if it's not then 1.5k.
---
Couldn't agree more. When I'm really bored I'll talk shit in all the 'Dear Bethesda' posts. 
---
Damn
---
Its doable once again you need to be double its lv and have lv3 animal friend. So far I'm still too low to tame one 
---
I’m from Britain lol. I can understand the anger for it so maybe they should have put a disclaimer at the bottom saying “subject to change” but some bugs only show themselves with different patches. A little like the robot hacking perk and the vendors when you couldn’t trade with them because it thought you were hacking them. Certain conditions create certain problems and it’s better to fix them and risk annoying people than to send the product out and have complaints roll in. Thanks for reading if you got this far
---
In all honesty I feel like humans would just be the balanced character they are in every mmo. 
---
I'm not unhappy with what Fallout 76 is but, the idea I had would be soo cool and they could have used some of that ESO smarts to make it happen.
---
Very awesome 
---
Pretty sure the venders near the top of the world sell it
---
Mr Kool-aid / bomberman. Wear red nuka cola or quantum painted PA, charge through enemies, drop mines behind you.
---
You actually believe that?

Shit post flavor
---
I still think their best job was with Washington DC
---
They'll be there. [https://bethesda.net/en/article/qC1LRtaTkKh25EaQXsKaI/save-the-date-be3-returns-june-9](https://bethesda.net/en/article/qC1LRtaTkKh25EaQXsKaI/save-the-date-be3-returns-june-9)
---
Yep 2 mods, both  for excavator calibrated shocks
---
Me too. I own a 1 storey garage that contains all my crafting and a bedroom 
---
&gt; But I don't have much hope in Bethesda ever getting close to here since they want to stay away from the west coast and not mess with Fallout 1 and 2 areas.
---
Which is a shame I'd love to explore the west coast on modern systems
---
I'm sorry but that's bullshit. If they are professional developers which I have to assume they are they they should be perfectly capable giving themselves a nice wide buffer on the date. If they have done that which again I have to assume they would have then it's a joke.
---
Their paid to understand the game. If you know a out game engines then you would know it's not like the real world where anything can happen? it works on fixed rules and code that they should know inside and out and be able to anticipate issues.
---
Would you go to a surgeon who said, well I think it will be ok, I'm not sure though as anything can happen...no you would go to the one who knows what he is doing 
---
so 1.5k? right, I have no idea about trade prices. sorry for spamming reddit. 
---
Mach ich! Bin morgen wieder am Start 👍🏻
---
First, it's she, not to be rude. And second, I only say that because every YouTube I come across say the same thing. 3 fissure sites.

Try this instead:

* Blocker is better than Barbarian by lots.
---
* You don’t need that much Adrenaline. You could even take more off if you want, but I want to leave you room for some swaps (like White Knight, Ammosmith).
---
* May as well get Class Freak and Starched Genes high.
---
* Concentrated Fire is very solid.
---
* I get the “extra health” perk, but I think you’ll find Fireproof quite useful for negating boomy damage. Sun Kissed is great at PVE rad management. You’ll still need to carry Rad-Away for nuke zones / touchy situations.
---
* You don’t need both Makeshift and Gunsmith on all the time. Once you get Weapon Artisan, you don’t need to keep either one equipped generally.
---
* I put a point in Tenderizer - it’s not needed for most smaller things, but handy in fights against big things (queen).
---
Essentially, the game is a couple of scenarios, and the two you want to think about most are “mass of medium tough mobs that you could kill easily but if they swap you you’re in trouble” and “big boss monster” interspersed with “walk around, explore, sell, etc.”  Think about that as you plan.
---
I agree completely. 
---
I'm actually really pissed off that I just recently (only two days before Repair Kits were announced) bought a 4000 (but really 5000) atom pack for myself and one for my girlfriend who really likes a lot of things in the atomic shop. I like costumes and weapon and armor paints, she likes CAMP skins and decorations. We're both people who would gladly drop down money on the store for cosmetics we want, but only cosmetics not utility. 
---
Until I heard about this I was genuinely considering getting another pack soon and buying the two new bundles that seem "somewhat" reasonably priced, now I really don't know if I will even keep playing if this is the direction Bethesda thinks the game should go. C'mon Bethesda, I really want to support this game and for it to have a future, don't fuck it up.
---
Be honest and straight forward with your fans, deliver on the game people paid for and sell lots of cool skins and cosmetics to keep everything running and delivering new content, it's pretty simple and it's worked out great for a lot of games.
---
I just like sitting in chairs. Yes, I'm getting older and my gaming reflects life, but I do like grabbing benches and chairs in game. While waiting at a vendor or foraging at an ice cream parlor..it's just nice to let your character take a load off. Now, along those lines I'd really like fishing sometime too.
---
I think it's more of having much less concepts of work, value of work, value of $$ in exchange for work...etc.  I know people's kids who thought if you don't have enough $$$ to buy something then just go to an automated teller machine and they just give you what they want....lol
---
I think perhaps with a future DLC it would be cool to start a new character as a ghoul or super mutant, even if theyre are only cosmetc or provide a different bonus like being immune to radiation or tougher to kill ect..  
---
Would need to be balanced though
---
Howd you get protectron and wood though
---
Yeah, I'm sure they will; just a bit of hyperbole. 
---
It about half way in
---
What system are you on?
---
MOAR!!
---
I'll join you in a second
---
Ill drop to 750 as that's about all I really need. 
---
That ul do mate :)
---
Seriously guys it's ok to be annoyed about things! Not calling people out in their bullshit just allows them to do it even more. 
---
If Bethesda ever want to pull FO76 of the hailstorm they  made for themselves the only way to do that is be reliable. am I wrong? 
---
ok deal add me I sent msg with my gamertag. i'll be on in 25 mins.
---
Fix for that is not to spawn on contested stations. The spawn protection is already being abused.
---
Endurance has a lot of conveniences and survival perks. Some of them have been mentioned. The thing is, most of them are level locked so you get used to playing without them, and death is a minor inconvenience in adventurer mode... so a lot of PvE players forego them because death has trivial consequences in PvE. That said, they're absolutely required if you're competing in PvP because you need to live longer than the other guy, because surviving actually matters there.
---
Yeah, well, some missions reset all your progress when you join a new session. 
---
Hahaha i love that! "I'm from Britain" as a disclaimer for "i'm used to dissappointment" hahaha i hear that bro!
---
Same here.
---
And robot hookers... clearly.
---
I want to be able to drink my problems away while sitting.
---
I just looked it up a little more. There are 9!!!!!? What the fuck?! How are we suppose to close them all. I mean that is the goal right?
---
Adhesive farm (corn/mutfruit/tato), you'll be drowning w caps in no time. set up CAMP within a reasonable walking distance to a vendor.
---
Hey... Griefer... Leave that CAMP Alone!
---
Actually that world is full, and I'm bringing my spare account as well.

My rig is similar but a different team. I'm running a i7 3770, 8gb of ram and a gtx 970. So power wise we pretty similar, however the game runs great for me. The main difference between your rig and mine is I have the game installed on my SSD which for an open world game is probably making the difference. 
---
Installing to your 7200rpm drive might help a bit, but you should consider getting an SSD 😉
---
The dude was there in the first place you can place your camp here and there are two wood farming stations that you can place wood resource harvesters at.
---
Yeah the game balance would be tricky if the associated character had a stat block different from humies, though from what I understand when you hop in power armor the game considers you the player race power armor.  So it could be similar to that.
---
Either way just the cosmetics of it could be cool.
---
Sounds like lag tbh
---
Ah. I appreciate the sentiment regardless!
---
Its been nerfed several times already. Nothing in this game deserves nerfs. Other areas need buffs instead.
---
The moving issue I've fixed for myself. Build a barebones blueprint or blueprints of your camp without hanging lights and wall decorations. I don't mess with wires or stairs in those either and I haven't had any problems moving since I did that. 
---
I feel I should also note that the nearby ticks help me to farm stmpacks and when player vending comes out I want to use that to give out free stempacks that is if you can sell stuff for free with that.
---
if you take control of a workshop you are putting a flag up announcing yourself to 23+ other people "I am here to PVP"
---
workshops were built as intended capture the flag and hold the flag areas since day one of the game. it even posts a warning you are entering pvp.  
---
you dont wanna get steamrolled by someone pvp geared, or god tier geared compared to your pve build.  
---
do not take a workshop.  
---
dont want to get randomly killed?  
---
dont take a workshop.  
---
dont want to be tracked down to your base and killed and your house leveled?  
---
dont like pvp or having to fight other players?  
---
get mad all ya want scream at the top of your lungs about them griefing you.. it doesnt matter, you, i am sorry to say are wrong. they are not griefing you, they are contesting a workshop as the design of the game intended and as long as you keep coming back and keep taking workshops you are consenting to pvp. and are warned about this everytime you spend caps to start a workshop. 
---
workshops are not in this game to function as a first come first serve fill my stash gas station. they have been, will always be  PVP hub "boxing rings". you cant step into a boxing ring then get mad when someone punches you in the mouth..  
---
ya dont like getting punched in the mouth.  
---
dont take a workshop.
---
I use it, mostly because (a) I’m lazy and don’t want to hit the button and (b) sometimes on the PS4 it has trouble with rapid different buttons and will miss if you’re not looking.
---
Mind you, I only carry a handful of super sticks most of the time, but I do keep it at level 1 on some characters esp Power Armor / melee. Very handy w/ the queen from a QOL perspective and lets you keep swinging.
---
I would not use it at low level - I’d pretty much only use it once you got to the point where you weren’t having trouble getting stimpacks. Low levels auto-stim armor and Born Survivor can bleed you out of stims really fast.
---
I absolutely do not use it on bloody/unyielding. That would be foolish.
---
My IGN is Knight\_Wanderer, add me when you get a chance.
---
Yeah I’m definitely going to get an SSD if I can’t find a way to make this playable, it just sucks because this is the only game I’ve ever had issues like this with :/
---
I like to build multi-storied buildings and have almost always been fucked by staircases.
---
It's just a reality I have to deal with when building /:
---
Ever heard of a setback? They happen and frankly, have happened a lot with this game. It is definitely a no-win situation (when it comes to a lot of players, like yourself.)
---
I'll ask this. Would you have rather them put it out in a state where (a) major bug(s) is/are present but they still hit the release date? Another user mentioned a few possible ones. Let's say the vending machine eats random weapons, meaning you can't sell them. Had they put it out and you tried put up a bloodied Grognak or tse handmade for sale, something someone would definitely buy, and it just disappeared, would you have been satisfied that they hit the release date?
---
Dude I get it but it's not like they are re -inventing the wheel. The mechanics are already in game! I have done a fair  bit of development myself and I know a thing or too about codeing. 
---
they alreqdy have an item that lions to your stash - the fermenter, they clearly have the image as shown on various teasers, the trade mechanics are there, the vendor mechanics are there....honestly I don't see what the problem is.
---
It will be something stupid as they will have restricted it massively or something due to cheap ass servers crashing all the time 
---
It's a tentative plan for this summer. It's so far from anything though.
---
I want to scroll through my pipboy while laying down like a real american
---
I'd like to point out the game became universally deadlier recently and that's a good thing. Enemies seem to die quicker but if careless I started dying myself and I wasn't dying in PvE for months.
---
the map is alot screwy. That Huntington is completely missing is almost a crime, Beckley should be Logan or Chapmanville...it's all kinds of messed up.
---
Thanks.  Makes me feel slightly better.  XBOX.
---
The funny thing is, the biggest demographic for duped items were PVP players who wanted to have the best gear for PVP.  And now the PVP players are upset that their new servers aren't clean of the toxic mess their ilk produced.   
---
What we \_really\_ needed was bethesda to be on the ball with this issue to begin with, and, if I'm honest, a server wipe directly after they fixed the bugs. "here, we fucked up, have a clean slate". 
---
https://xboxclips.com/TANAAS/ce8933ba-78eb-441a-86e2-6ead6d24f718 
---
Is that instantly after I kill them, or after I wait out a bounty?
---
They are meant to be professionals, being able to understand when will or won't content be ready to be released. If you set dates, you should be ready by those dates. Sometimes shit happens, but when the 1st few pieces of new content are constantly being delayed, and usually still with bugs, it says to me that the amount of resources being dedicated isn't enough.
---
I use it all the time, rank 1 or 2 depending on what health % I'm walking around with. Why is it useless?
---
I'm not able to join that game, could you exit to main menu and we can party up and find a world from there?
---
&gt;I absolutely do not use it on bloody/unyielding. That would be foolish.
---
Its actually fine when you have radiation capping your health regen. 
---
They dont
---
Hahahaha.  That's a nice abstract hypothesis you got there, but it does not apply to real life.
---
I've spent two decades writing code professionally.  Shit happens.  Any estimate is a guess that may or may not be wrong.  Don't let it frustrate you.  It is life.
---
I don't mind waiting for something good, I have played FO78 since BETA and loved it despite its many many faults. What I HATE is the unrelaiabilty.
---
Don't set a date for an unfinished product. I have been in  business for 15 years and that's one of the most basic things to know. 
---
As a paying customer who purchased the £150 power armour package I think I have the right to proclame my disgust 
---
Yep I finished it a while ago nothing but a bobblehead and some stims up there
---
Do you like to use PA?
---
I’m running a Mad Bomber (Pistols + lots and lots of explosives) that I turned my old pistol build into when I realized it just sucked. New one is silly fun ... run around gathering up groups of mobs then dropping nuke mines at my feet, cleaning up w/ xE pistols when done.
---
So basically give us a weekend of God roll items. Too nullify all the dupers /s
---
A bounty will be based on the amount of damage they do to either a camp or workshop. The big caps come from killing players outside of bounties.
---
I'll do it now :) 
---
I recently got the study arms plan from a Messenger event in the Forest.
---
I have a Stalkers single action revolver.
---
*5” DMG resistance while aiming, if not in combat, +100% vats accuracy at +50 ap cost, and +33% vats hit chance
---
You absolutely can but it's not outside the realm of reason to be understanding of them putting more work into the game after the rushed, unpolished launch
---
How do you stay in Ammo? I have an executioners faster reload one and it melts enemies but making ammo for it is a huge drag.
---
Any update on this? Have you put anything together to prove a difference? If you're serious about it that would be the best way to get a response from Bethesda.
---
But it's empty.
---
Thanks so much! Quick question though, I see that you added concentrated fire. Is V.A.T.S actually that useful? I’ve heard that it isn’t really need if you can aim but I never really invested in that perk card so I can’t really say much about it. I always went based off what I heard. 
---
Also would you consider any perks that lower weight on specific items and equips useless?
---
And does white knight apply to both regular armor and power armor?
---
Sorry for all these questions lol
---
Shielded Military Fatigues for int/luck/charisma for the drops and scrapping. Failing that, shielded 76.
---
"Get off my lawn" perk: +10% VATS accuracy while rocking in a rocking chair.
---
Its something sexual, dont ask about it
---
Don't worry, gave an upvote. Thanks for clarifying where you got the dog. I really wanted 1, when I get back from holidays it will be my no. 1 priority
---
Who wore it better?
---
Pvp
---
wack
---
Yeah I was pretty disappointed myself 
---
I don't know about that build, rifles and two handed (or one handed melee) dont mix the best. I'd suggest dropping one or the other to do the best you can, but I'm no professional. I do have some weapon suggestions though. Melee - either the Baseball Bat, Grognak's Axe, or Super Sledge. Rifle - either 
---
Hehe, I should called the dog chewie :) 
---
He is from a random spawn.
---
Fast travel to Abby's bunker, head south along the highway... You will see a tree with a vehicle hanging from it and a wendingo usually spawns there... Just past the tree is a burnt out vehicle in the left lane the random spawn is by this vehicle.. If nothing spawns or it's a creature u don't want..  Run back up to Abby's bunker.. Another random event happens on the way back up.. Anyway reload at Abby's bunker and run south to spot again...  Repeat this till you get a pet you want.
---
You need animal friend rank 3 and the random spawn needs to be a creature that is on it's own :)
---
I don't mind that. I have said that about 6 times now. I hate unrelaiabilty. 
---
When something has been made, tested, tested again and they are sure it works...Then set a release date. 
---
I will happily wait months for something if it looks good but it's sloppy to wait 4 days till it's due to come out to pull it back with a wishy washy joke. 
---
Just say what the problems are eight and that they're sorry to disappoint people, the people who are paying for this game. Companies answer to the consumer remember, not the other way around 
---
Should be next patch I think. I can’t wait. 
---
Sweet thanks and good luck :)
---
He’s not done with his Fasnacht mask yet.
---
This happens nearly every time I'm up late. Maybe not *completely* alone all the time, but it's such a big map and so quiet it might as well be. That's the trade-off though, the world will probably be pretty looted and might need to shut down at some point.
---
Also have to consider economics if that's the case. But that's a huge political rant that frankly as a society we wont acknowledge.  Pay gap increases between upper and middle class. It is getting harder to justify buying games these days. It just is.
---
Like Team Fortress 2.
---
Yup. The *Future* of online games is items shops. 
---
Nice I'll have to watch for that one
---
It's a guaranteed Agility Bobblehead, some aid items, and a note written by a guy that's too enthusiastic about gymnastics.
---
You can find said guy dead at the base of the end tower.
---
As a professional coder would you honestly PUBLISH a release date when you wernt sure if your product was working or clearly not finished? I don't mean give an eta as that's not what they did. They published and banged on about it.
---
Would you..as a professional honestly do that? 
---
Same.  First plan I saved up for because it was so fun.
---
👌
---
Yeah. Especially once your past level 50. Everyone is on fair game as far as builds go. 
---
I want a feature where you could post a link to a YouTube playlist and have it act as a hollowtape you plug into the relay towers.  Have them be workshop-esque.  People need to hear more Opeth IMO. 
---
I’m extremely stoked. I’m down for more Appalachian BoS stuff, there totally isn’t enough quests or content surrounding them if you ask me. Super excited to see why they went down there.
---
Add drinking and smokin animations, also totally agree with thhe idea
---
patch is only going to stop slap damage altogether and it will stop camps from taking damage.   
---
workshops have always been and will always be PVP contest zones, he takes a workshop he is flagging himself for PVP. even in our adventure mode they will still be the boxing rings of our game.. 
---
Ah ok, for some reason I thought I was getting nothing
---
Confederate hats
---
If cellphones have taught us anything, it's that human beings can't wait for more that 15 seconds without having an urge to grab and interact with their screens. :)
---
I really think people would interact in the world more if you could do more than just 'sit' or lay down or anything else and do nothing more. Sitting was a way to wait and time travel, now it's hard pointless nothing... :/
---
I hope this gets some consideration.
---
Okay, so, in other words, deal with it?
---
Looks terrible. Do something like [this](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=56375ff&amp;d=s01sg2p02pb2eh2c72ic4a72ak2ad2an2al0a00ao0l71lt2l12lk1lu1lv2cu2&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=5cfa9) instead. 
---
Make your camp in the ash heap for easy access to Blight Soup materials (20% critical damage),
---
Use two weapons: a 10mm or .38 for low VATS costs, and a black powder pistol (BPP).
---
Use the 10mm or .38 for killing low level trash and building critical meter then switch to the black powder pistol for difficult enemies.
---
You will have around 301 damage on a BPP. Stacking a sneak attack, head shot, and critical hit can make that deal over 1,800 damage.
---
I guess.
---
Check the raider vendors. There's a bunch but with some server hopping you'll find it.
---
Yes. Imagine it as a NPC random spawn that comes messes with you. 
---
You know what’s worse than “griefers” at your camp? Two - three scorch beasts spawning and wrecking the whole thing in one shout.  I say scorch beasts are the true griefers. 
---
Thank you for the input, I'll definitely put this into consideration
---
Excellent, thanks then I guess
---
Level 5?  Anything higher?
---
If anyone on PC wants a random friend, feel free to tag along with me. I can't wait to dive into the Burrows. 
---
Going to have to move my CAMP near Harper's Ferry. 
---
You using melee? Melee is absolutely broken right now; swing connectivity has been fucked
---
I wasn't really helping, but, okay.
---
Upvote I feel your pain 
---
Only some can be tamed. Pacify and tamed are different. Look up locations
---
You mean typing right?
---
Nope, ranged. And I know it isn’t lag because when they shoot me, guess the fuck what? I die.
---
Melee just being broken in PvP right now, reverse the “one-shot” nerf 
---
I hope it is considerably harder than silos tbh
---
Clever use of gas mask.
---
Using an auto-weapon? Or slower shot? I think they really screwed over high damage weapons
---
Have an anti armor explosive +1 agility single action on Xb1, what's your offer?
---
The amount of PVP before beta was released was negligible. For all intents and purposes, there was no PVP before survival beta. Which means that PVP itself is still in beta.  That's what you don't realize.    Console users can plainly see this just by looking at the trophy stats.  "Good grief" is the trophy awarded for killing at least 20 other players. It is listed as an 'ultra rare' trophy, meaning only 4.8 percent of players have done it.  It's very clear that little to no PVP has been going on before the release of  survival  beta.  Therefore PVP itself is still in beta.     
---
Yup like wareframe! Didn't they show something like that in the trailer?
---
Fine but you have only 2 examples to validate your slippery slope fallacy. That can be good enough for you but it isn't good enough for me. 
---
Agreed, I solo'ed a Silo in my underwear a few days ago. With a combat knife.
---
You an find the bos armor plans they are just rare drops 
---
Hell no, I never tell people when shit's gonna be ready.  Much to the aggravation of my co-workers.  They want to know when when when when when when when, but I just tell them that making predictions is a good way to hear the universe laugh.
---
Everybody's so focused on WHEN though.  There's a lot of pressure to give people an answer to that question.  I let that pressure roll off of my back unanswered, but I understand why a lot of developers (and marketing people, like in this case) don't.  People assume it's going to be "correct."  They take that as a given.  But getting it right means taking enough time, and it's not always clear how much time it'll take.
---
The pressure to know WHEN something is going to happen is a two-way street, though.   That's why I'm saying to just let it go.  The prediction was wrong.  It will take longer than expected.  What would you have them do?  Release it half-assed?  No, people will complain.  Not give a date?  No, people will complain.  Give an accurate date?  I'm sure they tried.  Wait until it's done and then release it as a surprise?  That'd be my vote, but the people in marketing frown upon it.  I'm sure they have their own perfectly valid reasons for frowning upon it, but they don't really sit well with me.
---
I feel like I'm all over the place in this post because I really have to pee.  (Username checks out.)  But really.  Don't let it frustrate you.  It happens.  I was looking forward to it a lot too, but May will be here before you know it.
---
Cheers :-)
---
There are 2, which one are you lol 
---
Barbarian and other DR perks aren't favoured by the damage calculation, especially once you have good DR from armor. For example, 300 -&gt; 380 DR only reduces damage taken by 9%.
---
Starched Genes is considered essential for using mutations because it's too easy to lose them otherwise. Whether you also add Class Freak depends on your tolerance for the negatives.
---
You need minimum 5 Int unless you have someone else modding weapons for you, but that's probably about all you can afford in a rifle/melee build.
---
I found a suitcase once filled with 50-60 of each drug. 
---
I think drawing your conclusion from the actions of your 8 year old son is a bit silly. He’s 8, he isn’t old enough to seriously consider the morality behind online shops in video games, and most young children I’ve met have been in that “I want everything!” phase even outside of video game shops.
---
I don’t believe there is any generational divide. There are plenty of older people that have no problem with the Atom Shop, and plenty of younger people that do.
---
I would be very interested in that map. I’ve taken pictures of the map every time I find one
---
Couldn't agree more.  
---
Bingo
---
I love those real WV posts
---
What are they adding?
---
What platform I havent had this problem its usually my own internet 
---
Buff Sailor Cat
---
No kidding
---
This is awesome!
---
Don’t worry by the time you know it running silos will be just as easy as any other event. I would have helped if you were on ps4 
---
What level players are you looking for?  
---
You have missed the only option that is actually good  business practice. Tell people about it, tell them is very complicated and then set a date once it has been properly tested. It doesn't need to be released the moment it's finished.
---
If they have tested it and it seems fine then something goes wrong after then they need to test it better. 
---
No matter what anyone says it's very unprofessional to change a date which has been published and they deserve to be called up on it. simple. 
---
I don’t really know what do you suggest
---
What are the rules anything goes? Chems, alcohol, and armor?
---
you clicked to control the workshop.. Did you not read the warning "you are entering pvp"?
---
look, i have three characters, close to 400 total levels, all spent in pve. i dont pvp, i dont go looking for pvp, and i avoid workshops, i dont like being in parties with people that own workshops, i dont like it when someone takes one then logs out defaulting workshop control to me.. 
---
why?
---
because it flags me for pvp, and tells the other 23+ people on the map i am here to fight.
---
you can not take a workshop and not expect someone, doesnt matter if they lvl 50 or lvl 550 to at some point not come to contest your workshop and kill you..  
---
workshops are not a cocoa, cookies, and kumbaya gathering spot, they are bullet to the brain, DCG to the mouth spots.   
---
level in this game does not matter, period. it dont.. all gear and all weapons are capped at 50 currently. all stats are 56 points, someone geared for pvp, with a best in slot item for a lvl 50+, perked properly does just as much damage as a lvl 600 player.   
---
you want to own workshops, fine, get the gear, get the weapons, prepare to defend it from creatures and players, the warning tells you that everytime you take control of one.  
---
youre mad, youre upset, i get it, but you are also in the wrong, you entered pvp, you got killed, that doesnt make them griefers. and coming on here screaming griefers and being unfair is only showing yourself in a bad light since you evidently havent understood the workshop system from day one.
---
I would love to see skins for raider gear/PA.  I have a lvl.15 suit all pimped out with shocks, reactive plates, etc. that I keep handing down to alts.   There was a great raider overhaul mod for FO4 with beautiful retextures.  Would love to see stuff like that as well as skins for non-raider PA that are raider themed.  A rusty x-01 adorned with spikes and rebar and crap would be badass.
---
Shouldn’t have born survivor maxed out but nice
---
What level?
---
Well I don't know what just happened... I had a huge tutorial written and then I looked away from the screen for a moment... when I look back, all my text is gone and I'm logged out :( \*sigh\*
---
So here goes again.... :(
---
Before getting started:  
---
Collect a bunch of "Grape Mentats" since it gives +5 Charisma and better vendor prices *(Charisma is what impacts vendor pricing)*. Having that perk card itself is helpful but at lower levels I wouldn't focus much on it. Free up like 100lbs or more of Stash space, wear stuff with Deep Pocketed mod, and have some cooked food that gives a bonus to carry weight (usually +20), like Radstag and Brahmin based foods.
---
Hitting up the Vendor Bots:  
---
Start at Harper's Ferry (Free States vendor), go to Top of the World's train station (Raider vendor), over to Whitesprings train station (Whitesprings vendor), then over to Watoga train station (Responders vendor) where you can go north after to hit the Brotherhood of Steel vendor. *(Note: I've left out the one other vendor since they aren't high enough level and I didn't want to mention 'who' it was to avoid any spoiler heh).* The reason to start with Harper's is because there is no Stash to easily access, so you'll be selling what's on you first, which at the next stops can pull items from your Stash to sell
---
Focus on:   
---
**+** Automatic Weapons (Assault Rifle, Combat Rifle, Combat Shotgun) with scopes and long barrels, ignoring "Short" variants, but heavily modified non-automatics of each are also good! Also Automatic or Sniper barrel Laser Rifles, ignoring Pistols. A good rule of thumb is only keep weapons with a value of *no less than* 100 caps. Ideally &gt;130, and a lot of those highly modified rifles/shotguns will be above that. *(The exception will be the laser rifles as they oddly have a sub-100 value but somehow still net you roughly the same when sold.)* If you have the perk card to lower the weight on Shotguns, you can then focus on just Combat Shotguns  
---
**+** Grab **any and all chems!** Doesn't matter if they're diluted, or mentats... pick them up! If you have the Pharma Farmer perk card, you can "search" all white and yellow chem containers, and any "Chem Cooler" blue lunchbox (not many are labeled as this). Your bread and butter here will actually be Rad-X (and diluted), Rad-Away (and diluted), and Stimpacks (and diluted). They're all over and aren't too heavy. Naturally, things like Fury, Psycho, Med-X are going to be more valuable, so not as common to find. Again, having the "Pharma Farmer" perk card at even one star, will yield a lot more chems to sell *(sometimes it takes a moment, so expect delayed chimes indicating one was turned up)* :)  
---
**+** Junk that is light, and NOT broken down already. So like any of the Cans, Tin Cans, Aluminum Cans (the raider outpost at Top of the World can have quite a few of the hanging Tin Can traps, if you can disarm, you can get 9 cans each). Granted, these only get you 1 cap each, but due to their weight you can carry a bunch and then if you have 50, that's 50 caps! Also when not fast-traveling between vendors, you can scavenge for things like empty glass bottles: beer, wine, hard liquors. There are quite a few around the second Raider Vendor building at Top of the World (where the can traps are), near the shooting range. Also most train stations seem to have lots of beer bottles in general.  
---
**+** Clothing (not armor) as noted, is also good to pick up. It weighs just .1 lbs, and sometimes even get you more than 1 or 2 caps. The Golf outfits can get you quite a few, but the **Ranger Outfit and Straight Jacket are a LITERAL GOLD MINE!** Seriously, even without Grape Mentats or perks, these yield so many caps. The prison at the north of the Forest is a good location for straight jackets as well as slave collars (which also sell fairly well), as is the Asylum that the BoS held out in to the west of Watoga (has way more than the prison, naturally). Also in the Cranberry Bog is a Ranger outpost, mid region north of Watoga, and has like 5+ Ranger Outfits.   
---
**+** IGNORE HEAVY WEAPONS. They may have &gt;100 value, but their weight ruins it for being able to carry or stash many. Just in my opinion. If you find some within walking distance of a vendor, does't hurt to grab it then.
---
For a good stop to get the weapons... Watoga. You can find a couple assault rifles, a combat shotgun, two or three combat rifles and a bunch of locked containers for even more loot. While one of the combat rifles is on top of the medical building, it's a good thing to run through for chems as well, so bonus! :) If you've already done the Mayor quest, you can venture around there worry-free and not be attacked by the bots. 
---
Once you get out of the mindset of "nothing is worth anything....", particularly if you've played FO3, NV, or 4... you'll then be able to make caps easier since you change your focus to quantity over value. The biggest thing is naturally weight-to-value ratio, and the limited caps available at vendors. Which if you ever deplete them, you can generally buy some plans you may want. Sure, the amount of caps that is restocked is pennies in comparison, but it's something to keep in mind after you've made a ton of caps. :)
---
I'm getting the 2-3 second stutter since the last patch, even though I have a good SSD. It was fine before, so there might be something else going on there. 
---
SSDs definitely shorten the loading screens anyway.
---
Max level, either 45 or 50, I forgot
---
Damage looks normal per shot until they have no health. Then I pump five more shots into them for no effect.
---
Do you mean like how if you ship straws, your paying for air? (Since most of the space in box is empty)
---
I spent twenty minutes on it, it was decently challenging even with marsupial, speed demon, and birdbones.
---
Should I just do one rank?
---
Just remember, maintaining stealth with this build and shooting weak points will increase your damage by a factor of 5. You will be disappointed in damage output if you do not play a stealthy gunslinger.
---
In terms of legendary weapons, look for anti armor on the 10mm or .38, and maybe critical hit damage on the BPP. Two shot is likely better if you can guarantee sneak attack. The difference two shot and +50% crit on a sneak, head shot, critical hit is around 100 damage in favor of two shot. Crit wins if sneak drops. But you can usually just use escape artist perk to get sneak back.
---
Glad to know it’s not entirely my PC but also sad to see that my Xbox runs this better than my computer despite every other game performing above my expectations. I wonder what they did because I’ve heard the same thing from other people as well.
---
Harping on a subject before you need to does not help either. 
---
Force the game to run in borderless full screen. Lots of guides out there, on mobile so i cant link. I went from 30ish fps to 60+.
---
1.5k?
---
and if its junk that just means you have to bulk it
---
You ever find a good location?..... trying to craft some sunshine oil too...
---
At a 5% chance of drop, there is 92.4% chance of success after 50 attempts. 
---
Congrats, your part of the elite 7.5%!, even at 100 attempts  there is 0.5% chance of it not dropping. 
---
 To put another way, for every 200 people doing this, there is probably 1 who thinks we making this shit up about paint. 
---
It’s not level 5
---
I'm wanting a bit more than that, unless maybe you have a trade to throw in as well, any explosive reduced weight guns or explosive laser or plasma weapons are what I'm looking for
---
Meant to say 50%, it’s level 40 and 3*
---
Don’t have any of those.  Name your price
---
you can get 1.4k caps for hitting up all the vendor types 
---
Oh yeah gotcha thanks
---
Not trying to be unreasonable but I want 5k for it. It's a fun gun lol
---
Aye, I should've added an again after my first sentence there - but your statement's better.  No reason to make the best thing in line with the worst.  Better to make the several worse things better.
---
Maybe there are more console users than computer users. If not then I guess the fact that more console users are asking questions to learn things says a lot about computer users that aren't asking questions or trying to learn things.
---
Who isn't excited tbh
---
I’ll rape you if you don’t tell
---
I used to try and farm players for junk, honestly, I stopped bothering.  I've got a list of everything and the best places for it.  Can have hundreds of whatever I want in less than five minutes now.
---
I still like to body folks that are dicks to others in whitesprings, though.  Sometimes, ya get lucky.
---
I get it.  Let’s cal it 4.5k and you got a deal
---
Was talking to a friend about this just the other day.  Would be awesome to have usable arcade cabinets themed for the holotape games.  I also  want a "Commie Whacker" game.
---
This has nothing to do with character builds.  Please stay on topic.
---
I’ve basically gone radio silent across Reddit because of the poor treatment I got on this one, so I really appreciate you saying this 
---
This happens to me alot
---
&gt; It makes no sense to have a mode in a game, that only players with somewhat perfect builds can have fun
---
Or, even worse, RNG dependent builds. 
---
Servers main shut down for individual maintenance 
---
You'll just have to try buddy😘
---
i just want some different sitting positions.  The current pose is quite depressing 
---
Same its disappointing but oh well
---
Agreed, and I have far worse internet than 99% of you *(Cellular, roughly only 2Mbit during the day)*, and my disconnects are infrequent.
---
Nevertheless, having the internet I do, I feel OP's pain. 
---
To that end, OP: are you using WiFi or network cable? If WiFi, that could be the reason. Even something as stupid as someone walking around in another room that's between you and the router could cause a hiccup.  
---
However, in most cases, that shouldn't interrupt you long enough to timeout from the server. That, I would anticipate is a cause of someone else using too much bandwidth (if you live with anyone else). Or if you live in a densely populated area, particularly an apartment building, the shear number of other WiFi routers may just be making far too congested spectrum. :\\ 
---
My only tip would be to restart your router and/or modem before playing 76, at least the router though since that will only take less than a minute to be back up and running.
---
Im intrested. When does this start?
---
You could get another copy of the game and run both from the same PC. It is what I do. Those days you can garb it even for 10$ on sale so it ain't that bad; I paid more for convenience than that (Path of Exile, looking at you).
---
That's understandable. Those are reasons to attack a camp. Myself and friends of mine, some that don't ever engage in PvP, have had their camps leveled for no reason. Like you many people want to have a relaxing game and enjoy themselves, not constantly return to their camp to see it leveled for no reason. Apparently the only way to do that right now is to hide your camp where no one sees it, or benefit from you allowing others to use your camp.
---
How 'bout the 'lurks have plastic nets made of pop/soda six pack rings weighted down with billiard balls that they toss on people (characters, scorched, ghouls, muties) before chowing down. \*grin\*
---
4 hours I will be on earlier probably to prep with my staff you are welcome to come help if you want 
---
I know he isn’t my kid but it seems really irresponsible to me to allow an 8 year old child to play fallout. It’s not exactly the walking dead style graphic but still. 
---
Thanks Saberoid, both those are already on my friend. But great tip, Charleston is great for getting started. 
---
I'm pretty new - like level 6 or 7 - but am up for joining. My PSN is RonaldRaygun289
---
Seriously, what I really want from this dungeon is monster not being healthsack . It will already be a pretty neat thing to explore and use all your teamates perks to deal with the ennemies, but if you want to actually have fun they need to put a lot of ennemy variation or at least give them unique skills like fighting a powerful glowing one in a room full of dead ghouls .
---
Actually it all has to do with questioning things about the game. Try to keep up. 
---
it was somebody leaving there stuff for anybody else 100% sure
---
Gotcha I will be on in 2 hours or so 
---
Great
---
That's fair, I'll hold onto it for you but I probably won't be on today, tomorrow looks much more promising. But it'll be yours :)
---
World of Warcraft has the same stuff not free to play and eso and final fantasy online list goes on 
---
Thanks bud.  What’s your gamer tag?
---
yep. 
---
rip Bethesda with ur lies and undelivered promises. try to milk dat cash cow without players.
---
GT is D1E HARD TOO, hit me up on there and next time I'm on I'll respond and we can meet up
---
Also friends don't let friends build giant cubic boxes. Friend direct them to minecraft.
---
And help them decorate spaces.there's nothing worse than gigantic rooms with all the fornitures in the corners and nothing else.
---
and since when does referencing scum that is second only to mobile gaming legitimize anything?
---
Good luck,  yesterday me and a buddy tried we both had legendary prime weapons had grinded two nukes that we launched beforehand.  We launched the third nuke.We were able to get her down past the first phase and half through the second using every anti scorched item we had to no avail. So best of luck to you I hope you get her down. 
---
You’re just pissed because you’re an explosive 2 year old that spawn kills people
---
Update: We killed her!!!
---
Not really tired of it because it can be done quite fast. If you’re on pc and you can spam space, enter and e all at the same time to go even faster. It would be nice but I’d much prefer all the other crap gets attention first, like spawning in with an unloaded gun or the scorchbeast queen not being so broken with its health pool. The only reason I need to keep crafting 10-20 thousand 5.56 at a time is because of that.
---
Do I need a mic?
---
I try to leave chairs 'pulled' out and tables n other things cluttered.
---
I watch hermitcraft on YT and I've learned a lot about decorating a space and details especially from goodtimeswithscar, that mans attention to detail is amazing.
---
I will rape you, kill you, then rape you again 
---
Sanguine Rose syringer
---
“Eyed” Piper. 
---
I want Enclave signage. 
---
I have spectrum which is the worst service provider lol 
---
Need one for less recoil. I’d prefer more for the .50 though, I have an explosive one I’d like to use regularly again.
---
Un-possible I've just got the one life😏
---
I’ll give it a go! I don’t necessarily have low FPS but my game freezes very often for about 2 seconds to 30 seconds but who knows? 
---
It's a verified joke and not a bug?
---
If you only want to use better inventory, in your Fallout76Custom.ini just use this:
---
\[Archive\]
---
sResourceArchiveMisc = SeventySix - MiscClient.ba2, BetterInventory.ba2
---
If you wasn't using the custom ini make sure you copy the archive section from your fallout76.ini in the main game folder to your Fallout.ini to get the current defaults back.
---
Welcome form my part
---
my first (beta) was a shotgun build, after tse nerf respec'd to vats rifle shes 236, 2nd build was unarmed/1handed melee shes 120ish, 3rd is going to be a vats pistol build shes 19.  
---
pistols are so cheap or are tossed right now they are easy to get so figured id collect what i could for her get her past 50, and if they ever get boosted to be even more viable ill already have her going and carrying an arsenal now, while everyones throwing pistols away.
---
Unfortunately the engine is just not very optimised and dated. People with high end machines still get big frame spikes and freezes. All we can do is hope that optimisations come in the future 
---
I think ultracite should for sure have them since it’s the brotherhood’s advanced armor
---
Cool, level isn’t a problem. I’ll message you our discord and maybe later I can help you level up.
---
No mic is needed but obviously they are encouraged to help with communication! I will communicate with you via Reddit messages if that works for you?
---
From what I understand AA doesn't apply to energy damage right now, as it halfs ballistic resistance only.  They might fix it at some point bit for now 2 shot is your best choice.
---
That sounds dope
---
As a European on reddit, I know the feeling.   
---
Everything has to be black and white these days, either something is "awesome" or it "sucks dick". What happened to nuance and patience? If something is bad people act like the sky is falling down. Speculation has literally no benefit to you, all it does is give you false expectations and riles other people up about it. We can note that this is a bad development without filling the front page with caps lock titles aimed directly at bethesda.
---
I really hope something changes, it really sucks that I've spent 75% of my time so far changing graphics settings and messing with the games config files rather than getting to play.
---
New England. North and east a bit. Not too far from Boston 
---
Can you make the bright headlamp for Excavator and/or Ultracite? The plans don’t seem to exist for headlamps but at the same time I can make headlamps for either T51 or T60 and I have no idea how. 
---
And no amount of hopping to all the places that sell excavator mods/plans has helped me find it. 
---
Id like the option to paint your own armor. I know this gives people the opportunity to ruin it with dick drawings etc but I’d love to paint my x-01 with matte red and black.
---
I reiterate my previous statement 
---
Okay..... But what were you wearing in-game?
---
I’m not sure. I can check tomorrow when I’m online again. They may just be available via mods. 
---
People are bad in real life too. Can we stop pretending people don't do these things? Want to know why they do it? This post. Your reaction. It's just the truth.
---
Yeah. But the thing is that you don’t find those laying around at brotherhood outposts. I think possibly that ultracite might only get a sentinel paint.
---
Ah. I’ve not been that direction yet. I know Toronto is about 7 hours away from here
---
Yeah it’s weird. I play a lot of games and it’s very rare I have to go below medium settings. On fallout I run potato mode and still get freezes and stuttering 
---
Yeah. I like my friends to have self respect 
---
I just want to be able to close the door on the porta potty while I'm in there sitting down.
---
Agreed!
---
The new AS paint for Ultracite has BOS logos all over, actually.
---
&gt; What is your argument exactly? 
---
That everybody dies in survival regardless of armor type. 
---
Sadly orbital strikes are also weak with the same build. 
---
I know, exactly. All the more reason you should be able to put the other BOS paints on it. 
---
Fear and ignorance. Bethesda doesn’t know how the online thing is going to work, so they stretched the grind out far, far too long, and they are afraid to do anything that might reduce it. 
---
I’m sure their view is you should just grind everything for each character from scratch. 
---
Most helpful reply I’ve ever gotten on reddit lol. Thank you so much!
---
You could purchase the game on a new account and trade that way. I know you shouldn’t have to, but it’s the only real way you can do it without a friend right now. Thankfully the game is much cheaper than at launch.
---
AS? What does that mean?...
---
Yeah in terms of purchasing them I think they’re just available via mods but ... I *somehow* learned them for one PA. And I have no idea how. I super wish I knew. 
---
Atomic Shoo
---
I mean the other night I accidentally shot someone's crops while I was trying to stop the mole rats from destroying them. I felt really bad
---
 :( sometimes it's not intentional
---
Dude same. My favorite building piece in Fallout 4 was the bus/trailer. It looks really crappy in a good fallout way, also it would probably be what alot of stuff would be built with if this was a real world situation.
---
Any thoughts as to why?
---
Oh the yellow one? I met someone who had it. I didn’t really see any logos but if that’s true. That’s bad if we ever want the T-45 and T-51 paints to be earned in-game.
---
What type of armor has it? I have a heavy combat and cannot mod it to pneumatic.and yeah i guess i have dismantled enough to kbow them all. Is it one of those that can only be bought?
---
Or at least make it so the pacifist is full effect meaning if you're not attacking the other player, then they should do absolutely no damage to you at all, not very minimal damage while you stand there and get shot over and over until you die... lol glad they made the separation of the 2, but they should take pvp out of adventure mode because then it's not adventure mode anymore. 
---
A lot of people are saying that it wasn't this bad before the most recent patch but I have no clue myself since I'm new to the PC version but yeah, I'm very used to installing ENBs and 2K texture packs for Bethesda games but we can't even use the base graphics settings for this game sadly.
---
Do U have another character? U can double what u get in a day..go to Camden park..defeat everything there and sell all their weapons to the vendor there..do the same thing at harpers ferry
---
Just because it’s available via a plan for some PA’s doesn’t mean they are available for all PA’s. I know X-01 for example is all mods. No plans. 
---
You are a toxic noob that just insulted a player that dislikes spawnkilling and spreads the culture of not doing that, and you lack imagination to understand consequences of your ignorant ideas. And consequences are exactly such: it would be abused of gain positional advantage and define the moment of convenient attack.
---
You are further reinforcing my thesis that PvE people should not be allowed to discuss survival. You are a prey.
---
Kill super mutants, they only drop a few caps each but it’s a great way to farm without the vendor
---
Brilliant and much needed.
---
As a West Virginia native, born and raised, it makes me happy not only to be able to visit these locations I've seen countless times in person transformed into a digital media that I can enjoy, but also seeing others come to my home and see the natural beauty that this state has to offer.
---
Truth.
---
im not much younger than you but there has always been an overlapping cost on top of buying a product in the mmo world.  free to play MMOs created the cash shop to stay competitive  without being able to retain subs, like other MMOS could easily and still do, like WoW.
---
People digging in landfills have pulled out 40 year old hot dogs that still looked like hot dogs, so...
---
While there have been some major bugs and crashes squashed, general fps performance had been bad since launch. Hell it was bad in fallout 4. I get a steady 60 FPS in potato mode in areas that don’t have heavy traffic but I get 3-4 second freezes all the time regardless of where I am on the map. Seems worse at Whitesprings 
---
So people are jerks just to be jerks. That's understandable. I didn't know if there were achievements, atom challenges etc or some other reward. Apparently there isn't.
---
I was trading a buddy of min grape mentats and set the price to 0 and when he took them they left my inventory and didn't end up in his, just vanished 
---
PC usually encounters they most bugs
---
I just want different versions of the Bloatfly Syringer, let me spawn Bloodbugs, Honeybeasts and Radscorpions out of my enemies.
---
Ping issue? Or they could be wearing multie peices of life saving armor. Dont know why more people dont use it. I have popped back up and killed many a player as they strolled over hoping for my loot.
---
There are those who work and know the value of money. Those, who are held to standards and must meet deadlines. Why should they expect any less from anyone else? It's this mindset and the lack thereof that creates the divide.
---
I want a Mechanist outfit in the game.
---
Or keep it at Whitesprings and yell about gentrification
---
Didn’t I get kicked from that?
---
that makes sense
---
im running 144 fps all the time, but i get like 0.5 sec stutter every 6 sec. 
---
I tried windowed mode, and all settings to low and high.. same FPS but the stutter persists. 
---
i have 60mbit download. :(
---
People don’t use this? If your in power armor you have to have this, and if your outside power armor you would waste an armor slot on this? 
---
inb4 they only make the long scope available for it
---
That different than completely destroying every aspect of someone's camp.
---
Just buy a single use drone from atom shop, this is what all players want... No wait i make a mistake i want fridge screw the drone 😈
---
Thank you I'm not the only one here this happens to. Incredibly frustrating
---
&gt; How do you stay in Ammo?
---
yes
---
That's really weird, my CPU and mem are averaging around 50-70% usage and my GPU is seeing 30% usage so its nothing too bad there but like you said, the 3-4 second freezes are horrible. I'd imagine whitesprings is awful but I can't imagine trying to go through a nuke zone.
---
Better yet.....
---
Give me a plastic 6 pack holder for my beers that I can use as a trap for Mirelurks.
---
What a nice guy!
---
What'd you fill it up with?  Chems?
---
Very meta. I approve.
---
Yes it called friend list
---
He better be on later, I get off work in 4 1/2 hrs
---
Where can you easily farm hundreds of cloth?
---
Super Duper maxed and Ammosmith maxed are essentials (at least to switch to for crafting) on any heavy gunner build.
---
Yeah I feel that, I get around 60-70 on average and then it freezes for an abnormally long time. I really hope they address the issues in a patch soon. I feel like its an issue with how they utilize entity loading and activity across the map.
---
Dunno lol I have just the basic mobile app and it’s blue!
---
Game lacks content, but we are expected to make our own fun of it. It can be fun playing as a dickhead raider
---
Still selling? Wanting to get 2 as I had to clean out my character.
---
Best 2 out of 3 matches advances you to the next round.
---
No weapons besides unarmed weapons in semi finals and finals (boxing gloves, powerfist or knuckles) 
---
Legendary armor is ok. 
---
One stimpack allowed per round. 
---
No other aid. 
---
No bobbleheads or magazines. 
---
The use of VATS is ok but not encouraged. 
---
Anybody who is not fighting must remain seated at ringside. 
---
It’s the whole broad as an ocean deep as a puddle argument for me.
---
It was patched a few arches ago
---
If you were really against spawn killing you would agree with me on the parley idea because it’s a good idea. Have you seen how well it works on Red Dead Redemption 2. And you’re thesis is bs. I would like survival mode if they made it good. Changes to it such as my parley idea would make it good and make me want to play it.
---
if you and a friend both over 60 cant run a silo after trying for 3 hours, something is wrong with your builds or playstyles, or this is a late april fools and youre doing the runs in lvl 5 leather with a pipe pistol?  
---
silos can be solo'd by a single lvl 40 of most any decently geared character.. possibly lower if it was a melee with an instigating powerfist at lvl 35, and decent sneak rate.. and im not talking glitching it or anything cheating wise.  
---
ive known several people running silos in under 14 minutes at lvl 60 solo and in teams. 
---
care to share your builds? perks? stats? armor? and weapons?  
---
maybe something glaring we could point out to help you?
---
have a friend i met when he was like 61 or 62, loved doing silos, would always run em solo, took him roughly 12 minutes to complete one, he just hated hunting keycards so i always kept a stock of keycards, hed make a comment "man i wanna launch a nuke" i hand him a card (drop) and i could almost feel him skipping away to a silo with a grin.
---
Why bother playing the game at all, you have to REALLY reach to say that you have been playing the game for a decent amount of time and not been stuck in the dull gameplay loop this game has.
---
It happens with many of the events that have a legendary boss, including the Fasnacht parade and Heart of the Swamp. It only makes sense to reward the legendaries automatically instead of requiring looting that is always buggy when 23 other players are there.
---
Pulls out a fat man :)
---
How long does it last? I won't be able to get on for another 5 hours.
---
Sent you a friend request. Hope to find you next time you are on!
---
Dang, well thanks for the fast response 
---
I play because I enjoy the game. I have yet to get bored enough to want to destroy something someone else worked to build. If you are that bored with the game that you want to destroy things others have built, why not play something else? Or better yet, why not actually engage in PvP where there is a challenge?
---
Even having a friend to trade with gets tiresome. Like you, I have a Melee and Stealth Sniper build and often have to transfer weapons, armors, mods, etc around as well as manage my stash on both characters. Usually my friend and I will have to allot some time for this transfer session every other day. It's also not 100% safe as I've had items disappear after trading and getting a server disconnect shortly after. 
---
It will still be happening then I have no idea how long as long as people are there last time we were there for about 2 hours and then someone decided we should go after the SBQ queen so we went and killed it
---
That’s so cool, I’ve googled West Virginia a lot from playing this game and would love to see the real thing! 
---
Why destroy a building that is just sitting there? Why not actually engage in PvP then and have a challenge?
---
Oh, interesting and helpful, thank you. I stand corrected then about the order of drops. I haven't tracked my drops, but I must have handed in around 100 TD and have only received the Initiate paint plan until now.  [Your picture](https://imgur.com/a/sT35DY6) shows duplicates, how did those drop? Are you just as likely to get a known plan or the next one in order?
---
I cant see how they can make this super hard or anything without drastic rebalancing. It’ll either be tough for regular builds and a breeze for optimized ones or impossible for regular builds and hard for optimized ones. Melee does absolutely ridiculous damage as do bloodied range builds. If its balanced around that most people wont be able to complete it at all.
---
I will rape your dog while using your cat as a fucking condom
---
Yes, thanks 
---
I dont have any plans for raider armor. Except mods of course. I believe they arent in the game or am I just unlucky?
---
do u nuke her again?
---
Within 5 minutes of reading this I've found 3 technical data. What an awesome guide, keep up the good work.
---
i am the above friend and can confirm lmao
---
Curious what you mean by eliminate. Curious why you even bought this game expecting full protection from other players at all times. If there were no threat of getting smoked I would have left a long time ago.
---
No, all that does is regen her, even if she already regenerated
---
Is it me or are people with the raider tags usually toxic?
---
Hey b0ss, if you're still selling I'd like to buy twisted muscles and talons. Psn is Thepunishedone
---
Some dire wolf action 🤘
---
thanks man!
---
Explains a lot if they’re raiders
---
I meant, if u nuke fissure prime again now
---
What time zone
---
Wall decorations perhaps. I dnt have em so dnt know off my head lol
---
Yeah youre right. Maybe that was badly comunicated but I meant some recolors and stuff. A Completely different skin would still be nice though.
---
I don't have any pets my dude. But nice try?
---
You have issues, my man, you might want to see someone about them.
---
It's in the post Central standard Time
---
Completely agree couldn't have said it any better myself 
---
Thank you. I will be seeing you tonight.
---
Great 
---
Inbox me your PSN
---
Yea think about it what do players hate more than losing a potential god roll weapon.
---
I water boarded my last therapist because she wouldn’t tell me how she already knew my name on the first day
---
PVP exists and theres the workshops, so mechanically it's an advantage, even if you don't participate. Especially if you hate repairing stuff. If you choose a less resource cost armor because of repairing or it's not always at 100% then the whales have an advantage. If you use repair perks, the whales that don't have an advantage.
---
I’d use furious if I were you
---
Thanks?🙃
---
I contacted Bethesda support and they had me try a few different things. The thing that actually worked was deleting the game from my ps4 and reinstalling. 
---
Not a clue! There’s a bunch of brotherhood discord servers mate! Did you have a name in there? 
---
All armor types have Pneumatic as an option in the torso.
---
It is learned by scrapping, there are not plans for it, or at least there weren't when I created the spreadsheets I use to track my 'unlocks'.
---
I think I joined the one that had a video on YouTube about it, I probably got kicked from being idle though so my bad
---
Y'all need to figure out a way to have gun duels. I walk around with -1 strength.
---
I’ll be on again tomorrow. I’ll accept your friend request and when you see me on, feel free to stop by. 
---
The knee you took an arrow to? 
---
Havent had it happen with SBQ myself, but definitely a good idea to avoid this. And it should be implemented.
---
You can buy it, but you. can't make it until you get the large purifier water plans. 
---
Sweet
---
I used to be in that one I think but it’s long gone, we are a different one than that lol care to join up?
---
Your down votes are harsh but I understand your opinion 
---
I just want to make sure I'm not a dick while trading, it's easy to screw people over due to the nature of the trading system. I'm a trader so I want to have a good reputation yknow?
---
I give you a 10 for originality.
---
Sure why not
---
I disagree. Your kid just *wants* in general. He’s little. It’s what they do.
---
What I don't get with quest is what does it accomplish? BoS sacrificed a couple soldiers, trekked across the West Virginia and risked comprising their relations with the Responders and for what? You load up the sample and that's it. I don't get what it's supposed to do, but to be fair I can't remember all the notes relating to it apart from what I mentioned above and how a glowing one killed one of the BoS. 
---
Yeah right below the ammo/loot etc small signs
---
Lol, I don't believe your statistics. Mine are 95% chance to drop aid, 5% apparel. 
---
Seriously, I have over 500 hours in this game. I've picked up on this quest early. I have turned in TD at least 300 times  and not once have I gotten paint or any other 'rare/rare-ish' item. I know my luck (irl) isn't great, but FML, this is terrible.
---
But thank you for keeping my hopes up.
---
Oh yeah unless it's a turret farm, that's just because they have a very small dong and need to feel better about it
---
The only thing to do is have a friend hold your stash. Seems like the 1970s...
---
Thank you for being the decent person in the chat. Fallout 3 and New Vegas just had better story and weapons along with unique armor compared to the newer ones.
---
I am on an alt, unfortunately the heal is pretty low so it's meh. :| These and Vampire weapons need a buff.
---
I run with medium settings on an MSI GE73 with a GTX1070. Any time I get into an SBQ battle on ultra settings I crash. The game needs serious resources to look good.
---
30-50!
---
Theyre not lights its under wall decor
---
Railway spike
---
Good find mate, I managed to get the BOS leg combat armour plans before the patch
---
Do you know which event specifically? :) 
---
I've given up on trying to make it look good at this point, but yeah I don't doubt that. At best for me, its playable at medium with shadow distance set to the lowest and all of the fades to the lowest as well. That's crazy though because the 1070 is a seriously good card.
---
Thanks, I wanted to try to help explain why a store is not a bad thing, but it should only have cosmetic items in stock. 
---
You should buy some repair kits and power armor paint skins from the atom shop. They gotta pay those code monkeys somehow.
---
If this is in survival I’m in, I play a bounty hunter. Gotta say it’s pretty terrifying going alone.
---
They sound like those r/BeggingChoosers people now that you list it out. 
---
I mean, as much as the floating houses are dorky (and easily contextualized with posts), it's entirely Bethesda's fault that players build like this.  If their bizarre foundation placement logic didn't suck so much, players would have no reason to.  The irony is, that logic probably exists to force players to build plausible structures, but it does the complete opposite.
---
That's stupid. Look at how many people are walking around with full sets of 3 star armor and weapons, and loaded with caps so they can buy whatever new stuff they need. 
---
Are the desks in Whitesprings Bunker instanced? I've run across people farming the desks when I get up there, but I come along behind them and find TD. I'm guessing yes?
---
I think there's supposed to be a network to Maxon out west. Not sure how.putting data in a safe transfers that. I assume... because Fallout.
---
Where will the app be available 
---
I won't be on until after the ball games tonight. Message me your PS name if you don't come up with something in the next few hours. 
---
With all the bad pr Youtubers and twitch streamers already gave this damn game was it such a genius idea to pull this stunt though
---
Fallout 76 always feels like one nail from the grave and it was slowly working its way back through patch fixes and the well journalised events and upcomming content to bam articles about pay to win its like they are trying to make it fail now 
---
The new nukachug animationshow your love of nukashine by downing a whole jug of nukashine and collapsing where you stand at a steal of only 2000 atoms for this one day sale item
---
Personally I feel like 'Vault-Tec' and 'Nuka Cola' are both used to death. Let's start changing things up a bit.
---
Right, I’m what I meant was that I’ve searched for plans for every one of them to test the availability and couldn’t find them. It seems like they’re a unique thing that aren’t really considered mods in the same sense. 
---
You can (very rarely) learn how to make mods by scrapping PA parts though, so maybe I scrapped a helmet and got it that way. 
---
So it's still possible, thanks man. 
---
Yes please! I don't see how this would hurt anything. Mules are going to mule. May as well make it convenient.
---
9. Seriously, disconnects.  I'm sick of them, Bethesda.  It's been six months and server stability still comes and goes with each patch.  If you expect us to run your new raid dungeons, or do anything that takes more than a half-hour to complete, you really need to get this sorted.
---
Thank you for the info. 
---
Owww so Anti armor does not work on energy weapons? That changes alot. Many thanks guys!
---
Why stop at SBQ? All events (dailies, timed, static, etc...) should reward the completion automatically. Hordes, Wolfpack, etc..., can be made to trigger the drop on completion rather than hoping the server lets you loot the corpse.
---
Lucky. When I exit the game my game freezes up and I have to ctrl+ alt+ delete and log out to force close. 
---
What is funny is if I minimize game and right click and click close game, then it works fine. 
---
They need to fix this. Very time consuming on the players end 
---
Pretty much all combat is dumb
---
Oh I get that but there is a few tricks to make those floating structures look a little better.
---
Perhaps power pylons with Wires attached to the build to 'tether' the structure to the ground or posts stacked up to the building for more structure.
---
I don't think it *has* to be done but it would make some of these houses look a little better especially to floating platforms that have no walls or anything.
---
Mostly I'm just taking the piss out of the floating structures I've seen.
---
The ps4 branch of the guardians is very new, and we don’t have that many members at the moment. However, this doesn’t mean we won’t do survival in the future. Personally I don’t have the skill nor caps  to play it, but a couple other members may be interested. We are mostly protective and defensive. If your still interested, I can message you the discord.
---
Thy are not lights
---
Craft. Seriously. Start crafting and you’ll be SURPRISED how quickly you make room.
---
I was at 795/800 last night. Crafted me a LV45 Excavator to sell, and I’m magically st 625-ish.
---
I'll try to login when I get home in about 2 and a half hours. Just on a break at work right now. Otherwise I'll be ingame off and on over the next 2 days
---
SBQ isnt the best way to farm legendaries tbh, its the one way to get prime plans though.  Keep that in mind. Im not sure if they would consider altering the drop value in some way but tbh, i doubt it. 
---
You should check how much it costs to craft flamer fuel then reconsider...
---
Such a shame the game ended up like it did.
---
I've tried it on about five times since the beta and I still can't do it.
---
Hmm, I was thinking of Nukashineing an enemy, like a deathclaw. It blacks out and shows up in Morgantown airport, terrorizing all the low levels. 
---
Stop talking shit out of your ass please.
---
I've seen this in Clarksburg too, I think there might be a stampede of them there or something!
---
I thought it would be fun to have NPCs in the game that would be hard to tell from real humans, similar to "West World." I suppose that they couldn't speak, similar to a player without a microphone.
---
Refresh Walmart Canada?...
---
You call those battered clipboards?
---
I have no clue how to use discord, if they’re short on caps go bounty hunting. You can make 800 caps an hour if you get lucky. just cycle who gets the killing shot in the group, or have a gliched the dragon that loads your entire stash of .50cal balls at once and let’s you fire them as fast as you can pull the trigger. Best glitch ever.
---
You bought your son at a game stop?
---
Because of server lag, Too bad you can't craft before getting into a server.   Like PUBG or similar.  Have a waiting room  server but have this one that has crafting tables and stash boxes available.  You choose when you want to load to a server. Forced passive mode to protect .  That would be the whole server.  Just a big room or maybe something like white springs. People could also use that server to to trade so they don't have to load to a real larger server.  Might be too much to code... I don't know. 
---
You said it yourself with the metal poles.
---
The problem is that the game can be very fickle about the placement of those.  They can only be placed around the perimeter of the structure and they prevent you from putting up railings on open edges too.  And you can plop them into the ground, but only to a certain extent before the game throws a fuss.
---
Power pylons don't seem like a bad idea.  In general, I really would like to have some generic, vertical poles that aren't intended for stairs.
---
Idk but hopefully it's on apple and Android. It would be a plus if it's on PC so you can do the same on an app.
---
It would be up to Bethesda on the idea.
---
Man all you whiners about repair kits need to get fucked.
---
This pretty much is a cosmetic item with how easy repairing stuff is.
---
If this were an actual weapon or piece of armor going on the shop, then I would be pissed.
---
Ok. I'm on moble ATM so can't view your setup. But since my build  that I run is basically what you asked for I'll link what I have and some alternative  cards other than crafting ones. Note this build requires you to swap card when building/repairing items/camp

Works ok with Melee And ranged. Al rise and I use an 1*instigating suppressed Gauss for my sniper rifle. A furious 1* .45 combat rifle and 1* furious 59 Cal and 1* Executioners Gatling gun. Course I farm about 4 hours for ammo every few days between queen fights
---
Yeah, it actually is a Daily now (if not less frequent).
---
Its bacially Trion level management of a mmo which doesnt end well for alot of people
---
Sure you can. They're a bunch of juvenile idiots who are compensating for something that's missing in their real lives. People like this are why we have a PvP server. They need to be isolated from the rest of us because they are incapable of interacting constructively with other. 
---
More combat armor skins
---
A lot more weapons skins
---
Epic photos!  And Bethesda did a damn fine job of recreating the detail, so much so that when I looked at the Harper's Ferry pic, I could point out where the locked gate near the spawn point and the free states vendor's alley are.
---
Cool, thanks for the suggestion, sadly our communications are based in discord but it’s very easy to use, so potentially reconsider 
---
Sign me up biys
---
I have an explosive. You're more than welcome to buy it
---
3* Stalkers Explosive. Level 50. 
---
I'll be on tonight. Around 8p EST
---
I’ll keep you in mind, we just bought a house and are working on our budget. Soon as I know I can afford internet I’d be able to help, currently gaming using a mobile hotspot. It works, until it doesn’t... drop a 3* legendary go look see a combat.... lost connection... NOOOOOO......
---
I'm glad you're satisfied, pay\_2cum.
---
It will tie in from your existing stash.
---
You were briefed? Huggies or pampers?
---
Yea, fallout 76 in general has that problem, all the lost connections I suffered through XD
---
I think its a vending machine and itll probably be tied to your stash, like how the fermenter is. 
---
I found a bunch of springs and gears in a train station suitcase last night. It was the best.
---
Torment was about as good as it has ever gotten for me. 
---
I was under the impression that the Albino variants weren't tamable? Any evidence to the contrary?
---
Yeah, I would love some more 'detail' pieces and also wooden posts instead of the metal ones that aren't "stairs" ^also ^vertical ^half ^walls ^but ^that's ^neither ^here ^nor ^there.
---
I try to place a few posts and if I still have platforms 'floating' too far from the posts and I throw down some power conduits or pylons and wire them up like support wires.
---
It only makes the build look marginally better, but I'll take that small margin.
---
I will have my area Mic on so I can officiate and communicate but everyone else's needs to be off after check-in. 
---
It’s not so much about farming the legendaries, it’s just the fun of everyone gathering together to take her down and all the effort and resources being for a maybe adequate weapon or armor piece. 
---
Sell drugs. You kill stuff that drops chems you dont really need often or at all. Sell them. I sell anything other than the base chems and things I need to create other stuff. Killing ghouls usually renders caps with the right perk, sell the lower level armor you dont use. It all adds up. Once ya get so far ahead it becomes easy to save and still buy what you need. 
---
They have photos on the Greenbrier Resort website at [http://www.greenbrier.com/HomePage-Sub-Pages/About-The-Greenbrier/Media-Gallery](http://www.greenbrier.com/HomePage-Sub-Pages/About-The-Greenbrier/Media-Gallery)  
---
From what I've seen digging through photos on the web, they nailed it.  Absolutely nailed it.  At least for Whitespring.
---
I don't see why this isn't getting more appreciation, something like that where it would include people accessing your stash and buying items without your immediate confirmation has so many ways to go wrong. I couldn't be happier that they admit it's not in an ideal state and want to push it back further to fix it up and improve it. 
---
i have a hard time not falling off stairs in let alone these damned obstacle courses.. i tried it 2 or 3 times then got fed up with it and used my jetpack to get on the tower.. 
---
Thankfully they fixed a lot of the dupers, my PC account had the most glitches and issues but that’s how I got the dragon reloaded it once and 28 shots on demand. It still has an impenetrable PVP base. Good stuff.
---
I'm from the NES gen. In theory, the microtransaction model should allow the rich to subsidize the poor, but it only works with good intentions from the dev/publisher. Given how capitalism works - a mandatory growth every year - I think it's a formula for a desaster for gaming in a long run.
---
It's even worse when an unfinished game is released deliberately just to monetize it.
---
While I try to be understanding and tolerate some of it, I dislike the cost of playing a game becoming arbitrary. It's a grey area for me.
---
If the inflation needs to be covered, I'm willing to accept a "pay $15 now to get all future shop items" addon. That way the total cost isn't arbitrary.
---
If it's a trade off, I accept monetized cosmetics. At least it's not a must buy, so the expense doesn't become arbitrary. It also doubles as a nice way to "pay what you like" to support a game which ends up winning my heart.
---
Oh, the subscription model. What's interesting about it was that you could avoid those games and play something else. If we stay on the current path, I think microtransactions will be in every game and will become unavoidable.
---
So that's a mixed response from me. I don't mind microtransactions in theory. But I'm afraid about the fact that there is no ceiling on how much you end up paying to get a "full game", and there are many other pitfalls which only a good will from the industry is the solution, once this is in full swing.
---
Do you trust them all to such an extent? I don't, not because I think they are bad, but because I know the tendencies of capitalism. Some responders here are sleep walking into it by the looks of it.
---
I have a vampire Gatling laser with 40% bashing damage
---
Parents didn't show them enough love 
---
It needed a real beta, let us hammer it for 3-4 months while the code is being fixed twice a week 
---
You're most welcome :) 
---
It's a struggle to make caps in 76, which was not helped much by Bethesda pushing back the Player Vendors update till next month, instead of in a few days :\ 
---
The plans are expensive from the vendors, too; however, just frequenting the locked containers in Watoga, Harper's Ferry, and... the BoS Fort/Camp in between that I can never remember the name of... I generally end up finding the plans I'm after :D Generally weapons, but those are important too!
---
Pistol single shot and fully automatic! That’s what I’m doing and it’s great in pvp. Get one that uses less action points in vats and speed demon, it’s fun
---
yup still happens from time to time.. think monday i ended up on one. was with 3 others in a team and we were getting ready to do something so i checked map to see if anyone was near what we were gonna be doing and found unless someone was sneaked we were only 4 left on server, so we nuked whitesprings instead.
---
Level 45 or level 50?
---
Thats good to know, I'm trying to recreate it so I can figure out the trigger lol
---
Can I ask how you keep yours so low?
---
I think I saw that pop once because he ragdolled for a second. Could be wrong
---
You do know its still beta right?
---
My biggest complaint is the caps. Just dumb. Combined with 70% of aid dropped seems a bit much. 
---
&gt;!If you've gone to West Tek and read about the origin of the Snallygasters... You kinda sorta have one of the first friendly NPCs? I'm guessing the Nascent Snallygaster isn't a first generation like the one that broke out. Considering the breakout was supposed to be sterile, yet there's Snallygasters all over and this one is labeled as "Nascent" (new), you probably have one of the first reproductively capable horrible human genetic mistakes!!&lt;
---
&gt;!  !&lt;

&gt;!Treat your semi-human affront to creation well! You're its only connection to its roots that treats it with the sympathy it deserves!!&lt;

---
You're not talking about "in game" any more, are you .....
---
I have a maxed stash and about 600 lbs of junk over my carry limit. Learn me how to not hoard. 
---
There's always one near my camp in the bog! Annoying at first haha
---
For real. Super Mutants might only have one to a handful of caps each but they add up fast. Especially if you're farming super mutants at a place where there's a ton of them, like West Tek.
---
Misc junk, armour and weapons for me, I’ve been hanging onto useless legendaries,  things with stats like added damage against animals, for when the vendor gets released and the rest is crafting materials. Currently have at least 400 each of screws, adhesive and springs plus a healthy amount of ballistic fibre and other crafting/repairing essentials. Add in my excavator and T-60 power armour and that about covers it!
---
It wasn’t meant to have any trade between characters .
---
I don’t even understand why I would need more than 1 honestly.
---
Yeah I don't get it. Seems like there's this great divide where people either love NV or they just hate everything about it and everyone who enjoyed it. Very volatile topic it seems. I've enjoyed them all so far. Love me that Elite Riot Gear! The pieces should be a set in 76. Then can upgrade them -riot gear-advanced riot gear- elite riot. 
---
Well, for me, it's because I have a bizarre insistence on keeping the unique weapons around.  Useless stuff like the Bunker Buster, Stand Fast, etc.  Another pointless use of 60-70 pounds was collecting all the different Power Armors.
---
I keep Bobbleheads and Magazines around in hopes that I can eventually display them on a rock.
---
I keep a ludicrous number of Known Plans with the intent of selling them for dirt cheap when player vending happens.
---
I generally hold onto anything that has 3 stars, regardless of whether or not I'll actually use it, for the Legendary vendor.
---
Lol you could of avoided it entirely by using a better method.
---
Play FoNV dead money and try not to get over encumbered. 
---
Good Info.
---
Do you not also get the BOS Shielded Underarmor plans from turning in Technical Data?
---
I'm worried they're going to make caps harder to get once a vendor from each faction is in Whitespring. Seems too easy to hit up all the vendors without travelling anywhere.
---
Hrnngn I feeling really crabby right now
---
I see them in about 25% of sbq fights
---
Normally not a problem, but now my stash is full of 3*legendaries for the legendary vendor. 
---
what do you mean tiny? the room is 2 cubic meters and they only occupy 1.5 cubic meters of space
---
Just wait. 
---

Are you factoring in labor cost server cost the cost of all the markets involved 
---
Killed her yesterday. Got nothing. Not one single item..... 
---
Hopefully it’s not plagued with griefers on launch
---
I’ve transferred items dozens of times, guess it’s easier to defend a ridiculous trading method than ask for a new one? 
---
Recently when killing ghouls there seem to be ones (usually withered ghouls) that have 2 of each chem (at least 5 or 6 different types of chem). Idk if this is intentional or not but I find it odd that it just started happening. They're caps goldmines
---
We are starting to fill up so inbox me as soon as you can if you are going to make it! Right now the pot is over 2,000 caps
---
I've transferred stuff like 50-100 fatmans, 500 missiless, 1-2k granade launcher ammo, and several two stars on same time. On my first muling try, I even severly overloaded the level 4 mule, not being able to carry all that I left for it to carry, because I didn't realize how little it can carry without any weight perks.
---
Both you and I have taken far too high risks.
---
Yes we should have something to not to do stupid stuff like this.
---
I agree. Up untill this Pay2Win stuff i was actually pretty happy with where the game was going. Yeah the release was a disaster, but i thought the game was recovering pretty well up untill now...
---
Oh cool thanks I'll treat gaz well. (I named him gaz)
---
I just hope it's not something I can outlevel quickly. I'm gunna be dissapointed if I end up like 20 levels above everything in there
---
All I am simply saying is it does cost more for them to make the game and no it doesn't bother me if they put stuff I don't need in the shop for real money 
---
It’s only a level 35 so I can sell it to you for 750 caps instead. Gt is doubleA3455
---
Yeah 
---
I don't know how you lumped all Americans together like that, but you are wrong.
---
I'm sorry you're a dick.
---
Dear God please even if it's just holding a gun while sitting. Seems like a lot of coding tho.
---
Buy the plan, build a bunch with super duper on, scrap them. Tried and true method. 
---
I don't think any of what I said is stupid and if you haven't put hundreds of hours to researching the game and if you are not freely farming caps from people with assassin sentinel TSE builds then you are not in a position to tell me what's stupid because these people to me are food.
---
Yip, sipping shine and shootin from a chair while playing a Pip-Boy game...no better life to be had.  
---
I've played like 300+ hours and I don't think I've seen/ noticed any behemoths
---
Just because it worked before for you doesn't mean much considering recent events eh?
---
It's ok to ask for a new one, but you are also trying to avoid blame.
---
Praise the Lord - not.
---
Bounty hunt in survival, I make about 2k a day doing it. Keep in mind you can lose more than that 
---
I just scrap absolutely everything, and since I make my own stimpacks and ammo (usually thousands of 5.56 or .45) that tends to keep the steel, water, and all that kind of weight down.
---
I was leveling an alternate character (180+ main)  recently and my time was spent either on WS or west tek most of the time. There was this level 50+ guy who bullied my level 16 alt repeatedly. He was attacking me, waiting for ghouls to kill me to take my loot and then attack me again. I went to voice and told him to stop but he continuously harassed my alt. He even teabagged me when I died. So I invited a friend to server to mark it, switched to my main and confronted him near the station. He instantly started attacking as he saw me which made it an easy job for my bloodied build. But I really wanted him to learn a lesson so I waited him to fast travel to somewhere middle of nowhere and found his camp. Destroyed even the smallest thing in there.
---
I never am a bully and never intentionally attack someone’s camp for fun. But having my low level alt bullied by some stranger pissed me off. He had to learn a lesson to be more polite and I’m sure he got what he deserved that day. 
---
Ah yes, with those perks 1000 lead turns into roughly 3500 rounds. That’s probably enough. 
---
The .50 cal ammo is more lead efficient (1000 lead turns into 23k rounds) but hey life is about more than pure efficiency.
---
Inability to adapt to the new system of weight management vs previous Fallout titles. I took a great deal of joy in the tons of souvenirs I collected during my travels. They didn't serve much propose, they weren't usually helpful, but they were mine.  I've been playing since the beta and just yesterday I finally created a mule so that I could off load several hundred pounds of junk and gear that I've deemed too valuable to discard, but that aren't essential. With all the stuff I've discarded, mostly 1* legendaries deposited into the ice machine outside the whitesprings train station, I could have filled two more mules. My only regret is that I didn't create a mule sooner.
---
Oh and absolutely no fusion cores or missiles are allowed! They weigh too much to keep them stashed away!
---
When something like that happens I immediately exit that server. I know it’s too late now but for future reference, just try to get to the main menu as fast as you can.  
---
What do you mean
---
I live 20 minutes from Camden Park. Can I borrow that Gas Mask?
---
Oh ok, I had no idea 
---
So you work at BGS now you have seen there payroll and worked with the devs and spent 1 minute as you say making the skin. No you didn't let alone you didn't make the game. I do know about coding and yes some things are a simple stroke of the key but that stroke cost alot of real money. 
---
Yeah I've been stashing up a couple for the new vendor thats getting released soon
---
Sorry I’m looking for 45 and up level on the weapon
---
Fuckin building inspectors man god damn
---
I'm sorry you're also a dick.
---
This is how I learned lol
---
Bring me cloth I'll make u hats
---
Live and learn
---
I’m looking for it as well. It requires some hefty surveying jobs and my solution is to mark the places near my camp so that I can do a quick run to gather what I need. Savage divide is gold for random rock resources 
---
I wish I had that much junk lol, I'm constantly running out of steel, springs, and screws 
---
You can't seriously believe that they charge you this to break even. The made a shitton of profits on the sales alone even when the game sold less than the previous. These outragipus microtransactions that charge you 10+ dollars for a single low effort skin are just a cash grab ordered by the stake holders who fill their pockets with cash while the developers are underpaid.
---
I just wish they used a hammer instead, y'know? Gentler on the eardrums.
---
OH lol I read that wrong
---
Personally, I think some people are overreacting.
---
A: a better version will be available only as an ingame drop.
---
B: the atom price seems easily attainable through daily/ weekly challenges.
---
C: convenience does not equal a competitive advantage 
---
Drug addicted knifer
---
I've been doing that for awhile lol
---
When this happens to me, I go to the main menu and then go into the atom shop for a minute or so. Usually puts me in a different server after that. 
---
You can get prime plans from any scorched beast. I ran line in the sand over and over again to get my prime handmade plans.
---
If I get the message that the game can't place my camp, I choose to stay in that world instead of moving to an open one. I then locate the person who took my camp spot and I teach them a lesson by leveling their camp. Usually do it up to the 200 bounty mark.  I make sure to drop my junk inventory first. It's fun, I laugh, they leave, I find a new server to play the game in. 
---
Other times I will open the map and look at it for a few minutes. When you see players hanging out in the middle of knowhwere, it's a good indication that is where their camp is, and there is usually some fun and LOLs to be had. 
---
Well, I wouldn’t let the opinion of an 8 year old depict the opinions of “younger gamers” as a whole.
---
I’ll do that next time. I thought I had it under control but I guess if you re-enter too soon it takes you back to the same server?
---
It's good to now know that the Tech Data being that you could only have 1 on hand to turn in, as I thought it was a glitch. It being a quest item does make sense, but not entirely, given plenty of quests have multiple turn in items. Shame it's that way, as I gave my friend 10 on her main account and so they'll probably have converted into a single item :( 
---
EITHER WAY... regarding your question... On my main I had thought this issue was due to the TD in Enclave Bunker being glitched, so on my Alt I had been avoiding looting any from there. Now that I know she can since she doesn't have the quest... I'll start tracking that.
---
What I can say is that on my main it seemed like it would respawn. However, with there being so many desks in there, and the fact I never bothered to track this metric, I can't say if they have ever been in the \*\*same\*\* desk or not. I feel like it'd be safe to say I might have at least looted \*one\* from the same desk though...
---
I'll try and pay attention to where they're coming from to help out. Might make a small paper diagram of that room and add hash-marks to the desks that produce Technical Data for me. :)
---
Desk fans are your friends! Farm the Military Wing of the whitespring bunker always 4-6 fans in there
---
There seems to be no sweet spot between enemies taking an unfun amount of time to kill and just oneshotting them. Basically, go melee to kill things fast. Every other playstyle then becomes boring and tedious, though. It's this reason I rarely visit the right side of the map except with my 500dmg powerfist guy. It's just not fun. 
---
Keep in mind they make things for the wider, more causal gamer to be able to do, so hardcore reddit gamers will probably breeze through most of the new stuff unfortunately simply because we spend too long playing and setting up characters specifically for certain things.  
---
The thing to keep in mind is that a lot of the devs have about 100 hours in game, I personally have 450 hours in game and im probably on the low end seeing as how i play with several people who have just topped 1000 hours.  
---
So someone who has only played 100 hours something thats hard for them might be a piece of cake to someone with 700 hours.  
---
However, I would be happy to be wrong on this, I hope its extremely hard and I die repeatedly trying to every finish it
---
Okay well how do I get the plan?
---
Whoa did not know this! Pumped for sure
---
You only think about yourself and as I already stated the consequences of implementing your shortsighted egocentric idea would be that it'd abused to negate tactical advantages. Your suggestion would make survival worse and more prone to griefing. I am against spawn killing hence I don't do that. I don't like being spawn killed so I barely fast travel to unscouted stations and mainly move on foot. Git gud.
---
What is bullshit is when noobs that don't have any idea on how to dominate in this game come up with idiotic ideas that would only result in the proposed systems being abused. What is bullshit is people like you thinking they are experts on things they have no idea about. Disgusting.
---
The whole “it isn’t personal, it’s just business” saying is bullshit. Of course it’s personal. They flat out lied and if they make the game free, they stole our money. That’s personal.
---
Yeah same, I can run a silo in 13-16 minutes solo, lag depending
---
Ive been playing since the beta consistantly almost everyday, but until like 3 days ago i never saw a Flatwoods monster. I took a black and white photo that made it seem really mysterious.
---
Lmao, no shame no shame
---
and the horde events that spawn after never have legendary boss come on....
---
This is assuming two very questionable things. One, this should be considered a AAA title, and two, it's worth$60, to begin with. 
---
You not collect weapons and armour? 
---
&gt; Stop talking shit out of your ass please.
---
Which part are you challenging? That call of Duty was $60 back in 2003 when it was released, or that the cumulative inflation rate from 2003 to 2019 is 37.4%?
---
&gt;A new Wild Appalachia dungeon experience, The Burrows, will become available for the heartiest of explorers **starting April 16**. Muster your squad and follow in the footsteps of the Brotherhood of Steel who sent their own forces into the darkness and muck below Harper’s Ferry for mysterious reasons. We’ll share more details about The Burrows in next week’s Inside the Vault, but we thought you might like this heads-up so you can get your characters prepped for this daunting new subterranean battleground.   
---
From the latest Inside The Vault
---
Interesting!
---
How do you back up into it?  
---
I can imagine going from collecting snowglobes in the Mojave to fighting scorched in Appalachia can do that to a person lol
---
Would love this.
---
It's below Harpers ferry. Some player had about month ago accidentally fast travelled into it.
---
But then YouTube will just overflow with people saying Bethesda allowing racist bigotry to harm its playerbase is pay-to-win...
---
No, deluxe will be obtained in-game. Normal is obtained through the atom shop.
---
The real news here is that someone out there is actually using missiles. 
---
Yeah because they panicked over small things
---
500 caps each?
---
That’s one of the reason I thought it was nuts. Who could carry so many missiles?!
---
I cant believe OP didnt try to bribe him. Thats all he was looking for.
---
First off you do get notified if someone attacking you camp similar to when you drop your stuff and you will notice a marker on your camp when its attacked. Secondly its really fun and profitable to destroy players camps. The trick is to make them mad so they pvp you, for example this one players camp I found I destroyed it all and he found out and I killed him 4 times thanks to my unkillable melee build then he left so I following him second server and smashed his decontamination shower and he was yelling in his mic and trying to kill me 9 more times. It was great  that encounter alone got me 1,200+ caps and farming a day like that got me enough caps to max me to 25k caps and didnt even notice till the following day when I started players and went on a shopping spree.
---
But yea sad they removing the option for destroying peoples bases but the next best way to force players into pvp in adventure mode is using workshops but this way requires you have a partner, most players have it for easy plans so you wont expect much fight in them. First you have your partner in crime at the workshop they own and 2nd player me goes to that players location where ever they be and once your friend starts the counter claim the owner can take full damage from me and I 3 punch him to death and we get the caps based on what lvl he is, best part most players owning workshops have pacfist mode on so they can't fight back till they turn it off and that takes about 2 mins more then enough time for me to kill him for his caps but you don't want to stop there, tbagging and saying mean things through the mic will make them try and come back for a rematch, this one guy I did it to gave me 2000 caps and thats not including what my partner gets as caps from pvp kills is shared among team members, after I killed I took his bag of junk about 50+ stable fluxes and he was pissed and kept coming at me crying and trying to kill me in pvp, he eventually gave up and exited game and I literally tossed those fluxes on the floor since I had no room in stash box lol.
---
yeah
---
Nope, I've only recently started collecting legendaries after hearing about the legendary vendor 
---
Hey, I'm from Kentucky, damnit!
---
Why does that matter? Turret kills don't give XP if I'm not mistaken, not arguing just curious bc I have seen this many times and always wonder WHY
---
Yes for sure. 
---
Normally I’d be surprised that something like this wasn’t added to a game like this. It would have such massive benefit and require so little effort that it seems absurd that it wasn’t added in. But if you were around for the launch like I was, and know that they’ve missed other obvious things like having a slider for crafting, etc, it’s not much of a surprise lol.
---
They're not doing themselves a service by taking items out of circulation, even temporarily.  We need a larger array of items to choose from, and creating artificial scarcity just limits whatever you've made.  
---
Maybe there are people who really go for the branded stuff, but I really don't see why we need so many in-game brand reskins of things.  Vault-tec, Nuka Cola, etc..  People probably want to see completely new stuff, and if you do reskin items, at least make it something I'm sure there is a larger audience for.  I know I like the idea of pristine versions of certain items, like what was doing with the clean water purifier on the Atomic Shop.
---
Is this a thing , pretty sure everything a player does is saved to Bethesdas server automatically. 
---
I want to be able to shoot while sitting. So I can sit on that mountaintop looking all drowsy and then bham!
---
I'd rather have them and never need them, than need them and not have them!
---
..at least that's what I tell myself..
---
Yeah I just built a new CAMP on an acid extractor so I'm more in the market for raw ore nodes now with my excavator armour
---
Don’t let it get to you.  Just quickly exit as others have posted already.  It rarely happens to me in Adventure mode.  Mines kinda out of the way, I rarely get visitors.
---
Are you on PC?  Shoot me pm here and I’ll help you rebuild 
---
I used to. With ordinance, I'd run around with 200+ missiles and shoot shit. I ran a bloodied vats crit homing missile launcher, with almost 0 up.
---
Shit was fookin bonkers mate
---
Harper's Ferry having so many footlockers, safes, and filing cabinets/desks (specifically this) means it has has high likelihood to produce them. I'll go log in and try to get a tally on the containers there. (since you only noted locked ones)
---
Another location with a high count of safes is Lewisberg, in the Ash Heap. Specifically the small graveyard to the North-West, which has about 4-5 safes, all of which are level 3! In town, there are a couple more strewn about as I recall, only lvl 1 and 2. I think most of these are wall-safes though. Some of the buildings have some filing cabinets and desks also, raising one's chances further.
---
People have said that it's Charisma that improves your loot from quests/events, not Luck. Given both of my characters have relatively low of each, I can't really say as to the impact :\\
---
Actualy, those were the assumptions from Wherabo.  My postulations were that COD is a AAA game and it was $60 back in 2003.
---
I wouldn't pay $60 for FO76, but i'm a cheapskate and usually wait for them to drop in price anyway. My copy of FO76 came with my wife's new Xbox I bought her for an early Christmas gift.
---
Any chance you have targeting hud on your PA helmet? I ran into something similar a few days ago and found out my targeting hud was causing it.
---
Enclave vendor, by the WS service entrance, I think
---
Cookie cutters are bad for business.
---
Yeah, keep the faith man. 
---
Yes indeed, fixed. 
---
Don't say it loud. People are not liking criticizing their game. 
---
Atleast it was someone with true dedication to his job. He is doing it even after the apocalypse... just with radical Solutions xD
---
It’s a slippery slope. 
---
If you’re referring to the secret ending speculation , then it’s not the goal because there’s no secret ending 😔
---
&gt; the real goal is to close the main fissure site , which is named *Fissure site prime* 
---
&gt;all the other fissure sites don’t really have much relevance.
---
😂😂😂😂😂
---
To Much Walking dead I guess :)
---
So did you lose the recipes you bought or not? 
---
Disconnects actually haven’t been happening to me lately. They used to happen literally every 10-30 minutes, a few months ago, sometimes even more frequent than 10 minutes. It was disgusting. It hasn’t happened once in the 30 odd hours I’ve played recently. I have crashed about 6 times which is pretty fucked up, but not actual disconnects like before.
---
Shouldn't you see if you lost the recipes and/or caps BEFORE posting this kind of thing. Like you couldn't wait two minutes... 
---
Because the turrets kill off the ghouls that other players are trying to farm, so that CAMP even existing there is stopping anyone else on the server from farming ghoul at the whitesprings clubhouse.
---
The game does auto save. But you don't know _when_ it auto saves. The only real way to be sure you auto saved is to fast-travel or save and exit. 
---
Worse, there's a "inventory roll back" feature which I'm not sure is in play or not that was used in the event of sudden disconnects. 
---
I'm currently sitting waiting out the log out timer. One of three things will happen, when I log back in. 1) best case, I have the shit I paid for. 2) second best case, I don't  have the shit, but I do have my caps back. 3) most likely, I've lost my caps AND my shit. 
---
So just to double on being an asshole pretty much??
---
There's a guaranteed spawn (from my experience) for a Hermit Crab on the Highway alongside Thunder Mountain. Last two times I've been past it has been Scorched
---
The issue is the _fucking bug that's got me locked in a fucking workshop_. 
---
YouTube thumbnail graphics looking cringy af like usual
---
To get a duplicate you simply don't learn the plan until a 2nd one drops.  As soon as you learn it, it wont drop again and you can drop the next level. 
---
Waiting out the log out timer, to give myself the best shot at the game randomly auto saving my progress. 
---
I saw that the other day.  I don’t know why, but it really creeps me out over everything else in this game except for the wendigos. Wendigos are pure evil.
---
And by "Simply" I mean pour hours of game time into grinding the shit out of tech data.
---
It has been ages since I've seen the SBQ get nuked because of this.
---
I agree. The least they could do is give you notice that your camp is under attack, like they do workshops
---
This is just close minded of you to say. I've played over 400 hours now and have not had a single tse, explosive, or even ordinary two shot weapon drop from a legendary enemy, outside of a nuke zone or otherwise. To say that people aren't playing the game right is just ludicrous. (Terrible grammar by the way, I hope English isn't your first language)  
---
I agree.
---
Hi Stormborn1776, my PSN is cxmgamingKR2. I sent you a reqest, if your PSN is the same as your reddit name. I’ll give you caps for your time.
---
I've not seen that drop from Tech Data. I'm afraid I don't know where or how that spawns into the world. 
---
Id see em occasionally by the lake near Lewisburg station
---
It saves at points. I killed a sbq got my plans and got disconnected a few seconds later. Log back in, no plans in my inventory. So its very frustrating and possible to get an item be booted from the world and you have no item and your caps and ammo are gone too.
---
I really hope Bethesda sees this comment and realizes "wow we made an event for the whole server to participate in" only to see that this is the only way to get rewarded 🙄
---
I'd face a room full of wendigos, just keep those f#$&amp;in' squirrels away from me!
---
If noone else appreciates this. I do.
---
Pro-tip, if a YouTube video ever puts a picture of Todd as the thumbnail just block the channel. You're algorithm will greatly improve.
---
The part where the costs did go up but so did the profits, games in the 90's that sold 1 million where considered a success that almost no one could achieve, a triple A like the tomb raider reboot sold 3 million and it was considered a failure.
---
Are you that innocent to actually think the companies are selling games at 60 at a loss or for charity? The games industry made 100 billion dollars in 2017, the industry is insanely big and 60 dollars is not even the default price anymore. How delusional can one be to think that a company will stop at some profit.
---
They want all the profit, but yeah, buying a unfinished game at 60 bucks and then having to pay to have the game finished is the future.
---
And I can bet that Bethesda made the return just with the launch sales, and considering the state of the game they shouldn't receive not one cent more.
---
If FO76 was a ftp game I would have had no problem with the ingame shop. PoE has one and i've sunk 6-7k hours in it and dropped maybe £100 all in all. Devs deserved every penny.
---
But an item shop in a £60 game? Yeah no.
---
There is absolutely no indication that they are increasing the wear of weapons anytime soon.  And I would say you are more likely to see double XP events to bring back or entice players than a ninja XP reduction. I dont know what it is with the fallout community but it's like you are all a bunch of gamer socialist liberals who expect all video game companies to give you everything for free and never make you pay for a single DLC or extra content. Please explain to me how the game company is supposed to make money?
---
I think it has something to do with this tweet, but I really don't know. [https://twitter.com/bethesda/status/1107661942645276672](https://twitter.com/bethesda/status/1107661942645276672)
---
Well that's case in point for why almost everyone here has a full stash, junk for crafting/fixing. I for one also collect named legendaries and use multiple weapons and as such need the ammo to match
---
drug addicts, whitesprings has alot of those
---
I almost said that too. I don't think it was designed for people to even have mules and unload dramatic amounts of crap on different characters. It bugs me but I just have to say okay, people will play how they want. It's just that in my experience I haven't seen a good *half* of the game yet, I'm level 105 on one character, stash is about 650/800, and I don't have that start-over-itis because I can change my appearance at any time. Starting a different build or different type of character? Cool. Existing to unload and shuffle around crap? Why put yourself through that boring grind?
---
Like I said though, to each their own. Where I won't mince words is people who carry 2000 pounds and die to fast travel. More than one of these and you're breaking the game for others when you put that stress on the server. Sometimes the lag in these games just collecting water is so extreme.
---
I don’t only think about myself. My friend actually suggested this idea. I don’t think it would be abused because if they made the parley 5-10 minutes people would loose interest. And I’m not a noob and I don’t think I’m an expert I just am smarter than you.
---
1 rank triggers at 20%, which I think is still too high, but 3 ranks is at 40% health. 1 rank will help you save on stimpacks and only use them when absolutely necessary. So long story short, use one rank. (Also I'm not that original guy who responded, I hope you're fine with me budging in)
---
&gt;WS 
---
Okay so I just need super dupper...
---
I want this implemented, but after they expand the no build areas to the golf club and Charleston train yard. 
---
Grind those levels! :) good luck
---
After you said all that I just realized that Fallout 76 doesn't have a lot of things that other MMOs have. 
---
No account stash, no text chat, no mailing system, no auction house, no system to trade items for items (it always have to be item for caps; we need a trustworthy 3rd person to do item for item trading), no account restore (if you lose an item, or even worse you got hacked... they don't have a way to restore your stuffs) They'd suggest you to start over lol.
---
That’s a real nice , creative base dude nice 
---
And for some reason the solid lead cannon balls explode on impact.
---
Griefing a griefer is the best reason to level a camp. 
---
I'm excited but maybe you guys can clear this up for me. How is it different from the dungeons in the base game? I hope it's not super short like some of those. Is it instanced? The others aren't? And idk if anyone has the answers for this but how does this differ from say the vault raids that are coming? 
---
Oh, you also need some of the science energy weapon cards lol. 
---
I work at Watoga State Park, come on by! It's not anything like the game's version, except we are all robots. :P
---
i thought it was weird that the only enclave power armor paint we got was the prototype paint, would’ve been really cool to get a proper paint job as a reward for doing your first nuke and completing the quest, especially since you have to be in the enclave to be able to go into silos
---
This was in a nuke zone but I might have to check that out now!
---
For sure they refill on my main character.  What I am going to test tomorrow is the theory that its not time based, but based on whats currently filled in the world.  
---
For example, say there is 10 containers in the world, and at any given time only 7 can be filled and 3 is empty.  
---
 If I loot 3 of the 7, this will refill the 3 empty ones.  
---
 The 3 I have looted will never refill until I have looted from the other containers.  
---
I hope this makes sense.  
---
I can see them doing it this way to stop people like me free grinding the desks at the bunker. 
---
If I’m not mistaken it isn’t even out yet, they still have time to fix it. It is one thing to voice your opinion asking them to re think but videos like don’t do anything but breed hate. They have been doing a lot of good things lately and deserve recognition for that to but people only care about the negative. There are tons of people who have heard the hate and then decided not to get the game only to get it and realize that they love it and it is sad that people can be influenced from just titles of videos alone without even watching and decided that it isn’t for them.
---
pfft we killed sbq today, she turned into plasma and fell underground i can honestly say everyone there was thrilled.
---
I actually love this, thanks for sharing! :)
---
That really sucks
---
I'd try the flooded trainyard by Watoga Station
---
Push those old world commies out of Appalachia, Ad Victoriam! (More seriously though, it would be cool to have it)
---
It can. I find that really unreliable, but when it happens in a situation like that is *sucks*. I know you said you blocked him but it must've bugged out, maybe you rejoined too quickly. You did the right thing. Block for session (I'd follow suit with their GT or PSN if you're on console) then leave the game. Should stop you from ending up with them again.
---
I role play as a pissed off utility contractor there to shut off power. 
---
You can get them at the workshop near hemlock holes. 
---
You still selling it ?
---
Yeah I haven't seen a Hermit Crab in a Nuke Zone, but then I've only done a handful
---
I agree it would be cool to have a set of Riot armor in considering what's going in the U.S. at the time. I mean in every fallout games they mention protest and you see the remnants of the protesters or police/military.  The riot gear also had unique helmets with one including night vision if I remember correctly. Then we have the combat helmet from Fallout 4 and 76 where there is clearly a light on it but we can't use which is absolutely stupid. At least in 4 you can get mods to make it functional. I just liked NV because you had some sense of how Firearms actually work, for instance you had different types of ammo like Hollow-points and armor piercing along with slugs which makes sense if your hunting. I don't know maybe it just bugs me that in four and 76 they  don't have firearms that make sense. Also why is there no Dynamite in WV even though there are mines and stuff that points to dynamite being used?
---
If your CAMP is at the golf club or Charleston station. Your just asking for it. Anyone who does that ruins the experience for other players. By destroying their CAMPs, it is just going full circle. 
---
They have the same thing in the Far Harbor expansion, except you actually fight it. 
---
White knight only normal. Swap it in to repair. 
---
You're going to want to swap in several as you raft/repair but dont need them initially ... Weapon Artisan, Power Patcher, Fix It Good, Chemist, Ammosmith, Super Duper. Those can come later but you do eventually want them.
---
You can get by without concentrated fire. It's not bad to go 15 there in Perception though as you have good swaps like Glow Sighted, Green Thumb even if you rarely use concentrated fire.
---
The most useful likely weight reduction perks are Thru Hiker (food, including flux), Traveling Pharmacy but that's in Strength so avoid. Another to consider is Batteries Included in Inteligence as it will drop Fusion Core weight and Gauss EC rounds plus Fusion Cells if you find you are using lasers or Tesla rifles. Thru Hiker can be useful with all the alcohol crafting right now. 
---
Everything will get better after the Legendary vendor is released. No one really knows how it works so people are girding junk or semi-junk legendaries 
---
That is the worst! I love the SBQ fight, but its terrible when you do not get the loot. 
---
Have same character set up, have same problems, and have same frustrations.
---
There’s still base damage in adventure mode? I’m on pc and it’s gone, I shot a tse at a white springs camp and it did nothing as a test. 
---
Because they lack the skills to actually PVP. That's the point. They're trash at skilled play. Shooting a wall is mindless and easy. 
---
Here's one I made for my posts. 
---
https://i.redd.it/jbtygyxyw5q21.jpg
---
Why did you make this post before you even actually lost the stuff???
---
Thanks, I appreciate the advice. A friend also informed me that serendipity doesn't work with power armor so I think I'll ditch that and 2 ranks of born survivor for adrenaline.
---
Windego cave has a few i think
---
No. You are making the issue that you lost all your  stuff. But you didn’t yet. 
---
Now you are just being extreme all because you expect gaming companies to provide all content for free and cant understand why they need to make money. You do realize the servers cost money to keep up and employees must be paid. If you feel so strongly about it I am willing to bet you 500 dollars right now that in one year from today you will not be able to buy a TSE handmade  for atoms in the atom shop
---
Worst part is that even this method isn't sure to get you your loot. I actually did this earlier today and then had the game crash on me soon as the queens inventory showed up...
---
 Not lying, I'd buy that shit
---
I'm sitting here, waiting for the game to auto log me out on the thin hope that I MIGHT not loose my shit, due to a bug that's been around since launch that should have been a high priority. 
---
The risk in this case is more than usual, but the issue as a whole is the _fucking bug_. 
---
Lol, where did you come up with any of that rant from my comment?
---
I said a $60 game today is comparatively less expensive for the end-user than a $60 game was 15 years ago due to inflation. I didn't even mention if a game was a success or not, or what their profit margins are.
---
I usually either find a new server or kill them over and over if I’m short on caps and want to make some quick. Take comfort in knowing that a mentally healthy human being would not behave like them. Either they’re in their early or pre teens, or depressed/psychotic adults.
---
No. I'm mad at a fucking shitty bug that shouldn't be in the game. I'm madder than normal due to the unusual high risk, but this bug is a big fucking problem, ten thousand caps worth of shit on the line or not. 
---
honestly the worst part about being stuck is [I could only turn](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D3b_UoRW4AISiZX.png), not actually move at all. I was legitimately stuck til I TP'd out. It was quite claustrophobic!
---
oh thank you! ehh bummer. i expected it on 9th xD
---
I made the new character specifically for the radium rifle I lost &gt;x( ... time to take out my anger with some explosive .50 cal 
---
Let's hope that they did lose them. At least it gives us a reason to have a good laugh at these losers who post crap like this.
---
A 15 minute rant video of information that’s already circulating around this subreddit. Why do you guys post these stupid YouTube videos as if they’re groundbreaking news? Is this just an attempt to help get the content creator views or something? 
---
Yup
---
hello am serching 3\* pickaxe with or medic or anti-armor on xbox some one cal help ?
---
I'm thinking you need cavalier assassin's armor so you get both the 15% damage reduction from cavalier while sprinting around meleeing (always keep movingl and the 8% damage reduction from players. This is per piece of this type of armor you have. Run with 4 of those and one piece of chameleon so they can't VATS you and you'd be set. 92% incoming damage reduction and no more easy VATS shots. 
---
I love the ideas of notes or signs.
---
I wouldn't say it is set in stone. They said it was on the wish list.
---
Rather than longer lasting CAMPs. I wish they would let us build two instead.
---
Wow. That's trash. 
---
How do you know of Chapmanville? 
---
Cool. I'll look around the market for some
---
I have all those the issue is super duper.
---
I role play as a pissed off utility contractor there to disconnect their power for no pay. 
---
..it shouldn't be too hard to give Rose some extra responsibility in hosting a radio show..
---
It’s pay2perceive 😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
My base luck is level 10 + 2 (Shielded Vault Underarmor) for a total of 12.
---
I buy shit and force close my game all the time. You’re just bitching to bitch without even knowing if you lost anything. The game hangs and crashes all the time. We already know that. This is just flat out click bait complaining. If you’re tired of crashes then complain about crashes. 
---
If it helps, there's something like 10 bags of cement at the top of the Monorail Elevator.
---
But.... Its not pay to win.
---
Why not both?
---
One's clean and one is dirty. You can't see as well out of a dirty helmet. But, you can get the clean one in game as well as in the AS. 
---
Adrenaline is good for PVE but not as good for PVP. You'll almost never find enough people for max adrenaline but NPCs often travel in groups. 
---
Lmao this post 
---
I can't even work out the infinitesimal small chance of not dropping paint after 300 submissions. 
---
 If anyone has access to a super computer the chance of not dropping is - 
---
19 to the power of 300 divided by 20 to the power of 300 * 100
---
It'll be something like 99.999997% chance of dropping.  (At 200 the chance of dropping is 99.997)
---
 Of course this relies solely on my data, I could of been super lucky. 
---
MAYBE IF YOU ALLOWED THE DEVS TO PUSH REPAIR KITS THEY WOULD HE ABLE TO AFFORD THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS FEATURE
---
Hoping it’s geared towards end game. That’s what they make it sound like. 
---
Bummer. The only reason I'm turning it in is because another thread indicated that's the only known drop location.
---
Legacy killer is like in 1st class on the hate train. Just look at each video he uploads. When he has nothing to upload he makes up a story about how a company banned him from getting early copies of their game.
---
Disrespect is disrespect. If someone I knew but wasn’t friends with somehow found my camp in Fallout 76 and destroyed say 10 turrets, a rad shower and some other expensive things, just enough to inconvenience me simply to annoy you, I’d probably punch them full on the next time I saw them. Not everyone would but I don’t see it as a sign of needing to grow up. Most people will get violent if they get annoyed in some way. They just express it differently. I express it physically.
---
Which is also not true as wages also haven't gone up that much, and the fact that games are a luxury good so people will drop this hobby if it gets too expensive, also deluxe editions and up are the norm and make even more profit
---
Ummm... Legendsries and hundreds of pounfs,of junk
---
Whoa, reel it in. Not like I'm leading a crusade against the dev team here. Chill with the caps lock.
---
Amen. Maybe I'm to old but I understand what happened to finding a game you like and then play said game. When you stop liking it you moved on to a new game. Now the trend is bitch about a game from beta to post release and try to get everyone on forums/reddit to agree with your complaints because you falsely believe that the gaming companies are going to bend to your will and give everything away for free.
---
Go to clarksburg, you might run into some
---
Same as mine then. 
---
Well good luck man. You seem very angry so for your own mental wellbeing I hope it’s all good.
---
I’ve heard that all you have to do is move your camp and it will repair everything for you without making you hunt for all the materials needed, you’ll just be out caps.
---
Plastic? Where's the plastic?! I NEED PLASTIC THIS SHOTGUN WON'T STAY FED UNLESS I HAVE ALL OF THE PLASTIC! 
---
You can do it without super duper but it’s nice to get the bonus guns every once in awhile. 
---
I kinda like the wendigo, wish they were a little more common.  For some reason deathclaws feel oddly underpowered in 76.  They're bullet sponges, but otherwise don't feel terribly dangerous. Wendigos fill that niche pretty well though.
---
My favorite encounter so far was making my way up some switchbacks in brand new Excavator armor, all alone in the wilderness.  Not even regular fauna. Just a peaceful hike. 
---
Round a turn, and 20 feet away is a wendigo in the middle of the road. It spreads its arms and roars, I say "Fuck it, let's do this" and pull out my shotgun. Battle lead us up and down a couple of the switchbacks for a good 5 minutes. 
---
I'd suggest Strange in Numbers and Party Boy/Girl. I like to carry a ton of Whiskey, with Party Boy/Girl at max it gives you +6 Strength.
---
I've the clean helmet (non atomic shop) in game and it's -2 perception.
---
There is a few good cap stash routes that get me well over 1,000 caps. Sadly it only refreshes every couple of days or so. 
---
I got it from uranium fever but ive heard it drop from events in the mire
---
yes. A bug happened at the exact worst moment for me. I'm a bit mad about it. 
---
Rookie time
---
Plus, pick up the guns and sell em. 
---
It's been datamined that it cannot be.  You must have had the BOS Chest Mod already learned before it.
---
Lol I know I have shit RNG luck, it took me 250 server hops to get a set of calibrated shocks before you could just buy the plan.
---
&gt; Which is also not true as wages also haven't gone up that much, and the fact that games are a luxury good so people will drop this hobby if it gets too expensive, also deluxe editions and up are the norm and make even more profit
---
So your argument is that inflation has not gone up 37.4% in the past 15 years?
---
You got it mostly right, only thing I wanted to add is that the watoga station vendor bot is not of the responder faction afaik. Here's a breakdown of what factions the bots are:
---
Responders Faction Vendors
---
Camden park
---
Charleston Fire Department
---
Charleston Station
---
Flatwoods
---
Grafton Station
---
Lewisburg Station
---

Grahm the traveling Super Mutant merchant
---
I've added Lewisburg, let me know about Harpers, I'll look as well tomorrow, not found any there before, but I have not been looking hard. 
---
 Thanks!
---
OP must be one of them anti-straw people.
---
Let me tell you what, America litters VERY little compared to Asian countries.  I want to keep my staws, thank you.  
---
I wish I were joking. Maybe if Bethesda reads this they will give me a pity roll, lol.
---
Where do you get the civil war hat plan?
---
Right? Plus after you remove the prototype paint you cant put it back on which sucks lol
---
Pretty cool
---
There used to be a trade bug. I think it was something along the lines of being able to set prices and force a trade for any item without the other players input, so long as both players had the trade menu open. Maybe this is another bug.
---
I’m not really a fan of using experience exploits or others “cheats” to cut out the time part of playing the game, but I can understand why people would use them. Straight up stealing, though, is fucked.
---
I’m down to play. Can’t really get on mic on weekends though with my kids running through the house screaming lol 
---
Where do you get them?
---
I've been on several SBQ hunting parties and I've found similar results. I have ended up with 2 and 3 duplicates of plans I already got. Send like an absolute collosal waste of resources.
---
Max 15 I think
---
Same shit happens to me a lot
---
I saw a Flatwoods monster on my first day in the beta.  Actually it was 3 of them.  At the overseer's camp near Flatwoods. They were level 30, I was level 2.  I stayed crouched and just backed away. Finished that quest another day. 
---
Yeah, I personally just want to put an Enclave flag in my C.A.M.P
---
A different build might be a possibility for me but im just level 96 and keep changing aspects of my build every lvs.
---
And weight limit for me is not a problem since I only keep what I need( aside fastnatch limited masks)
---
I hord adhesive, you never know when you need it. (No you can't have it, it's mine. Lol)
---
I even saw a level 2 near Whitesprings
---
Its obtainable in game.
---
Currently taking bets on both whether or not there will be bugs allowing players to steal items for free and how many of these bugs there will be. Minimum 500 caps.
---
Nice.  I got them all myself, but I don't have a suit of T-60, been rolling with my X01 (luckily I was able to find two Calibrated Shocks so I have it decked out nicely).
---
I think Paladin looks the best, myself.  Though with Paladin labelled BOS V and Elder labelled BOS VII, I wonder if we were supposed to have Sentinel in there as BOS VI somewhere?
---
Ima steal it then lol
---
It would be great if we could make customized flags, any we want.
---
Your IGN? i will take it
---
I'd love to have a smiling MODUS mask..I'd give half my stash for that!
---
I sell stimpacks.
---
Once you have the plan, I got the butchers bounty at max rank then go to cabin below vault 76 and kill the ticks. Then kill the ticks at the lumber mill just south.
---
With the tick blood you can make blood packs. Then you can craft stimpacks. With the super duper card maxed and chemist card, that is a lot of stimpacks. I sell them. Plus you can server hop the ticks. 
---
I feel your pain. I've still yet to see a set of X-01 Calibrated outside of trading subs. 
---
 Everyday at least once, most times multiple tries since I had access to the enclave in December. Would love to know the mechanics behind that %. 
---
The ammo factory can
---
Yes.  You take a workshop you will die....  Eventually.  I usually take a workshop.  Hide and when eventually get challenged by some PVP reject from Survival, I  Just block them for the evening and change servers. I Use it like a timer.  Take a new workshop and keep going until I get the set amount I need. It's all within the rules so I don't get too excited about getting challenged, just treat them like any worthless parasite in the real world and move on. I'd like the rules changed to no PVP in Adventure mode, but whatever... I'll get murdered a couple of times for my acid and the sociopath get his trophy kill. Just be prepared and make sure no matter what you don't leave anything but the minimum for the challenger.  
---
Unless you get a near empty server workshops will result in:
---
1. Getting murdered
---
2. Maybe getting enough resources for whatever you need, depends on how many Survival rejects are on server to murder you at the workshop.
---
3. A growing list of player tags to block the next time you change servers.
---
When player vending goes live, I'll just buy my acid there rather than try and loot or use workshops. 
---
I'd argue DDO does this a lot better than ESO.
---
DDO you can literally play entire free if you wanted to and grind your way towards owning content via playing the game.
---
ESO has no way to actually gain content via playing. And like you said; the moment you drop the sub you get slapped with the biggest ingame ransom system ever (the crafting bag) as suddenly you find picking up crafting materials to be a burden on inventory space.
---
While the DLC content is relatively well priced; everything else is not. It's the reason I guess the atom shop prices don't phase me as I'm used to Zenimax as a whole trying to bleed me dry cost wise. But it's still disgusting to pay $20 for any cosmetic that isn't custom animated, a brand new model, etc.
---
Very interesting. I just assumed these places were fictional. Why is there a lighthouse in the middle of land?
---
And so it begins, even though it's not out yet.
---
At least this one got around the auto-deletes.
---
Clever.
---
Just use the veil of secrets, no perception debuff 
---
I feel like there will be some sorta Harry Potter Weasley Family Easter Egg in there somewhere.
---
The ones with -2 perception protect from airborne diseases 
---
The SBQ has pathetic loot. It’s only good for prime plans, and even that’s iffy considering how prime ammo isn’t really worth the effort to grind out and just how broken the SBQ health pool is. It usually takes thousands of rounds per person to kill it if there aren’t a bunch of players with extremely overpowered builds.
---
I cleaned mine out yesterday. Too many useless legendaries. I still have around 600 because I have so much aid but it's mostly nonperishable food and drink, a collection of Nuka cola, and a lot of booze.
---
I think they spawn often in a Prime nuke.
---
This morning on the PS4 someone nuked Prime and I went down there for the queen kill (was successful) and one appeared.
---
Prime nukes often have a wide assortment of enemies.  Much more interesting the Whitespring nukes (I find them boring personally.  Nothing but glowing ones, and they seem to always drop garbage for me).
---
i'd rather pay up to 99$ upfront for a COMPLETE game as long as it didnt have pay to win in it.  I understand game companies gotta make money, but ffs, don't be underhanded about it and dont tie in-game functionalities to the cash shops.  if you're gonna sell gameplay mechanics, you may as well let people pay real money for the "achievements."  man, its gonna be a sad day when video gaming isnt really about playing video games anymore. are we already at that point?
---
You got it pretty well right, just wanted to add that the watoga station vendor isn't of the responder faction afaik. Here's a breakdown of what factions the vendors are and what cap pool they share:
---
It will be when this drops
---
Yeah it's a crater, there's actually two of them there. I built my camp next to the bigger one.
---
maybe try putting up a few 'lost dog' posters with your number? it worked for me last time
---
Is there still an issue of high levels coming and destroying the generators/trolling? 
---
\-Fast travel while sneaking to Treetops.  It's south of Harpers Ferry.
---
\-Sneak north toward the road.  Peek over the cliff and see if it's safe to proceed.  You're looking for the random encounter spawn on the road under the train bridge.  There's another random encounter that spawns about a hundred yards north of there also.
---
\-These two spawns can bring enemies like super mutants, scorched, and even deathclaws, BUT they can also spawn a corpse in a halloween costume that can have plans for the same costume.  Sometimes it's a witch costume or witch hat.  Other times it's a skeleton mask or skeleton costume.
---
\-Crank out these costumes at an armor workbench.
---
\-Sell them to vendors.
---
\-Farm plastic (scrapper perk and guns, or scavenging toys and nuka cola cups with straws)
---
\-Repeat
---
So, did you lose your stuff?
---
Awesome. It's SamwichPringles. I'm online atm
---
I have around 90 bulk gears and springs tons of nuclear material and black titanium my screws are low since I moved my camp away from a junk pile and lots of other items I will never use at one point I had over 500 circuitry and fiber optics now I try not to keep over 100 of each in my stash and I keep at least a 1000 lead just in case plus lots of backup weapons.
---
Lol.  Spoken like someone who's never had to do it before, but ok.
---
People get to high levels these days by consistently grinding the very best ways to get experience, using things like bobble heads, sleep benefits and perk cards for experience boosts. They also play survival as there is a huge experience boost there currently.
---
Quite a few of the level 200+ players you see simply used the experience exploits from the launch days. You could hit level 200 in a few hours.
---
What's your gt? 
---
Awesome, it's SamwichPringles. Let's meet at Vault 76
---
I don't really do teamups/friend requests, but if you see me I'll probably give you something. If we happen to be on the same server, my camp (big red barn with a balcony) is on the steel/iron node just north of Flatwoods. Anyone is welcome to the farm, water, steel collector, and all the workbenches - nothing is locked. If I take a workshop feel free to pop by too - same thing as the camp, I don't lock anything. If you want something, just run and grab it - no PVP needed. 
---
There’s players that do that already 
---
Added. Mine is skywalker3609
---
Okay, that made me LOL
---
Lmfao.
---
Scenario: I travel to whitesprings, run in through the main entrance and everything spawns. Then there is the sound of missile turrets and all of the enemies run out the back of the golf club.  I follow them out to find most of them dead and somebody collecting the legendary items that spawned when I arrived. They then repeat this process with every other player that goes there. This is why I always destroy turret camps there, they only exist to essentially steal kills and items from other players.
---
lol, I only use the T-60 legs and they don't even change
---
I never have an issue
---
&gt; Rather than it being about making the skin, it's more about what actually gets approved as a skin
---
I though that pretty much stated that. Also, do you think regular paint doesn't go through a marketing team? Really?
---
Dont want to be that guy but...
---
You unlock PVP after reaching lvl5
---
Does it matter the lvl of players? Is there a cut off or what? I'm down if not. Lvl 104
---
Most of the time I assume it's the creator themselves. Especially if they hate on the video. Like some reverse psychology shit lol!
---
At least 10% of that would be people REEEEEEing for no reason and 20% would be people advertising their illegitimate gear for real life money, and their YouTube channels.
---
No it won't be.
---
P2W is selling assassins Sentinel armor sets
---
How do they pick up items off the body's without actually hitting the target themselves though?
---
Ah, I finally was able to see the link and that does look like the "Military Intel Officer" uniform that got datamined a while back. Been hoping to get my hands on that one for a while, now.
---
Awesome but you should have crashed some cars in front of whitesprings for realism :)
---
I'll give er a go! Wish me luck 
---
See you at vault 76. Make it 1800, okay?
---
5.56 is pretty easy to craft too.  You'll likely get more ammo in a shorter amount of time just going out and farming up some lead in Lucky Mine than you would waiting for the ammo factory to make it for you.
---
Ooo shiny 
---
Pay for convenience? Sure. Pay to win? How exactly is it pay to win? All it does is add a bit of convenience to the game. Never have I been in a pvp war and gone "ah $h1t, my weapon broke. Guess I lose this war" or "damn, the only weapon my character Carrie's just broke, guess I just have to punch this queen into submission because I'm too famn stupid to carry multiple weapons that can apply to various situations"
---
Aside from that, is it pay to unlock the recipe for the weapon repair kit or straight pay for each repair kit. There is a difference there as well, both in perception and intent.
---
If it's pay to unlock this one thing, I may consider it with the atoms I've earned with challenge hunting. If it's pay for each one individually (which I don't believe will he the case), then I'll just win the better ones by killing the queen over and over like I do today.
---
Alright, cool
---
Pay to win is selling an advantage for real money. This is a direct advantage. You don’t have to farm repair materials, find an appropriate workbench, and repair your gear there, then travel back to where you were before you repaired. You get to save time that someone that didn’t buy these repair kits doesn’t. Pay to win has differing forms, and both your example and these repair kits are another form
---
Can I come and watch? 
---
If your crop gets destroyed scrap it and place it again. I did it when I got my crops destroyed by super mutant attack
---
Feel free to add me, I'm usually on after 9 EST if that works. Utvak315
---
3 power armor chassis, two twenty pound weapons and a bunch of tse weapons(3 weapons in total) and just a lot of scrap
---
You can get thousands by using the old infinite-disarm-trap glitch that people used to use to level up. You need to be on pc and have autohotkey or something but it works.
---
Yep this was right next to the Fissure Site
---
Oh my god mate. That’s amazing. 
---
I believe that is coming in a future update they've said. 
---
I just sell my body usually. On a slow day I just pull the phone out and use that smash'r app to lure mens to my camp, give them a drink with a lil something in it, and just pull a Cardie B 
---
How about an armor paint shop interface where you can design your own armor color designs (red leg, blue arms, gold body, whatever floats your boat) with an armor designer interface in the Atom store.   Fancier stuff (logos, chrome, gold accents, colored lights, etc.) will increase the price of the armor.  Everyone can have a unique look of armor and BSG can get some of that deparately needed Atom $$.
---
I thought MODUS was going to infect my pipboy when I first did the uplink.  Would be neat if occasionally he popped up all creepy smile on the pipboy when I pulled it up.
---
It sells the ability for dumb asses that don't know how to manage their inventories to do ok.
---
Everyone else will just do it free and never notice.
---
The hyperventilation on this is ridiculous.
---
Junk, junk, and more junk.  I don't like trying to repair something but I can't because I'm 3 springs short.  I got in the habit of grabbing everything that isn't nailed down.  Having excavator armor with calibrated shocks is kind of an enabler, I admit.
---
For the past couple of weeks I've been hoarding plans in expectation of player vending too, but now that that's pushed back I might just dump a bunch of them on some random low level players.
---
Tbh i have lots of lead and gunpowder. I'm just lacking in steel constantly. I also have ammosmith maxed out. So that helps. I always feel like I'm behind on ammo though. 
---
Ive built my base in that tower, think it is a tower that loads ore from the nearby mine onto the train cart. Sad to say nothing is inside that tower but a big empty room. You where not the first to find it and there is no treasure. Sorry to spoil your click bait, wild goose chase.
---
I know this thread is old, but I JUST found the bos combat armor chest piece plan at the Top of the World. Don’t know if that helps. I’m STILL looking for the plans/mods for the arms and legs. Been playing since release. 
---
If you think games like this are shallow,  I'm sorry the world is going to disappoint. 
---
I've seen it, but definitely one of the best mobs in the game imo. It's even in an old lobster van lmao 10/10.
---
From the article on the patch notes inside the vault thing, the verbiage reads as if it’s pay per kit, not pay for a recipe. A recipe would be forgivable. Also, is the improved kit a guaranteed drop? Probably not, so they can get you to buy more of the standard ones. Also, will an improved kit last you through the process of launching another nuke? Also probably not. This is a direct exploitation of the player base. Anyone that says otherwise is delusional and in denial. Players asked for repair kits. Bethesda says ‘we listened! We give you repair kits.....for a price’. Sure, you have atoms saved from challenges. How long will those last? Eventually you WILL run out. This is a predatory mechanic plain and simple. 
---
Every moment spent appreciating and being happy is a moment taken away from complaining. It’s a NO FROM ME.
---
So because those players aren’t as hardcore and efficient as you, that makes exploiting them ok? Bullshit. Exploiting anyone is never ok. And that’s exactly what this is. Stop defending this shitty ass shady company. I’m a 20+ year fallout fan, and even I can see through their bullshit on this
---
I wish WV roads were as good as the roads in 76. 
---
Imo, deathclaws deals enough damage but they have low health/DR
---
Sorry.  I'm new.
---
I’m pretty sure my first purchase on GOG was either FO or Creatures, tbh. Was a while ago so don’t know for certain any more. One of those things were I was stupid excited to find that a digital version of it existed for purchase.
---
You act like the government is forcing you to play them. If you don't like it, dont play it. But if you are going to play and are aware of the situation then just quit your bitching.
---
The only friends I need are my 3 rifles.  Instigating The Dragon,  Executioner's Lever Action, and  Furious  Hand-made with 80 clip.

It would only be okay if it was exclusive to lvl35+ characters
---
Chairs should have a range of special options, like slowly drink and eat, take a nap, shoot desperately at the approaching horde of ghouls I was trying to pick up the ammo next to the chair not sit on it oh god I'm going to die.
---
Doesn't this just speak towards poorly educated children &amp; their lack of understanding for the value of money?
---
Nice one, my ultimate goal with the empty server is to control all the workshops at the one time. 
---
The reward is being stuck in that room and having to fast travel out
---
I've seen reports that Cavalier doesn't work as described, and you're routinely one-shot in a full sprint. 
---
Frogger and pacman on my Atari 2600 were the shit. Back then you only had to worry about one joystick and one button and that thing provided me hours and hours of fun.
---
Honestly, only twice have I ever been in a situation where a mobile repair kit would have been handy or useful. So not a guaranteed drop? No worries, I have more than enough scrap to repair to 200% later. Pay per kit? Yeah, I have no need for those. 
---
I do admit that it is an exploitation of a fan base and agree that it directly contradicts what they said pre-release. But consider this. Politicians on both sides of the political spectrum will this shit daily and fuck up our everyday real lives with their bs. Why don't we get this up in arms over that instead of voting either them or just different versions of them into office thereby effecting real change?
---
Same with Bethesda, if we dont like their shit, stop giving them the power of our money and give it to somebody else.
---
On the other side, I'm still failing to see how this could be classified as pay to win and not just pay for convenience...
---
Junk weight down is pretty good. I'm currently trying to collect full sets of weight reduction armor and it's taking forever to find them. Hasn't helped that today the game has had constant crashing and disconnects. Lost a 3* super mutant warlord and all of my junk to that
---
Staggering them.  VATs crits.   
---
Wether you like it or not we stepped into a warning with the scorched...
---
It does for me.  Considering it takes almost no effort lol
---
I played Fallout 3, New Vegas, 4 and 76. I played 4 several times modded, after playing it quite a bit unmoderated. Maybe a total of 500 hours, and 300 spread between 3 and New Vegas. I have 320 on 76. I’m not necessarily a Fallout fan as I don’t know ALL of the lore and haven’t played the games before 3 despite having been given for free, but I remember the entire story of 3, New Vegas and 4. I also know the maps off my heart and a lot of the things you wouldn’t know if you hadn’t put a lot of time into the game. I’m more of an open world/survival fan. I have probably played 1000 hours of Skyrim on Xbox and then another 300-400 on pc with mods, maybe more. Then I also have like 5000 hour spread across various other open world survival titles like Rust, ARK, DayZ, ArmA. I kind of like grinding, collecting. In Skyrim I managed to completely fuck one save because I’d hoarded so much stuff and for some reason throughout all of my playtime, I always collected charcoal...

---
Currently fastest way to find caps is to force players to pvp in adventure mode, once I become wanted if you kill me I lose what the cost of the bounty was and if I kill after you hit me I can get number of caps based on your lvl which can be done early if you got a good build.
---
New Vegas didn't start out as the darling of the Fallout community. 
---
People seem to forget it was riddled with bugs including one where if companions were sent to the casino and could never be retrieved, ruining many saves with tons of hours invested. 
---
I traded the game in 2 weeks after launch due to that, and repurchased it 4-5 months later. It was the only time I've traded in a Fallout game. 
---
People also forget that while New Vegas had some "cool shit" it was arguably the silliest of all the post Fallout 2 Fallout games. 
---
Old World Blues was by far the single most concentrated dose of silly in recent fallout.

You can collect from turret kills.

 *“All the content we ever put out for Fallout 76–all the DLC, all the post-launch stuff–is going to be free. That’s important. And to say, the Atomic shop is cosmetic stuff. To make sure folks understand–look there’s a line. There are people who have crossed it, but we’re going to stay on the right side of it in terms of the things you can spend money on and how this stuff works and what you’re getting for your $60. That you know, when they put out new content or features or whatever, I’m getting that stuff for free. That feels right.”*

*" While you play Fallout 76, you’ll earn a currency called Atoms by completing various gameplay challenges and achievements. This currency can be used to acquire in-game cosmetic customization items for your character, earnable entirely by playing the game. "*

Oh u/PickleBoyPapi you and your crazy threatening antics
---
You on PC? I can farm the caps with you tonight if so, should take a tad under an hour with both of us on survival mode, me killin and you doing vendor runs.
---
Alternatively if you are particularly in need of them for some trade you have set up then I’d be happy to let you barrow some caps. They come pretty easy to me.
---
Give me a couple screws and a length of wire. I’ll hard wire her in
---
Excellent!

Yea the actual mound is cool, they've got some nifty native american artifacts. If you're into chinese buffets, theres this little place called happy garden a little bit north of the town thats the best buffet I've had. Even further north is Wheeling, a smallish city (i think its classified as a city lol) and tbh I don't spend much time there but it has some cool restaurants. Theres a produce market there called jebias that has some more exotic fruits if youre into that, but nothing you wouldnt be able to get in a bigger city. (Probably only exotic to us because nowhere else around here carries the stuff haha) If you follow I-70 east, it'll take you to the Highlands, which is a strip mall with nice chain restaurants and stores. Theres a primanti brothers there, a five guys, jimmy johns, some others, and some stores like books a million and a few others. Just past that is the cherokee outlet, which sells western clothing like cowboy boots and hats, and they also sell swords and knives and some mallninja stuff. Down south there isn't a whole lot I know about, and the further south you go the more rural the place gets. On the ohio side, theres a few small towns with a few half decent diners, and if you follow I-70 West you get to the Ohio Valley Mall, and a strip mall across from it. The mall is pretty close to St. Clairsville, and they have some more restaurants and stuff.

If you use the duper duper perk ( in luck at level 50) you can sometimes craft double amounts of ammo.

I did quit fo76 months ago when my wife and I realized we spent about half of our play time just getting the stuff we need to play the game, and I still never had enough ballistic fiber to repair my armor. Sure, you might never have needed it, but players like my wife and I who aren’t hardcore would need these.
---
I can see how an argument could be made for pay for convenience, but to me pay for convenience is like world of tanks, where you can pay currency to transfer free exp. it doesn’t give you anything aside from that. This would negate the need to gather the materials, as well as repair mid combat if your weapon breaks fighting the SBQ. That’s a distinct advantage that someone without these repair kits doesn’t have, and for me that’s what pushes it into the pay to win realm. 
---
Yes, politicians do this on a daily basis, and people do get up in arms over it. Hell, people are killing each other over politicians doing this stuff. And whether it’s politicians or a game company, it’s shitty either way and no one should be doing it, because it’s shitty

I run only two Endurance Cards regularly and swap out when I need something specific.
---
Fireproof -  is a MUST.  I run it 24/7 great, great, great, card.
---
Sun Kissed -  It's great (unless you have a decontamination shower) as you don't have to worry about rad-away most of the time except in nuke events. Most of the time you can hold out until the sun comes up to get rid of rads (Use a Rad-Away if you can't).  I've been stockpiling rad-aways for nuke events since I hardly use them anywhere else. I Plan on selling my excess Rad-Away and Stimpacks as nuke events aren't as common as they used to be and I'm looting rad-away and stimpacks faster than I'm using them.

It's an amazing stress reliever sometimes to just obliterate something. This game is fun but when you have to rebuild your house for the 69th time due to weird glitches, sometimes you just want to take it out on the next camp that is just begging to get smashed. I know I'll get downvotes... but hey I'm honest and I balance it out by giving plans, stims, and anything extra I have on me. The only thing I dont break is the decontamination shower btw, I have a heart...
---
Didn't know this. I'll have to unlock that. Thanks!
---
I do t think he had his masks with him.
---
I've found them quite a few times. I know the responder bot in harpers ferry carrys it and also Sutton Station.
---
The community here has made some amazing suggestions for cosmetic items that would have been welcome in the Atom shop but that has all gone ignored by Beth so far. I’m not surprised Beth is resorting to using consumables as a quick money grab. Why put actual work into some really cool camp items or outfits when you can make 2 graphics for 2 types of repair kits, slap it in the shop and pray for thousands of micro transactions? 
---
The offerings in the Atom shop are a fraction of what I was expecting. If they put more work into adding some fresh, un-recycled content, they’ed have at least $20 - $30 from me by now. So far I have spent exactly nada. 
---
The only thing we can do is make it known that we won’t tolerate this slow decline into PTW and vote with our dollars. 
---
I may have plans on one of my characters if you need them. My psn is kit_cloud.
---
Steel is the easiest material to get though.  You can go anywhere with scorched or super mutants, have the Scrapper perk, and get 10-20 steel per weapon they drop.
---
No prob  hope you got it fixed
---
That is really cool of you, thanks.
---
Strange. Fun fact about computers and game settings - setting everything to low does not always help. If you have a decent graphics card but low end processor and set everything to low, your performance might suck. This is because if you set all the settings to low, you’re putting more of the work load on your processor. Medium graphics settings and turning off things like shadows often work better than just dropping every to low.
---
Your system should easily run 76 though. It is still heavily unoptimised, but it should still be playable for you. Check for driver updates, make sure any other unnecessary programs are not running and possibly disable or uninstall security software. Norton for example can use up a lot of resources. At least while you’re playing games, Windows Defender is perfectly capable of keeping your computer safe. Also make sure your hard drive isn’t full, if it only has a fe web left or something, you’re going to notice it.

The fat man wasn’t 1000. It works matches my prototype Ultracite with the chrome and yellow so I got it and the chrome minigun since I use heave Weapons. I do want to see more variety so I do agree.
---
I completely agree it was filled with bugs at launch as most games are but most games get better with age and patches along with player feedback. I agree with silly what you could find and even dialogue was funny sometimes.
---
I thought of runescape’s Barrows XD
---
I need more railway spikes to pin the posters :P
---
This was too real for me.
---
You can get in there, AND you can place your camp there. ;)
---
It could also cause issues with super duper perk.
---
I will take it
---
In open world games like this, it’s all about the processor. The graphics card is important for making things look good, but the processor is what draws shadows and renders the world. When you turn suddenly, the processor draws everything that is being brought into view. When an explosion happens, the processor is handling that. Bullet impacts, picking up or crafting large amounts of items, lots of players in one area (SBQ fight), etc. SBQ fight is especially tough on the processor because there’s probably upwards of 8 players all firing weapons, enemies all around hitting other players and you, getting shot, dying, etc.
---
Ok stupid question cause I refuse to PvP until they fix it. But when you spawn in, if you aren’t holding your weapon, isn’t there a timed invulnerability? Isn’t that what they patched this week ?
---
Why do you hang around if you dislike it so much? You a masochist?
---
Thanks :)

I have seen the Deep Pocketed Leather plans spawn near the Armor Bench in Flatwoods, on that desk there.  It's random, but not exceedingly rare.
---
They are much rarer now since the big vendor change back in Patch 5.  Many of these rare plans that we used to hop for at various vendors just don't show up ever now that the vendor inventories are more or less "fixed".
---
Seems the vendor patch exposed a weakness of the plan system.  Plan spawns are not well thought out over the whole of Appalachia.  There seems to be little to no rhyme or reason as to where the plans spawn.  Nothing is sectioned out by level or theme, etc.  So prior to the Vendor change, many of these things came from server hopping vendors.  Now that the vendors are not the primary source, we have to rely on the plans appearing in the wild and are discovering it doesn't happen often.
---
Yup, find'em fairly regularly. 
---
Man I cant even go in the chimney thingys I just start dying even on pa
---
Have the forest,dune,Patriot,and vault for x01. Dune(tan) looks great, but not many dunes in 76
