Thanks for that! Found the other subreddit too. 
---

---
Was about to go home and sell those plans for like 1k a piece. SUPER Glad I asked first now lol
---
---
---
Nope, in fact I play everyday on XB and have only had a few disconnects in the whole time since launch. It's super rare for me at least. Just got off a 4 hour bender and it was smooth as butter.
---
Perfect! Need anyone on Xbox to join, I'm happy to help!
---
Genuine question.... people still play this after all that’s happened.... and NOT happened?
---
When in NW lobby you can look up challenges to find out how much more you need. In total you need 14k.
---
Does it work well?
---

Awesome what kind is it?
---
I am theShaman_No_ID
---
It's funny. My main is in the Mid 280's at the moment, and my greatest joy in the game is playing "provider"/"crafting assistant"/ Host / Protector for friends and strangers. I really enjoy that a lot.   
---
BUT:  
---
When I started out another alt a few weeks back, I didn't even arrange to drop MYSELF any stuff. I just made it all myself and mostly ran solo. The early game really isn't that hard... Once I got to the Tweens and that Mid-level blues point, I did a few transfers, but mostly I enjoyed relying on my own means. 
---
Maybe I'm just confused. :) #funbothways?
---
Nice!
---
[removed]
---
Awesome!
---
"How much would you pay for it?"
---
How does one recipe allow you to sell across multiple characters?
---
Finally, some happy news in this sub! Congratulations to you and your husband!
---
Cool ))
---
If ya don't miss with the BP pistol even super mutants die in one hit with a bloodied one. The Revolutionary Sword isn't that great though. A meathook would be a good play
---
I make them on one character and transfer them to my alts to sell too
---
Drifter outfit is common and explorer is rare?
---
I don't play this mode.. are there any furniture item rewards or is it all skins?
---
It could be that they really don't know what we have in our stash. At least that was their reasoning as to why they had problems with returning scrap when it got deleted. Idk if that is still an issue.
---
Will they find something else to make controversial? Can pretty much guarantee that. Will wastelanders be free? Yes. Will there be wastelanders related cosmetics in the atomic shop? Obviously. Will There Be fallout 1st exclusive outfits and skins? Definitely. Will wastelanders be free? As I said 6 sentences ago, yes.
---
It's a 2 star explosive, ghoul-slayer (30% extra damage to ghouls) black powder rifle
---
Thank you for the responses thus far. To explain a little deeper, since my fiance and I game together. We decided to upgrade our standard CenturyLink service and purchased the 30mbps service and had new service installed in the house. Brand new router, upgraded from one that was over 10 years old. And since she logged in it's been constant (server not responding and then disconnecting).
---
When you have been a member for a month.
---
All i was asking for was some proof of this. Something more than just "Bethesda said so." Because their track record at this point isnt very good.
---
"'...And he'll want want to use your yacht.' And I don't want this thing smelling like fish."
---
That's great to know! I was worried about the exact events you mentioned, especially the queen, but since it sounds viable, I may have to finally give this build a shot!
---
Yeah that's fair enough. It'll definitely sell
---
My up-close choices are a furious automatic quad 45 combat rife for large enemies or a 3-star gamma gun for others.  
---
I don’t remember which perks it has but that gamma gun is seriously OP, even against enemies who you would think should be healed by radiation.
---
Gin. Please, just give me gin.
---
That isn't how a minigun fires.  Try not to throw out IRL comparisons without actually knowing how the IRL variant works, m'kay?
---
Oh that's wonderful!  Congratulations!
---
That’s going to be all he proof there is. The fact they repeatedly hve said in official statements that it is their largest completely free expansion to date is the evidence. Believe it or don’t, it doesn’t matter. It will be free.
---
I would be in, 100%
---
I’m relatively new to the game and run a .50 cal myself. I’m nowhere near that much damage. Can I ask how you’ve gotten it so high? Are you bloodied? I’m full health and I think I’m at 120 damage.
---
Why is that?
---
Awesome thanks
---
Sweet
---
The Desert Rangers wore that same outfit and date back to the modern-day Texas Rangers.
---
At this point, if the only proof that exists is "Bethesda said so". Im not holding my breath.
---
I’ll check the perks tonight and post back
---
I love the game, and even though there are mutants and deathclaws and ghouls, it shows that in the darkest places love can spring up.  Congrats
---
This makes me so happy for your experience and at the same time depressed that I will never be so lucky. Lol.
---
Congrats!!!
---
Well these are official statements vs a tweet taken out of context and an cryptic interview where they talk around the issue.
---
Laser gun skins to ultracite lasers as well.
---
Congrats! I'm super happy for you guys!!
---
Good use for that overzealous melee guy we all know and love... 
---
Oh, you want to be closer to SBQ?  Hope you have fall resist!
---
I did the entire event. If memory serves, the pumpkin combat armor skin was available at 7k points, and the glowing skeleton at 14k.
---
On XB1 I go into the map screen and hit the right D-pad to bring up the challenges.
---
Check your personal challenges while in the NW lobby. It'll show yournprogress towards all of the rewards.
---
Congrats! Hopefully he's not a raider or a supermutant!
---
Back mounted power armor mod...
---
Just close your eyes and let that sentence flow through you.
---
What outfit?
---
10mm pistol, assault rifle, combat rifle, pumpkin combat armor paint, and a glow in the dark skeleton outfit.
---
4 skins, and an outfit.
---
Bethesda is realizing they don't need to respond to the peasants on reddit because everyone that actually plays the game is a fallout first subscripters?
---
Other rewards like skins, C.A.M.P. Items and icons are tied to your NW player level.
---
People are gonna disagree but it should be like the vault armors if they introduce this
---
He's pretty awesome. Haven't seen him on as a CM in many months but liked his work back when he was just a Youtuber.
---
Curious to see if anyone asks him any hard questions about CMs and Bethesda and more importantly, if he responds.
---
I envisioned it more like this:
---
You tether SBQ to the ground.  West Virginia is then ripped out of the earth and SBQ flies us all to Canada.  Game Over.
---
You'll be alright 😘
---
That's super awesome. Congrats!!!
---
Good luck! Keep finishing in the top 10, you'll know it out in no time.
---
Um...That's like saying you losing your mom isn't any more important than anyone else's loss.
---
As if such a thing wasn't even important to you.  That's pretty cold.
---
I'm sure losing your *child* would be far more important to the parents of that child than anyone else's death to them.
---
The shit I see on this subreddit...
---
Launching Legendary along side a week of double Exp NOT put behind a paywall, would be a brilliant idea. People would be racing for as many legendary resets as they could get in the week, and that would skyrocket the player number, and playtime, so PR, and sales wise, it would look really good for them.
---
Yeah until we get the scenario where they say they couldnt get the game altering dialogue stuff to save to your character so they have to put it in private servers. 
---
Like i said several times. I just dont have faith in the company when they say they are going to do something anymore. Which is unarguably, something they deserve. Im hesitant. Im not out here saying screw bethesda and all the bullshit they do. Im willing to wait it out and see, i was just hoping to come across some more definative proof before im willing to get excited again. At this point, the proof isnt there for me. So ill just keep on waiting. 
---
Theres no argument here. Theres no ill will, im just explaining where im at as a customer.
---
Or we could simplify it more:
---
Bolo mod for the ol' 'Poon Gun.  
---
That could be seriously offensive if one has no sense of humor...
---
For how much money?
---
Hierarchy?
---
Spare me! The people who love this game understand that the people developing it don't work for free so we are happy to pitch in to make sure fallout 76 keeps moving forward. I love this game!
---
There is a chain of command
---
Yeah...that would be best. It's probably how other games do it...have a skeleton crew of devs around to make sure the event launches correctly and there's no major bugs.
---
Because there are people who don't celebrate the holidays or people who celebrate one holiday but not another. There has to be people who can work on the holidays.
---
I had my suspicions when he’d glow and come chase me when I’d start playing music, but he turned out pretty alright! ;)
---
Make sure to join an adventure mode server before playing Nuclear Winter. You only have to do this once every time you launch the game. For some reason, NW causes some challenges to complete without giving you the rewards.
---
Why would it increase? The price plummeted a long time ago. Any low-level players you see are most likely 2nd or 3rd characters.
---
&gt; When someone enter a power armor then mutations and some player's perks should be disabled.
---
I like this.
---
Not even just this, some of the comments sound like people who have never lost anyone and are just jumping on the bullshit wagon to bullshit because of the sub we're in.
---
It's pretty fucked.
---
I'm really not up for that at all. That's not right.
---
Ah yes, and some additional xp slapped on it as well
---
5500 now thanks!
---
I ran a stealth build for a long time. At big events, or teamed up, it's next to impossible to maintain stealth. You'll just be plinking away at the SBQ, but you can still do significant dmg at other events.
---
I gave it up for a more utilitarian bloodied rifleman/commando build.
---
What sorta build are you picking to run? I personally run a stealth-crit-commando build, and it's so much fun! I like having crits to fall back on when stealth fails, when you still need to do a lotta DMG at once.
---
We wish you the best as well, guy. Hope to see you back one day, so we can possibly fellowship together.
---
Well that was a year ago. Maybe it's time to give them a little more money. The people developing the game have to be paid. There's nothing to open my eyes to other than this is how businesses work. They make products for money to pay their employees.
---
Probably has something to do with social and gaming being down for the last 3 days.
---
You're delusional. That's not the issue (charging for private servers) so stop trying to glaze over the true issues.
---
TSE is relatively weak and has horrible accuracy drawbacks for a sniper. A sniper is perfect for a bloody build, or an instigating long gun if you prefer high health.  Faster fire rate, +10% aim damage and 50% VATS crit are great alternatives to explosive.  Explosive is one of the worst effects for an instigating weapon, because the splash damage will destroy the primary effect in a mob situation. +10% aim damage is fantastic for an instigating scoped sniper rifle.
---
Oh, that makes more sense. If you are refering to that guy, we were both server hopping on our own I guess because we joined 3 different servers (not consecutively.)
---
This post is trash but trash treating people like trash isn't trash?
---
What a painful day it will be for you when you finally see your reflection for who you really are.
---
For halloween - it's all skins.
---
There are some other items that you can get though for regular rewards.  You can get different models of stash boxes (there's a nice tiny one that I like). You can also get an overseer chair and some statues
---
Being able to craft your own legendary was one of my favorite parts of Guild Wars 2. It took months of questing, grinding, exploring and achieving, but it was worth it!
---
Yea but I'd say at least 80% of the people making noise about fallout 1st aren't actually customers so it's not really feed back. More like bullying via youtubers.
---
On PS4 I see a lot of high levels, a good amount of low levels, and a ton of low level players. I also almost never run into the same people. It's always fun having a lot of low levels though because I enjoy helping them out
---
You really are naive.
---
I'm okay with fishing and gold panning. Both make sense and arent a stretch. I mean we have fishing poles in the game. So the groundwork is set. 
---
Maybe one day. *fingers crossed*
---
"We are aware of this problem and are investigating it."
---
&gt;Um...That's like saying you losing your mom isn't any more important than anyone else's loss.
---
Correct, it isn't any more important than anyone else's loss.
---
It is more important to ME obviously, and that's why I put a bust in my camp for her instead of for anyone else's loss. If it were my video game I sure would put something more than a bust to remember her by or dedicate something to her. 
---
I wouldn't ever think to ask Bethesda to do that for me though. Thousands of people play this game and all those players have probably lost a close human or animal, beth isnt going to put thousands of gravestones in the game dedicated to each fans lost loved ones though.
---
They don't need to "pretend" that "outrage" dind't "happen".
---
Idiots got excited.  Why should Bethesda respond?
---
I definitely struggle with depression. I find anything that focuses my mind can help shield against, like, mental illness thoughts, and video games definitely count
---
Thanks. I saw a few people in the glowy skeleton outfit and knew it must be a NW thing.
---
Yeah, ok. Let's start with two. What's your gamer tag?
---
I wish AWOL Armaments was added to the list -- that's a fun and rewarding event.
---
If starfield and TES6 is a clown fiesta like Fo76, wait for it.  
---
And no i am not talking about the bugs, we know they are coming, i am talking about microtransactions and other bullcrap they may deliver with future games.
---
Also helps with chronic illnesses and pain.  Good post!
---
That chair is thee shit. Had I the patience for that mode I would have the VTU stuff and that damned chair. Thanks for the info.
---
In loving of memory of Sprite Cranberry. Till our dying days, we shall all ask ourselves at the Christmas season, “Do you wanna Sprite Cranberry?”

Thanks for the tips on checking challenges! Totally spaced that... As a side note I'm literally just hiding in this mode and then playing Outer Worlds on a different screen lol
---
The only "wrong comment" they are not allowed to make:
---
"What the fuck is *wrong* with you morons?"
---
Trade you pumpkin shorts for a new chef knife and 2 tickets to a NoFx show.  Hahah.  Anything in game to trade?  Looking for a rifle with furious perk added.
---
You say that you see things? Or rather that this entity shows you things? I must ask this but have you been around any sort of radiation?
---
The comments on this post have killed all my faith in this community.
---
Your child deserves better than to be memorialized in this dumpster fire game or her memory desecrated by the raging wildfire that is this community.
---
All it'd take is one additional texture on a gravestone.  That's just asking for too much of the jealous fans that want to be the one's to have their name there instead.  But Bethesda steals your money with lies and bullshit, you all can't eat enough of that bullshit.
---
By God, just go OP.  There's nothing here for you except envy and disdain for your deceased child in this septic tank of a sub.
---
Video games are a beautiful thing for bringing people together.
---
15+ kills in a round is probably an aimbot or at least a recoil elimination hack. (unless they dropped a Morgantown nuke early and caught more than one squad in the blast).
---
That said, one-shotting someone with head-shots from the cliffs or other high points is NOT impossible. (and is my main strategy, when I get the choice)  
---
With these perks - Master Rifleman+Long Shot+Tank Killer+Bloody Mess &amp; either the Scoped Lever Action or the Scoped Hunting Rifle, a solid headshot will down most characters from sneak, even at the limits of the render distance (which, despite the #s indicated under the weapon stats, is usually just over 100 meters).    
---
The Combat Sniper is less effective/accurate at those extreme distances, but a bit easier to follow up with closer in. Damage drops off the farther out you go, although long shot mitigates this a bit. 
---
I'm not ever killing 15 players/round. My best round ever was 9, and that included one nuke drop and a few up close submachinegun kills (not to mention quite a lot of missed shots, probably well over 50%). I average closer to 2-3 on a good night. :)
---
They listen but they don't always reply to or enact every suggestion. A good chunk of people leaving feedback don't care about future of the game. They hijack and exacerbate popular genuine public feedback for their own selfish motives. Even if BGS politely and honestly explains why they can't/won't enact a popular suggestion, they'll be hit by a firestorm of fallacious comments by those people.
---
They've implemented an enormous amount of suggestions and fixes. It's a completely different game than it was at release.
---
All hail the masters of the wastelands! 
---
Now GIT EM!!!
---
Lol, that's what I said! Fishing poles are available to pick up for junk. That's what sparked the idea for me. I mean, I get not straying to far away from what Fallout is. I just feel like 76 is more grounded on survival mode since there isn't any NPC's. I get both sides of the argument though.
---
Can someone tell me where we find out when they are? I feel like I always hear about them right after they happen.
---
K. I am a scavenger. I have been a few weeks. I don't have much to give but I give any extra I may have. It isn't for everyone tho. Happy gaming
---
I've been spending more time playing the Final Fantasy VII port, in all honesty. Even being as old of a game as it is, it def has more replay value. I got the free download for 76 when I bought my X 1, and barely play anymore. Paid 12 bucks for the FFVII port, and rather play it.
---
Someone buying their games is not a "true fan" but you have to keep throwing money on a bullshit subscription for them?!  i know you are being sarcastic here but they handle us that way.  
---
I payed full price for Fo76 in order to have 100% of future content for free like they advertised back then, but now i am asked to pay even more to access QoL content that make the game a lot more enjoyable.
---
I guess he took the rocket part of the super sledge literally
---
I’m not big on PVP, I just go in solo (so I don’t mess anyone else up) and hide somewhere no one ever spawns.
---
Still a work in progress. Need to balance out the VATS delay on weapon switching. Probably easier outside of VATS, but my build is still crit/luck/VATS at the moment.
---
I’ve had the same issue and trying to resolve it for a straight year now
---
I'll add you when I get home
---
Let's see, Fallout 76 came out in  November 14, 2018.  Dating for less than a year?  Well I hope it works out for you two.  Good luck in your future.
---
Cool I’ll give it a shot
---
Thanks
---
Clearly the person that wrote that didn't look into what was actually happening, since it was nonbsubbers using a glitch to kill subbers as a retaliation for supporting this shitshow, and not the other way around lol. And people wonder why I hate all forms of news these days, not like journalistic integrity has gone down the drain over that past few years, and I'm starting to rant, but yeah, tldr: dumbass makes bullshit news piece to get attention, and totally flips the script.
---
"you are a bunch of entitled cunts so ~~we've hired a bunch of assassins to kill you all~~ we're just going to ignore you".
---
Would be true if the people complaining were "consumers".
---
Depression is why I bought my first Xbox. Escapism ftw....  :L  There's a reason I get so vocal about the state of the game....it's the place I go to escape the bullshit I deal with all day. I may be willing to play on Xbox with some folks, but I currently have trust issues thanks to the last "friend" I made on 76.
---
Get someone to build you one in your camp. Lvl 10 is not hard ti reach. I also don't like BR nodes,but it is very slowly growing on me.
---
I believe that the legendary survivor that’s on its way helps. Not sure how it will work
---
They can't even be bothered releasing a statement trying to explain their actions. That alone speaks volumes. Their "fixes" which are few and far in between should of never been necessary. The suggestions are shoved behind paywalls. What they are doing is screwing over the community and being backed by people like you who think it is perfectly ok.
---
the   jack o' lantern combat rifle skin from nuclear can't be used on the fixer, even though it IS a combat rifle.
---
I see many, many more lowbies around than I used to.
---
They are not "the same" 
---
The Fixer quite likely has a different descriptor or item_name than a Combat Rifle because of it's semi-legendary "faster sneak speed while aiming" attribute.
---
You can apply all the Combat Rifle mods without any issues, but Atom Shop skins probably need the specific info added to their coding. 
---
Not saying it shouldn't be permitted, but most people don't know (or don't care) that the people that generate "art assets" ARE NOT devs or coders, and once designs are approved, they're probably coded using templates - meaning any item that doesn't conform to the template won't be included. 
---
While it may only be "a 5 minute job" to add Fixer info to the skin template, the task still needs to be approved, prioritized, and scheduled into the overall work flow . . . Not a really high priority since nothing is really broken.
---
What system?
---
Eeyyy there's some good ole automated replies
---
Todd Van Der Linde has a plan... He just needs money. Money from your kind from robbery.
---
It just works.
---
Exactly my point. So many people on here being themselves true fans only because they continuously take but this is bull crap and subscribed to "support the developers."  My $60 plus atoms has been enough to expect a good game with trustworthy developers.
---
I have never used VATS, and the multi Black Powder Pistol deal works very well. If you have Gun Runner you can just run away from most things while shooting at them. 
---
 Great fun and surprisingly effective.
---
Omg, I don't know what's more sad, the person who posted this or the people in article.
---
It reads like an Onion piece.
---
My wife and I met on Killzone (PS2) long ago in 2004, Been happily married since 2013. Glad you found the love of your life.
---
Drifter is common and Explorer is uncommon.
---
Let's see, pretentious comment? Well I hope it works out for you. Good luck in your future.
---
Don't worry, it just works
---
I'm up for helping but not if others are telling us what to do.
---
PC. Fallout 76 being in the steam launcher and Fallout on steam.
---
I have 3 different solid builds on my channel, you can check and decide if you like one of those https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLh2qduKezasfLpzgYQgQ7fk5VyJkLDyIZ
---
Should put a tribute to their love in the game.
---
I don't know a single person (PC) that has then .. CAN you build the rewards in others camps? Oh ohhhh can you or someone else tell me if you can build the damned egg rewards from the Easter thing in others camps?.. I missed the egg and need that chair!
---
If Bethesda does this, I will probably forgive them for most of the crap they've done recently.
---
Zax hates your fallout 1st
---
Is that mainly how nonpvps should go about this? Find somewhere to hind and move when the circle gets smaller?
---
Oh no. I haven't been told to do anything. I chose to be a scavenger cause I have first so I can get extra scrap easy.
---
&gt; It's getting smaller hopefully
---
Twat.
---
[This website](https://nukacrypt.com/search) allows you to search weapons and play around with mods to see what does what. Just click on “advanced search,” limit the search to weapons and type a name in.
---
Dont give them anymore ideas! They'll just charge them back to us...
---
It wouldn't make me come back. All the way up to the Halloween event I was playing regularly, then the event had me disconnect, and lag, and they put special rewards behind Nuclear Winter which I don't play because I spend more time finding a game than in the actual game...
---
I dunno. I'll come back for Wastelanders to have a look. Otherwise they're lost my interest. My character is level 120-something, triple XP doesn't matter at this point.
---
What do reddit posts have to do with the game?
---
I walked away by accident by playing something else and realized I wasn't actually even having fun playing Fallout, but didn't realize it.
---
I knew my wife for 3 months before we got married lol
---
Seriously tho. Idk why everyons trying to give them more free content they can just sell back to us. Nice to see im not the only one that feels this way. Seeing everyone giving them more ideas out right makes me feel like the crazy one.
---
...I'm crazy arent I? :c
---
No, double xp weekends don't inventivize player retention, they speed up the new character grind. What would actually retain players is giving us actual fucking content, and not making decisions based on their profit margin alone
---
&gt; I love French wine, like I the French language. I have sampled every language, French is my favorite. Fantastic language. Especially to curse with. Nom de dieu de putain de bordel de merde de saloperie de connard d'enculé de ta mère. It's like wiping your arse with silk. I love it.
---
Well written brother! 
---
I’ll put up the same offer on XB1. GT: smtpdlr
---
See what I mean, you got downvoted for asking to trade lol.
---
B2525 handmade is one of the most sought after weapons in the game.  In my experience  with trading  - "less ap cost" as 3rd star one several weapons types such as handmades and fixers  has most market value.
---
Yep. Anything they say regarding this shitstorm would make things even worse. They apologise? Outragers won't accept it. They promise to never do that again? Outragers won't believe it (to be honest, neither would I) and will demand more. They take F1st down? Outragers would still rage Bethesda not listening anyway. Silence is the best way, because this way we only have these occasional "they are silent" threads.
---
Just look at the Blizzard ban fiasco. The president of Blizzard apologised twice - for the second time even on Blizzcon where he even didn't have to do it. But those fanning the flames didn't accept it - "Nope, this isn't the apology I wanted. It has more sentences than the one I wanted. Here, have my feces!"
---
Man, this is really great.
---
Translation for monobrow monolinguals -
---
MDR == Morte de rire == Died laughing == LoL.
---
Probably the one good thing about not having crossplay.
---
That's almost exactly the type of build I was leaning towards. Any tips? Must have perks? Stuff like that?
---
Well if you look past literally anything other then the m134 which is the most common one people think of. You would know that there is indeed some that do it. It depends on make and model of the minigun. Some will have a "spin up" button but typically this isn't common because most assume that if you want to use it you'll fire it. Such as the MXU-470/A that were typically found on AC-47's and would be used based on this system. They had the spin up button because whenever you're already so far in the air having it ready to fire immediately really helps versus a order to fire then a 3 second spin up. So try not to just assume there isn't anything like that without knowing, m'kay?
---
only if youre a boomer
---
I wish it did. Would've been gotten way more attention amd been taken care of by now
---
Pics or it isn't real
---
I just need a half price scrip weekend so i can buy more stalkers pipes 👌
---
Okay cool! Just didn't like word, good communities with folks bringing their own thing to the table is healthy! I'm a crafter, so I scavenge a lot too. It's a great game to loose yourself in the environments too!
---
Yep. Can confirm I got my 500 atom refund.
---
So uh off-topic but does anybody know if either of the Super Sledge skins color the Concrete head on the All Rise?
---
It read like an onion piece? Maybe it's hard to believe but a lot of people who play fallout 76 are fallout 1st subscribers. We obviously could give a damn what others think of that however I am annoyed by the fact that the games subreddit is filled with toxic trolls who can't get over the fact that this game isn't going anywhere and that it has plenty of people who are willing to pitch in to make sure it succeeds. There are people making post about conspiracy theories about how we are all just employees of Bethesdas PR department. I mean how delusional will the haters become in trying to tell themselves that everyone agrees with them and that the game sucks so no one wants to pay extra for a subscription? The way I look at it is I am paying for the longevity of this game and features I get with the subscription are just a bonus. Let's be real though because the private servers are actually pretty dope as is and only will become better as time goes on.
---
Thisexact logic is why i don't rarely play this game.
---
If every couple of months the advice is to not play ther game and come back later then there is something seriously flawed with the game
---
Wow, amazing, congratulations!
---
Same here. Keeping focused keeps the anxiety away for me! Panic fucking sucks.

Fallout failure has become somewhat of a urban legend that has no basis in reality. Fallout 76 failed just like theirs big foots and unicorns walking in the forest.
---
Where do I join this group?
---
Bethesda and Xenimax will see this post and go "Hmm... our community wants a double xp weekend?" 700 atoms for a hour xp boost.
---
&gt; Merrrrde.... Imbecile!."
---
Shit, you idiot.
---
&gt; Nique ta mère!!!!!
---
(Fuck your mother)
---
&gt; "YOU bloody branleur"
---
You bloody wanker (ouankeur).

&gt; Go hommm tu yur mama and suck her dick you piece of shI-It...
---
Untranslatable.
---
(Graffiti seen in France:  "Nique la police"... "mais ils sont moche, j'ai pas envie")
---
Because Pete is a lying piece of shit. The atom shop made Bethesda tons of money, Bethesda is a billion dollar company not an indie game you dunce
---
ppl r upset over delay of wastelanders &amp; fallout 1st. theyve been announcing their decisions to leave the game or even boycott bethesda on this very reddit. going by the number of these posts, i dont imagine the playerbase is getting any bigger.
---
We hope it does, too! We’ve both gone through a pretty traumatic relationship, so we’ve had many long talks about our life goals, intentions, and needs in a relationship. So far it’s worked well for us, and we’re extremely blessed to have each other.
---
True but a simple query should be able to determine amounts of certain items. This is what they did before so they do have the tools to do this.
---
My Instagram account is mothermaxim! Our history together is all on there! :)
---
Keep imagining.
---
Reddit != real world.
---
This sub is worthless for players definitely move on
---
Same here! Video games have helped me through depression and drug addiction.  Sending positive vibes to you, be safe!
---
Just do the challenges.  No need to over think.
---
Maybe but as a former player it wouldn't be enough for me
---
ONLY people saying this are those that want to stir the drama pot... literally the overwhelming and greater majority doesn’t care what people think if they buy something with their own money...
---
Started playing during the 2x xp event a couple months back and it felt so slow because well, i don't have a good build, and i have no idea what i'm doing. Never played a fallout before. 
---
Seeing all these posts about "it won't effect me because i'm 250+" is just depressing. Maybe everything doesn't have to be about you, Susan.
---
Game is in turmoil and my dude is making request for fking cranberry nuka cola
---
Wow, this comment reads like an Onion piece.
---
Yeah, about 20% according to a recent poll are and about 1/2 of that are long term subs.
---
You know you talk of toxic trolls and sound pretty toxic doing so, right?
---
&gt; this game isn't going anywhere and that it has plenty of people who are willing to pitch in to make sure it succeeds 
---
Since this post isn't going to go anywhere and I'd be surprised if it lasts much longer if my read on the mods here are right but let's have a serious discussion on the matter.
---
Why support a game and company that you admit yourself isn't going anywhere? Do you feel, given how this game was launched and how Bethesda has been throughout are worthy of support? Why is it incumbent on people like you to keep the game afloat?
---
What evidence is there that the "haters" are delusional? Could perhaps the same logic of delusion be applied to those that keep wanting to spend money on this game?
---
Not looking to hate on you at all. Genuinely curious to see how rational and thought out your perspective is.
---
That would be incredible, good suggestion
---
Fat stacks
---
Should totally just release it and include some lore saying it never came out because it didn’t test well, make it a joke about how Sprite Cranberry got canned after one year bc of shit sales
---
Nice try, Todd Howard.
---
It's not in turmoil. It's in controversy. It's v important to make distinctions, it's similar to hype
---
The eggs i don't think so,but my friend totally placed the chair and a stash box from NW in my camp ,back when i had yet to play it.  
---
You can always ask somebody in game and give them a beer.
---
This post proudly sponsored by Bethesda.

Since the last update I'm seeing blooms almost every time I swing by Dyer Chem.
---
aka honhonhon
---
shrinking massively, i have 60 friends and i never see more than four or fight anymore and it’s always the same one
---
I think that it would be cranberries for simplicity's sake. Though it actually would be Fallout humor for it to require other stuff instead. Hell Nukashine even has nuclear waste in it
---
That's so lovely. All the best for a terrific wedding and a long and happy marriage!
---
Maybe instead of xp how about atoms. Maybe 10 atoms for each level one day a month. Or maybe a kill scorch/gouls/water critters on day and get an atom for each one killed.
---
It's not that they can't be bothered to explain their actions. It's that they won't benefit from explaining they're actions. Like I said already, anything they say will be distorted by people with their own selfish motives. Any public statement they make is a statement to their fans and enemies. 
---
&gt;What they are doing is screwing over the community and being backed by people like you who think it is perfectly ok. 
---
I don't agree with everything they've done but I think leaving inflammatory comments will only create a bigger disconnect between "the community" and BGS.
---
I'm sure you 1st subs will have the opportunity to buy one, considering Bethesda is moving heavily towards the P2W model. 
---
Their words, not mine.
---
I agree. Also a place on the map always ‘red zone’ for a nuke. Tons of enemies.
---
Confirmed! I was just kidding btw
---
So what would you have us do if we can't comment or say anything about what they do?
---
I know! I just wanted someone to see how handsome my fiancee is! ❤️
---
Two weeks seems like a pretty long time to maintain a rage boner for a game that has been out for a year. Are you suffering from priapism?
---
Such luck!! Congrats in your find and your soon to be Husband, I wish you both well and hope to see you in Appalachia
---
If you can't tell the difference between calculating a dollar amount when given a percent raise and calculating the probability of something dropping in a video game you have no right to bitch about people not understanding probabilities. There is no 'chance' associated with any example you gave. 
---
We aren't talking about percentages at all. We're talking about **probability**.
---
Get off your fucking soapbox if you can't even bitch about the correct problem with modern society.

Hi! Your post has automatically been removed because your post's title appears to be in breach of rule 6:

Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/fo76) if you have any questions or concerns.*
---
So is this why I sometimes just randomly find like 30 mines pilled around?
---
Thank you so much
---
Very sweet! Congratulations!
---
i think maybe not constantly doing shady business practices and pissing off the community might help a little more. if there is a double xp weekend, it would be for fo1st members only.
---
Sorry I'll check again on my computer tonight.
---
They weren't armed.
---
*waiting for a snarky  Fallout 1st comment*
---
Congrats,  btw
---
Sign up for Fallout second, and for 40 bucks a month we will reduce cheat bots by 10 per month. But only from pay servers.
---
I mean, that's great and I'm happy for you. Fallout 76 has not been out for a calendar year. Personally I see a ton of red flags with that.
---
I think videogames and all hobbies exist because of that, and have the same effect on all of us: they keep our heads busy. Sometimes, all I wanna do is to play for a couple of hours, like, I am not in the mood for anything else but that. 
---
I roleplay the game, add me if you have an army helmet and army fatigues. Soldiers only!
---
Dude thanks so much! This is super helpful!
---
There likely is a more efficient way, I do kill the occasional animal or other monsters. It’s slow going but it’s fine for me
---
If they ignore it, then maybe you'll go Fallout First.
---
This made me tear up... congrats you two
---
I'm not sure, I have 1st but I don't feel different by other players... I feel old because I have more then 1600 hours of playing, I think this can make a real difference 😂
---
However, if this is true, is so sad
---
congratulations, hope no scorchbeasts attack!
---
I really wish people would understand that not everyone has time to play on the weekend. I have far more free time during the week.
---
Weightless armor with Berserk and chameleon mutation would've been an interesting combo.
---
You just need to learn the layout of the pipes.  30s is plenty of time given the amount of time you gain from each pipe you break.
---
Nice! Congrats on the happy life to come!
---
ownership doesn't matter if you're inside the circle when he initiates. As long as anyone is in the circle that isnt in your party you cannot capture a workshop. therefore to prevent people from camping the circle permenantly invulnerable you are allowed to attack and kill them without their consent. this is why I hate the pvp in this game. just understanding the aggro rules requires a law degree.
---
agreed.
---
&gt;There's a reason I get so vocal about the state of the game....it's the place I go to escape the bullshit I deal with all day.
---
I think this is true for a lot of struggling people. 10-15+ years ago gaming was a fairly pure escapism option. But now that monetization and cutting corners has become so prevalent, it feels like a personal attack for many people. We often see people saying "calm down man it's just a game," but these games are often more real than reality for some people.
---
Congrats! I wish you happiness!
---
I don’t really believe they would start posting recipes, but then again I also never thought they would actually paywall the game behind an over priced subscription service. It actually wouldn’t be so bad if they had focused on stabilizing the game first before having the balls to do a shitty cash grab.
---
Although I definitely could see them posting exclusive content for Fo1st subs and THEN charging for it just a little over the subscribers 1650 monthly allotment of Atoms.
---
but that would hurt the plans for XP increasing Atom Shop items.
---
Lead, nuclear material, and steel are a few
---
I don't even see the point of the fridge, but running a high luck build on both chars with salt. I could see maybe use it to store food while you're letting food spoil on your char for lots of fert. But you do it the other way around, store the crops you want to spoil in the stash and it's better. If it was 90% or like you're saying worked on the entire stash for vending, be worth having.
---
Stimpacks I carry 20 and keep 100 in storage and vendor combined.
---
Diluted Rad-X I carry 10 and keep 50 in storage.
---
Rad-X I keep 25 in vendor and sell the rest to bots.
---
RadAway I carry 10 and keep 75 in storage and vendor combined.
---
I don’t do diluted RadAway or diluted Stimpacks or Super Stimpacks.
---
Buffout, Bufftats, and Psychotats (I think) I use to increase carry weight. I keep 5 on me and 10 of each in storage.
---
Red Ant Larger (+50 carry weight) I’ll craft whenever I can get ant meat. I usually have 2 on me and 5 in the vendor at 25c each.
---
Most of the other drugs I don’t use.
---
Nuclear family ❤️💥
---
Do the Wasted On Nukashine questline by "reading" the Frat Party poster in any railroad station (or CAMP).
---
Completing that will unlock the Crafting station and the Fermentor, along with the repeatable Daily Biv quests, which can provide beverage samples and the recipes to craft them.
---
So I was a lvl25 or so and my new found friend (lvl19) says go out and hit "x" to befriend it. I say "That sounds lije something a troll says". I try, I die. I proced to call him a liar and refuse to belive anything esle he says. Then on my own I hit the mission he already did and realize he just didn't know it had to be a mission. Good times.
---
I don't really understand what you're asking.
---
...no.
---
Great story, congrats!! My wife and I play video games together but she just watches and gives me orders lol
---
Shut up, I’m crying. This is beautiful.
---
Congratulations!
---
Lower atom point cost items. And bigger atom rewards. Free all around and keeps people grinding.
---
Dang it this is so cute. Congrats to both of you!
---
Or maybe the option to mod our vending machines to be refrigerated? Because I’d also love to craft difficult food and drink items to sell (like company tea) but they mostly expire before anyone will buy them.
---
We can't comment without being inflammatory so how would you want us to convey our displeasure with the direction Bethesda is going
---
Since you can’t invite us all to the wedding, LIVE STREAM IT!
---
There's like 5 domes left
---
Very Handsome! Congrats!
---
I'm glad this coping mechanism works. I wouldn't say I'm necessarily depressed, but I get anxiety about my job, my kids, my aging stepdad, etc. Gaming helps me take a break from real world expectations, and it's fucking great
---
they took my schtick! I have been being an arrogant prick to piss people off for ages now.
---
Congrats! I wish you all the happiness!
---
your wrong. I demand half spoiled food at all times. its not worth eating if it isn't properly aged and mature. :P
---
This is how I want my wedding to be-
---
I’d have happily paid for a few atoms here and there if they kept to their original promise of no pay to win (or pay for convenience like they like to relabel) microtransactions. They ruined that with repair kits. They got me to stop playing entirely with this fallout first shit. It’s not like they added anything interesting to the game for me since spring. And they’re making the game worse. Now I can barely get any dailys since I have no interest in nuclear winter or the vault raids. I’m not going to pay for a game with no new content I care about when I already paid for the game.
---
They must give two so with green thumb you get 4?
---
Funny enough i did run into the same guy twice 3 weeks apart i know cuz we sent messages to each other was very strange
---
Could be.
---
Or maybe even a 7 day free trial for the first membership? Or maybe that would make it worse idk lol
---
And if you get the Salisbury steak out of the food machine at Sunshine factory, it never spoils and you can get dozens in a few hours from the machine.
---
Source?
---
Lol I’m a loser that switches between accounts to generate conversation and have fake arguments
---
Great story!  I wish you well wastelander
---
So because someone has a different viewpoint than you or wants to protect gaming, that makes them a "whiner" does it? Boy you have a pretty high opinion of yourself shit lol
---
And the other food machine, we could even keep it stocked with perfectly preserved pie from the roof on Wes-Tek
---
If you hide and reach the second circle you can earn 180xp  and sometimes you will end up in the later circles so you can earn 248ish xp, but let’s stick with 180, you would have to run 12 matches per day of just hiding to make 14k xp
---
Oh this hit me right in the feels. I love to see gaming bringing people together like this.
---
What a terrible human being you are damn lol
---
The definition of awhile is actually a period of time. So yes, it was awhile. Awhile to some could be an hour, awhile to some could be six years. Sure, it wasn’t a year, but there’s no constructs in regards to how long someone should wait. We’ve agreed to premarital counseling, we both come from parents who have healthy and long lasting relationships that give us advice, and we actually have managed to handle finances and disagreements well. I’m extremely proud of both of us for taking something so serious with such a great amount of care.
---
yeah. I started on salisbury steak but then figured out I could just let it make the default mac and cheese and not even have to go into the menu to change it.
---
Thursdays
---
Thank you :D , I had done the nukashine quest. Then it kept teleporting me over and over until I hit and infinite loading screen. When I loaded back in it  put me all the way up north lol.  I finished it but I'll have to go back and check out those dailies
---
Oh snap! It’s not Tuesday’s anymore??? I’m out of the loop for sure. Thanks!
---
You can obviously see brigading when the activity in this sub goes beyond what it normally is.  Your average thread around here barely goes higher than 2k upvotes at the most popular if even that, but whenever the youtubers and other subreddits smell fresh blood the whining threads jump up to +9k.
---
I was with my ex for 6 years and as soon as things started to get a little tough she started cheating so she could move into another man's life.
---
Sigh*
---
Storm just killed me
---
I don’t know what exactly triggers that bug to happen. Yesterday I did a few NW matches before getting my daily’s done and they didn’t autofinished. Today they did, all except the „craft 5 sorts of chems“ one. Rest where again kinda easy, so I would have definitely got those 40 atoms.
---
Nothing that's being said about it wasn't said a week ago, people are just fishing for lazy upvotes.  Strictly speaking if the mods weren't giving these kinds of threads a wide berth this would have already been locked for being pure conspiracy bullshitting.
---
Thanks for the edit! I had no idea this was possible and am very happy to learn that it can be done.
---
Did no one notice this guy's troll username or the fact that his account is 1day old? SMH.
---
Yes, we are indeed real, and currently 335 members strong on Facebook.
---
Keep in mind the roadmap we had/have ends with wastelanders. That is/was the 2019 map. Even though it was pushed to early 2020 they aren’t going to add something else to hold us over. As soon as wastelanders drops we will guarantee a new one to be released.
---
I wouldn’t recommend marrying people from the wasteland, paladin.
---
Dude this is actually a neat idea, Screw you Saturdays, double screw drops lol...
---
Can I humble you with an invite to r/PKOA? this alone is brilliant, really appreciate you going out of your way to help others
---
I believe I might be a sufferer but I'm seeing a doc about it soon to confirm the signs are obvious as I know the human mind and certain signs of things but I don't want to "self diagnose" if that makes sense either way though
---
Hell yeah that's a good idea. Don't forget rain and maybe some rad storms.
---
How long have you known this guy lol?
---
Sounds like a recipe for a failed marriage. Don’t marry people you’ve just met.
---
I know. Just my opinions of course.
---
I think fallout 1st was meant to be released in conjunction with wastlanders, but was pushed forward when wastlanders was pushed back to bring in extra revenue for development of the game/wastlanders.
---
Really do hope they can turn the game around. It’s looking more &amp; more than this game is turning into a Fallout: Sims Camp game more than anything else sadly :(
---
And grenades
---
Congratulations!!! That's awesome news!!!
---
Marsupial mutation, climb the fire escape on the side then up to the roof. Pie is sitting next to a chair and some binoculars.
---
Congratulations! I met my wife playing Star Wars Galaxies many years ago now :)
---
**This needs to be fixed! **
---
We paid for this loot bag skin!
---
This ones tough for me honestly. I’m level 45 at 8k/14k I don’t think I am good but every so often i get 400 plus. :(
---
This is really sweet of you!
---
The wasteland needs more of this. If my anxiety didn't go from 0-100 in seconds of having to talk I would probably talk to more players.
---
You forgot to tell Betheada NOT to lock this amazing idea behind a paywall like they do with all the other community suggestions
---
Do you mean drop from inventory?
---
$5/month for communication re: hackers. Another $2 on top of that if you were wrongly banned and want to be reinstated.
---
Beg to differ pal. I have a small house and two side shops, there is nothing in my little house that should interest anyone. Yet people still choose to be dumb and pick the locks despite the fact that I have a sign over the door basically saying no entry. If you wanna go explore peoples camps, go to someone else. I'm not building a museum for everyone else's amusement. I just sell shit.
---
Isn't one month kinda fast to get married? Make sure you two aren't jumping the gun.
---
Sounds good. I'll be on for a while yet tonight.
---
They should release a different piece of the wearable T-51 power armor every year on the games bday until I own the entire set. Take my money Todd! Its just sitting here waiting!!
---
Gonna have to pay to gwt bethesda to fix their own game. Smh
---
It seems that way. But it was likely just a business push as 1st was fully ready to go. How ever you look at the coin for it. It worked and it’s not going way or whatever. 
---
Once it drops it’ll shape up more.
---
&gt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkane/2019/10/18/halloweentime-in-appalachia/amp/?\_\_twitter\_impression=true
---
So awesome! Gonna go see if I can watch the archived video of the entire showcase now.
---
Okay thanks.
---
I take that as a no.. i did find a mod for it... i might give that a go... It was weird that the game threw me into a laggy lobby.. but my next lobby was fine..
---
I turned a lot of settings down, antialiasing is as low as it goes as well as shadow quality.
---
I'm on PS4 so here is my attempt at a video tour of my Halloween-y camp. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGK\_kbA23C0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGK_kbA23C0)
---
Sometimes talking isn't what someone needs. Sometimes someone just needs someone by their side. Either way I'm here to help :)
---
But wait! Pay $100 more a year and we'll explain how worthless reinvesting in this game really is!
---
FFR. 
---
10% damage while aiming is kinda garbage 
---
Vats critical damage is great and can be better than FFR and EXP but you need a pure vats build and 25% less vats cost or 15% faster critical as 3rd perk 
---
FFR is still good but in a rifle man build it’s not as good as explosive because of what you use rifleman for (high damage hits not DPS)
---
Yep. I have zero issues with fallout first. I subscribed.
---
My concern is with future content with this game. I was very disappointed with the removal of survival mode as well without a replacement (nuclear winter isn’t one in my opinion)
---
We will see what they have in store for sure. Sadly, don’t think I’ll be playing until a new content drop from them, which is sad as I love fallout.
---
When looking through your inventory on your pip-boy, after highlighting the power armor chasis, there should be an option to place as well as an option to drop. Placing it just puts it down so you can get in, and if you leave it out for a full minute, or log out, it goes back to your inventory. Dropping it puts it down like how you found it (rather than the standard paper bag drops) with no automatic retrieval, and while you CAN get back in and claim it again, it can also be taken by someone else. Or be lost if you somehow disconnect/ the game crashes.
---
After placing it, you can go into the chasis like it's a container and remove/change the armor peices if you wish. Though tbh you're better off leaving them on the chasis since it condenses the carry weight when you just have the chasis on your inventory rather than wearing it to just the weight of the chasis itself. If you carry each peice individually you'll be hauling way more for no reason.
---
If this is try Bethesda should pay for it and host some kind of in game event.
---
The easiest way is to give it to a friend and then have them give it back to you on a different character. For solo players it’s a little more tricky. Most people either have a second account or use a courier from a reputable source, like trading subreddits. The downside to using a second account is that you have to have a second PC or console. The downside to couriers is that there is usually a fee involved. The ballsiest of all transfers is using a world box, where either you know someone in the server or just hope the person you chose to join off of doesn’t server hop. You can place items in a box, leave the server, and load in on the character you want the items on.
---
Ok boomer
---
That's one easy mistake a lot of people make - the top squads don't get weaker after they go into combat, they get stronger. More aid items, fresher armor, better weapons, more ammo, sometimes the Adrenaline boost. The longer they live, the stronger they are.
---
I have not yet but I will look into it
---
:/
---
I never had any problem with the game despite it's numerous issues but this hacking /cheating thing is so clearly out of control that i am really surprised by their silence .
---
It is literally impossible to play  NW as is right now, and i am sorry , i am bored with adventure . Beside mischief night that was fun ,there really isnt anything else to do there .
---
It won't even affect the people who don't care. They don't even have to look at it lol.
---
We need to start calling their office. Its too easy to ignore a help ticket or email.
---
It'd be awesome if they did something totally un expected like bring out new floors and walls of the gingerbread variety! and snowy versions of the roofs!! id totally buy that stuff haha
---
Yep. I think it will be “Hey, here are some fun Halloween event statistics how many robot were killed etc” with a small blurb at the end for something minor from patch 15 with more details....next week.
---
Survival seasons would be insanely fun to play when it does come out. 
---
I’m wondering if they may push forward the “legendary player” system to push out something.
---
They pushed forward the public event rotation with the last patch (that was supposed to come out early next year)
---
No
---
I cant help but shake the fact that this reads like one of those notes you find next to a dry grey corpse in Appalachia.
---
Maybe. I’m banking on an early xmas stuff.
---
Congrats! He sounds like a lvl 50 3* 
---
Hope hes got all the right perks
---
STR and LCK to you both
---
I hope you have a happy life discovering new locations, learning new recipes, and setting up CAMP together
---
But most importantly I hope you love each other, bugs and all, through any future updates life brings.  
---
Fingers crossed for your own little NPC !
---
ps.
---
enjoy griefing 1st subscribers together forever 😁 mwahaha
---
psn EW-J
---
Had to upvote to make it 76
---
Damn. Freaking nerds lol
---
Yeah. Would be cool to see a Thanksgiving event &amp; a Xmas event in 2019, I have a feeling it will just be Xmas.
---
Making scorchbeasts legendary was one of the best changes they made with Patch 14 &amp; seems to be one of the least talked about.
---
OMG I am so glad you wrote in here.. I've been looking for you guys since I saw the article.
---
Deepness, thanks for sharing!
---
“In a world filled with misery and uncertainty, it is a great comfort to know that in the end, there is a light in the darkness.” - Joshua Graham
---
Congratulations! Best wishes!
---
Agreed. People are already asking for nerfs and buff on effects. This would just throw da rules out the window. 
---
Maybe in one of the other vault raids we could see a component based rolling system for weapons and armour.
---
Might wanna give that guy a Burn Heal for that sick burn you just gave him haha!
---
Thank god someone has a brain round these parts.
---
No. Not at all.
---
I would like to use the laughing emote at player vendors when I see people selling items for outrageous prices
---
I only play private with the wife other then thay i try to spend most of my time in public just chilling out in people cams lol
---
Tbh I’d be cool with a thanksgiving and Xmas event having up gather items akin to a scavengerhunt and have us kill a nice tough boss like the queen. A DC or sheepquatch dressed as turkey or Santa would dank.
---
Well it depends on the time zone you are at really.
---
Glad for you, for a second I thought we were listening to Mr Howard
---
Why? You wanna catch Blinky?
---
Hines' response to a tweet about mtx from August last year literally stated that "Yes, *as we have said* there will be cosmetic ones. And you can buy any of it with in-game currency as well. All the dlc/new content will be free." That was prior to his other interviews where he repeated the statement.
---
😂😂
---
Wow, what an incredibly heartwarming story.
---
Thanks for sharing!
---
Wow, kind of surprised barely anyone is commenting on the fact this game has only been out a year (and that's presuming they met at launch). That's an awfully short time to make what's supposed to be a lifelong commitment. 
---
Especially if they're not even living together. 
---
I mean, you do you I guess, others have made it work... But it just seems a bit rushed - why hurry if you're truly planning to spend the rest of your lives together?
---
they probably heard that fallout 1st users should always get double xp

Glad to see that we can reach out to fellow Wasteland aristocrats.

Youre absolutely right. Better to send out positive vibes and happy thoughts only. Wouldnt want ol reality to interrupt.
---
“Compared to dating less than one year before a marriage proposal, dating one to two years significantly dropped the future likelihood of divorce, about 20 percent lower at any given time point. Dating three or more years decreased the likelihood of divorce at an even greater rate, to about 50 percent lower at any given time point. This suggests that it can be helpful to have at least a few years together prior to entering a marriage.”
---
They don't blow up as dropped items? That makes sense.
---
That’s the point dumb dumb. They don’t think it’s a good idea and want her to look at it.
---
Ah yes, because they're going to call off the whole wedding because someone posted a few paragraphs on their post
---
I agree, and I have not been divorced before. I think people should, at the very least, live together for a year or two before getting married. 
---
It's an entirely different experience and there's bound to be at least a few issues to work through. No relationship if perfect and without a single issue.
---
This is wonderful!
---
Xbox here. Am seeing the same recycled people at least once a week. And seeing everyone at level 70 and above only lately. Hardly new ones.
---
50. Cals and Gat Plasmas are my personal favorites, if you don’t want to run junkies (addictions add damage) furious or anti armor are very good. Secondary perks are explosive, faster fire rate or ADS damage is also good. I’d say reduced weight is better than faster reload but that opinion, also if you want a heavies build make sure to use power armor because there’s really nice perks that benefit heavy weapons
---
I gotta see wedding pics
---
Part of it is that I believe the game tries to put you on servers where you know people, recent players, etc.  So I think this is part of it.
---
Aww :)
---
Oh! You'll get loads of lead with Excavator PA on. Plus there's two secret passage which leads some proper scary stuff!
---
Sorry op. The only way to do that content is by fully mastering the content first.
---
And if you disagree you're trash.
---
Don't expect much from this community on this one. Vault 94 is overtuned garbage that a tiny portion of the already shrunken population bothers to do. 
---
And we like inaccessible content apparantly
---
I've had that happen in adventure. It sucks
---
Hi
---
50.cal is a good weapon.  Weapon selection is personal preference and there’s no obvious “leader” among the heavy weapons in the game.
---
In reality, to a greater extent weapons are governed by RNG than player choice.  If you have good legendary effects on a weapon - that would have a bigger influence on damage than weapon type. (More like “weapon chooses you”)
---
The “meta” builds at the moment (dealing most damage) are Bloody (for PVE) and Junkies (PVP and PVE).  If these builds fit your play style, bloody/junkies primary legendary weapon prefixes is what you would look for.
---
I would recommend having at least 2 main heavies: for medium-long range and short-medium range.
---
Medium-long range: either Gatling Gun or Harpoon Gun.  Primary legendary prefixes for damage (if not a bloody/junkies build): instigating, anti-armour, two-shot.  Secondary legendary prefix: ideally faster fire rate (except for low ammo capacity weapons); other secondary prefixes depend on build/preference.
---
For short medium-range weapons: any of the fast firing  rate weapons 50.cal, Gatling Laser/Plasma, LMG.  Primary legendary prefixes for damage (if not a bloody/junkies build): furious, anti-armour, two-shot.  Secondary legendary prefix faster-fire-rate makes a very big difference in DPS.
---
For a non-bloody build you can try the below reference (this builds leans more to VATS longer range weapons)
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f3246bf&amp;d=sg2sq2s32sr2p02cu0ip2a72a80a32l71lt2lv2lu2ek1ic2a00s01ls2cf1ce0sx0lk0&amp;w=c72cr0i10id2a12sb2sa2pa0p80p90c52ij2if2i30ii0i61i70ia0ik0i50iq2ie2s72at1ag2an2lg2lm2e00p10pe2s20s80eh1ib2&amp;m=51c29fe8&amp;nw=&amp;n=
---
The Gatling Plasmas you are hearing about are probably the Legacy ones.  The non-legacy ones aren’t great. So they don’t drop anymore, and you’ll have to trade.  If you are going with more conventional (non-legacy) I’d target a good Gatling and a good LMG or Minigun.  I’d go for Bloodied Exploding ones if you’re cool with going bloodied, and if you can afford them.
---
It’s actually trying to put you on the local servers with lowest ping whats meant you see people that leave in your area unless you join on someone from your friend list then you will be on his local servers. It used to be the case with NW as well what was resulting in endless waiting for the match.
---
I have never been there so this will be fun. I thank you kind stranger.
---
My wife and I only knew each other a matter of months when I packed up and moved across the country to be with her. My mother had a heart attack and a fit. That was 20 years ago. She’s still the love of my life 😊
---
Wrong communist scum
---
It definitely tries to place you on servers with people on your friends list too.  I end up on servers with friends all the time, even ones who are across the country.
---
*Due to the lack of raiders in Adventure mode, forcing us to work to put in NPCs, your punishment is letting people be raiders by cheating in Nuclear Winter. Plus we have to find out the best candidate for overseer anyhow and it's not you. Have a nice day(dmv bot voice)*
---
Yes.  I usually play late/early depending youre location.
---
I feel like this story is made up... Also very weird you are jumping into marriage so quickly after meeting in a game that's only been out for a year... Annnd here comes the down votes...
---
Embrace democracy, or be eradicated.
---
I have friends from USA on my list and I was never placed on their servers without intentionally joining on them. If I just join the adventure server it’s always European server.
---
It’s coming with Wastelanders sometime.  🤷‍♂️
---
Go back to Alaska.
---
This absolutely a pr shit post. Lmao ok Bethesda (boomer).
---
Yea you have to constantly play it though start now so you get it.
---
I’m put of friends servers constantly.  It can’t be coincidental.  Nearly every server I’m on has at least one of my friends. Unless I’m just super popular and I know everyone. 🤷‍♂️
---
*Disconnected from Server*
---
I was thinking this yesterday or a wtf emote.
---
Bring a couple of spare pairs of pants! If you can't find the secret passages, gimme a shout. Again, double up on the pants.
---
While I'll agree it's fairly subjective, 15 minutes can be quite awhile when waiting for food or being late, in terms of marriage I would think the vast majority of people would not consider a few months to be "awhile". 
---
Just planning a wedding takes most people a year or more. Although I presume this is probably a courthouse wedding?
---
That's not to say you're making the wrong choice or it won't work out but you can't deny it's all happening rather quickly.
---
A game can only survive so long without endgame content
---
Here is my heavy gunner build maybe it will help you find some inspiration ;) and 50cal is great https://youtu.be/8U6nJrc8s58
---
There's exceptions to every rule but most research indicates couple together for at least a couple years before marriage have much lower divorce rates. 
---
And if you're truly ready to make a lifelong commitment what's another year or two? 
---
It's not like there's much to be gained by rushing it.
---
"My kids will know their mum meet their pop in the wasteland"
---
You like the thicc huh? ;)
---
I changed mine while in game. Nothing happened.
---
Good prefixes: Bloodied, Junkies, Instigating, Furious, Anti Armor, Vampires
---
Good secondary: Exploding, Faster Fire Rate, VATS Crit
---
Two-Shot is overrated and not good, avoid it.
---
It was strange tho. The game locked up on me actually. There was a lot of explosions around me and my character died and was blown from that spot. I “gave up” but nothing happened when I tried to respawn.   Eventually I had to close the game and restart.
---
Pro? Game can barely run on mine. I've tried fresh installs.
---
I did it last night and they were there, sometimes events/quests don't get marked in the data section of the pipboy so the targets don't show up on the map, that might be what happened
---
Happens to me a lot when I join scorched Earth
---
Always seems pretty a lively and varied group in Oceania.
---
Is there a way you can tell that your base was trying to spawn on a tent?
---
I met my husband on a game in the 90’s.  We’ve been together 21 years and married 18.  Hope he’s you gamer for life.
---
Wtf
---
I sometimes get on to Oceania servers as well, I am on PC and I recognize certain people all the time.
---
Bloodied and Instigating are two of the best.  Instigating is horribly underrated by most.  
---
On the flip side, Two Shot Exploding is the most overrated weapon type in the game.
---
It’s been a consistent bug with me. I can usually find the groups of wolves but not this time.
---
Thank you all so much for your replies. I will do the dailies while hitting up the event as it appears. I greatly appreciate the help.
---
max caps for a bottle of oak holler lager
---
Better than, "we're not planning to do anything about it."
---
Ew, a paywalled private club. I pay people to grind my character and on the weekends I end up playing with only the best streamers and youtubers with the rarest gear. Nice to see the middle class rising up though. Have fun grinding pleabs.
---
I don't have a pro but hear something about turning off anti-aliasing on that system
---
Spawning on you now, gl :D
---
They were removed and added as a perk for those with fallout 1st.
---
Such a great song. "sure I'm crazy...crazy in love..." :)
---
They could introduce only on 1st servers.  Yes their "friends" would have access, but only when a 1st member is on the server.  The public servers would just never be updated.  Bethesda seems very creative in their approach and dedication to "pay to play" and "pay to win" and "pay for nothing/everything/anything"
---
Its what I'm expecting.  You can say "I told you so" IF it doesn't happen.
---
X box one?
---
TSE isn’t great, WAY overrated.  The BE Lever is great.  Get yourself a B25 weapon for mid/short range and the SBQ (75% explosive resistance).  The B25 Fixer or Handmade would be the top tier weapons, with the combat rifle as probably the next tier and a good value.
---
Congratulations! I met my hubby in World of Warcraft. 😊 Thirteen years and three kids later, he's still my favorite person. I hope you guys have many more gaming and real life adventures ahead!!
---
Ba dum tss
---
That they are worried about the games community and not some trolls on reddit? No not at all.
---
&gt; Like taking out all the pay to win things they added out of the atom store/fallout first (repair kits, scrap box, fridge, scrap robot), stop charging us for the ideas we gave them (fridge, mini camp both come to mind), actually give us the updates they promise
---
all of those things take time. And what do you think would happen if right now, Todd Howard himself came right into this thread, and apologised personally to you, tigress666? Would you reinstall the game? Would you buy a 1st sub? I'm guessing you wouldn't, and most of this subreddit would descend like flying monkeys to "stick it" to ol' Todd.
---
TSE is pretty bad post nerf.  People still pay way too much for them though, so you can probably trade for something decent.  I absolutely wouldn’t ever use a TSE unless the rest of your weapons suck or something.
---
Yes, sure, though I just thought he said PC
---
Getting rid of Fallout 1st will definitely help retain players...
---
Liberty Prime __*heavy breathing*__
---
I read that in the Mayor of Grafton's voice...
---
Congrats! But I really expected an "Epstein didnt kill himself" tag at the end, would have been perfect for it. There's always another chance when ya send out wedding invitations ;) congrats again!
---
If this is accurate (first time I heard of it), I still don’t see how it’s the 2nd best secondary.  Exploding is 20% (plus splash damage), FFR is 25%, VATS50 can be incredible with the right Luck perks, etc.  So maybe it’s 3rd or 4th? 🤔
---
I have a flier for you
---
FFR doesn’t work well on a sniper rifle like a Lever because it only raises the rate of fire from 5 to 6,  Exploding or VATS50 are the stronger choices.  With supporting Luck perks, VATS50 is probably the best choice. FFR works better on a commando build in general, but it’s still useful on something like a Fixer or Handmade as a Rifleman,
---
Fallout Community:"Please ban (x) username for cheating"
---
Bethesda: "We are aware of this problem and are investigating it."
---
Todd:"We cant keep someone hired to handle reports, fire that person and ignore every request"
---
Bethesda employees:"Ok, now what?"
---
*Todd breathing heavily looking to add private servers and NW together*
---
Lame story.  But happy for you folks.
---
Honestly that would be better than not even addresing the problem
---
The things Arthur deals with are very real things people in the world deal with that often makes people uncomfortable to think about: child abuse and abandonment, personality disorders, bullying from kids and harassment from adults, and ostracizing the ones who are seen as weaker from society.The worst part of haveing a mental illness people expect you to behave if you dont have one
---
The game hasn’t been out for a year yet...
---
They've been a bit buggy, sometimes showing, others not so much. Heck, all last week during mischief night I'd kill all three pack alphas and the horde wouldn't spawn. Went back to normal as soon as mischief night ended.
---
Yea I run a sneak bloodied crit shotgun build. Suppressors on the combat/pump.  I also have a quad explosive db that likes to tag things too. I can post the perk cards if needed, 4 leaf has great synergy with shotguns
---
I'd rather do a trade than caps. If you want to do caps, make an offer. I'm trying to build a decontamination shower and am low on the stable flux(es).  Do you have any of those?
---
Ohhhhh my goodness, that would be perfect!
---
So tired of going to the bathroom, coming back and seeing more caps than I had, and must go through the laborious process of figuring out what was purchased. Discounting making the game not crash, a vendor log would be my primary QoL improvement for this game.
---
"IS THAT SOMEBODY WHO NEEDS ME TO KICK THEIR ASS?"
---
This happens way too often and they don't do anything about it.   
---
A fix has been in the works for months, apparently.
---
I'll take shit that never happened for 500 Alex
---
I think that plant should just be made an operational workshop. Like the mining drill you would have to maintain it. In this case it would involve getting the necessary syrups stocked in the machine, adding in the sugar, and then adding in the flavoring.
---
It is totally hilarious how clueless you'd need to be to think a private subreddit or any of that other garbage was even necessary. What a tool.
---
Yes it is possible. Play solo and pick spawn locations away from everything but at least 1/3rd in from edge of map so you have a higher chance of being in second circle. Use perk cards for run speed so you can easily follow the circles in as they collapse.
---
Well I'm sure the aspect that Bethesda thought it would be a great idea to make a online multi player rpg game private??? Not sure what there doing.
---
I had a molerat guy hunting me from the ground ... he would pop up to shoot and go back down under the terrain . Recorded ,sent to bethesda and actually did not see him again . 
---
Wish it was that easy dealing with aim botters :/
---
Beta test is a good idea
---
However, it should be open for everyone.  Also, FO1st subscribers (as a group) may not be the best category for play testers.
---
There's a lot of unsolicited relationship advice here. Congrats on the wedding, and I hope things go well in your future
---
You are AWESOME for this, friend.
---
Please explain. Do you mean waiting for matches?
---
Bloodied shotguns do great dmg in pve. All shot guns are fairly terrible in pvp due to the slow fire rate and 110 max dmg cap.
---
That's what im saying! I'll step outside for a smoke and comeback in to find out someone has bought stuff. I check the machines to see what might've been purchased but I do forget. 4 machines with a capacity of 30 items each, it's hard to track sometimes lol.
---
Right?! I mean... da fuq? Is this person for realz?
---
I've had 2 family members pass away this year, I don't think they need to be put into something they knew absolutely nothing about. I do think it really sucks to lose someone so young, yet y'know. They wouldn't have really known anything.
---
Do hope the couple find some peace eventually, but grieving for now is a good thing to do.
---
I honestly think we should be able to make Nuka Cola but at the cost of:
---
\- 1x Empty Nuka Cola Bottle
---
\- 1x Bottle Cap
---
\- 2x Syrup (made from Glowing Resin)
---
\- 5x sugar (Have you seen how sugary that stuff is?)
---
\- 1x Boiled Water
---
Hm, but what about the other flavors...
---
Quantum would likely use nuclear matierlas and muttfruit given the tart yet sweet taste it is said to have.
---
We already have Nuka Dark
---
Nuka Grape would use muttfruit like how Grape Mentats does
---
Nuka Wild...not sure what we could do for that. Maybe mix up the recipe a bit by using ginseng which is found in game?
---
Nuka Orange....yeah not sure again. I mean Orange mentats exist, but don't use oranges either so a similar style?
---
Nuka Cranberry: Same as first recipe but with 2x or 3x cranberries
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Now yes, one may say "Oh, but can't you sell them for more than the cost of making them". Well of course, but the same stands true for most items, I mean just look at the civil war stuff or the marine helmet. Would also be nice to be able to have a functioning Nuka Cola vending machine (preferably a Fallout 3 or New Vegas model) that could give an "Ice Cold" condition to the drink which would deteriorate like how alcohol ferments. It could actually use the same code. Once chilled it would have so much time before it becomes a regular one. Could also be done for alcohol.
---
One should not need an eidetic memory to play a game like this, no.
---
Good bot
---
Have you seen the size of those radrats?! They'd have to be mutated bobcat kittehs to collect the radrat meat!!!!
---
I don’t care if he apologizes to me. I care about what Bethesda does to the game. I want actions, not words.
---
Yeah.  I'm here as well.  It wouldn't take much for them to say something like, "But that was before we did all this sweet stuff with Wastelanders and made it a NEW game in and of itself .... NOW, FREE with a subscription to FO 1st, NEW FO 76 Wastelanders"
---
Maybe cash them in for scrip?
---
Time survived is what gets you the most XP. You can easily manage 500 without ever firing a shot. A friend had teammates who just equipped aqua boy and stayed in the water by the dam until the fire got them to farm XP. 
---
Winning a match could net you around 1k XP.
---
50 cal for real. No barrel spin up time which gets annoying if you're getting staggered.
---
I'd love to have the Whitespring all decked out for the holidays and all the special bots send us on mini-quests to get them stuff they need, and the Nuka-Cola Vendor, Bubbles, sends us on a quest to find the recipe for Nuka-Cola Cranberry!
---
A revive in Nuclear Winter gets you 20xp, which is the same amount of xp as killing a player. So I heard this plan from someone on the internet: 2 people go into a nuclear winter match. They build a set of stairs, high enough to kill upon falling off. They take turns jumping off and getting revived, earning 20xp for the reviver each time. I've been grinding out this game mode by hiding in bushes, but I only get like 200xp after hiding for like 10 minutes. I feel like this reviving thing could lead to significantly higher xp gains than Bush camping. I figured other people would want to get the glowing skeleton costume as well and somebody would want to try this out with me, see how much xp we get after 30 minutes and see if its worth our time to continue.
---
That's why I said, the ones who don't care doesn't even have to look at it. It won't affect you in anyway.
---
I'll do it with you
---
Lit, let's pm
---
 It's the thirst, thirstiest time, of the year (Ay) (Yah)  
---
I have just one query (What's that?)  
---
*Wanna Nuka Cranberry?* (Uh huh)  
---
The answer is cleeeeeeeeeeeeeear
---
Congratulations.  👍
---
You better start sticking up on lead now. 😜
---
It's less about the facts and more about the unsolicited relationship advice.
---
Well, can't say the game is all bad if something good comes from it.
---
I’d think you’d need to play with a Bloodied Combat Shotgun to do decent damage. Instigating or Junkies are probably solid too. Other than those, I’d think it would be pretty rough.
---
Yep, usually see someone I've met before. And I literally see the same 5 people every time I hop into Nuclear Winter as well.  In fact, funny story, I played 4 rounds of NW and got the same guy in my team each time, and after that, I STILL saw him in the server but on a different team.
---
I honestly would have gave you one if you had just asked nicely lol. I had an extra fireman.
---
Lol fail
---
That’s a great weapon to pull out every Sunday for some fun, then spend the rest of the week farming ammo!
---
In all seriousness congrats.  Traded a furious FFR LmG to a friend because I just couldn’t keep up with ammo and I still miss it from time to time.  That weapon was a monster.
---
I can understand that.
---
If they were smart they would. At least live with the person a full damn year before you decide if you really love them or not. 
---
News flash, you don’t know a person until you live with them. When people rush marriage like this it indicates immaturity and speaks to their inexperience in the dating field.  A good rule of thumb is to date for at least two years, living together for at least 6 months.
---
I'm currently role-playing as a big game Hunter who doesn't eat meat - Herbivore mutation, Mountaineer outfit and black cowboy hat - but I've been slowly collecting a full set of 3* urban scout armor, so I can show my Enclave pride. RP in my head makes these games even better.
---
I mean congrats and all, but fallout 76 released like a year ago. Moving a little bit... fast are we?
---
OH MAN AHAHAHAH nah that was a troll comment my man to mock fellers who say stuff like that but look at all this beautiful -43 downvotes I now have! I'm so proud of myself :(
---
Thank you for the reply. I am confused as to why all the armour pieces are now gone after putting it in my inventory.
---
Dude, people were doing this on day 1 of NW. They all got banned for boosting. Don't do it.
---
Why don't you ask him what he wants?
---
This post smells of corporate propaganda, cool story boomer
---
You're probably making a mistake, but have fun and learn from it when it blows up.
---
Same here.
---
At least live with the persona for a year before you decide. They way you type makes you seem really immature and naive. Not trying to shit on you, but you’re making a mistake. If it works out then great, but you’d be in the minority. A lucky coincidence. For the majority, marriage this early doesn’t work. You don’t know each other (moms knowing each other doesn’t count) nearly well enough to know that this is a good decision. I can’t believe that people vouching for him is enough for you.. you need to know him yourself, not through what what other people say and what you think you know.
---
Oh shit, thanks for warning me. However, I find that a little strange considering how Bethesda doesnt even ban people who are flying and using aimbot. I couldnt find anybody reporting this online, do you remember where you heard this from?
---
Hit the Lucky Hole once a week already.  Once its Prime  Ultracite .308 is a lot cheaper to make than regular .308.  I have a Zealots Prime LMG I will probably be selling now.
---
It’s up on HOAs YouTube :) Megs, Time, and Paper are all from my group chat :)

“Death is preferable to communism.”

Congratulations! I love it when that happens. Love Billy Holiday too.

My hunter wears the ragstad outfit. My russian sniper, the ski outfit and wrapped cap. But my favourite has to be the explorer outfit plus green hood and a Pipe Bolt rifle.
---
gratz
---
Ya im on pc
---
I heard it from me. I was there when all of them were doing it. There were level 200 players on day 1, it was ridiculous. They all got banned. Players are just now getting past the level 200 mark, with a handful on the way to level 300.
---
Yeah the Ultracite is definitely more efficient to make if you have the flux.
---
you’re not allowed to criticise a product unless you’ve purchased it.
---
This is in fact not really great as it is speculated that games that make you mundane shit like collecting daily coins etc fuel your depression even further as it creates a pseudo feeling of completing daily goals and causing addiction which is developed in the same part of the brain as depression.
---
If you are suffering from depression, **do not see the OP in the Appalachia**, start walking to places as an exercise, then start running, then try switching to properly working out, organize and reorganize your living space, pick up a new easy hobby such as cooking, try adopting an animal, change your diet etc.
---
If you like playing vidya, try play story centric games or at least games that 
---
* have a definite ending
---
* don't force you to do shit everyday
---
* don't need you to log in everyday
---
if all else fails see a professional. 
---
and stop playing games like wow, fo76 etc if you have depression.

---
PS: I’ve got a few 3* VE Miniguns on the PC if you’re looking to expand the arsenal.
---
Not in my case. Damage is broken so I hit enemies and the game can't read damage, so they regenerate health. I need ten shots to kill most things.
---
I haven't really been on public servers much lately except when I want to vendor hop.
---
I need to spend more time on them though because I have a backlog of stuff to sell that's been building up.
---
Also I've been splitting time away for other games more now because I bought gamepass to play OW and now I'm hooked on Horizon 4.
---
Thanks again, but are you sure they were doing this revive thing? This is not going to get us anywhere near level 200 (I get 20 xp every like 10 seconds) and it seems like those people were just hacking the game
---
wait people have came. naughty naughty
---
If you're looking to be kind of tanky, I'd suggest a Vampire's Explosive Reduced Weight minigun.  It'll do decent damage, and you won't need to heal as much as usual.
---
They said that Fallout 1st players would get an increase at some point.
---
If you are suppressors and stealth, why not just use rifles lol
---
yeah in NW you ride the wave with a group.  it takes 4min for the first pop then instant after that
---
Good idea! I'd also like a screen in my terminal where I can see what I got in the last event.  A lot of times I'm still fighting and can't pay attention to what I won so then I have to go through my backpack to try to figure it out.
---
I hate bullet sponge enemies. I'd rather have a firefight with more enemies that have responsiveness than shooting the same damn Mirelurk again and again. I want to have responsiveness in my encounters, which bullet sponges don't give. I'm not saying don't have tough enemies, but it's frustrating when your choices are shotgun, melee, or using more ammo than god.
---
I do understand and accept that enemies are too easy for those with a proper build, which is its own kind of frustrating.
---
Betcha Bethesda thought hey kids love Battle Royale mode so lets add it without seeing how hackers attack those games so extensively like Fortnite and Pubg but now they in too deep and have no way to fight back against hackers unless they want to pay a company for the software to fight hackers.
---
I 100% agree. Their single player stories are good, but not incredible. Their worlds are amazing though. Packed full of detail, fun flow, interesting locations, good reasons to explore. Exploring Fallout 4's map is honestly one of my favorite gaming memories ever.
---
It might depend on the region, but in my region at least (Oceania/Aus/NZ) there don't seem to be many server instances running at a time. When I server hop within my region, I often connect to the same server unless I exit to desktop and relog from there. Whenever I do that, I get a different server to the last time. What I've found is that at any given point, I seem to only cycle between around three servers.
---
If other games are any indication, NA regions seems to be busier and I assume would have more concurrent server instances, but if you're seeing the same friends and players often - it may be because your region doesn't have many servers running at that time.
---
Fallout 76 is hosted on AWS where BGS likely pays per hour, per instance - so pulling down extra instances when there are less players and consolidating them onto a smaller number of servers saves BGS money. It's much cheaper to have 48 players filling two servers, than to have 10 near-empty servers running. You can witness this in action if you stay on a server long enough. Eventually, that server will stop connecting new people (unless they directly join your session), and eventually when all other players leave you'll be the only one on the server because that instance is ready to shutdown once you leave and isn't connecting any new players. At that point, you essentially have a free private server because the game is consolidating new player sessions on a smaller subset of busier instances.

Awesome idea! I too have this issue lol

I think there are so many other, more interesting things that could be done with level up trees than "Run to max".
---
The story is so beautiful con grats
---
it's legit no worries
---
A very small bulge appeared on front of Todds pants that day.
---
No clue what these terms you are using mean.  “Grapeshot”? “Hitscan”?
---
Did I? 
---
Must have been desperate, lol. I don't usually like running grenades. :D
---
This was on Xbox, not PC. Yes, I'm sure. I know the people who scour the game for exploits, and I can confirm this was 1 of 2 exploits that were found when NW launched (the other one had to do with completing challenges). Bethesda took immediate action on both exploits. They banned the players for the revive boosting and disabled challenges.
---
There were groups of players getting together with melee weapons and downing most of a team so that the surviving player could revive them. Hundreds of XP every minute. Line 'em up, knock 'em down, revive, repeat.
---
That makes much more sense, thank you!
---
Funny part it was leaked that crossplay support was cancelled due to state of PC lol. You sure you don't work for Bethesda theoneandonlyallah?
---
You can always look me up if you’re looking for an adult gamer who trades a ton. IGN: LordZarak.
---
id kind of rather it get more powerful receivers, including that of Aerodynamic (+50% projectile speed), High Explosive (more damage, increased blast radius) Plasma Cannon Overhaul (changes ammo to plasma cores, 10 shots per core, no blast radius) and Rad-iciouls (Cannonballs explode like mini nukes for half mini nuke damage)
---
He thinks it should work like a shotgun. Not a bad idea.
---
Add me. andreslamantis. Really want to roleplay a BoS medic and start fresh. Will have to kill a character for that, but it Is ok. Just don't go crazy if I don't play every day.
---
Gold panning sounds painfully dull. Go to river, use gold pan, repeat. Drink Rad X. Use item. Watch emote. I'd rather shoot things. It would have to be its own minigame.
---
Maybe pick a game with less exploitative developers, though. They're only going to hurt you more trying to squeeze more money out of you.
---
Alright, thanks. I'll definitely keep that in mind but I think that I'll be ok since I'm only getting 11,000 xp for this, not hundreds per minute. Just so that I know, do you remember how Bethesda went about it? Did they notice they were too high level or did they detect their xp gain or what? I mean I'll be getting less xp per game than whoever wins the match, so if they only banned them for being so high level then I'll be good.
---
Get your anti-Bethesda hate out of here. This isn't a post to bash Bethesda and their business strategy. Pleas leave comments like that out.
---
Personally hoping they just allow unlimited storage of foods that don't spoil since its small values like scrap.
---
Imagine grapeshot works like buckshot in shotguns.
---
I see the same.  Way more low level players than in the past.  I used to see maybe 1-2 players that were below level 5, now I see around 8 when I play. 
---
I also haven't been in a world that has been nuked since fo 1st launched.  Either advanced players are playing less or they are all moving to private worlds.  Makes for a much different/worse playing experience for lower/mid levels.  I remember when I first started, I loved watching the high level players at the different events to see how to play and what items I should try to get.
---
Lol no my real wife xD this isn't runescape lol someone posted how they met there S.O on 76 the other day who are getting married soon.
---
Sorry man but I think it's pretty poor exploiting vulnerable people and that's Bethesda's business strategy now.
---
I would love this but I can't see Bethesda implementing this feature due to amount of work it would require. But dang if they added this we could get teams to hold down the queen while we melee her to death in a few minutes.
---
There were trees last year, silver, pink, blue, and green metallic artificial ones. I bought them, the elf suit, and the reindeer antlers, and I think that's all. I am about 90% sure there was a santa suit as well.
---
Grapeshot is a reference to an old cannon loading that was a can filled lead balls approximately the size of grapes.  It was a brutal weapon on the battlefield. 
---
Hitscan just means he wants it to be splash damage.
---
Don't derail my post. I am touching on a VERY serious topic that A LOT of people in the world suffer from and do not know how to cope with it. 
---
If you want to bad mouth Bethesda make your own fucking post.
---
This game is indeed horribly broken and wouldnt recommend, but its times like this the best times can happen :) congrats to you two am happy for yas.
---
The best raider. ❤
---
I have a few different mental illnesses, one of those being depression. 76 is a great escape because of the good friends I've made through the game. I've had days where I just couldn't stop crying, but I wanted to play, so I joined up with them and PMed them saying "I won't be talking, bad day, but I'm here" and they just let me hang out quietly until I was ready to talk. Super great group of guys. Great post, OP. You're doing awesome. Keep being you ❤❤
---
First, a disclaimer; this is not a defense of Fallout 1st, just an honest observation about what I'm seeing. 
---
 Don't misunderstand, I'm not a fan, nor am I a defender of Fallout 76.  But the outcry against it here doesn't line up with what I am seeing in the game.  I'm seeing survival tents all over the place and the  Ranger outfit is  a common sight.  Most people I play with have signed up for it. 
---
Basically, there are people speaking out against it on youtube and Reddit, but people who are signing up for the service are just using it and playing the game and not really saying much online.  I hate to say it, but there is a disconnect  between Fallout 76's online community and the community in the game world.
---
gratz dude that's awesome
---
Or they could release something free to celebrate the game’s birthday. It would be a nice gesture to the community for still supporting the game.
---
Actually friend your incorrect. Server jumping was nerfed hardcore so game tries to throw you back to a small group of people plus if one of them is your friend they also try to add you to that server. On xbox we can get around that "Feature" by joining off random users on xbox club system.
---
Thank you :)
---
Stop down voting me for trying to help 😂
---
Bethesda typically doesn't announce their bans or their reasoning behind it. I don't know what triggered it, only that they were banned before the first week of NW was over.
---
I'm the opposite. I was happy until I started playing Fallout 76.
---
Yea like I said I wish the best for you guys but be a little self aware of the fact that you guys are moving fast.
---
Weird that I get downvoted from just asking the meaning of words.   Kids these days....Stay off my lawn!
---
Sent you a private message
---
Then you should find something else to help cope.
---
From met to dating to proposed and wedding date and planning kids in under 12 months....
---
I've seen 0 hackers, obviously you just lack skills and can't play the game right! And Bethesda would never of added a Battle Royale mode if they thought they couldn't handle the hackers! (Sarcasm)
---
Get your hands on a junkies exploding .50 HMG and a junkies Gatling gun. They own everything... I run heavy too and 5 addictions as well for that sweet 50% dam bonus... here’s my explosives/heavy build.

"Mission: the destruction of any and all Chinese communists"
---
How about just fix the jukebox so it can play music the owner likes.  I deleted mine the first day.  I’d even buy records for it with atoms.
---
Its the new feature, it helps players feel incentive to buy atoms due to reduction in atoms you can get normally. *Bethesda always adding featured bugs to help improve the game.*
---
Oh man yes. Maybe some walls with fake decorations on them like swag with ribbons or something.
---
The fusion core burn in PA vats is obscene, sadly.
---
Ah.
---
Alright, this makes a lot of sense. But it is really easy to say and far more difficult to do. When you're deep in the shit, the most menial tasks are mountainous. But you're right.
---
Can't argue with free!
---
If you're on PC, I'd love to run with you and your team. I've been trying to find a group to learn it all with, since majority of my attempts have been failures, but everybody in said groups still has a laugh and decides to try it all again later, even if it isn't really *clicking* with us what we're doing/not doing!
---
They have a point IMO. Gaming is a healthy hobby and a great tool for coping, but 76 has become so psychologically manipulative and exploitative that recommending it to vulnerable people is questionable at best.
---
Why does broadside suck?  I've got a 2 shot explosive broadside that seems awesome to me
---
"Fallout 76 - IRL Wastelander edition - It just works!"

Congratulations to you both &lt;3
---
You met your soon-to-be husband on a game that's slightly over a year old?
---
Are you each paying $100+/year to play the game as it should be played!?
---
No shit.
---
Even if they haven't known each other for a year? People are vouching for him to her, she doesn't even know his full lifestyle.. Let alone lived with him to determine how it would be for the rest of her life. Im not saying for them to end it, but wouldn't it be safer to wait, and not get married within a year.
---
"Blessed," that's your first mistake.
---
Yikes, ok thanks again. Also I'm not downvoting lol idk who's doing it
---
I believe that's just on the private world's, not the public adventure mode
---
Shotguns are really viable until they fix the dmg bug.  Also youll always be hurting for plastic to make shells.
---
Are they aware of the tesla damage bug? Been in the game since launch...
---
I'm not derailing your post, I'm just sharing my thoughts. It's actually concerning how strongly you're reacting to this.
---
It can’t be that way.  If so, what happens when they log into an open server? Only half their camp displays?  Clearly it has to work for 1st members in all modes, unless I’m missing something.
---
Lol, you’re me.
---
- traumatic childhood, check
---
- saviour complex, check

---
I could go on.  Cptsd is a bitch
---
Yep, can't agree with this more.
---
76 is one of the worst games a vulnerable person could form a relationship with. Bethesda are committed to being probably the most toxic live service developer outside of the Asian MMO market.
---
Not even Rockstar went as far as FO1st.
---
man I'm glad that I haven't suffered from depression but my GF is kinda vulnerable, it is one hell of a beast to tackle especially without medication but I've done some research about it and have been helping her for years now and with some proper motivation it is something one can overcome or at least suppress.
---
and I'm sorry that I replied to your post in a rather aggressive manner friend, I just didn't want my post to get buried deep and you had the most upvoted post! :)
---
That’s interesting. I use ffr on two characters, one with a lever gun and one with a pump shotgun. Seems to work 25% faster for me. The difference is distinct and clearly noticeable when using the same type of gun without ffr.
---
I've been lazy, going to start launching nukes. Didn't need to previously as everyone else did. As a L320something I should start giving back by picking up the nuke slack
---
what do you feel about gambling op? I for one enjoy it once every full moon, lose/win some predefined amount of cash and have a jug of beer (or two sometimes I hate to admit). I don't think I have a gambling addiction, I am not against gambling industry but I see where people who are against it are coming from and why people get addicted and lose their entire life savings.
---
now, fo76 is an online open world rpg (some don't want to use mmorpg for it and given that you are extra sensitive about bethesda Iw won't use it either) and as a business model, like many other similar games like Destiny, Division, WoW and all other mmorpgs out there it rewards daily sessions rather than a long once-a-week one. it is designed this way to give you incentive to do shit everyday, makes the game more engaging and all those challenges act as mini quests. 
---
by now you're getting where I'm going with all this.
---
like gambling, if exercised by vulnerable people, fo76 can easily turn into an addiction, the game has the required mechanics. its not to bash bethesda, game would be worse without daily challenges and quests. however OP addictions, especially video game addictions, fuel depression. 
---
fo76 like many other games such as wow is the cause of depression for some fellers, thus making it impossible for it to a be a cure like you envisioned. I know you mean well but this is not helpful, if someone who is playing fo76 daily has a depression, best thing for that lad to do is to stop playing fallout 76 and exercise different hormone releasing activities whether, preferably, psychical or mental such as completing a book, finishing a video game etc
---
Something changed with these recently.  After they were fixed I would grind them all every day. Would land at least one a day, often times two.  Then recently... they went dry again. Been doing Stings and Things, Operation Tidy daily and Campfire Tales 3-4 times a week and haven’t gotten a badge in a couple weeks. 
---
Something changed. 🤔😡
---
Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it.
---
Chinese isn't a language, so that has always annoyed me.
---
Underrated comment
---
Thanks for the explanation.
---
I have a bloodied commando build, bloodied pistol build. This post was regarding shotgun builds
---
Quest markers have been super buggy lately.  They either dont show, show as a distant door marker or show up eventually after a random amount of time has passed.
---
Yes, this is pretty much a day1 issue. just try to give the game a little more time when first loading in and you should be fine!
---
Theres much to be gained by a divorce. 50% to be precise.
---
I guarantee you something changed about 2-3 weeks ago.  When Stings and Things/Operation Tidy got fixed, I would grind them every day.  Amassed 30+ badges in not too long. In the past 2-3 weeks... nothing. That’s not RNG. Something changed...
---
!REMINDME 1 YEAR 
---
Check divorce status
---
Very possible.
---
Get aquaboy perk to hide in the water. Marathoner and/or Actionboy to keep yourself moving from danger.
---
Hide in bushes...while hiding in bushes enter photomode and use a pose that has you sitting or laying on the ground to further decrease your visibility.
---
Get good at using your camp on the fly. Barricade yourself for protection.
---
Your main goal should be to make it til you are in yhe top 10.
---
Earn about 400xp per game that takes like 20 mins.
---
If you're on PC then it will be a lot more rough due to hackers.
---
I can’t see how this could possibly go wrong.
---
Ironically They banned several of the people who had been finding, reproducing and reporting the exploits the other week.....  
---
So it's likely to get worse
---
Nuka Grape is pretty much like an Extra Life power up. Heals you and takes away rads. Only sucks if you are a bloodied build.
---
what
---
But... b-but... you're ***hot***. How is this possible?!
---
Once mods come they will have to separate private and public characters I’d think
---
I don't know about that, but I know that when I was logging in to do Mischief Night, if cars started blowing up as I logged in, I'd get a freeze, then crash, and when I relogged in, my quests would have all autocompleted. Lost around 60 Atoms to that bug.
---
Ah so I can earn more badges and buy the plan then trade it?
---
Washout also has the problem where Novice doesn't force you to learn about pipes and pump codes. This causes a "OMGWTF" moment because you don't know what the heck is going on on top of seeing your time drop to 30 seconds.
---
The ONLY thing that 1st offers that arguably should be a paid service is private servers. Everything else should be available to everyone. And even private servers, I say shouldn't be free, when it comes to Fallout 76 specifically. In almost any other games, I'd be fine with private servers being a paid feature. But when it comes to 76, it should be free to everyone because the game runs SOOOOOOOO much more smoothly when there's only a few players on a server.
---
A good example are those Mr Prize Bot quests. You find the bot, follow it from point A to point B and get some rewards. Boring as shit. But if you're on a server with only a handful of people and get that quest, all of a sudden there's enemies that spawn to try to attack the bot. It's like an actual quest now. There's other examples, like the game just performing better, but if the game is really night and day when there's many people on a server vs when there's only a few people on a server, then now Bethesda is charging money, on top of what we already paid, to get a functional game. That's bullshit.
---
Yes.
---
Right on you just earned me some brownie points.
---
Just trying to spread useful information where needed. Good luck!
---
Oooh! You are so strong and manly with your mathiness!
---
What a derp. If you don't understand the direct correlation between percentages and probability, you are truly a product of the American educational system. Good work, lad.
---
The bigger question is why would you need them? They're readily available in both amusement parks. The blade mod for them dropped on an infiltrator early on,
---
Ughhhh, I’ve got the basic backpack from Morgantown airport but the idea of having to grind that damn list sucks lol. I’m working on Tadpole Cook 1/9, Hunter 3/9 and Medic 4/8 right now. I feel like a scrub running around with this big old skinless backpack on my back!
---
Smaller for sure. How steadily it's decreasing I can't say, but servers are less and less populated in my experiences.
---
Maybe a patch that actually makes the game functional. Only took them a year...
---
I dig the Christmas gifts under the tree, that’s legit
---
I needed to go through it a few more times when there were few people involved. Jester had some *very* interesting dialogue bits that would come out now and then but I missed most in the freeze-frame nature and constant car explosions. 
---
For instance, they mention that they used to work at the Whitesprings but were forced out for some reason and that this was getting back at the other robots. They talked about having to keep their real identity a secret and a few other bits.
---
But trying to listen, all you get was *boom* *boom* *ghoul attack rads* *game unfreezes for three second* *CARBOOM* … and then they've gone so far away that you can't hear them talk anymore.
---
They had lines triggered by where you were along the quest, so just listening to them at Freddie's House won't give you the story, either.
---
Grump.
---
Trading posts are no longer allowed on /r/fo76. There are a multitude of trading subreddits available - please submit to a trading subreddit of your choice instead. If your post is not about making a trade, please message the subreddit moderators using the link at the end of this message and they'll take a look at your post for you.
---
I haven't earned a single one since the last patch. Prior to that, Ive earned 4 in the past 2 months. They broke this and can't fix it.
---
Yeah, this is day 1. I always crouch, look down at the ground and take about 20 seconds before I do anything, just to let everything load in. After I started doing this, never had an issue.
---
Just do the daily Dolly Sods quest and do campfire tails when it pops up. The my can reward possum badges. I’ve sold several backpack plans from it and never grinded a single badge.
---
Hey that’s awesome, congrats for you two. 
---
FO76 is the only game so far where I’ve randomly met someone that lives close by and started to hang out with.
---
Excellent, thank you. I never see Campfire tails spawn in, can I do this before completing Tadpole?
---
Gotta do tadpole first. They are easy. Do the athletic one, the revive one, and crossbow one. Way too easy
---
My ideas:
---
1. Festive grandma skin for all weapons
---
2. Atomic snowball throwing weapon
---
3. Snowman at camp
---
4. Randolph the Radstag
---
5. Santa Ghoul / RoboClaus / Santa Mole Miner
---
6. Frozen Parody
---
7. Snowmaker Cryolator skin
---
8. Radturkey
---
9. A very white whitespring
---
10. Santa's bag backpack
---
Yeah, I play solo so revive isn’t that great but I’ll just have to break down and buy a crossbow and cook a lot of food lol. Thanks!
---
I didn't take offense. It's a good thread; this dialogue is actually really positive and important to have. I think being able to talk about depression is never a bad thing. 
---
I think your post of staying active is really valid, but sometimes when you're in a bad way, turning your mind off is helpful. Being able to immerse yourself in something like vids is beneficial. But yes, it's a band aid and shouldn't be relied on too heavily. 
---
Different things work at different times for different people. But I liked that the original post is about reaching out.
---
I've had some dark moments be turned around simply from people reaching out to me.
---
Well as a preacher I dont want to start violence and I want to make sure people are helped in any ways. But I have a past that have taught me things and I will not have it called a tale of lies by anyone other then my maker.
---
If your on Xbox let me know. I’ll help ya. I can make a low level crossbow as well.  Best bet is to google where to find them. They are usually in need of repair.
---
There is a cap on revive experience, after doing it 6 times in a match you will not get any more experience from that, never heard about bans, not saying it never happened
---
Send me your GT! Next time I’m on I’ll look for you. Appreciate the help!
---
There's no such thing as a good shotgun build post demo nerf. However, my shotgun build still one shots most enemies like the majority of most end game builds. Just because shotguns dont perform like a bloodied commando build, doesn't mean you cant use them. OP was solely asking about shotgun builds, if they were interested in a different build I would have responded accordingly.

I 100% agree man especially reaching out part, i remember a ted talks where a guy with a really disturbing past was just about to shoot his school up only to stop just because a single guy said "how was your week". 
---
Interesting species we are.
---
I probably show offline but just send me a friend request
---
I agree an instigating full health build would be fun and hit pretty hard
---
It's called bladed, as if you can put it on anything, such as bladed combat knife, bladed drill, bladed sugar bombs.
---
Appreciate the karma but it doesn’t work on this sub
---
Well dang it lol thought that counts
---
Yea but this is like the worst lmao.
---
It’s the thought that counts lol
---
Just wanna say I just bought the game in hopes of doing the class war and eating the rich.  Can't find any though... Did Bethesda start hiding them?
---
Nuka nog too cuz why not!
---
I'll trade ya anything you want to help you get a backpack. I want junk. I have several smores recipes and ingredients.
---
I’ll keep that in mind, I bought s’mores knowing I’d need it and needing to burn caps, I’ll need to buy a sweet roll recipe for sure.
---
Oh my gosh congratulations! This is amazing! This world is a weird and crazy place. Its funny how things come together perfectly some times. And if the world goes to shit and we blow each other up, you'll have the perfect partner to survive with in the Wasteland
---
Tools are for peasants and hirelings. I never soil my manicured nails with manual labor. 🧐
---
"They trusted us, dumb fucks"
---
Awwww
---
A lot of the cooking recipes are sold from the robo chef in the whitesprings mall. If it's not there just server hop some.
---
I’ve tried a few times but always kept ending up with a stealth sniper.
---
This time I’m determined to do a pistol build...but at the moment my best gun is a freaking hunting rifle...and to stay alive I tend to have to stealth snipe  (no suppressor) to knock off 1 or two enemies at range...I just naturally fall into sniping in games and I’m good at it.
---
My original character was a stealth sniper but I changed him to a stealth commando...way over powered tbh.
---
I saw a sweet roll recipe in a vendor camp the other day but holy crap, they wanted a lot of caps, I’ll check WS for it. Appreciate that!
---
K
---
Defiantly need a fix to its hit detection, and a damage boost.
---
Yea a grapeshot mod and a heated/carcass mod that deals additional burn damage.
---
@ApocalypticAristocrat
---
What platform do you both play? Xbox? Want to join a clan?
---
Does instigating work with shotguns? I feel like I’ve heard that only the first pellet gets the effect.
---
I would say its an echo chamber that does not allow dissidence.  But is prolly what OP is looking for.  A hole for his head box.
---
Hope I meet my next wife on fallout. Congrats!
---
lol like this sub isn’t a echo chamber. Give yah head a shake 
---
Fallout first is the devil blah blah.
---
Obviously someone is creating these weapons... someone is creating the legendary effects, and someone is applying them to the weapon. In Fallout 4 you were able to create/remove mods and apply them to other weapons. We've pretty much got that, except in FO4, you received back the former mod when it is replaced by the current mod. This should still be doable.
---
What I propose is that this is extended to Legendary mods for LMSlot1, LMSlot2... I don't suggest we implement creating Legendary mods, as that would/could take too much time to implement, but, rather, you have to find Legendary weapons and remove the mods from them for use.
---
Here is a possible scheme for implementation:
---
	Removing a mod requires x amount of cobalt flux.
---
	Preparing a weapon slot to be used uses y amount of crimson flux (for weapons that have never had a Legendary mod applied to it.)
---
	Applying a mod requires z1 amount of violet flux, z2 amount of fluorescent flux, and z3 amount of yellowcake flux.
---
Tweak x,y,z? during development to get the desired difficulty...
---
Allow the mods to be sold/traded/whatever, it'll add more variety to the economy.
---
Reduce the frequency of 2\*, and 3\* Legendaries, will then require grinding to get the desired second and third slot fillers.
---
I’ve noticed a lag but they eventually appear.
---
Very low rof, weird projectile arc, limited range, just a very unused weapon
---
Also are you sur it's tse? Not just two shot? My understanding is it dose not drop explosive, like a grenade launcher or missile launcher. Since they are already an explovie weapon by themselves
---
Beautiful story. Congratulations to you both.
---
Exactly, would make life so much easier.
---
We are in a content gap. Mischief week ended and nothing replaced it. The only new thing is atomic shop updates.
---
Liberators drop them or sold by one of the whitespring vendors
---
I see the same people in Oceania all the damn time. Somehow I always get the same overpriced vendors instead of that one guy once selling 3*s for like 150 caps!

The hate here is real and organic.  Casuals was created to get away from that when they started fucking up the first dozen or so times with this game.

Be real about the game you are playing at least.  It shit and you like it.  That is ok.  Just be real about it and understand why everyone else is pissed off over and over and over and over.. etc etc again.

That one and the drum snare sound playing with each notification.

This is what I currently run on my shotgun build. Keep in mind each pellet from the shot gun shell synergizes well with four leaf. Every other shot will be a crit. I love running gun-fu with this build just my preference
---
I have a legacy shorties but my favie is my BE &amp; AAE combat. Tse pump is ehhh accuracy sucks, a suppressor and vats makes it doable though.

Unyielding- obi

Here is real for you.
---
It’s just a game- I think it’s a fun game. I do not take the game to seriously because it’s just a game. I do not take myself overly seriously in the game because I am just a guy playing I game I enjoy with cool people. 
---
That’s what the sub is for- people who don’t take the game of themselves overly seriously.. I mean it’s on the title page.
---
I never tested it, I dont see why not. If I ever got an instigating shotty I would prefer ffr over explosive.
---
Great. Now we got cheaters telling Bethesda what to do
---
Take everything in you can, you never know where a set of plans might be hiding. Stick to the areas that won't get you killed, you can work up to those as you level up. If you follow the  Overseer quest line, side quests will pop up as you go. Also, make notes, mental or on paper of what resources are in each area. That will help later.
---
I’m a cheater because I want a dev room item in game.. fuck outta here😂
---
Smash the main quests, then all the side missions
---
Check out the challenges section too
---
That’ll take you to random-ass places
---
As a tradition the quest will bring you almost everywhere. In this game it's the same but it doesn't bring you west in general, so if you want to wander around might wanna go that direction.
---
If you like creepy places, go to lucky hole mine.
---
I’ll try and find out if I ever get one
---
Didn't see you people asking Bethesda to add items from the dev room. Now that it got patched and weigh 160 pounds so that no one can use them, you are asking Bethesda to officially add them. Coincidence?
---
Being dismissive is an attempt at rationalization.
---
"its just a" is the biggest tell of such.
---
Just be honest with yourself.
---
I think the reason people wouldn’t consider the Tesla to op.. is it’s tiny mag size.. I think adding a heavy variant of this with a high mag capacity would not only be op, even with less dmg the ability to constantly shoot arcs 150+ times seems a bit over the top for me.. 
---
And also another note, adding a gun like this would significantly decrease the value of the quad Tesla, which is one of the best/ most valuable guns in game right now!
---
&gt; And on the final note.. Fuck the lore add the musket rifle!!!!!! We already have cryo/ tesla🤷‍♂️ 
---
I got one from some random. Works exactly like fallout 4. So they just need to add it to the loot lists.
---
Todd is both make and female, human and Godd. We are all gay for Todd on this blessed day.
---
I don’t know how I can be more honest lol. I love playing this game and I enjoy it almost everyday for at least a hour unless I’m working a bunch. 
---
I am ever so honestly excited for waste landers 
---
I am honestly love fallout first as well! 
---
*preps sale extractor*
---
You can keep saying “be honest with yourself”
---
But honestly- you don’t know me.
---
Yes, you would’ve been given it to someone who either exploited it from the dev room, or for it from someone else who did.. these guns are unobtainable now, but well I don’t see an realistic reason to keep them unobtainable..
---
Xbox, and I see the same people seemingly every day.  I shop at camps I visited yesterday; run into the same people almost every day.  It seems like the server you join isn't random; but tied to recent players or something.
---
That’s fantastic, thank you. What does L mean, though?
---
I love stories like these! Yay for gamer couples!! &lt;3
---
I met my husband on World of Warcraft and we've been together for 9 years (5 years married) now.
---
Congratulations and my best wishes to the both of you!
---
Yeah, some of us left. Sorry.
---
I was in the same situation until meat week. A rank 5 player with a bolt action pistol got mauled to death by a level 67 legendary death claw and a 67 yao guai. I felt bad but I moved in as soon as he hit the ground and got the revive off.
---
This is excellent!
---
I’m not an ass, I just wandered around and attempted to cover every inch of the map. I didn’t do any of the quests until i was 100+. Still haven’t done some of the quests yet.
---
I’ve tried, especially during Queen runs...my dumbass never has the Scout Uniform on when I’m not deliberately doing the scout quests lol I’m guessing that’s why none of mine have counted?
---
Do not think anyone doubts you like the game.   That is not it buddy. 
---
 You act like you can not understand why there is so much hate.
---
I understand where there is so much hate on this sub- it’s a echo chamber.
---
You mean the Zenimax board of directors needs to get paid. Ya know, Robert Trump and his buddies.
---
Does it feel good to be aboard the Trump train? Choo Choo make the wasteland great again
---
I’ve been using a 50 cal for awhile and finally went to Lucky Hole just the other day with my brand new Excavator armor. Holy crap! I’ll definitely be going back.
---
I'm "young" and have been in a relationship for almost 7 years. We actually went to Vegas and took a fake photo of us getting married to screw with our friends. We avoid the societal constructs of time and marriage. 
---
Time tells everything. I, personally, haven't made the move to marry this special someone because after all, we are STILL growing as individuals. We, together, are still learning and growing. We've discussed with each other that we aren't in any hurry. A piece of paper doesn't change or affect how we feel about each other. This post is just insight as to not rush things FYI. There is NEVER a reason to rush things ...unless your life has been deemed short for whatever reason. I would advise that you guys enjoy the little things together, the big things, live together for awhile, learn about each other, and then make a decision. 
---
Even if you weren't to postpone, hope you guys live happily together!
---
Would you like a list of all the deleted threads? Mods are working overtime removing the nonstop posts about NW hackers and fallout first complaints. It's getting disturbing how many threads get removed. I've made it a habit of mine to comment in every complaint thread so I can find it again once it's [removed].
---
If you play more than (x) amount of hours you are also not allowed to complain because you got your money's worth you greedy entitled gamer!
---
Just play it however you want. After I left the vault in the beginning, I didn't touch the main quest line for about 15 hours. Just explored and saw the sights and did side quests. Lots of unique places to go and cool stuff to explore :)
---
It’s always fun to laugh at the goofiness about the game on here but it’s also nice seeing posts like this.
---
Cool yes in curious on the results
---
That's incredibly dismissive of people with a genuine grievance.
---
I was a 1,000+ hour player who played daily until fallout 1st. I genuinely loved the game despite its flaws and foibles. 
---
I also am quite well paid, and the money itself wasn't an issue to me. What mattered was that I was lied to. I joined this game with the explicit understand that "everything would be free - no season pass". I paid a very hefty amount in presale. 
---
A little over a year later with the game still broken and in need of content, they completely betrayed their original promise and asked me to pay even more to have some of the main problems with the game fixed (limited storage, ability to transfer between characters, stable worlds).
---
Since that day, I stopped playing, because this is simply not a model I can or will support. If I have bought a product on the understanding that it will be a complete game, I expect that purchase to be honoured.
---
I simply cannot be party to being treated like that by a company.
---
I do miss the game, however I have now found many other entertaining, stable and content-heavy games that are entertaining me no-end.
---
But I still miss FO76 (hence why I am here, making this comment), but I simply can't come back. To accept this treatment is to encourage it. I will not do that. But to comment that the people complaining were a vocal minority who didn't play the game anyway is pure arrogance. The reason you're not hearing their voices any more is because they left, often broken-hearted. So indeed you're the one left in an echo chamber.
---
**TL;DR**: You can go screw yourself, you bumptious twat.
---
hopeless
---
Maybe Black Friday should be the event then, instead of Thanksgiving :-) - gangs of people PVP-ing at stations to get access to limited time, first-come-first-served deals from the vendors!
---
Don’t think many are playing for the awesome gameplay or story nowadays. Can’t think of a single other game with such a casual and mature community, it’s a nice change of pace from all the toxicity in all those other multiplayer games.
---
I'm happy for you!
---
Makes all the little and big things everyone is annoyed by in the game a lot less important. Cheers to the both of you 
---
And thanks for the tip. i guess i'll buy my father 7 copies of the game. Who knows after 15 years of no contact 😀
---
Use an aimbot. They are popular these days.
---
I am 45, my son is 13.  I've been gaming since I was his age; and playing games with him from day 1.  It was always our go to bonding thing, finished every Lego game together from Batman 1 to Avengers 2. He was well trained and at about 10-11 he started playing with friends on the usual games, Minecraft, Fortnite, etc.  I originally bought 76 on disc, but later bought it digitally so we could play together.  He is overwhelmed but also amazed by the game.  Sometimes I have to make him log on but others he's eager to learn more about the game/lore.  76 rocks if for no other reason that it can unite friends and family in a game that isn't just shooting at each other.
---
I hate Fallout 76 so much  but this is beautiful, congrats to you both! You brought a tear to my eye.
---
*places salt extractor*
---
It brought me closer to mine too
---
Nice.
---
But what happens when this game inevitably dies in the near future?
---
wow.
---
Anything you all do together in the game is an awesome bonding moment. My father is a year older than you and I’m 19 so we both get on talk about the game, life, friends, foe. And it makes my freakin day getting on and seeing that he’s playing.
---
Congratulations and celebrations🥳
---
Godd Howard is the one and only true sentient being who has ascended to God tier power
---
I very much agree. this game has one of the beat online communities that I’ve ever been apart of.
---
It’s not gay nor straight if it’s for Todd. Meet anybody of any sexuality, race, creed, sex, social status, and political opinion and then show them a picture of Todd Howard and ask if they would fuck him. 12/10 people will say yes.
---
What's really interesting is that she went through a supposed rough break up seemingly right before dating this guy. 
---
At least that's how her Instagram makes it seem.
---
Wedding rings fallout 1st exclusive marry your partner in game and while you both wear it ya get bonus exp.
---
I’m so sorry to hear that. I’ve also met some of my beat friends in the game. One lives in the same state as me and my father about 4 hours away so we are planning to meet up one day.
---
She was posting about going through a breakup in February so closer to 5-6
---
It's funny that you mention mirelurks because people have been complaining nonstop about how overpowered mirelurk kings are since they received a buff. Many people claim to want a challenge but cry like babies when their op unstoppable character actually runs into a tough enemy and dies.
---
Big oof, Im happy for them but that’s not healthy
---
I'd guess that your dad feels the same way.  Games in general are a great way to connect and 76 takes it to another level as there it so much freedom to explore, exchange ideas, etc.  Of course, it's just a game but it isn't the worst place to start to stay connected or reconnect.
---
They dated for 5 months…
---
They become pretty obsolete pretty quickly honestly. The only named weapon I still have after a year is the All Rise
---
Ah, one of the few good things to come out of the game. Congrats!
---
Idk why you’re downvoted because you’re right, they haven’t known each other long enough. Obviously we, as internet commentators, know little about their relationship, but objectively they’re moving too fast and have too little experience.
---
Ummmm that's not how bloody works. Bloody adds 5% damage for each 5% of your missing health, at 95%health it adds 5% damage. At 5% health it adds 95% damage. People usually sit at 20% health because that's when nerd rage kicks in, but you can get much more damage by going even lower.
---
Same here!
---
I proposed to my girlfriend after only 6 weeks. Now married 22 years. When you know, you know
---
Yes. 
---
Xbox One x,
---
Wired, ports forwarded, 100mbs
---
Got several freezes and DCs the last days. Even on 1st private worlds.
---
is that all that is left after brain is gone?
---
lol no I ended up grinding nuclear winter. but I want it for myself so it's gonna get done pretty soon
---
Why not just bring in the Tesla Cannon from Broken Steel?
---
I agree. We try to meet up IRL as much as possible but like I said we live a good ways away so it makes it a challenge.
---
Whoa now slow it down
---
While I admire the sentiment, this game and its creators CAUSES more depression for fans then it solves.
---
I think there would be more people like you than you know. It is awesome how a game can help maintain or form relationships.
---
In my case - I'm the father &amp; I play with my son.
---
He is young &amp; I still live with him, but I do work away for half the year &amp; although he doesn't play much when I'm away, it does give us something to talk about that we both enjoy. 
---
When I am home, he will always join my world, if its before dinner &amp; after he's happy just watching me if I'm playing. It's awesome &amp; he's becoming my little fallout 76 encyclopedia - as he forgets nothing &amp; reminds me what to do even though I'm 270 levels above him.
---
Legendary, lol. Super rare.
---
So, the accuracy of my claims can be easily tested by comparing appropriate guns. There's quite a few things in this game that people have little idea about, and I'm a Fallout lover thats also an awarded software tester - I'm a guy who once was paid a Bloodied explosive laser rifle for his description of what "in combat" means in this game.
---
When it comes to rating the perks, I meant that it's the only one 2nd star perk that is not explosive and that changes the base damage. Fire rate increases the DPS, 50% Crit damage does not touch base damage at all, and 10% while aiming indoubtedly is the 2nd greatest base damage increase. There are certain weapons where I think 10% while aiming is the best possible perk, but there are other weapons where I know it's not. It's also much better than the 50% bonus crit damage simply because increase in base damage means increase in critical hit damage, so it could say "gives 10% to your base damage and 30% to your crit damage" and it would be much more appropriate than the false statement that is presented on those weapons right now.
---
She's 23, she knows what she wants

I met my (now) wife in May 2013. She moved in with me August 2013, and we married September 2014.
---
Sometimes it moves fast because people rush. But sometimes it moves fast because people know.
---
I've been running a stealth build since game release. The more people in an event, the less likely baddies will find you out.
---
Don't think of them as other players, they are your decoys so you can do what you need to.
---
I have no data to honestly answer your question.
---
Myself I am betting on "it stays as it is" and I traded a Bloodied Explosive handmade for my Bloodied 10%Aiming one.
---
Had legendary enemies disappear a few times today and I had to go on an expedition to find their bodies at their spawn points, not great but it’s been a reliable fallback for when they disappear.
---
the only valid criticism comes from people who purchased the product and requested a refund within 48 hours (2hrs playtime max).
---
any other criticism is invalid.
---
enjoying previous fallout titles doesnt permit you to criticise changes in development or monetization of future fallout titles.
---
Thanks for the love everyone, I hope everyone finds their one and only, it's best when you least expect it.
---
I have my camp in flatwoods and always had a vending machine labeled “noobs” with free stuff. I too noticed that the higher levels would take it all! Kinda made me sad lol
---
Well I'll admit that's the first time I've heard that
---
Good man, I have aspergers and I find it difficult to connect with people sometimes, My posts or comments may come off as douchey or unkind, but I really want what's best for everyone and a game I can't pull myself away from and just get lost in. It urks me when I can't find common ground with the people of this sub who more than likely care for this game the way I do. I want everyone to have fun and get lost in this shit the way I do, good medicine for all. I never mean to offend with my opinions, but when something I love turns into something I don't recognize, expect me to go the fuck off, I really do mean well tho.
---
You can add me then, my psn is Beccakim :D
---
If you get the Can-Do perk in luck and dig in all the trash cans at Whitespring once a day you'll have enough preserved food to keep you going for ages, or sell it in a vendor.
---
I run a restaurant and get a damn good profit from selling prewar food to players
---
Without this i have no purpose to hop into other than selling scripts,throw them away for some crap and then the cycle repeats, altho i did enjoy leveling up my other toon during the halloween since low lvl have many other things to do during the event..
---
It’s hard to imagine that an actual majority have gone the Fallout 1st way. I know a lot of people are uninterested in (or ignorant of) the way BSG have gone back over their initial promises of free (new) content but it is surprising...
---
It did feel like it.
---
However it did serve me very well, it was my main weapon for a couple of months.
---
I’m not a melee guy but I still carry it everywhere bc I carry TSE and I got tired of blowing myself up in close combat lmao
---
😭
---
It's been happening since day one, happened a few times to me but not that frequently. I'm sure there is some trigger that causes the issue but regardless, it's been an issue for a long time and yet to be fixed. Just add it to the pile I guess
---
I was about 3k away from max and someone bought my blue asylum set and missed out 4k caps :/
---
Well, RIP firestorm, but you can't upgrade them in level and firestorm is lvl 15 or so right?
---
Congrats. May the future remain bright for you.
---
Darn, I was hoping that really wasn't the case. The atom challenges are one of the few things keeping me going right now.
---
You are right.  90% weight reduction not explosive.  Over 800 pts damage and chance to hit twice.
---
It is a shitty design. I’ve lost a good 40k since vendors were introduced.
---
I’d say that hopefully they’ll fix it soon but it’s Bethesda. If anything they’ll make it worse.
---
Congratulations! But I have a suspicion, when (if) you fight, do you nuke each others camp?
---
Good for you, i wish you a merry marriage! Hope i'll meet someone too.
---
Power armor is groooossssss.
---
There is no plan for commie whacker, only for mod for it (Bladed Commie Whacker). "Weapon" you can get in the amusement park.
---
That's a thought. I log into adventure almost exclusively, but tonight I played on NW first, so I'll make sure not to do that going forward. I hadn't logged into NW for months before this happened the first time though, so not completely consistent.
---
No worries, it was happening to me pretty frequently but support are pretty decent and after an email or two they credited my account. I had a few weeks of logging in to all my weekly and quite often 1-3 dailies automatically completing . . . . Did that for 2-3 weeks then it stopped and went back to normal.
---
My Skull Bandana acts as a mask for toxic environment protection, without any pesky Perception loss.
---
Hey man when you know you know. My parents got married after three months of dating and they're the most wonderful well adjusted couple I could ever hope to meet
---
That makes no sense compared to gas masks
---
It was the same when "sole Survivor" first dropped in Survival mode, it's a LAR but couldn't take the skin. They got around to fixing it.
---
You can't build NW items for others anymore.
---
Whether something drops as level 45 or level 50 depends solely on the item type because all weapons and armors go up in 10-level increments, so they are either 5/15/25/35/45 or 10/20/30/40/50. And that has only incidentally to do with how good they are. Handmade and lever action rifles only go up to level 45 and are still some of the best rifles in the game, for example.
---
Also, there are on the order of 20 1st tier and 5-10 each 2nd and 3rd tier legendary effects, and only a few of those are good for any given weapon or build, let alone any given combination of legendary effects. So the vast majority of legendary drops are unavoidably scrip crap, and nothing is going to change about this unless Bethesda sees fit to overhaul the whole system (which I don't see them doing, sadly).
---
That said, yes, event rewards are often a bit on the underwhelming side. I don't need another White Wolf Fedora, TYVM.
---
By the way, increasing Charisma only increases your caps rewards, Intelligence increases your XP, and Luck increases the condition of dropped gear. Other than that, stats don't have any influence on what you get.
---
Always wanted to find one. Never have
---
This is just so lovely, congratulations to you both!
---
The most efficient way is to win matches instead of being a speedbump on someone else's way to victory. Have fun with it! Hiding in a bush is incredibly obvious, and about as fun as watching paint dry.
---
At least something good came out of this game.
---
That's blatantly wrong. Unequip and reequip your weapon to see the updated damage numbers at different health, use the addon "improved health bars" if you need help seeing your exact health percentage. The numbers go up exactly at 94%, 89%, all the way down to 4%.
---
Besides bloodied weapons, the mutation "adrenal reaction" works the same way, starting at 49% health.
---
Congrats hope u two are happy👍👍
---
I have a camp at which people have to drop through a hole in the floor (hidden in a cupboard) to access the spooky hidden dungeon that also houses my vendors. It is windowless so they have no clue what is down there. I had worried many people would think it was a trap and run a mile but it's great that 99.9% actually jump! Like me, I think most people are eager to experience something a bit unexpected.
---
The X-01 Power Armor just reached late prototype stage at this point in the timeline. You're a few hundred years too early to be asking for X-02.
---
It would be great if Bethesda would implement a feature were you could set the vending machines to only let people at a level of your choosing to buy from it.
---
Congratulations :) That's adorable!
---
I put out a candy bowl full of goodies and a level 175 ran up and ate all of it then left.
---
The amount of people who have Fallout 1st in game is significant. The amount of players who complain about it is almost non-existent.
---
The reverse is true on Reddit. The populations are not the same.
---
Yes, paying extra to get the end game content to work properly is a great idea.....
---
You don't need to be wearing the uniform, I've never worn it and I've got the possum backpacks with high capacity, armour plated and insulated mods plus 12 badges currently.  Dolly sods and toxic valley scout quests are your friends
---
Uhm... they are about to go on vacation for the holidays likey they normally do. They won't be back in the office until January.
---
Yes
---
Really? I feel like my revives haven’t ever counted?! Who knows, the grind is insane for a damn backpack lol but at a certain level you run out of things to do, so here I am...thanks for the tips. I ran Dolly Sods bug quest to get it out of the way, did the clean up in Toxic Valley...now I’m stuck with taking pictures of things that want to kill me and swimming lol
---
Congatulations, may it be a long, happy marriage :)
---
Maybe they are all nuking on their private servers with their buddies
---
New content is already out.
---
I dunno, I play with a large discord server and most of the chat on there is the same as reddit, people are angry about fallout first but it only takes 1 person out of every 8 to get everyone into a private server so I'm seeing almost everyone on my friends list in or visiting a private world. People aren't turning down the benefits of using a private world and a lot of people wanted the outfit so they bought 1 month. I'm curious to see how many people go for a second month.
---
Paid full price for a digital copy at release, then paid $10 for a hard copy from a Redbox movie rental machine for my alt account.
---
Risky link of the day
---
Where YOU spawn is different from where your visitors spawn. One is based on your CAMP unit. Experiment a bit.
---
You had unlimited storage capacity in the older games, so you would loot more in those.
---
lol, good to see someone bet my 1,6k xD
---
I've got an instigating combat shotgun, head shots to lvl 68 mutants and lvl 62 ghouls and scorched are generally one shot kills.  Accuracy is it Achilles heel though.
---
Place the vending machines in a 'room' that you can lock up.
---
When you want to stop selling for whatever reason just lock the room (and power down the machines so people don't fast travel to your CAMP only to be greeted by a locked door).
---
Yes, people who don't play the game bitch about fallout first. 
---
I'm adding that my discord group, which is all active players, also bitch about fallout first and only a minority of the dozens of people I play with have purchased fallout first. Of the people who did buy it, most have only purchased a single month to try it out and see what exactly they get in terms of discounted items from the atomic shop. Those people were already spending more than $13 a month in the shop so it indeed is a good deal for some, but I still consider them a minority of the active players and I expect even less of them to renew a second month.
---
I'm dreaming of a Whitespring Christmas
---
They continue on with their lives? Why what will you do?
---
Worth pointing out that they said all DLC and 'post launch stuff' would be free, but there would be items in the Atom Shop that would cost Atoms. QoL content isn't DLC so it'd be easy enough to disagree that it was a 'filthy lie.' 
---
I'd genuinely suggest you don't buy video games on a promise of what they could be. Either buy them for what they are right now, or wait and buy them when and if that promise is fulfilled, and to make sure you're not filling in the blanks yourself of what that promise is.
---
While i am glad for you two, it feels weird and really rushed when i hear 2 people getting married within months of knowing eachother.
---
&gt;*users should not take ore samples out of their jars, for they tend to flake and crumble and you would run the risk of having radioactive ore spread out in your laboratory.*
---
Ah, the good old 1950s.
---
That can't be right. Do you have Adrenal Reaction? That mutation doesn't stop adding damage at 20% either. You should definitely see more damage at 14%, 9%, and 4%.
---
I was on quite a few servers where Mischief night was nuked...now that’s timing
---
Yeah this could very well be. My friend gave me the chair this summer and it could have been patched.
---
True enough
---
That's fair.
---
Bethesda is going to need to make Fallout 1st attractive for as long as they want the money to keep coming in. People won't stay subscribed more than a month at a time otherwise.
---
You can transfer between characters, The server resets after 5 minutes. I drop things in a suitcase or other container and relog with an alt or mule then pick it up
---
It is still a chassis when I place it and get it though
---
on xbox i get account logged in on another divice to an unknown error has occurred.
---
mischief week, new private servers. I dont know about a lot of other high levels but I had to test myself vs the queen solo. then I got addicted because when you kill the queen and all the adds you get ALOT of legendaries. Then the thought popped into my head about fighting in the radiation zone and getting all that sweet sweet high radiation fluid, Then I thought instead of killing the queen early in the radiation zone, I should see how long I could stretch it to get the most fluid mass and legendaries in one event.After a few days of that  I finally ran completely out of radaway and just started playing normally again. launched 4 nukes yesterday on private servers but that was day time east coast. I consider myself the average gamer in most regards so if I went through that cycle probably a lot of others did too. it should pick back up soon :)
---
Yes, I have both. The damage and my Unyielding boosts also peak at 20%.
---
The damage on my gun jumps up to 285 only when it is unequipped and then equipped.
---
They're gonna need more than a few double xp weekends at this point. No new content coming till wastelanders which could be as late as March ain't great. Things already getting a bit stale in terms of in game content.  We need more to do in game, especially for endgame players if they want to retain players.  Or fix the raid rewards so it's worth the grind for vault steel maybe!
---
It didn't work at launch, and it won't work now. While they stay quiet, players and gaming media alike tear them apart. If Wastelanders is a failure, this game is finally done.
---
I wouldn't drop things and expect them to be there when you relog. 
---
Use a trusted friend or mule to transfer valuable gear.
---
I won't get back even if every day would would be double XP.   
---
Bethesda has shown they only care about money and to make sure they won't go same route with TES6 and their other games, we all should get back to better ones to make sure they see we don't approve what they do. Like when Fallout first came out, even I bought it despite the fact I haven't played since NW was relased. Game addicts amd hardcore fallout fans keep supporting the game no matter what and that's all Bethesda needs to keep going. 10000 subscriptions for F1st is good enough reason to keep going on. Adding P2W elements? Why not because only few people gets mad and they still keep getting ton of money. We have to tell Bethesda what they are doing is wrong and we don't want it. If we want to save future game that Bethesda probably will make, like TES6 for not being same disaster as Fo76, we have to stop playing!   
---
I suggest games like Fo3 or New Vegas. And hey, I hear Outer worlds is pretty good.
---
You're a putz, pal, no better than any other. Get the hell over yourself.
---
the  higher level players are more seasoned and understand that clearing out the vendor if its free is the smart thing to do
---
I see nukes every day.
---
Pharafarmers wet dream right there. I go there all the time for those LOL
---
rando  "wtf is a level 363 doing in morgan town ?"

---
I just used that damage calculator online, and it concurs with what you're saying. However, that's not what is happening for either of my characters in-game.
---
Sure, im up for it
---
Don't use the paperbag method, it will become unresponsive. Use a world container to mule items between your characters. You have around 5 minutes till "your" server resets
---
Oh you're "allowed".  But why would anyone listen to criticism from someone who doesn't know what they're talking about.
---
Sounds to me like they shouldn't be in your group. Just saying.
---
I successfully transfered things to one lowbie alt but then later I tried and the bag was empty. it displayed a bag but nothing was in it. so that makes me thing beth is pulling some shenanigans to stop our shenaningans. havent tested since so that may have been a one time fluke. I definately recommend what looch says though. after I lost the first care package I just wait till the wife logs in and have her give it to my alts now. its all good it was for science mostly anyway.
---
No, only a jerk does this, at any level.
---
I carry a b/e hunting rifle and a b/e fixer. I don’t really like lever guns because of the lack of a perforating magazine option. A lot of people get turned off hunting rifles, but they are bonkers for one hit kills.  Trust me, I know my way around a min/max bloody sniper build.
---
Possibly just a pip-boy display glitch, I'm not at my computer right now so I can't test at the moment.
---
nope I got boned that way already. went to go buy the next serum recipe and a whale emptied my shop out while I was on the way down to the science wing lost about 10 k. Days of hardly no sales and my most treasured type of customer showed up at the worst possible time. now once I get over 16 k and I want to go buy the next recipe I store the vendors with the high end stuff. it sucks but its a lot easier to restock than refarm.
---
I dont join him when it's just us on but he will join if some of the others in our group are on. A friend of a friend kind of thing. I think he's getting better than he first was so maybe he's learning not to be such a poor sport.
---
I also get random completions of dailies from stuff across the map I am no where near from time to time. "uhm thanks beth"
---
I agree with most of that except thst it's more broken than at launch I remember what it was like back then at to be fair I haven't had any issues for months oh actually I got kicked out once while playing mischief night
---
Nice! I have three traps on my three characters camps, all where you fall off a cliff with a floor missing in front of a vender but I have confetti covering the hole so it looks normal. With the cannibal perk when they fall to their knees press square to execute and have a free feed with no rads or disease lol over 200+ kills. I haven't seen any other out there so we must be a rare breed of toxic lol
---
lol thats fucked up but also funny. I would be a clanker. I am always in x-01 when I shop just because of trap vendors.
---
Fish are dead in Fallout world
---
but do you also have friends outside fallout 76
---
Barely😂
---
Turn off power and build a wall around your vendors? Could be a solution but I get it it’s a lot of effort to go through
---
You killing the wrong things for acid go to top of tangara tien and get them cave crickets
---
Lol my one weakness

Ah, typical reaction from the lower class.

That’s alright. We won’t hold your anger toward the Establishment against you.

Yeah, I loved the voice lines. We might be able to scour the game files for them.

The game needs to die. Is a fucking XP boost all you need to keep playing broken game made by greedy fucks?
---
r/iamverysmart
---
Dude dont bother arguging with that moron. He would succ on Beth titties if he could.
---
I did something similar just when player vending was new, with very similar results. Of course, not all high levels, but many, would clear out the machines. Newbies was more careful and only took a few items.
---
I guess the high levels are used to loot everything in their path. Or something.
---
I have the US army military open camp style going. or that would work just fine sir. I am near thunder mountain  and have a water farm going. I could not for the life of me get a house to look decent and still stay in budget because the spawn demnds turrets and ind water purifiers are expensive. so I only have 6 foundations total with an army tent some military cots and ammo , army foot lockers etc for deco. it looks like a small army camp and has all the crafting stuff etc as well. I could make the walls work most likely but I really like the look. so in my case I just store the vendor.
---
totally pictured wile e coyote with knife and fork and road runner dropping in front of him with x-01 lol.
---
meep meep zoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooom
---
I don't think that's true. I have both those over 10 and my drops aren't great either.
---
But how do you do like the new Ranger skin?
---
This happened to me today as well - I logged in after a few days of not playing and 4 of my weekly challenges and 2 of my daily challenges were auto-completed. Didn't log into NW at all, they showed up as completed upon logging into Adventure Mode.
---
I did have the NW Glowing Skeleton challenge highlighted so I don't know if there's any connection there - I do know I'm hella salty for losing out on 120 atoms though 😠
---
Have you opened a ticket for their support or just moaned here?
---
They will pay them with free Atoms.
---
are you on ps4? people dont wanna be friends with me
---
surely not all high levels. out of the high levels that visited you shop how many didnt take it. I for one wouldnt. most of my friends wouldnt. 
---
also on the low levels not taking when I make a lowbie I am often trying an experiment of some sort. I dont like taking help because I know chances are I will try the thing and I will end up deleting that character. generally when i start a lowbie alt he has a care package of 1-15 weapons 1 5 10 armor and 100 or so bottled water. 
---
My main is level 363 ish. he did NOT have a smooth playthrough. first he was a sniper then a stealth sniper then a power armor sniper then finished up now as a junkie heavy gunner in power armor. 
---
when I push alts that arent heavy gunners I tend to play them till I run into a fatal flaw in the leveling up process. then ill delete and when I am feeling "alty" I'll start fresh with a new idea.
---
A good friend of mine met his wife of 2 years 5 or so years ago playing Eve Online. Congrats, it can happen. Hope it lasts and hope you two are happy forever.
---
"We're not planning on doing anything about it"
---
Well no, like many here I've played a great deal (Level 195) and I object strongly. I've played since release and I actually stopped playing at Patch 14. It might mean nothing to BGS but there it is.
---
Hahahaha
---
i made a red rocket garage replica across from the over seers tent during the free trial period when we had all the new players. stocked it up for noobies and most of them didnt even check it because they were literally to new to know what a vendor was and then a high level cleared me out. I expected the latter but all the newbies ignoring the place I did not expect. starter armor free brotherhood level 1 5 and 10s free .308 melee weps pistols all the major wep groups.
---
I have been doing it at ws station, the suitcase in the tent. So i know they work
---
It seems really immature and unhealthy, and seems to speak volumes to their experience in the dating world. 
---
Like you said, we only know so much.. but damn
---
hmm I was thinking of that lady in the budget fallout shelters "nuclyooler protection on a budget" looking at the title.
---
Nice try Bethesda. Your writing skills are getting better
---
Dumb. Ass. Loser. Try to comprehend. You are an asshole for promoting a class war in a game that literally has WORK TOGETHER OR PERISH SEPARATELY baked into the plot. You aren't doing anything with your idiotic commentary beyond making yourself look like a big dumb jerk. Nobody gives a flying **** that you've deluded yourself into thinking you're something special.  Sorry Gertrude, you're just a schmuck. Enjoy your block - I don't need to ever see anything from you again. Have a crappy life.
---
Yeah, several. But once I've blocked them, their Camps no longer show up on my map .)
---
Here was my method for surviving long into each round. I knocked out 14k experience in around 7/8 hours play time, with winning around 5 or 6 of the matches. Spawn in Morgantown at the wrecked apartment building in the center of town. If you place your dot just right in the gray of the building itself in the map, you can actually spawn in the building, with roughly a 40/60 chance of spawning right on an orange crate. Head up to through the apartment until you reach the roof with the fire escape (2nd floor, opposite side from the monorail entrance) then climb the fire escape. At the top of the fire escape is a gate, open that and then drop your camp close by, but not in the way of the gate. You can build a foundation right outside the gate, play around with the foundation until it turns green, and then build 3 stairs going up to the very top roof of the apartment. You can use Frog Legs to jump up to this spot. Once you're up there, move your camp and hide inbetween some pipes and the big AC unit, and you can't be seen from any angle unless they're sniping from the top of the Morgantown Airport Tower. You can also do this to get on top of Vault Tec University and hide up there as well. 
---
What's nice about this method is the central location, height advantage, and the abundance of loot in the apartment. Best case scenario, you'll have 2 terminals, 2/4 safes, a power armor spawn, and two orange crates amongst tons of lesser loot. 
---
If you need to leave the safety of the roof, just remember to play the storm and take your time going from cover to cover (bush to bush). "Play it like the Hunger Games." as a friend of mine says. Also, use Photomode and play with the Zoom Distance, it's like playing as a surveillance camera if you need to stay still or lie low. You can do this even if you decide the swimming method of surviving (Aquaboy perk and hide in the toxic lake or Bolton Green swimming pool) as long as you're close enough to the surface. 
---
If you're on Xbox, I can show you the spot and method. Gt is: Oliver Klohzof
---
This isn't wreck it ralph.
---
Play if you want to.  I mean, I play almost daily despite how others feel about the game.  
---
Beware the internet is filled with rumor &amp; toxicity.
---
I wish you were on Xbox. I love this game but it actually causes my depression to get worse.
---
I'm depressed mainly because of people. I want less of them in my life, not more.
---
congrats! I got my wife the Fallout cookbook and she loves it.
---
Wish you the best ! Some of my best friends IRL were met online, I can understand you.  
---
On a side note : good choice, your first dance song, very classy !
---
Killzone Huh? Did PS2 have a functional social system in any way?
---
Excellent ideas
---
I have been playing since beta. it pisses me off sometimes. yet I keep logging in rather than going off to other games. which makes it the game for me. I cannot logically define why its my preferred world to log into but it is what it is. 
---
 you deleted it which indicates it may not be the game for you.
---
yet you're here which indicates you still have an interest. which means it may indeed be the game for you. 
---
NW is full of hackers according to rumor. Adventure mode is devoid of pvp especially since private servers came out. pretty much as a firster I go to my server take all three shops and the ammo factory and stuck up on ammo for the week. not many peeps seem to claim shops any more. in my case I only claim them on servers now to waste pvpers time. If I get the fusion cores thats nice but if a ganker takes it I just deny him his fight and smile and wave. I mean I got hundreds of cores now and I know he just spent over 100 cps taking the spot. I feel bad for them sometimes. standing there completely non stealthed all lonesome looking wanting me to come in and shoot them lol.
---
Whatever reason you deleted it for before, I don't think that reason has changed enough to warrant you coming back.
---
You have a feeling to play, so play.. then you will either like it and continue playing or won’t like it and stop. Don’t base your game playing decisions on what other people say or think, see for yourself.
---
I had this issue all night last night. I eventually just logged out of the server and it worked fine in a new one.
---
Make the new account first before transferring items. Would recommend you do it with a world container at a train station or something (make sure both accounts are at the station already)
---
Would also recommend you dont do that at all and instead use some other person you trust to move the items for you. There is a market subreddit that has dedicated people for that. 
---
The couriers there have been trusted with much larger and higher value trades (entire sets of the best armour's and God roll weapons at a time).
---
More than a couple times. How estly doesn't bother me too much, if I'm not paying attention to where I'm going, I deserve it.
---
They are single use so that’s a tough question.
---
I'm never coming back,never coming back. Never coming back, never ever coming ba-ackk.
---
Zmoneymax and Greedthesda could both suckle on my tip whilst tongueing my taint, even distribute some rim jobbing.
---
Now the number 76 makes me nauseous. The Outer Worlds is pretty ok. It's a really nice game to play after that which shall not be named, because you can legit turn it on, play, have some fun, do some quests, level up, explore a little, create a character build that suits you, use dialogue to talk to npcs etc. And, get this, the game won't crash. I know, I couldn't believe it either. Also, there's no glitches or bugs or anything like that! It's seriously like obsidian play tested their product to an acceptable standard before releasing it! Amazing! First I was thinking I might’ve been playing it wrong, but it turns out this is actually rather common among MOST game developers! 
---
I'm just so blown away.
---
TLDR; Zenimax and Bethesda are Scrooge Mcduck.
---
The whole game needs a balance pass. It isn't just a PA issue. 
---
Issue for me is that there is no clear niche for PA except for farming nuked zones or other highly irradiated areas.
---
I'd really like to see PA be slower but tankier and have the option to better handle heavier weapons as is (even without all the heavy perks). Something unique to it that can't be mimicked with non-PA options but at the same time not entirely essential either. Just different.
---
I don't agree with the carry weight thing unless it comes with serious trade-offs. Much like the Excavator vs the other variants, you sacrifice combat ability for carry capacity. It shouldn't be clearly better than regular armour in this category as backpacks made scrapper types absolutely not need PA to make it viable.
---
Do tents have their own icon?  I didn’t think to look yet.
---
My sights are setti on resetti.
---
honestly as an avid power armor user I think making it any stronger would make it too strong. 
---
1. jetpacks + marsupial + birdbones = the best mobility in the game. period. 
---
2. for non strength builds calibrated shocks gives you very very good carry capacity. 
---
3. x-01 + fireproof + blocker + bulletproof (for heavy gunners)  means you can solo rape the queen and all her minions if you have enough dps in your build.
---
4. by using power armor you can avoid spending a lot of your perks so you have room for a lot of utility perks and different type gameplay. ie my wife is always running 3 lockpicker cards 3 hacking cards through hiker and she is able to kill the queen as well. 
---
5. power armor saves a lot of weight and inventory clutter. when I go to the apparel section at the vendor I only have to avoid accidently selling one outfit. maybe a hat if I am feeling like a hat in that play session. 
---
Granted power armor sucks for pvp. theres only a build maybe 2 that stand a chance  anything else you are just done for. but with the mobility and the cliffs and the tall buildings etc I dont see how people enjoy this game without jetpacks. 
---
the only thing about power armor that annoys me is the getting in and out to craft / sleep. I avoid that by eating melons to avoid cooking. I farm fusion cores for ammo, I am already extremely high level so exp bonuses dont really help me. I use the repair kits from the queen to repair my weapons and armor. basically the only time I get out of my power armor is when I want to. never because I have to. if you like to craft and cook and stuff PA can be annoying AF I imagine.
---
This is my main hope for PvP. I image a certain zone, no bigger than a nuke zone, that has a few daily  faction quests, and inside that zone anyone not on your faction is hostile and can be killed on sight. After a certain number of kills per faction - say a raider kills a settler 10 times - the zone for a short time is then considered a raider zone and a few raider specific vendors or events could happen over the course of an hour or 2, same as a nuke zone. It would be a fun way to open up people to PvP without them having total meltdowns about being killed, I think.
---
Why? Or do you mean Emote, which there already is
---
Maybe it is meant to be something special for the people who are really into NW. They want nice things too.
---
Atleast something good came from the game
---
Some people Run autofixers/combatrifles in .38 afaik..
---
If there is a itv today
---
Funny how they only do videos on the bad stuff... for exemple they did a video on the 500 atoms skin.... but the next day instead of correcting the video saying it has been a mistake and i s now free they publish something else negative... well Master Race problems.
---
Don’t drop a bag. On a private world, put the items into any world container instead. I’ve been leveling a new character so my primary makes him new armor and weapons every 5 levels. I put them in a desk or suitcase with the primary, log out, log in with the new alt, pick them up. Have done this without fail several times.
---
There will be, I just feel they have absolutly nothing new to show up and they will have a bad time posting each week, I think we will see alot more ITV like last weeks...
---
Maybe they don't want to set the world on fire?  
---
More fun if they do though.  
---
[](/sunsetsneaky)
---
Diminishing returns. 
---
That would reduce it to 32.7% IIRC. Combined with Travelling Pharmacy it’s 96.73% reduction.
---
When does the ItV usually post?
---
You can cripple multiple enemies with the limb damage legendary effect.
---
Add me if you’re on PS4 haha
---
In about 4-6 hours from now.
---
Oh, you must've wanted the block as well. Happy to oblige, see you never.
---
Can't blame us after the krill started picking fights with the whales.
---
I dont think we will have any info on wastelander until February... Im actually more inclined to think wastelanders will be released at the end of March.... Why say Q1 if you are releasing in January? Just say you pushed a month... Q1 is so vague it leads me to beleive they were way way late on Wastelanders develpment.
---
I think there will be a patch 15 maybe by mid December, I think they might add gift boxes (post boxes) as part of a Xmas event, Im expecting complete silence until end of November or early December. I just loggin to talk to my friends now... I just dont feel like doing anything... They wait is really really testing me...
---
There is a chance they missed the "new players sticker" I don't always read the signage on machines. 
---
That said I'll leave free aid items alone because I feel other players need them more than I do.
---
Nope far harbor were full of them.
---
Just don’t use the bag, items inside despawn if there is no player nearby.
---
Place a doorway but when you don't want in the room convert the doorway into a wall so no assholes can lockpick it.
---
I’ve kill hundreds of people in traps :) I have only ever got one angry message, it said “I’ve got your number bud” haha. I never take peoples junk tho, it’s really not even worth it and any good trap will cost a ton of materials :)

https://youtu.be/LTLOIXOsaF0
---
This is my newest video but I have two that I’m filming now :) on all but one of my characters I build traps that you set off yourself but as long as the trap is a nice high quality build ppl don’t get mad :)

---
When I get close to 30k caps I either gift 5k to a friend or the lowest level on the server, or I buy some rare clothing item I don't yet own. There is a market sub to find just about anything at any time.
---
I'd give it a go, and I'm not into PvP.
---
Been on last weekend and ppl  dropped like 3 nukes in a row for the SBQ
---
More PvP events like The Battle that Never was and Race for the Presidency are also already in the game files planned to activate at some point in the future.
---
I hope they eventually add more and make them public, running on a parallel timer distinct from pve events.
---
Congratulations! This is a very inspiring story. I hope you two live long and happy lives :]

---
This would be ideal, but unless both parties have to initiate the hostility switch or people would never, ever go for this lol. People hate pvp in this game *sooooo* much so many people would quit, not join a faction, or play private 100% of the time. I knew I'd get downvoted for mentioning PvP outside of a designated zone based on the fact I've been called some horrible names for initiating PvP in workshops, a perfectly acceptable aspect of the game.
---
The real truth if this is rushed lol
---
&gt;Just look at the Blizzard ban fiasco. The president of Blizzard apologised twice - for the second time even on Blizzcon where he even didn't have to do it.
---
please do tell what did they apologize for? they never ONCE addressed the issue they were apologizing for, they literally just said "we're sorry" (basically: "we're sorry this gained so much traction with the community/media") and that was it 
---
but they did go onto chinese social network and apologize to the chinese users lmao
---
keep sucking that bethesda/blizzard corporate dick - multibillion companies dont need you defending them
---
People that happen to walk by can still purchase from the machines.
---
Or that.
---
Wait hasn't 76 not even been out a year? You're marrying someone you've only known a matter of months?
---
In my opinion best armor combo is all heavy with BOS combat chest and leather limbs. Throw on the lead lined backpack and you got legendary power armor haha
---
Fucking children!! SMH look up how much divorce is at least
---
Knowing each other for less than one year and getting married? Brave.
---
I agree on everything, although Legendary power armor should have power armor related benefits like decreased core consumption or jetpack uses less AP, and others, not just regular armor modifiers.
---
There's a lot of fast decision relationships these days, and surprisingly, a lot of them work out.
---
companies dont deserve money for shit products
---
Nice song choice
---
There's a ton of unused space at the southeast end of the map of the Spruce Knob. Who ever goes there? That would be a perfect area out of everyone's way.
---
Oh yeah both parties would have to initiate hostility obviously haha you can’t just go around killing people when you do. It’s for anyone who has activated hostility will be hostile with others who also have and are part of a different faction
---
Why the hell are there so many downvotes on this comment? It's a wholesome comment!
---
This would be great
---
"Don't worry u/erinnswaby, we'll do it for free. As long as you buy Skyrim!"
---
Yep, 1st year with my ex was like this.  Then after the honeymoon phase ended, we discovered incompatibilities that made us become good friends instead. We still talk every now and then but We’re not interested in each other.
---
Thats awesome
---
The musket doesn't need to fuck up the lore. Placing it in Prickett's fort, perhaps on the corpse of a civil war reenactor, would place it perfectly within the continuum without even writing a single note or terminal entry.
---
This could actually work usually faction imbalance kills PvP in most online games but since the servers are not persistent and only hold a small number of players it would be easy to balance, I like this idea.
---
I have a heavy gunner and enjoy the fact I can use them without power armor but there's just absolutely no way anyone should be able to hold most of the heavy guns. It would make sense to require PA to wield them.
---
We both just got elder scrolls online...does that count..
---
Dude, you can drop the nuke yourself! Don’t count on other players to play the game for you. ;)
---
And the ones who bought 1st and are still enjoying the game has gone to other subreddits as well
---
Bye homo

Ok you win

He's just poking fun/RP'ing. As if using the monocle emoji wasn't clear enough...

Player: I dislike the game.

Anonym1230: You must not own the game then.

That's some logic right there, I wish I was paid to defend a game that's worth less than 500 atom.
---
Am I tripping balls or Juicehead used a screen from my ranger outfit mod from nexus as a preview? :D
---
I know what the question was about, and it was already answered, I only wanted to point out that it may be more practical to give up a small amount of DR when the ER can be nearly doubled by changing just one piece of armor. Again, I do not know what the OP needs this set for.
---
thats nice i have a whole dedicated nuka cola section of my camp
---
cheers m8
---
Haha, yes, that's the other, unspoken side of the PSA - anyone who might *like* that effect, it's happening whether or not it should lol.
---
Everybody seems to be experiencing this. I still like the game a lot but it's totally overshadowed by this. I play with a group of hardcore players but I see less and less of them each day.
---
Cause they be talking about it all the time
---
mischief night would be my guess. 
---
Ps4, I saw a couple nukes, but they were around watogo

They initially didn’t intend for these things to come out weekly. It was just supposed to be during wild Appalachia. People liked it though so they said they would continue. Not every week is going to be filled with breaking news. They told us that back in the spring. 
---
My point is, some weeks there just isn’t a lot to report on. Expecting huge announcements every week is a little unrealistic. Mischief stats and NW stats is exactly what they should be reporting on this week.
---
Thx for the suggestions
---
Thats Great!
---
Get a fucking job faglot
---
I think I would’ve shot the higher levels
---
What do you mean by wore off? Are you not running starched genes, or are you saying the 1 hr with no negative effects wore off and then you had both?
---
So you are Atlas then?
---
&gt;It didn't work at launch, and it won't work now. While they stay quiet, players and gaming media alike tear them apart. If Wastelanders is a failure, this game is finally done.
---
for sure
---
you cant be this ignorant. look at all thos shit bgs is doing, and then take a look at the promises they made ages ago.
---
I have the white ones, and you can build blinking (which is where one that comes up first) solid light, and twinkle effect. Is it maybe the same for those?
---
This ^
---
Pre-made groups and certain solo builds have very little incentive to nuke on a public server if they don't have to. Private is less lag, less competition for legendary kills, and less interference with certain playstyles that could slightly compromise/slow down a SBQ or Whitesprings run.
---
I do miss all of the public nukes :(
---
•yes
---
•don’t care
---
•no I think Bethesda need to get their stuff together and not paywall everything
---
The paintball gun is perfect for griefers, which is probably why it's not available in the game. They made it weigh so much so people would stop carrying it, not just to "troll" them. Yes, they could have just deleted it, but I'm sure there's a reason why they didn't.
---
chain shot could be entertaining, especially in combination with bloody mess :) 
---
Hit would shred SB wings - would think that would bring them to the ground almost immediately.
---
I will not discriminate and kill stuff that is not moving to
---
That’s awesome I was unaware it’s been spotted in wastelanders photos
---
On 'This Morning' with Phillip Schofield?
---
A hope, they fix the gameplay
---
Except, this year it would be called Nuka Cola Winter Spiced Cranberry.
---
Shut up already, jesus.
---
Melee is used to kill in one but what makes all cc effects useless
---
A mediocre non open world rpg with a linear questline? no thanks.
---
great find.  Enjoy it!
---
Yes and I understand this I’m just bringing light to what is a stupid flaw in a big company, if you like the game the play it don’t tell me what to do just please keep in mind the issues that come with it
---
The wasteland changes people.
---
Sorry don’t want to pay 100$ a year for features we were promised from the start
---
Yes, because who trusts their words anyway? At this point, I do not believe anything they say.
---
any1 asked you?
---
I honestly don't care what you do. However there's better games out there. I'm just attempting to get my Glowing Skeleton suit once that's done I'll be back in Borderlands
---
Thats how much the company is worth, not how much money the company has ...
---
If you like the game,ok don’t care go play just stop being a little two year old and lying on a forum to prove a point
---
Anyone?
---
If you can trust a stranget I volunteer as a mule. I know it's not what you asked, but it's still a method with lot less risk, unless the trade bug is present. (Please give me a reason to log into the game)
---
Definitely worth to use this serum, schorchbeast food will heal you by 400hp and you can eat like 5 at once what makes you almost immortal for about 30 seconds
---
Thank you so much.
---
Oh Cmon ----- BOXING ROBOTS!

With carnivore there is actually very little you cannot get food points from.

“Honey, we need to talk. Reddit says, based on their right to opine on anything and everything, that we need to re-evaluate our lives. We’re separating until Reddit says we can be together. I’ll see you in-game.”

Does this mutation actually work properly? I have it and I eat veg all the time and it fills my hunger bar!
---
Yeah, when we play rocket league it brings out a different side of me. Lol so I’m with her 😂
---
So? You already paid for the game. Had they made a better game or supported it properly they would of made more money and had more players.
---
Can I copy paste this to send to him? 😂

Longer story.

&gt;I'd genuinely suggest not buying video games on a promise of what they could be though. Either buy them for what they are right now, or wait and buy them when and if that promise is fulfilled, and to make sure you're not filling in the blanks yourself of what that promise actually is.
---
yes, Fo76 learned me this hard lesson. I will never pre-order again and I will never buy a Bethesda game in the first year.
---
You still get water from shit like corn soup, and depending on what they make, they still get the food %. I've been running carnivore since the start, and there is very little you actually don't benefit from.
---
I do agree with this assessment.
---
I haven't run into them, but they're a notorious group called E.A.T.T.  - Establishment of Appalachian Taste Testers.

Yea exactly that’s the problem, it’s a game it’s made to have fun so why are people fighting just because some don’t care about the fallout 1st being expensive and others don’t, just leave it at that don’t make a damn war over a game
---
Shhh. Don't give Bethesda more ideas.
---
"Only 50 Atoms for an hour of double-XP!"
---
Because of all this recent shit, I actually cannot get excited at any announcement they make, because I immediately worry that it will be paywalled.
---
lol it's pretty short but yeah if you want a conversation simulator it's supposed to be pretty good
---
well it aint no AAA-game.

---
Imagine scything down a clutch of ghouls with such a weapon. Just pieces of bodies everywhere.
---
Best freaking post about this game and experience in ever. Congratulations sweetie and thanks for sharing this beautiful message much needed:)
---
Haha. We are in the presence of the undisputed king of trap camps. All hail! 🤴
---
That has been happening for a bit. If it is on say a section of roof then replace that section and you should be able to place the turret again. I actually just used the opportunity to rebuild my whole camp......not ideal but it fixed the problem
---
Sounds like mobs trashed your camp.
---
  
---
For the crops scrap and replant them.  
---
I have had this issue with turrets myself before. scrap/store whatever they are sitting on and it should reappear in your stored tab.  
---
It just works!  
---
[](/puudding)
---
Thanks for the tip!  I'll try that out next time I do a silo.
---
Shhh.   
---
Don't tell Bethesda.  Let the small blessings happen.

---
The freak show in the North West of the cranberry bog
---
Will give it a try.
---
Let it die and mabey we will get a real fallout game next
---
I met my husband playing call of duty black ops 1. I hit him with a grenade, he swore at me profusely..... we’ve now been married 7 years and have 2 kids ❤️
---
They could make the damage massive but has to be point target and make the fatman an area target massive damage dealer.
---
Can't wait for the rage posts from someone that got a reeefund and is confused as to why they can't play any more.
---
IIRC, there's not a ton of mods for a gatling laser, but I may be thinking of another heavy gun
---
Actually this makes more sense, ever since I stopped 76 I actually started feeling better...and I agree with the story drivin games with definite ending, trust me they help big time. Within a month around my work schedule I was able to beat AC Odyssey mostly. And now I’m going to go back to days gone. Reach out by talking with people. If you can relate to someone with depression it makes them feel a lot better. (What I’m trying to say is try different multiplayer games)
---
1. You got a replacement
---
2. They changed enough and you get better repair kits by playing the game, as in killing the queen (No pay 2 win here)
---
3. Has anyone ever used them? They are useless with stash boxes literally everywhere
---
4. You find enough food for this not being an issue and i dont see how it got worse.
---
5. Not an issue since you can grind the atoms for it easily. But i wish there was a quest for the base model.
---
6. What?
---
7. Is this even English anymore?
---
8. Its a tent not a camp and you cant even customize it.
---
9. Anyone who expected free private servers/sessions is a moron.
---
10. yes, and im glad it turned into 76 and wasnt part of 4
---
I hope your tinfoil hat isnt too tight.
---
Holy fuckin crap shit fuck, that is the coolist thing i've ever heard!
---
23 years ago my wife and I married less than nine month after our 1st date and before the replies a baby was not involved our 1st is 18 now. When it's right it's right. Congratulations to them.
---
Would you say it's worth $60 or is it only good if you pay the dollar for it on gamepass?
---
Pvp and trading
---
I'm not saying it can't work, there are plenty of examples of it working and plenty of it not, but there's no doubt giving it time and really getting to know the person is beneficial and is statically proven to decrease divorce rates.
---
I played on free private servers in many games. Why is this one paid for?
---
Life is too short to mess around. Find someone you enjoy being around and give it a shot.
---
How are you not banned?
---
Feel free to join up with us on our Discord server - adult only group mostly weapon vendors, but we do go out and muck it up on events and such.  My IGNs: .MisterGunn or MisterGunn
---
You’re who Bethesda thinks all of the players are
---
Todd's Jacket:  "It just works bro."
---
Ignorance or arrogance, someone help me decide what this post is.
---
It will be as useless as the crossbow
---
Good to know bro
---
Maybe not really, also found a bunch of arrow types, plasma, explosive, etc... 
---
So hopefully they're also adding an ammo system similar to the one from New Vegas.
---
and the game I bought last October didn't have Nuclear Winter...or Tadpole/Possum badges w/ backpacks...or Vault Raids...or special events (Mischief Night / Meat Week / Faschnacht)...or Private servers...
---
I paid for a game...they added more to it with more to come...I'm ok with paying a monthly pittance...
---
Did you just say you spent close to a thousand dollars on this game?
---
Same here. I did the exact same thing and had a group of level 150-200s clear it out. Then I saw a group of level 1-5s coming to find “free stuff” so I just gave them some of my low level weapons, food, ammo, and amour.
---
Thanks for the correction, I'll need to take a look in this.
---
I would suggest troll, which encompasses arrogant ignorance.
---
i have played it though 2 times now, in progress of a 3rd playthough, and i would def pay 60 for it, if it got removed from xbox gamepass.
---
Always thought that there can't be anything free in vendors, every time I tried buying something for literal zero, game would bitch about "internal server errors", and "transaction couldn't be proceeded" etc.
---
There is an issue currently where those type of things are bleeding through between servers, also area common are areas that are looted and events triggered.
---
They will put it behind a pay wall like they do with everyone's ideas. There so damn greedy!
---
I had herbivore, starched genes. I drank a carnivore serum thinking it would remove my herbivore mutation but it only suppressed herbivore for 1 hour, and then it came back and carnivore didn't; stick.
---
Probably because a nuke is a bomb and a bomb kills things
---
Is there anything about this game you DO like?
---
Loosley translated "your as useful as sweat on my balls in an ice storm"
---
Raidin' and tradin'
---
When they had that double xp a month or so ago that was the most I’ve ever played fallout 76. I completely agree they should definitely do more xp events rather than these dumb events meant to grind for costumes and cosmetics. I’d don’t give a shit about those lol.
---
Weird, when I tried that it didn't let me drink the mutation serum! Wonder which one of us was bugged XD
---
Remember when everyone blew Obsidian for New Vegas?
---
Look at all the mods!!! Look at all the ammo!!!
---
I was stoke for TOW...first vending machine I see "Light / Heavy / Energy ammo"
---
ummm....wtf?
---
They’re called whales. Freemium isn’t free. South Park S:18 E: 6
---
Not enough people have purchased the 200 atom Community Engagement Kits from the Atom Shop yet.
---
If this bow is anything like the bow added for FO4 via mods, then this will be an awesome weapon!
---
Ok porfag
---
Cool experiment. Thanks for sharing.
---
Honestly I enjoy exploring the map.  
---
Aside from a one month break I have played this game weekly since launch. I haven't stuck with a game like that since my WoW days.  
---
Other than that I love helping my friends on Discord find gear and supplies for their builds, run events, etc. The social aspect of the game is my real endgame.  
---
I also purposefully run non-optimal builds and try to perfectly gear them. It adds challenge and I can get gear that isn't really in demand. (Bloody pistol build has surprised a few PVPers)  
---
Other thank that, tweaking my camps (Currently I have a pawn shop, brothel/motel, church, and am working on a mobile home/roadside attraction)  
---
This game really is a "make your own fun" experience. 
---
[](/flutterball)
---
Getting the last achievement so I can uninstall the game.
---
500 Atoms
---
On my brothers private server I went to WS to farm some ghouls. all the ones in the clubhouse were max level, the rest everywhere else were like lvl 9. Really annoying cause we're both over 100.
---
Well played.
---
I like the 16 times the detail.
---
Yes got a problemo poorpablo?
---
Nah but you clearly do
---
Thirst zapper PVP!! 😁
---
I really hate this man... I never clear whitesprings without a nuke and my private has been up for over 1,5hours before nuking... hope they fix this soon and thanks for the info
---
Nuka cola test dome.. where get the mysterious Nuka cola cranberry plus a recipe to make it.. it’s a Nuka cola that provides a bonus xp effect like other cranberry based recipes!
---
No let my idea completely stolen from another Redditor, but I thought it would be a brilliant idea to put into a tnt dome!
---
gosh some1 is triggered..
---
Nobody promised anything from start.
---
There's a lot more to a relationship than "are they a good person?". Plenty of good people get divorced for countless reasons. 
---
I'm not saying you have no idea what you're doing or that you're immature but it's most certainly rushed and you have nothing to gain from it. 
---
You chose to share this with the internet, you should probably expect some unsolicited advice. Obviously you don't have to follow it or even reply, but it's here 
---
and you can do with that what you will.
---
Yeah! I am the one with a problem when I am paying Bethesda enough to keep the servers open
---
Your fucking welcome child
---
Meeting your partner in Fallout 76? Well, I guess you've done the hardest part of the relationship first, it can only get better after that experience!
---
Pretty much log on, get caps and scrip, look for pvp opportunities, server hop 12 times, log off.
---
I'm asking a real question. All I ever see is you being negative on almost every post. I enjoy the world and exploring, and happening upon cool little scenes in the game such as a random pile of skeletons or the spooky noose tree all by itself. What is it that keeps you playing?
---
It's just unsolicited relationship advice that nobody asked for. They are probably being told this by people they know already, last thing they probably want is a bunch of people on a Fallout sub telling them what they've already heard.
---
Lol yeah cause you are
---
I could get on bored with the thirst zapper 😂
---
This happened  to me  I left the world and returned and it was fixed
---
Just don't forget Power User and Stabilized.
---
I've read that if you leave and rejoin the server they will respawn.
---
Credit where it's due Nuclear Winter was a solid addition. However the backpacks are grindy as hell, vault raids are glorified fetch quests with grindy rewards (and is VERY buggy), as for the events I only played meatweak, which was OK I guess. I missed Fasnacht and uninstalled before mischief. 
---
Compare that additional content to the state ESO was in at the end of year one and you will see why I think it's terrible value. ESO had Craglorn, an entire new map full of fully voiced quests, multiplayer and solo trials and challenges ,multiple end game quality bosses and actual dungeon raids with unique mechanics and worthwhile rewards. 
---
ESO had an entire map of end game content. 76 has the SBQ, which may or may not land, may or may not drop rewards and may or may not fly off the map . . .
---
Once you hit end game in 76 it's one shotting most things in 2/3rds of the map and grinding the very unrewarding SBQ. Sorry but that just isn't worth another penny to me.
---
Raiding workshops, I guess.
---
Just uninstall now and go away
---
Same thing happened when I nuked burrows all this week
---
I've got a *** executioners explosive lmg! But I've only been able to use it a couple times because it really eats up bullets..! Its badass though!
---
There's a decent amount but not a ton.
---
Because your thousand dollars can single handedly keep this game alive for years to come. Thanks for being stupid enough to support this game
---
I think ban wave won't help, and the skins its not the main issue. The nw mod itself. I not joking that today in each mutch at least 3 hackers if not more. Numerous new players just killing everyone and flying around.
---
The had to integrate anti cheat software into the game, like other companies. If they will ban (I'll be more than satisfied) the same guys will pick new code for game fo 10 bucks and all over again.
---
That's because Bethesda doesn't know how to make drop rates actually feel rewarding.
---
But they *help.*
---
I will when I get the achievement.
---
im just voicing my opinion, dosent mean im poor, i just see where the gaming industry is going..
---
and you are not making it better.
---
The LMG (Light Machine Gun) has the highest total damage per second numbers beating out the .50 cal and minigun.  Get a faster fire rate version and you'll really own the world with one of those.  Bethesda buffed up the LMG damage numbers and accuracy earlier this year and this weapon now performs wonderfully and is fun to shoot.  I now run an LMG build with an Anti-Armor 25 faster rate, Instigating 25 faster fire rate, and a Vampires 25 faster fire rate.
---
Power user works on fusions in the gun? Didnt know that
---
Tank Killer does not negate AA prefix, it's just that they stack with diminishing returns.
---
Bravo on being the bigliest, most tremendous fan.  🤔🤮
---
What platform? it's worth noting that hackers are only a problem on PC.
---
Poor people voice their opinion
---
Thanks for the tip, lets see if it works
---
I know this does not fix already plundered areas and event being triggered, maybe it helps with respawns though
---
Yeah, it's pretty fucking excellent. Goes up from 500 shots per Fusion Core to 1000.
---
Actually makes it one of the better heavy weapons to use and the cheapest to feed ammo into, TBH.
---
Yeah for some reason spoiled vegetables are not vegetables and Since i have herbivore I can eat spoiled meat too and still get food from it. I dont understand the spoiled vegetables part because I can get diseases from it. I always carry spoiled vegetables on me tho because its a good source of food and dont weigh much.
---
I'd say that's okay if you're in a higher level area (but not so much if it's near the vault and marked up as being for new players).
---
so your stand on gaming is that only wealthy people can play games?
---
It may be, he often showing in his videos many various mods as background when his speaking about fo76
---
No saying they aren’t dropping just saying I very much seems to me that they may have always been nerfed.  If I do ANYTHING each day, I do these two dailies and was raking in badges after they fixed them. Now all the sudden they’ve been reduced to a occasional drip.  I’d get if it was sporadic but to go from two a day for weeks to now almost none for weeks?   That’s not RNG.
---
After you nuke, leave your world and return to it and it will reset their spawn.
---
I e never seen the “limb damage” work.... ever. Everything dies in one shot with mele anyway so I don’t think it matters. But for rifles, it would be nice to see them cripple like with enforcer.
---
Looking for plans, exploring, trying to find an ideal 3 star.
---
I like the idea.
---
But first they would need to rebalance pvp and probably most of the weapons. Rigt now in pve you want to do the most possible dmg in one shot, but pvp dmg is capped at 110 so you want high fire rate. This makes all explosive weapons and rifles useless. 
---
And second they would need to make game that can run this event... Look at Halloween... The servers would die in fire if you had lot of players and npcs fighting in one spot.
---

After THIS comment, I paid Todd Howard one million dollars to sleep with my fiancee.
---
Holy shit, had no idea. Thanks for the tip
---
:-)
---
I get that but 38 sucks even at low lvls to the point I never used it until I picked up a high lvl gun. At an equal lvl 38 just doesnt hit hard enough it's better off to personally give them some 308 and a decent rifle teach them to go slow, crouch, and aim for the head...one and done
---
Not everyone does a Meta Bloodied build! :)
---
How long has this game been out? If you met this person in the game, is that long enough to know that this is worth the cost of a marriage?
---
I know a few friends over the years that have met playing games and then got married. Most never really dated or lived with a partner and once they did, they felt trapped. 
---
Make sure you know what you are getting into before going through with it. If you are 100% sure than congratulations and enjoy the life you will make in the wastelands to come!!!
---
Your PA must smell quite bad inside :)
---
But I do agree with your points. Also it's very easy on maintenance.
---
I pvp in PA; to stay competitive it is basically required to engage from afar, use stealthboy torso and preferably customised Strangler. It's fun, though.
---
&gt;So hopefully they're also adding an ammo system similar to the one from New Vegas.
---
Oh I don't know, that sounds like a lot of work.
---
Which one?
---
The game is barely out a year and you're already getting married. Good luck but fuck, that's way too soon.
---
I just want my Recon Helmet functionality back...
---
This game has been out long enough for people to get married from it? :O
---
in my experience it depends a lot on the location of the camp, and on the camp itself? just for fun I've put my free vending machine on a cliff, that way if someone is clearing it out i check their lvl and maybe leave the game if they are just being jerks and they fall to their deaths. hehe. someone even dropped me some stuff so I'd put it on my free vending machine! heart melted that day.
---
Full health melee build will one hit as well, I even have a video with my full health build here: https://youtu.be/F9OmHxl-hEs
---
And they likely followed you around for the rest of your sesh, no?
---
\+50% Limb damage is actually very very good.  
---
\-Against large NPC's like the Queen for example, when people aren't cheesing her out with BE Explosive gatling plasma's you can cripple her limbs and keep her on the ground for longer periods and force her to land more.  
---
\-Again "Tanky" regular NPC's on Shotguns it's exception in solo and team encounters (again non-bloodied meta, because not everyone uses it) because you more or less effectively cripple everything with an Enforcer build.  
---
\-Against other Tanky NPC's, or non-tanky for quicker kills, you can stack damage bonuses for great damage numbers (aka Instigating + limb damage, hit a limb and watch the great damage numbers)   
---
\-Unless my memory has failed me, When you break a limb, but don't dismember it, you then do double damage to the limb, which is again great again Bosses and Tanky NPC's
---
Wasn't there a Nuka Cherry PA skin recently datamined?
---
My build's already nerfed. It's probably the worst in the entire game.
---
Can’t remember if it was for PA. I definitely saw it on combat armor in the leaks.
---
This is bait
---
It's polygon the most unreliable source of information ever.
---
This is also from tgose asshats if you don't believe me
---
Polygon TSE lmao https://imgur.com/a/KgW174P
---
Um, why would they? I would stay in this subreddit more often if I was actively playing the game.
---
Yeah, that's the major issue for me too. :(
---
My hunch is that somebody has to go through the Free States quest on a particular world - this causes the Strangler Blooms to spawn regularly on that server (or perhaps whoever causes the blooms to spawn only picks a couple for the quest and leaves the rest).
---
Fewer people are going through the Free States quest these days so the rest of us see fewer Strangler Blooms as a result.
---
"kills in two shots" :))
---
That's just gold.
---
Kill 20 players.
---
Ohh yess I remember this datamine now! It came alongside the Nuka cola fridge were still yet to see in the atomic shop..
---
Probably a Nuka cola bundle will arrive in the atomic shop one day!
---
Seems like an integration of elder scrolls with the citadel and multi faction pve/pvp
---
Yup, especially since 2 shot has meant fires 2 shots since they first introduced it as an effect. Shows they don't play the games they write about.
---
Ah cool! There's 8 Domes total yeah? With 3 that are unlocked?
---
Yeah. T51 nuka cola, alien blaster and x-01 nuka quantum.
---
Then you'd need to switch the "receiver" each time you'd want to use a different arrow type.
---
I quite enjoy these absolutely misinformed articles, based in singular and extremely dubious sources. 
---
With that said, Bethesda is really the one to blame for its horrible PR image. You reap what you sow.
---
Of course they don't.
---
Ya to play a 10 hour game
---
If it is something useful and I plan on selling for anything more than scripx20 I try and add some mods to it
---
Lol it's a little late now. No posts get noticed anymore unless they're complaints about 1st.
---
Hi.  There are many items that contain acid.  Also, acid can be farmed from certain mobs.
---
Sometime ago there was a Reddit thread on this topic.  Link is below.
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bk4nux/is\_there\_a\_good\_place\_to\_farm\_acid/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bk4nux/is_there_a_good_place_to_farm_acid/)
---
 Best idea this community ever had besides player vending
---
Sure they are
---
sounds like your base might have been attacked by (at least one) L80 SB.
---
At the moment, mainly do a junk run, join the queen if it pops, work on some of the challenges here and there and after last night, it'll be scratch up caps as I cleaned myself out getting my hands on a 3 star Fixer for my rifle alt amongst other bits.
---
I've not launched a nuke in a few weeks, might do that tonight if I've time.
---
It's easier to skim reddit. Why play?
---
I had someone clean me out spending almost 15K in one visit.  Lost out on about 6K caps in that deal alone. 
---
Was pretty bummed as 6K can get you a decent legendary weapon.  Oh well.
---
Not even gay or anything, but i fucking love /r/gayfortodd
---
It's totally possible. Just look at GTA V and GTA Online. Literally the exact same map, but they were able to have an online and offline version, and both have things that are unique to each.

I wish Fallout 76 had an offline version. I just bought it last week because it was on sale in the Xbox Store for $20. But unfortunately I don't have actual wifi. I'm using my phone's mobile hotspot. Which is good enough for downloading games and watch Netflix/YouTube/etc, but not for playing online multiplayer.
---
Sometimes. If it has super desirable prefixes i dont bother. It will sell regardless.
---
Semi desirable i will mod.
---
Proably call you names because they have spent, caps, resources and time to build a workshop to farm for essential items needed such as food, ammo, water and more resources. Only then to have someone pull an ass move and come in and kill them with one-shot weapons, not for the workshop which is not claimed, but just because they are bored and want to prove they have a bigger cyber dick. You want PvP, go play Nuclear Winter.
---
I'm on Xbox One and not experiencing much, it's mostly just laggy at a few areas and that's really it.
---
No, not really. Exceptions might include weapons with hard to find mods, like VATSed Radium Rifle.
---
I did think it was a great idea, that’s why I ha to steal it to input on his post! If I could find the OG post I would but it was from quite a few days ago and I didn’t comment myself 😭
---
Fuck the upper class! Kill all 1st members!
---
Yup!
---
Dude.. they have buffed weapon durability. You are so off base.
---
At least some thing good came out of this game just don't let Bethesda organise your wedding
---
Sometimes, I've an AA combat rifle up in my machine at the moment which I tweaked up, but otherwise I tend to list stuff that's not particularly useful or sought after for 200-500 caps a time as they tend to sell fairly quickly to the folks looking for a quick scrip turn in.
---
No.
---
Oh huh. It looks a bit different from [the glimpse we saw in the trailer](https://i.imgur.com/6ALLPh8.png), but maybe my eyes are playing tricks on me.
---
Bethesda's figured out that new weapons need legendary variants to be viable, and the gear they add in expansions is usually a little pushed compared to base game items, so I'm not really worried about the bow sucking. I just hope the Crossbow gets a buff, too.
---
For plastic go to Whitespring and grab all those golf balls
---
more collectibles would be awesome; also, mayb new sheet musics for all the instruments we play?
---
I love my premium subscription. 
---
I also love seeing whiney kids make stupid posts.
---
Nah.
---
Thanks!
---
I think their infamous Doom 2016 playthrough confirmed that.
---
It's not like when I was growing up, and you had video game journalists whose actual career was writing for the magazine and had a wide breadth of experience to pull from because they witnessed the whole thing from the beginning.  The people who write these articles now come across like spoiled brats who would rather be writing about theater or art house movies, but instead find themselves stuck talking about video games which are far too *bourgeois* for their palate.
---
This is a general criticism of video game journalism, but it's also a broader problem I have with the Vox Media empire.  Whether it's Polygon, Verge, or Vox itself, they consistently take this snooty on-high attitude about things and talk down to the reader.  Maybe some people are really into that.  I'm not, especially when I can clearly see they have no idea what they're talking about half the time, and the confidence is just a cover.
---
Last weeks was so bad it never got a pin lil.
---
Wow, that’s heartbreaking. I know that feeling, was in a similar situation in the past. The best is just to let it go. The emotional bonds though.. Doesn’t help being a rather sentimental type of person.
---
It’s the same price as a AAA game..
---
Congratulations!! This is so sweet we're so happy for you!
---
Yeah, I thought the article was more funny than anything.
---
It just works
---
You spoilsports always gotta bring up logistics 😂
---
Firstly, it's a 9 charisma perk so it should be damn good. Secondly, I don't know a single player who uses it.
---

They already mentioned a faction based pvp system here:

---
Was 3 right in a row last night on my server. All 3 SBQ.
---
How come you don't drop one?
---
It may be a modded base bow. Or there are different models, less likely. Or there are different ATX skins.
---
Polygon is basically just click bait and I completely ignore them.
---
&gt;every time I tried buying something for literal zero, game would bitch about "internal server errors", and "transaction couldn't be proceeded" 
---
I think that's normally only the vendor bots. If they have something listed for 0 caps you generally can't get it
---
You don’t “lose”caps. But no, you don’t gain them.
---
Press X to doubt
---
The timer is quite generous, 30-45 mins i think. I just alt tab back over once in a while
---
Just to add another link for videos of this rampant cheating, here's a video from Captainoob regarding this as well, including footage of one of the same players in Juicehead's video I believe.

Yeah, it really sucks. He was the one person I felt I could tell my darkest thoughts to, and he would never judge me for them. He just moved in with his gf not too long ago. I hope it works out for them.
---
Oh decisions decisions. Got 700 atoms atm and  Christmas is right around the corner, it would be nice to get something that passes for decorations up, on the other hand I'd quite like to get the Red Rocket garage door to jazz up the camp a little.
---
All of those websites basically create click bait articles to drive traffic. It's quite sad actually especially since they create so much ill will and hate.
---
Love this idea.
---
You're trying to reason with a nazi.
---
Imagine getting taken out by an opposing support bot npc in a battle lol that'd sting. I hate pvp mainly because I panic and all logical maneuvers I may know or have thought of beforehand flitter away. I'd try this tho.
---
Sounds exactly like something my first girlfriend could have said when we started dating in our teenage years.
---
How about delivering presents?? Kinda like how the messenger works, you just get led around some different towns and put gifts under trees. Maybe you get attacked by stuff while you do it.
---
Please follow up and share some photos with us :)
---
I had a guy last weekend that wasn’t happy I killed him and started wrecking his camp so he’l sent numerous messages to me (threats, derogatory comments) so I reported him.  The threads crossed the line for me as that’s the only example I have reported someone.  People can get pissy and send nasty messages that usually don’t bother me but I don’t need you threatening me and my family.  Get a different hobby.
---
For weapons I generally don't but for armor pieces I do. If it's combat armor  I'll make it BOS for instance.  I'll also always make it ultralight, but that's mainly just to conserve stash space!
---
i fight them all the time in nw
---
9 charisma is irrelevant since u can stack it with bloody mess easily and then damage perks
---
its op as shit
---
fuck me, that looks so shitty
---
I've seen various complaints about atom shop decor, and never heard of any of them being fixed.
---
It's actually one of the things Bethesda really needs to improve on. For example, I bought the West Virginia signs (one big and one small glowy sign that's shaped like W. Virginia) and the signs consumed something like 8-10% of my budget, which was absolutely ridiculous. I made a post about it and I think submitted a ticket but even today these signs consume a buttload of budget and just plain aren't worth using. 
---
It's like throwing money away. :/
---
I’m still grinding for all the Shielded Underarmor plans. Always looking for stable flux for crafting, including Ultracite ammo. Also, grinding Encryptid for The Fixer Plan. 
---
About to start shopping for Legendary Marine Armor set (preferably Chameleon). 
---
Always looking for AAE Auto Weapons. 
---
Exploring new locations is also fun.
---
Sub optimal on both. Energy weapons in general don't perform well, despite the changes that make them benefit from armor penetration perks and legendary effects, so Flamer doesn't do that well, plus the ammo is a real pain to keep stocked, and no ultracite version. Miniguns fire very fast and have low damage per shot. Due to how armor works in 76 (same as fallout 4) very fast firing weapons with low damage per shot do not perform well against armored targets (ie, most end game enemies). The .50 cal is a very nice middle ground, and has the highest effective sustained dps. LMG has higher burst dps, but the ammo is awful to keep up on (goes through .308 faster than the .50 goes through .50, and you craft .50 in much larger batches) and I just don't like how it handles - very high recoil and not as easy to keep it on target. Gatling plasma is very ammo efficient, but hard to control, spin up time sucks, and suffers from the games bias against energy weapons.

I know its not everyone's thing but i got mine in nuclear winter.  Sorry that guy told you to just leave.  I mean i know about chasing a platinum trophy.  I played 138 hours of the first surge.
---
Mines been working fine, I'd contact support
---
I don't mod them modded weapons are heavier why take on the extra weight in your stash.
---
 from my knowledge of this game intelligence no longer gives more xp like fallout 4 and it is the same amount of xp a 1 intelligence character gets
---
I mod lower-level weapons, under the assumption that someone buying it is also lower-level and may not know the plans yet. Top-level weapons, no. All combat armor gets BOS, scout armor gets polymer if I have any extra, and so on, and I throw deep pocketed onto everything. Doesn't increase the value, but it seems to help it sell quicker.
---
I was doing that for awhile and it did help to move rifles that hadn't moved before, but I gave up on it. The extra weight was killing my stash limit, and I don't have a scrap box. If I did, I would. 
---
Kind of sucks though, as I know the three I have for sale would totally sell if I upped there damage numbers and put suppressors on them.
---
Most people have their own specific mods in mind so I don't mod before selling.  After someone has decided to buy, then I will offer to mod it anyway they want.  I know all the gun mods except for the radiums which I rarely use.
---
Beef Jerky 😂😂😂 do you use its initials for short?
---
A match-making service in Fallout 76?  How many atoms is Bethesda charging for this? Or is this a Fallout 1st? /s
---
But seriously, congratulations.
---
Ooh that panic is what I like about it! You can't rely on the same old same old tactics you use on NPCs. You'd be surprised what you can come up with in the fly when you can't rely on predictable opponents. It does take some practice though.
---
It was probably the intention but everything was ported from fo4 without changes to exp system. Unless you can show me video clip showing character with low intelligence getting 350 exp per super mutant kill
---
And people say this game doesn't make people happy
---
Scrap every laser gun with scrapper perk, tins of plastic.
---
Toke me awhile to figure out. But I'm liiike 90% sure they mainly bloom at night. Have you tried searching for them at nighttime?
---
lol it me. Thanks for thinking it was a good idea though

---
If we keep suggesting it, Bethesda will know we want it as a new quest
---
Did someone say legendary lootboxes? Because you absolutely know they're coming at this point. Pay to win randomized 3 star legendaries, maybe 3 for a dollar or something.
---
I hear Three Dog might be available to officiate or broadcast it on GNR.
---
I've been working with friends lately, they're stinky sneaks, but it's less pressure at least :)
---
Why are you throwing gunpods into this?  They were spun up because the pilot fired the weapons while doing orbital runs.  They weren't operated by a gunner.  Because of the nature of the guns themselves, you kept them spun up to prevent jamming if the pilot fired the guns before the barrels spun down.  
---
Hand operated miniguns (ie. requires a gunner to fire) do not have a 'spin up' switch/button.  They have two thumb depressed triggers for firing and a similar trigger/switch on the side for comms.  
---
That isn't to say that making the minigun in game have a viarable trigger cycle (partial pull to spin up, full pull to fire) isn't a good idea, I actually would support that fully, just correcting the notion of how a minigun works.  Never know when you will need that knowledge, in case the zombies come.
---
Oh shit! Ahaha sorry flooping! Was in no way tryna steal your thunder! Personally it’s one of the best suggestions I’ve seen in a while! 😁
---
I mean, you can't know for sure what their perk loadout is. Maybe they're using Tank Killer and Bloody Mess (who isn't?) and they're getting massive damage from a scoped lever or fully charged assaultron head.  Or they're cheating.  I think is less likely they're using tenderizer, most players would have to respec to get it since charisma is often a dump stat.
---
i see the increased damage taken message
---
you ain't gaslighting me
---
charisma is amazing in nw
---
if you want ur OP perk to not be nerfed fine but stop defending it
---
Lots of "non-meat" items can still be eaten that you wouldn't expect. Can't eat corn but mutfruit and a few flowers still work. One thing that works well is "drinking" Inert Flux (expired raw flux) and raw flux to get a 5% reduction in getting diseases, then eating spoiled meats.
---
Personally I keep all my ionized meats (they NEVER go bad) and drinking only inert fluxs. the I use my 24-25 water purifiers to dilute down stimpacks and rad-away.  Chemist and Super-Duper makes it easy have an overabundance of  aid.
---
The fridge is only marginally useful.
---
bloodied, yeah. Might be with chems active.
---
I don't properly remember whether its with or without, since i haven't played in a while
---
no way this is real.
---
Nice, now they can add a rock as a weapon and called it rust 76
---
As far as I understand it, AA doesn't work as a straight stack, rather it goes sequentially, so you're not getting a flat 86% boost. (Someone correct me if I'm wrong)
---
So let us say you've got an AA assault rifle paired with tank killer and the target has a DR of 100.
---
The weapon mod takes priority, so the DR is immediately halved down to 50.
---
Tank Killer kicks in next, but that 36% is based off the now 50DR and not the original 100DR, so it works out at about 18, taking the final DR to 32, so that translates to 68% reduction.
---
That's where the diminishing returns come from, each works after the other so you're shaving a smaller and smaller amount each time away the more you stack it.
---
They should also spawn with the" heart of the swamp event "
---
It's not stealing if it's a suggestion, suggestions should be repeated by as many people as possible. I don't even have any thunder to steal. So keep on carrying on with it my friend haha
---
This is all so dumb
---
I sure will do! We need to get this in game!!
---
I would buy that for a dollar.
---
1. I don't have that perk, I do just fine without it. 
---
2. I've literally played about 65 NW matches in the last week and not seen that message once. You must be unlucky. 
---
3. I'm not gaslighting you, I'm sharing my experience. You don't have to believe me.
---
Shrunk big time.... I was an avid daily player who was actively getting my friends to play. What you would call a hardcore fan... after repeated nerfs in adventure and the gutting of pvp, then the nerfing and ultimately the shutdown of survival, and finally a lack of end game content (since pvp is gone), I have pretty much quit playing. 
---
If players like me are quitting you know they have a problem.
---
When do you plan on fixing this issue where chest pieces are showing through clothing?? I purchased certain cosmetic costumes with real hard earned cash, and I am not able to use it because of this issue, going on two months now! Get to fixing it!
---
The sheepsquatch questline is fun. Nuclear winter is fun. Backpack is useful. Vault raids are fun. Burrows is fun once or twice.

Another day, another toxic bethesda fanboy post.

Building a underground maze camp to enjoy people  is top of my priority now . Also encrypted , project paradise and a solo run .  Campfire tales for the possum badge reward .

AND FIX JET PACKS!!!
---
Nice build / combo video!
---
Trash mobs of course, same with Instigating with the correct combo's, was more saying there are people who use non-cookie cutter bloodied meta builds, your combo shows that :)
---
I haven't played in a while....The Other Worlds has me hooked, but if a double XP weekend were to come along, I'd be playing that weekend.
---
This subreddit is just bandvagon central full of people who are not playing the game. The casual, market and settlement subreddits are much better platforms for us who enjoy the game
---
Laughter and Sorry are the most needed emotes. I’d trade these new dancing ones for them if I could.
---
Mods sometimes triples or even quadruples the weight of weapons (like handmade...), so I remove all the mods before stashing them. Most mods are user dependent, so future buyer will modify it by itself anyway, so there is no sense to stash them fully modded.
---
Problem with those statistics is that it also incorporates all the drunken Vegas (and other similar locations) marriages that end up annulled the next morning.  
---
Statistics are only as valuable as the data pool from which they are drawn.
---
While not to the degree of your experiment,  I've had similar things happen at my camp, and when I dump ammo at train stations.  I used to throw trash ammo in my vend for 0 and it would always get scooped by someone high enough level whom I would assume wouldnt need it.  Same thing when I dump ammo I don't need in a suitcase at a train station. 
---
I don't get it.
---
They need to make it so the food does not spoil while in the fridge. I’d be very happy to be a food vendor if that were the case.
---
The tiff taffing taff're you on about, "Charisma is amazing in NW"?
---
No it ain't. Support builds are shithouse in this game. I've been *only* playing a Charisma-build since launch. I'd know. ***ESPECIALLY*** in bloody NW. I get dropped from groups, *FREQUENTLY*, when they find out I'm running a 15-CHA build in PvE **AND** PvP.
---
Get your dookies straight. You've plopped all over the floor, and now they look a total mess, rather than just being a mess.
---
Oh thanks, I haven’t kept up with this game at all since I stopped, only stopped due to playing multiple games all the time. I do have one question I can’t find an answer to: when I look at the map, peoples camps have Vs on them, what does that mean? Google is failing me
---
I predict double xp starting this afternoon.
---
Probably doesn’t have to pay for it
---
Seriously?! I didn't even know that! Well thanks for sharing.

I am looking for a quad/ instigating explosive dragon!

I talk about this right at the start of the 500 atom ranger skin video. The hackers video was already done when that one was filmed. I am posting an update around the ranger skin video today and have pulled the old one. I didn't post the correction yesterday because I had this video going up and I figured I would wait to see what is said in the ITV.
---
Also what do you mean only do videos on bad stuff, what is the good stuff I am not covering? I covered mischief night and will cover P15/Winter Event. I am covering the game in general which happens to have a lot of bad stuff occurring as of late. If it was a bunch of good stuff I would be talking about that (as I did earlier this year when things were on the up and up).
---
Whelp, I won't be doing wastelanders if they make some bs pvp requirements. Game would be dead to me. I pvp in NW.
---
It means they are actively using their vending machine and have goods for sale.
---
You're welcome. We also seem them spawn in the daytime , but at night they are more visible
---
Thy means they have a vendor at their camps. Hovering over shows what they have for sale. Oh yea, player vending is also added!
---
Vendor. So you can go visit other players and buy stuff from their vending machines!
---
 I'm spec'ed for melee, but for select critters, I use heavy weapons.  
---
I have tank killer1 and stabilized3 equipped. 
---
 If you are thinking the numbers are low, its b/c I don't use performance enhancing foods, etc, so YMMV and all the standard disclaimers.
---
my experience:
---
Vampire 50/heavy barrel  is great for the heath regen, but not so much for damage.  IIRC, it only got about 12 per hit on the queen.  OTOH, it chews through her accompanying scorched.
---
AA 308 does about 20 per hit on the queen, and is faster.  Does very well against everything else
---
Resolute veteran or troubleshooters gatling do the most damage per hit against the queen, but with a slower fire rate.  Very effective against vertibots and cargobots.
---
During mischief night, I ran a non-legendary tactical gatling plasma.  Easy on ammo, great endurance, 34 per hit against the boss, slightly better numbers against the other bots.
---
is possible to set turrets to kill the high level dudes?
---
Besides ther handful of things noted here the game is exactly the same experience it was at launch.
---
Raids and burrows are group content as well. You can't do then solo
---
Thank you all for the replies, I had no idea they added vendors. It looks like I have a lot of catching up to do!
---
Marrying someone after only knowing then a year is a bad idea. Marrying someone at all is also generally a bad idea. Glhf
---
Same
---
Yeah, the sky was "falling."  Unfortunately, the later ones were all empty.
---
EMT,Healing hands ,tenderizer ,rad sponge ,team medic all are top tier perks ,if your team mates drop you for running charisma than they are just bad plain and simple
---
i average 4-5 wins a day and i always have a support player runnig hacking lockpicking emt tenderizer and rad sponge
---
20% increased damage for all of your team mates damage on a specific target is OP no matter how you view it its a free bloody mess for everyone except its better than bloody mess cause its 20% vs bloody messes 15%
---
Yeah, mine was disabled after the event as well. It only allows me to equip the gravestone, not the Jack O' Lantern in the Atomic Shop. On PS4.
---
They're not going to ban anyone, they need all the customers they can get at this point.
---
&gt;I've literally played about 65 NW matches in the last week and not seen that message once. You must be unlucky.
---
so just because you don't see it that means it doesn't exist
---
alright top tier argument
---
I’m not worried. I’ve 100% every Fallout and I plan on keeping that tradition, regardless of my dislike of the game.
---
How does putting white circles on the wall have anything to do with griefing?
---
Who?
---
What defines bad? Was Fallout 1st bad or good? I would just enjoy if you (Youtubers) be more neutral ...
---
Where? Do you mean the single room dungeon they advertised that was 5 minutes of content?
---
Oh no you mean the 3 quests they added to the game along with challenges that added a total of 45 minutes of gameplay.
---
Or could you mean the broken raid that isn't a raid but more a puzzle dungeon that hardly works and is draining and unrewarding?
---
Yeah theyve done tons of good content...
---
Unless I have used them previously I don’t cause it usually adds additional weight to the items that my stash can’t afford to lose
---
Can confirm.
---
Lost every damn thing on my armor mule doing this.
---
It worked dozens of other times moving other things, but crapped the bed moving my armors.  Figures.
---
It's always better together 😁
---
I used to find that cinema servers on gmod helped me a lot
---
I have a camp by the overseers camp. I sometimes put low level gear in the vendors for 1 or 2 caps.
---
Sometimes I'll mod them up massive like to grind the achievement a bit.
---
But most of the time I wait for people to enter the "best deals" room so I can trigger the trap in it. Which it seems need to be redesigned now as its not quite as lethal as it used to be.
---
Cool man.  Have a good day.
---
Sooo if it's something that anyone can benefit from and actually encourages the building of a diverse group instead of a team of lulzdpsdur players....then why get rid of it?
---
We will get wastlanders when we get fo 1st for free.
---
Lol they better try harder than that.they should do much much more to retain players lol
---
I get that, really I do! But when there's a complete *dearth* of achievement-based content in Adventure mode (and frankly, a dearth of updated content now the event is over) it just feels bad for that to be so punishing.
---
I am fine with never making it to like, Overseer 100 rewards or whatever, but a silly skeleton costume is my kind of jam. :( Also as someone who does like BR games, I really wish NW had better gun play...I don't find it very satisfying which makes the mode feel all the more like a grind for me. -\_-
---
You absolutely can sue.  All you need to do is enumerate your damages and find a lawyer willing to take the case.
---
Class action standing is another issue altogether, but get past the first step and worry about that later.
---
I think its hilarious. But in reality I have not seen this behavior on PS4. I wear my exclusive outfit and drop my awesome pay to win tent near events and have yet to be harassed by peasants in any way.
---
Bloodied still reigns supreme but a fair increase in Junkies (myself included) 
---
FFR and FSS are the Meta weapon prefixes amongst the majority.
---
It seems to be named "bow trap" in the data mine under the category "traps", maybe it is not the actual weapon?
---
&gt;DCDeacon
---
is Pete Hines i had to look it up as well
---
It doesn't but it's still highly believed. Tested this when I first got the game and so did my friend who introduced it to me, had no effect, jus the level of the enemy depending on how much xp you get.
---
Personally I think the whole legendary system needs a major rework and probably scrapping.
---
[](/nsswitch)Sure, just add a good anti cheat first. Otherwise don't even bother adding it to PC.
---
I love how you conveniently leave out all the stuff they did promise and give us (stash cap up to 800, vending machines, legendary trader, all the previous content updates like Pioneer Scouts and Nuclear Winter) but completely throw your hands up and resort to doomsaying because one of those content updates got delayed and it means Bethesda is always lying and screwing over the playerbase.
---
We get it, Bethesda bad.
---
My real hope with some sort of very public legal action would be to put more pressure on them to fix these issues, as it seems that all of the current public outcry is having little effect.  I think a lawsuit might make them at least somewhat less attractive to an investor, which, I do believe is Zenimax's primary concern at this point. 
---
Secondarily, I do think those who have paid for the game, and yes, those who paid for a FO1st subscription, should get some compensation for a game mode thats basically a crapshoot about whether you'll actually get to play or be killed nigh instantly.
---
Atleast thats honest
---
you can craft this or buy in atomic shop for only 500 atoms
---
Same doesnt work anymore since event ended. 
---
Xbox
---
So junkies still works? I was getting inconsistent numbers earlier. 50cal kept going from 107 damage to 94
---
Man, so much judgement here. While, yes the game has only been out nearly a year, some people can get to know each other enough to decide to get married in that time.
---
You don't have to know or live with the person for 5 years before deciding to get married? Man, do I need to pull out the "you millenials!" gun and shoot it everywhere? (BTW, I 'technically' am a millenial as well. Born in 1982).
---
Congrats to you, /u/erinnswaby . Hope the rest of your days are happy with your S.O.
---
I feel you. I bought the Tricentennial and PA versions of the game but I haven't sprung for Fallout 76 1st. They're not giving enough Atoms with the sub to entice me.
---
The burrows can be solo'ed.
---
The cause of death of ‘survival mode’ is rampantly duped legacy weapons, magic armors and aimbot. As long as you keep those out of the picture there can be many fun ways to play PVP in such a large and open environment of FO76. Capture the flag, team death match, Free For All, etc, anything is welcomed. Faction war is essentially team deathmatch and CTF combined.
---
Goodluck, every online co op pvp or single player game ive ever played had some sort of hackers/ cheaters. And never heard about one being sued for it.
---
It will be a recap of last weeks recap where they recapped patch 14 ( minus fallout 1st of course ).
---
For personally it’s still working, You not seeing a decrease from a perk (Adrenaline or gun fu) ?
---
Saying that, I haven’t been paying close attention. Il be certain to take a closer look when I’m next on.
---
People will 100% draw dicks over everything let’s be honest! It’s probably the first thing I’d do with the gun is draw a giant penis ngl😂 
---
Just have it so the paint doesn’t stay for long.. no harm done and everyone enjoys drawing dicks cmon🤷‍♂️ weve all seen superbad right?
---
Didn't someone nuke his camp some time back?
---
Seems par the course. I set one of mine as free for noobs as well stocked with a bunch of decorative camp plans (tables, chairs, etc) and some free ammo and aid products. Cleaned out by one high level player.
---
the only thing that matters is the xp boosting perks and foods and the level of the super mutant, intelligence doesnt give you any xp, if you can prove me wrong ill happily say your right
---
Go to settings and turn the music down. Fire up Pandora.
---
We've seen this suggested before and it has been passed along to the devs. I'll ping it again!
---
Just ask your mom if you can use her credit card
---
I’ve been waiting for them to release the t-60 Tesla suit that came out with Automatron. 🤞

 &gt; We've seen this suggested before and it has been passed along to the devs. I'll ping it again!
---
i don't want to get rid of it i want it nerfed make it 10% increased damage for 5 seconds or something
---
hell compare it to suppressor another 9 charisma perk it reduces ur damage done by 30% BUT it lasts only 2 seconds
---
in its current state tenderizer is too much
---
Mislabeled atomic shop items, just another day in Fallout 76. But dang though whoever in charge of Atomic Shop is seriously dropping the ball. I actually like the lights like that more.
---
And if you watch my Fallout 1st video I start off literally just showing what it does/gives you so you can form an opinion for yourself. After that I give my thoughts on it. My goal is to inform people first and then give my opinion after, not my job to convince you what to think. 
---
For your neutral argument does that apply to good things too? Like should I not give my opinion on Wastelanders (even if its overwhelmingly positive) just to stay neutral?
---
&gt; I don't have that perk, I do just fine without it.
---
you should try running tenderizer to see how fking broken it is
---
I wish fo76 had like an ingame board or market place so you could see what everyone was selling. I've got so excited seeing over a dozen weapons or armor for sale at a camp only to fast travel to it and find out its crafted junk and not legendaries I've stopped wasting the caps unless it's a camp right next where I'm at
---
Could even add a cargo bot tax to have it conveniently bought and delivered from afar
---
Had a similar experience with Halloween outfits.
---
In the run up to Halloween I filled a dedicated vending machine with outfits and labelled it 'Halloween Clothing'.  Everything was 10caps.  Plenty of people stopped by, some made a purchase some just browsed.  On 2 occasions I had very high level players (200+) clear it out completely!  One of them went straight to the nearest station and sold the lot ..... I went in after them and could see them all listed!
---
Not one of the 'lower' level players took more than one outfit and hat!
---
Working on the side quests I didn't finish and events I haven't done yet.
---
Hey, I met my now husband on 76 too! We just got married a few days ago. We were long distance at first then he moved in with me shortly after meeting.
---
Twinsies!
---
it's probably a cable trigger trap bow,pretty much like the pipe guns you find at raiders base, that way it wouldn't be hard for it to spawn a compound version instead of a recurve one like the one on the trailer
---
This is a known bug now, if you head into nuclear winter before going into adventure mode first, you will randomly complete some of your daily and if you do it on Tuesdays you’ll even complete some of your weeklies with no reward/compensation
---
Hey there! They should still be working after the event. Can you tell me what platform you are on?
---
Isn't it already? Even with all the armor boosting non-PA perks like Barbarian, Ironclad, and the AGI one, a backpack mod, and farming full combat armor you barely get as much DR as a suit of X-01 and you have to use up tons of perk slots and basically dedicate yourself to max STR and AGI melee build?
---
And you give up your armor when you do a radiation suit for nuked events since Rad X isn't enough and even if it was it suppresses all your mutations
---
Well i'am glad that at least some have not forgotten what they have done with Fallout Worst. If you look in the reddit today you might think the outcry is over. It'seems they are sitting this out, fortunately it won't be long before the fuck up the next time...
---
Waiting for the next inside the Vault, but i don't believe they will even mention it those cowards.
---
Very interesting and informative. I was unaware that the damage boost also applied to a creature’s overall health pool— that is to say, I was operating under the assumption that limbs and received damage in a system parallel to the creature’s overall health pool, and that the +50% boost was applied only against a limb’s health bar. And once a limb’s health bar became depleted, the boost was no longer applied (so long as that limb remained crippled).
---
Naturally, I fully agree with you on the utility that comes with crippling the limbs of a the SBQ and other boss-creatures. Against all other creatures though, the question comes to mind of “how much overmatch is too much overmatch?” But then, I suppose that question applies to every other melee boosting effect.

---
 &gt; Hey there! They should still be working after the event. Can you tell me what platform you are on?
---
Oh yeah, my bad. The loot is terrible though.
---
https://youtu.be/F9OmHxl-hEs with this build I’m killing the same super mutants and getting less then half of the experience, there is no food combination that can give you +120% bonus exp. Even easier then watching my other videos kill super mutant then eat Berry mentats and kill another one of the same lvl. I’m really sorry that Todd lied again 😐. Let me know your results if you decide to test it.
---
Well, yeah...but I want to share with those visiting my camp. :-)
---
This
---
It happens even if you don't play NW. Just complain to support and they give the missing atoms back.
---
Ill probably have to attempt solo as I’m the only one who even plays this game anymore or holds any interest for it. Any friends I had that did quit playing it a week or two after it came out
---
I sell mine as-is. However, I am willing to mod for a price if asked.
---
Gotta get that boot scum deep into the tastebuds.
---
I haven’t seen any conclusive reports on the bug happening any other way than how I described, but it possibly could, I just cannot comment on that! 
---
However if you do complain to support and manage to get a response from them, I’m sure they’ll probably just give you the atoms tbh.. 
---
(That shouldn’t have to be a work around tho!)
---
&gt; a promise of what they could be though. Either buy them for what they are right now, or wait and buy them when and if that promise
---
Yes, unfortunately that doesn't work either with those new scams. You can buy a game right now as it is and they already planned out to turn it in a scam a few months later. See CoD BO4 as example. Sell the game now and wait with the monetization until the review cycle and most sells are over. This is a fraud.
---
Yes, neutral on all things! JuiceHead, I know I see your vídeos, but I see many many other Youtubers and I cant tell you all apart because. I dont know if you are neutral or not because I cant pinpoint your vídeos... And I cant go Watch it Now. Im talking about general YouTube not you specificaly so dont take it personaly.
---
At that point it becomes like every other nerfed thing in gaming history....why even run it at all? Eventually why not just make vanilla levelless perkless characters that can only use a generic weapon that's equal to everything else? That way you cant cry that you only died because it's unfair -insert random reason- is broken and needs nerfed
---
as a dude that definitely has had serious depression in the past, and struggle with it regularly... I THOROUGHLY enjoy fo76. but have started playing outer worlds. and I seem to be happier because I can pause it, there isn't pressure to accomplish certain things daily... sometimes I turn the game on, do a few tinkers, reassess which quest I'm about to work on, and might leave it paused whole I do other stuff to come back to it and make some progress sneaking around and head-popping MFs before they know where I am. I'm big into the fallout universe, but 76 isn't quite my ideal speed
---
Are you on pc?
---
Awesome. Congrats.
---
Well my heroin dealer also need to have money so i guess everything he does is ok then?
---
6. Pretty fucking clear, bud. 
---
7. It is. Just sound it out. You’ve got all day.
---
20% damage for all of ur team mates for 10 seconds is broken
---
hell i would be happy for them to remove the perk system from NW all together
---
Solid idea. We should have more events in general. Loved the Halloween stuff.
---
It could be neat, but licensing songs can be expensive and annoying.  That said, they might be able to pull at least some public domain songs together to play them.
---
Same for me. I bought the E3 atoms bundle as a reward for the good wild appalachia dlc to support the game. I'dont buy out of FOMO or some other psychological bullshit. I spend only money if the developer deserves it. 
---
Unfortunately i should have never bought that boundle, silly me...
---
Metal.
---
There’s like one for each slot (excepting Prime), and they all have a description. It’s not the freaking Lament Configuration.
---
Gotcha.
---
I have just one query . wanna nuka cranberry?
---
Dude that's an awesome idea good luck brother and have fun hunting with others.
---
I’m level 175 and I would have cleaned you out too, but for different reasons than you think. I don’t need stimpaks or radaway, got hundreds. Don’t need caps either, max caped on 4 characters. But I would take them to hand out to other low level players that I meet. Then throw the rest into the overseers case at flatwoods. Using the logic that you obviously don’t need them if you are giving them away free.
---
I'm on PC and after reading this post I went to go check and mine is also unavailable to be used.
---
Nope. I shot one it didn't blow.
---
If you put something out for free that has value don't be surprised when someone takes it
---
Last night I participated in three of them.  Seems like its slowly coming back.
---
Exactly! My second character turned out so much better.
---
I have a tse lmg i got for lile 1500 caps when lmgs were flaming garbage piles lmao, def the coolest gun in the game , only problem is ammo, you have to,buy because crafting it produces too little of a yield
---
BE flamer ? Also caps or trades
---
Same happened to me today. 40 atom, gone.
---
I bet youre great at parties. Jesus go have a beer or something
---
Imagine if these were already in the game and they were called workshops.
---
you have a BE flamer or are you asking if i have one?
---
Why aren't you dropping them?
---
I wanna buy. Sorry for confusion
---
I love it!
---
do you have legacy or sentinels to trade for it?
---
This is why I never do The Messenger in the Ash Heap.
---
Apart from that one occasion when he was stuck in a similar pit but it was promptly joined by a neverending spawn of suicidal possums - which I somehow found hilarious - I know that there is only frustration down that road.
---
I went through about 3 weeks of auto completed challenges without playing NW at all. I managed to get pretty much all of them back, bar the odd 20 here or there that I couldn't be bothered to argue about.
---
Every stat has a really strong perk that costs 9, and you can't take them all.  Running Tenderizer means they're giving up on something else in their build, and I don't see what's so problematic about a perk that encourages teamwork in a team-based game mode.
---
Reject modernity , return to the two shot explosive
---
NP.
---
I can't complain about the loot.  I'm a melee player.  I modded the Gutter to add electrical damage -it is my backup weapon in case my vampire switchblade breaks.
---
Yeah bloodied and junkies are definitely top tier paired with explosive or faster fire rate. Runner up I’d say is probably anti-armor and vampire with the same secondary effects. 
---
It’s hard to beat bloodied cause there’s so many perks and bonuses that synergize with it, I hope they introduce some other perks or mutations that do this for other builds in the future.
---
Fair enough, it definitely seems like you had a more severe case of this glitch than anyone else I’ve seen.. I should hope you’d get your 3 weeks of atoms back! I’d be so pissed, 80% of my playtime nowadays is atom grinding
---
They need to post a warning when leaving NW to reboot the game before playing Adventure if they're not going to fix this shit. This bug is old.
---
I mean, it can be frustrating when you encounter a single generic enemy and get your ass kicked without much of a chance. That's why a tough encounter with multiple enemies is more fun than a tough encounter with a single or small number. I like firefights, like I said, but bullet sponges feel like progress in the battle is excruciatingly slow.
---
Drawing/writing offensive things.
---
OP makes a post about a purchase log, gets your reply in minutes. Other players and myself asking why we havent heard anything on the status of an anti-cheat for pc or anything about the rampant cheating on pc and we go ignored. Why aren't we allowed to get an answer?
---
does it work on dog food?
---
I got a good haul when i went there last night for the daily challenge - its a feature i can get behind :)  
---
Sadly one of the drops then continued to follow me around the rest of the world.
---
Silence means they don't have a workable plan to prevent or punish cheaters. Most likely all their cognizant resources are working on gimmicks to make them a few more bucks.
---
If you don't like the game as it is, leave now. This shit ISN'T going to get better.
---
Lets not and say we did
---
So if my opinion is negative, then it is no longer an opinion?
---
I fear you're right.
---
Good idea!
---
Halloween sound effects even. Most of the ambient noise  could come from public domain... cat's meow, creaky doors, etc.
---
Sadly no
---
Vault raids and plan hunting
---
Weirdly enough it was 3 weeks, then never again, but the bugs clearly affected other players. Ah well, luck of the draw I guess!
---
Yeah I get that. The engine really isn't built for a shooter. There is no bullet drop or travel time so sniper builds are OP. But it does have charm to it.
---
I will be frank. My team that I play NW with, pretty much dominates the mode. We win almost every match. We play for relaxation because we can just chill and mess around. The few times we have to put effort in is when we fight aimboters. Outright hackers we usually try to nuke(some teleport out of the nuke zone but we try anyways).
---
I think the thing that keeps us playing is eachother and the jokes and fun we have together rather than the mode being really good.
---
I want them to improve the mode and add events. Like for a weekend there could be something like scorchbeast mania where scorchbeasts spawn throughout the game from the start rather than just at the end. Or there could be 26 vs. 26 player games for a couple of days.
---
Nice way to be negative and bitter I downvoted 🙄
---
They started dropping on private servers on pc to avoid cheaters one-shotting the queen
---
I know he was there before the event so I'm guessing he's gone back 👍
---
Good idea.
---
&gt;Running Tenderizer means they're giving up on something else in their build
---
if this was a solo mode maybe ,but you can have someone in the back tag the enemies and have the dps kill them ez 
---
&gt;I don't see what's so problematic about a perk that encourages teamwork in a team-based game mode.
---
nothing OP about a perk that increases the damage taken by someone by 20% for all of your team mates  for 10 seconds(bloody mess for comparison gives only 15%) 
---
suppressor another 9 points charisma perk reduces the enemy damage by 30% but only lasts 2 seconds
---
tenderizer does too much
---
it should be 10% damage maybe for 2  seconds max
---
Exactly, and to many STDS to be messing around as well
---
Yeah that’s wierd isn’t it a positive comment ?
---
power corrupts, nothing new
---
Yeah. Idk why people are offended by THAT of all things.
---
This. 1000000 times this. We need an alternate advancement system. I'm at 180+ and its just pointless.
---
My guess is he’s probably no longer in game.. but I guess if we’ll find him anywhere it’ll be at Freddy fears!
---
This is exactly why I don't like most other high levels. They're greedy, selfish, and think they're better than everyone else. But they aren't. 
---
In my eyes, "better than everyone" is: giving stuff away to new people for free. Being nice to everyone. Not stealing from new players. And other nice stuff.
---
Don't be like the typical level 50+ players. Be like this guy. Be like the people who helped me level up and launch a nuke. Be NICE.
---
Anti armor,  Junkies,  Furious and the king , bloodied
---
The only thing that I would consider a substantial change since you last played would be the increase in the number of bugs.
---
Best f76 story ever, and what makes it even better is the people doing it were high level players lol. People who legitimately enjoyed the game and helping out lower level players, and they actually did give him free stuff and helped him quest if I remember right, then nuked his camp right after. It's v rare to find both sides of the player population in one encounter, Pete Hines should consider himself blessed
---
What if I don’t use bloodied or junkies? Just aa and furious?
---
I saw him last night and wondered the same thing! Hadn't seen him before the event but didn't know if that was his usual hangout
---
If you read the comments literally all platforms are having issues
---
I think I already have that in there, but thanks for making sure it was there 👍🏻
---
I haven’t tried for damage numbers yet, my one buddy said it pushes close to 1000 without drugs/alcohol so I wanted to give it a try (game gets repetitive with handmades/fixers).
---
That sucks, because it is a really good idea and we need one.
---
Ok, thanks. I think we'll still benefit from it but thanks for informing me about that
---
I guess so
---
Shotguns primarily excel at vats builds since each of their pellets count as a hit when using four leaf clover meaning you can get a full crit bar nearly every other shot. They also have great utility with enforcer along with vampire and medics legendary effects due to this same mechanic. For anything else, yeah they are pretty much outclassed by rifles since their damage drops off quickly especially when using a suppressor.
---
I have a TSE Lever and a TSE RW Gatling gun and I love them you have to take into consideration everything Anti Armor does less damage, Bloodied you always have to be low health, Junkies you have to have addictions with side effects, and I suppose the only best thing to TSE with high health build would be Vampire but it does less damage
---
Lmao, Salt. 
---
Thx
---
My mom and stepdad got married after dating for only 3 weeks.  They have now been married for 35 years or so.
---
It has been in the game for 4 months and has been reported many, many times.
---
You guys should be well past investigation at this point.
---
Gonna give you a list of things you missed. This is a copy paste message and may not be applicable to the questions asked. Reply and I'll go into detail on things if you want
---
March is when they actually started improving the game, from Nov-Feb it was only bug fixes and a boring world. Not listing things in any order, you missed:
---
three weeklong holiday events with camp and cosmetic rewards (minor addition)
---
alcohol crafting with daily quests (minor addition) 
---
a camera for taking quicker pictures (minor addition)
---
New faction and questline with backpack reward (large addition)
---
Sheepsquatch questline with unique weapon reward and side quests, two repeatable events (major addition)
---
Small dungeon with quest (small addition)
---
Large dungeon with repeatable event (large addition)
---
Player Vending Machines (small addition)
---
Nuclear Winter game mode with 51 other players in a battle Royale scenario with special cosmetic rewards (major addition)
---
Special vendor that gives random Legendaries in exchange for other Legendaries (small addition)
---
Vault Raid which gives guaranteed armor rewards with unique set bonuses (major addition)
---
Display cases for your camp which allows you to place items so visitors can view them (minor addition)
---
Basically I put either small, large, or major for what these updates added to the game. However, that's only in terms of content. For example I would say player vending and the legendary vendor were bigger adds than say vault raids or the Arktos Pharma dungeon. Still a buggy game though, but that's what Bethesda is. Wastelanders will be like a chapter 2 with a supposedly different feel but it's coming out early next year
---
Can u haves Vampires TSE weapons?
---
No only vampire or TSE that would be too OP 😂
---
he was there at least a week or so before the event....at least for me
---
That's nice, with two people's income you should be able to afford Fallout 1st now.
---
Naw, they helped create this atmosphere with their silence on important issues for a year but their open embracing of posts like the shit in bags left on peoples bed post.
---
Nope. Only one or the other. But Explosive can be applied to both of them
---
Ah ok. Yeah, I've been looking for people to do the newish content with
---
Possibly a dumb question about Junkie build; do you have to keep taking loads of the drugs you're addicted to to get the best out of the build? If so does that mean you have to always have loads of meds on you?
---
They have utterly failed at that job for a year
---
So is TSE better or VE
---
I love it, and I want in.
---
Of course they do we are all aware of this but there taking it too a whole new level
---
Not really. Just get addicted to drugs that have negative effects unrelated to your build
---
Furious FFR would be quite a nice combination.  Furious is almost as good as junkies, not even taking into account the withdrawal effects from junkies (which can be minimized anyway).
---
Thrown on reload speed, and I think you're about maxed out on shiny.
---
I never noticed he must have been put in after the last update
---
Nighttime NW would be the balls
---
Or limit sales of a given item.
---
Kingdom of Loathing has a system like this for mall stores, you can set any item in the store to a max of x/per day sales, and it lets you run special deals like selling good items ridiculously cheap without just being cleaned out by one player.
---
Nice Try Todd lol.  Kidding, Congrats
---
Yeah I’d say it was part of the update I don’t think he was there before that
---
I'm gonna do this, but I'm gonna be sure to set traps for high levels. I'll have a little set of gates with 
---
"free stuff" &lt;low levels&lt; 
---
"Free stuff" &gt;high levels (leave some stuff for lower level players)&gt; 
---
A higher level player would go into the high level gate, bc they have no use for low level stuff. 
---
And when they do, 20 radiation traps and 10 flame traps would trigger, and the electric door would shut behind them, disabling their exit, promptly killing them and leaving them with very high radiation. The low level door would also shut, preventing them from returning for the free loot. I will be sure to leave them a message saying:
---
"Don't. Be. Greedy. Lower level players need items, you don't. Don't ever return to my camp:
---
Berserkers should work with weightless armor imo
---
I can't remember if you lose the damage bonus when you take chems you're addicted to
---
I should be at least 1000 atoms richer by now
---
My buddy has 3* furious explosive 10mm smg, i forget the 3rd effect but is that as powerful as it sounds or no
---
You dont.
---
Ahh yes the whiny kids rebuttal
---
Unyeilding so you get more agility which affects sneak, and the other legendary effect which just plain out increases your sneak, but it’s a secondary or third legendary effect
---
This should be a thing
---
Honestly, it's hard to say. TSE does more raw damage but they're more inaccurate and on most guns they end up breaking quicke. VE gives you health regen on top of doing higher damage, but they do less raw damage than TSE.
---
It just comes down to preference, tbh. Though I can say with confidence that a TSE Minigun triumphs all other miniguns.
---
If you have a boy, you have to name him pip!
---
I've spent money...no.1, buying it, no.2 buying atom packs on special for the atoms and the special costumes that come with it. I refuse to pay for "first" as my thinking is its a "privilege" expense that I shouldn't have to pay for. Nonetheless ,if I visit a CAMP that is owned by a lower player, I always drop junk, food and water. I also give away weapons and armour. I've also visited vault 76 entrance to give level 1-3 level players a crafted weapon and armour set to double durability at level 1. Some run away, but most catch on and take it with huge gratitude. Once you reach a high level, the amount of satisfaction I get from this simple act is huge.
---
Aw man that sucks, but at least if it happens again you should be able to get them back. I have a lot of critical stuff to say about Beth right now, but I can't fault their customer support, they have fixed any issues i have had with atoms in a matter of hours.
---
So you aren't playing the game, and haven't been for a long time, and you aren't paying them money for Fallout first.   There's another group out there who has been playing since launch, has regularly spent money on micro transactions since then, and is currently paying them monthly for a subscription. It doesn't take a genius to see who they are going to listen to.
---
&gt; Sadly one of the drops then continued to follow me around the rest of the world.
---
Love it when that happens. Everywhere you go, no matter what you're doing and where it is, that box is there. Watching you.
---
_Waiting._
---
2 shot should be brought from +25% to +50% dmg. Its negative side eeffect is it doesn't work in vats because of the spread
---
I had one and sold it for my friend for like 11k and I wanna cry now
---
New Fallout 1st Feature - Gain Double XP for a weekend once a month!
---
I just feel like this is going to happen.
---
I assume we will get different maps on the future. But I agree with the weather and time of day and the box spawning. I've played enough I know where the boxes spawn, so it does provide players with an advantage over newer player.
---
Haha u start off with saying ur just camping around in nw and then criticize the game mode like try playing it how your suppose to me and others I play with play it almost every day and it's pretty fun focus on getting into fire fights not just surviving and the loot drops r random its not the same places everytime and y would they put more stuff in the empty fields they want u to get into fights with people so they put more loot in certain areas
---
Well I mean, I'm on PS4 and I'm not having an issue with the Jack-O-Bag. I mean, It's not showing up in the Atom Shop for me too, but it still shows up when I drop stuff
---
The content that was datamined on the last dome turned one of the most difficult challenges in the game into something that was commonly known and everyone had in three days.
---
It would have taken a dedicated player months and months to solve that problem otherwise.
---
By datamining it they destroyed the actual challenge involved as well as the prestige finding it otherwise should have awarded.
---
Trading, PvP and legendary runs. Haven’t even touched the vault and I am pushing lvl 170. We need more endgame content for sure! Patience is a virtue!
---
Unyielding(Prefix) with the “Become harder to detect while sneaking”(affix) and preferably Action Point Refresh Speed(affix).
---
Low health with full unyielding boosts your agility massively(Agility is directly tied to your ability to sneak) if you’re going for stealth and sneaking then having the unyielding with become harder to detect while sneaking on every piece in an armor set would be ideal for this purpose.
---
Ideally shrouded wood armor but tbh the type of armor it is doesn’t matter with these particular effects on it and having a higher DR/ER choice would be optimal.
---
Entitlement runs rampant in 76. 
---
You're either a 1st sub and want more free shit. 
---
Or you're not and think everything should be free. 
---
There's very few people here who find an objective balance.
---
The 1st subscription doesn't really have any relation to the NW mode though so any costs there could never be considered. Also NW is basically a free add on mode to an existing game. The majority of early buyers would have never even known this mode was going to be added and by the time it was added the game was regularly available around $20 price point. It sucks they have a broken hacked mess of a mode, but the actual damages would be incredibly low.
---
I'm verklempt
---
Even as a level 73 if I saw that I'd do what the low level did (stims are an utter pain for me) but I wouldn't take it all, if the owner was nearby I'd drop some extra stuff, ammo and some modded weaponry built there and then to give to lower levels 
---
As for the high levels, that plain selfish but what can you do? Wish you could have a cap on what level you need to be to get it free or discounted - now actually theres an idea
---
all of these would make nuclear winter (which i already love) absolutely amazing, the shifting time of day and off map safe zones especially
---
I have a similar gun can’t remember my third it was something pointless but it’s essentially my legendary tagging weapon. Not enough damage to really take anything out. But enough area damage to make sure my hits count.
---
Game desperately needs content so bad .
---
Sorry, not quite following you. How has it been turned into a scam?
---
It amuses me the real Frank Castle wouldn't be in here crying about being killed in pvp.
---
What about those effects on a heavy gun like lmg or 50 cal
---
Looks almost exactly like the Subtle Calamity from Destiny 2
---
If you are going full out sneak and want maximum allowable...
---
Wood: Shroud, Harder to detect while sneaking, 
---
This allows for a few variations:  you could find a bolstering, vanguards, or unyielding version of said wooden armor.  I advise whichever suits your build best.  
---
Also, the minor, AP refresh or + 1 agility.  
---
I like full health builds, so:
---
Wooden: Shrouded, Harder to detect while sneaking, vanguards, +1 agility would be the sweet spot.  
---
Some people say wooden armor defense is terrible... In which case you can find any armor piece with the above stats.  
---
Wood, unlike all the other types, allows for the shrouded modification and is just supremely sneaky.
---
Watch all the 1st haters come out of the wood work to call subscribers entitled for wanting more free stuff.....
---
Meanwhile they've been doing the same thing since launch. 
---
*DISCLAIMER* not a subscriber
---
if the only thing you got is personal attacks then thats pretty sad imo
---
Cause i like raw dmg, but everyone knows DPS is the name of any online rpg and mmo
---
I see your point, but I don’t find the situation to be so serious as you have presented it. It’s a bit much.
---
This is a pretty good idea. They probably make it a Fallout 1st subscriber exclusive and charge an additional $30 a month to have access to the radio in order to cover licensing fees
---
You're a good dude. I've also dropped at least extra .38 ammo or basic weaps or armor because someone gave me something at level 10 that changed my game.  
---
What I was hoping to get at though, is if a double xp weekend got you back to playing, it still woudn't make bethesda any more actual money, right?  Like, you wouldn't say "oooh double xp, while im here I should go buy that thing from the atom shop" right?
---
The pods are also supposed to bloom when Heart of the Swamp spawns.
---
That's just stupid. 
---
You're upset that something you bought didn't include something that was never supposed to be included?
---
Ficking consumers.
---
I'd kind of like them to add an extremely cheap throwing weapon like a rock. Not altogether sure what you'd make it out of, if anything.  Concrete is too rare/expensive.  
---
Has anyone tried using the slag from the Camden Park challenges as a thrown weapon? Maybe that's it: anyone can make a lump of slag from a single piece of steel slag.
---
Shotguns definitely have great niche uses. For the Meltdown raid, I've actually settled on using a Junkie's Explosive pump shotgun for the entire mission.
---
Forget about using stealth so no need for a suppressor - the extra range helps prevent damage fall off but most fights are up close and personal anyway.
---
that would be a nice surprise
---
Id be happy with a few more maps and some map rotation.  Can we get a Watoga map please?
---
I have collected blooms in the middle of the day and when Heart of the Swamp is not running. I think the time of day and Heart of the Swamp are not factors.
---
Are you planning on playing at full health? 
---
If so I’d recommend blocker over barbarian.
---
&gt; Eventually why not just make vanilla levelless perkless characters that can only use a generic weapon that's equal to everything else
---
isn't that the point of PVP for the better skilled player to win not who min maxed the best?
---
Ive read your suggestions and have come to the conclusion that im going to need a lot more caps for any of these. I already have half a set of unyielding so i guess i can go full bloodied build if i try hard enough. Thanks for all the suggestions
---
Met my wife in a skyrim group six years ago. Never have I been happier. Congratulations!
---
&gt;  that was never supposed to be included
---
do you believe everything you read on the internets? :)
---
Hey Ladydevvan,  I’m on Xbox and it doesn’t allow me to select  an option to equip the loot bag while I’m viewing it in atomic shop
---
It depends, I'm a Fallout player from the beginning, so I love collecting. I've pretty much got every power armour skin for every type of power armour, you know....just in case I want a change 😉. So I might buy more, if I see one that takes my fancy. What's seriously needed is more military suits, like the bomber jacket one. I'd spend serious money for a new good clean outfit!
---
Hoping for some tidbits about P15...
---
One of the biggest complaints about the game is a lack of content.
---
Yet the community has in the past circumvented the content by essentially cheating the answers up through datamining.
---
How is that not serious in your book?
---
It was easier to get stuff in a single player game?! How completely unexpected.  /s
---
Yea but that's not at all like I mentioned. The only similarity is you can PvP in them, that's literally it. Talk about apples to oranges...
---
Data mined or not, there’s still a vast majority of people who don’t pay attention to that stuff but see others wearing it and ask and then it gets leaked that way as well.
---
I use to love my TSE handmade until i branched out. I use a VE and Furious or Instigating now. The Furious and Instigating seem quite a bit better. The VE is hardly weaker than the TSE.
---
Nothing beats the feeling of jumping out of my Strangler Heart PA, looking at it and thinking "I earned this through grinding/hardwork" I hope that one day they can put in place a system that brings about that sense of accomplishment when it comes to my weapons. Getting a really good 3 star at random is a really good feeling, but for me, personally, it can never beat that self satisfaction. I'm not asking for a legendary system that makes it easy to get god rolls, the process should take a considerable amount of time, but there should be a process. All those 3 star rolls at the purveyor, and however many you do it never brings you closer to your desired weapon, it's just random. Maybe that's why I'm still playing this game a year in? Maybe it's the fact it's so hard to obtain a god roll ourselves that keeps me coming back.
---
I mean if i saw free stuff for high levels then yeah i would go in. Doesn't mean id take everything
---
So go for a VE?
---
Haha too kind :)
---
duuuude that's sick
---
the statistics that people probably don't even care....
---
My combat rifle explosive  dose 99 without demolition on after applying the 5 star card (+60% more damage) I get it to 109 
---
That's not 60%  that's 10%  I should be getting around 158 out of it
---
*This* is why, no matter what happens, Fallout 76 will never die. Greatest community I’ve ever known.
---
Naw bud.  What's sad is you got played by someone who did the research and found a way to make their team better using a perk which requires them to gimp their own solo play and instead of finding a counter or using your newfound knowledge of how powerful playing as a team is (you know, as the game mode is intended to be played) you just came in here and started crying NERF like a 5 year old.  Adapt and overcome, pvp isnt always a fair fight nor is it always apples to apples, especially if you're not playing the mode as it's designed to be played.
---
I haven't seen anyone flaunting it...
---
I mean if you think someone Robot/Mothman dancing is flaunting it...or if I use one of the FO 1st icons is flaunting it...
---
What I *have* seen is people randomly running up to me in the NW Lobby or outside Whitesprings - see my Ranger outfit, and do a puke emote over and over again....
---
I have this problem too.  I wish that changes could be slipped in with out data mining being able to find them.  Then when every patch hits some players will travel certain areas to see if something is different.  People would post discoveries here and others would jump in and try to figure out if one change leads to anything else.
---
I have a furious explosive mini gun and it’s a beast. Definitely does a lot of damage when you stack it all up. A friend runs a .50cal explosive and it seems to do some serious damage. The only thing is they both are strong but at a greatly increased ammo cost essentially.
---
People are actually lying about a class war existing? Even if you sub monthly it’s an hours pay at minimum wage, literally. Cheaper if you pay for a year. You don’t need to be rich to have the sub.
---
NukaNog for that Christmas glow
---
remindme! 180 days
---
What paintball gun?
---
10 minutes seems excessive.
---
I've played a ton over the last 5 days or so to get the 14,000XP reward and sometimes I'll load into the lobby and seconds later we're at the deployment screen.
---
Once I'm in the lobby it's never more than a few minutes before match begins
---
Yes that is right, there is no war. Wink Wink* Perhaps we start a Purge day to let the peasants focus on killing each other instead of us elites?
---
Fake... No.
---
Real, yes.
---
My b/f and I (both over lvl 300) are working on a scavenger hunt -- plan is to head out one session using only weapons we pick up (no Legendaries) and see who can find the most items on the list. 
---
Other than that, as a shotgunner my endgame is the same it's been from day one: loot plastic.
---
I also still like events, especially since the introduction of public events improvements, dropping nukes, and more recently completing atom challenges.
---
When Nuka quantum paint came out and the steps were leaked, we all followed the steps and acquired the item. 
---
Boom, new content enjoyed ✔️
---
That key was public loot too, so it wasn’t so easy to get it once everyone knew. 
---
I don’t see a problem with how that all went down. 
---
If they release a new one, that’ll be just as good. 
---
I think you’re just in a whole other headspace about this. I can’t level with you.
---
Its the thirstiest time of the year
---
So do you think legendaries r better on some guns than others? and should I keep my TSE 50 cal?
---
I just run 5 pieces of chameleon armour, since I haven't gotten lucky with getting Wood or Harder to Detect Legendaries. 
---
Can't personally say if it's better or worse than other Legendary effects though.
---
In CoD or Battlefield etc etc this is an RPG with a pvp mode tacked on it's very much about build/gear/ and team mechanics
---
Ok. Thanks
---
What would stop people from using mules or alts to go clear out vending machines?
---
Wanna Nuka-Cola Cranberry ?
---
yeah some of us are good people
---
I was mearly quoting the article
---
So there are a few weapons and armours that are unobtainable in game except for certain exploits used to get these weapons from the “dev room” as it’s known. The paintball gun was one of them.. a little bolt rifle that shot white paintballs and could even paint junk white! 
---
Recently anyone who had this weapon found it had been given 200+ to its carry weight.. basically trolling those people who have it!
---
What I think Bethesda should do is just give us the bloody weapon! 😡😡
---
And you can take control of them. The territory control feature you bring up is already here.
---
I sense sarcasm.
---
The regular white lights used to do this too. I'd actually forgotten about that so assuming they fixed it but somehow ported the error over in the red and white ones.
---
maybee you're wearing off on him.  good hunting
---
Did it?
---
i'd just be happy if it were possible to play the flatwoods map again. we only have two maps, making it a random 50/50 chance which one you play would be nice.
---
More and more of us emerging. Congratulations 🎉
---
Honestly yeah. Especially with the 50 cal. I wouldn't sweat the explosive to much, I personally like the explosive but its not much of a buff.
---
I'm nearly unstoppable with the VE handmade. It heals me faster than anything can kill me and the damage great. I still die in the raid when i'm swarmed with cave crickets but thats really it.
---
You mean like, Raiders, and Settlers? Kind of like... what Wastelanders will have?
---
Its region based. So if your region is not as populated then less servers. I wish you could go to the other regions without needing a vpn.
---
Huh, well that's something I've never heard of until right now. The only unobtainable gun that I knew of was the Laser Musket.
---
The topic is the subscription. New content has come out via the subscription this week.
---
There's still some undiscovered content related to the connection between The Burrows, The Enclave's Whitespring Bunker, and the Brotherood. I was never able to figure it out myself, but there are clues pointing to Crevasse Dam and Mosstown. Most people wrote off The Burrows as a 10 minute quest, but there was more to it than that. I reached a dead end when following the clues, unfortunately.
---
I think Fortnite tried to sue a 14 year old over cheating/hacks.
---
Don't think it worked though.
---
Yeah once the cat is out of the bag its out, which is exactly why datamining shortens the lifespan of the content.
---
The week it was leaked it was like a plague of locusts over at the domes. And then after that nothing, the gig was up.
---
In most faction war games, even a PvE player can contribute. Usually by farming for mats, but sometimes there's boss mobs that buff your faction when you kill them.
---
What about the Statues and such?
---
It's not faction related in any way.
---
It’s laggy especially during events, my god the frames were so low when hundreds of mole rats came.
---
Right! Community treasure hunts are way more fun and engaging than datamined instant gratification.
---
It's not. There's nothing down there really.
---
"Gaming journalism" is hot garbage. You can safely ignore all of it.
---
Once I'm in the lobby it's about 3 minutes maximum but finding a game is what takes ages. It nearly 15 mins before I'm actually playing the game sometimes. I'll admit not all the time this happens but it's more often than not. It makes it an unappealing game mode to play.
---
Yes that is one of them too! People have also obtained wooden masks and even the rare faschnat masks before faschnat even came out! People think that’s the real reason Bethesda didn’t make them drop during the event.. just “said” they did
---
Said the same thing &amp; no one listened. Hope you get some traction.
---
&gt;The cause of death of ‘survival mode’ is rampantly duped legacy weapons, magic armors and aimbot. 
---
Duping is why PVP is broken  in this game. You will never convince me that Bethesda ever intended for people to be walking around in full sets of Sentinel Assassins armor.   Without duping, I doubt that would even be possible. 
---
Bethesda needs to close  off all avenues to duping, then raise the max weapon level  and armor levels up to level 80,  thus making all current God tier  gear obsolete.
---
I have a VE LMG and found that I can toe to toe tank the ISS with it in just excavator armor. It's healing effect is unreal. Enjoy!
---
yut I don't look at signs either.  if items are free, and I actually need them I won't take more that 2.
---
Oh, I thought they were just taking whatever was free. I shall adjust my prices accordingly
---
The same damage is reflected in the damage indicators in combat. Now you've got me curious, though. I wonder if something is wrong with Bloodied, Adrenal, or both?
---
If you want to kill someone in a workshop, at least claim the workshop.
---
The way that went down is literally the problem. That content was enjoyed, it was devoured when it should have been discovered over time through community effort and savored.
---
Then heart of the swamp just ran or someone just completed the quest.  They dont "unbloom" you have to pick the flower before a pod will respawn in its place.
---
We drop nearly every day. Sometimes several in a row.
---
Why don't you, I dunno, drop some yourself?
---
Jesus, you got any pics of this stuff? Wooden masks sound pretty interesting
---
How do you know they are new players and not just alt characters?
---
They nerfed food builds too??? 😂
---
We’ve reached the agree to disagree moment.
---
I would like to see this idea implemented in the vending machine.   I have had some low level but decent legendary items drop in the forest region.  
---
I would love to put a 3* level 5 item up for sale at 300 caps but I know if I do that higher level visitors would buy it up just for the script.  Not saying that a level 5 to 15 wouldn't do the same but at least I would know that it was bought by a low level and that, either way, they are being helped by it. 
---
Other than this, I dont have the stash space to carry  low level items.  Typically I will just craft new items for a low level and max out the mods then just give it to them.  
---
What we really need is a second popup store, like the lemonade stand, with it's own stash limits, say 150 or so, that we can plunk down in another area of the map.
---
Yes, cause you need to leave the world in order to get on said mule and even then I've seen mules at somewhat mid levels so
---
Would be nice though if they decreased some of the budget cost for certain items, I want my camp to look nice but damn that Nuka Cola billboard takes up so much space.
---
I have had BoS versus Enclave fights happen for literally hours over power plants.
---
They absolutely can be faction related in every way.
---
Congrats!
---
Yea so thats what i do in fo76 now is incite violence through class war. It makes the game fun and typically i can get pvp that way.
---
Though I'm not able to prime mine yet, the .308 ultracite batches are much bigger than standard .308. So that might be one time priming makes sense.
---
I don’t unfortunately, however there’s a good YouTuber I can recommend where I learnt all this information from.. he has also showcased many of the items before on his channel.. his name is: SinisterHand
---
I offer custom quests to strangers and grant rewards. 
---
Has anyone met the Kingdom of Gadlantis on PC?
---
just thought of this.  we could put all the freebies in one vendor and only power that vendor when a new player comes up to the stand.  good hunting yall
---
I didn't say anything about requirements so that's a different conversation. This idea was a zone you can opt to go in and take over with your teammates or not.
---
I was going to say the same thing, but you're right. With the mid-20th century music already in the game, finding more in the public domain would be perfectly manageable.
---
I would love to buy all the recipes from him, my dream in this game is a bar tender.
---
You're marrying a person you only known at most a year?
---
Who knows how long you actually starting seeing each and/or living with each other.
---
Okay, you in my eyes are part of the problem then.
---
I genuinely wish people like you would stop supporting the ruining of content in this game via metagaming.
---
It's one of the reasons why I paid for Fallout 1st as I'm able to really help out lower levels now utilising it and I do same with the weaponry and ammo 
---
That's not a bad idea actually, you could use that for Fallout 76's entrance
---
My game crashed and i raged
---
So you can't be good at PvP and PvE that's kind of how every MMO is. You build for one or the other.
---
Pet Rock from Campfire Tales
---
not to mention all the smaller sub-factions, such as the Cult of the Mothman.
---
I find you problematic as well.
---
Get's me excited for some bow hijinx
---
How often do you actually see people running Tenderizer in Nuclear Winter?  Most people just use their Adventure characters in NW and it's not often that people have the high Charisma required to use it.  I think it's fine as-is, it rewards people for investing in a less popular stat.  
---
I'd maybe see where you were coming from if basically everyone was running it and you were at a severe disadvantage if your team didn't have a Tenderizer user on it, but that's simply not the case.  I've been playing NW a lot lately and I've only seen one person using Tenderizer out of dozens of matches. 
---
 There are lots of other ways to increase damage, and at the end of the day, the players with the best aim will win regardless.
---
You can already do this. Form a group and recruit!
---
Thank you, we're investigating.
---
This is the problem. I cater exclusively my vending to low level new players, but I have no way of knowing whether they’re new or a mule. I generally watch their behavior in my camp, and usually it’s pretty clear if they’re new or not.
---
Look for the arrows and their . . . . types :)
---
I think they want actual canon factions, not just generic post-apoc tropes.
---
Thank you! Very very much.
---
Then don't talk about it.
---
I'm not talking about your role playing. I'm talking about the factions you choose in wastelanders, of which BoS and Enclave aren't part of..
---
What's the highest normal carry weight you can achieve (15 strength, and just gear including legendaries, no low health)?
---
Definite Atom Shop skin...
---
I had a note on my billboard for newbies to join and fast travel for free stuff.  Only 2 noobs over a month understood and did. They did get a nice gift bag fully modded pipe guns, armor, radaway, stimpacks  and .38 ammo
---
Thinking 1st might make it easier to help new players, since I could set up a nice camp between 76 and Flatwoods with a sign to "call" me for aid, while I use the tent as a forward operating base. So I don't have to pay caps to get back to what I was doing etc.
---
Then I can let the higher level people pay the vending machine prices while the noobs get some free aid and surplus plans
---
We're actively investigating this issue.
---
It isn't as they are depicting it but it absolutely exists.

 &gt; We're actively investigating this issue.
---
Ah yeah i remember that 😂😂. 
---
Thanks for reminding me. 
---
Yeah should probably have said 'succesfully' in my comment.
---
I'm a grown ass man and this damn near brought a teardrop to my eye. That's my dream marriage right there.
---
I tried something similar in preparation for the vault raid, It was fun but proved kinda worthless in my personal experience.
---
I wouldn’t change much of what you are going for.
---
If you do decide on it I’m sure I still have some decent medic weapons left over. Gladly trade/Sell/pass them :)
---
There are also chameleon legendaries, which are not fussy like the mutation: all other legendary pieces work with it, rather than interfering.
---
We're still tracking down this issue, if you see this happen can you please [file a ticket](https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10) for us?
---
What is the difference? Both are factions of people fighting over a piece of dirt and in the end they put their name on it?
---
As I originally said I think it's because somebody triggered the quest at some point on that world. Heart of the Swamp comes up a lot in these discussions and I think it is a red herring.
---
There is a thread yesterday (https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dsgt3v/strangler_pods_at_dyer_chemical_are_not_turning/) where people are saying they no longer see blooms during/after Heart of the Swamp. It is just my suspicion that Heart of the Swamp was never related to Strangler Blooms spawning.
---
I do believe there is some condition that causes them to spawn and that they do not spawn randomly - I've been leveling up daily on a private world and I always pass by Dyer Chemical to kill the Gulpers before clearing Crevasse Dam. I have not seen Strangler Blooms on a private world yet.
---
 Mothman sounds like a lucky guy
---
Thank you very much!!
---
Doesn't matter if you crash. You go back to the same server.
---
&gt; to gimp their own solo play
---
solo play means exaclt jack shit in this game ,unless you have godly aim and gunskill 
---
having a supprot team mate run tenderizer emt rad sponge hacking lockpicking etc help you win a lot more 
---
this ain't solo game 
---
&gt;you just came in here and started crying NERF like a 5 year old.
---
if the only thing you can do is just imply im crying because iw ant a perk that is more powerful than bloody mess then the joke is on you 
---
what level are you on nw anyway? and how often do you win
---
&gt;Adapt and overcome
---
i am using tenderizer and just won earlier with it
---
i can run something and objectively recognize how broken it is ,considering damage in this game stacks additively instead of multiplicatively

This.  I tried again yesterday both before and after the Heart of the Swamp event and no blooms.  They used to appear like clockwork during this event.   
---
Yes, they can bloom randomly as part of the Dyer Chemical quest, but they always appeared during the Heart of the Swamp event.
---
My though is that this is now bugged and us Radshield fans are left out in the cold with what few supplies we have left.  Given the shortage, I'll be putting mine up for sale starting at 1,000 caps each.....   any takers...  (evil grin)
---
you can have vampire explosive, but AFAIK, not V,E, and TS together
---
I tried to relog and crashed and was just done with the game for a moment
---
yut this is the only workaround that works for me.  also wear your lucky socks
---
What do you mean "trolling players with the paintball gun"? What did they actually do?
---
Why? Because I would rather see people discover content through actual gameplay? That is rich
---
Nice sounds good! Honestly for me just remove vats entirely from PVP and I'm good with it all day
---
Some of them I keep. Why? One day we will probably get the ability to uplevel weapons / legendaries. On that day - Perfect Storm will rise again.
---
My first match in the morning is a little bit but it seems like after that they come pretty frequently.
---
Lots of the same faces though so I can't imagine the number of active NW players is too large
---
We live together currently, have for several months! We get along very well! He does my laundry, I make the bed, we keep the place clean, and I’m very happy. Thank you!
---
He's there as a placeholder for now--
---
When wastelanders shows up, he'll be the head of the House of Scares faction. Rep grinds will consist of trick or treating (looting from certain candy bowls in various enemy locations), or if you're a stealth build you can do a quest where you place flaming bags at the front entrance of those same locations for rep
---
Aaaw, we’re very blessed!!
---
Unstoppable Monster is something special tho - it literally slays
---
We’re talking about a tiny nugget of content here. Not a giant quest or some massive hidden thing. Its a couple of keys and an item. You’re blowing it way out of proportion.
---
I think it's a problem on your end. NW loads way faster than adventure mode for me, though I have to say that I use custom ini files optimized for maximum performance (I play on PC).

---
Twinsies!! ❤️
---
PSA for everyone reading this - don't complete the legendary Named weapons until your 50 so you get a 50 level weapon for the quests when it levels to your level.
---
That's amazing!! Good luck to the both of you guys.
---
I also love how I was down voted for just bringing up points I've seen with friends doing the same thing in the past.
---
&gt; How often do you actually see people running Tenderizer in Nuclear Winter? 
---
1 in 3 matches i get someone with tenderizer 
---
&gt;I think it's fine as-is, it rewards people for investing in a less popular stat.
---
charisma in nuclear winter is amazing,if you don't have a team mate with charisma perks you are gimping yourself 
---
&gt;There are lots of other ways to increase damage, and at the end of the day
---
thing is if you don't run tenderizer you gimp yourself by abou 20% damage which is quite a lot 
---
its not like tis adventure mode counter part where its 7% for 10 seconds at max level
---
here its 20%
---
&gt;and at the end of the day, the players with the best aim will win regardless.
---
if oyu can react yes they will more often than not if i go againts someone using tenderizer its mostly about the luck of the draw of who sees first
---
I have a very similar build, but I have 3 less in INT. With one extra into Perception for Concentrated Fire (Occasional Vats body part targeting) and Class Freak with level 3. I also like Gun Fu 1 just in the case I lose sneak and a bunch of mobs are after me and I resort to vats.
---
I don't have pics either.  all I can say is while I was playing at that time, all indicators pointed to his statement s being true
---
It’s been said multiple times in the comments what happened, but anyway they increased the weight of the gun to something stupid like 300/400.. so the gun would take up your entire player carry weight or half you stash box for the one paintball gun..
---
Who knows, he might pay for it if he does have it or then again might not even support the decision to add it to 76 and not own the sub. 
---
It wouldn't be the first time Pete was kept out of the loop regarding fallout 76 stuff. At launch he didn't even know there was a stash limit so it wouldn't surprise me if he was unaware that they intended to put Fallout First in until the last minute.
---
The only way to really know is from the man himself and he hasn't come forward about it yet, probably due to the community response thus far  and feeling like he would have hundreds of people who don't like First jumping down his throat if he tried to address it.
---
A lot of those low levels will be players with new characters too (I have a level 330 and a level 16 character for example). They know they won't need 4 sets of leather armour or 4 .308 rifles. So they take the essentials and move on. So it's not all mean higher level players.
---
I would keep the TSE. I Run a TSE Handmade as one of my main go to weapons and I love it. Accuracy isn’t the best unless scoped but overall I’m still happy to use a TSE. LEGENDARY effects are definitely better suited to certain gun types imo. Yes the legendary effect always has the same effect, but depending on the gun damage and fire rate I feel that the effects are more beneficial on some guns than others.
---
Sounds right, I'm nonbloodied but my pipe gets about  400 damage with no drugs so I bet a thousand is about right.
---
Except scaling up the equipment wouldn't really address the reason why armor is op. Damage resist doesn't really matter very much, the percent based reductions are why the assassin/sentinel armor was broken. The damage boost on weapons wouldn't help pvp though, the main problem isn't the legacy duped weapons but the fact that damage itself is tuned waaaay to high compared to player hp, it isn't hard to kill anyone in pvp, I killed tons of people in survival using regular non-legendaries all the time with much ease. The duped legendaries just feed into the problem being that they make landing hits easy and have top tier damage winning in direct shoot outs. 
---
What made people unkillable was the stacking percent reductions on assassin sentinel. Now they don't activate all the time so they typically are vulnerable to rapid fire weapons since a few bad procs leave you dead. 
---
Just look at how they balance PvE they give enemies stupidly large healthbars because that is how the system was designed in fallout 4, it's not designed for pvp. What they need to do is massive reduce damage dealt in pvp where everyone doesn't die in 0.5 seconds of attacks. Which are easy to land because of Vats.
---
Well you can only have one of those, explosive and faster fire rate take up the same legendary slot. But yeah if that was possible that would be highly sought after.
---
This could be interesting. I really liked using the bow in Tombraider....
---
Hmm, I understand where you’re coming at there. I have a complete vats build with a fixer and I wanted to stay away as much as possible, but I can see where you’re coming at there.
---
What system are you on?  Do you need help launching a nuke?  There are plenty here who would be willing to pitch in if you do.
---
I do this as well. I'll even take the precaution of turning my vending machines off.
---
The Vault Tec lights work the same, so I'd assume the Red &amp; White would too.
---
They go to their machines and sell them.
---
I followed a lvl 200 something gal who grabbed all my free purified water (50) to the nearest vendor, and lo and behold, the Flatwood bot now had 50 water on sale.
---
Out came the 3 * Executioner's  Gatling Gun...
---
It was worth being wanted for the next 20 minutes.
---
in the article they state that they talked to a bunch of players, all denying any sort or "war".  then they say weeks later they find a short dozen players who are roleplaying (ur .0001%).  then it's off to the races
---
I'm going to lean towards the optimistic side and hope it's just a third, C.A.M.P. radio. 😁
---
This is amazing! Congratulations and good luck to you both :)
---
Not just atomic shop items. ALL camp items. It seems pretty arbitrary. Why can I delete a foundation and build 2 pictures but if I delete 2 pictures I cant build a foundation?*
---
*not a literal example but those who build know
---
And a hypocrite too.  Tell me, is it only worth screaming how overpowered it is when it's used on you?
---
$0, exactly.
---
I can absolutely get behind this.
---
Why was this downvoted?
---
Yup I gave up on using a suppressor on shotguns  cause you do something like 90% reduced damage once youre past the weapons effective range. I keep an instigating / power attack combat knife for stealth purposes.
---
Forget explosive. Bloodied hell yes, my Bloodied combat shotty kicks hard. 
---
When I want explosive, I pull out my Instigating Explosive combat.
---
The internet is vicious! So I’ve learned in the last bit of time...lol There’s a saying “the wise learn from history, fools learn from experience.” I agree to an extent. We had talked about marrying next fall, but I just lost a close relative and am worried about others health. If we had already planned on next year, why not go ahead? We can afford it, we’re both very committed. We’re very blessed!
---
Damn. Im happy for you
---
one thing of note is the mothman dance.  it's great solo but when you have a whole NW lobby spamming the button, whelp the sounds over lap and you get a horrible feedback like sound.  I only used it once there and never again
---
Sounds a lot like real life.
---
Yeah. I did the same thing and saw a level 300 guy on my base marker and then i got the notifications when player buys something and it was all the free stuff for low levelers. The stuff in the machine was of no use to anyone over level 50.
---
Its a couple of keys that would have taken months or longer to find and connect the dots if the information wasn't datamined.
---
That quest was giant without just cheating up the answers by diving into the game files.
---
You are discounting the effort it would have taken to find without cheating.
---
Because it's sarcastic but also probably true, since we got Halloween skins for the lootbag.
---
thank you all for the amazing advice for setting up builds.
---
Quite the quick courting period
---
At least it's better than a scotch beast corpse following you....
---
I got a cool screen shot of one the other day with its head sticking out of my window and its body outside the wall at my CAMP.  It looked like the scotch beast flew into my window and broke its neck...
---
Which is why I posted this here. You'll know to avoid it if you really are a good person.
---
 I love when people start doing FO1st dances they always get a thumbs up and I don't have a sub, it is just kinda fun and funny 😎
---
We are both absolutely floored by the countless congratulations, well wishes, and advice given by all of you. Blaine and I are shocked that many care about our love story! Bethesda has even reached out to us, sending well wishes and offering gifts. When I typed this, I just wanted to share my thankfulness, and I’m over the moon with joy. Thank you very much, sincerely!
---
Camp budget is a pain and I agree that they don't offer proper numeric value of all items for the camp budget. There is so much more I'd like to do sometimes and I constantly have to delete and reoptimize blindly because you don't know precisely how much space each item take on a camp.
---
They call it clickbait for a reason.
---
Some people fall for the bait.
---
Next time, don't be one of them.
---
You need fireproof if you don't have dense on your torso. 2 points is enough, and will make you immune to scorchbeast screeching. I'd take a point off covert operative and maybe a point from one of the gunslingers. That 5% extra damage is great, but not necessary.
---
Let me ask this, is this both of yours first "real" relationship? You are 18 years old and all of my friends that got married at that age have kids and looking at or have been divorced. 
---
I agree with that statement but some people dont learn from books or classrooms, some learn by doing.
---
I would make one huge suggestion, get a prenuptial agreement and keep finances separate for a few years. That just mean what yours is yours and what hers is hers just in case. You dont want to plan for it but it's better to be safe than sorry.
---
I like it. We need some form of meaningful pvp that isn’t NW, I’m talking open world running into someone and adding some suspense. Kind of like survival, but with some sort of end game to it, not just ganking.
---
Ive been doing this since January. 
---
I can help. Check my post history for a guide. If you are on PC shoot me your ign and we can work together. 
---
People want interaction. Wherever you send them... Make sure another "NPC" is there waiting to talk to them or challenge/help/fight them. Thats the biggest tip. 
---
You want to create story, lore, drama and danger. I frequently send people to workshops that have a bad guy NPC they need to defeat. 
---
Humor and sound effects keep people interested.
---
A rehash of what was said in the previous ITV.
---
Look at the post history of the ppl claiming this stuff. Many of them post to incite anger, get their upvotes then leave. Your basic " beth bad, ruin fo, p2w, uninstalling today" anytime beth does anything.
---
You can agree and be angry with them, or ignore them and continue to pacify the appalacha wasteland while seeing someone do a goofy robot dance once in a while.
---
I paid $18 for this game well worth it. I might buy a month in the future just as a way to say thanks.
---
I can't really tell. They were really vague. I almost wonder if they just want a guild system. As for Canon factions we really don't know what all there will be. We know Raiders and settlers are the main focus, but there's also been leaks pertaining to &gt;!the secret service which is good ol Frank Horrigan's Outfit in the Enclave (tho obviously not yet in the timeline)!&lt;. They also mentioned the Mothman Cult coming back, and there's nothing stopping any of the other factions in the region from reforming if the Cult can.
---
So a rehash of a rehash?
---
from what was taught to me.
---
sneak has 3 triggers.  sound, light, line of sight. muffled, shadowed, and err if you close your eyes they can't see you maybee?
---
Awesome, I wanted a cool weapon that not everyone runs and flex on people thattheres more than copying YouTube videos
---
i said its overpowered when i use it as well
---
&gt;my private has been up for over 1,5hours before nuking
---
LOL!
---
I’m 23, he’s 25. He’s had a seven year relationship, I’ve had a three year relationship. No children, no pesky long lost lovers. Never divorced. Both have faith. We both have full time jobs with benefits. We’re paying for our wedding ourself, minus a few decorations. We are attending premarital counseling. Thank you.
---
My anxiety is too bad to actually add strangers but I wanted to commend you for this post and for your strength! To all of us, despite our struggles, have fun adventuring and see you in Appalachia 💕 Glad to have found a lovely community like this.
---
I run into this problem frequently. My CAMP is set up outside of Charleston, and I try to cater to level 20-30 (especially those who might be starting the Mistress of Mysteries quest line). I have absolutely no way to stock my vendors with level appropriate legendaries, and NOT have them bought out by a higher level character for scrip. Likewise for stimpacks and chems, which I try to price appropriately for the levels I target.
---
Maybe I can put a sign on one vendor to indicate that it's contents are for lower levels only, but in the end its the honor system.
---
Shit, I had a stack of 20 radshield at 25 caps ea in my machine for a month.  Finally gave it to some fresh level 50s I met doing a nuked mischief night over the weekend cause I was tired of sitting on em.  They definately dont sell like they did around Christmas right after launch that's for sure.
---
Unyielding seems to have disappeared from player vending machines now, must be only available in trade subs I guess.
---
Go find me an official post that says the paints you wanted were to be free
---
I couldn't agree more
---
Yeah.  Between Lucky Hole Mine (400+ lead ore), Hemlock Holes Workshop (acid), Tanagra town (acid), and the various faire grounds (cloth), I'm keeping well stocked with 50 cal and 5.56 ammo.  
---
I also hit up the power plants every so often for 100% fusion cores.  I can make them but I get plans to sell for doing the power plant events.
---
It would be really nice to see then get introduced. 
---
And yeah the lack of a proper in game guild system is the big hinderance for faction RP.
---
It happens little by little, before he'll even know it; he'll be a different person. Belkar paired with Roy, different person
---
one of us one of us
---
I meant like a guild system
---
I mean a guild system to be more formal
---
Seeing as it took them ~40 days to fix the Combat Armor Camo Paint, I wouldn’t hold your breath on this being fixed anytime soon. Maybe when Halloween rolls around again..
---
100% agree
---
IMO, Unyielding when at low health trumps every other option.  Yes, you have to be at low health, but your Agility points go through the roof.  If you can get them past 20, you essentially can hide-in-plain-sight, right in front of Super Mutants, even without the Sneak perk.
---
Plus, it will also buff Perception, so if you are a sneak VATS user, that initial shot has a pretty high chance of being 95% right from the start.
---
Well, heavy weapons without power armor is kinda weak. Unless your doing bloodied and have high damage per shot, that armor penetration you get from stabilized is necessary. Also rank 5 adrenaline is something you should really consider, heavy weapons are still kinda on the weak side and need any boost you can get because sneak attacks and vats crits arent viable.
---
If you remove all the dr perks you have and just wear power armor, you will have just as much or more dr with better heavy gun accuracy and armor penetration, with tons of points free'd up. Just put on dodgy and maybe leave on bullet shield. A heavy build without bear arms isn't much of a heavy build, and you might want to consider bandolier as well. 
---
If you were doing raids this could be pretty good, but you would fall short without a good team. Most good builds don't need a healer for anything other than picking them up when downed though.
---
No, they dont, but every so often someone cleans me out of the few I put up for sale.
---
I've had an instigating gauss rifle with +33% Vats sitting in my vending for two weekends now. I only play for like 3-4 hours each day on the weekends. I've had visitors, but no one will touch the thing. 700 caps seems fair people! I should spell out a sign that says "will mod - just ask."
---
Use my knowledge, I beg of you.
---
Wow you guys move fast. I was with my wife 3 years before I asked her to marry me. Fallout 76 hasn’t been online a year yet 😅
---
I would've joined you in that battle! I hate that sort of mean-spirited money-grubbing sooo much. I know it's only a game, but it says a lot about them as a person.
---
But you still are using it.  That's the point.  It's so unfair but you're using it.  And winning marches with it as you said.
---
And it's not unfair, or OP, as many people are chiming in.  It's a 9 point perk it better be impactful and it's a charisma perk at that.  I also have heard of very, very few people using it because it's a deep charisma perk.  Maybe its cause I play on ps4.  Meh.
---
Anything painful I should look out for?
---
I was playing for a few hours last night, and I did get a lot of matches in. But it's just so tedious getting from match to match.
---
1-2 minutes to get back to the main menu. Another minute or so to find another lobby. Get in the lobby, 2 minutes til deployment. Then another minute for loading into the match. 
---
So you're looking at at least 5 minutes between matches. 
---
To be honest, I don't mind all that much..but it's extremely pronounced when you get in and die within 5 minutes. For me, I start fuming cause of how quickly I died and now I feel like I've just been in loading screens for 20 minutes straight.
---
I'm sure you'll get some DMs soon lol
---
[](/starlightisee)Ah, I see. That would be cool. Altho considering how buggy the basic friends list is, I think it might be a ways off.
---
It'll be $6.59 a month.
---
It's a tough deal.  I will always grab a lever or a handmade if they are cheap just to scrap them to learn mods.  Yesterday I was shopping the vendors and somebody had radaway for cheap, I grabbed them all.  I never know if people are selling stuff cheap for quoc caps or if they have no idea about prices or if they are trying to help low levels.  I do read signs or small letters though. I don't think most people even care.   It's tough out in the wasteland.
---
The stealth archer is back
---
Are you in Oceania? I find it almost impossible to find matches here. I team up with a Brit usually and don't have trouble with servers in UK/Europe.
---
Some youtuber would've spent 20 hours grinding it and discovering it anyways and releasing a video. You're over exaggerating the effects of datamining.
---
I feel like I can no longer wear by monocle in good conscience... I haven’t earned it. I, sadly, am not a member.
---
I'm not expecting much, if anything at all. There's been practically nothing from Bethesda ever since Patch 14's announcements, despite the fact that it's probably most important to communicate *more* right now to address questions and worries about the delay of a major content update.
---
Quality post, thank you so much! I’ll look into these raids and dungeons, but I’m most interested in the backpack if it has meaningful use like it sounds
---
I have decent internet speed and adventure mode loads fine. Must be my xbox or their xbox servers
---
It sometimes comes a bit late. Im not expecting too much from it. Always hoping for the best though!
---
Well excuse me “mr fancy-pants-i-have-a-job”
---
I think a price ratio as to your level would be ideal.  Like level 1-10 get 50% off the list price, level 11-25 get like 25% off, level 26-40 get 15% off.  I don't know how hard it would be to make that an actual thing incorporated into the game.   I'd be fine with that.
---
If the values for the budget space on individual items are listed in the files couldn't a modder make something that adds a value under the camp items and a total value under the available budget?
---
&gt; It's a 9 point perk it better be impactful and it's a charisma perk at that
---
i have nothing againts 9 point perks being impactfu lbut they have to be balanced to boot,i don't want the perk removed i just want it reduced to something more normal 
---
&gt;I also have heard of very, very few people using it because it's a deep charisma perk
---
you should use it yourself ,you can thank me later 
---
charisma as a whole is very underrated in nuclear winter,too many squads go full damage with no support and get destroyed
---
Rounding. A picture could be 4.5 "budget points" and a foundation 10. Scrapping the two pictures doesn't give you enough for a foundation.
---
But yeah I just want more build budget frankly. Don't really care how.
---
Yeah, it's got different mods too. Bear in mind that it was one of the additions that's meant to be one of the "long term" filler additions, like vault raids or Nuclear winter rewards. This means that the challenges for it can feel a little grindy
---
I'm kinda curious
---
I did exactly that.. and got a response.  I've updated the original post with their reply.
---
Although a good idea, I think we should be able to control the discount, if that makes sense, where we can set out own level for the price ratio 
---
It would potentially be difficult but doable
---
I actually don’t right now. I make money doing odd jobs I find on gumtree and Facebook and flipping things for profit.
---
I would enjoy a double .50 cal. or a minigun on an AA mount so for camp owners to jump on and defend against scorchbeasts . Plus it just looks cool
---
Ya'll seem like you got some good heads on your shoulders! That's rare now and even more so the young a person is it seems. 
---
I wish the both of you the best of luck and a happy marriage.
---
The ITV will just show a picture of a beautiful remastered Ranger Sequoia, and nothing else. They won't release it, but they will use it in all future screenshots.
---
Apocalypse Aristocrats are group taking fun advantage of the FO1st controversy.  There was so much “hate” posts on this Reddit that it gave the idea owning it :) ... in the name of fun, entertainment and role play community.
---
After all... if it’s acceptable to play as a “raider”... why not an “Aristocrat”? :)
---
Only if it has perks to benefit it. Without perks it will be garbage
---
Why not? Doesn't matter how old they are, it still sounds like a whiny child. 
---
 "Things didn't go the way I wanted so I'm mad about it now. I'm raising my fists in the air shaking them and writing this post"
---
 "Some people paid money for extra conveniences and I didn't. I want the same stuff but I want it free"
---
 "I already paid $60 for the game I should be able to get free unlimited updates forever!"
---
"Those big meanie's lied to me"
---
 "They delayed an update to make it better but I want to bitch and cry about it anyway because I want it now!"
---
Yep, entitled whiny children.
---
Why do you need to help lower levels no one help us when the game first came out its supposed to be tuff roaming the wasteland with 1 stim and 5 bullets left in you gun it makes you think how to get through the next stage the need to search every box or body to SURVIVE just leave them they will be fine it's not sims its fo76, harden up peaple
---
Not everyone would have access via mod though, the problem might be lessened but it would still exist
---
Thank you!!
---
To be fair I never read what you wrote on vending machines. Heck I once went to a vending machine saw XO plans was like OMG and then released guy wrote in neon letter XO plans. I do see sometimes free stuff and only grabbed 10mm ammo(I'm desperate so don't judge) despite being a higher lvl.
---
by my watch, today is less than half over.
---
Bethesda "No, if we tell you then you would realize you don't have enough budget and buy it"
---
It would have taken way more than 20 hours to figure out. After it was found first they would have done what you say. But no YouTuber would have put the effort in on what would have been an insanely long search when there is lower hanging fruit to gain views prior.
---
I’m pretty sure rifleman effects the crossbow.. if it effects the cross bow I see no problem with allowing rifleman to effect the bow stats.. even if it is no way a rifle 🤷‍♂️
---
It's bullshit. Support might not have the tools but the people who handle server backups do. Keep pushing otherwise they have to admit that they don't have server backups.
---
Did you start out with a thesis you're trying to disprove?
---
Did you have a control group?
---
No?  Then you didn't do an experiment.
---
You did some observations.
---
Haha you might be on to something here
---
Before safety was invented.
---
That would be nice, we really need more in game social tools.
---
Bethesda can't make it till they fix the budget bugs. Currently if you place a floor and change it to something else it takes twice the amount of budget and only known way to reduce it back to correct amount is move or switch to original tile you placed then relogin. Few other phantom bugs but only one I was able to reliable check.
---
Yeah that makes sense
---
They still have one vault to open... could be that... I mean its about time... infact no better time then now since we wont be getting wastelanders anytime soon...
---
Bethesda "No we aren't spending our hard earned money to get rights to play old music"
---
Side fact Happy Birthday is owned so you can't sing it on a movie unless you ready to pay the big bucks to use its rights.
---
Couldn't even post an Atomic Shop update.  The Fallout page looks deader than ever.
---
Nah 1st for free would be stupid plus they need to make money. If you don't like it just don't buy it. It's not q must have thing.
---
Yes, we could, Join fallout 1st today, and we'll add this in the Future!
---
Nah.  At this point, it's not worth the stomach acid.
---
There are other games to play made by companies that at least seem competent.
---
I am expecting one, yes. I am however not expecting much to be said.
---
You drive a BMW, don't you?
---
Yeah i primed my gauss rifle , but ultracite is annoying to go and get, but if i did farm for the plans and prime it , it could give me more of a reason to play
---
They don't stack????
---
I forgot to mention, but NW waits for everyone to load so that everyone can start at roughly the same time. It seems like console manufacturers go the cheaper way when it comes to storage speed because even budget hard drives for desktops are faster than console storage drives, so your console specifically might not have a problem.
---
Wow entitled much? Theres already plenty of variety on the map, one part regular map and one part on fire.
---
It is stupid. I do plan on trying it. I have just given up on ever playing wastlanders.
---
&gt;Granted power armor sucks for pvp. 
---
Virtually any non-legendary  armor sucks in PVP,  from what I've seen, and only a handful of legendary modifiers are viable.  That isn't a problem with Power Armor it's a problem with the game's balancing in general.
---
They are hoping it will all blow over
---
I have a shotgunner character too, and gave up on the plastic. I just use all lead and steel I farm to craft 5.56's instead. Then I sell them and buy shotgun shells with the caps I earn. A lot less hassle and 5.56's seem to be in far higher demand than both shells and .45's even with The Fixer challenging the handmades.
---
Well then they shouldn’t have posted about it if they didn’t want to hear any feedback. Haven’t even seen anyone be rude, just concerned.
---
I hear ya! It get tedious you should have the option to jump straight back in
---
Was this recently or about a week ago? Ign is the Same name as I have on Reddit. Tried giving someone some stuff near 76, they seemed confused and then disappeared. Thought I scared them so bad they quit the game when I was trying to help them!! 
---
I thought it was pretty damn funny though.
---
We are still an Vault late, what do you think? Maybe for patch 15? Since it is a frozen vault would be a good ideia to release during the winter!
---
Commenting to find later, in case this thread gets removed like so many others
---
And i see it now.... hahahahaha
---
Oh yeah, I mean I buy shells when I see them in player vendors. But at this point, farming plastic is so deeply ingrained that I just wouldn't have anything to do if I gave it up completely. I usually have 10k+ shells on me at any given time, it's not like I *need* it. I enjoy the hunt I guess.
---
Agreed.
---
Would be a cool idea to have virtual birthday parties on your actual bday. Guess you'd have to turn loose of your birth date...but maybe you get a free in-game gift as part of the incentive.
---
Dropped like 5 this week
---
&gt;In the end game, Power Armor is almost entirely eclipsed in all areas compared to legendary regular armor items/builds.
---
I wouldn't say that. I'd say it's eclipsed by a small handful of RNG generated mods and legendary modifiers,  A full set of non-legendary heavy BOS combat armor doesn't come close to my Ultracite power armor in terms of damage and radiation resistance.
---
I want to be apart of the cult of mothman
---
I'm from uk so I assume European servers. I wish I had people to team up with to heighten my chances, but barely have time to play at all nowadays
---
You should have been investigating it for at least the last five months people have been complaining about it.
---
I always thought I should be dropped immediately into a lobby upon death.
---
I hate going to select NW again.
---
I also hate diddling with my perk load out in lobby... Opening packs and whatnot. I should be able to do that outside the lobby.
---
If there's a way, enlighten me.
---
Maybe they are attacking each other cause people are tired of hearing the damn emote every 5 minutes.
---
I guess that depends on where your watch is at and what you consider half over? lol It's already 12:30pm for me.
---
Maybe try not showing the camp on the map? Unhook the vending machines from generators
---
Well done
---
Ah, downvoted facts. Love it.
---
I have a tse .50cal. I used it for a while until I got a bloodied 1 star .50, which does like 400-500 per bullet when my adrenaline is stacked and I'm in the 20% health range. Blows the tse out of the water, and the only full health guns that are gonna come close to that is junkies. Personally I think explosive is over rated and much prefer faster fire rate on almost anything.
---
Completly open... and no bushes? How am I supossed to reach top 10 without bushes?
---
Of a rehash, really.
---
Look whatcha did, they know about it and will patch it like Feed the People. :L
---
8 year old low end Honda.
---
I double that like wtf
---
This game has a day and nigth cicle? Its always sunny in my games... even when the moon and stars are up...
---
Mine was to get all the asylum outfits, but I completed that like two days ago :D now I'm just trying to get the hunters long coat and some magazines for my camp
---
Frugal.  :)
---
But it's perpetually 10/23 in the game, I think. Wouldn't make sense.
---
I dont usually do pvp, mostly because I enjoy exploring more. But! I would be down with pvp with a purpose, other than just killing. Sounds like a ........... blast??
---
The most wholesome comments in this entire subreddit right here
---
Internet hyperbole.
---
Name... Checks... Out?..
---
They do, but given the way the previous one was received, I don't think too many players will get excited over that.
---
Personally, I'd rather see one really solid Vault Raid with a couple random branches than a rotation of 3 mediocre ones.
---
11:30 am here

Dweebin’

In the real world of scientific literature, nobody follows that stupid scientific method outline you learned in 7th grade science.  A hypothesis isn't required.  Generally there's an objective, methods used, results, and conclusion.
---
You don't necessarily need a control group to do a proper study, either.  Nor are control groups always possible, be it ethically or statistically.  In this instance what transpired would be called a case study.
---
Also, this is a discussion group about a video game.  Just let it go.
---
Again, the advice wasn't solicited. They weren't asking for relationship feedback. This isn't /r/relationships. Comments like that are to be expected, but it's really not anybody's place to make them. I've seen a couple people be pretty rude about it.
---
Every now and then I see two people alive st the end (not including cheaters) just standing there waiting for the end. So they probably are just cheating to kill everyone else and then letting their Main win.
---
No ones offended, it’s just stupid. Couples meet in games all the time, no offense to OP but they’re not special at all.
---
Only issue there is in a shot or two I'm dead. Every. Single. Time.
---
Happened to me.  O deselected the quest, exited pipboy, reentered and reselected and they appeared, if memory serves.   Ive sometimes had to fast travel to get them to appear also.
---
Edited for clarity and typo.
---
Limb damage isnt that bad actually. I have an executioners 50% limb less vats cost handmade and that thing shreds. Very useful to switch to when I'm helping noobs level up at WS too. On leg shot will leave em low health and crippled so they shamble around like classic zombies
---
Strangely, it didn't work for me when I put on the glowing skeleton costume. Then I took it off and it came back... don't know what to think of that, but hey more data.
---
Yeah, there is no way they are not adding a new ammo system similar to the one from New Vegas.
---
I just want Check points to the raid... Each zone could have a timer, but not the hole raid
---
Yeah, they do follow that 'stupid scientific method'.
---
Wait, really? Dang it. *\*throws away hammer and sickle\**
---
We hear you here at bethesda, we think it's a good idea,  
---
we are proud to present that idea ingame soon after wastelanders come out!  
---
Access to this unique pvp area starts at a cheap price of 29.99
---
Ok? You realize that’s not a majority outcome, right?
---
But you didn't let it go.
---
Literally a few hours after my post so sometime yesterday.. unless i slipped into a time bubble which is possible lol :)
---
Though I will never forgive Bethesda for what they've done to the Fallout franchise, this just proves that, even with the worst of games, there is always a silver lining.
---
We can't ever knock players for appreciating a game, or what it gives them in their lives. Especially when it leads to spectacular results like this.
---
Congratulations! I wish you two the best.
---
Or how about a separate server based only on pvp where factions attempt to conquer the whole map?
---
Rewards could be based on area controlled, kills, and supplies gathered. I could get into that as well. All skill sets in the game would be useful. Pvp and pve. In my mind it seems interesting
---
Online game... They cant handle an event with Explosive cars much less a random dungeon per player
---
Strength has Heavy,Melee, or Shotgun
---
Perception has semi automatic, automatic rifles, and xbow
---
Agi has pistols...let agility have it or swap them the xbow
---
But not a lot of them work out.
---
Same issue for me last night. Collected building materials and scrapping armor/clothes/weapons already completed. Pisses me off since I'm trying like mad to get atoms for the red rocket bundle before it leaves again.
---
If the reference is there, then its not just fallout 76 tags.
---
I’d be happy if it was like a daily (maybe weekly) swap out.  Not a big player base so I feel this option would keep it fresher? 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
You make good points
---
Maybe something more like this
---

---
Cheap :P
---
I rarely drive (oddly, that was the case when I bought it, and is the case now, but for completely different reasons).  I wanted reliability and reasonable resale value if I changed my mind.
---
Memes aside, I never considered a BMW, but I did have my eye on a nice Infinity FX at the time.  But at 2.5x the cost, and with my job security at the time being inadequate, I went with what I could pay for outright.  Turned out to be a really good decision.
---
Something like that could work, create more bow variety’s and add some more cross bow varients/ mods and I’d be perfectly happy with a perkset like “Bowman” “Master Bowman” etc..
---
The only war I've seen is the hilarious stuff posted in the f76fb community I'm in. It's non stop , the posts and comments are far too toxic to share in this delicate community.
---
They said they were going to retune the effect for energy weapons, and then add them back in when they removed them. I'm starting to think it was a lie.
---
There isn't a shortage of explosive energy weapons, don't worry. The only thing there's a shortage of is people who are open to trading their extra dupes. It's because the dupers specifically keep those to trade for specific items they want to dupe later
---
Since heavies seem to rely heavily on PA, could you recommend an explosive/auto rifle build? I deisgned a quick framework but I know it can be made better. [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=2e668f5&amp;d=s01pg2ph2pi2pp2pq1eh2eo2c72ck0i12ib4a72a12am2a04lt2l71a40&amp;w=&amp;m=&amp;nw=&amp;n=](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=2e668f5&amp;d=s01pg2ph2pi2pp2pq1eh2eo2c72ck0i12ib4a72a12am2a04lt2l71a40&amp;w=&amp;m=&amp;nw=&amp;n=)
---
Cleaver,tomahawk,sheepsquatch shard, and the lowest of all the throwing knife
---
I agree though if itd bring those weapons a lil love make them a bit more viable
---
I thought they said that people over 50 would become "legendary" or something like that
---
More variety?  It's got plenty of variety.  You can get killed by a hacker using aimbot, you can get killed by a hacker shooting into the sky, you can get killed by a hacker radiating a death field, you can get killed by a hacker who clips through walls, you can get killed by a hacker who can see the contents of crates before opening them, and you can even get killed by hacker who revives themselves when they're downed.  What more variety do you need??
---
I totally agree that Power Armor needs an overhaul and to have legendary power armor pieces. It's ridiculous that when I get into a giant mechanical metal suit that I do less damage and can carry less than I do with my regular armor. Power armor pieces have zero value as they are easily farmable and pretty much the only thing you can do to improve power armor is hunt the rare mod plans. It's a shame too because there are so many neat power armor sets like Excavator and Ultracite that just go unused because the standard T-51 outclasses almost all of them.
---
Saw a Fallout 1st member playing so tricked him into joining my party then I did the unspeakable. I made him a camp with all the trimmings from turrets to Nuclear Generator as a way of saying thanks for supporting the game.
---
It wouldn't be completely fair to call Zenimax that in general. Unless they've made some really recent crappy decisions with the Elder Scrolls Online, overall, I find that game to be good overall.
---
I'm not sure how development was different between the two games, so if you can enlighten me, I would appreciate it. 😅
---
U just have to work on strategy and choose a build so u can have the best perk cards for it every body is different one guy I play with even has a melee build for nw and he gets quite a few kills le as rn to dodge more while shooting try to think about where other teams might be
---
Yep! That's partly why so many vendor camps disappear underneath you.  The owners get notified that they just had a large sale, so they immediately log out before someone else's purchase puts them over the caps limit.  Frustrating.
---
I don't know a good answer for the caps limit problem.  It's arguably necessary, to limit inflation effects.  Dunno if over-cap sales losses are counted in B's cap sink calculations, but they do remove caps from the money supply.  I'd hope they wouldn't plan around that!
---
It seems like they could implement something similar to the max weight cap: allow a single purchase to exceed the cap, then forbid any further caps additions until you're back under 30k.  I suppose people would abuse that by deliberately setting up trades with mules to hold excesses, which would end up increasing money supply and inflation overall.
---
Similarly, forbidding sales that would drive the owner over the limit would lead to frustrations.  Buyers would continually be presented with vendor items they can't purchase, while sellers would have no incentive to shut down their vendors while they have even one saleable item left.  Automatically passing items back and forth from vendor inventory based on cap limits (e.g. not listing any item over 1,000 caps if owner is at 29,000 caps) would cause all sorts of database and social/sales problems, I expect.
---
Even if a class war was existing, why would the media care about it ? The Fallout 76 PvP combat system would practicly make it into a community event, made by the community itself, and not something that harmful.  
---
I feel like the game has other problems we should care about.
---
It halves Tank Killer, so rather than 36% at max level, it's 18%.
---
Edit: I generally run Tank Killer maxed, and have slapped on a perforating magazine on my AAE handmade. It's all diminishing returns, but I can't help myself.
---
They leaked stuff about fo 1st that there will be exclusive stuff there but only for fo 1st members
---
Affordability is relative. You can't decide for others.
---
Pfft, looks at this guy and his gumtree!
---
Not me then. I try and help out low levels when I get bored but I've had terrible luck lately. Last time I tried, I was in the pipboy dropping a bag and noticed a wolf sneaking up behind the guy.  I tried to exit out real quick and take it out but I was too slow. Once it hit him, he thought I lured him into a trap and immediately logged out lol.
---
I was trying to drop him some low level legendaries and aid.  He thinks I was trying to kill him though.
---
Exactly...so why the hell do people want an in game tribute to this? That’s why that person got downvoted. It’s stupid and imo OP is rushing into this and I don’t see it ending well.
---
Maybe one every 50 levels lol. You could be wayyyy too op with the rite build.
---
Thanks for the idea
---
I think more and more peeps are realizing that the forums are more fun than the game.
---
I think we should be allowed to use our legendary mods from the purveyor on the PA, and to have our underarmor matter.
---
Hmmm that's still almost 70% do you think piercing would put it at 75?
---
Very much yes! I just hope we can get those kangaroo legs from the early promotional videos!
---
It doesn’t need to be in relationships. If you’re on a public forum posting something, you know people are going to comment their opinions wether you asked for them or not. If you don’t want to hear any opinions, don’t post. And if you post, don’t expect everyone to think it’s the cutest, bestest thing ever and agree with you.
---
If true  that can't be good for long term player attraction, if the public servers are not seeing the full scope of the game how will new players gain a liking for the game? There options being pay 20, or 30 dollars for the game and another 100 a year depending on where you live? As players drift away they need to attract new players or eventually only the die hard fans remain which won't likely cover costs and those die hards will be expected to pay more and more to maintain profitability for Bethesda

---
Damn, you've got me thinking now. I use aa weapons with perforating magazines plus 3 rank tank killer. Wondering if I'm wasting some perk points....
---
Breach n Clear or The Ventolator
---
YES!
---
I just want the OG survival servers back with 2x cap penalties and aid drops.

Hey everyone, husband to be here! Just wanted to say a big thanks for all the best wishes and some of the concerns! Just wanted to verify that yes, it is indeed real lol. She's the woman of my dreams and everything I've been looking for! We always indirectly knew each other and I always had a crush on her. I knew many of her friends, since many of them were mine as well. We're both adults and feel that our life goals line up. When you know, you just know! To everyone on here that has concerns or even some of the "harsher" opinions, I understand completely. I won't take the time to justify it to bunch of strangers on the internet though. I wish the best for you and that you find what you're looking for as well! Thanks again for the kind words everyone! :)

Holy shit. I haven't thought about KoL in years. I'm amazed it's still around.
---
They totally should have one of the TNT domes have a bunch of Nuka Cola recipes hidden in it.
---
This has actually been in the game since launch. Here is an image from the data files of the very first beta showing that this bow has been in here the entire time

Hi, honey!! 🥰🥰

They refused to give me back mine.

Adrenal reaction and carnivore for your meat

Hey babe 😘😘

It would be great if you could put a level limit on who can buy what, and a limit on the number of items per customer.

Wtf they did it for me numerous times, keep at them till they cave in!!

Not a helmet, but doesn't the veil of secrets?

It's confusing as hell.

I see no whining just some1 disagreeing with bethesda path i guess if i think a movies shit i shouldnt say how bad it was cuz its only 10 bucks and itd just be whining and this game does desperatly need content

Most likely the day you subscribe to the service

I guess there just aren't enough players. When NW released it was fast and every game had 50 players... last times I played it has varied between 20 and 40, while taking far longer to matchmake.

Pointless ITV.
---
Yup same. There's usually around 10 online on my list, and since we are all from northern Europe we literally almost end up 3-4 people on the same server, just by joining adventure mode.
---
I'll give them a try next time I guess. First time this happened was months ago, left very frustrated with support and didn't bother with them the next time it happened.
---
GOOD CALL 😤 
---
Gosh I was really hoping for anything new. Even if terribly small.
---
The perks we get retroactively once legendary player update arrives will do just this.
---
Hahaha, I was going to call it Johnny, but was too obvious
---
Sure whats the discord?
---
So no new content, cool!
---
Speed Demon is great on any build, and since you're melee I'd also recommend Grounded and Scaly Skin to make yourself a bit tankier.
---
That was solid advice for customers.
---
And that’s STILL behind a paywall
---
Because Bethesda doesn't know how to fix it, sees it as low priority or just doesn't care.
---
And the CMs are quite obviously not allowed to talk about anything controversial or which Bethesda has chosen to ignore (see the mountain of beta bugs that still somehow exist).
---
I don't blame them (the CMs) at all, since they are literally being told "this is what you're allowed to say/comment on". Nothing else makes any sense.
---
Yeah but it's only like skins and stuff I'm pretty sure. So who cares.
---
Yea Todd said we would get stuff like private worlds at e3
---
Case and point https://youtu.be/qIGkwnp8ywk
---
looks... rad.... i need this this.
---
tbh this would make a huge impact on the game and would definitely need to be test server'ed.
---
Hopefully they will allow fallout 1st players to get more perk points
---
That's super close to my character with pipe revolver rifles. I use a BE and an IE. I mainly roll with the IE out, and when it doesn't kill in one hit I quick switch to the BE.
---
The perks are super close. I have 3 less luck (which I assume is just mysterious savior) put 2 of those points on crack shot and one on concentrated fire, both under perception. I also switch between nerd rage and 3\* adrenaline because I can't decide what's more effective yet.
---
edit to add more info on this uncommon build: I actually ended up running 3 pipe revolver rifles because of reload time and how fast they break. At first I would use licensed plummer but at high levels you need the extra damage points on those cards. So I have 2 instigating explosive and 1 bloodied explosive. Not even joking, kill the SBQ a lot and collect up repair kits. The prr's break pretty fast.
---
You'll probably end up switching you endurace card for each situation. If you're around others and might die, revenant might be best. If you're alone in the bog, fireproof might be better. I also like 2\* rejuvenated but some people hate managing it. Maybe 1\* radicool and 1\* cola nut. A nuka grape can save your ass in a ghoul swarm.
---
edit 2 lmao: I didn't notice at first, but I would take that serendipity down to 1\* and use the other 2 points for a 3\* class freak.
---
I've forgotten that weapon. That's a really cool name
---
And a Fallout 1st exclusive... the mutation visuals will sell as skins in the Atomic Shop for 1675 each.
---
lol
---
Remain human! Don't support the enclave and their terrible research!
---
Dont think so
---
I know about the record, were the textures and meshes in the files before though? I'm looking through the main .ba2 archive and I don't see it.
---
You really believe that you know Bethesda gonna make the game more p2w they leaked ranger armor in fo 1st like it will have it's own stats with bonuses
---
Dude, relax. I like the hunting rifle better. Call it personal preference or an opinion, you’re still talking to me like I’m stupid. I have a b/e/90, a b/10, and a b/ffr/ag lever gun. I still keep going back to the hunting rifle. It will one shot a sheepsquatch with a crit headshot, which none of my lever guns can do. The perforating mag obviously stacks on top of tank killer.
---
Introducing the new CAMP Budget Visibility Kits!  Available now for only 117 atoms!
---
She was interacting with him on Instagram in Feb of 2018 so don't know why she's telling people they met playing Fallout. Maybe that's when they really started to get to know one another but she's known him longer than she's making it seem.
---
Such a minimalist inside the vault article
---
If he's not running Class Freak, the -50 AP from Scaly Skin might be a deal breaker.
---
Yes, been wearing that for many months.  It fits the request.
---
The fun fact of mysterious savior is it stacks with revenant. I always have the savior on due to bloodied, but that extra 50% of dam is also super nice.
---
I like your coverage , you're one of the good ones. People here gonna start shit no matter what.
---
Heh, true.  It'd be nifty if rocks/slag were some kind of high-volume, low cost, low damage variant-  The .38 ammo of thrown items.  Maybe you get two or three slag lumps for a piece of steel scrap, and the results scrap down to nothing.  It'd be amusing if rendered metal ores produced throwable slag lumps (that scrap down to nothing) as a side effect, too.
---
Yeah, I'd love to see more thrown items.  Craftable javelins or spears, maybe, that require higher weapons perks to build and are more competitive with higher-level weapons.
---
Hahaha... Way to keep the sarcasm in theme.
---
Thank you for being rational
---
I have 0 desire to have visual effects for my mutations. Pass.  
---
Also, did you mean non-feral ghouls are passive/mostly passive? Because in the 3 fallout games I've played, feral ghouls have always been hostile.
---
I know now, should check the rest of this thread my friend.
---
No, that's a terrible idea, and entering into the realm of ACTUAL P2W, not just pay for convenience like everything so far has been.
---
I have the Raiders mask and it does not give me -2 perception and I wear it all the time
---
Yeah I wasn't even sure if I should post it but heh, whatever.
---
PC smallest player base. An many people like myself have left the game until new content or for good.
---
You're putting the burden of blame or the OP, and not another person posting something completely irrelevant. I'm not saying for OP to expect everyone to post cutesy comments, but if you're commenting and it's irrelevant and unwarranted, that's on the commenter. We should know better than to do that shit.
---
Grounded, carnivore , scaly skin, and speed demon for sure. Maybe electrically charged or adrenal reaction depending on your build and playstyle.
---
Talons isn't applicable to two-handed melee. It doesn't hurt anything unless you find yourself wanting for more AP, in which case see if you can lose it to get those AGI points back.
---
Healing factor does cut down on your stimpack use, but you get such a damage boost with Fury and X-Cell that the negative effects to chem effectiveness with that mutation could outweigh the benefit.
---
K and don't really care tbh I'm just into the game to grind do missions and mess around with friends. Not gona be spending money on the game so I'll be grinding for my stuff. If they put in stuff that gives you stats and stuff that's fine. It's not like pvp matters in this game anyways.
---
Well, she was interacting with him on Instagram in Feb of 2018 so don't know why she's telling people they met playing Fallout. Maybe that's when they really started to get to know one another but she's known him longer than she's making it seem.
---
Yea they have been there for a very very long time. check out SeventySix - Meshes02.ba2
---
They've pretty much minimized operations outside the Wastelanders stuff from the looks of things.  Not a big surprise after all, since it's behind schedule.
---
This is a great post apocalyptic role playing game.
---
Actually it doesn't, it has a rather different design, except for the common elements since both of these bows are compound bows.
---
Most face coverings seem to work, i use a camo bandana.
---
Due to the cheaters, I left PC for PS4 about a month after NW launched. The frame rates suck compared to PC, but the experience is much better.
---
Wouldn't it be cool if you could send them to The Greenbrier?
---
Strange that [this](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Veil_of_Secrets) one doesnt seem to have a pricetag. I'm sure its still p2w tho.
---
She was interacting with him on Instagram in Feb of 2018 so don't know why she's telling people they met playing Fallout. Maybe that's when they really started to get to know one another but she's known him longer than she's making it seem. Two years is a lot less crazy to me than less than one.
---
I wish you were right... but there is obviously a large enough audience who either (a) doesn't care about anything but a single aspect (say building) and is willing to overlook any number of bugs or (2) rabidly loves Fallout/Bethesda and is staying no matter how bad this dumpster fire becomes.
---
Even when... I honestly wish I could say if... Wastelanders is VERY light on content, full of old bugs and new and has most of the "exciting" stuff behind at least one if not two paywalls (Fallout 1st), they will stay and make excuses.
---
It just won't matter to them. They get what they want, even if it's a giant plate of bugs with a small side dish of whatever content they enjoy. And they will keep pumping just enough cash into BGS in the form of Fallout 1st and paid atomic shop purchases that it can keep limping along indefinitely with the skeleton crew that's operating it now.
---
Sounds great.

Need more?
---
That's true, sprinting and power attacks are pretty important for melee.  If you use Ultra-Light armor and have a decent amount of Agility then you might be able to get away with not using Class Freak though.
---
I don't mod legendaries that I'm selling, unless its to make the armor pieces ultralight.
---
Those I'm not sure of, but he was able to do the diploma, flag, poster and stash box
---
Interesting, I haven't even considered those, I may need to reassess my wardrobe.
---
It’s gotten out of hand with the disrespect and choke taunting of the fallout 76 1st member. Can’t wear their first outfits and show their emotes without being retaliated against. Game is still great no matter all the bugs it’s faces. Feeling the patches will be coming soon to eradicate the bugs
---
Without Class Freak, you'll want to avoid Egg Head (-3 S and -3 E), Bird Bones (-4 S) and Wagle Wyes (-4)
---
And how many blue screens?
---
I like the idea of some sort of contested zone or zones. For some reason Warhammer Online comes to mind. We definitely need a multi-faction pvp, as in, at least 3 or more factions. Just no fkn special pvp specific gear/crap like they did in ESO.
---
Why were you amazed? This is their SOP so far... talk up the "good", ignore anything else and keep on trucking.
---
I don't expect them to mournfully lament the awful state of the game in ITV, but it would go such a long way to building any sense of goodwill to admit at least some of their failures.
---
Not even a sniff of Patch 15. Come onnnnn...
---
I don't see this as a bug, but an awesome feature.
---
There should be a crown or tiara for 1st members so we can show off our monocles.
---
Yeah for you but I'm a pvp player well was but they took survival away sad times but you should care because there not keeping there promise of only cosmetics even tho you dont buy the stuff you should still stand against a once beloved company now hated by many.
---
It's all about perspective!
---
Add healing factor and consider adrenal reaction.
---
Electrically charged is OK, but can be hazardous in a mob if it hits a lot of ghouls at once and you are low on health.  And sometimes it fires after the last critter is dead.
---
\&gt;  I mostly use melee weapons 
---
twisted muscles gave you a big hit on ballistic accuracy, so I'm guessing you are using energy weapons?   If so, avoid grounded, as although it reduced electrical damage received, it alos reduces effectiveness of energy weapons.
---
caveat: class freak maxed will offset a high percentage of the negative effects.  make sure you have starched genes2.  Both are luck perks.
---
Can't speak to scaly skin - haven't tried that one yet.
---
Additionally, even in a nuke zone, do not use full strength radx/radaway.  Use diluted.  (full strength suppresses your mutation, diluted does not).  Alternately, use grape or cherry nukacola, both of which remove a large amount of rads and do not affect mutations.
---
unless you have the recipie, find a vendor with low cost serums and keep a backup of whatever mutations you have.  
---
At some point, you may swap out starched genes for something else, and forget to swap back (I've done this when crafting).  If that happens, the next time you pop (even a diluted) radaway, you'll lose a mutation.
---
This makes it a half of a month of no insight into new development of any kind. Kinda sucks.
---
I'm on xbox too, if i go to nuclear winter and come back to adventure it stops working. if i go to the atom shop the bag is there but it I can't select it as drop or death bag, but i clicked on it a bunch of times and it is working again
---
Blind corners work great for ambushing. ;)  and im sure it would include parts of the bog.
---
I've been seeing these articles around and when I log in we seem to be all nice to each other like always. Got me confused. I got the first subscription out of curiosity and I haven't been harassed and I'm in no mood to harass anybody.
---
Yes!
---
Every 30 days you get atoms. Because you got the package for 360 days fixed. Every 30 days counts as a month, like all other mmorpg since the dawn of man kind.
---
Not surprised about the Skeleton outfit and skull mask being the most popular costume , its probably the easiest to get, since the random encounter for it is so common.
---
I myself sported the impersonator Sheepsquatch outfit.
---
Holy crap!  This article containing merely the Halloween event statistics and a throwaway NW reminder was foretold earlier this morning, here on Reddit.  This would be funny, but unfortunately, it's really just sad.  Odds on a patch or Holiday event before the New Year?
---
Not even a comment on if patch 15 is coming this decade? 
---
The stats are fun but they shouldn’t be the whole article. If there is nothing to write about tell us that. All there is plenty to talk about just pick a new weapon that gets added in Wastelanders and talk about that.
---
Just checked, you're right.
---
That's kinda my point. Everything in fo76 is supposed to be on reclamation day.
---
hazmat suit
---
Baaaaaaaa baaaaaa. Sheep.
---
It might be unwarranted but it’s not irrelevant to the subject matter. I’m not blaming OP for anything, I’m not “blaming” *anyone* for anything as I don’t see where anyone has done anything wrong (I’d say rude comments are uncalled for, but I haven’t seen any). OP didn’t do anything wrong by making a post, and comments giving opinions aren’t wrong either. That’s what discussion threads are for. If OP didn’t want anything but agreement, they should have put something in the body of the post saying they didn’t want any constructive criticism, or just not posted at all.
---
Good plan. I like it.
---
hazmat suit has worse drawbacks than a gas mask tho...
---
Pvp is fucked in this game. Bunch of mongs jumping like kangaroos and Tesla rifles that glitch out and make them invincible, and the exploited assassins sentinal garbage. Theres no fucking skill in that shit. Fix your shit Bethesda, your charging a subscription so if shit doesnt get fixed from now on, your going to hemorrhage players till the only ones who are left playing this game are the fucking testers.
---
Kinda hard to have a build when your perk cards suck. I also suppose j should have a purpose built NW character.
---
I hate to be correct
---
*“They can’t take out all of us!” will look beautiful etched into almost one million tombstones.*  
---
I see what you did there.
---
Oh, you monster! LOL
---
like how hard it is to sneak around in, or how much it affects berserkers?
---
Well that makes sense. As long as Yearly get their atoms.
---
2 weeks in a row of totally punting on the ITV
---
Fahrenheit (451/76/476/etc.)
---
I think we're dealing with a vocal minority here. Literally no one I play with online has an issue with it, and about 25% of them have FO1st.
---
The only time I catch shit about it is when I express support for on here and only by a few people who are extremely rude about it which makes me think they're just living their life as a massive jerk.
---
But i play as a Ghoul! Whys everyone down on ghouls? Hopefully you mean feral ghouls...
---
Any attempt to rile people up or smear a company or seems they will take...not that Bethesda doesn’t deserve sone shit posting against them.
---
Ah, yeah it can get repetative feeling. Vats, headshot. Vats, headshot. The whole game becomes the same feeling. I like my commando too, but that's why I have 4 toon builds lol
---
Inside the Vault has never been for addressing bugs or stuff though? It's always been more of a newsletter.
---
I was really hoping they’d comment on 1st
---
I would be fine with them never communicating with the community again ever.. if they would just fix a couple bugs now and again...
---
They couldn’t handle vault raids, so....no.
---
So people who criticize dumb moves by Bethesda are trolls. Gotcha.
---
IGN, Eurogamer, Polygon, Gamesradar, the fans on this sub, the content creators... all trolls!
---
Sure you are. Just like you're formulating a response to all the Fallout 1st hurt and the reappearance of old bugs etc... As predicted, nothing mentioned in today's ITV.
---
nice math, harder to factor in not every server is full and not everyone participates  in each instance
---
Does stabilized seriously provide that much of a boost? With a flamer in particular.
---
Buuut there terrible research makes me feel really strong and stuff
---
The problem is that at level 1 armor or 80 the affixed Assassins Sentinel still does the same thing. You'd never Replace your lvl 50 Assassins Sentinel armor with level 80 Nocturnal armor for example..
---
“4.5 minutes” would be the average time if it didnt take 30s to interact with every fucking object in the event
---
You don't need talons for 2 handed melee, it only works with "unarmed".  You should probably cure that one as it's giving you a -4 agi penalty before class freak for exactly 0 benefit.  
---
But overall:
---
* Speed demon is hard to give up once you've used it and it definitely amplifies marsupial by enabling you to cover a lot more ground per jump.  
---
* Carnivore imo is great as it frees you from having to worry about food ever again. 
---
* Scaley skin is good if you don't care about ap but it makes perks like dodgy and VATS less effective.
---
* grounded is good if you don't use energy weapons 
---
* adrenal reaction is mandatory if you are bloodied but otherwise can be passed up
---
* electrically charged, plague walker and unstable isotope proc quite a bit for melee characters but imo they are unnecessary though some people like them.
---
* healing factor is good for builds that don't use chems frequently.
---
* herd mentality is amazing for people who are almost always on a team.
---
* chameleon is ok if you have a full set of weightless armor but imo not game changing.  at least there's no downside.
---
Congratulations on your upcoming nuptials! my best wishes to your and your future!!!
---
Somewhat unrelated, here are some Fallout 76 wedding jokes that came to mind when I read your post. These are not meant to roast you. More like jabs at Bethesda.
---
\*Will the ceremony begin as normal and then shut down and boot everyone from the venue?
---
\*Did the wedding planners offer a very nice and expensive memento to your guests that turned out to be cheaply made and of very poor quality?
---
\*Did the wedding planner promise you a price and then decide to charge guests extra for the option to sit at a table alone?
---
Again, I send my best wishes. I hope my jokes aren't too inflammatory. I just couldn't pass the opportunity.
---

Thank you for your wonderful contribution. How could you say something so controversial yet so brave?
---
I want to refer you to this post:

---
I recently put my YouTube channel on private so the videos may not be available to you anymore. 
---
My main "pull" is to get folks to my CAMP. From there, there's 30 or so quests we run.
---
sure, but nerf them to make them inline with other weapons.  It's shitty game design for one class of weapons to outperform everything else by a massive amount.
---
Ill give PA and Heavies a shot since it seems anything I want involves stealth or an excessive amount of BS
---
I wonder if they raised everyone's HP by 5x and raised the amount of damage every monster does by 5x would it make PvP more viable?
---
I don't have any problems on PC like you are describing and I'm on a off the shelf HP laptop from costco...
---
good luck with Your problems
---
you win! lol :)
---
True,  but I didn't see one server that didn't do the event. If anything,  the actual active number of players may be south of 70k.
---
The percentages apply after one another, not additive
---
This is wonderful! I would like to join this small motion on PC.   
---
My ign is Ms.Sandy
---
Yeah this would be great.  Imo there's no need to make it an area on the regular map, instead use instances.  So basically a pvp event spawns where players choose a side and then whoever wins it influences the world map.    
---
So if the raiders win, raider npc's man additional checkpoints in the divide.  IF settlers win, they gain those checkpoints.
---
i cant dispute that, peak est times i can switch characters at least once a night and randomly come back to the same server, that’s gotta be single digit servers
---
I still don't see how refigerators or repair kits are pay to win. Premium passes and subscriptions for added benefits are a thing in pretty much every single online game out there. People dodn't want to pay for extra content anymore, companies had to find other avenues to help pay for extra content, you cannot have your cake and it eat it too.
---
You could try to submit a ticket here: https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10
---
I will be frank though, they probably will not refund you the atoms but I could be surprised.
---
Running a pretty old Dell with a 3ghz i5 processor and a GTX970 with minimal issues
---
I'm going to disagree with you on the last couple of sentences. If people weren't complaining, Beth would be fucking you harder than they already are.
---
Why haven't you?
---
In the case of the super mutant bit, the West Tec facility did have a solution which would render the FEV virus...sterile? What I mean is it no longer could mutate. Perhaps if anything we could get our hands on it and inject it. From there it would be a matter of treatments with radaway, blood transfusions with blood bags, and doses of that distiller to return to normal.
---
Before the game came out I had actually wanted to be able to become a super mutant with high intelligence and charisma. I do recall a cut concept from Fallout 4's BoS that included Super Mutant BoS soldiers. Essentially the Brotherhood had managed to stabilize and "cure" super mutants. Their skin took a more greyish coloration, their hair started growing back in, and they were as intelligent as your average knight. Course that cut concept also had the BoS recruiting ghouls for high radiation operations.
---
Haven’t played the mode since I unlocked the big stash box. I would 100% play NW again if i didn’t have to sit in a loading screen and room for three minutes with everyone running around in complete chaos. I’ll often run out of things to do in Adventure, and the thought of playing NW will cross my mind, but the damn loading times...every other BR out there takes half the time it takes to actually get boots on the ground.
---
You can try out various combinations here:   [https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html)
---
Programming procedurally generated dungeons without an insane amount of lag/ constant crashing is actually pretty difficult. Especially if it is random for every player.
---
Damn seriously, did the guy not know what he had lol
---
The next build I wanna do is a vampire limb damage shotgun (combat or pump). Cripple everything and stay at max health. Think that would be fun (maybe run around with no armor or wood armor to make things really interesting).
---
Yeah, Sale items and items with X number of days left. I only saw the red and white lights I posted about because I was idly looking through the shop in a bored moment, and it's a limited time offer. Buried halfway down the CAMP tab. Not a great way to promote.
---
If stabilized works with a flamer(I havent specifically tested this but it should), then yea it would increase your damage a good bit on armored enemies. Depends on how much damage its doing per hit.
---
 I'm not entirely sure on the math involved, but damage resistance determines how much of your damage is "negated." If your doing less or the same damage as the enemies damage resistance number, a lot of your damage will be totally negated. So you want as much armor penetration as possible with guns that have low per shot damage.
---
 If you were doing like 1000 damage against a 100dr then no it would add very little damage, but flamers are high fire rate with low damage numbers.
---
Why did you guys stealth nerf events to give less rewards? Most events don't drop a single cap!
---
That would just mean even fewer players. If you average two per event,  that's 38k.  Three per event is 26k. Those are scary small numbers.
---
The point isn't how much it costs, it's that there's only one option and it comes with content that should be in the game. They should be making quests and shit for these QOL items and just charge for the private world's, but instead they added content to it to charge even more and appeal to more lazy folks
---
I'd love to see the active effects on the favorites menu added to Adventure as well, it's really useful to see that at a glance without having to open up the Pip-Boy.
---
Had to double check this after reading the title. My ex left me 2 weeks before our wedding for a guy she met on FO76. She literally had known him days. She left the country, haven’t seen her since.
---
The atomic shop space suit has the perk and doesn't remove any perception as well but I'm pretty sure it's a bug, could be wrong though.
---
The forums.
---
Xbox! Even peak times they seem empty, maybe I'm pinning the blame on beth too much. Must be something on my end!
---
I have. but I still see the subreddit pop up on occasion and it's the same ol complaints a year later. 
---
I played this game since beta and my "goodwill" ran out
---
You should drop a bullet or piece of junk after you do something important or get a good drop. It will update/save to the server and then if you get disconnected you don't lose anything. Every player should know this, maybe a huge sticky at the top of the forum, but that's only for people here...
---
And yet the ultracite is an improved T-51, makes no sense
---
Thank you very much! Her and I are both very excited and very happy!😃
---
That's exactly what I'm like most of the time I'll go to fortnite for a quick game but it's not as fun.
---
I wish you and your husband to be all the best
---
just tested my BE handmade with the powerful automatic receiver. at 19% health im at 365 dmg, at 14% im at 375, at 9% its 385 and at 4% im at 395
---
He's actually 100% here. It wasn't perfect but it was leaps and bounds better than "Nuclear Winter" and the not-actually-happening Wastelanders of 2019.  
---
(Coming later, yes, but that's a huge content drought.)
---
*also requires a fallout 1st subscription
---
Pretty much you get 1,650 atoms each month as a yearly. I been keeping track of 
---
atoms.
---
lol! I was totally gonna do a berserker build with shotguns next. Got an explosive pump and I was thinking it would be like super hard mode
---
I played the game with 750ti 1GB with less crashes than the others at launch.
---
Believe it or not but I used to do that especially in the very early-dodgy server days.
---
Honestly haven’t had a server disconnect in quite a while so I kinda got a bit lax.  Won’t be making that mistake again😂
---
With a full suit of unyielding armor and 19% health, the pies are uncommon instead of unicorn rare. I’ll usually interact with a machine while looting junk, and I’ve certainly eaten dozens of slices at this point.
---
Camo jumpsuit and camo bandana look great with a black cowboy hat.
---
I went to Fright Night wearing my ranger coat. No one gave a single fuck, with like 20 people there.
---
It's just games urinalists trying to stir up shit, injecting their politics again.
---
This is why, by and large, game reviews are nearly worthless.  I remember the good days when a game was reviewed and we got solid information.
---
I miss those days.
---
Don't forget to count the NW playerbase, during event there's a ton of people farming seasonal rewards. I'm PC player and even with cheaters problem I don't wait more than 2 minutes for finding game, and see different nicknames in the lobby.
---
They don’t have anything to say. The game is basically in maintenance mode. They are just waiting to see how Fallout Worst is selling before they put more resources in developing new content. And it is probably not selling well.
---
Maintenance mode means actually fixing bugs and right now there’s still Day One bugs. Soooo nah they’re in money grabbing mode. Pay up for those buggy addition to an already buggy game. 
---
They fucked this IP so hard. Should have left it to Obsidian. 
---
Also, NEVER SHOULD HAVE COME HERE
---
**I'd love to see this...** however, they can't even fix the bugs we have let alone add something new.
---
When's the divorce?
---
Ooh! Have ya heard about [West of Loathing](http://westofloathing.com/), pardner?
---
role playing factions still only gives the person who took the workshop, and people in his/her/it's party access. 
---
Faction based PVP could allow access to the resources to everyone aligned with that faction, which would not require them to group with whatever person took the zone to begin with.   Faction based, not group based.
---
I play it alot actually like almost every night for hours
---
Never going to happen, that requires more money from us and less work from them. Don’t expect anything extra, aside from planed content updates.
---
Haven't played in months.
---
More and more I don't think there will ever be enough content for me to justify spending anywhere near the time I did. The engine is just to easy to break and exploit. I played NW a lot. It was fun. But to many cheaters.
---
I got a lot out of the game though. Most of it came from the people I played with though.
---
&gt; Bethesda doesn't care
---
I have a hunch that there's nobody there now.  They've got a skeleton crew to push Wastelanders out, but the rest they're going to leave as is.  
---
~~When's the last time we heard from anyone official on this sub?~~
---
I use a instigating +50% limb damage hunting rifle.  Can confirm its a great weapon to shoot stuff in the legs with especially legendaries while you wait for others to tag them since they just limp along.
---
100%! Give us some goddamn variety!
---
One small correction to an otherwise perfect post. Full strength radaway does not suppress mutations.
---
It's difficult for them to add anything to this game...
---
Here's Johnny
---
Capitalism is inherently unethical, since profit relies on exploitation via unfair exchange.
---
Two reasons:
---
1. I want to finish the main quest.  
---
2. I'm broke and can't afford any other games right now.  
---
3. Most of my spare time is going to finding another job, so I don't have hours to spend on a new game.
---
4. Shitty Fallout (Fallout Seventy Shits?) is still Fallout. 
---
todo: fix bug where list count is inaccurate
---
I don't know how rampant it is, I'm on Xbox and it isn't so bad and I don't really care for battle Royale game modes... but everybody I know on PC has experienced getting one-shot through walls and impossible plays of a single person racking up dozens of kills in mere moments, plus YouTube has a TON of videos of people cheating. Which, of course, is anecdotal... but it seems to be a thing.
---
I will have to try this
---
2 hours ago
---
Baby steps.
---
They are still trying to get the instancing tech incorporated and working smoothly. Procedural content would require that first. 
---
I could see it added to the game in a few ways. A new game mode or computer sim. Could also be a Fallout take on the "Cube" movies set in Vaults. 
---
I do think though if they did they would try to make it separated from the primary game so they can say it isn't DLC and charge everyone, subs and not, alike.
---
Dude, when it "works" and you have a good group, it can be sooooooo fucking fun...
---
They want you to pay like them.
---
I hang my head in shame and withdraw that part of my comment.
---
Well you sure are pleasant
---
You can't run both, so you have to decide before accidentally getting one or the other naturally.  Carnivore ftw tho.
---
That was only to shut ppl up for a short time now it's back to like it was at launch but they not getting as much hate so no need.
---
Enclave propaganda

I got two perfectly preserved pies in a two week span, including one on my first attempt.

---
Have an upvote my dude.  I liked the part where you asked for free stuff then insulted everyone for not going along with it.  Classic.
---
Yeah I hear you....Ps4 pro and I still experience blue screen crashes at least once a game session usually a couple in menu freeze up resulting in shutting down the game and restart. Server disconnect etc. Now I still really like the game but it's buggy as shat..never would I consider fallout first with the game in this kind of shape
---
If on Xbox please invite to in-game ceremony.
---
Watch them sell this back to us....
---
TSE is a good drop for support builds - explosive shotguns with Enforcer or TSE heavy weapons with One Gun Army cripple and stagger amazingly well. An explosive Vampire's shotgun can heal a player from 0 to 300hp in a few good hits, and an explosive high-fire rate low-damage gun with the Suppressor's effect can do a lot to help with other players survivability when swarmed by mobs (spraying around, tagging enemies with the edge of explosive shots)
---
edit: I know I wrote about Vampire's and Suppressor's as well as Two-Shot - the Explosive effect is the real hero, even if the damage has been nerfd a bit
---
As a 1st player, I would be ok with that. In fact, if we only got the atoms, tent, private world and the mentioned atom shop discounts that have yet to materialize, that would be cool with me. But I'm one of those idiots who pay for the privilege of making bethesda greedy aparently... The $13/month is dumb. $10/month or $100/year is fine.
---
yea, I forgot about speed demon!  
---
I agree - Its one of those if you don't have it, you don't know what you are missing, but if have it and lose it, you'll miss it immediately.
---
thanks :) 
---
correction noted.
---
Been like that since launch on here few times it gets negative then dies off then tons of overly best game ever, met my soulmate post.
---
 Wait what??? You’re not going to sue them for having a fallout themed wedding?? Guess you guys aren’t that low. Yet.
---
&gt;Next Thursday will be one year since release, and they're scraping the bottom for newsletter content.
---
Nonsense.
---
They'll have statistics for the entire year to discuss. 😂
---
(But really, you *would* think that next week would be kind of a big deal.  But it's completely muted by Wastelanders getting pushed back).
---
I dont remember that in the trailer. Was it the wastelanders trailer?
---
This is your second post not being able to spell “Non” pretty simple bud.
---
They do have things to talk about, though. They’re just too scared to say anything about it.
---
It maybe the other way around 18 up and 200 down? Far as your pc losing frames, getting it all dialed in (overclocking, game setts) is part of it. Wireless works if the equipment is decent. You could run cat 6 down to the router for testing.
---
Idk if it's fake, had a posse of three attack me with the bear costume head last night cause i was wearing the ranger outfit although i didn't retaliate due to all three of them running a shotgun + explosive setup and i run melee. Maybe not as big a deal as most people make it out to be (first time it's happened to me aside from the "oh, wow, a fallout 1st subscriber" comment from someone) but yeah, probably happens. don't see the biggie though, jus don't attack and there's nothing they can do lmao
---
That’s crazy!!
---
This is a great story . I wish you all the love in the world . Don't name  the kids Nuka-Cowla or sugar bombs ... 🤣👍👍 Greetings from Belgium
---
Thank you!! We thought about Daddy-0 and vault boy!
---
Awesome now we will be able to buy the super mutant mutation or the mole rat mutation for only $14.99! Or if you want a ghoul that mutation will be $15.99
---
"Here's Johnny!", John Torrence, or (John/Johnny)'s axe; in honor of the scene from 'The Shining" where Jack Nicholson chops through the door. That way you're playing into the 'instigating' part as well.
---
Completely agree bought the big Nuka sings and they're too expensive to place
---
At this point I can't wait for the thing to die so maybe we'll see some rogue servers crop up.
---
For real.
---
Selling scrap is how i make the bulk of my caps.  I dont need infinite scrap.
---
It already is P2W
---
They said they're working on having both maps in rotation
---
Because that would eliminate 90% of the crying over 1st. And they need to cry about everything Bethesda does. 
---
They don’t actually want it fixed, they just wanna rage quit, repeatedly uninstall the game, claim they’ve been playing since before beta and tell us they’ll never play another Bethesda game. Cry about how anyone who likes the game is ruining everything in their lives. And lie about performance issues like how the game CTD 237 times in a five minute span. 
---
They just want to start shit, for no other reason than to start shit.
---
Eh, just a fan of their games and style... when... you know, it works. Bethesda has provided me with... fuck, just... a ridiculous amount of fun over the years. Guess I'm loyal to a bit of a fault, though that loyalty is admittedly waning.
---
Edit: Just realized you were probably responding to other dude, my bad.
---
&gt; You'd never Replace your lvl 50 Assassins Sentinel armor with level 80 Nocturnal armor for example..
---
All the have to do is change the  percentages again.  They changed the sentinel and assassins modifiers from 100 percent chance to 75 percent chance. So the percentages could correspond to level.  Level 1 sent assassins gives a maybe 10 percent chance, level ten gives 20 percent, etc. And level 80 gives an 80 percent chance.
---
Way to try to ruin someones moment you absolute cunt
---
Tons of ppl have performance issues with this game post saying works fine for me. 
---
Ppl saying that for rdr2 also does that mean the game isn't well optimized.
---
I7 4790k
---
GTX 1080 I have some issues also.
---
I wouldn't get optimistic. Most likely it is just receiver mods, like every other weapon with alternate ammo types.
---
Xbox one x and have more issues than that and everyone I know that's played recently same issues.
---
Not everyone has the same problems.
---
Haha yes the other dude indeed.. sarcasm for him you sir are actually legitimately pleasant.
---
More than adding new armor, couldn't supermutants use  power armor without frame?
---
Lmao, We're gonna build our own bunkers... with Equality and Liberty.
---
Asking the important questions
---
fair enough.  That said I imagine they could replace beam splitter with some other mod that doesn't amplify the # of explosive effects per shot.
---
Though iirc explosive in general does more damage with energy weapons than other weapons and if so, they need to bring energy weapons down to the 20% level everything else is at.
---
It did sting quite a bit. I have been doing OK in other drops and got a Bloodied Explosive .50 cal so that took the edge off it but still...
---
The media figured out that the largest number of people attached to this game (and many other games) are people who don't play it but are perversely interested in bad news about it.
---
That's why places like Forbes and Wapo have started news coverage of video games. They figured out it was the only type of news left they hadn't exploited.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/drx109/comment/f6nmqvi here ya go
---
C’mon Bethesda, quit doing stuff! You did a thing and so I’m gonna rage quit and uninstall the game for the 30th time this week!
---
Like... I get why people feel that way, don't get me wrong, but I'm not there yet. I see too much potential, have had too much fun in those rare, rare, jesus-fucking-christ-rare-like-a-still-mooing-steak moments it all works right.
---
He means ferals would largely ignore the Ghoul PC, as we've heard from some of the intelligent Ghouls we've met...
---
Like the Ian Malcolm of the wasteland

Your processor is too old there. The min on this game is a 6XXX

I give 76 a bit of a pass because it was essentially a side project lumped onto a woefully unprepared dev team that never got the chance to catch up, nor the support they desperately needed from the big BGS. The world is well designed, I had 105 hours of mostly fun, then I was just... done really.
---
The next BGS title will probably seal their fate for me
---
I'm not so sure I would call the raid power armor a failed addition. PVPers are buying tons of sets. Every instance of damage adds a stack of poison. A single explosive harpoon with fletchettes mod adds a shit ton of stacks immediately. Damn near kills you at full health. I get to actually fight against the cheapest stuff.
---
If 10% of people that bought the game also bought the sub for one month..
---
Bethesda would stand to make 1.5
---
million for just one month, tell me
---
how that's a bad business model?! 
---
1.4 million copies of the game sold is
---
140k people at 10 % = 1.68 Million! At
---
5% its still 840k for just one month
---
and that's just for the FO1st subscription!
---
That doesn't include atom sales or
---
new copies sold....just paying the intial $60 isn't enough to keep the game going for years...that takes money, want bugs fixed? Want new content?  It all cost money, no one is forcing you to pay anything other than the original price you bought the game for. I am choosing to be a firster to help the game grow, so all players can enjoy the same story content together. Bring on the downvotes.
---
Lol at least someone is finding bugs. Lord know Bethesda isn’t.
---
any Bloodborne fans here?  something like the Chalice Dungeons would be amazing
---
With 18 down I’m not surprised. What’s your latency and jitter?
---
Edit: hardwire and see if that fixes it?
---
While this is cool i doubt it would be implemented at this level of detail
---
You'd think the NSA wold know...
---
Oh yeah? Well, we've already built our own! With capitalism and... murder... and a mildly psychotic artificial intelligence that wears goggles for some reason and...
---
...ya'll got space in those bunkers?
---
So you believe there's an actual class war going on in-game? A class war that went from attacking subscribers to flipping entirely around (because it was never real, even though they reported on it) and now subscribers are treating people who don't like peasants?
---
Because that's what these totally not garbage, "gaming news," sites are currently reporting.
---
When 4 or more players use it in the NW lobby, ZAX should drop an Angry Mothman on them...
---
yeah long-time 76 players in the trading reddit boards are some of the most greedy people on the planet i swear
---
A smart company would take these opportunities to change the conversation from the current controversies. Releasing a bit of info about the plot of Wastelanders, trailers etc., something that would get people excited and talking about something besides FO1st.
---
Very true....  
---
And some weapons it benefits more than others....  
---
Great example is the  Mr. Handy Buzz Blade.     
---
Limb Damage on a weapon you can VERY easily control where you hit is much better than Swing Speed, which only effects the initial hit and doesn't seem to effect the "continuous" hits.  
---
Limb Damage is AWESOME for AoE Explosive and Flamer style weapons as well.
---
Makes sense. Congratulations :)
---
I'll get over it.
---
Nope. Why? Money. It costs a lot more then you think to get the rights to play songs. Yes they're making money with Fallout 1st and the Atomic Shop but I bet most of it is going to pay the people still working on the game and keeping the servers up and running. In the end they're a company...they want to be in the black, not in the red. We won't see new music...unless their own music producers want to make their own versions of known holiday songs.
---
I mean I'd love some new music in game...not even holiday stuff...just new music in general but...we're not going to get it.
---
Op are you really running a mobile i7-700, or was that supposed to be a 7700? At first I thought you meant 7700, but then I realized what you put is an i7-700, which is a mobile processor from 2009. I hope it's not that...
---
What this post suggests "Inside the Vault" is for, and what is, don't align.  It's a marketing tool intended for promotion, not a confirmation bias tool. We have this subreddit for that.
---
Yet can play vastly more demanding games with cpu heavy task fine. Now OP is CPUs old.
---
Bethesda is a privately held corporation that has lost touch with reality when they charge $100 on top of the $60 for the game.
---
What a fucking shame.
---
&gt;Crying butthurt tantrum assholes
---
are trolls
---
Honestly? I get that, and agree with the mismanagement of how it was created. If the next Elder Scrolls or Fallout doesn't knock it out of the park into another fucking state, I may be with you on that sealed fate thing.
---
Maybe theres more to it that she doesn't want to admit, but i still think its a bit early.. Just my own opinion.
---
Great idea it could be implemented into fallout 4 through mods to show off
---
Most games had basic messages and individual friends lists. Sometimes a text chat function in lobbies.
---
There's still a pretty hefty difference between a L50 and a L150+. The best perks max out after 50, caps acquisition, camp options, crafting perks, ammo stocks.
---
People who tell you stuff like that want to feed you propaganda.
---
https://pediaa.com/difference-between-non-and-none/
---
Can confirm ranger armor is only skin. Lmao all of you kids want free stuff, but what do you contribute to the company for all that content? Nothing! Begone.
---
Yawn.
---
I mean I disagree here.....  Many other games/corporations charge much more for the exact same thing.
---
Migraine
---
I haven't seen any "class war" going on...at least in game. On here, yeah there's some sort of issue going on...people trolling/downvoting anything to do with Fallout 1st.
---
But then again I don't run around advertising I have a subscription. I used the emotes during the Halloween event, but outside of that...I don't run around with the outfit or icons.
---
...literally nobody on this thread has said anything like that? You must be confusing this post with...
---
*checks notes*
---
...err, all... the rest... of them on this sub.
---
In the Fallout 76 lore most raiders *are* aristocrats.
---
&gt; Some of us like the simple exploration of the world
---
I wouldn't generally pay $60 for a buggy walking simulator though
---
why would i want to know about those stats..? it doesnt affect me as player
---
Even when I was first starting out I took everything not nailed down. I always do that in games. Better to have when you don't need, then to not have when you do need.
---
how DARE you ask a valid question!
---
ive noticed alot of unneccessary downvotes recently, i think the anti 1st groups are getting their jollies by downvoting anything and everything
---
I have
---
If you could point us to the scam or lack of ethics we'd be interested.
---
I would love it but that lets be honest that would take a lot of resources or a really dedicated modder/s so we aren't going to get it intill modders can mod their own servers.
---
Let's be real: people won't shut up no matter what until Bethesda finally comments on 1st (and comment *what,* exactly? That it exists?)
---
Maybe I've been lucky. I dunno. Just seems a bit weird I'm constantly reading on Reddit about players firing into the sky and killing the whole server in seconds but encountered nothing that obvious in-game. I've not looked on YouTube though tbf. Looking this game up on YouTube is something I avoid.
---
Shoulda sold those for a few caps each, or scrapped 'em for parts.
---
Stop letting game "journalists" wag the dog. It doesn't exist, so don't waste your time denying it.
---
We will never see Wastelanders.  Called it.
---
They are still radio silent mode waiting for the anger of Fallout 1st to drop, and once it does I'm betting they going to release Ammo Converter for purchase for Fallout 1st members only next lol.
---
It's probably even less general than that; a lot of people can be a massive jerk about one or two subjects, and be completely kind and understanding in all other situations. We all have our knee jerk moments and topics. Doesn't make it right, just human.
---
That's how I paid my way through college. I figured out that I could go to the local pick-n-pull auto salvage yard and pull desirable parts and flip them on ebay or auto forums for profit. I was making 1000% to 2000% profit on most stuff. I was making 2K a month on average.
---
And who isn't those things, according to you? 
---
I have criticized the game. And I continue to do so because I think it can be so much better than this, if Bethesda stops making stupid decisions. But if they keep on this path, your beloved Fallout 76 will follow many other MMOs who decided MTX were more important than content, and are now dead.
---
No we want a real source like someone with a YouTube channel or blogspot that I haven’t heard of before.
---
You are wise to avoid looking stuff up, honestly. And also in fairness, those whom complain on subs or YouTube aren't necessarily representative of any "whole", but there's enough that it should be addressed.
---
They bloom when it's a verdant season in The Mire.  I haven't been able to find how Heart of the Swamp affects it.  They can also bloom if they're nuked (25% chance)
---
I’d say that’s true, but at least it’s in the atom store. I actually spent a week doing in game challenges and got the atoms to buy my fridge for free by playing the game. It’s what irritates me about the tent and stash box (and I say this as a 1st member that has them) that they’re literally locked behind a paywall. There’s no way to play the game to earn them.
---
Let me guess.. Eat the babies? I stopped by your camp the other night [https://imgur.com/sZSOb7z](https://imgur.com/sZSOb7z)
---
How dare you?!?
---
I mean. I tried to play it twice and it was bugged out. So I gave up. Kinda like most of my 76 experience.
---
It’s because Bethesda more than likely has next to zero content mapped out for the remainder of 2019.......
---
My prediction for “content” is the following:
---
1. Christmas Event (plans &amp; outfit rewards)
---
2. 1-2 Double XP weekends
---
3. 1 Purveyor sale 
---
4. Patch 15 to drop end of November or early December 
---
5. 6-7 shitty inside the vaults with next to no information (will talk about upcoming patch 15/Christmas event &amp; how it works &amp; the double xp/purveyor sale)
---
6. 1 or 2 decent inside the vaults pumping up Patch 16 coming early 2020 with some sort of unknown content &amp; I think that’s about it.
---
I hope I’m wrong. I highly doubt we will even get any firm dates for wastlanders or any sort of roadmap with dates in 2019.
---
Your assuming I was one of them, I haven’t played in months
---
Hell all they would need to do is add one human NPC as a random encounter with different selectable dialog options talking about how other people are still out there and we would wet ourselves in excitement. But I guess absolutely nothing is still pretty good too.
---
Yeah they confirmed this for wastelanders. 
---
I just hope they add exclusive rewards/vendors for each faction like raider/settlers skins, PA skins, themed vanity itens for camp and even exclusive perks for each faction.
---
The skull mask and both raider gas masks from the atom shop don't seem to have the -2 perception either. Or if they do they don't mention it in the description
---
Freezer idea is great.
---
If they don't address it, then does it actually exist?
---
Worse the numbers are super low and don't show this game living long. Please keep in mind this is a brand new event with exclusive plans and those are really bad numbers for a AAA game.
---
Well now I just feel like a jerk.
---
I know I target primarily Fallout 1st subscribers when I go Workshop raiding. And yesterday I stumbled upon someone doing the nuke mine duplication glitch, and after ten minutes I was being harassed out of his camp by six Fallout 1st members.
---
So yeah, I think there is. And that's fine, because it is the only interesting thing that will happen in this game until Wastelanders - which is just sad.
---
1.	⁠Christmas Event (plans &amp; outfit rewards)

How are they low?
---
They don't care. Shills will defend them to the dying breath and they know they don't have to communicate. Their gonna hide like cowards. Their usual tactic
---
*anymore (used to big fan)
---
And I think most are kinda the same nowadays
---
I mean what do you expect them to say? They have betrayed loyal fans, they know it and they don't care. There's plenty of people left to milk still. At this point anyone who wants changes should just uninstall the game and hope that there will be enough of us for Bethesda to notice. No amount of talk from both sides will change anything. There will be no good news from Beth and they won't listen to players as long as players keep playing the game.
---
Brb, scraping blown mind off wall.
---
Ah, and this is different propaganda from the journalists?
---
Sorry you failed basic economics. Any game as a service business model requires a steady inflow of cash in order to be sustained. It's literally the people you think should be called out that are the reason you can turn on your computer or console today and play 76 at all. And yes, the bum in the corner who repeatedly harasses the paying customers gets thrown out of the bar. It's no different in literally any other business.
---
For what it's worth that bungalow is actually one of my favorite atomic shop items.  It's so cool and very versatile for building all sorts of fun stuff.  If I had to accidentally click on anything in there I'd be glad it was that and not one of the dumber things XD
---
But as everyone said, submit a ticket, they have a one time buyer's remorse thingy.  Just saying you may regret in the future using that one time service on this.
---
No.  Typical polygon crap.  Does someone have the pie chart handy?
---
I just realized op said 700 not 7700 lol
---
But I don't know of any games more cpu intense than this and FO4?
---
I wish I didn't find this such a fair and likely prediction, but...
---
its just allergies homeboys....... allergic to electrons
---
It's an atom shop issue and suddenly the Bethesda community representatives come running. Alright.
---
If no one buys it they will stop selling it.  Dont be a whale, your monetary support of a bad system directly makes the game worse for others.
---
Then you're not on PC or you're oblivious.
---
Wouldn’t be surprised if the majority of the team has moved to different projects. Battlefront went through something similar prior to the release of battlefield 5. Content was virtually nonexistent, their community transmissions never addressed anything and had no real substance, and though they didn’t outright say it, they implied that they had small resources due to the release of battlefield 5. Since then they’ve turned it around completely, still releasing decent consistent content, making QoL adjustments, and adding features based off feedback (FOR FREE). They’ve really turned it into something great. Fallout seems to be in that same rough patch right now. The only difference is I don’t see Bethesda taking the same approach to fixing the game based off my perception of the past few months. I mean they probably have just enough people to finish out the content they’ve promised already, but I wouldn’t be surprised if this game loses full support by next year. It definitely seems there’s a lack of caring.
---
I dont think so this happens to any valid questions since long before 1st ever was a thing
---
Yeah, but their games actually work.
---
Bethesda read your comment while inflicted by dyslexia
---
Bethesda "Based on feedback from users like HellsNels we will be introducing our Ammo Converters for the community and its a Fallout 1st exclusive where only members can purchase the new utility item!"
---
Painful, but true.
---
We've been given next to nothing to go on for months when it comes to Wastelanders.  I mean, I get that more time is needed, but you intended to have it out *now*, so I'd like to believe you could show us *something* while we wait.
---
No, I was wrong and you pointed it out.  That's not being a jerk, you were just correct.
---
Of course its the only content theyve added in a while that any1 can play
---
Do the math, Joe
---
Well if they tell us all the new utility items for Fallout 1st the hate train will stay active longer then so they waiting for it to die down.
---
Oh there’s a war alright.  War against my desire to play and my system crashing with no room for improvement
---
I’m amazed that they haven’t been doing this. They’ve been updating the world space, so why not do this? You’re absolutely right. People would be all over it.
---
I prefer ffr and not using 5 points on demo. Some people still love them some explosive tho
---
I think the better idea is to set up your vending clearly labeled for noobs, but rig the room with hidden traps you can manually trigger with a switch...then just crouch/hide out in a back room ready to switch on your trap when a high level enters and starts taking stuff. With the map displaying player level, should be a very easy/quick judgement call on who to reign terror down on. ;)
---
Plus then you don't just auto-kill people curious to see what you have or low-levels curious to see what "high level" loot even is...you'll only get the baddies AND you'll get to enjoy their screams in real time.
---
Almost 400K Sentry Bots destroyed. For an event that runs every hour on the hour with 2 sometimes 3 Sentry Bots. That's a lot of people playing. I personally only had time to do the event may 10 times. I'm certain I'm not the only one 
---
Also almost a million deaths sorry arrests totally laughable. Yeah troll away dude troll away
---
I’m hoping Bethesda blows us away with something real cool, but sadly I’m prepared to be disappointed....this has been 3 weeks of shitty inside the vaults - heck, one week they didn’t even do one :(
---
Do you do anything other than troll this sub? Math looks fine from my end so I would like to know what assumptions OP is using to come to his/her conclusion.
---
If you are still giving them goodwill at this point, then you need a moment of reflection.
---
Yep ps4 haha I was just making a point that not everyone deals with that Because not everyone is on pc but there is nothing they can do about hackers  besides ban them when they r reported
---
It’s stupid, really. 
---
If you act like a jack hammer I am probably going to blast you
---
But how else would people know that Bethesda completely ruined your life and single handily destroyed the video game industry for eternity?
---
Wow, I just read it. I don’t care about the stats of an event I want to know what’s happening to the game. What’s the plan for the next few months? Are we literally getting nothing but macro transactions until Wastelanders?
---
They brought "Ring of Fire" over from NW. Not a fan of it, but it's new since patch 11.5. I'm leaning towards public domain music.
---
*laughs in bitter*
---
Difference is DICE had a limited time license through EA, Bethesda owns the Fallout IP. I think they'll stick it out a while, hell they're still updating F4 with new Creation Club stuff they helped with, supposed to be a pretty decent mini-dlc this month, actually. Sure, that's part community built, but they keep it going. I don't think they'll completely abandon one of their two flagship IPs, not without something AMAZING on the other side. Just my take, tho.
---
When autocorrect doesn't work as intended.
---
And there goes all stability that the game currently has now.
---
Great idea but it will kill the game of not done right
---
I like the idea of a class war.   
---
Mainly because I know which team would win.   
---
    
---
*peeps through little golden binoculars*.   
---
   
---
Edit: So I’ve started a Class War.

---
What’s absurd are people charging 15K for a goddamn jumpsuit 
---
To each their own
---
the vice president of Bethesda Softworks stated that the Atomic shop would be limited to cosmetics, and all future content and features would be free. This was published and circulated, and never did Bethesda state otherwise. Well, until they did do otherwise.
---
the ethics line is more for those who I find saying "it's only a video game, who cares", which I've seen quite a bit of
---
How so?  P2W by definition is any situation where you can pay real money to have a significant gameplay advantage over those that don't pay.
---
- Atomic Shop Repair Kits (100% repair) are not P2W since Improved Repair Kits (150% repair) are better and are awarded for free from in-game events.  Also, the Weapon Artisan 3 perk (200% repair) is better than both those options, also free.
---
- Scrap Kits are not P2W and are basically useless with all the workbenches and stash boxes everywhere.
---
- The CAMP Refrigerator is not P2W since it only slows food spoilage by 50%, while the free alternatives of the refrigerated backpack mod (60% slower) and Good with Salt 3 (90% slower) are better.
---
- The Collectron is not P2W since a junk extractor is faster and gives better junk more consistently.  Having slightly more useless garbage like Leather and Cloth isn't going to give you any significant advantages over another player.
---
- Fallout 1st is not P2W.  Infinite junk storage is certainly nice, but 1st subscribers still have to put in the same amount of effort to collect the junk.  The survival tent will save you a tiny handful of caps on fast travel and maybe save you a minute at most for fast traveling to your camp for your Well Tuned/Well Rested buffs.  Stash boxes are everywhere and the scrapbox is only relevant if you're a subscriber.
---
So what part of Fallout 76 is currently pay to win, when the free alternative are all **better** than the paid ones?  Maybe you don't want to argue semantics and just don't like the idea of paid convenience items on principle, and that's fine, but don't call it P2W when it's very clearly not.
---
I mean, I thought of that, but the problem is, I'm not always at my camp. I'm constantly out exploring, gathering items, and doing quests. I don't exactly have time for that. 
---
unless I'm afk doing somethin on my phone, and glance at the screen occasionally, chances are, it won't be used very often
---
As if Bethesda thought any of this through, but maybe, and hear me out, maybe Bethesda has added more life to the game by accidentally creating a class war. 
---
This might bring life to the game, or revive it for some players. I have a couple of friends that have came back to the game after I showed them various articles about what is going on in game.
---
The furious I lost woulda probably be no match for my BE railway but yer right....it hurts
---
Sounds like a slow news day. Gotta keep those hate clicks up.
---
profit does not have to rely on exploitation nor unfair exchange, wtf are you smoking lol
---
Well in comparison, the amount of players playing WoW is around  1.7 million. (And that's really low for them, and that's at a given single point of time.)
---
This is likely around 500,000 and this data gathered over a month.
---
(Meaning players active in Fallout is likely way less then that.) (est: 17,000)
---
Lmao. Nice troll
---
That would go for like 200K caps if it went at all on PC, people would want like 5 godly items are something. It's dumb. PC is dumb.
---
Its not a troll. I'm 100% serious.
---
I know some people are into procedurally-generated game content, but I find they are pretty bland/samey/grindy after more than a few runs...but that's the nature of it not being a truly "designed" experience.
---
That would be more informative than the last 2-3 ITVs.
---
You are comparing this to WoW? The most successful MMO of all time? How did you get your estimate of daily active users? What’s is your math?
---
Really depends on the gun and what you intend on using it for
---
First time enemies spawn they spawn within the lvl range for the area. When a player comes in destroys them, the next time they spawn will be within a lvl range for that players lvl. 
---
Hence why WS is usually around the 60...
---
Agreed on explosive. The splash effect can be useful, but the damage bonus is weak compared to other effects.  +10% aim damage is really undervalued on sniper rifles.
---
Bethesda: "sure"
---
&gt;I hope they introduce some other perks or mutations that do this for other builds in the future.
---
Exactly. I heard someone on the oficial foruns they are trying to revamp berserk build. Also i would like to see maybe a legendary/exclusive faction perk that emulate night/day so nocturnal build gets some love. 
---
Endurance legendary perk : night person
---
⭐ 25% longer nights
---
⭐⭐ 50% longer nights
---
⭐⭐⭐ you never see sunshine again.
---
Dude, chill, I just told you to do simple math.
---
Here, I will help you:  396,709 events total. 5 days x 24 hours = 120 opportunities. That means 3305 simultaneous events. 24 players max on each server = 79,342 players total in game during a peak event. (Thanks to the other user who posted this btw, love ya).
---
And that's the numbers without people repeating the Event, and assuming all servers were full.
---
Not looking good. Outer Worlds, on the other hand, is Top 6 most played game on Xbox so far.
---
The only thing I've noticed was how enemies seem to do more damage again?
---
Taking bets on how many downvotes this gets
---
I find sometimes they are low starting out. But they will increase when I go back.  I think I heard that if you log out then back in it will reset them to your level
---
Welp I mean I'm using it to kill things that most important 😂
---
I would guess: 
---
remember a few patches ago when enemy scaling was modifed to make some of the earlier quests easier for lower levels (e.g. mysteries quest to get blade of bastet)?  
---
Id venture that scaling for lower levels didn't change on private servers - so everything defaults to low level.
---
I've reflected.
---
In that reflection, I was reminded of how much fun I've had since TES: Arena released in 1994, and every subsequent game since.
---
I'm good with still having a shred of goodwill when the totality of time I've played, and enjoyed, their games probably beats out everything else, even with problems.
---
Bullshit clickbait by a nonplayer parrot desperate to keep their "job" in game journalism.
---
It's like 26,000 people at abby given time
---
You’re seriously requesting a refund a year later because you don’t enjoy it?
---
How is it unplayable? Can you not open it?
---
And better still, with a handy red smoke plume that screams "here i am!" - a distinct liability in the wasteland!
---
Anyone is also free to join a player run faction that controls said workshop.
---
There are problems with both ways of doing things, for instance there is absolutely no reason why under your proposed system someone could sabotage the effort with a second account if the faction is hard coded into a game, something harder (but not impossible by any means) to do in player run groups.
---
I am just trying to illustrate that what you are asking for already exists to an extent, the difference is you are asking for a code solution instead of a social one.
---
Yep. On occasion, I'll start a game and everything will be higher level though. Maybe since the worlds are reused, it depends on who was in that world before you. Or possibly, if no one was in that world, it just spawns every mob to be beginner level.
---
I don't mind it so much because I like exploring. If I want to earn xp, I jump on public servers.
---
Nope. Fucking crashes my xbox.
---
Bethesda couldn’t care less at this point they’re just going to hype people up to keep them playing
---
I've sold forest jumpsuits for up to 25k, people just offer that, I don't see why they want them, they're ugly.
---
I bet you're super fun at parties and family gatherings.
---
I have two commado characters, one that specializes in explosive and one with FFR (identical Handmade and 10 mm SMGs except the explosive or FFR).  The FFR is more effective for me except when dealing with a tightly grouped trash mob.
---
I mean are you using it for pvp, mobbing or queen killing?
---
I'll be SURE to do that... to defend a post written off-hand in about 20 seconds, two days ago, that you STILL can't fathom, in intent, tone, or content.
---
It's been real... interesting... keep it up, keyboard warrior! Wield the mighty saber of your immutable and poorly interpreted truth! You are truly doing the lord's work. It's enervating. Truly.
---
That better then what I had but still very bad for Fallout overall. (borrowing this math)
---
You people act like you never spent 60 bucks on a bad game before microtransactions were a thing. For that matter, you act like you never personally enjoyed a game most people didn't like.
---
Yea, they released a trailer in June already showing a lot and you're telling me they keep working on it since then? Something is not right, my bet is we'll never see this update
---
thanks for this tip, ill have to try that next time!
---
Wow, I haven't thought of AO in forever. 👍
---
I know I was just yanking your leg pve exclusive and just overall gameplay ive been seeing these nasty vats build and seems like they outshine the be handmade
---
Talking about over a month though
---
396,000 sentry bots. 120 events (5 days x 24 hours)  3300 instances per hour for one bot death. 24 players per instance = 79k. If there are 3 bots,  its 26k. ((396000/120)×24)/3
---
If you purchased 1 month specifically from the psn store like I did.. I am not 100% so make certain yourself! 
---
But I don’t think we are tied into a recurring payment.. like the people who purchased from BGS store! 
---
I COULD BE WRONG THO, make sure before your moneys gone
---
I do agree with that lol they need to hire better programers for sure
---
Thank u/Silver_State_Slayer !
---
And yeah, it's pretty bad.
---
I made a post about it recently.  Its time to add more variety to the meta game. 80-90% of the people you see are in low health.
---
That's really good to know thank you for the info
---
Which ended up just being Electrically Charged and Unstable Isotope lmao
---
So you used your fallout scavenging tactics in real Life to support your fantasy life in fallout 76 🤪
---
but then why at WS and WesTec they spawn in at level 9?  is the level range for whitesprings and Westec lvl 9??
---
i have a super mutant hound named Lester and a brahmin named Otis to keep me company, but thanks for the offer anyway.
---
Awesome experiment. "The poor give more" is a pretty standard human trait. Having less means we must think externally, and be more aware of where we fit into our environment, and our role with others. Having more means we tend to align our behavior with our internal needs/wants. Contextualism vs. Solipsism. Interesting stuff.
---
If it is out of the hands of the CMs they are not in charge of communication. I still find what they do comment on insulting however when compared to what they ignore.
---
They are obviously given the go ahead to comment on some things even if heavily restricted, I think they can do better even if they are only restricted to commenting on posts about people leaving poo and toilet paper on beds.
---
That’s the magically difference ;)
---
That will be 20,000 atoms a piece, just be prepared...
---
You might be wrong there OP. 400K / 7 days / 24  hours is \~2,380. That's basically a servers up number but maybe they're not just counting the legendary bot. So even at 1/3 that would be \~20,000 people online per hour.
---
adding your math to above
---
let it snow by dean martin would be great for christmas. i mean, one of his songs were in new vegas so, why not?
---
Oh yeah for a handmade ffr all the way
---
And make some improvements on their engine while they are at it... haha
---
That was because Bethesda thought it was a good idea to have shadows tied with CPU. 
---
AC games are pretty cpu heavy because of the 100s of Ai that can be on screen at once.
---
You'd love me. I'd take all that free stuff and drop it all right in front of the machine
---
Bethesda doesn’t care about its fans anymore. Only what’s in your wallet. And I can’t tell you people enough how much that upsets me. Bethesda used to be my favorite game developer. They partially shaped my childhood. Fallout 1st is a blatant slap to the face.
---
Wastelanders will never drop.  I call it thus.
---
Agreed, being able to see our current stats in the pipboy would help too, like seeing what your current armor pen is with all your gear equipped and the weapon you are holding.
---
Yeah, great point.
---
So your honestly thinking by dividing the playerbase, people begin to play together again... Thats some first class nazi stuff lol. Lets build a wall!
---
10,000 berry mentats
---
It's u/Silver_State_Slayer math, you should give him the credit. Thank you, though!
---
I have seen all legendary robots before.
---
either way.. still laughable low.
---
This isn't WoW.
---
That sounds like something is wrong on your end and something you should have resolved a year ago lmao. 
---
Clearly other people are able to play the game.
---
Available now to Fallout 1st™️ subscribers for only 3000 atoms per mutation 
---
^terms ^and ^conditions ^apply
---
So I'm better off tossing the be handmade of to the side ?
---
There is a door with a lock on it, people are looking for a way in. It is an online game.
---
Do you remember the community effort to try to close every single fissure with nukes? People will notice and try the craziest things.
---
You should ask microsoft for a refund while you're at it.
---
Assuming you have both, yes
---
I noticed agility only goes so far. In chameleon armor you can reset into caution by changing spots, something that doesn't happen with unyielding. If bloodied, unyielding with the bonuses to all other stats, kind of nice.
---
Some video shot farming westek and whitesprings, burrows. I run +1 luck on the pieces, with alcohol you can get up to 28 luck. \~350dr/er with blocker makes you a sponge too. I tried weightless, it's more for pvp because it didn't make noise on stop.

---
That’s only the destroyed sentrybots. I saw plenty that failed. How do you account for those?
---
Gotta get that PTO in before the end of the year. I know I do.
---
You figure out the difference between a percent increase and a percent chance yet? Or sre you so out of ammo that you are resulting to childish insults and fallacies?
---
I hear the same stuff from those super mutants too
---
It more than likely isn't the programmers. Programmers want to make things that work. Management on the other hand wants to start making money as soon as possible. So what you end up getting is a rushed half finished game.
---
The whole reason I posted this is cause I just got the bffr just almost 20ish min ago lol
---
Less so. If it was rng for every player then still yes because the server would have to load a new map for every player that was on.
---
Honestly scrap the engine all together. Build a new one that is compatible but more on the lines of of what gta uses... That engine can handle so much chaos without a stutter
---
There is an effect like that already, "kneecapper". It's unused at the moment but it is [included as a tier 4 effect](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/399713408867500032/535475523867115520/unknown.png).
---
No lmao. But what I am saying is, with people actually splitting up into factions, like many of us tried to do at the start, that the game may get more interesting. 
---
I think the subscription gets too much hate from "nazis". I understand both sides of the conflict, but at the same time, why grief players for buying something?
---
Straight up. Behavior modification 101, i.e. "Obedience School." No touch, no talk, no eye contact.
---
Vendors we can't do because everyone has access to them all, but faction based events can absolutely happen right now.
---
It's not about entitlement, it's about a AAA game studio releasing a steaming hunk of shit and hoping nobody noticed when they started asking $100 a year to win. 
---
If anything, Bethesda is the one acting entitled to our goodwill and money. It's our job to show them them that they're not or they'll continue the same practices.
---
Then you ain't to bright. Why are you asking here instead of contacting Bethesda directly? There is literally nothing anyone here can do to help you.
---
Thanks for the tip
---
Is this a bot?
---
Skyrim, Morrowind, Oblivion... all their games follow the same buggy shit, and I'm willing to bet you paid 60 happily for at least one of those, probably more for DLC with it.
---
HOWEVER... that said, being able to save and rollback against bugs was really a major lifeline, there, and I admit without that lifeline, shit's rough.

---
This should help. It’s not a hard and fast rule. But a guide for the spawning Lvl.
---
Then yeah toss the be, id resell or trade it tho coz they can still fetch a good bit of caps/5.56 or good trades
---
Ya think someone would trade a decent set of unyeilding combat for it?
---
Yeah one piece of wood. The shrouded effect works. Ultra light is better than muffled on the other pieces imo.
---
Ok thx I’ll keep this in mind
---
Nah just an asshole
---
IMO that was more information flowdown and not communicating with the community. There were still a ton of issues that we were all having that had nothing to do with what they were introducing that went unanswered on a regular even during that time.
---
I am having the same problem as OP, if it is a problem on our end, what might the problem be so I can fix it? I am playing on PC
---
Definitely maybe not a full set but a few pieces
---
I can't, also can't assume how many sentry bots were repeatedly destroyed by the same person.
---
Either way, it seems way too low
---
Yup
---
While I have my problems with Bethesda lately, this isn’t one of them. Thousands of people play this game on Xbox every day. It’s clearly not that broken. If it’s truly crashing your machine every time you open it, there’s something else going on.
---
I am a conscientious objector, but I wish you luck in your campaign.
---
Wait did they actually try to claim "technical limitations" on this? It's literally BITS. Like it doesnt even need to store the item(which is still bits), just that you have the item-- which is just a number for the item and a number for the durability. literal bits. LITERAL BITS.
---
Ooo boy you made my day thank you so much for your help
---
I play on PS4 with Satellite Internet and this game runs hella smooth for me. I get on average of 580 Kilobytes upload speed. The servers hadn't crashed for me in months.
---
Can you explain why your pimped out pc rig cant handle the game but my PS4 with Satellite internet connection can run it smoothly?
---
No matter the hate, fallout 1st sold well apparently and I see it in every server I'm on. I believe they have come out and said that it's doing so well, wastelanders might come out sooner, and it's funding more dlc type projects. That's what I've heard though, so we will see.
---
Kinda gives me flashbacks to how boring oblivion’s dungeons were. They weren’t procedural but they had one small team do them out of repeating parts.
---
PC Red Dead would like a word on that, lol.
---
They do need to completely rebuild the engine, tho. Or at the very least, as I understand the creation engine is good for modding and user friendly, create a new engine for multiplayer games going forward.
---
Yeah
---
Np
---
No, you're looking at players per day. This is players per hour. At max this would then be like 600K players per day, making it one of the most popular online games right now.
---
80k active users at any given time is not bad for a game like this at all. Sounds pretty healthy to me TBH. Most people aren’t playing 24 hours. I have no idea what the “average play time” is, but if we say 2 hours (which seems like a lot honestly), that means 950k people log on every day.
---
I like sneaking up behind people and doing the mothman emote.
---
In tests found one of each works. One shrouded, one harder to detect, one shadowed.
---
What in the atom shop is not cosmetic and cannot be obtained in game?
---
mischief night was 7 days.
---
Too many so called pvpers and their moms are dressed in duped magic armors and duped op weapons, their ‘pvp’ is simply looking for people without those shenanigans so they can somehow have a sense of victory. It’s essentially the same as those aimbotters in NW that wipe everyone out by shooting at the sky. Because of all this exploiters’ shitshow bethesda had to keep ‘balancing’ weapons and armors and screw up the enjoyment of those who want to have nothing to do with this bs pvp.
---
k, changing
---
woah,  i would expect them to be located in a nuclear missle silo.
---
Wow thx man I appreciate this a lot
---
Fridge and scrap robot. And if you read their recent ITV, they want to add more non cosmetic items into the mix.
---
No slap damage dealt, exclusive private servers, just how are people supposed to be able to have a war with those who can just ignore us?
---
I'll buy a Fallout Second premium subscription if it allows me to invade private worlds, raid the infinite stash, and open PVP. Then you'd have an actual class war.
---
Rdr2 not doing well on PC?
---
Does that really sound bad? 80k people online at any given time? If we assume average playtime is an hour, that means ~950k unique users log on every day. That’s more than I would have thought.
---
I did it a few times until it got grindy. More often than not it many would've moved on to blowing up everything in the courtyard while the eyebot was still 2/3 of the way through the houses
---
If those are unique players. I would assume most are not.
---
It's not 80k users at any given time. It's 80k users at a peak event - assuming *all* the servers were completely full, and that the same player only did one event per hour. It's a maximum number.
---
Other methods have shown around 25k players, judging by how many Sentry bots were killed. So we would be talking a number between 20k and 80k players.
---
Absolutely not
---
Convenience, in my mind, is an advantage, it makes the game easier for those who pay.
---
I am just a humble shopkeep trying to make an honeat living selling ammo and stimpaks to any who wander out of vault 76, while also providing a place of rest and comfort to those who need it. I dont want no part of no hostilities, good sir.
---
\* most popular online games right now 
---
bwahahahahaahaaaa, yeah nice joke
---
I really hope it goes well, i really wanted to buy the redrocket bundle to finish up my city camp but the accidental bungalow set me back a bit an i think i might not be able to get those atoms back in time
---
Well you have to make a lot of assumptions, but at least 80k users at top of the hour. Even if you assume a 25% drop off, that would leave 60k at any given time. That’s still 720k unique users every day.
---
I know your passion is crapping on this game. But numbers seem pretty healthy IMO
---
Heck even with a 50% drop off after the event that is still half a million unique daily users. Not too shabby. It’s not wow, but it’s a healthy player base.
---
Well that’s a wrap. It’s on Reddit now and my camp for the last 9 months is no longer “unique”
---
ps. It’s all about placement. It affects the logo size ; from a large colored blur (which looks like what a glowing light should be) to a sharper focused logo.
---
Capture gallery. Screenshots and videos.
---
That's likely your culprit.
---
https://youtu.be/-nT_j-DjQsU
---
I get scrap and food in the game!  Have you seen how slow that scrapbot is?  It's a complete waste.  After 10 pieces of scrap you don't get more until you empty it.  A complete joke!  Anyways, I only use atoms I have earned in game.  No reason to spend my money when I can get it for free!
---
Selling well, but apparently it has been a rough launch. Frames dropping like crazy, lots of weird physics bugs... the usual plethora of port-bugs. Engine can be pretty solid, but it's also apparently a biiiiiitch to make work on a multitude of different rigs. Which is one of the things the Creation engine they've used for Fallout and Elder Scrolls shined (kinda) in.
---
Aside from Skyrim on PS3. We don't talk about that.
---
You know what? Adding the ability to invade private worlds for pvp would be pretty cool. Kind of like a dark souls invasion.
---
Yeah, the only reason I even noticed it was because where I happened to place the string of lights in relation to the nearby walls made the logo show up about eight feet wide lol.
---
Don't forget Nuclear Winter. I played that half the time mischief night was out. OP is trying to say no one plays this game, but the math says it either has average or above average performance for this period.
---
People seem to complain about it...yet everyone rushes to the survival tent someone placed at V9, after a queen fight to deposit their flux.
---
The only joke is people like you who don't play yet come here trying to stir shit up.
---
I hope this game will overcome the problems today. I loved Bethesda back in the days but players are literally pissed because of Bethesda´s "income politics" - players dont want to be milked like a dairy-cow for that kind of product. People love Fallout but Fallout has changed \*1st\* with *microtransactions* and now we have the **1st** \-thing..
---
It hasn't been in anyway broken 4 me so long no issues at all
---
What's a statement going to do? If they had something to say, they would. If they make a deal with an anti-cheat system, they will. Yes, the rampant cheating is a problem; you don't need Bethesda's permission or validation to confirm this fact. Course-correction takes time; either be patient and be content or don't, and feel good about feeling bad.
---
FFR is always an active perk. Explosive sometimes doesn’t scale.
---
Archer, fitness, and swimming actually. Swimming can do both the revive a player underwater as well as the general revive a player at the same time. Cooking is terrible because you need recipes and ingredients to do it, either of which might be hard to find when you go looking. Archery requires making a crossbow, plans for which are at the range you test on. Fitness requires 5 str and 5 agi. Swimming requires the new camera and having a swimming buddy for the revive, which you'll still need to do for tadpole anyways so do them at the same time as it counts for both.
---
Finding both the recipes and ingredients for cooking will take way more time than the swimming challenge. You just need one swimming buddy.
---
I dunno. It looks like the robots won the event which is sort of hilarious.
---
Way to deflect my guy. Almost didn’t notice you shilling there. Lets get back to the topic you tried to deflect from. Bethesda said “cosmetic only” and that they wouldn’t cross that line. They lied, crossed the line, and plan on going further. That is not and should not be acceptable. That’s like an abusive spouse saying they won’t hit you anymore, then they do so and promise that it won’t be a closed fist next time. 
---
You must be a very casual player to still be getting atoms from challenges. Most of my challenges require 7600 of whatever it is I’m doing to earn 20 Atoms. I’m not playing 7600 hours for $0.20
---
Sounds like the RNG god was looking down on you
---
Lol, I've probably spent 600 dollars into this game not including fallout 1st. I dont regret spending a penny. I love this game. I love 1st. And I like speaking with my wallet when I love something.
---
I'd rather they just balance Energy weapons well to start off with. It makes no sense that they're not on par with or better than ballistics, either their weapon stats or enemy defense stats, need to be appropriately balanced.  
---
Each weapon type should be viable and unless its a gatling laser or someone using it as a low damage option in an event i never see them used.   
---
Lore-wise i would imagine as pistols &lt; Rifles &lt; Machine Guns so it would generally be ballistic &lt; Energy &lt; Plasma &lt; Gauss  
---
With either types or weapon classes having complementary perks that make them fun to use etc etc Just like myself now, i run with a Gauss rifle because i want to, but still have a need for my Fixer or Handmade for certain situations.
---
I don't half wonder like shotguns, that energy weapon beams are just something they don't want rendering en-masse and they're crap just to reduce the likelihood of them borking the game.
---
I've never seen 10 people on a server. Every server is 22-26 on average, so 24, which I think is what everyone was using in the calculation.
---
Don't worry, I'm sure we'll see a Fallout-1st-exclusive CAMP Budget increase item in the Atom store soon enough.
---
Seriously, it's not. I experienced a similar thing with Destiny 2 and just left it for like a year or two, now it's actually pretty solid. I expect a similar thing to happen here. 
---
This is how itll go. They announced fallout 1st, everyone gets mad, everyone forgets, they announce Wastlanders, it rocks, everyone comes back and they get to keep their shitty 1st subscription service
---
Ok, my question to you now is in 1 years time how many problems do you think RDR2 on PC will have?
---
Christmas was why I bought the lights lol, I figure I can alternate strings of red/white and blue/yellow. I've really enjoyed all the different jack-o'-lanterns I was able to place all about my camp, but it's close to time for a seasonal remodel.
---
Fortunately, my remodeling won't lock me out of my house like those poor people at the Whitespring. 👀
---
I completely agree, it doesn't make sense
---
So, nothing about Patch 15? Or the reception that 1st has gotten? No? Alright. Uninstalled.
---
I just worry cause I'm a single shot build (thinking about changing to auto but worried about ammo consumption) will the ffr still apply?
---
ESO explicitly stated that you get the Crowns upon payment.
---
First doesn’t make mention of when you get them except to say monthly.
---
Edit to add: ESO also has some super high ticket items so the lump sum makes more sense.
---
I'm glad to hear you had a good experience playing, made some new friends and it's helped you cope with some issues.  These are the good things rarely touched upon with video games, they can really help when you're in a dark place.
---
Regarding your question, there's always people that just want too see things fail.  Good thing is they are always the minority.  I would say, as a concerned player myself, I do enjoy the game and I want it to succeed.  I had fun with my friends but they've all moved on to other games.  Also speaking as a fallout fan, I want this game to continue  on for years.  But the truth is, that's all up to Bethesda.
---
If you think I simply like to crap on this game for no reason, you haven't understood anything. I defended this game when it got the most heat, at launch, and I purchased the Tricentennial Edition because I really believed it had potential. I was very happy around the time when Wild Appalachia dropped, because it was a step in the right direction for sure. But somewhere along the line, the upper management decided that it was easier to turn the game into a shameless cashgrab instead of improving, fixing, and adding content to the game.
---
Now I'm just waiting to see how they manage to fuck up Wastelanders.
---
I know xd. Usually shoot a little after the vats and it seems to work most of the time, use concentrated fire at 3 too.
---
This is so well done but Bethesda will never EVER do something like this. They're too busy going the cheapo route for their Products.
---
We are, just not necessarily on public servers.
---
Exactly, i am very critical of this game but im not the typical "iTs nOt rEaL fAlLoUt". I was super excited for a multiplayer fallout and i still enjoy this game. But its hard to continue to support bethesda when they just keep spitting on us
---
I carry two rifles on my main with only 4 Strength and have about 80lbs to spare.
---
But how? I carry only what I need. I have less than ten radaway on me, less than 20 stimpaks, and only the ammunition I can use. I constantly drop all the heavy ass missiles and grenade rounds quests seem to always want to drop you.
---
I also run full weightless legendary armor modded with the ultra-light armor mod. Some of my armor pieces weight zero pounds. I don't even need to use the high capacity backpack.
---
I think it's a large group of people who are mad about it, but most of them don't play, never have played, and never had any intention of playing.
---
Exactly ! I was moving lights around and I was amazed at what exactly this was doing. So I never truly understood why but kept them and was proud :)
---
I missed out on the blue / white or even the ones were you can choose the color. Not sure if I can ever get those again but interested to know if they do the same.
---
Tent and unlimited scrap box are the main reason why i have uninstalled the game. These two things give a hudge advantage in a game built around collecting junk and locking them behind a paywall is a dick move. I totally woudn't have a problem with Fallout 1st if it's bonuses were access to private world and a bunch of costumes, emotes and icons only. Hell i wouldn't even have a problem if they put tent and scrap box in the atomic shop like they did with robot and fridge.
---
That's cute, you still think wastelanders is coming out!
---
It seems like you’ve thought about this for a good deal. A simple solution in my mind would be to have the machine do a temp cap hold of no more than 5k caps that disappears after a set amount of time or set the vending machine to hold x amount of caps that must be collected and when the machine in question is full have it shut down while leaving the other on. I doubt they’ll change the system that radically but I feel something should be done for the overflow caps besides evaporating into the void.
---
Indeed. Personally, I keep getting into servers with less than twelve people lately. Yesterday I was alone with three other guys.
---
Maybe, a while back i wanted it but with the camp budget as it is i wouldnt even be avle to place it. Im happy with my town on charleston and i dont wanna delete a house ir something like that for the bungalow that takes quite a bit budget
---
Why waste your time trolling a sub for a game you don’t enjoy. Do you like complaining all day long? Doesn’t it get tiring?
---
Sometimes when people fast travel to your camp they bring company with them...I've had Death Claws , Scorch Beasts , Megasloths appear out the blue just because someone came to check out my vending machines
---
I believe it would be 0.1^24 to have the 10% chance of missing, 3 times in a row across 8 enemies in a row.
---
This equates to 0.0000000000000000000001% chance...I think...
---
They do have a chance to work, though for the longest time I was convinced they didn't. I'd never gotten one to drop in hundreds of hours of Fallout 4, so I firmly believed it was merely a visual novelty to look at. This is probably because up until my most recent main character in 76, luck has ALWAYS been my dump stat in FO games. Always ran with 1, at least at the beginning of a playthrough, and never bothered to get it above 5 or so.
---
I recently made a 15-luck character in 76, and he got a pie on his second ever attempt at one of those things.
---
Out of idle curiosity, I tried again with a brand new character fresh out of the Vault, and after about 5 minutes it became a matter of tenacity rather than curiosity; nearly a damn hour later, a pie finally dropped for him. He had 1 luck. Though about halfway through the ordeal I buffed it to 3 with opossum bacon, because you gotta get buffs for that hardcore pie collecting!
---
Yeah it would, but Bethesda would not do it because they are huge cowards and want to give players their desired solo safe space in exchange for more moo-lah.
---
If the first shot in a continuated series gets "spoiled", each next shot will be. Stop shooting, wait additional second, resume shooting.
---
I think the players hoisting themselves about being “aristocrats” is from a few reddit threads here, they were mostly joking, but I doubt if they said that it’d get as many clicks
---
Wait, don't they have the Walking Arsenal perk in adv. ? That should solve ur issue no?
---
I’m a bloodied stealth commando running an automatic BFFR VATS Cost Handmade. The ammo consumption isn’t that bad. You can easily craft 5.56.
---
That's strange. The only time I see that is like the last couple hours before a server resets because it stops adding players
---
Oh, no doubt, it'll be in waaaaaay better shape by then... hell, probably in a week... but gotta keep in mind they have near-infinite constant funding, thanks to GTA Online, which makes a huge difference in development. If Bethesda was pulling in (somehow) fuckin... what was it, half a billion a year?... from a 6 year old game, none of us would likely be complaining as much. GTA's cash influx is a goddamn juggernaut unlike anything we've seen before, they can burn and throw money around like nobody's business, and literally drown bugs with cash, lol.
---
Ok honestly these conversations with you are a waste of my time so I’m just going to block you now. I hope you find what you’re looking for.
---
Holy shit that's amazingly evil, 10/10 would raid
---
Dismissed.
---
:)
---
Exactly my point.  Many of the initial raider leaders were aristocrats
---
Who knows, maybe I've just been unlucky, man.
---
Unfortunately don't have a bffr vats cost I have 15% vats fill
---
Plan hunting, am currently only missing 6 in the entire game. Heavy Raider Arms, Legs, Shielded Casual Lining, Healing Salve Mire, Pipe Automatic Receiver ( Forrest event drop only ) and Deathclaw extra claw ( bugged, supposed to drop off Deathclaws but doesn’t, have killed probably 1,000s) Anybody have these?? I’m on Xbox
---
You can at least release a few details about wastelanders 
---
It’s pretty obvious the only bit of content left for 2019 is maybe a holiday event.
---
Dude, thats crazy! :) I love your dedication but not everybody is willing to follow that path.. lets see if things change - people are really pissed.
---
I already said it. Add 5% weight reduction to each of the rifleman/commando perks. But only at max rank.
---
As long as there are people who use passive mode they wont be integrating open pvp so .. forever..
---
The most reasonable idea is to do what certain MMO's have been doing for 20 years.
---
PvP servers.
---
Because some people want to play the game without interruption expecting a predictable game experience.
---
Private servers would have easily fixed that problem but they put it behind a paywall "and for an arguably good reason" it costs money to host servers. 
---
I don't think most people Realize how much it costs to keep a game like this running and with new content.
---
Yeah, rockstar has a gold mine 😂 they always will have it to. 
---
Oh no we only made half a billion this year. Guess we will drop gta 6
---
 And by "We" you mean "Me"
---
)) Don't take this too seriously... people who are though of playing as "Aristocrats" certainly do not.
---
OP is talking about player guilds, not NPC factions.
---
You're  joking, but this literally something they said they're looking into for Fallout 1st in their Fallout 1st announcement.   Expanding the CAMP budget size.
---
It’s coming out. Bethesda wouldn’t go and say they are about to release an update they haven’t started on. It may be a very shitty update with reused rewards... but it will certainly come out.
---
A statement would affirm that they acknowledge the problem and are working on it instead of just ignoring the problem all together. The idea that
---
 X is a problem that we don't have a solution for; so our solution is to ignore it altogether
---
Is a very poor idea for a company to take up.
---
lol I don't know, I kinda like when the map is empty and you can farm every spot
---
Many, and the owners are quite often very friendly.
---
Like I'm entering a base, there's a wanted target inside, it's survival mode and I have this funny feeling this must be a trap so I ask "hey is this a trap?" and hear "yes it is" to which I respond "awesome, I'm going in".
---
I made it through the death construction and proceeded to talk with the guy describing methods of killing players via camps. Two other players come near and they ask "is this a trap" to which we respond "yes it is" et voila two more people join us. They didn't make it through xD
---
Just let them enjoy this pal, save it for a different thread
---
I mean I really hope I’m wrong and I hope you’re right in that they do continue with it because I genuinely love the game. I guess I’m just not as optimistic about the future of the game anymore. Again, just my opinion and I totally respect that people disagree with me. But the way things are going with this whole first business, at least in my eyes, they’re either trying to get as much as they can out of the  game for the next year to finish on somewhat of a high note then move on to other projects, or this game is going to a free-to-play model to keep it going long term.
---
Do we at least get to launch snowballs from the mini nuke launcher?  grin...
---
"Thanks for the idea! We will put that into Fo 1st!"
---
Ha! I hope so. That would be clutch - might cost an extra $4.99 though
---
Except bunie/Activision have made good live service games before.
---
Bethesda hasn't
---
So no mention of the horrendous bugs plaguing the event, and no mention of any kind of walk-back for Fallout 1st.  
---
Bethesda is kill, everybody.
---
I suppose that's one way to look at it.  I've played F2P games like Battlefield Heroes and Battlefield Play4Free in the past that got absolutely ruined by stuff like straight upgrades for weapons that you could only buy with real money, or consumables that would instantly heal you for 50 HP mid-fight.  
---
That's about where I draw the line between P2W and what's going on in Fallout 76 right now, I don't think it makes sense to put them in the same category.  It's like comparing apples to oranges.  
---
P2W games will pressure you to buy items that give you a competitive edge over non-paying players.  I've never felt pressured to buy any of the convenience items in Fallout 76; despite having 1800+ hours on the game I've never once even considered buying a scrap kit or repair kit, and the Refrigerator and Collectron are just decorations in my camp.  I don't actually put anything in my fridge, it's a waste of stash space.
---
&gt; apples to oranges
---
But you can still compare them.
---
Very true. I'm definitely not defending Bethesda.
---
D2 at launch had more substantial content than this game does in it's current state and that's saying a lot. This game has an identity crisis and I dont see that changing
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuqGrz-Y_Lc
---
This is a common phenomenon that is indicative of the larger problem of wealth inequality in the U.S.
---
We really need a features thing, why arnt they hyping the damn wastelanders update? Could have at least gotten a damn new trailer with new stuff.
---
Already confirmed at Quakecon. New archer-related perks are coming.
---
I agree. I also only carry what I need, but unfortunately in my case I need to carry over 500 various chems, hundreds of food, 150k ammo and at least a dozen weapons because you can just never be sure what you will encounter out in the wasteland.
---
Oh, don't get me wrong, I don't flatly disagree with you or anything, shit could absolutely go either way, but I just still have a wee bit of optimism.
---
It is a common issue with PS4 that really only starts to show up when you are starting to get a full hard drive. the PS4 basically requires the game to copy it self so it needs double the space to install the update. 
---
Clear up space and/or invest in an external hard drive to put games you are not playing very often on.
---
I like running with a variety of weapons, just like many others do. Sometimes I use my AAE hunting rifle, sometimes I like to snipe stuff with my AA handmade. Sometimes I just wanna have fun with different rifles. From my Exec Expl Railway to my AAE and Insta lever actions. Hell, scorchbeast?  I'll use my AA Gauss rifle.
---
I shouldn't be forced to just run what I  "need"
---
Yep. Played since beta, loved this game, still think it has so much potential so I stick around the sub and read itvs etc. 
---
1st isn’t the direction I want Fallout to go, that’s not the hole I want this game to go down, so I uninstalled- refusing to support the new direction, will reinstall for wastelanders or if they make a change, but with the attitudes of the community, I doubt there will be much change.
---
Games do not need players to make money anymore. Runescape 3 used to be one of my favorite games, until aggressive MTX just got worse and worse and the community just kept going “lol just don’t buy it” “how is it winning?” 
---
You can literally buy yourself max level there now, and the craziest part is the player count has been dropping like a STONE and they still make record profits each year because of whales, **Their most profitable year was the year with the lowest average player count**
---
It’s sad, and the thing is I can totally see 76 moving down this route if the profits hold up. It’s not like it’s a main fallout game, I can see their logic here, milk the offshoot to fund the main games.
---
Imprezo must be as bored as I am. Between survival being gone, NW full of hackers, and workshop owners hiding on private servers, there is nothing to do. I quite literally logon, look for a workshop, toggle on hunter/hunted, sell 3 serums to cap vendors, and logoff in five minutes. I try again on my lower level PVP character and do the same thing. 10 minutes spent, nothing to do.
---
I would love if they brought survival back as a season-based mode that wipes your character every month. They would need to give us a sixth character slot though. Nobody would buy any duped gear because it would be gone in a month, the hackers would stick to NW, and the most cunning and knowledgeable players would thrive; not just he with the most broken legendary gear.
---
Fallout 1st:   
---
Private servers you can have to yourself... oh but their recycled public servers, so everything is already farmed.  
---
\- You can play by yourself.... Oh but any of your friends can join you at their own will.   
---
\- You can own the various workshops... Oh but once you leave the game, all of your work will be deleted.   
---
\- all of this, for 15.00$ a month! Its a great deal you won't find in any other games!  
---
\- A community dev team who says they care about your feedback, but their game has been and continues to be broken and still in beta.   
---
Conan Exiles, ARK: Survival Evolved, and others  
---
\- Private servers that are freshly created  
---
\- Invite only, people can only join if you allow them, or if they know the password  
---
\- Servers are continuous, as long as you pay the monthly fee, the server continues to run, even if your not online.   
---
\- Very Little next to no bugs, and a community dev team who actually gives a shit about you, and your feedback.  
---
I am and have been a avid fan of the Fallout series, and still actively play F3, F4, and NV. What gets me, is players have the ability to add seamless multiplayer to games like F3 and Skyrim, but Bethesda can barely release a halfbaked video game, and attempt to call it a real game, when its player base can release bigger and better, and the modders who make it, oftentimes go unpaid.
---
Not difficult to add generated dungeons, just need to have prebuilt pieces randomly piece together and make sure there is a possible path with said pieces which really common in games but one issue and its Bethesda. Bethesda so bad at the current dungeon system they can only have one "instanced" dungeon per server so its not likely unless its battle royale feature they plan to make. To be blunt instanced dungeons with randomly generated generated for a very long time and oldest multiple game I know that has real instanced dungeons is Mabinogi where you would go into your own dungeon and its a game around 15-20 years old.
---
On Wastelanders, it's probably because dangling a thing they just delayed wouldn't be helpful. I bet we get one next month, and if they're super smart, they'll drop in some super minor content sprinkles leading up to it like they did with Nuclear Winter.
---
It’s a discussion thread lmao, are we supposed to all stay quiet and just vote? Gtfo lol I’m at work while responding to this shit. It’s almost as if people can have lives and do more than one thing at a time! Shocking, I know.
---
I’ve never been. I’m level 158 or 9... I forget.  I’m on Arizona time but would be happy to join you in figuring it all out soon. Also on PC
---
Plot Twist:  Maybe some of those high level players were taking everything so they could put it up for free in their camps.  ;p
---
Here's to escapism. 
---
You're a wholesome person. Keep doing that 💜
---
Inside the vault has ALWAYS been a crappy little blog post thrown together by some poor low level in Beth's PR department with the barest of information fed to them by the dev team.
---
And every time one of them has come out people rage at them for not providing enough info as if they're supposed to be detailed patch notes.
---
So totally cool.  I had my brother’s chemistry set back in the 60’s.  So much fun.  Gone forever....
---
Why do I get the feeling Wastelanders will be massively cut down in content because it’s a strain on the engine/server. Also what’s this random header for Invasion from the Stars, with an Atomic Shop suit and wallpaper.. why does that seem so random and out of the blue and... pointless in relation to anything.
---
Isn’t this on the Bethesda please list?
---
It's NW only. I think it'd be kinda broken in Adventure mode.
---
They've started dropping minor changes. Like Vault 79
---
Brought to you behind the wonderful paywall called fallout first.  The first fallout bow exclusive to the aristocrat class who shells out money to Bethesda.  Enjoy it and pay for it loyal customer
---
I'd love adventure, nuclear adventure (NW mathemathics but adventure mode), nuclear winter (as it is) and nuclear hell (adventure mathemathics, your adventure gear, mutations and shit, no ammo, aid, junk - this you loot). I believe this would be the simplest to implement given what's already here.
---
To be fair someone tried to kill me cuz of my ranger outfit, destroyed my generators and stole my junk when I died. It ain't as bad as they're making it seem but some folks are certainly taking they're anger out on the wrong people.
---
I agree with you. I’m a fallout 1st member. I have zero issue with a paid subscription service.
---
What concerns me is their lack of a timeline &amp; updates that’s inevitable slowly killing the game. That’s it....
---
That's so awesome! I'm glad you guys are able to bond over the game and enjoy it! I met someone in the game I helped when they were new out of the vault who has a similar story with his daughter :) I love how video games bring people together and I love this community.
---
7 days changes the totals to about 2600 kills per hour /  56k players per hour
---
That is objectively untrue. Go back and look at the first like... 12 issues of it, it was pretty full of information and near-future roadmapping of stuff. It's the last few that have REALLY fallen short.
---
Lol. If you'd swap out your carry reduction weight perks in exchange for damage, you would kill so quickly you wouldn't need to heal 10 times per cave cricket or spend 200 ammo per scorchbeast.
---
I am totally picking up on your sarcasm, btw.
---
I didn't even say to stop, just be respectful of them, know the right time and place
---
You first.
---
True, but I mean stuff that's like... evidence of people moving towards Appalachia.
---
My wife likes to play nw in the morning and i play adventure in the evenings. RIP my atom income for the last couple months. 
---
Worst part is that they've basically said fuck cosmetics, atom shop is going full on utility/advantage in the future so I'm hoarding atoms for things that will make the game playable in the future. But honestly the good stuff (i.e. scrap stash box) will be cash only anyways, so it probably doesnt matter much.
---
They're trying to create an artificial "funsies" community vibe, by letting those still playing that they are not alone. 
---
"Don't think the population of this game has gone down the toilet! See these counts of thousands of opponents killed? There's proof! But don't sit down and do actual math between opponents killed, factored by total number of hours for the event, factored by total possible player population across nation-states! That would look very, very bad!"
---
"In conclusion, buy more stuff! There are no problems to discuss!"
---
I appreciate you do still do! Heck I still enjoy coming to the sub and seeing positive positive posts about the game as I’m still a huge fallout fan. Makes me want to reinstall it and jump back in sometimes. I guess it just comes down to I’m just not a big fan of the direction it’s heading. 76 is great and has huge potential just didn’t expect this.
---
What is the cheating in Nuclear Winter??
---
You know what, you’re right. I apologize. Just deleted those comments. I was very rude.
---
&gt; will reinstall for wastelanders or if they make a change
---
thats my plan also. i hope things will change - i dont want Fallout to go down like that..
---
I plan on keeping it until Cyberpunk 2077 drops
---
While the rest of the game is plagued with bugs, crashes, lag and exploits. Awesome!
---
There have been. Dead Caravans, settlers that got attacked recently. There's been some smaller changes around the map.
---
The bags, the nukacola bottles, the cheaters in nw, the broken promise for no pay to win, the fallout masks that are a health hazard and had to be recalled, fallout first being more than the cost of xbox live.... but yeah, you hold out that this game will be awesome with their garbage ass track record.
---
For real. I bailed when survival was removed. I started playing The Division 2. I only come back to enjoy the chaos as Bethesda destroys their own franchises.
---
Gods I loved FO76 for 1000+ hours.
---
That is the best.
---
You're confusing "loading time" with finding a lobby right?  If it's taking you ten minutes to LOAD then there's something seriously wrong on your side of the game, if it's taking you ten minutes to find a lobby on the other hand it's just that not many people are playing and the game is trying to find enough to start forming a group.  If they added multiple game modes of NW it would just make your problem worse because then they would be splitting people up between those modes and making it even harder to find enough to fill a lobby quickly.
---
"Axedental Homicide"
---
I would love this! Also a simple yes or no emote without the thumb up/down so you don't come across sarcastic when you don't want to
---
I *think* what they'll do is spin off a new server/game mode, kinda like survival or NW, for Wastelanders. Otherwise, the base game story would be lost, and that wouldn't be good for new players or people grinding old content, since it'll be a major shift in story. That'll make the servers likely more stable.
---
And I read somewhere a theory that the Atom Shop sucks right now because they were gearing for Wastelanders, and without it, they probably had to delay a lot of Shop stuff, leaving us with... trash.
---
There definitely needs to be though
---
I don't see a point now. I mean with the Stashbox I have a ton of left over storage now, I can collect pretty much what ever I want now. And just going by how many Stashboxes I see in the wild they've done rather well with First subscriptions. So while you may balk at how it was solved, the issue is rather moot now.
---
Haha. You know the worst part I regularly have super duper equipped instead of bloody mess. That is straight up a crafting only perk and not even a QOL perk. The few times I crafted ammo without it I got so annoyed that I just leave it on. That's right I use up more ammo in 90% of fights just so I don't accidentally craft less ammo the once a day I actually do that. Mine is a sad FO76 existence.
---
cool, won't get me back after Fallout 1st though
---
How about a statistic of how many times the servers crashed?
---
They need to add opera glasses to the Atom shop.
---
That’s so sweet 🥰
---
I’ve gotten 4 pieces of pie in 700 hours of play. They work. I try every time I see one. High luck matters!
---
Hey everyone look who finally joined the party
---
Dead caravans have been around since launch. On occasion, even spawned as a Deathclaw merchant. Thats just random event stuff since the beginning. No idea what you mean by settlers that got attacked recently, tho.
---
I don’t know if I’ve ever seen every single Ghoul be a Legendary in The Whitespring Golf Club. Now that sounds LEGENDARY. 
---
It must have been a lot longer than a few months being that Explosive Gauss Rifles haven’t been a part of the loot table for Legendaries for around 8-9 months. It’s a Legacy weapon.
---
Others say it is cosmetic only and does not protect.  Can you verify?
---
The [last roadmap](https://i.gyazo.com/c6e17d4849fd132c67b007b45ed5f728.jpg) ended in September. We got a pretty cool challenge with Project Clean Appalachia, adding a Meat Week and Purveyor sale that ended not long before the Mischief Night, so I am hoping we'll either get a Roadmap for the rest of 2019-early 2020 or a *Project Clean Appalachia-like* event with purveyor sale and Fasnacht Parade [hinted to return here](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/wRbFs3isUcOl1cZlp3ulb/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-public-events-preview) for mid Nov to early Dec before a Christmas event. I'm not placing any bets on the former, but the latter seems doable
---
Hey bud..there are a fuck ton of people who are insane then.  I do the same shit everyday in this game.  A ton of other people do too. And ive done the same shit everyday for over a year now. And when i get off work and get home..ill fuckin do it again.  Its a fuckin awesome game. And plus..now i have more stash room to keep doing the same thing AND i can do it by myself in my own insane server. Your a big dumb blubber boulder nahm sayin?
---
No worries man, you did the right thing, thank you
---
Time is still kept though after that date by everyone who remained and everyone who came afterward.
---
You are correct, finding a lobby is the problem. I just thought that might make more people play
---
You can't release a new roadmap every week.  
---
And even if they provided information on upcoming stuff AGAIN this is not a post from the dev team but from PR using second hand information handed down to them.  If the PR team ends up communicating something wrong or something changes between their post and the actual release, both of which have happened before, it always leads to a shit storm from the players for being "lied to" again.
---
I support the game with my $ and time.  So long as there is enough of us, the game will continue.
---
"Happy Birthday to You" is in public domain, at least in the US
---
[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/happy-birthday-song-officially-recognized-in-public-domain/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/happy-birthday-song-officially-recognized-in-public-domain/)
---
Aimbots, player location hacks that display a HUD showing where other players are, shooting through walls for perfect headshots, stuff like that. YouTube has a bunch of videos of it, if you give it a search.
---
Let's see, if I had an extra point say every 10 levels I would have 38 extra special points over a level 50.  Sounds fair to me, not like I would have an unkillable one shooting monster of a toon or anything XD
---
I want the colonial wigs!
---
I would only if it's something hard to get mods for. Things like radium rifles, ultracite gatling laser, or some of those event things like the bear arm. However I dont think it's ever expected, and I dont think itll change the value. Just kinda like a nice thing to do
---
There's been new random encounter spawns that I've seen with a note of certain places they've been heading.
---
Happy cake day!
---
 Oh awesome, thanks for sharing man, I've been looking for the old menu background for a long while now. :D
---
If your child is worth less than $100 a year you have bigger issues than a video game.  Get some perspective bud.
---
I mean... nobody is asking for a weekly roadmap. Well, nobody reasonable is, at least. And, again, they did it for months, delays included, without issue. When they were more communicative, people were more forgiving because at least they knew something was being worked on. The whole way they did it before, during, and after Wild Appalachia was when it was best.
---
\*Fallout Shovelin Shits\*?
---
for a total reduction of 15%?
---
Oh man is that a bad fix. Bear arms at rank ONE gives a 30% weight reduction...
---
I've already left
---
Sad to say but there's just nothing keeping me going anymore.
---
I can't even make better contraptions because of the lack of building plans and camp budget
---
 Mean its just a bigger discounted atom points bundle with extra rewards, get your head out your butt for a minute and break everything down, it what I MYSELF did before buying a month sub for first to see how it is, ill say its worth it for the atom points and private session alone just saying
---
You have infinite scrap storage. You just need to pay $13 a month.
---
This. Lol
---
Hey thanks for taking the time to read and respond And i agree with a lot of what you said, I just feel like my stash as it is some what limits the random weird legendaries and stuff that I get to keep, and I can usually make space in my stash when I need it but it’s just annoying to know that for $13 a month I wouldn’t really have that issue. That’s just my take though.
---
You sure that's not just more of the same? There are lots of notes and a few random encounters about caravans moving through the Divide, ambushed by raiders and stuff, since the beginning. Not trying to cast doubt or anything, but I play a LOT and haven't seen anything that couldn't have been from before the Scorched became a thing.
---
Same issue here I have a 500 gb when it's more like 400 I always have to delete more
---
Then post to Bethesda not to Reddit!!!
---
My understanding is that the increase was for private servers
---
add me on psn: Owl_No
---
ah! i see WS is lvl 12 minimum for spawns, thank you!
---
Xbox One. Both on an X and and S model.
---
You speak for a minority of the community. These umbrella posts of "lol community pissed" are getting old. 
---
Just because YOU'RE angry doesn't mean the majority of people are. To be quite frank, the majority of new people I meet in game are beyond happy with how things are progressing. Myself included.
---
Yeah, this seems to be an automatic fire type bug. It popped up after they removed multiple critical hit chaining. It now takes half a second or so to register changes in vats accuracy during full automatic fire. You can use this to your advantage with critical hits to retain full accuracy for the following 2 or 3 bullets.
---
I usually tap the trigger to ramp concentrated fire accuracy up before I go fully automatic.
---
I've also been playing a lot since the beginning. There are new details coming out (through data mining of course) . Also Dutchess and Butch are coming back. Meg (Idk who the heck she is) a raider leader is also coming.
---
Yeah... easy as that right lol. I’m in college and don’t have any money for stash size... were is the student discount at? -_-
---
I deleted it the first time cause I got pissed they nerfed the hell out of TSE I’ve been playing since better to but my system is slow so it deletes 76 when I don’t want to delete it
---
They should implement this Hunter Hunted as something more than a radio that nobody ever picks up.
---
A physical event location and public event status would make it more frequented and so much better...
---
Well it was on my external hard drive but it broke like a month ago so now I’m downloading it again
---
the problem is the complexity of wastelanders is a huge rework of the core game since it was never really designed for dialogue boxes and such since the players were supposed to be the vendors / quest givers / and role players so they basically had to do a massive over haul to fix it
---
It's $13. Skip one single pizza or 6 pack.
---
Make another character and store extras there
---
Oh ok I didn’t know if it was all platforms there were issues
---
Shoot I honestly didn’t think of that... now I feel kinda stupid hahaha
---
I would say not.  There is no point.
---
Right. It’s a huge overhaul to the core game. 
---
I have a feeling they will bring out public test servers first &amp; then push wastlanders out to public test servers maybe to Fallout 1st members to start (not being negative just something I can see them doing I’m a 1st member)
---
**Two shot** is really gimped now. It's 2 shots, but each does 75% damage, so in reality it's only 150% damage, and keep in mind that since each shot  does 75% damage, it gets hit harder with DR, meaning that on high armor targets, you may not see much of a dps increase. Combine that with the awful accuracy, breaking your gun twice as fast, and it's very underwhelming.
---
**Anti Armor** is OK. It's less effective than you think because ideally you're already running an armor reduction perk card, so that 50% isn't really 50%. Doing more damage via Junkies or Furious, or even better, bloodied, is usually a better option. I'd still take AA over TS though.
---
**Junkies** and **Furious** are better options and both are about even in effectiveness. Neither has any serious drawbacks (addictions are very manageable, Furious takes a few shots to get to full damage output), and provide reasonable damage boost.
---
**Bloodied** is the king for damage output. Combined with **Adrenal Reaction**, **Nerd Rage**, **adrenaline**, **psychotats,** **bobblehead**, and **ballistic bock**, and you have a ridiculuos amount of damage. Add **Revenant** for even stupider damage.
---
**Vampires** is a neat choice for very high fire rate weapons and can do very well in pvp, assuming you make your shots. If you ~~suck at the game~~ can't manage a bloodied build, consider running Vampires. You'll do 1/5th the damage but you won't ever die.
---
For the second effect, **explosive** is very underwhelming. Demo expert is never worth taking now. It adds 12% damage for 5 perk points. The only enemies where it will matter are highly resistant to explosive damage anyway. Stick to **25% FFR**, **50% VATS Crit** (for vats builds like stealth commando), or even **10% damage while aiming**, though keep in mind 10% while aiming doesnt count while in VATS.
---
The 3rd effect is basically **15% faster reload,** **90% weight reduction** (heavy weapons benefit most), or **25% VATS cost reduction** (combined with 50% VATS Crit for a stelath commando build).
---
That sucks, and yeah wait for Wastelanders. Hopefully the delay will lead to a good release.
---
Yes let’s keep dividing the community with bullshit like this.
---
I for the life of me cannot figure out why this wasn't in the game from the beginning. This works well in fallout shelter, and would make them money...
---
I just don't get it
---
Look I used to a big mod maker for Fallout.... Why do get to judge me? You don’t even know me man.
---
Accurate 😂 these should be a thing
---
Bro, as tired as i am with people complaining....this was legit and i loved it.
---
Yep they gotta be more transparent
---
As it doesn’t “stack” the next event has no concept of the previous event therefore its the same each time. The odds don’t change for each bullet. (Bugs and glitches aside)...
---
Same principle as flipping a coin, its 50/50 for every flip.
---
And make mutant players take extra damage from mutant slayers gear while we are at it please.
---
These mutant freaks need to look the part and mutations as a whole need more counter to their benefit.
---
If that money doesn’t show, then you owe me owe me owe
---
 ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯   
---
I didn't think of that. We probably need it configurable via a terminal. One of the options would be to only have the robot "on duty" when the camp is not actively being attacked. If your turrets take out the threat, he could get back to work. However another option would be to keep fixing while under attack, with a priority to defenses (keep fixing turrets).
---
So much irony, they choose to go dark the same time this shit was a dumpster fire last year
---
My history... in which I've primarily defended the game, even in this thread where I've stated repeatedly I know they can do better and I enjoy the game? Or perhaps the post where I simply asked if enclave masks were purposefully removed from MODUS? Or maybe the one where I said the game wasn't pay to win? Suuuper negative.
---
And, as I've said before, look at the amount of info in the first like dozen blog posts vs now.
---
Someone probably just completed rose’s quest and doesn’t need it anymore.
---
Lol, got removed for a short title. I love the edit
---
Yeah. As wastlanders is basically a “reboot” of 76, I can see them being secretive about it.
---
I think it’s going to have more bug fixes/adjustments/balance changes including weapons &amp; armor than most are expecting besides the new content of course.
---
Will be interesting to see what they pull off with it
---
No, thus why I'm asking.
---
Pro tip. Use voice chat only on ENGLISH...
---
Maybe have a cooldown and a notification “your camp is under attack!” Make it a mini quest that everyone cas se and reward a couple food or stims.
---
Tbh i just want another robot to walk round my camp
---
More attention on this: if were paying to test, im out
---
So, if players were killed several times by the robots over the week, what does that say about the number of people still playing? I admit it, I died a fair few times, and still went back for more!
---
And that is why i still play too. I made loads of gull armour sets for ppl during the last event... Why not share the wealth!!!
---
And I used to love running track. You dont see me going to a track and telling the runners that their time is laughable huh?
---
This is what we really need.
---
I mean i still like the game. Sure i cant play it as often as i would before since its gotten a bit repetitive but all in all i enjoy it. Spent the last few days getting most of the NW rewards, fuck that 14k xp, and its one of my most enjoyed game modes ever
---
I'd like to see it just hide in it's pod until the threats are taken care of. Or maybe have it go into battle mode.
---
battlefield V?
---
I've encountered this before. Restarted my computer
---
I was just thinking that.
---
This needs to become a regular series of posts. Far better than anything officially released lately.
---
Yeah its a pian not having it. I actually hunt down bloodied reduced weight weapons just so i can have all what i want while using all ammo reduction perks.
---
I did all of the ones in lower Savage Divide and the one in Ash Heap. Had to be in the center for most of them
---
Wish I could bump you twice
---
Not really. Other than I don't know what they consider "the lake by Grafton"
---
Weird. I tried that. Doesn’t seem to work. 
---
But I’ll try some more. 
---
This post, "Wow this sucks now", complaint of Dupe Removal and not even tallying all the comments in this thread. 
---
I get the dupe removal bit but if a problem is to be fixed and you have a source of that problem, then everyone has to tighten their belts and suck it up.
---
You're asking me to believe that they put things in the game with the intention of frustrating and inconveniencing their customers?
---
If they lock legendary perk system/players behind fallout 1st I will bow my head and leave. I haven't left yet, I do agree with some of the backlash but I just kinda saw this coming from the start. Suprised it wasn't there at launch like ESO did honestly. I mean, I know they are adding new content to it and all. I just am hoping it doesn't go that far in that direction. I've been trying to stay somewhat loyal. But we will see when it all comes out. .
---
Haha. I knew you'd pick that out. See when someone has no other argument they have to try and attack someone's intellect. I'm glad you can still kinda function with all that booze in your system. But yes, you are.
---
Yes. That is how you sell "convenience items".
---
How about you guys address some actual issues
---
15 people would hide in the shed while a small group fought the queen. Not really a bug fix but I member’.
---
SBQ performance has fluctuated, and I still get pretty laggy sessions sometimes. But the first time I fought SBQ? Fantastic gaming moment!
---
Most mobs either focus somebody else or die before they get close. It's still great.
---
If you want to tame one i recomend going to the cranberry glade and server hop there
---
Not disagreeing with your general sentiment but for those that use AAA as a standard, AAA is only about funding not quality, no surprise there. 
---
Bethesda's current engine and it's variations have literally never released a "solid" game if we look at bugs. Bugs in general are hard to iron out for a game this big (map, item count, player count, event, etc) no matter the level of funding. The testing teams are generally small and have deadlines of course, it's easier in massive games like this to release the game when "everybody" is happy (ie big wigs and investors). They have always had game breaking bugs that aren't solved until their games are at least a year old, usually in their GOTY editions or massive patches. These come from bugs they never encounter in small sample size but become prevalent when a million people are now playing your product experience a plethora of bugs. 
---
The problem with this isn't the funding, AAA or indie, it's the fact that they used what's called a Minimum Viable Product strategy, MMO or  similar type games are generally released to this standard regardless of funding. Where they fucked up was not being literal it seems, this was *LESS* than *minimum*. Perhaps they should have tested that new engine they've been working on if they were gonna release the game in this manner anyway. 
---
It's my hope as a fan of TES and FO that a significant chunk of revenue from 1st and the Atom shop will go toward releasing a better, more refined Wastelanders and the shame and loss they've faced at Beth and Zeni will make the new engine, TES6 and FO5 a little bit better. I dont care about the companies just their IPs lol.
---
Well, here's hoping.
---
That's sounds like a legit reason. Thanks
---
The problem is, they are not "roleplaying" it, this is not a joke to them it is harmful to the community and anyone caught in its crossfire that wants NO PART of this.
---
They are not innocently trying to have fun and "own" whatever this nonsense you are talking about is.
---
this is creating the wrong mindset in the game and takes all the fun out of it.
---
They truly believe they are better than the other players, and openly fault that in-game to the point of harassment and griefing, a clear violating of the ToS.
---
and yet nothing is done about them because they are paying players. 
---
a true divide that needs to be addressed
---
I'm thinking it's just the same old asshole interactions, but this time some of us are and aren't First Members. I don't go around flipping off BMW drivers (well I do, but thats because all of them are assholes) because I don't have one.
---
That still happens! Haven't seen 15 for a while but still get a handful of low levels cowering under cover from time to time.
---
Thanks I’ll start writing them until they actually hire me I think
---
And yet it is what it is. You can stop playing, join in, or continue with out. But nothing will change and if you enjoy 76 you just move on. Nothing in life is free for long after all.
---
&gt;  I uninstalled- refusing to support the new direction, will reinstall for wastelanders or if they make a change,
---
But herein lies a big part of the problem.  Many of the game's most vocal critics don't play it.   Fallout first's harshest critics form roughly two groups. 
---
Group 1. 
---
The first group says OMG! Behesda are scum!  This service is ridiculous! (By the way I don't even play the game). 
---
Group 2
---
Group 2 still plays the game.  Their school of thought is OMG this Fallout 1st thing is horrible.   Now take my hundred bucks and give me my scrap box for the year. 
---
There's no reason to respond to people who aren't playing the game.  There's no reason to modify their behavior if the people playing the game let them get away with it (and they are letting them get away with it).
---
I question the strategy - just get out in front of it with a semi-mea-culpa that also shuts down.
---
Why not put together low-hanging-fruit goodwill campaign and give an easy promise to get in x reasonable amount of QOL fixes before end of year.
---
Can't help but feel that - without making fixes or new features - just setting up a constant schedule of easy paints-as-plans to the end of the year and perhaps committing to releasing some free oft-requested things might be a big feather in their cap.
---
Adding a two-four new public domain songs would probably be worth the effort.
---
They said a while ago that fasnacht would come back - well bring it back
---
If New Years doesn't bring firework flare gun mods - thats miss.
---
Anyways I can't claim to know what they do so I just hope they can fix things with everyone that matters and we can all move on to whats next and coming in the late winter.
---
My apologies. I read your comment with the standard "everyone has a smartass answer on reddit" filter. Sometimes I forget what sub I'm in. If it makes you feel better, I'm pretty sure you killed me in nw today lol (if not you than a very similar psn)
---
Heh, they can utterly fuck it up in a couple months (Wastlanders is going to be an utter clusterfuck when it drops, things are going to crash in NPC instances, characters are going to get deleted again, all that crap) and a big pile of people are fucked, they've paid $100 for premium access.
---
That’s not the case
---
Check out the ApocalypseAristocrats subreddit or their Facebook.  Very casual and fun people
---
And which of the items I listed has been a cruel ploy to sell you a convenience item?
---
You can look at it both ways I guess. Heard most racial slurs when burning someone up in the trap. The worst are the zoomers with the homophobic stuff. But besides the point, I'm not sure looting the stash boxes would go down very well. I'm all for it- really I'd love to see this game get hardcore, but most of the players who support the game probably like it casual.
---
I used to really be into hardcore mmo. I still remember N this you N in lineage when I confused a boss onto a casual. That game you can drop gear. So when he lost a blue wolf chest piece which was like $100 real money adena, you heard the most racist stuff. My clan leader at the time was such a nice guy, he gave the guy another to stop the guys alliance from rotoass hunting. I don't work well in clans, never have. My clan leader only put up with me because I was a good 1v1 player in his quake 2 clan at the time.
---
Besides a lot of gamers are gay. I don't know about consoles but on PC, around like 50%.
---
It's all bullshit. Bethesda probably paid them off to make this marriage in the wasteland story. Its fucking 2020. Marriage dont mean a goddamn thing nowadays. Would've been more believable if they were swingers who fell in love with eachother, for maybe 3 months. Cause hey, if people are Oogle and awe-ing about bethesda and how they are a better dating platform then plenty of fish, then maybe people wont be so angry about the actual state of the game? Hmmmmmmm
---
Let's be real, the servers will never really be that stable regardless.  Rounding out stashes to 1000 lbs for everyone would go a long way for the community.  I also don't really see any reason they should ever be bigger than that.
---
Yeeah I member
---
Can't they though? It won't bring them more immediate income unless more people buy the game, but with their current image it won't be nearly as successful compared to being offered before 1st came out.
---
4 rifles ,200k ammo , 200 stims , 200 dogfood , 200 water 50 dil radaway...1-3 shotting most enemies. Works like a charm . 255 weight with 60 to spare
---
Remember as it was yesterday. Good summary of release-state. Like to add the destruction of mods while building your camp.
---
Yeah it just kinda comes off as a deflection from the real issues with this game so often expressed on this sub. It’s like they are praying people will only see the positive stuff that is said.
---
I remember when Watoga would spawn legendary protectrons.  Those were the days...
---
I think they maybe talking about life in general.
---
Damn i hate you for it..but touche. Heres your upvote
---
Honest to god if people are whining about this game and have been here from the start they’ve gotten a year of play out of 100 bucks or so (NZD, dunno how much in USD) and that’s a really good ROI.
---
&gt;I shouldn't be forced to just run what I "need
---
Why not? 
---
Most of my non-STR characters have to run just what they “need”
---
Thats no proof that Fallout worst sold well. It could also just be that many, many players were so offended they just left. 
---
Faster update and more content? I believe they are just experimenting how far they can monetize this dumpster fire before they move on. Bethesdas behavior, especially in the last 2 weeks, tells me that they don't give a fuck anymore about anything else than money.
---
"wE wIlL iMprOvE cOmMuniCatIon gOiNG fOrWaRd"
---
Sure, but a longer beta and / or test servers would have crushed majority of these issues quickly.  There's no logical reason for why they don't have test servers, at least for pc, right now.
---
Oh I see. 
---
Well that will remain a mystery then lol.
---
Everyone liked that 👍
---
Not now that there’s a solution you have to pay for.
---
400? Wasn't the stash limit 200 at launch? I remember I was struggling with it before I'd even hit level 5.
---
OK Boomer.
---
This is actually why I bought Fallout 1st. If it wasn't for the private servers I would have switched to Xbox or PS4. It's also why I won't PVP...AT ALL! Cheating in PVP is the worst. If you seriously need hacks to PVP then you've automatically told the world that you suck at PVP. I've actually seen people use hacks against hackers to try and make them quit the game but honestly that just makes the problem worse. Server stability is already terrible and hackers make it worse for the rest of us. Personally I've enjoyed the game a whole lot more with the private servers because I don't have to put up with that bullshit but I shouldn't have to do that. Bethesda you to do something about cheaters and hackers. I shouldn't have to buy Fallout 1st just to enjoy the game. I already paid for it so why am I paying for it again?
---
We destroyed about 300k Sentry bots, of which roughly 1/3 were the boss.
---
They killed almost 1 million players in total.
---
It's safe to say that if this all happened in a single night, we'd have gotten our ass handed over to us.
---
dam. he didnt made the effort to go to you? if not then he wasent worth it.
---
P. Good lol.
---
The Grafton lake goes from the dam actoss to the Scout Camp. Take the photo from the hut closest to the wooden pier, or on the pier, looking across to the dam.
---
No this was 15 years ago, I'm old. Lol.
---
Dude, if they pipe up and say "yeah, games fucked. We know a load of stuff needs sorting but management want half the devs on utility items and shiny stuff to pull in some more FU1st payers, don't worry though, we've still got 2 guys on Wastelanders", they can't pay their mortgage next month.
---
The objects aren't even the problem, it was the Eyebot that was way too slow.
---
I’ve been the recipient of some great gifts along the way. I’ve found great people in this game. When I run across new players  I try to give out some stuff.
---
The mouth on it.
---
&gt; you're burning through what little goodwill is left from this community
---
Man if I had a nickel for every time I have seen this posted on this sub since the game launched.
---
You can receive 1 strangler bloom from project Paradise! I am saving the quest with my last toon, someday I will get my whole group to go and loot, but other then the quest I can't find them, ever.
---
Exactly what I've been saying.  These same people probably denounce bullying, but by ganging up and attacking a 1st subscriber (or vice versa) ..just because they are/aren't one..  ummm hello?  I haven't been attacked yet, someone did make an angry face at me just for wearing the ranger outfit the other day though, lol.  ... I did the Mothman dance as I turned my mic on so they could hear me laughing.
---
Sorry I don't enjoy being fucked in my ass for 60 bucks. This game is unfuckingplayable.
---
Like Fashnacht, the events were notably less populated by the end after the novelty wore off and it became kinda grindy.  I saw several with only a couple people participating in the last couple days. While we were usually successful, I have to imagine there were a lot of servers where the few in the event weren't.
---
Lol ok, so of all my posts, a single one is overtly negative, the dupe removal one is immediately retracted by me the next day when shit worked out well, and that qualifies as "mostly negative", and not bothering to even tally or count how I've been positive in this thread... and I'm the one "flying by the seat of my pants".
---
Cool, cool. GG.
---
So once again, why are they lvl 9?
---
I memba
---
A Bush wookie that made me snort thank you that one
---
I had an Instigating Broadsider drop the other day but I haven't tried it yet.  I'm not specced for heavy weapons, but I am annoyed that my handmade with mods weights more than a naval cannon.
---
Fallout 76 has a relatively small player base so seeing a few people every server with shit-tier Fallout 1st stuff isn’t out of the norm. The only people who stayed with Fallout 76 are the hardcore Bethesda fans and the whales and it’s pretty obvious to see who they want to appeal to lmao
---
If I wasn’t broke I’d give you fake internet medals
---
I don't recall saying they should throw themselves on a grenade for us. But there are still places they can communicate better even in their restricted stance.
---
For example there is a post about heavy weapons spin bug up right now where they say they are "investigating" this four month old bug. It makes them look like shit when they could have just said they are actively "working on" the issue instead.
---
They can do better with the little they can do.
---
swing and a miss
---
I’d love a free 200 lb increase to cap off 1,000 lbs, but maybe we’ll all get lucky and they’ll add that in with Wastelanders or something
---
Buy a ssd. Simple as that. I load into NW lobby and see all the other players just standing there. Then load into the match and loot stuff before my team members are even loaded into the map.
---
Most people on here are fans of Bethesda holding onto the hope that FO76 *is* going to be a better game in the future. Unfortunately, Bethesda seems to want to prove all the critics right and the media beat down they received to be justified lol
---
I build alot. Building can be aggravating. Most of the size has to do with functionality, such as a single light bulb will take up more space then a foundation. The reason is it has a function included into the item. It would be nice if they would include a percentage per item. Which may make them realize then should increase the camp Budget.
---
&gt;rampant cheating on Nuclear Winter
---
FTFY - its harder on consoles but it absolutely still happens
---
I remember... when this was all orange groves...
---
I'm doing the mischief event.
---
I don't disagree with you as far as the points you are making. My point is that this is the business model they've chosen, for good or ill, and it's pretty silly to think they wouldn't protect that business model.
---
Must be your server locale then bc yeah, we drop all the time and half the time when I log in there's already a nuke zone at the Fissure Prime (East Coast U.S. on PS4 FWIW) so other people are def launching frequently too.
---
I have noticed no one drops at Whitespring these days. Not the least bit mad about that.
---
Yes, but please make it Fallout first only for 3000 atoms. We don't want to share this with the rest of the scum.
---
I hope they don’t, but lately it’s been hard to be optimistic in the face of what many consider broken promises and switches. If wastelanders dropped first and then they dropped the subscription a bit down the road, it might have stung less. But, as you say, we’re just going to have to wait. Guess I’ll drown my sorrows in Red Dead 2.
---
No offense taken man. I can completely understand that. Yeah, the game has issues, it has since day one. What Bethesda game hasn't though, better yet, what game in general hasn't? I completely understand where you're coming from, but they can't cater to every individual's needs at a moments notice. They pushed Doom Eternal back because they listened to the community. Am I sad it's delayed? Of course, but I'm also happy because they obviously weren't happy with the game either. Doom is my favorite all time game, right above Fallout. They get a lot of hate, some deserved, some not, but people will continue to buy the games and continue to play them regardless.
---
Im on ps4 also. That's kinda what I was thinking people are doing. Thanks
---
I like this one better. Do one every week now
---
Buddy you made my night.
---
Trap
---
Apparently there is no content between now and wastelanders. Nothing to say, nothing to announce
---
I had the exact same issue. 
---
Read things like it doesn’t auto renew on PS4. 
---
However I did read when purchasing that it will auto renewal. 
---
Didn’t show up in my subs menu under account management. 
---
Sent a email/ticket within Sony’s support section on website and they got back to within a day informing me that it has been turned off for me after I requested it to be. 
---
Frustrating process.
---
I wish I had memories of this game launching in an acceptable state. I do remember when they promised there’d be only cosmetic microtransactions. I had fun with it for the 100 or so hours I played, but I don’t think I’ll be returning to this game until Wastelanders. Even then, the idea of modding being blocked behind the paywall that is private servers bothers me quite a bit. That is if they don’t have modding in public servers which I think is very likely.
---
I'm on ps4. Thanks for the offer I don't need help. I my time online it seems like it has slowed down. I was wondering if something might be bugged and it would be a waste of time and resources.
---
hey if that's what you want to do, then 76 is a good place to create all. not for me but good luck and hope y'all enjoy yourselves.
---
I mean I play it everyday and so do many others so I'd say you're incorrect.
---
Can’t see this happening because it hasn’t already. They’re so slow with adding things to the game and when they do it’s so small. I can’t  help but think if and when Wastelanders is released they’ll just count their caps and end production on 76.
---
That's crazy we barely did anything to destroy robots in that week. More deaths than robot kills. Our KD is bad now
---
holy crap, what a waste of letters this is...
---
I understand that every company has limitations and I appreciate what they are doing with pushing content back to make sure it is up to “Bethesda standards” actual quote btw which I think is hilarious. What I cannot abide by though is selective community involvement during the biggest backlash the game has seen yet with the release of fallout 1st. thanks again for the discussion and sorry if i came off as disrespectful.
---
You know, I want to say this was just those first few updates last year but it's entirely possible I just have enough space now so I don't get that error anymore.  And yeah, I agree, it's a bit offputting.
---
Stw3793/mitchkruse49. Both me
---
Added you.
---
Yup, i rather place around 5 nuka cola quantum sign that that one nuka cola billboard sign
---
spot on
---
 If you died while over-encumbered you could only re-spawn at V76?  -&gt; this is still a thing! :D
---
remember your first lag free queen after they fixed the weight glitch?
---
Bingo they will just get another cheap acct. The hackers are known for sharing  accounts like BeefCurtins for example was several teenagers who blatantly hack! With that said their not hard to track down at all and their very disorganised...
---
No we're just being bitter assholes about it. Personally I don't mind being the resident nuke-dropper in my friend group bc my b/f and I can clear a silo in like 10 mins but it does get a little annoying when it seems others don't want to do the work. That's kinda how your question came off, like you were waiting for someone else to do it. I see now that's not at all what you meant.
---
Private servers definitely play a role, I am getting really sick of dropping on an SBQ only for half a dozen low levels with no business down there to screw things up. So yeah of course I'm gonna prefer a private server where two of us can take her down in less time because a bunch of 20s aren't there making her ridiculously strong.
---
Oh? Did they post how many times players got kicked out of the game trying to do the event?
---
Says the guy that dismisses what I've actually said to create a stilted false reality that supports his narrative of what my narrative is, even though he's factually and proveably incorrect and admitted he didn't even bother to look while actually fundamentally agreeing with the only thing he can find that supports his negativity statement.
---
Right on. That makes perfect sense. Thanks
---
No need for apologies my man! I can agree 100% with you, but people are still going to play whether they complain or not. Everyone just want their 5 minutes in the spotlight lol. Thank you for your time and thanks for the congrats! :)
---
Oh, I'm sure... but seems to be a much bigger issue on PC, from what I've seen.
---
“Enjoy being a bush Wookie for 30-50 matches” 😂
---
Thanks for that reply.
---
I'm LV 13 does that mean I have that cause it's very cool
---
Like the french maid that ends up having a penis!? DAMNIT
---
I wonder if I just fast travel somewhere and back if it will reset it?
---
100% agree with these inside the vaults they make me very angry when i read them. At the very minimum BGS give us details of a list of bug fixes you are working on deploying. But i guess no one is working on them? That's why nothing gets fixed?
---
I play on Xbox and I see tons of Rangers and scrapboxes and robot dances. Did Uranium Fever last night with 3 other randoms. I did the Mothman dance waiting for a spawn, two others joined while the 3rd kept giving us Heart and Thumbs Up. It's not an uncommon occurrence to see the dances, Mischief Night was filled with them too.
---
I keep my tent near Whitespring Station and people use it all the friggin time. I fast travel and hear banjo music, someone's using it. I see people cooking and even using the tent to use as a safe place for ghoul attack. Reddit seems to have more reactionary jerks per capita than other places in the world, I think.
---
I love fallout franchise.
---
I knew this would be a hot mess when it was announced. Bethesda should have stuck to what they were known for...... large moderately detailed sandbox games with an endless amount of sidequests and plenty of room for modding
---
lol lol lol gfto lmao lol lmao
---
am I doing it right? Am I "discussing" two people getting married correctly????
---
It's nice to dream. GL with this wish list. They can't even fix jet packs
---
Big eye roll from over here cap'n. It's one thing to make a claim, it's another to insinuate and try to spin someone else's statement. 
---
But y'know good on ya for sticking to your previous stance of inserting yourself into others perspective.
---
GG
---
people who dont play the game just wanna comeback shit on it then leave until bethesda makes a mistake then come back shit on it, repeat
---
Fucking Evan. I cried a little when I finally killed that guy. Did a little dance in the living room.
---
I can't speak for them, but I don't think that was counter to the point the other redditor was making.  It doesn't look like any assumption was made about what Bethesda would or wouldn't do in that scenario.
---
Sure thing, we'll add it to Fallout First immediately!
---
Should've followed the same advice for 4
---
This happened to me twice by now, and I really enjoyed it too. I spent as much time as I could spare hunting and hoping for some easter eggs, but didn't find any so far.
---
What I still didn't fully grasp is: How does it happen? For me it was like for you - at some point I noticed the surroundings look weird. is there anything that 'turns off' the barrier? (I'm on console too, so, I definitely couldn't have tweaked anything.)
---
No, man. God, no. What the heck is wrong with you?
---
Trap as in: this dude is going to cook and eat you.
---
it was 400 but they raised it by 200 twice
---
They will only get refunded the price they paid tho..
---
bully doesn't like being stood up to GG frien
---
I bet we don't even get a holiday event.  We didn't last year, and no evidence of any more events has been found by data miners.  Not only that, but BGS shuts down for the holidays so their employees can be with their families (which is great, not saying they shouldn't).  So there wouldn't be anyone there to make sure everything runs the way it should (not that BGS makes that a priority even when people aren't on vacation...).
---
there you have it folks!
---
Junk is different. An individual piece of junk is not a unique item like other equipment is. In fact, junk is not even individual in a sense. 
---
Each type of junk is a single entry in a database with the only unique identifier being the quantity possessed by a player and the owner's unique character ID. 
---
So whether you have 1 steel scrap or 10,000 the performance on the server and database is identical (assuming NoSQL database here).
---
Contrast that with weapons, for instance, where every single one is a wholly unique database entity. 
---
Not excusing them locking unlimited scrap behind a pay wall but this was just low hanging fruit on their part.
---
I'm a professional software engineer that deals entirely in backend APIs and databases btw.
---
My thoughts would be if someone you play with has the unlimited stash box and you regularly play with them, have them hold your scrap. Someone could play the role of a banker possibly if they are able to keep tabs on who and how much scrap was given to them.
---
Where is the [falloutfirst.com](https://falloutfirst.com) guy? This kind of shit should be on their website.
---
Every time I see things like that I'm laughing at people who still support greedy lazy fuckers that is Bethesda now
---
Thanks for the feedback guys. Probably have to wait for another update of Windows...
---
You... literally... spun... you inserted yourself... everything you just said, you yourself...
---
Ah, fuck it.

There needs to be custom animations for drinking water for Aristocrats, where their pinky is sticking out while they drink.

I'm running on basically a potatoe. Fx8300 with an rx460... I used to have crash and lag issues but I set all my graphics to low and removed grass and shadows from my .ini.  I haven't had any issues in awhile
---
I was trying to be positive. You are prob right
---
there were no free fast travel events
---
no (camp) vendors to sell stuff for you
---
 (i don't think i saw it listed)
---
Your English teacher called. They asking about what you've done with all the paragraphs.
---
Nice
---
Well I really backtracked my steps and I can twll you in detail more or less. I went to the abandoned waste dump then fast traveled to Tanagra town . Walked south towards the abandoned bunker or whatever it is called but stayed near the cliff. I kept heading east and the next thing I remember was having to step down around a cliff so I dont die. 
---
If you ca  recall your time it happened, that'd be great. I think mine had to do with ft out of an interior cell and maybe something glitchy happened along that cliff becausw there is visual oddities in the background.
---
Id probably take a few out of demo expert and put licensed plumber in there because the explosive ones tend to break quicker
---
Lol
---
oh I just had the same issue and believe it or not it was my monitor.  ive been a IT for a long time now and I just glazed over the basics while trying more advanced tatcics
---
I mean look what obsidian did with the outer worlds, they stated they had a limited budget but the game works great from everything I’ve read and have had no issues playing yet.  Bethesda could easily take a hint from obsidian use something versatile like unreal engine and save some headaches.
---
Heavy weapons are also popular, so are melee weapons...
---
Thing is, you're not gonna use that gauss rifle or hunting rifle when you're getting swarmed by mobs are you?

Eat is ok, just don't touch my nono button

No one? I read all the time on these forums, my group kills queen 6-9 times a night.

I have keycards. I have bloodied weapons. Just need a hive.
---
It is a pristine server.

Just remember to block all friends that play or they can join uninvited.

That’s great.  Time to move to other games.

Fallout 76s story isn’t something to brag about lol, it’s story is about as interesting as the settlement quests in fo4 lol
---
Upgrade required
---
If you enjoy playing this game then I don't know what to tell you. If you enjoy getting fucked in the ass by an incompetent developer I don't know what to tell you. If you're willing to shell out $13/month for features that should have been basic quality of life updates, well I just really don't know what to tell you.
---
The game seems to be poorly optimized for consoles and poorly optimized in general. 
---
I run the game on the PS4 pro and I have very frequent fps drops and blue screens during events or high density areas/mobs. I could only imagine how bad it runs on a regular PS4 or a regular Xbox. 
---
Until they optimize it ( if possible ) you will either have to get used to it or walk away from the game until it's in a better state if ever. 
---
Goodluck !
---
Most of the hate is on here bro.  In game I see a lot of love from other players.  If it bothers you I might suggest unsubscribing from the redit fo76 for a few weeks until some of this blows over.
---
There is a fo76 filthy casuals channel on here that is much more positive you might like.  It really is night and day lol  Definitely dont need all this negativity if your rl has been crap lately.  I'd suggest subscribing to them ;)
---
That just sounds like *Sixteen Tons* with extra steps.
---
You want exploration of the world, play red dead 2 if ya can.  The game looks amazing and if you don’t go questing it can easily be a exploration simulator
---
Wait. There are very different things you're bundling into the same thing.
---
I'm sure that there are people who want this game to die. Forget those people.
---
A lot more people really dislike the game and are critical of both it and Bethesda in turn. These people shouldn't be ignored. A lot of them are very much fans like you but they see the situation for how it is, not how they'd like it to be.
---
It's on us to push Bethesda to make this game better and worthy enough to keep it's player base. Not to plead with Bethesda like they're some misunderstood saviour. Bethesda deserves a LOT of the criticism they're getting.
---
You should be petitioning Bethesda to be better, to live up to the ideals that make it worthy for people to stay and play, rather than begging them to not go.
---
Found the Bethesda shill
---
Awesome! Let me know if you end helping anyone! Although I'm not on PC feel free to message me on here anytime if you need :)
---
My math will definitely have flaws but I keep getting even lower numbers. The best I can do is take the number of Sentry bots killed and try to work from there the maximum number of players that could have been present on worlds where the event was successful.
---
The Event ran from the 29th to the 5th, so those are 7 full days because the first and the last complete each other. That's 24x7=168. If, hopefully, they only count the Sentey bots killed in the event area while active (aka after having light up the pyre), There are three Sentry bots, boss included. There is another one on the other resort entrance but I've rarely seen it get killed since that area is not involved in the event, so 168x3=504. To get to the nearest possible number of Sentry bots killed given in this article we need 787 different worlds that ideally ran the event 24 times a day, with three sentry bots each, and the event was always successful (504x787=396.648). These are "ideals'' worlds because they no doubt didn't exist, but the number is the result of collapsing all the successful event instances (in which three sentry bots were killed instead of two, or zero) into their own worlds. 787 different worlds for a maximum of 24 player per world, a really rough estimation of players who took part in the event is 787x24=18.888. and this is not even unique players, since I alone ran the event at least 50 times, each on a different world since I frequently server hopped to see if somebody sold some outfit that I didn't have to the train station bot (I've found a replicate fireman uniform, and even a fasnatch mask).
---
This of course is assuming that the event was always a success, which it wasn't due to frequent nukes on the White spring that made difficult for the bar to progress for hours at a time (this could move the number of players slightly up due to them not killing the sentry bots and thus not being counted as a world instance), and also considering that all the worlds were always full (which will definitely bring the number down, because worlds are *never* full. 
---
Now, the variables are there and are quite a few, some could move the number quite a bit, but still the number is so low that even in the best case scenario it cannot move up in any significant way. A maximum of under 20 thousand non unique players involved in worlds where the event was successful, for an Halloween event is *nothing*.
---
Sure, this doesn't count all the times the event failed, but really how much could the number go up? And how much more will it go down when only unique players are taken into account?
---
The situation looks bad indeed. We can only hope these poor numbers are due to a 1st related boycott, but honestly I don't think that's what's happening here.
---
In the datamine from whatever patch added freestates stuff shows freestates paints for armors and one is wood, with the mask
---
Hero? Please... He's just a smart arse that did that thing that one time.
---
What do you want for it?
---
What about when x01 mods were mods bought in enclave military wing only. Getting a set of shocks took a lot of hops.
---
&gt;  The only people who stayed with Fallout 76 are the hardcore Bethesda fans and the whales
---
I'm neither of those and I stuck around because it was fun. Not the greatest game experience, but it scratches a specific gaming itch. I'd already paid for it so I might as well satisfy my desire to collect garbage and build a house.
---
Exactly, it should be in the public event rotation or a new event made or something
---
Based off the comment that I initially replied to, the assumption was made that being an ass to people with the subscription would result in the jerk getting banned. I agree, and further feel that *should* be the result.
---
In my experience, it is indeed a fresh instance; I've never had any missing spawns...  however, certain things in the world are character instance based on a timer, and won't be there for a certain amount of time if you've already looted them recently... for instance, I frequently go to the prison for lead, on a private world, the tin can chimes outside and inside the prison will always be there, but the weights in the yard, junk laying around, and the power armor won't be there if I've looted them recently.
---
I'd love to see your build.
---
Edit: and guns/armor.

I'm not sure the issue is with Bethesda so much as the company that owns them, Zenimax. Although the issue could be with both. Either way, I miss the days when I thought a job at Bethesda would be living the dream.
---
I think few if any countries would allow you to refund a year later. You're like that person at a restaurant who ate all but one bite of their meal and then want a refund because of how poor quality the food was.
---
Thank you much for the quick response!
---
I can't say I'm happy with how Bethesda has gone about this, but constantly coming up to a new and unexplored location (for us) that is devoid of enemies and completely looted was pretty immersion-breaking, and this might be the thing that gets us to play together again for a few months.
---
Be more critically savvy. Just because it's on a games media website, doesn't mean it's in any way based on facts.
---
Also, come on, it's Polygon. Unless that Jason guy is posting an article, it's almost always junk.
---
Lmao at believing bethesda will take a suggestion. Maybe tell them to fix the bugs
---
Have you really never noticed that they have easily obtainable weekly and daily challenges?
---
However much u think it’s worth. Unyielding, + 25 rad resist and breath underwater. Height durability too
---
Is this actually happening? I generally solo play and am a 1st subber, haven't caught any flak for my ranger outfit or tent, or anything. Could be just lucky and everyone was nice, or simply didn't care.
---
This happens at the end of a nuke zones half life sometimes.  About 20 minutes before it expires if you go in fresh (aka just loaded into the server or never stepped foot in that nuke zone until that point) sometimes it gives you a wonky number of legos.  Most of the time its glowing ghouls but every once in a great while I've seen it respawn entirely with nothing but level one eyebots also with a wonky number of legendaries mixed in.
---
If it wasnt nuked you walked in just after a nuke zone.
---
Send this to Todd, It's fucking amazing.
---
My experience is that these worlds are shared.  I have encountered workshops with full builds, etc.
---
I think they may reboot in unison, but from my experience you can/may get a world that another player was clearly on at sometime.  My assumption is that once a player leaves a world for 25+ minutes the world will become available for other first players to claim as their instance.
---
I think my fondest memories of the game are before all the gimmicky crap was everywhere. The wastelands had an eerie scary feel to them.  Now it's a freaking circus side-show.
---
Of course I have but I chose not to play the game right now. It’s just letting Bethesda know they can run the game with bugs and we’ll be ok with it. Some might be fine with how broken it is but others are not. Not to mention the fact that there are cheaters and hackers in NW and Bethesda hasn’t done anything 
---
Back to the easy challenges, most give you 10 atoms per challenge. The bundles cost 1600 to 2000 atoms. You would need to do 160 challenges to afford 1 bundle. ONE BUNDLE. There are 5 daily’s and 5 weekly challenges. So you would need to do 16 weeks of Challenges to afford 1 bundle. 16 weeks. This ties into ridiculously overpriced Atom ship prices
---
Well right on then. Still stand by what I said about bethesda though. 👍
---
Dude I server hopped for fucking days to get those.
---
On pc?
---
I remember when SBs (the lvl65 ones for some reason being the biggest arseholes) would endlessly screech at me from every orifice including their anuses as they flew by while playing some fucked up version of 'The Floor is Lava'.
---
I dunno. Some people think it's a good idea to spend $350 to watch someone sing on stage for 3 hours. Some people spend $750 to see people run into each other for several hours over an oblong inflated ball. Far be it for me to tell people what is a "good" way to spend their money.
---
I get it in certain parts of the Mire too, and Im on PS4, so it is def and Bugthesda thing.
---
Explosive energy weapons need to be fixed, the animation should go back to energy beams and the damage to energy type. The explosions can be converted into emp blasts, we have a mutation that does that already, it shouldn't be hard to add the animation to the projectile impact data.
---
And besides, energy weapons as a whole need a huge buff in raw damage. There is no reason why energy weapons should do less damage than their ballistic counterparts if they were considered the best the army had to offer before the war.
---
I know right!   
---
This is gonna be the best.
---
Bethesda’s site is an echo chamber that has doxxed support tickets
---
I am one who loved the the game, but I would love a complete shutdown for 6 months to a year, all hands on deck rethinking the game it's balance, pvp and economies. I feel like wastelanders will be just a small step forward instead of the leap this game desperately needs.
---
Bahaha just some flamethrowers to keep out that pests. Scouts honor
---
Ha, I STILL have 2 shocks and a jet pack taking up Stash space. Can’t bear to part with those souvenirs.
---
while dead it may seem and realization of (eye of the beholder) officially isnt the right term.
---
I was really only addressing the part of your comment concerning the atom challenges, I don't have an argument against the rest of it because you're pretty spot on.
---
Confiding in irony doesn’t send a clear message.
---
What are they one-shotting you with? I thought damage was capped at 100 something.
---
That reminds me of using a camp fire to place items inside my camp. Once had a bunch of water purifiers going indoors. Good times.
---
I added a bit more to the last comment regarding the challenges
---
I read through the whole article, and I can attest to what was said. I changed my icon just so I could avoid a brutal grief from 4 level 250+ players. 
---
I just wanted opinions on the whole class war, because it is a real thing. Just because a couple guys/gals get on reddit and say it's not a thing doesn't make it so. 
---
Maybe my source was not the best, but I was curious as to what the community thought about this new "faction" and class war. Not trying to be clickbait :)
---
I lol'd, but his is significantly better than the ones who seemingly just type and type with zero consideration toward punctuation or autocorrect misspellings.
---
Hmm banking, now thats an idea!
---
&gt; You guys all said how happy you were and that you’d rather us delay something then release it with bugs so we’re doing just that, but with everything. 
---
Hahaha this killed me!
---
Its always some variation of legendary explosive weapon. Last time it was a combat shotgun that had explosive and maybe two shot
---
What platform? If Xbox you can come camp my server and collect you your heart's delight.
---
I wont play with high level with such bad character
---
Smfh
---
Do you play the game or have anywhere near the amount of hours I have in it? If you don't, your opinion doesnt matter to me. Good day sir.
---
It's not the server that can't handle it. Often it's the people's set up and they blame that on server stability. I've seen a lot of people just apparently log off during the event, and my game only froze once. Haven't had a disconnect the whole time.
---
 And I'm on a three years old laptop that wasn't the best when it came out so I'm hardly on a million dollars setup myself. I have to play with the lowest graphic settings.
---
https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Rogu7ioj8Lk/maxresdefault.jpg
---
The fact that there is still any "goodwill" left is why they keep doing this.
---
That would be counter productive and most likely end up with the game fully shut down. Their best bet now is to continually keep working at it while doing qa testing in down time.
---
There's so many competant games out, why play such a terrible quality product?
---
I’m on Ps4 :(
---
Some people have said cooking is easy, no reason to be rude. Those are the easiest for you based on your play through, while other may find swimming difficult if they play alone. He plays solo this is why I mentioned Cooking instead of the swimming. 🤷‍♀️😊
---
If you nuke white springs and do the run you can drop and come right back, the world respawns with fresh mobs. Fif it till the nuke finally dissapated the other day as a test. Not sure if it was patched but was working last week
---
Do you exhale in *h* or Spanish *j*?
---
Are you normally a sole player?
---
I think u just answered a question that has been bugging me, do u regain health if ur hidden in battle, things like regenerating armor, healing factor, etc, does caution stop the health regeneration?
---
Because one foundation is obviously a greater value than two pictures. Duh?
---
Yeah, and? Are insults suppose to matter to me? If I wanted the advice of a troll, I'd go find your bridge and pay the toll.
---
We were happy in Survival. But Bethesda decided to remove those servers and use them as Fallout 1st private servers. So raiding Workshops it is.
---
To be entirely fair - I think they were genuinely banking on Wastelanders dropping in October/November. Even Fallout 1st would have made sense within the context of Wastelanders coming out. Think about it: Wastelanders drops as scheduled, they offer $13/a month to essentially play Wastelanders as a single-player game.
---
Moving Wastelanders left a massive hole in their schedule and upturned everything. Weighing the options... delay and do Wastelanders better and leave the calendar blank and upset some players? Or release Wastelanders even buggier than it will be later and face the unmatched wrath? I can see the logic of the former option... it's not one made lightly, and I could even give them some leniency for having a more barren calendar because of Wastelanders...
---
...But launching First anyway while delaying Wastelanders was idiotic, even from someone who really loves the game and gives the team a lot of the benefit of the doubt.
---
&gt;You aren't addressing the rampant cheating on PC Nuclear Winter
---
this one hurt the most tbh
---
That's a very fair point too, I typically only buy single items here or there so that's probably why it's never been a big issue for me. It'd be a massive time sink if I were trying to grind those challenges to make big purchases on a regular basis. Fuck all that. Forget I said anything, I'm 100% on your side, lol.
---
I think you misread my comment.  I'm starting to think you misread theirs as well.  Either that or you're trying to go off on some tangent about how you *feel*.
---
&gt; My point is that this is the business model they've chosen, for good or ill, and ***it's pretty silly to think they wouldn't protect that business model.***
---
I just don't see how stillasaintstilkilla inferred they thought that way at all.  When I read their comment, they're just making a point about Bethesda protecting their whales, which you apparently concur with.
---
What point are you trying to make exactly?
---
I appreciate the replies guys! I’ll add you all soon.
---
I play on PS4 but there are many who play on PC, I would say it had bad issues but it is not "unplayable"
---
If you shoot an explosive shotgun with Stranglerheart PA, the damage will be too high and the stim will not work. Make poison-resistant MOD, park
---
And? I never said it was, just that the story(as well as actual stuff to do) in Conan and Ark is nonexistent. The developers of those game just built a world for you to play in. They didn't spend a dime on actual worldbuilding or actually putting things to do in their games. Even if you don't think it's good, 76 still has them. So comparing those games to 76 isn't very accurate and if you think they are you are just purposely being ignorant and misleading to serve a position that is apparently too weak to stand if you have to omit these things.
---
Yeah, none of my friends wanna play Fo76
---
I think you're absolutely right. If First had launched at the same time as Wastelanders, and both of them on schedule, the reception for offering the option to play Wastelanders as a single-player game would have been muuuuch better.
---
Some people prefer to see the glass half full.
---
But see, I dont have any problems with the game as it currently is. I'm fine with it. I have no issues playing the game. I have no bugs to deal with, no game crashing, nor am I incapable of doing whatever i like in the game. 
---
I have my own personal criticism of the game, but I see no reason to voice those cause its apparent that people just want to ride the hate train and I have no intentions to give them more fuel.
---
Might I suggest u stop hanging out on the fence and tell everyone to stay off of V9, it hinders the queen from dropping to the ground and if she doesn’t drop to the ground the heavy hitters can’t do their damage, which ultimately is what u need in order to kill the queen in a timely fashion
---
The past 2 weeks have been a bunch of regurgitated drivel. You're right, a total waste of time. So much for transparency and keeping the community informed. They decided to go with the silent treatment instead. We want to know what they're working on, how it's going, maybe post a few teasers, etc. Ok, so Wastelanders is being delayed... What are the issues? Will there be anymore events in the meantime? 
---
There's always going to be a few grumbles, but come on... Tired of the douchebaggery from this company.
---
They can definitely ignore Reddit with near impunity...
---
I'm not going to read that
---
I already am subscribed. I dont go there cause it's an echo chamber of positivity and isn't of any interest to me. I'm no casual in this game nor do I need positivity. Others opinions on my favorite game dont matter to me because I play it how I like.
---
I’ve played a fair share of online games and 76, by far, has the nicest community within the game. The majority of the people who expressed issues with the game don’t even play it. I’ve met maybe 3 trolls in a year of playing. Even after the 1st launch, no one cares if you’re a subscriber, we’re all just doing our own thing.
---
Yes, my fault, sprinkling in some humor isn't always the solution
---
Oh I miss the days of free canned stew! Just like mama (dolce) used to make!
---
Those people are the problem and should be made fun of
---
It is if its a peer into my opinion personally... 3rd person quip not literal.

Sounds like an $8 atom shop idea to me 😄
---
76 is a dangerous world out there :)
---
Christmas music drives me crazy for the few hours I spend at the grocery store during the season.  I think more of it while I’m trying to escape to an apocalyptic hellscape that’s somehow less horrible than real life society is the last thing I want.
---
That’s just my opinion. My wife loves Christmas music.
---
They mentioned a winter event at quakecon, so I'm guessing that's still happening? Or at least they haven't said it isn't.
---
Dude... I dont have that problem... That is only a "Master race" problem... Every game I buy is optimized for my setup.

I experience something weird when I play on my gaming PC with Ryzen processor I never ever met one bug or crash. I was wondering what guys are talking about!

Recently I bought a second pc with Intel CPU and my PC often freezes and I get many blue screen.

Maybe depending hardware you have less problems🤔
---
Not sure how to respond
---
ESO plus wasn't at launch, that came a year after release.
---
Nothing official about that...
---
You guys act like fallout is a life necessity. Just stop playing it maybe?
---
I mean, what are they gonna say? No company's just going to come out and say: "Wastelanders was supposed to be out already. We didn't have a contingency plan, and the amount of work it would take to put a more substantial plan together, with events and so on, would take away from making Wastelanders as good as it can be, so we hope you guys will hang in there despite there not going to be a lot of content dropping."

This is a great

This glass is full alright. Full of Todd Howard's piss.

If it's like xbox you are signed up for a reoccurring payment but have to turn it off on the website.

Yeah, I don't play on PC and I honestly couldn't care less about BR gametypes... but I feel that for my friends and the players that are into it. The videos I've seen are craaaaaazy, and seeing that they banned dataminers but not the NW cheaters is... just... wow.

Hunting rifle modded out weight: 20
---
Pretty sure 20 is the weight of most rifles when actually modded out, so what, for NINE perk points, rifle uses get to save 3 weight on that one gun?
---
I want you to realize even pistols have a stronger weight reduction perk than what you're suggesting.

My husband and I dated for maybe 6 months. We've been married 15 years. Maybe 14. Maybe 16. Can't remember. It's been great so I dinner care how long it's been!
---
We are also a gaming pair.
---
My advice: be best friends who happen to be married to each other. If you keep your friendship, everything else will fall into place.
---
Congratulations!!!
---
Well let's say you pay the $10 a month doing annual membership and play this game for 5 years. Compound interest puts that after 5 years at $615. Pretty expensive for a quality of life upgrade.
---
My husband and I dated for maybe 6 months. We've been married 15 years. Maybe 14. Maybe 16. Can't remember. It's been great so I don't care how long it's been!

Honestly, when I first started playing, this happened to me a few times and it totally made my day every single time. I'm a really skittish player and I had several high levels help me out with Deathclaws and Scorchbeasts when I was really low level. I loved them for it! I'm a level 65 now and get so excited when I see a low level come out of the vault and I drop a bunch of stuff for them. 
---
(And I'm still a super skittish player who doesn't like playing by themselves. Especially when a Sheepsquatch is involved!)
---
That sounds rather complex unless when you start mutate you can't wear power armor, and don't actually grow larger, but still I'd be pretty into seeing such concepts in the future. Especially would be neat in a survival adventure spin off like what the Dust and Frost mods were.
---
Ha, I feel for you. If you happen to stumble into my camp I'll understand if all the radios are turned off upon my return.

You ok pal?

Yeah, they paid $60 last year. They can get a $60 refund.  
---
Then they can buy it again for it's current price of around $15.  
---
Profit ;)

i love nuclear winter its my favorite br and its sad to see it being killed by level 300 cheaters

My short pants have vanished if that count.. i thought i had them in my stash but apparently not!

He is one of people from my group on Facebook, [Mutants Only---Toxic Free Fallout Fan Club](https://www.facebook.com/groups/252786111432423/),   he joined few months ago, and two weeks ago he asked if anyone knows  how to contacted Bethesda, which I recommended him either goes to   official Bethesda forum or [r/fo76](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/), since Bethesda did say they get their feedback from there.
---
Here's  several proof I have, include  screenshot of Mr.Barbera's interaction  with me on Facebook and  messenger, and his family pictures from Facebook.

I'm someone who doesn't play nor like this game. i played the beta (and canceled my pre-order immediately after the two days were done). I don't think the game is terrible. I actually love sandbox survival games where I can build and explore. But I like playing them solo and only with friends and never randoms. You can do this in literally every survival game. You buy the game and you can play offline with no extra charge.
---
Fo76 is bogged down with ridiculous microtransactions. I personally don't care about Fo76. i can live with not liking it and never playing it again. What I do care about though, is TES6 (and to a lesser extent, Starfield). In fact, I'd actually say the Creation Club is the worst thing they've ever done. And here's the thing. I could live with the Creation Club existing if and only if, it didn't affect modding. But in its current form, it does interrupt modding. it breaks SKSE64 causing it to need an update which then has a chance of breaking SKSE dependent mods. They don't care that they're hurting modding for SSE and Fo4.
---
BethesdaNet is terrible. You can't find the mods you want on it while in-game. You have to fight the SSE Creation kit to upload your mods to it. It literally deletes any facegen data.
---
Fo76, to me, is an extension of Bethesda not listening and not caring about these problems that have been around forever.  The first clue for me is when they made SSE and didn't fix a single bug. They had time to make SSE, but not fix the game? Something that's been done by mods already? They're doubling down on microtransactions. They're charging people montly/yearly to play solo/just with friends. It makes me worry how terrible the conditions of future games will be. It makes me think they're only going to have the Creation Club and attempt to make it harder to make free mods.
---
My problem isn't with Fo76 specifically. it's with Bethesda. I've got over 5,000 hours in Skyrim now. Nearly double that making mods for Skyrim. If you count the hours for Oblivion, Fallout 3/NV/4, the numbers are ridiculous. I'm literally in the Creation Kit right now. I love these games and I'm worried that the future games are doomed. Bethesda has already proven they're willing to lie and mislead. They've proven they'll ignore and twist the words of the community. They've proven they'll keep crossing the line and ignore all the backlash. So, when I see this pattern, i see a future where they want only approved "mods" or content added to their games. i see them charging monthly to use mods for their single player games. I see them trying desperately trying to monetize everything and destroying it.
---
Fo76 should have an offline mode and co-op only modes with characters tied to those worlds and not just one character that can go on all the servers. It should have mods available by now so you can mod your offline game the way you want and so you can mode your own servers and have people play on it whether it's a pvp server, pve server, or RP server. Open world online games have been doing this for years already. It's been done. Why do something worse? They aren't taking steps in the right direction. They're constantly doing everything wrong for short term profit. And the saddest part is that there are Bethesda fans who are rewarding them for this. I'm a huge fan of these games. I live and breathe these games. I cannot wrap my head around how many people think all of this is okay. I'll probably be downvoted without anyone reading everything, but I'd really love for them to just turn things around, but with everything they've done, they've proven that this will never happen or at least not happen for a very long time.
---
I can't speak for other people, but I think THEY want Fo76 to fail as a sign to Bethesda that this isn't a good way to monetize and run a game. They don't want Bethesda to be rewarded for what is seen as greedy business practices. I'm just guessing though. Me personally, if I'm being selfish, I would hope they keep all their greedy practices in Fo76 and leave it out of Starfield and TES6 and all future single player titles. And seeing how they make online games, i hope they never make any of the main TES and FO games with online features again. people asked for co-op TES and FO games for over a decade and they made this instead, showing they don't listen to the community. Skyrim Together is more accurate to what the community has wanted for years. Single Player with optional co-op.
---
Well boys let's wrap it up. Time to find a new game. u/DragonicOne has officially announced the game is dead.  Must be true.
---
I feel you in this , I gave up on claiming workshops and set up a camp at an OG raider camp near a fissure site . So a scorched beast spawn point usually distracts them and they just use my camp as a weigh point to scrap and repair their items . ( as I’m typing this , I’m realizing that I’m coming across as a peasant hobbit like character that knows ones place in the world haha )
---
Paragraphs, use them.
---
You should make friends in game
---
Superb, bravo, touche,  upvote the fuck out of this.
---
Ahh
---
How about dogs with the crazy stretched out necks? Hate to say I kinda miss those little guys.
---
Never really had a problem with the queen landing though..
---
Yes now we have an explanation why they removed survival. So stupid this mode was pretty cool.
---
And that's great. We're not really trying to load up on scrap or anything as fast as possible, but we had to jump servers 10+ times the first time we went to Morgantown HS.
---
SBQ dropped serum recipes, shotguns were great weapons, Watoga was one of the most popular spots on the map, the Whitespring was nearly a permanent nuke zone, scorchbeast fights were VATS only affairs because your view was obscured by nonstop screeches, every bloody build wore a clown suit and Fastnacht man mask....I know I’m missing a lot.
---
I still often press R to access my stash.
---
Great write up. They made more progress than I remember. People complain a lot.
---
At what point in your life did you feel reality start slipping away?
---
Nobody is listening to your concerns, has that not sunk in? I don't mean to be rude or anything but seriously, you could cover yourself in glitter and dance the Macarena on their front lawn and BGS would still ignore you.
---
I've been playing since the stress test on the Xbox and now play on the PlayStation and throughout all of that I've met two trolls and with the whole can't take a lot of damage unless I shoot too I was able to ignore them. Other than that everyone is nice hell I started a new character and other players are still giving out water and plans. It's great.
---
Jesus! Wall of text from Hell!
---
I trudged through that cry fest of whiny bullshit. And it boils down to, you don’t like this game. It’s cool, you’re not gonna like every game.
---
I read to here is that what you meant?

---
I stopped playing because of Fallout 1st though, uninstalls are a metric they can see. 
---
I agree with you though, a lot of the hate for it does come from people who haven’t played since release, or never played at all. The game has had a bad rep from the start, and I don’t see 1st bringing in anyone new
---
Hah, well I suppose that renders this entire discussion moot. Thanks for the heads up!
---
They don't want you to think about making the purchase, they just want you to make it then worry about fitting it in later.
---
I thought Bethesda already did that
---
F76 has been dead for a while
---
Yeah I love the whole excuse "we wanted to make sure it was ready" for delaying Wastelanders. But they released 1st, because "it was done". And considering the thing they charged $100 for was a broken turd, I can't even imagine how bad the free content is going to be.
---
Yeah I mean, I wonder why they aren’t at least putting out a “hold up, let us prepare an official statement”. I know that what they say from here on out is huge, but honestly, how is it good business to not even acknowledge all of this?
---
Only if the visuals can be turned off.
---
I'm not writing a book. Its a comment if you want proper grammer and text goto school or a library.
---

---
I genuinely don't know, particularly when ITV was such a massive, well regarded step in the right direction. Even when they fucked up and missed deadlines (see: legendary/prestige player characters), people were so much more willing to take it on the chin, just for keeping us in the loop.
---
Yeah they obviously hired more employees to work on the game and wastelanders because they plan on closing the game down next week.
---
It's like I put on those sunglasses from They Live.
---
Not sure how we wound up swirling around in this conversational eddy, but I'm a little busy right now to try and explain, I have a DnD game to run in three minutes lol.
---
lol we need more of this
---
I attended 3 Nuke launches over the last 2 Nights,i launched 2 of them on PS4.
---
Hardly anyone  turned up for the SBQ fight,meaning 3 fails.
---
First time this had ever happened once,never mind 3 times..Had never even experienced a Fail previously.
---
On the third time it was just me and a level 67,who appeared to be wandering around aimlessly sight seeing,and a level 90 who was at least having a good go.Never walked away from a SBQ fight before,i did it this [time.It](https://time.It) is pointless wasting ammunition.
---
I nuked Whitespring at tea time instead for Flux.
---
Might as well make launching a Nuke worthwhile.
---
I find myself with about a 1000 excess 10mm ammo every other day or so, but I run short as hell on 45 constantly. Literally just give all the 10mm to one of my buddies.
---
Sometimes I get the feeling that Houston's Beth studio just hired a bunch of code monkeys to make the game so now they don't have the fundamental tools to add things.
---
A couple of tips...   
---
- Store all junk before taking the workshop
---
- Take the workshop and be ready to build right away with the contractor perk and with blueprints.  
---
- Build as much as you can before the defend event.  First item should be a stash box next to one of the extractors.  
---
-Place the travel mat in a location close to one of the extractors but someplace where it would be hard to see.  I usually place it in scrub brush or someplace up high. 
---
- Defend the workshop once, get your extractors working, then get out of dodge.
---
- Before you go back to empty things, drop all junk in your stash and go into sneak mode.  You cant be seen on the map in sneak mode. Then fast travel.  
---
- Stay in sneak mode while at the Workshop.  Quickly unload the extractors and stash everything in the stash box that you built. 
---
- Never stick around the workshop to craft, etc.  Always use it purely as a farming location.  Get in, grab resources, stash immediately, then get out.  Stay in sneak mode as much as possible. 
---
- Only do defend events if you really want to.  But this is prime time to be ambushed as they show up as a public event.  Take back events also show up, but when you decide to arrive is more random and harder for a PvP to predict.  Plus, they get bored easily...
---
Personally, I can get any workshop up and running in less than 3 minutes.   I have water extractors, my work bench setup, including stash, and a few security walls blueprinted.  
---
Also, I exclusively use the small power connectors and cables for power connections as they will attach to trees, rocks, etc. and they seem to be indestructible.  Any other power pylon gets destroyed by mobs very quickly.
---
If you crash you have approximately 5 minutes to return before it resets and you are spawned into a fresh sever.
---
Minus any items that you have looted, however as far as I am aware enemies respawn at their locations.
---
Even though looted items have a cool down period there are so many possible items available to scavenge as the map is untouched.
---
Brain cells either
---
I agree.
---
Definitely a significant loss of gamers on PS4 Public servers.
---
:-(
---
Will have to play with myself.
---
Maybe not............... ;-)
---
We're not the ones who fractured it.  The bullies among the "peasants" are.
---
When we're constantly shit on just for enjoying the game, why WOULDNT we want a private space away from the bullshit?
---
Let people enjoy shit in peace.
---
Its random, but they'll all generally be the same level at one time.
---
IIRC, Conan: Exiles does have a main quest: To free yourself from the bondage of your bracelet. It also has religions to follow and level up in, and side quests from NPCs in the world. 
---
ARK might not have NPCs, but there is a central quest to kill the three main bosses and the final boss. It also has some interesting world building concerning Time Travel gone awry, but I can't go too far into detail because I haven't finished it myself, but the fun in Ark was building your base and your army of dinos into something formidable to eventually fight the four main bosses.
---
I saw the ITV about 6 hours ago. But sure, I believe you.
---
What is your usage of .45 vs. 10mm?
---
I doubt we see many XP events at all going forward.
---
Why do that when it's more profitable to put an XO increase consumable on the Atom Shop?
---
Best build ever 👍🏻A new meta is on the way
---
I think we will see them. They make great “content fillers” - we have seen them use xp events in the past to have “something to do while waiting”
---
Get aquaboy/girl.  Hide in water.  Make coffee.   Move to new circle hide in water/bush wookie.  Drink said coffee.  Move to new circle hide in water/bush wookie.  Wash coffee cup.  Move to new circle hide in water/bush wookie.  Find another 3 min task repeat.
---
It would suck to lose anything to pickpockets during quests etc, I am injured need help you great some one is coming to help... Steals instead of saves me... Rage quit
---
How exactly are we violating the ToS?
---
Where does it say it's against the rules to form a private faction within the game away from the bullshitters and trolls?
---
Reminds me of the dopey idiots who bought the collector's edition of Star Wars the Old Republic, trolling over having access to the "VIP section" of the space station hub.
---
It happened to me 3 times too. But I never got what was triggering it. I think FT may be involved to. It's hard to be sure what is triggering it because you could've triggered it at the start of your session and it'll stay like that until you change server.
---
I use the hell out of 45 ammo on my main. My alt is a pistol strength build so I use a bloodied and a ve 10mm pistol. I usually run around with 2-3k 10mm on the alt and very rarely do I drop below 2.
---
If you're on Ps4 I'll gladly drop you some 10mm every once in a while.
---
This happened to me the first time I nuked it. The second time was better, but there weren't very many to kill. The third time was full. I ran it twice because they respawned after about 15 minutes.
---
It seems to be getting better with every time I nuke it.
---
Thank you I was considering cannibalism but since nuke silos only have robots I left it out
---
First thing to come to mind as an explosive build you kinda need fireproof3. As you level over 50 you can def. pick up the guerrilla perks to switch out for higher ROF. With the pipe you could go the double dipping route, but that kinda makes you a rifleman/commando. Black powder might be better instagating, and if you ever see one w/ faster reload, grab it. Also on PS4, hit me up I have a pretty good collection of pistols, psn name same as here ( maybe no "k")
---
Here's the big advantage to the 10mm SMG though: it weighs practically nothing.
---
I agree though - it feels like regardless of level, it's difficult for ammo to be self-sustaining without crafting supplements because the game lacks a predictable symmetry between the ammo you expend to kill enemies, and the ammo enemies use to kill you.  Outside of Mole Miners, who are almost always Shotgun-oriented, and robots with Fusion Cells, you never know what Scorched or Super Mutants will yield.  "Early game" ammo like 10mm tends to be confined to early game locations, rather than enemy types.
---
I lost a ranger hat...no big loss but i did notice it.
---
They missed one stat, actually the most important one...   "4,575,927,479 player disconnects while trying to enjoy Mischief Night"
---
I found that out the hard way.
---
It was a traumatic experience.
---
Buyer obviously realized this also.Started clearing me out.
---
Never moved so quick from my Lazyboy Arm Chair to rip the power lead from the PS4.
---
Costs me about 2000 Caps.
---
When i am nearly maxing out, now i just go and spend 10,000 Caps on Stimpacks/Ammo at other player Vendors.Or buy Bulk Ballistic Fibre at Stations.
---
Always have one Eye on how many Caps you have.

Bffr i pick number 25
---
Thank you fireproof was another perk I was considering
---
As my best weapon is a black powder pistol and I am virtually unable to use concentrated fire automatic pistols are not something I would like to use
---
this happens to me and then ill fast travel away and a whole bunch will fall from the sky where ever i fast travelled to.  It just keeps happing as i fast travel around until i leave the server.

I’ll help you out

Shooting someone in the back is not pvp why not tell the person you have 5min to get a team and have a bit of fun with the atempted take over.
---
yeah, my thoughts exactly.
---
Only 400k sentry bots destroyed? The player count is getting really low I guess.
---
A generic resource with a quantity attached to it is less expensive than a 3\* gun with custom attachments.
---
You have an ID for Steel Scrap and a number attached to how much you have.  It really doesn't matter if that number is 1 or 1,000.  It's the same space regardless.
---
A customized weapon or piece of armor, on the other hand, requires multiple such IDs.
---
For both weapons, my number is 84

Spaghetti

Weird.... Emailing ticklers normally gets a response for me 👍
---
I am averaging 450 - 550 a round.
---
Haha you don’t own an Xbox Boomer!
---
Personally, I'd like it to be 1,000 just because it's a nice, round number and an acceptable stopping point.
---
By that same token, though, for many reasons, I think the Scrapbox should just be a thing everyone has.  Not only does it save quite a bit of stash space, but it improves the looting gameplay to such an enormous degree that the game is all the worse for *not* having it.
---
I'd love to see this gun get some sight options as well as muzzle options :)

Haha well that’s the issue I play mostly on PS4 so these ones are just going to waste here on my Xbox

Yup this is exactly what I’ve done when I bothered to log in the few times in the last month. 
---
I would find myself at least grinding a little bit if there was any sort of incentive to level up, but they haven’t touched in this feature for quite some time so I don’t expect any changes until next year sometime.
---
Your videos get a ton of views. Please do one covering the hax going on in adventure as well. Most notably, the mass duping on pc utilizing cheat engine. And thank god the cheating is finally getting the attention it diserves. Its chasing tons of players away from the game on PC

“Trading” but you give them something then they just block you.

76 bffr handmade

Edit: 67 because 76 has been called
---
Love it!! Kick 'em while they're down!!
---
What if it was some kind of visual mechanic...like all you have to do is turn around and see the player trying to pickpocket you and he gets 'caught'...instant bounty.
---
The cheating is also going on in advwnture mode. Most notably, using 3rd party programs uch as cheat engine to dupe and bethesda cant stop it becuase its not something wrong with their game, its something being forced into the game
---
I can deal with it in tiny intervals, just not every time there’s a radio within earshot.
---
Nintendo was pretty good about doing that as well.
---
This will never be in the game
---
I see why you would say someone playing but not buying isn’t adding value, but that’s completely off. Online games/platforms use a metric to determine daily unique users and this has a huge impact on their funding and resources going forward.
---
BFFr pick number 94
---
Edit: 2 since one already taken
---
Edit again: to avoid any animosity I’ll take 94 instead
---
The game basically is in maintenance mode. Just running the servers and delivering small patches that are supposed to fix minor bugs but they never do.
---
😂😂🤦‍♂️ I prefer french ticklers myself
---
As long as it was kept to junk and had a percentage of failing which would place a wanted tag, I'd be all for it. Could be a fun way to add some mayhem to the game.
---
And btw theres like 10 in each slot besides 1 so before you shit post, at least have your facts straight
---
Well, if by chance I win I will pass my earnings down to someone deserving on this thread.... perhaps a cute female, maybe a youngster, most likely  someone not as salty as the pacific haha.

Agreed. I don't even know why am I not playing the outer worlds yet? 
---
 I have two accounts at 30k each with for vendors full of shit that's probably worth another 30k or more. I've become a fucking online, wasteland used car salesman with post-apocalyptic shit! 
---
I think I spend most of my time in game literally just trying to not exceed maximum caps and running around and doing deals and trades all whilst still trying to keep under that 800 weight limit. 
---
 How is this even a video game anymore?

I love #2, can't stand xmas. Let me remind everyone that there is COAL is this game! Mwahhhahaha.

They are likely trade scammers being called out so no one else gets scammed. It happens quite often, just doesn't get talked about openly because many groups have rules about name throwouts, and witch hunts. Back when I ran a Bounty Hunter crew, we were on permanent retainer for a group of about 20 traders that grouped up, in case they got scammed. When they split up, we worked for one of the Facebook pages. Kept us very wealthy  and busy sadly.
---
So the guy saying that the game is "officially" dead can't even use official grammar.
---
Do they try and trick you into let's say like a "high powered weapon or armor " then block you?
---
I missed mischief night. It would be incredible to have a set of the rewards. Know you said you're not selling or trading but if you're gifting, I would love you immensely.
---
My psn is dtb7591

I gotta agree, daily/weekly/monthly anything would breathe some life into what has become a stale cycle.

Ha, nice one on the carry weight glitch, forgot about that.

You're going to have a pretty hard time if you don't start using better grammar and punctuation on Reddit.

I've been working on a Pistol/Shotgunner who I love to play as, but she took more of a stealth route with things like Covert Operative and armor choices that maximize Agility and stealthiness.  Didn't really delve into the VATS critical side of things though, because she's Bloodied, so I needed Luck to deal with things like Serendipity.

I've heard that Tenderizer doesn't actually work these days, so you may not want to prioritize that.

On the Looking For Group posts it’s easy to scam ive been scam there and mostly a lot of my friends been scammed when someone is new to fallout they don’t know much, scammers try and say they’ll give you something you want or been looking for if you give them something back they tell you to put the item at 0 Caps or Drop it and after they’ll give you something but they just take it and leave and block you and due to not being able to do nothing about the lost item they gloat about it

Did you skip English class a lot? I have a suspicion that you missed the parts where we learned about paragraphs, grammar and run-on sentences.

Yeah like they would say I’ll trade you this for that then make you go first and never give you back your part.

^^^ OMG THIS, SOOI HARD

I don’t think officially means what you think it means. Please feel free to see your way out.
