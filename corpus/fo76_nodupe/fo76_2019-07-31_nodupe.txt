It's annoying because we can't play together :(
---
---
---
Bloodied stealth commando is leagues above anyother recommendation. That‚Äôs not good. They gotta rebalance these builds everyone‚Äôs the same
---
Well then. It might have been just where I finally got to at 40ish was were it was then?
---
Ummmmm NO..  1000's of people have already sorted... THIS IS WHY YOU ASK QUESTIONS ON REDDIT....  See above,  I learned something about them not being specific to SS... Google wouldn't show me that list..
---

---
It literally is the reason message boards exist....   Every day MILLIONS of people ask QUESTIONS to public forums... because it saves time from doing the work so many have already done...
---
Don't be  a jerk when people are using the tools provided in the way they were intended.  GROW UP
---
no idea not have ps4 and pc
---
The technology exists, both the Free states and Brotherhood perfected a method to force them to land, even if in gameplay that doesn't work....
---
Yeah i swear i fast traveled to spot earlier i wanted to go but instead i spawned far away from location i wanted to go lol
---
Fallout 76 doesn‚Äôt know what it wants to be
---
Didn‚Äôt know that ZAX line was specific to the player having mutations, but that‚Äôs good to know.

Since you are mentally handicapped i did the search for you. The search took 0.51 seconds, and here is the first answer i got.
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout\_76\_legendary\_effects](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_legendary_effects)
---
You are welcome. You could have done the same 23 minutes ago. Instead of whining and crying about it like a 10 year old girl.
---
Exactly!!!!! :(
---
I posted something similar some days ago. You consume the plan but don't learn it. I tested it with TWO copies, after it happened and made me feel I was going crazy.
---
Got five comments and got lost in Reddit. SOMETHING IS HAPPENING WITH PLANS AND LEARNING.
---
I need to get a shishkebab on each of my characters so I can heal them, gun bashing with a flamer is very inefficient.
---
How about better rego and a less janky engine? It's probably one of the worst feeling competitive multiplayer games I've ever played and I've been online gaming since the beginning. If it wasn't for the terrible engine NW might actually be fun.
---
The same thing happened to me the last several times, but not every single time. I would say 70% of the time I do Bots on Parade it shows the enemies as friendlies. Xbox platform
---
I've never had a flamer so that is good to know.
---
The slocoms joe usually has one in the grass to the right if looking at the front of the building.
---
Across the road from slocoms is a tree, with 1-3 on it. It's near the stream.
---
Further up the stream, maybe 30 meters, are 1-3 more.
---
Now if you go back to slocom Joe's, and head to the abandoned house slightly up the road, and also following the train tracks behind it, it's about 50 meters, there will be one near the shack behind the house.
---
Finally, travel to vault tech Agricultural center. The basement has 1-3 if no one cleared it out.
---
That's my run. If you have green thumb you'll have at least 10.
---
If you need snaptail Reed and blood lead for disease cures, that stream behind the wayward will top you off.
---
So you could essentially fast travel to slocom Joe's, gather firecap where I told you, and then follow the stream to the agricultural site collecting reed and leaf, and be done in about 5 minutes.
---
If you have chemist/super duper equipped you'll have about 15 disease cures and 10 healing salves if you also grabbed sootflower along the way.
---
I do this run about twice a week.
---
That's a good tip, though I have had a lot of awful experiences with some random players recently so I'm a bit hesitant on relying on them too much. (not saying there aren't a lot of nice players though)
---
Exactly as I said when working on settlements in 4 you could hanging lights on the wires between power connectors
---
True but so did most other MMOs at launch.
---
 Destiny 2 was dreadful and catered toward journalist's so the content was far to easy.
---
Then the game released and the hard core players changed it to raids and dungeon since they where much harder.
---
The shishkebab swings faster, more hp per hit, at a lower stamina cost! Gunbashing with a flamer is just not viable.
---
AGAIN... I never would have known they weren't set specific.  It's amazing how rude people are to others that simply ask a basic question in a forum DESIGNED for asking questions. Instead of just moving on with nothing to contribute, you had to "prove" to others with a condescending attitude, that you are superior.. 100% uncalled forBe a better person, instead of one of the problems.
---
Thanks for this, I've been trying to post some photomode photos off fo76 to this sub and hasn't been working
---
Here‚Äôs what you do, put your vendors in a building with garage door. When you are near max caps cut power to the garage door.
---
I got an explosive bloodied Minigun
---
It wasn't my first, but I had some hamm's and thought I'll hit the bog, prime, and the other fissure site. Then when I fast traveled I was like... Nobody will show up. Ha.
---
&gt;  I never would have known they weren't set specific
---
Did you try search it in google?
---
So, don't travel to that location. üòê
---
Better management, for sure. They have definitely been getting bug reports since beta. It would appear as if the the head of the team doesn‚Äôt want the team, and is happy to let the game flounder rather than fix the game and get promoted onto another team. Too bad, as this game could make them so much more money if it was a more noob-friendly game. I mean for how many years have we asked for simplified menus? What have they given us? _More_  menus. It also feels like the team themselves see this project as punishment, like, you get put on 76 when you fuck up
---
This is some quality information. Thank you very much sir. If I had reddit money I'd toss a silver or gold your way.
---
It wasn't made for PvE players. Not our fault they died.
---
Yes! That's my next camp build plan actually! üòÖ
---
With a fixer and they were in a stealth suit. Does everyone on your team have to have pacifist on? Because before the big update one of my husband team mates fought back and then he and my husband were killed as a result of the team mate firing back.
---
Yeah I could see that but the issue is vats critical damage.
---
I like the idea of hip fire damage should have passive damage increases based on critical damage maybe only on a headshot.
---
Scoped weapons should benifit from stealth damage bonuses when not detected or it could also be passive.
---
Sure. How much?
---
Jump and run as soon as you spawn lol
---
Meat week is coming, that reward is an extra meat week, just like last year event when we had to kill scorchbeasts to earn rewards
---
If they're actually rare plans and not recycled loot pools from the presents and miner pails.
---
edit: looks like it is recycled. 
---
https://imgur.com/a/euUyeL7
---
So the rare plans are pretty much useless unless they add something new with the event.
---
It happens when I haven't even played Nuclear Winter that day! It's been a constant since wastelanders!
---
&gt;Yeah it's inconsistent with the rest of the game.
---
The Malone gang leader sends his regards.
---
Still, could do with fixing all the same.
---
The event used to be a mess.  People dumping ammo into the ISS while it was invincible, people taking the pylons and dying seconds later, people running in to melee it and getting blasted cause of their hopelessly glass build.  And of course, the vultures waiting in the wings to unload zero damage onto it when it does become vulnerable, and do nothing else until then.
---
It seems like people have the whole thing figured out much better than they used to.  I personally go to the event everytime it's up if I can.  Though I have to make sure I can put my better armor on or it ends awkwardly.
---
You're welcome.
---
Yeah true I guess, I don't even use them since I never get my preferred gun. When I do I mostly use the pistol damage increase and hope I get an laser auto pistol.
---
Steam had responded to me saying Bethesda had responded to them and they know its an issue and working on it. Either way id still spam both of their customer services. They need to know this is an issue.
---
I need a FSS shish as mine is still slow.
---
It's just Vats burns down to a FFR over 120 damage. Who ever has the higher FFR wins. Not skill based or really even perk based other than how fast you can shoot.
---
I've lost track of how many spears and pole hooks I've gotten from the Purveyor. But today was the first time I've seen a legendary 10mm pistol anywhere and I've been playing the game since beta
---
The fact that it kicks you out to the main menu after every round is ridiculous. Why not just find another waiting lobby and drop you in? If that‚Äôs too difficult for Bethesda to program, they have no business even advertising a Battle Royale mode.
---
For new players aka fresh money, of course they would.
---
For existing players though we get cynical recolours &amp; icons
---
I just use a vampires reduced weight version, it doesn't heal on every swing anyway, seems to have some sort of cooldown.
---
Level 2 ZiamCann9on. I just literally downloaded the game this morning and am now scrolling through Reddit checking out all the topics. I'll probably not be on until the weekend
---
For every donation you make you get a donor reward box which you open like the Miner pails and Holiday Gifts and are awarded random loot from the same table. It states armor and weapons so I am unclear if the backpack plan, outfits and camp items etc will be included in the loot drop. If the donations the community makes reaches the target then the reward or event or whatever unlocks for everyone regardless
---
I'd like to point out how ridiculous it is to have a season where someone is worried about completion if they can't play for a single week.
---
I run the tunnels while killing everything. Its not hard. If 4 to 5 people did 1 full run for ore it would be all it would take. Ive done events were we get 80 to 90 ore and not one other person will do a quick run. I dont think they understand that the ore spawns separate  for everyone.
---
Still in the process of making some cannisters for a pauldron, overall quite pleased, loving the job so far.
---
**Edit**
---
I see I'm being down voted? Sorry if I upset some of yall by posting a creation, apologies
---
Are you on Xbox? I have a pretty good route I could walk you through.
---
I run most of my games in borderless windowed, because my monitor is a little weird when I run games in fullscreen. The game seems to run better when I play it in borderless anyway.
---
There is currently a bug that makes the helmet not appear at armor stations. You did get it though.
---
Mutations are an excellent addition and I would love for them to be more immersive as an experience. Seeing NPCs with them is great, but that should come with visual changes, players might hate them, so you could make them toggleable, but here's what I would like to see:
---
Bird eyes/discoloured irises for eagle eyes.
---
Green skin/a slight glow for unstable isotopes.
---
Skeletal facial structure, or just a straight up ghoul transformation, for plague walker.
---
Goat horns for herd mentality.
---
Maybe antennae or a third eye for empath?? That one is tricky.
---
Scaled up feet or thigh muscles for marsupial? I'm thinking a bit like a satyr, goat like legs, similar to the perk card. I think even if you made it so that you couldn't equip leg armour because it had it's own model, people would still use the mutation. That could even introduce a new balance to a pretty OP mutation.
---
Grounded could be ashen or stone like skin maybe?
---
Bird bones is another tricky one, because like marsupial, I think they would need to add custom models, and bar limb armour. To me when I think of it, other than being under the skin and invisible, you could have the arm split, with a gap in the forearm, signifying hollowness. Low chance anybody would pick this instead of armour though lol.
---
Healing factor ought to come with lumps and growths, 100%. You can't heal all wounds 300% quicker without making excess cells. Alternatively if the cancer route is too grim - I guess big, healed over battle scars would be cool, picture of Dorian Gray style.
---
Charged should make your veins or eyes glow blue, or alternatively the character should emit a constant hum/vibrate.
---
Talons is obvious.
---
Scaly skin, also obvious, but could look quite bad if not done well, I think I would prefer patches of scales as opposed to an argonian texture slapped over a human model.
---
Carnivore = enlarged canines/vampire teeth.
---
Herbivore = either beaver-esque buck teeth, or maybe mushroom and leaves for hair?
---
Egghead = I don't like enlarged heads, even if it makes sense. Maybe your character's hair falls out? Alternatively, I guess glowy or visible veins at the temples? Or the comic book classic, white hair at the temples.
---
All solid advice.
---
Also if you find yourself on a server with back to back Scorched Earth's go ahead and start it after the third nuke. Just give them time to prepare before actually starting the event at the terminal.
---
You may very well be right. Wastelanders was already there when I started playing. I didn't experience this "feature" until I started doing NW events to get that S.C.O.R.E. up. You are the second one to say that you've gotten it without launching NW at all. So either I'm wrong about the trigger for the bug, or there is more than one way to trigger it.
---
Could it be switching between any of the modes? Is it possible you were going between private server and adventure?
---
Cannot address mental health: intersects with an existing object.
---
What I did for this was remove my repair condition perk cards, craft a low level crossbow, and then melee a bunch of low level enemies to bring the condition down enough for a repair. Good luck!!
---
Just get Pharma Farma perk to 3 star and roam around.  You will be swimming in them.
---
to my knowledge the closest thing might be the orange halloween event jacko pant suit? but until that (maybe?) comes back this year its only obtainable via trade with another player! i bet this character rocks.
---
Am I the only one who wants a 76 subreddit where you make characters from shows or games and show them off ?
---
I've not had access to private servers for about a week now since 1st ran out, so yeah it's not just a change in modes.
---
It feels good to 2 shot a hopper with a lever action though! As they try and spam you with the guass shotgun
---
vats is kinda cheating. i would prefer to not have it at all but from another side autoaim itself is musthave mecanic for xbox and ps4 .
---
Please allow for the possibility you‚Äôre mistaken.  
---
If you have pacifist on another player cannot kill you with a rifle.  Period.  It just didn‚Äôt happen.  
---
Now, it is possible to use radiation to kill another player, but that‚Äôs pretty extreme and most won‚Äôt bother with it.  
---
76 started out as a PvP game at its core.  Over time, the PvE crowd took over and influenced Bethesda to remove most aspects of PvP.  
---
Your post sounds quite passionate and I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre upset.  I‚Äôm just not sure it‚Äôs justified.
---
I also assumed itd be atom shop too, but after they all but confirmed in an interview that we‚Äôd be getting a BoS themed season, it makes the most sense being vertibirds are about the only uniquely BoS themed PA skin they could do given Liberty Prime is already an atx item. Maybe we will get an alt colored version like the captain cosmo one as well.
---
Make use of the vendor bots. Sell any chems you dont use. Sell water. Its a bit naughty I guess but if players have their water purifiers unlocked at their CAMPS then the general consensus is they are happy for players to help themselves. Dont be greedy and clean them out though. Cook up any meat you can find and sell it to vendors. Sell any weapons you find. Scrap junk and bulk what you dont use and sell that too. If you have the points in CHR and can get the perk then equip Hard Bargain for the boost in prices, Butcher Bounty gives a chance at double meat, Scrapper for scrapping weapons &amp; armor yields more materials to use or sell
---
the explosive might be great for mob killing but i feel like for bosses the ffr might do you better and up equating to more dps? sorry i don‚Äôt have a finer metric for ya, but i‚Äôve found on my commando to prefer ffr generally but both are super fun!
---
also, i could be 2000% wrong but i maybe heard something about certain enemies like the SBQ having some kind of explosive resistance? which i guess would make ffr better. idk, the levers so powerful already both would definitely be great but maybe being able to pump more shots into boss fights quickly would net better results. at the end of the day though, whatevers more fun!
---
Oooooo! That is EXCELLENT advice.  Thank you!!
---
This kind of as...players, and the ones that try to kill others at the end of a nuke to steal their things i guess? I crossed some of those already, and one with god mode for what I've been told, starting fights around, really annoying
---
What's your GT? I can give you some (reg. &amp; super) in a couple of hours. Currently at work.
---
Oh! I see. Thx a lot!
---
Sorry that image was just too funny, an entire farm gaggle going into battle.. 
---
Agree with the server issues that would happen though
---
Enjoy!
---
To be honest I was guilty of a few of those during the first time I joined it ( I was running bloodied at the time) activated the pylon and instantly died, I was really confused and felt really stupid and was sorry when I realized what I did, though the event was still completed successfully, thankfully.
---
I was thinking I should switch over to a rifle instead of melee for the event when I start grinding it but I am not sure if I should rather go for SS armor or power armor but I guess I'll just test what works for me in that case. I am curious about what your "better armor" is though.
---
And thanks a lot for your thorough replys, you are a big help.
---
Yeah it does but its still a pain.
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
I'd like an ed-e my buddy my pal
---
You can only build so Hightower my understanding
---
OK! I'll try more. Thx for help!
---
If stimpacks are your problem make healing salves. They are free and work almost as well. Walk up and done the river in flatwoods collecting water, Bloodleaf and soot flower. Make at a cooking or chemistry station.
---
I sent a PM thanks! :)
---
You need a running buddy on xbox? Level 16
---
Ill also add take advantage of events. Many of them drop stimpaks as rewards and you get caps too. Stick with the level appropriate ones
---
True but it would defeat the purpose of bringing your build if you had to obtain your mutations and stuff.
---
Maybe some sort of selection of pack of items/mutations would also work.
---
I've seen alot of 3 story structures though, so I'm unsure what they're doing to be able to make it a 3 story
---
im so used to NW that I forget that you can vats players in adventure mode, and end up just killing them with free aim.
---
You laugh, but I‚Äôve totally had someone just sit at my camp to pillage my Brahmin shit, presumably to make grenades or something.  I tend to be semi idle at my camp, dude was there for an hour or so.   I‚Äôm guessing you ran into someone who doesn‚Äôt take kindly to shit thieves.
---
I know it‚Äôs not as epic as blowing up enemies with nukes but my fight with 1 Star lv 50 Legendary Scorchbeast, lv 50 regular scorchbeast, a mirelurk king, a few mirelurks, and some scorched was fun, but maaaaan was I sweating bullets! 
---
https://youtu.be/bruoHra_z78
---
Yea you don‚Äôt need them to break completely, just damaged enough that they need repairing.
---
Once your format the ssd for games, you are able to transfer them from the XB1 hdd to it without doing anything else to play Fallout. I'd recommend getting a regular sata based ssd rather than an nvme like the t7 because the XB1 uses and USB 3.1 port so you won't get to the speed advantages that a nvme ssd offers. The new xbox will have a proprietary external ssd so we can't use the ones we have now.
---
Unfortunately we could only get Sanjay.... lol
---
Ammo weight reduction mods on the arms would be great, because its free heavy gunners up to use their damage perks to its fullest and carry loads of ammo!
---
Good idea
---
That's what i thought when i first read it lol
---
I hadn't we even that about having everyone load the map and then begin the game lol.
---
You can still upload to imgur or any other hosting site and link here.
---
It's actually not that much of a grind. You need 10,000 players to give 12,500 steel each over 5 days so 2,500 steel a day each. But assuming there's more than 10,000 that number comes down.
---
Does this mean the same loot pools as previous events?  I'm confused
---
I hate seeing people downvoted for asking questions,  but you seriously are better off looking at the lists people made on the site the other guy suggested. 
---
If you have a question about something specific people are more than willing to help I've found.
---
Thanks for the childish insult.  Reddit is for questions and discussion, THAT is exactly what I did.  There was 100% no need for you insulting, wasting your time.  Nobody was crying at ALL. In fact, if you read.. .all the threads where I wasn't being insulted were actually productive.  Maybe just be a better person or move on.  No need for the attitude, that is what ruins communities and games.
---
Not that I owe you an explanation, but I was in Reddit in multiple discussions. I merely used the app I was already in and continuing my other discussions. It was more efficient.   Why would i go to a different website, when I am on a website that is built FOR QUESTIONS.   
---
If it wasnt' for the smarmy remarks, I wouldnt' have spent any additional time in this thread, People like yourself that dont' like questions and thrive on insulting people, made me extend my stay.
---
That's hilarious. You could get so much more fertilizer just server hopping at the right locations. I know that one area by Flatwoods has a bunch in the back.
---
I am on xbox.
---
If they goo pile or ash pile when they die they respawn like this. This is actually a (small) step forward, they used to remain ash/goo pile until the end of the server.
---
Afaik sbq is virtually immune to explosive damage
---
Will turn the mind boggling decision to unban dupers with ALL their items intact into a slight positive.
---
Right.  The team that worked on NW got pulled to help with Starfield according to sources, which is why the mode hasn't received much love beyond seasonal cosmetic rewards.
---
Pretty much, so unless they have something new for the event, you're just getting the same stuff from before. And if they did add something new, it has to compete with all the other stuff. So good luck getting anything actually rare.
---
I'm glad I decided to look this up. At 12 seconds for each water it would take you 20 minutes to collect 100 dirty water. Or you can do it at a river in about 20 seconds and pop a radaway, which is a lot cheaper than a week and a half worth of bullion. 
---
Now if it had been a dirty water collector that passively collected dirty water like a water purifier I'd have been on board. Why can't we cook with purified water again?
---
Nah, I'm good, I found them shortly after I asked. Someone messaged me a link immediately.  I've just been defending myself from unwarranted childish attacks.  Thanks though.
---
No kidding.   Not to mention, I‚Äôve run a heavy/demo build since day one, I‚Äôll run out of aluminum before I ever run out of fertilizer.   Idk what someone has to be doing to run out of feces.
---
I like the idea on most of these. Of course, unstable isotope should be due to Americium, so the green glow sounds better.
---
As for Plague walker - additional thinness or perhaps being more pale would make sense.
---
You also missed adrenal - the character should be skin and bones for that one.
---
Kind of true, they changed vats recently to include hip fire accuracy more in its calculation.
---
Hence why people have been complaining about it recently. I bet you would find only people who run and gun truly being shut down by vats.
---
 Sneaking basically removes vats play.
---
thats crazy. wonder why the explosive gat plasmas are so rampant against her then? perhaps their damage output just negates the need for the explosive to work? idk
---
The more you run the silos, the smaller they get.  Thirty minutes to run it as intended is very good time!   Nothing stopping you from doing that every day now.  Welcome to the club!
---
The gift one works well for the ‚Äúdropping a bag‚Äù emote, I‚Äôd say
---
You used to be able to mod the combat knife from two different versions of the standard blade. Not too sure if that's still in the game, but it's how I got all the mod melee weapons character challenges
---
I made a post with it and I'm just getting down votes. Unsure if its cause its pictures or people just don't like it
---
I‚Äôm curious too.  Haven‚Äôt had a chance to ever use one
---
Thanks for sharing this
---
If you want to message me your GT I'll add you. I should be on tomorrow. I have a private server I can run you through the route. Like others have said, Slocum's Joe is the best starting point.
---
I got the last cap reward last night, had to stop and "de-cap" before I could take it. No caps as rewards please Beth, especially with nothing left to buy.
---
You have no idea.    I am at least a couple hundred in.   I am still missing a few of the paints.     I have the worst luck.
---
The build area is a sphere so when you first place you CAMP box thing it has to be higher to build higher.
---
I have the Baxter Building 6 floors plus a secret basement because I placed the camp box in a tree.
---
I use mine because why not? it's 90% reduced weight, and throws out green jizz like a person with epilepsy ejaculating in a nightclub mid seizure, and it explodes too!.
---
Desk fans, globes, typewriters, silver lockets, hot plates, pretty much all toys, combination wrenches and probably a couple more that I can‚Äôt think of right now.
---
Edit: giddyup body‚Äôs
---
Also camp on a junk pile and set your collectron to scrap (not junk)
---
Thanks, the dmg on paper would indicate explosive.  But I think dps wise the AA one would work better.  I know AA is multiplicative, so not sure how much it‚Äôs really doing in combo with tank killer 
---
AFAIK too, SBQ is resistant.  But usually swap for The Final Word for her.
---
I think a lot of people are worried that they might be buying dupes and they might get banned.
---
I saw some decent stuff for sale the other day but it seemed to good to be legit.
---
For builds where you have to get close means you need to ambush players!
---
I was thinking this very same thing a few days ago.  I would always look out for better Unyielding or troubleshooters armour, but not anymore - Im grinding for the SS armour now so I dont even bother looking at the armour category in a players vendor.
---
Im happy with my B Fixer and BE handmade so no need to look at weapons either.  
---
Ammo - usually overpriced and now I can trade in unwanted ammo for the one I want.
---
Theyve really killed player vending and it would be good if they could somehow give us a new interest in it.  Not just the daily quest of buy 3 items from a player...  tired of selling 1 ammo three times to another player.
---
Oh yea Stealth boys Marklll and secret agent (I think that's it's name) I hold it down in PVP, especially now because VATS is broken in workshops. I dont really like PVP in general, but since I can't see what workshops are claimed I just fall into it. 
---
I dont take any junk and eventually if they come back for more I give up the workshop. It can be fun if no one is a d*ck about it.
---
Stop eating at Cracker Barrels. The boh is always a filthy wreck.
---
I miss Mr. New Vegas.  I want him back
---
Had a noob drink 5 not knowing what they were. He later messaged me saying that his game kept fast traveling and thought his game was crashing for a few minutes
---
And there is a damage cap of 120 so any higher is a waste. Just the faster fire rate.
---
I was bored one day so just kept walking south...and walking...and walking.  Actually went off the map.  Couldnt believe how much unused map there is , and theyve gone to the trouble of making the environment interesting to look at...
---
I apparently missed out on a bunch of free things for FO1st because when I wasn‚Äôt playing they released but took away some armours for some reason. And they were really cool
---
Also vote for pharma farmer. You'll have so many stims you'll soon be selling them due to weight.
---
I always thought that some form of a transportation that we control would be really cool . We would be able to enjoy the land more than we do with fast travel
---
Can confirm pacifist is on. My husband just checked. Positive it was a player because I got the seek vengeance and respawn thing. I chose respawn. To be clear he went to settings and checked pacifist was on.  Regardless I will probably play again at some point. I just don‚Äôt like the idea of getting killed by another player after a hard days work. I do love this game but not all of it. Like I originally said it is much like life. Sometimes you just gotta deal or find another game in this case. I have enjoyed a lot of the game but not this part. 
---
This is Not the first time this kind of thing happened. I had a random person come to my camp and just started shooting at trying to get me to engage. I simply hopped worlds as I don‚Äôt want to deal with it. Trust me I do understand the rules of engagement.
---
Commando users are in need of decent Handmade and Fixers, but shotgun and heavy gunner builds will just use the gold items now.
---
Lol yeah it isn't very hard except when a damn assaultron gets a lucky head laser shot and you have to run through it to where you were.
---
Thank you :) that helps a ton, but my stair problem isn't build height related
---
You're the fucker I thought about when I came up with my indoors glue garden. Lmao
---
I hope you never take over any workshops, you will not like the outcome....
---
The only part of silo runs that I hate is the babysitting at the end.   I love the rest, great spot to pick up ridiculous amounts of steel for ammo crafting
---
Yeah. I do that: jump and run with more fear than being attacked by a diseased radroach. Lol
---
Yeah very true. I don't know what they should.
---
They should fix and release the other pvp events in particular the presidential race event. You had to go to the polling booths on the map and vote for yourself which could be contested by other players.
---
Flag these events as pvp public events where your public team would join and even work together.
---
To make this truly enjoyable they need to nerf remove or ban the legacy weapons.
---
Is it just me or is this really lame? Reskins drive me insane, so maybe it‚Äôs just my personal preference, but I‚Äôd much rather have an exclusive unique item to commemorate something like QuakeCon.
---
I actually LOVE that Summer idea. Make NW themed to the season for a while. Or, instead of just time limited rewards, make a time limited mode WITH rewards, akin to Apex Legends. Bring it back each summer with additional rewards to encourage revisiting the mode.
---
Honestly, there's so much that COULD be done with multiplayer Fallout. I know a stereotypical PvP isn't what people think of when they think "Fallout", but it could still be fun regardless! I personally really enjoy NW (though I play purely teaming with random players, so it's a crapshoot on player skill), and think the idea of pitting survivors against each other makes sense. I just think they might as well put more traditional PvP (or even PvE) modes in to give players SOMETHING more than just Adventure and a battle royale mode.
---
It‚Äôs not an oversight. It‚Äôs to make people want to buy the bundle. Every bundle has a bundle exclusive item.
---
And dilute them on a chem station. You‚Äôll get 2 ‚Äúsmaller‚Äù ones for every 1 stimpack. I often didn‚Äôt need a whole stimpack but a half when I was wounded. 
---
Also eat for health regen (hot key!) and sleep in a bed when possible.
---
I do it on a private world so I don‚Äôt have to deal with pvp.

"Instead of taking out the one nuclear winter daily challenge, we make  all, or some of the daily challenges have more then one way to unlock."
---
As an example, either kill 10 in ghouls standard, or kill 3 animals in NW to unlock the daily.
---
So people who do not like NW can skip it and still do all the dailys, and people like me who do have fun in NW, can do more of our Dailys in NW. It is a win win.
---
i can give you some aid now if you're on.
---
Yeah it's probably to do with people finding out what they like or what's good, vs just getting something that's new.  
---
Hopefully with the BOS being added they either rework some weapons or add new variants to each class which will likely keep people buying. 
---
I mean, the gauss weapons are cool, but since we can't sell those they dont add anything to the economy. 
---
Unless I'm dumb and they do.
---
But hey, then there's people like me looking for fancy melee or unarmed weapons. (Which they should add more of that aren't tied to events).
---
The newest free icon is actually good but I get your point
---
Well i stop looking because i am grinding crimson flux for ultracite ammo and dont need armor well basically the new stuff is better than the old dont know about legacy
---
Yeah I have also advocated turning workshops into tower defence events that have more rounds and have legendary enemies.
---
A bit like a survival mode from something like left for dead, you lose once all your extractors blow up.
---
My bad, I only got the game recently and assumed they had NW at launch. Doesn‚Äôt surprise me that it took them a year. üòÇ
---
Give these a try:
---
Sugar Grove has an abundance of desk fans and antique globes which yield a high number of screws.
---
National Radio Astronomy Research Center has a wide variety of antique globes, desk fans and typewriters.
---
Charleston Capitol Building has around 12 typewriters.
---
Charleston Herald building has 4 typewriters, a Carlisle typewriter and 2 desk fans.
---
I sell nothing but 3 \*'s in my weapon vendor.  I price every weapon at 499. Doesnt' matter how god like the rolls.   All my ammo 1, stims 10, Super stim 20, and Radaway for 20.  Also, all  camp item plans sell for 20 and all other plans 99 (Yes all plans regardless).
---
I list those prices, because I have non stop people buying from me.   I'm like walmart and sell so much i'm almost perm stuck at the cap limit.
---
I just dont' have the time or want to bother with "market"... I make my own and it does well.
---
Ignore the downvotes. Complaining about them entices others to pile on.
---
I cannot help but wonder if we can donate after the limit is reached. I ask because there are FO 1st players that have 100k of steel and other junk that a casual player could never carry, and not to mention the duper‚Äôs who have god knows what in their inventory.
---
Yeah true so I need to be a bush wookie to kill a bush wookie.
---
I haven't had any problems selling stuff. Weapons, plans, ammo, serums, aid items, whatever.
---
I wish there were more Classical, and less of 'Country Roads' or 'Wouldn't It Be Nice'. Toss in some Rachmaninoff, Grieg, and a bit of Stravinsky.
---
Any idea if the Atlas loot pool will include the likes of the Miner plans? I'm fine with waiting for Halloween or Christmas to try to get some of those plans (I didn't play around that time last year), but considering I only got one Insurgent plan during the recent Miner event, I'd be happy if it included that set. Heck, even some power armor plans would be nice, just so I don't have to grind quite as many caps.
---
It seems more and more people shoot blue light from their weapons, so I think you have a point.
---
Remember when everyone thought they were gonna put too much effort into NW and leave Adventure mode in the dust?
---
Do we know for sure that people are being banned just for having the blueprint?
---
In the room where you switch out the main frame cores, there‚Äôs a door that can be opened with a terminal, it‚Äôs across from the main frames terminal.  Open that door.  It‚Äôs a quick shortcut for if you die beyond this point.  Will save you a ton of headache.
---
Lol, the melee is pretty janky, I think they need to have access to vats in pvp.
---
That sounds right.  Wastelanders was supposed to come out and then perk loadouts in early 2020.
---
Well when you've got turd burglars around, you have to be careful. Looks like you went over to steal those turds!
---
Yep, marketing 101!
---
I've heard reports both on Facebook and some discord groups, claiming that they hadn't even placed it yet, only the blueprint. But then again lots of people are also getting away with abusing it too so, Bethesda being inconsistent again!
---
Don‚Äôt forget the deadly iridescent frogs!  I kind of want to try and tame one now.   Don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd like to replace it with my Mirelurk Hunter though
---
I think you'll be fine. Through the Atlas update (patch 21), there is likely to be another double score event if players meet a global achievement.
---
Also, they upped the daily score to 9 challenges per day, up from 7 previously. Now you don't even need to play every day to make it without spending a single atom.
---
The run also gives you about 2k atoms iirc, which is enough to get you through 10+ levels, without spending anything, and allowing you to not play daily particularly if you save atoms for the final 10 levels, which have the highest score requirement.
---
Tl;dr: bethesda fixed requiring players to play daily to beat legendary run.
---
Yes and be able to upgrade the minigun with the gauss and faster speed
---
I put them in my Nuka Cola machine since no one takes them from my Keg or Party Bowl.
---
I think they're fun and wish more people had bowls in their CAMPS.
---
i usually grab a load and let others do what they want. And when i know i have enough to make it 50 i insert

As long as it has many bushes.  Deep large bushes that I can just slide into for whole minutes at a time.

Ive been griefed on xbox and i was so sad because my base to me like2 hours since its an elaborate base
---
Shout out to all the people using Cryolators right now.
---
Title suggestions anyone? I go first LOL: The Impostor from Hell
---
76,000 hours next.
---
Love your pictures BTW
---
Depends on the prices. I will buy ALL your shit for scrip if you aren't trying to sell it for silly money. A lot of people price themselves out of the market massively even on mediocre stuff. 
---
I don't blame them as there's a lot of conflicting and bad info out there, and worth is different between people. But Fed76 is the biggest culprit. I used it a lot when I first found it but it's honestly not grounded in reality for a lot of stuff. Even at half price on a lot of stuff it's still way over for me. 
---
Armour is also an issue. I'm still seeing shitty unyielding armour for 3k a piece. I understand it's power (especially for the STAT bonuses for the run now) as I use it, but it's really not difficult to find in bad iterations. I geared up my 3rd toon with a full mismatched set of it in like two play sessions, and once the grind is over you can roll for it in SS endlessly or take your time finding better armour versions later for cheap when you have the SPECIAL bonuses going  already. I Sell mine for like 2-300 caps. 
---
I sell good ammo in bulk, earn caps, use it to buy scrip stuff or search for actual good weapons, then rinse and repeat. But I'm also perfectly happy letting a 3* furious Chinese officer sword stay in your vendor for 1500 caps.
---
Your shop sounds very appealing. What platform? Xd
---
You had me until you mentioned actually selling plans. I can't give those things away.
---
Don‚Äôt threaten me with a good time.
---
The game would break for good. lol
---
Xbox
---
Ok
---
*insert the load*
---
Dang :( I ps
---
Go to hell.
---
That's pretty pathetic really.
---
If that's how we get a Sharingan Sheepsquatch I'm all for it.
---
it'll only tell you if it'll put you over the max scrip amount, but it won't let you trade in a 5 scrip item if the machine only has 4 scrip left in it. and for me it's not so much about the 1 scrip, it's more about having to lug around the rather worthless legendary for another day till it resets. 
---
not saying it's the end of the world, but it is a pretty unrefined system to have implemented.
---
Yeah... I dont' put all the "Pocketed Leather" and other plans that everyone always has ... I'm choosey and only put things I think people want... it's probably why all 4 machines run around 50-75% capacity, because I have such high churn.
---
Yup
---
Nice one!
---
There was a massive dupe wave a little bit ago and unless you're selling god rolls, most end-game players are going to trading groups and trading there
---
yeah :(  it'll be great when the day comes that it is about the game and not the platform.
---
wait what? i thought they fixed that ages ago
---
well i know what im doing when that quest comes around for my alt
---
Your name says it, you inspired me to up my game photography skills üòÅ
---
If they put out a map that‚Äôs all bushes and deep woods, that could be hilariously fun. ‚ÄúBush Wookiee‚Äôs Revenge‚Äù, switchblades only and Ghillie suits for everyone.
---
Yea you do have a point. Idk I just wish there was a way to get the exclusive items without having to buy the entire bundle but I suppose that's kinda the point, huh.
---
Im a fan of being given one items that was sold a year ago that was worth like 300 atoms, like I know they dont want to give away the meaty content for free but something to keep us interested would be great. The Atom Store still leaves a bad taste in my mouth despite Atoms being much easier and items much cheaper now.
---
Lol Maybe is a way to make all dupers to empty their inventories?
---
Hmm.. that‚Äôs interesting. But who knows if they hadn‚Äôt already been doing a bunch of duping and stuff.
---
Yep, this is me. I don't even care about the rewards, I just feel embarrassed if I show up at a public event and don't play the objectives to the best of my ability. I did Rad Rumble last night, told people I'd keep the NPCs healed if they give me a shout when their health is getting low, and then ran for the ore as soon as the countdown hit 0. They let two of the NPCs die before I even finished getting the first 10 ore. We managed to keep the other two alive until the end but I'm pretty sure I collected all but 3 or 4 ore, because we ended at 43 and I cleared all 4 caverns. After that I just sat on top of the rad shower hut and killed ghouls with everyone else, and for once I didn't feel bad for doing it.
---
These are all fantastic. Especially love the ones of the Responders and Taggerdy‚Äôs Thunder. There‚Äôs something completely nostalgic in their faces, the hope of something better or sense of purpose. The artists did a great job.
---
Too much ammo wasted on the Queen.
---
Both glitches became public around the same time but then a lot of non dupers got caught up in that too!
---
Because we are addicted and adictol doesn't exist irl
---
I have a feeling it is to force you to look at the store, there is a reason we are met with an Atom Shop message every single time we start the game, it is to tempt you.
---
I use an asterisk myself!
---
And an Asterisk and a number if I need to organise them further.
---
Haha what? This is the only mission I haven‚Äôt completed. I solo everything, and soloing the nukes was significantly easier than doing project paradise. Can never seem to get an event group for it either. 
---
Bubba the glowing bloatfly? Why?
---
Definitely looking forward to some BOS content.
---
Are you using the future tech camp skin that was included with the season one of the legendary run?
---
If you do the miner miracles quest you can make your own
---
I'm man enough to admit I was going to steal his turds. Guess it was people like me he wanted to sock it to. :P

Oh god is it really something as stupid as that?

Too poor :(

Guess it's time to empty all those scrap boxes

Pmed appreciate it!

Top of gully mine, down the hill north to the junkyard workshop. Also the monorail elevation up the hill on the left look for the concrete foundation...then a skeleton sitting in a chair with 4-8 firecaps in a basket next to him.

the tagardy's thunder picture is actually ingame as a photo on tagardy's desk at fort defiance

i currently have it in my photo gallery

Did you see anything pop up saying you were attacked.  Did you see anything pop up to get revenge?    If not you weren‚Äôt killed by another player.    I am close to level 600 and I rarely die.    Every now and again I will get shredded at the end.    90% of the time it is a mire lark queen halfway across the map doing that acid attack.     It pisses me off to no end.   But does happen.
---
But what's the point? They literally unbanned those cheaters, most of them without even an inventory or character wipe. They're just going to dupe more of it. It's like trying to fix a leaky faucet with paper towels
---
The only heavy weapons that are not affected by the heavy weapons perks are missile launcher, grenade launcher, fat man and auto grenade launcher. If under normal (non legendary) circumstances the gun is not supposed to explode then it will work with heavy gunner.
---
&gt;\[..\] a large mob of scorched generally come running in a few seconds after queen goes down, those spawns can kill a lot of newer players who dont expect a cave crawler to be hiding in the SBQ body. If this sounds like what happened, \[..\]
---
It really sounds like this is what happened here. At least, this is what happened to me too today at my last SBQ fight.
---
The Queen had just been downed and was surrounded by at least 6 - 8 players, myself included, when a Mirelurk King must have spawned directly in the middle of our group. I only got a glance at it and heard the distinctive attack animation .. I didn't even notice the drop of my health bar -- I was just instant dead. And it must have killed at least one other player too, because we both respawned at the same time (both wearing PA).
---
easier to fill up the troughs to get a stronger friendly animal with more than 4 people. I really like pp. wish more folks would play along.
---
How about that Bonus for FO1st? They can‚Äôt even hid the fact they don‚Äôt give a shit anymore. Glad my 1st ran out this month. Better yet let‚Äôs get another week of spring and super hero‚Äôs. What a joke
---
You are an actual life saver my friend I owe you big time. If you are ever on the lookout for any weapon type I would be glad to help out
---
LOL I'll figure out how to share them to myself from my Xbox. I might have deleted the photo with the scorchbeast in play but I definitely have the other two duking it out.
---
The scorchbeast photo i has was basically just a blurry shot of the wing covering most of the other 2 lol
---
It was before my time in the game, but wasn‚Äôt there a whole dungeon-styled Vault that they‚Äôve completely scrapped? I don‚Äôt know what the sizing was like, but maybe they could utilize that. Or give us a more ‚Äúmodern‚Äù and decrepit version of Vault 51, it would encourage people to rank up more to find lore in the rooms and not just stand around in the lobby, and try to find good hiding/defensive spots for the round.
---
Sadly yes, using that skin seems to make it so fast travel points for your camp doesn't appear. The usual reason being "it's a bug"
---
I hate to break it to you man but, Fallout 76 is pretty unrefined. ü§£
---
There comes a point where these ‚Äúbugs‚Äù almost become willful intent 
---
They just don‚Äôt test the most basic things which doesn‚Äôt make sense
---
It just means someone recently cleared it and they haven‚Äôt respawned yet. The corpses glitch out sometimes from energy weapons, but now they fix themselves after a little while instead of being permanently glitched like they used to.
---
Keep after it.   You can cut another 10-15 min off that time.
---
met my boy x6-88 in the wayward, missed that dude.
---
1 Atom for 1 kill
---
Darkstar radio and that public radio mod from fallout 4 were excellent.
---
Downvoting since it bothers you to be downdooted
---
A lot of seasons items are currently broken. The future tech camp skin is one of them.
---
The cosmos power armor suit is missing the helmet
---
The gatling gun skin is bugged
---
I think the secret service ghillie skin is also bugged
---
The secret service underarmor skin in the atomic shop is bugged
---
The red rocket garage door from the atomic shop is bugged
---
The handmade skin from the seasons is bugged like the gold skin they sold in the atomic shop
---
The fire fly lamp could be bugged cause it's not producing light or not enough. 
---
I think I saw a post about the secret door fireplace also being bugged.
---
It was his first op outta the institute lol
---
And this sub will find a way to hate that
---
Un neccessary, glad it helps.
---
For less reliable drops most farms in the north west of the map have a few sporadic drops.
---
I've noticed doing leader of the pack,  when you arrive at the amusement park and run towards the closest wolves to the south, I'll find a fire cap. Then the last wolf is at that northern farm. When you fast travel there that spawn point has a firecap right there as well.
---
Not near the game for the farm name, but it's almost always the same one.
---
So not only do you get 3 legendaries for script, your getting precious fire cap. I'll do leader of the pack if its active while doing my standard run.
---
It's because they are not initially hostile to you they targeting to bots so they are neutral to you.
---
I fortunately am having no bad luck with the fireplace but that other light thing they gave doesnt work
---
Found the carry weight mod at the vendor in Watoga. The one in the Super duper Mart....not the train station.
---
I consider them a part of the event because you still have to go past them to get the supply crates
---
It isn't your PC its the game because even Fallout 4 was very poorly optimized. If you can play something like Warzone or Apex with max settings and never below 60fps, then you know it's the game and not your pc.
---
The return of fisto?
---
Personally, I'd prefer and Eyebot. I need Appalachian ED-E.
---
Yes I did something a banner at the bottom in red. I promise I am not making stuff up. My husband witnessed it and was scratching his head after it happened. He is a level 197 and I am 151. Not our first rodeo. He has played all of the fallout series, and I only have experience with this one. All the creature had been killed it was literally over. I do not loot the queen until all of the creatures are down.
---
Yeah I think you do however right now I just want the collection on display :D
---
I just got it last night so its still available, but not much longer.  You need something like 16000 XP in NW to get it
---
I had to build one. So, it's at like 160% condition. I'll just go to Flatwoods and beat everything up, I guess.
---
Ditto
---
There's still a market for good heavy weapons. As powerful as the gauss minigun is in the many various guises it has, it rips through ammo like it's going out of fashion. Priming it will get more mileage per craft, roughly tripling your running time, but it still finds itself impractical for general full time/day to day use compared to say a minigun. 
---
The 50 cal in particular remains very popular, with the one awarded by Beckett being a very good, solid choice. I rock that and I picked up a 3 star Vampire's minigun tonight that I'm going to pair it with.
---
When the legendary perks arrive and the ammo craft boost one is factored in that may change a bit, we'll have to wait and see.
---
I (used to) play ESO a lot, and personally love the useless pets. It's especially fun to see a ton of people being followed around by all manner of critters and mechanica. I would like pets that serve a purpose, but I'd be fine with a virtually identical implementation to ESO pets
---
*see a banner at the bottom in red.
---
Thats what I meant, your plan is perfect. Grenade for tagging and ready
---
?
---
on another note, fallout 76 needs a companion feature like fallout 4 :(
---
So I'm a PA build, so I use. The t65 for any actual combat experience.   For day to day stuff though, I use excavator, which lacks in the defense department.   So 2hen I go in with excavator, thinking I'm in t65, it ends quickly in the ISS favor.  And switching powere armors mid vent is even less recommended as i do not wear anything under the pa.
---
If you plan on going for SS armor, go for it.  But dont hold off grinding Encryptid for the SS armor.  Just do both.  Though I will say that I used to use X01 and was perfectly fine in the event.  So in a pinch, X01 may be suitable for you to gain defensive stats if you lack special made armor.
---
&gt;The fire fly lamp could be bugged cause it's not producing light or not enough.
---
Heh, the one item that is *supposed* to be ‚Äòbugged‚Äô...
---
Thanks! This worked. I was so frustrated!!

Anytime a deathclaw launches it's head after I shoot it off. Doesn't happen often but always makes me chuckle it's like welp I won't be needing this anymore yeeet!
---
Agreed. Absolute ghost Town.

I love how grungy the forest looks. wish it would've been more like that than how it is now
---
"demonic sheepsquatch" sounded like it would look... cooler than this
---
Still looking if anyone can help.
---
Personally I use a 1 star Bloodied Gattling Gun for day to day heavy gun use as I can one shot everything but bosses with it, but plan on phasing it out for a Bloodied Plasma Caster when I can due to it being more accurate and less vats coat. I only bring out the Gauss Minigun on the Scorchbeast Queen!
---
Not played with an LMG or a 50 cal due to never having enough ammo of either to be worthwhile. Nor having a bloodied variety of either.
---
Before the gauss minigun I used a Plasma Caster, which while fun isn't the most effective, plenty of ammo around for it though.
---
Will be crazy especially if a new dupe glitch is discovered
---
I've experienced that many times too lmao
---
But then how will I get all that glory and praise for submitting fluids?
---
I agree but idk how well the game would run if that was implemented
---
you have to be a new player to get them? how does that work?
---
I'd like to see one set in the Cranberry Bog, including a sundew grove or 2. Before we get another NW map, however, I think that we need to get Survival back. I only tried that mode out a few times towards the end of its life, but I loved it. It was nice to play with increased difficulty and a reason to engage in PvP or avoid other players, and then jump back over to Adventure for a break.
---
If you received SCORE ponts, you are good.
---
People just use it as 8 minutes of legendaries and XP farming, it hurts my soul when I am getting the Ore and I see "Legendary Enemy Has Mutated" feels like I am doing it for nothing.
---
What I read was the fireplace isn't completely fleshed up against the wall when you open it. Like there's a gap where the hinges are.
---
It gave the message, but I don‚Äôt know how much I had before and after
---
I sell camp plans at 25, fasnacht plans at 50 since I still have quite a few of them and any other known plans/recipes I drop in the overseers camp stash box. I was trying to sell plans for awhile...then they just kept piling up and i lost track of my inventory. When i got to a point where i just said eff it, and took out all plans and recipes. I had over 150 carry weight (is it lbs or kg?) worth of just known plans. Thats why I just give them away to new players now.
---
Events like these are WHY Dupe glitches are sought out tbh.
---
If the game was any kind of balanced, there wouldn't be tons of videos on how to do glitches on Youtube.
---
That about right.   Been awhile for me but that seams correct.    The only other thing I can come up with is that when you loaded in the game the pacifist flag did not take and you were not protected.     This would be the first I would of heard of this but with this game it‚Äôs not impossible.    
---
If this has only happened once then I would let it go and continue to enjoy the game.   You didn‚Äôt loose anything but junk.  They did fix the flux stealing thing.
---
Well it doesn't bother me, i just wasn't sure if it was the artwork or the fact it's an image, which I was told about in a previous thread, if that makes sense
---
How many times can we pull the string on the back of the doll till you grow out of it? Instead of a slot machine everything is a doll with a pull string with terrible, terrible odds in 76.
---
Now that you mention it I was able to place a door inside the frame when I left the fireplace open and was building
---
My biggest mistake is blowing 60 dolans to get it when it first came out
---
where is this located?
---
No, there's two different bugs. One where it will complete at 3/5 objectives completed, you still get the score points that way. And the other that a lot of us have been getting, the objectives are all complete and you do not gain any score for it. I've lost about 26k points, currently sitting at rank 83, if I didn't spend a lot of time grinding that 26k would really hurt.
---
If you get the message, you are good. The auto complete is when you first log in for the day and the challenges are already completed.
---
Goddamit no! I only just got the perk!
---
Somehow, this has yet to happen to me. I heard it‚Äôs mostly on PC - is this true?
---
Events and money just two major reasons of duping. I wouldn't be surprised if the goals are done fast thanks to dupers
---
I'd be satisified if the pets don't end up breaking the entire game.
---
How does this work exactly, do you have to participate in it to get the rewards?
---
Scrapping a Tattered Field Jacket instead of the trapper arm I was trying for.... üòì
---
I bout the vault tech bundle thinking it would give me plans for a water purifier and other useful things. Guess it was just a skin and still needed to find the plans.
---
I think its for the Camp item, the one from the run. I hope is that, try disabling it
---
Game is just a place holder for the count down timers for scrip, bullion and atoms.
---
But muh cork!
---
I need it to survive!
---
Not knowing mutations were OP first time playing.
---
That whole perk is toxic.
---
Hey I‚Äôll take Sanjay any day!

That's the point
---
Not knowing that some outfits are rare etc and scrapping or selling outfits to vendor bots, till I was level 202.
---
Should just be a standard jump height for everyone. Just helps higher levels feel like their progressing more at the game mode. I have it, but don't spam it. Plenty of nukes I wouldn't have ran from if I couldn't border hop a wall real quack.

Cork and maaaybe concrete are the only ones that strike me as remotely rare thy could be cleaned out. Steel? Steel is everywhere.
---
Yea it turned out to be the camp skin
---
You‚Äôd think that would be something they‚Äôd have tested
---
Bro if anything this is great for the junk economy. It inspires dupers/junk hoarders to remove their inventory for the good of the community!
---
Has nothing to do with explosive rounds, I went on a hardcore grind for the perfect Enclave Plasma Rifle. The event drops mods and fully modded Rifles. The event is bugged, the assaultron just goes hostile as soon as its hit by anything, even the enemy. But at the end all the robots will turn hostile on that assaultron and kill it, its pretty funny to watch.

Raider and Settlers bundles at full price--dropped like 50% a week later.....
---
I don't have a direct answer. Would going the other way be acceptable?like if her steam account is available now and she linked from Bethesda to steam instead of you linking from steam to Bethesda?
---
If you're just trying to friends each other enough to meet up in game, I'm pretty sure you can control+tab and just type in her Bethesda.net nickname. At least that's what I found searching the internet.
---
if you're trying to get the whole steam voice layer thing to work that may not be as easy without actually doing the launcher thing you're looking to do now.
---
Out of curiosity I would like to know what are all the exclusive items in every bundle, is there a list or something?
---
Im curious about the bundles I have.
---
You do know you get the rewards no matter who delivers the materials yeah? So if someone wants to go find all the cork in the game (somehow) and then mark it up and then someone wants to buy it why are you bothered?
---
Don't buy it, if you don't make it yourself in the quest, the game glitches out and you'll never be able to craft a set again due to a game breaking glitch they've never fixed.
---
^This is the right way to do it. 
---
Believe it or not I am actually anti-hoarder. I just don‚Äôt want to devote the time to sell trade etc. because I also just like playing the game.
---
You do realize that whether or not an open world spawn point has an item is also dependent on your running loot history, right?
---
And none of those are rare. 
---
Use [this guide](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic) and you‚Äôll have plenty of everything you need.
---
Yep that's like 4 dupers worth of mats xD
---
I wonder if this is meant to be sort of a "clean up the streets" thing. You know, to get duped materials out of circulation, no questions asked.
---
You seriously think people wouldn't cheat if the game was balanced? Whatever your definition of balanced is, I promise you, people would still dupe.
---
It's across all platforms, it's related to the bug with challenges auto completing because of NW. NW triggers it and being online when the daily challenges reset can trigger it. Server crashes have also triggered it.
---
Nuclear Winter was never actually intended, it was created to replace their more hardcore PVP version of the game due to the mass amount of casuals who play the game. I'd much prefer survival mode come back and Nuclear Winter get axed
---
  200,000,000 Cork 
---
150,000,000 Plastic 
---
I just don't see this happening?
---
Huh. I guess I‚Äôve been lucky because I always do the NW stuff last, and am never online when it resets.
---
If mutations are around I predict low hp would still be meta due to adrenal reaction stacking with nerd rage, except now it'll probably be PA users with emergency protocols instead of unyielding. 
---
Still creates that issue.
---
I did some extra research and they did have a means to do it up until April 28th I think. But they pointed out that Atoms and purchases would not transfer if you changed platforms, so you probably don't want to do that.
---
Better just to do the friends link up. if you want to chat and stuff you'll just have to do that through a game after you team up which is actually quite convenient and seems to work we're out there well. At least on console.
---
I mean, resources in a location will respaen if ya  just jump servers so it's not a big deal. Resources really aren't scarce you just have to take the time go around a look. If you pick up everything little thing, you'd be surprised at how much scrap you get
---
I notice the "pick wild plants" challenge works fine with the crops in your camp lol.
---
I have to admit that I wanted to build under that stones archway abovr, but I ended up not being able to get the acid spot.  Feels bad...
---
Bro.. me too. But I mean, I have played 200 hours in 80$ game so I got my worth out of it. And I still haven't done all the quests and stuff
---
Bad crowd maybe? Most people rush 90 ores to spawn deathclaws and floaters those give a truck ton of xp. I‚Äôve not been to a failed event so far.
---
Oh great, cork duping. Thanks, 2020.
---
Nice, looks like a gimp suit
---
Yea something like that. I don't have it yet so I don't know the specifics, just picked up on lots of posts here and just remembered that they had issues with a ton of end game score items and a lot of atomic shop items recently added were bugged thanks to some peeps looking out for others not wasting their precious atoms.
---
honestly most if it you can get as loot from enemies or in containers, or even taking workshops. think the hardest will be cork or concrete except...fucking *plastic*.
---
why would they do plastic. i cannot even fathom who thought plastic was a good idea.
---
it's never buyable in bulk. the farm spots are almost always wiped out. there's no workshops that produce it. no way to craft it. 
---
why not adhesive or aluminum? why not ANYTHING else? jfc i'd take screws over plastic. there's just no way we'll meet the plastic mark when it takes TEN to make shotgun shells.
---
It would be an empty game, because most everyone would quit.
---
I feel that this... relationship... which you are attempting to... foster... is perhaps inappropriate on some level. However, as I exist to serve the... desires... of members, I confess a certain level of... intrigue... with your suggestion.
---
Strange story. Why were you not in pacifist? And two others? If you are at the SBQ I would think you know about it by then or you must have had a miserable time getting there. The odds of three (two others killed) of you being equally dopey is mind boggling. The flux stealing was a problem way back in Beta, so Beth made it so if you die you dont drop flux, it simply disappears. No vig in killing everyone after the event that way. 
---
Did you write this in 2018 and just post it now?
---
Griefers at the SBQ NOW simply kill the queen in less than a minute - usually using a hacked weapon they got from a duper - depriving everyone else of loot because they have very small penises.
---
No one really knows, but probably not
---
I'd REALLY REALLY miss my 2 shot MIRV and two shot AGL.
---
One of the things I did as a low level was trying to ride a vertibird; hard but I could make it. Just to get spitted out like when you jump on the automatic misile launcher from line of the sand for example. It was disappointing because I was not expecting to get in, but why dont let the players stay on top on the vertibird; at their own risk haha
---
You need to do a certain amount of damage to be able to get loot from it. I believe you need to deal 1k damage at least.
---
I would say yes except it is 90% of the time I am the only one getting ore and I am trying save the scavs from dying. The event fails more often than not.
---
Even those aren‚Äôt really rare. Concrete bags yield 7 each, and there are a lot of places you can find 8-10 at a time. Cork you get from Golf Balls, Baseballs and Globes.
---
How about no. If you suck at NW, you suck. Let me guess you don‚Äôt play NW but you wanna change it?
---
Run as soon as you spawn, otherwise you have to move your camp.
---
If you can predict which foundations it happens, you could try placing chairs that you can interact with to get out from!
---
Ok, that explains a lot, seeing as my two shot .44 only does ~14 dmg with both projectiles combined per shot
---
PM your gamertag and I can just give you a bunch. I'm hoping to get back on soon, but we're getting a storm and the power keeps going out!
---
it is all about farming xp right now. just accept the reality.
---
If it‚Äôs like the last community event, I don‚Äôt think so. But these components are so easy to find and so plentiful, everyone should be able to contribute. 
---
I mean, it‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre asking for 100,000,000 Screws.
---
We need companions like fallout 4, not just lazy bums that sit at our camps.
---
So you found that out as you were going to steal his turds? Shame!
---
Luck 10
---
Bethesda can't even have their glitches work right. smh
---
Wait, you can steal collectrons?! Well shit, I better put Becky away.
---
Yes dump frog legs! This close range jumping up and down with a gauss shotgun is the most gimmicky shit ever
---
If you or someone else play the game on a different PlayStation account on your console, it unequips all atom shop items you own!
---
Did it for shits and giggles and it really fucked with it my old camp. Not worth it on two fronts, one you could get banned for it(which i think it‚Äôs programmed the same way as the raider one to be honest) and you can not move the ammo factory when you put it down. It was really more of a hassle then it was worth.
---
What everyone else said is correct. In addition to that if you use the explosives perk it adds to the damage total.
---
Bring out the Gimpsquatch.
---
But the GImpsquatch is sleeping...?
---
Guess you‚Äôre gonna have to wake him up.
---
Damn that‚Äôs unfortunate, if you‚Äôre on pc I would‚Äôve add you then at least there will be 2 of us running for ores haha
---
Honestly, Watoga and the surrounding area would be amazing!
---
To paraphrase Mr. Smith from "The Matrix" - "the early worlds were too perfect, humans would not accept the programming. Whole populations were lost".
---
In a nuke zone, you'll see mutated versions of regular flowers. Look for red ones.
---
Did they ask for a screenshot?
---
ALL HAIL, THE SHEEPSQUATCH!!!
---
Level 110, met some good friends through the mode, unlocked every item through different challenges, user of the perk myself (not because I want to, but not using it is such a stupid disatvantage) my adventure mode main characters special points is attributed more for NW than for adventure 
---
I did not intend for this post  to attract snarky comments, if you think it should stay then say why instead of coming forth as an ignorant prick.
---
Thanks alot my guy
---
thanks bro
---
I put forward a ticket for that, turns out they changed the icon for it in the emote list in the atom shop.
---
tyy
---
PS4 :(
---
I'm surprised anybody likes fo76 enough to commit to that.
---
I'm not a fan of the Enclave, but I am absolutely a fan of this idea
---
Hah, lets not put it as a priority just yet then! ;) (in the future however...)
---
Dattebayo it is.
---
Glad Im not alone feeling this way
---
Upgrades gentlemen, upgrades.
---
My name here is the same in game.  West coast NA. Ive had alot of luck using the area chat to meet new folks at events. The groups help but even some lower levels are just high level folks on new toons grinding score lol.
---
I would uninstall and go play a game that didn‚Äôt wipe my progress for no reason
---
Agree haha Im glad to help
---
Knowing this I havent even tried the camp item, and I like it a lot. Hope they fix it soon; how many bugs can we reach? Maybe its all an experiment.
---
Say it loud, say it proud
---
It's on the left side of the runway if facing north on the side of one of the metal huts if I remember correctly.
---
Could be due to sustainability. 
---
Paper money is easy to get destroyed and printing it again is not easy when there is no bank doing it and running the machine to replace old destroyed paper money.
---
Then something must be done about the mass duped weapons, perhaps they will in time.  Or they just do not see it as a major issue.
---
Either way I just hope those of us with legitimate legacy weapons are not left shit out of luck if they do come up with a solution.
---
That is fantastic!
---
I did sneak with an instigating weapon for quite a bit.  You oneshot most mobs but bosses are a little more rough.  So for them pick up a furious weapon.
---
You also could do Junkies if you wanted.
---
Just looks like they painted it black...
---
It's a metal item that won't really be made in mass anymore. It can also survive the harsh environment better than paper money. Also a good chunk of pre war money most likely got destroyed. It's also a light item that can easily be carried. There's other reason and what not but I don't feel like looking it up lol
---
I have only got 5 points in that special so I can't use it and I feel like I've lost more games due to that perk than actual skill
---
Yep, I travelled to a mole rat horde event in the savage divide and got teleported inside the AMS building in Watoga.
---
I agree, we should be able to post pictures, I was surprised when I discovered it
---
It's kinda annoying bc that is the only thing my fiance does in the game literally...buy, sell, trade.. he hasn't even worked on the legendary run. That's why we don't actually play together besides to meet up when giving stuff to eachother. On the other hand, he's gotten me some great weapons for my build lol
---
ah ok cool thanks
---
Where were the spots
---
That creepy little freight train of death and destruction can stay in his little bunker thank you very much
---
I can confirm - no rewards for SBQ kill and event. Just want to post so whomever looks at this has data. I was using a Vampires gatling laser and Vampire effect stopped working during the event in case that has impact for the bug.
---
Pets. Ahh they sank so much time coming up with the system. But the programmer was hated by management so to defile his work they made it very hard to find a tameable animal back in 2018. They also made the animals very easy to kill so they had a short lifespan - to their credit, they were trying to give us the "true" pet experience of your pet dying. In 2019 they made it harder to find an animal, and mostly you found robots, inclusing the useless Messenger quest that used to roam the map. In 2020 they made it even harder by adding cultists and bloodeagles to the random spawns. 
---
It took me 3 hours of server hopping to find a level 16  yao guai. It lasted about that long in my camp.
---
Bethesda, why do you treat the work of your talented people with such disrespect by rendering it useless?
---
i think you mean nerf Bloodied
---
This is what it says about my Junkies Limb Damage Reduced Weight .50 cal

Some buyers could pay over 90,000

90K my ass. That site inflates prices becasue everyone see that "some" line and want to sell for no less than that.
---
One was near devil‚Äôs backbone, the other was kinda near Johnson‚Äôs acre
---
Yeah had to redo my special points to cater to the game mode, I mean it turned out okay as Im not running a super sweaty build but uts still points that could have gone elsewhere
---
I get smooth frames in my base, mostly bases in whitesprings get a strange fps drop
---
:( lol
---
Look up on youtube acid cave
---
I went to a guys base and was extremely confused when I heard way to many factories going at once, I went underground with his bass in the ground and there they were, an entire army of ammo factories, but hey, they were unlocked so free ammo!
---
got it, thanks!
---
It just needs to be gone or only cost like 2 points.
---
It use to get loads but it is next to a fissue thing but no scorched beasts has attacked ever, tbh i get no enemies attack my base
---
It is heavily decorated
---
Yeah pretty random
---
If the bomber jacket was over the officers suit I'd be happier but I like rocking mine every now and then
---
Was this just now? Could it have been the same event we did? Saw a lot of people run away from her body then run back like i did. Now i'm wondering if no one in my server got rewards.
---
I know which Id hope for, lol
---
None spawn tbh so my place is a peaceful area and with a good build i can handle them if i ever get an attaack
---
I can understand memes not desired, but art I would think would be a bit different
---
I definitely just did fish in a barrel...uh line in the sand and it still works. If your talking about adventure mode and I imagine your not. But I have no idea as I have never played NW but I didn't think there were events.
---
Deal! let me get some easy kills first
---
You're still low lv so it depends on how many pts you're moving. 5 or less? Stick with this guy. 
---
10 or more? Thats 25% of your levels. Make a new one.
---
Its much different when you are in the lv 100s. My lv 250 has 90 extra pts right now; for that character, I could respec to whatever if I wanted to
---
I traded my favorite gun for a circus trailer plan, which I then couldn't even place because it's enormous and still have never used üò≠üò≠ it was a 3* quad handmade and I loved it but figured I'd find something just as good to replace it. It's been 3 months... Still looking ‚òπÔ∏è
---
Oh well. Seems like it's faulty so you may as well go ahead and delete it and build something different instead.
---
Jangles/buttercup are my go to icons.
---
Thank you üòÅ there is many ways to decorate a base, look up some methods as there is plenty of methods, only limit to my base is budget
---
No - mine was much earlier today. I didn't think to mention it until I saw your post describing a similar experience that I had earlier today.
---
Thank you ‚ò∫Ô∏è i tried to fill up every inch of the walls and go for a tropical/natural theme
---
Oh and when I had just started, I bought the scavenger Collectron and the communist Collectron the same day because I thought I could use both üòÇ lesson learned
---
Thank you ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
A random dead scorchbeast fell out of the sky for some reason.
---
Epic stuff üëåüèª
---
If you must go at low levels... bring like 4k .38 ammo and just use them all! You just need to hit 1/4 shots to make the 1k damage :)
---
I don't know about not getting event rewards, but when I don't get loot from the queen it usually means it's time to switch servers, because there's a bug where you'll stop doing damage; Period.
---
I Googled after making my previous comment just to compare and contrast the Overseer's jacket with this one, which has a few differences. 
---
It would definitely be nicer if the outfits customization was a little more versatile, √† la *Grand Theft Auto: Online* or something, and be able to layer certain things, mix and match pants and shirts/coats, et cetera. But take what we can get, I suppose.
---
Welp, time to raid Watoga High School repeatedly
---
Yeah, I agree with this.
---
Solution! Delete all of them and stop using that bug!
---
Ah okay, well at least i'm not the only one and not just going crazy or something!
---
I also had some weird stuff going on.  My aa3325 auto 10mm was hitting in vats once every other clip on the grounded queen. And I‚Äôm not talking the normal miss miss hit.  I‚Äôm talking 20+ misses then a hit, then 20 more miss without ever leaving vats.
---
I got no credit and no loot for either.
---
Fortunately, they've added the plan for the Tenderizer to Meat Week rewards, meaning we don't have to set aside 20 pounds in our STASH *and* we can finally get legendary Tenderizers.
---
That makes sense! Her scorched spawn seemed to take no damage from me and their health would rubber band. My teammates had to wipe them out for me. I just assumed I was lagging.
---
It would be great if we had more freedom to mix and match.
---
Blindly making my build before I started reading and researching things. Honestly, the logic of perks, chems, combat, armor, legend Aries makes no goddamn sense unless you just know. This game would be a wreck if it did not have the internet hive mind at work to explain everything - even then, I find stuff here or on YouTube that‚Äôs never mentioned in the wikis. 
---
So, yeah, I picked up a lot of stupid dumb ass perks that make no sense now.
---
Lore: https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/%241_NCR
---
Spoiler: we, too, in this game try to introduce gold-backed economy
---
Junk. Fences.
---
Bring them in from Fallout 4. So much stuff they could just asset flip.
---
Maybe they were born in 1976 and they don't even play this game.
---
Comforting moo.
---
Good question. I‚Äôm not sure where the list would be (I‚Äôm sure it exists). A recent example is the train car in the diner bundle, or the greenhouse in that green thumb bundle, or the porch (I think) in the modern house bundle.
---
I remember having to learn that when I finally got the plans for shielded raider underarmor.
---
You can post art and pics to /r/fo76FilthyCasuals !
---
Sometimes you can get around it by switching from guns to melee, or using grenades.
---
new players are usually the last to get it
---
Tetanus?
---
It would be fuckin awful lol? I‚Äôd absolutely stop playing. I know how all the base weapons feel. Legendary effects are the e d game.
---
Funny you say that -  I have an elaborate base as well. Some people want to see the world burn I guess..
---
Fun fact! According to many posts on this Reddit, you can't delete them and they take up permanent portion of your budget, even if you move your camp and don't place them again. üôÇüôÇ Enjoy the ammo!
---
Not knowing what build to play. With no respec, I had to level up to change anything.
---
Swilliam93 is my GT if you need some help. I have like 100 of them lol
---
If you want to consistently play two vastly different types of characters, you should just have two characters.  I realized recently that I don't like my current play style and and transitioning to something else.  Because I don't plan on going back, I'm just going to use the same character.
---
Thank you!
---
This is actually a good idea
---
Different PC or same PC? 
---
I know that you can log in with steam version of the game with bethesda account. 
---
Copy and pasting from pc to pc is something you have experiment yourself. 
---
Save yourself the headache and just install it tbh.
---
Luck 35 with unyielding
---
https://imgur.com/iooIZFg
---
on that we can all agree my friend :)
---
What‚Äôs your GT
---
Same happened to me. I got the loot but no rewards.
---
üòâ
---
I'm excited for the new Collectron!
---
I may not have a huge surplus of things other than Wood, Cloth, Glass and Steel which I have a ridiculously high amount of just sitting and taking up space. I can't wait to unload it and start looting up more common scrap items rather than ignoring it as I don't need Steel and Cloth haha
---
Yeah. 
---
None of the junk for the rewards is particularly difficult to farm....
---
Plus, inhooe people dump it in large quantities. After the event I'll sell a ton of ammo crafting mats.
---
With heavy guns it is already pa and ep.
---
I wish they‚Äôd add a mode to it where it wasn‚Äôt one death like a TDM mode or workshop defense
---
Well, they aren't. You can run right past them and you will still pass the event. They never follow me out
---
I just mod a rolling pin x5 wood to chef, chef to wood.
---
With Hacker and PickLock 3, absolutely
---
Well today I fast travelled to the General's Steakhouse to catch Bone Worms from nothing.
---
What console/pc are you on?
---
There is such a thing. And feline leukemia.
---
You were in a team! A private team, not public, I presume? 
---
They were supposed to fix this in the current or next update, but if any one of your team members does NOT have pacifist on, and is shot at and returns fire, the whole team is now engaged with pvp with the offender. 
---
Can you confirm whether all team members had pacifist on? And yes, this is an issue (not a bug, more of a lingering hallmark of fallouts pvp trials in the past) but I had read in one of the ITVs that it will be fixed.
---
I changed my build at level 70ish by shuffling a lot of points around, it was not that big of a hurdle.  You still got special points to earn so it won‚Äôt hinder much at all post level 50.
---
Personally, I wouldn't restart a character for that. Even if it means having to get 10+ more levels to finish your new build.
---
Having to go through the quests you just did will be a pain in the ass and by the time you catch up to your old char's level, you could have grinded for xp and be done with it already.
---
On the other hand, if going back through the quests you just completed isn't a problem for you ... then that's up to you.
---
Different PC and alright I'll do that
---
Two Shot now appears to be doing +50% damage on the second shot: my rifleman build that used to be junkies now uses a TS lever action and it handily passes the ‚Äúkill a super mutant primal in one bullet‚Äù test.
---
I'm on Xbox
---
Well all know they‚Äôre just holding back on us, Fallout 4 we could have robots follow us around and companions I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Bethesda made us pay for this lmao i have reasonable doubt to believe we‚Äôd be able to unlock anything via quests
---
Where did you get the model from?
---
I have had 1st since the day it was offered and I only have 700 cork scrap because I don't use it/pick it up.
---
Accidentally deleting my first main character at lvl 86.
---
Why?
---
I have 1st myself.  My camp sits right on top of a junk node you can extract junk from non-stop along with my collectron.  I was slacking on collecting junk because I have a shit ton already but I guess its time to start back up.
---
Yeah.. so even though your guns won't say bloodied anymore, and you won't do as much damage, low hp will still be best in game
---
Check disk and defrag your PC, at least for the drive where you've got the game stored.
---
(Note that this also helps on the PS4.)
---
I'm not perfectly certain why this helps but I think there is some sort of time limits on the part of the software that preloads the textures and verifies the game client. I suspect it's an anti-tampering or anti-cheating measure.for whatever reason if the game image and resource files are spread all hither and yon The chances of a missed start seem to go up substantially.
---
I do this on my PS4 regularly after games get patched. You said you were using a laptop but I've made this suggestion to other PC users and it seems to work for them as well. And it also seems to work for several games not just fallout 76 etc.
---
Another thing that's just a really good idea is if you defrag your C drive lately going in and manually creating your swap file can also speed up game load times. Having a minimum size of the swap file of being the same as the amount of RAM you've got just cuts down on the disk head seeking and all that stuff.
---
I don't know why slow load becomes an abort for sure, but it seems to be true on all the platforms. Doing all the things we used to do to all the systems all the time that helped speed up load times tends to fix a lot of these issues semi magically.
---
Even if it doesn't work it won't hurt your system and could help for incidental reasons. Just start it up and walk away.
---
It's shitty sure but it's the opposite of dumb.
---
Specifically for Appalachia, the Whitesprings was running a promo for Nuka Cola before the bombs dropped, where the vendors there would accept Nuka Cola bottle caps in place of actual cash. This programming stuck around after the bombs dropped, and presumably spread across Appalachia from the Whitesprings, with factions programming their own vendor bots to accept caps. By the time Wastelanders rolls up and people return to Appalachia, folks have just accepted caps as currency and go with it. Add in the fact pre war money was hopelessly inflated before the war and near worthless anyways, and everyone in Appalachia basically mutually agrees to take caps.
---
I started carrying my cryo and am trying but she wont land and people wont get off the tents and fences!
---
Eh.  I would have tried to help you get something, but I play on pc.
---
Yup - same here. Shooting spawn and mirelurks and no damage. First time I had this issue.
---
Its a mega merge actually
---
Bethesda is creating a resource crisis
---
No worries personally made a pistol build and currently my 3 str character with unyielding set hits more then any pistol including black powder pistol. Didn't even make build right away on release in case perks got rebalanced, only used perk selection to lvl 10ish since I knew I was going to do things like lock pick and hacking skills but stopped till I grinded to lvl 100+  doing nothing but Monster Mash back when merely arriving would trigger quest almost everytime for a few months. Now I know best builds are Rifle, Heavy Weapons, and most OP in damage Melee.
---
Yep.
---
The only melees insta killing the SBQ are exploiters, and that is an entirely different topic.
---
how about you be grateful you get anything for free
---
Thanks anyway! üôÇ
---
Transferring items and losing them. Clicked adventure instead of private world.

Also selling a broken uny powered sent right leg to a vendor on accident and it disappeared.
---
Know someone who scrapped a glitched nw laser but I never f‚Äôd up that bad.
---
I would honestly welcome this but implemented in a different way. Like ‚Äúdry‚Äù events where all legendary effects were removed but with an incentive like double xp. I feel like it would be a nice break from the usual two shot and bloodied chaos that takes the thrill out of the medium to easy events for high level players.
---
Does your friend also like dropping Christmas gifts by the thousands?
---
Im sure he also just took a brief leave of absence from the game too and is suddenly back making ammo machines that usually exist in workshops.
---
I feel your pain I'm currently in the middle of sorting everything out and trying to respec
---
Amazing. Well done.
---
I scrapped several Quad FFR teslas.  I also sold a vampire's explosive harpoon gun for 5k the week before they announced they would be legacy weapons
---
I've seen confused newbies unloading into my pets and they never take any damage. My pets have all lasted multiple weeks and have died to monster spawns (which also wiped out my turrets so it obviously wasn't a player).
---
People need to start building camps where you can set up junk extractors.  Easy way to continually get junk while out and about.
---
Same issue, they mentioned in Reddit AMA that they were changing it but that was a while back and still no mention when it would be implemented.
---
That's the spot that if you place the camp right you can get a lead and acid extractor? 
---
Saw a video on it way back and he said he got attacked by scorchbeasts a bunch while building it.
---
Turned me off from the spot. Well... that and I'm a melee build so I don't really need the ammo. 
---
But hey, if you're safe it looks great and is in a great spot.
---
Not to mention the hardcore farmers likely have Fallout 1st anyways and would just farm Private Servers since a fresh server has fresh spawns everywhere
---
Finally my 2k steel can amount to something
---
This was the only one that I was not too thrilled about.  I use a shotgun build and Im always farming that shit.  Might get a little ugly when it comes to plastic.
---
So in short; programming of cap using vendors was the last thing in that area and the latest in documents for repeating it, before the bombs, and so a lot of the residents did and no one complained? 
---
Thats what it sounds like to me.
---
I made that place as home for ages nows and i haven‚Äôt had a single attack. I think the fissue site use to be open hence why loads of scorchbeasts attacked (it is now closed with rocks so none spawn nows), it is an amazing spot
---
Save some perks for level 27. I think it's 27. You'll need to save 2 for starched genes. After that you can get the healing factor mutation. You will be swimming in all you're extra stims. 
---
If you combine this with the sunkissed perk, you will always be full health and rad free.
---
Yeah how is this quality so good? You using a ps4 pro?
---
That's cool thanks might have to see if I can get one or two maybe three or four
---
Keep thinking they'll drop last-gen support once next gen is up, then kick off from there with everything at the ready, ie, no legacy weapon problem (it's a problem when you're one shotting event legendaries with no remorse)
---
Oh that's good to know. Any spot with a cave is pretty rockin, and an extractor to boot.
---
first time i had scaly skin i rushed too see my self
---
Ebay has em rather cheap
---
This is fair but he can also level smarter/faster (now that he's already experienced the story) by not doing quests and focusing on events! Buy the first cheap semi auto/auto explosive in a vendor that he finds and just tag stuff until desire perk layout is reached :)
---
I hear you man. I launch about 3 a day and I still get a thrill when I hear those klaxons go off
---
Yep.  You no longer need to grind killing Floaters to craft the Grenades.
---
Last time I gave that, I was overwhelmed with people wanting friend requests in order to join my world.  Also, would get people come and clear out my machines so they can try to flip for profit. I'm not about that. I do it hoestly, to make some guys day that was struggling to make progress.  Caps mean nothing. I daily grind the bullion/Legendary Run. Then I just Event  hop all day long. I help out low levels (sub 50) in between.  I do it for my addiction.  
---
Send me a private msg and I'll let you know.
---
Well that and all the buttsex
---
I‚Äôd be more than happy to bring that genocidal AI into my camp. I‚Äôm sure Athena and Daguerre would just love sharing a room with it.
---
Thanks I will take a look
---
yup common bug, or all the headless ghouls standing around. Lots of times I also find ghouls who wont wake up, you can kill them, but loot is only there for 1 sec max then loot box disappears. 
---
Sometimes I wonder how many interns and summer students had their chance at their code base.
---
Haha same.  No wonder my friends ask me if I have Steel.  I'm like "Bruh I got you fam."
---
Nice I was so confused because I never learned the plan
---
Judging by the theme of most posts on this sub Reddit, this person clearly isn‚Äôt a member.
---
I leave my extractors unlocked for people to access, I know it'll be full again when I return!
---
Okay I've been drunk for too long and somethings happened. This is *exactly* like the Corona toilet paper thing when suddenly people are insane...
---
WTF is going on and why are we hoarding resources?? (Given I've been hoarding since day 1 and have stupid levels in the stash box...). Who is this Atlas and why does he want my shit?
---
Yeah I got given one for doing the event today, not a plan, just the weapon!
---
When I was new to the game, I thought everyone would see it lmao. I called for help every time and was butthurt no one responded. Were they lower levels?
---
Are you the Mysterious Stranger?
---
Equip another weapon and it will work. Just another bug to add to the list of "just broke it, don't bother fixing anytime soon"
---
I shall leave this here to explain 
---
https://youtu.be/rFt3ErEfDxI
---
I'd want a liberator pet, little tiny tinker-bot following me spouting chinese curse words at enemies as it tries (poorly) to hit them with its lasers would be a nice source of laughs for me. The way they fall over when you hit them always makes me giggle.
---
not much of a spoiler if you don't mark it as such.
---
My question is always HOW???? ü§£
---
Wait it‚Äôs a bug? Are you serious??? Wow I‚Äôm pissed
---
I'd want a sentry bot even if it didn't shoot anything, they look cool. One of my fave enemies in fallout 3/4/nv/76 is those.
---
The Brotherhood of Steel is coming to Appalachia.   
---
They're taking over ATLAS, a weather research and control site in the Savage Divide.  
---
They need supplies to get things situated as they've walked all the way here from Nevada, so we're being kind neighbours and giving them our extra junk in exchange for fancy plans and other things.
---
even us non science nerds want a liberator or eyebot to follow us, pretty weird gatekeeping
---
Now serving 1001
---
I'd want one of those 3 headed possoms in my camp just because. If I can choose where it sits i'll make it a chair and doll it all up LOL.
---
why? they're just low effort reskins
---
I do find them cute robot enemies, they try SO hard, and fall on their asses more often than not.
---
Fallout new vegas an 3 explains the reason why. It had something to do with how popular the drink was. Everyone drank it and loved it. The people who survived the bombs were a tad nostalgic before the nuclear winter came an destroyed their world. So they decided to start trading with their favorite drinks bottle caps. Bottle caps also didn't get destroyed as easily as paper money and paper money lost all its weight in value after the fall of the US government. Sasprilla was the 2nd most popular drink but it was only on the west coast and its also used a currency but has less value of a Nuka cola bottle cap.
---
I hate when they don‚Äôt even charge their laser beams. Just an automatic shot on you, and you‚Äôre melted.
---
They are horridly implemented though. Next to no splash damage and I swear take a day to detonate. You basically have to place one in an enemies pocket for them to be effective.
---
lovely, he deleted the post from getting hate on using an unintentional bug
---
Yes they stack. But a full set of SS plus mutations is more than enough DR and ER so running Vanguard is alot of diminishing returns. 
---
For tankiness you want damage reduction pieces like hunter, exterminator, etc. You only get 5, so choose which things usually kill you most and defend against those.
---
Fantastic summary üëè
---
MOO
---
I was fighting the SBQ and she just appeared
---
I literally just drop them they suck and I‚Äôm glad I never spent gold on the plans. Only plans I spent gold on is secret service armor. Didn‚Äôt buy under armor until they added the shielded mods to it. Guass shotgun guass mini plasma caster and guass pistol. And just purchased the t65. I would‚Äôve been mad to spend all that time grinding gold to buy those nades then everyone gets them
---
I didn‚Äôt know it was a glitch ;-;
---
Using a jetpack and springboard trap you can fly across the entire map. Been doing this daily for a few months to learn the region from the air. Looks great from up there.
---
I got 2k steel from a line in the sand run where i hit most of the mobs and scrapped everything. I use it up fast as I like building and shooting my own bullets so it seems like every week I spend easily 1k in steel on bullets and misc building.
---
Yeah wish they were better
---
I literally just tell my friends to use mine cause of this. And they just don't wanna. Should I forward then this l?
---
I would be happy even if we didn‚Äôt control it but paid caps to fly from the current destination to the fast travel location. It would be cool to travel like this in power armor and if you see low levels fighting enemies below drop in like an Orbital strike and rain death.
---
Nice math and cheers for taking the time.
---
I imagine with additional rewards (potential for rare plans) being tied to donations of materials we will see the user base contribute well above the minimum daily requirement.
---
That is of course assuming that these rare plans are something new and not just another run at existing plans.
---
I'm looking forward to seeing the results of a data mine come the patch to see whats up for grabs. For me at least it will be the decider on how much effort I put into this.
---
You guys on this forum take this stuff way too seriously. It‚Äôs a video game, you‚Äôre acting like this dude committed a crime üòÇ
---
They should be better but why would cool grenades have actual value
---
If you're on PS4 could I potentially buy a load of camp and Fasnacht plans from you?
---
I think the BOS are super lame and have no interest in earning these rewards.
---
And when is Bloodied builds are gone, and you don‚Äôt have your heavy hitters anymore, I better not catch you bitching about how much harder everything is now because it‚Äôs too bullet spongy.
---
I just unlocked it 4 hours ago. I wasn't happy at all
---
I want a Colonel Gutsy!
---
Respect the Squatch.
---
Nah - they need to do a massive bug fix release and kick cheaters.
---
Hmmm
---
I wouldn‚Äôt be so sure about that. My build isn‚Äôt even finished yet, I still need to install another 15-20 levels worth of work. I‚Äôm already putting out 9k damage a hit on the Queen. Goes up to 15k with the right food, drink, chems, mags and bobble heads.
---
I have the opposite experience - I call for help 8f I see 1 or 2 players around and they come over and wait for me to drop to see what goodies I leave behind.
---
Can't blame them ü§£
---
In the end that's up to him/her. I personally wouldn't only because I find going through quests I did recently super boring since you already know the outcomes. 
---
If you're suggesting he/she should re-do a char to skip the quests and grind for exp, why re-do a char in the first place? And let's not forget about everything he/she collected so far and all the plans learned already.
---
Like someone else said, it's better to re-do a char only if you intend on using multiple builds.
---
Don't the servers recycle quite frequently ???
---
I want a pet Liberty Prime to say "Communism detected on American Soil, lethal force engaged"
---
Hey congrats - finally nabbed my first today also
---
Liberator!!! Smells like communism to me!
---
Keep in mind it's very likely a bug. The plan can still be purchased with gold, and they still can not be sold to vendors/traded to players. They are also still not affected by explosive/weapon weight reduction
---

Lol sorry man you didn't miss anything. Go get another key card and you can do it again

That would be an anachronism, though.

Unless she can wear piper's outfits, then we can pretend she arrived from the future.

Hopefully not arson
---
Oh my fucking god he dropped me 50! I didn‚Äôt know he was a glicher! I‚Äôm very new to the game and I didn‚Äôt know that‚Äôs why it was like that
---
Yeah, but if you're going to be trashing stuff anyway, may at least take a small chance of others getting it. Same idea as legendaries in suitcases
---
Fair enough
---
How about instead of pets they fix the fucking game.
---
That is true for the community rewards. However, it also said that every time you turn in scrap, you have to potential to get a 'rare plan'. They did not specify what those plans are. 
---
So, I think that this is what people are mainly worried about.
---
I don't think we have to worry about the resources, since they unbanned all those dupers there are going to be millions upon millions of dubiously obtained resources filling up the pool. I personally don't think it will take more than a few hours for any of the goals to be met. This won't even be much of an event, they may as well just give out the rewards on a timed basis
---
The Impostor outfit looks more demonic.  Especially with the Faschnact Deathclaw Head.
---
You serious?
---
Reminds me of gw2 where in order to access the in game global trading market you have to first open the premium store.
---
Stuff in the punch bowl no longer uses camp budget so go nuts :D
---
I don't understand why?
---
Get the scrapper perk card takes 1 point and scrap all weapons you pick up. I use 1k steel in bullets and I can make that up in a quick ten minutes if not quicker
---
You‚Äôre wrong. After playing NW for 300 lvls I can tell you pistols are a very viable build, and bush Wookiee‚Äôs are fairly easy to kill. The 10 mil pistol, the .44‚Äôs and the laser auto pistol are my favorite pistols to use. THIS SUB hates NW, (full of bush Wookiees and people who would rather have Fallout: Sims) there‚Äôs communities that are striving in NW and are active everyday filled w people who enjoy the mode thoroughly.
---
Responders are too. Basement of AVR Medical.
---
Ash heap
---
I only have a Brahmin for the aesthetic.
---
And that sweet sweet Brahmin milk.
---
All Brahmin are males right?
---
I just built a sweet low level gun and dropped it in a trash can at flatwoods.
---
I went for a sentinels set with secret service and I‚Äôm very happy with the set.  Took about 100 pieces to get a full set that liked but it was worth it.
---
How long is "frequently?" I've been on servers for at least five hours before.
---
Seriously, this. Make an appearance at scorched earth and enjoy almost never have to repair things manually ever again.
---
I think you‚Äôre horrible and should be erased / changed.
---
If you don‚Äôt like this one particular completely voluntary aspect of the game then:
---
Don‚Äôt 
---
Freaking
---
Do it
---
Why? You don‚Äôt like having easy targets for sniping? They don‚Äôt even try and hide
---
A true Raider lol
---
If it's easier, couldn't we just have modus be put into a ZAX Machine since the skin already exists in Fo4? I mean hell we could just straight up have him in an Sentry Bot or some kind of Automatron cobbling of Robotic Parts
---
*Me taking a picture of anything with my 8yo gpu*
---
Cool pixels, huh? Also fog is disabled. And grass. And SAO. ^And ^Lens ^Flare. ^^And ^^shadows ^^are ^^fugly. ^^^And ^^^shit ^^^why ^^^am ^^^I ^^^at ^^^35 ^^^fps ^^^again!?
---
1. Don‚Äôt try NW.
---
2. Don‚Äôt try adventure
---
3. Play something else that you like?
---
Oh I've been on longer than that even. I just meant they will eventually recycle and the junk would be lost.
---
I had thought this was an idea to store junk away until Patch 21 - but as was explained to me, the idea is more to drop it off for other players to grab and store for the event.
---
They have a start on that they just need to fix it. The whole taming system is really crude and unpolished and id love to see them revamp it even if it is just for camps
---
Any time and energy spent on NW is wasted. If kids want to play NE they got fortnite, COD and bunch of other options. No one playing FO76 for NW. Bethesda need to focus on making the original name better and smoother, lets forget about NW already.
---
Does a bear claw count as fists?  Because it counts as unarmed...
---
Can‚Äôt do that - but here have a free player icon from the atomic shop!
---
I just created a Board and crafted/uncrafted the same upgrade 5 times
---
So you think I should be changed or erased? Lol k.
---
I do love NW but hate the campy style. It's better to wait around In a bush untill the end of the game than playing the game properly. They need more town maps and less forest maps.
---
They maybe need to remove all the bushes from the game to fix this issue.
---
Same boat with gunsmith. A few runs has me good to go for at least a week. It's honestly amazing. I'm surprised their still giving them out. I have to remind myself to use them.
---
Naw.  Not necessary.   My average is 12-15 min.   ID card, reactor room, smash cores, replace cores, launch prep.  Key is sprint as much as you can, only kill what is in your way and ignor the rest.   Oh. And having the repaired cores in your inventory.
---
Haha dont worry, I saved for a long time and built a new pc with a beefcake 2080ti and the game still doesnt look as good as I hoped it would ngl. I mean I still enjoy it, but dont worry you aren't missing out on much. But those frames. My god that number hurts me.
---
I would love to have the watchable civic center itself be a map.
---
Tiny compared to other maps but the mayhem...  my god the mayhem.
---
This whole game is a missed opportunity by Bethesda.
---
But yes that would‚Äôve been a good daily
---
I want an Assaultron!
---
Dem sexy....
---
I thought it got fixed because I couldn't ever get it to work for me. Plus, usually I game both sides for Reputation, so I send the Former Raider to Foundation and lie to Roxy for the rep for both.
---
But it happened to be a 3* Legendary Former Raider, so I killed him. (And didn't get anything good for it, but hey, it was scrippable.) I went back and did the glitch for the last half inch of the meter to finish it.
---
It‚Äôs not going to be that hard...
---
West tech, white spring, Charleston  capital building, and fissure are going to be your best bet. Just so you're aware there aren't really anyl guaranteed legendary 3‚òÜ spawns outside of scorched earth and encrypted as far as I'm aware.
---
Not as far as I'm aware, besides not letting people build in your camp.
---
I‚Äôm not really sure the issue here. If it‚Äôs a matter of you two playing together, you don‚Äôt need to be in the same launcher. Steam and Beth net can play together.
---
Yes! I still believe that he should be a collectron skin!
---
He could collect fertilizer, oil, and handcuffs.....
---
Ok, thanks
---
Unfriend him...Sadly no I don‚Äôt believe so
---
Happens sometimes and I like to think of it as flying Air Bethesda. Sometimes you get kicked off of the flight, sometimes the flight takes you to the wrong destination. It‚Äôs very overpriced but the quickest way to get around because it‚Äôs your only choice
---
I mean there‚Äôs the ones up in the fort on third and fourth floor and that weird one on like second
---
Ok that‚Äôs good news. As a non melee guy, it just made no sense to keep something around that was that heavy.
---
Don‚Äôt need it for SS
---
How exactly do you change the glitched machines from 10mm?  You know...for messin with folks...
---
I'll take the cute little opossum to launch nukes with me.
---
I found the plan in a vendor months back, wasn‚Äôt too pricey, but I‚Äôm hoping for good rolls when that super sale comes.
---
Was walking around sanctuary over encumbered with water (can't run) when a virtibird suddenly tailspins out of the sky and chops me to bits.
---
I dislike them and the Enclave, too. But this game doesn't really give us options like singleplayer games do. So I'll pitch in and help for community goals.
---
Uranium fever event spawns 3, always 3 star, but they're only level 45 I think.  Riding shotgun event spawns a level 80 3 star
---
Contact Bethesda support and hope for the best? They're aware of the issue, so it'll probably be fixed in the patch coming next Tuesday.
---
Horde events.
---
I agree! I mean, at least the collectrons gather things for you. What does Sofia do&gt;?
---
Level 35 I believe. Maybe 40. You will never get max level gear off them (and 45 is max level for some gear)
---
Honestly I'm running at 60 fps (after many sacrifices) most of the time except in some specific locations where the enlighten effect -that glossy reflections on surfaces- is heavy. For exemple, as soon as I go through the vault's door of the Enclave, my fps go from 60 to 40. I tried many tweaks but it's either that or completely deactivate the enlighten effect and having to deal with super dark areas and buggy water textures. 
---
If the game isn't running as good as you expected, you might want to check if you disabled the built-in vsync the game has. It's just terrible and actually made me lose quite a lot of fps for some reason. Just have to be sure that you can lock your fps somehow.
---
I think the legendary effects are what a lot of people get a high from when it comes to getting loot. 
---
Being able to work towards an op bonus is fun
---
You know, so long as the devs keep adding tough new tasks for us that reward more even more op loot.
---
This is how I pictured encrypted when I was level 30
---
I can‚Äôt wait to join the Akatsuki!
---
Sorry, been like that from the start.
---
Yep. It's been like that for a loooong time.
---
You can still find lots of tech data all around though. It's not super rare.
---
For your viewing pleasure

Awesome thanks, I feel like a shitty glicher because my friend put them and I didn‚Äôt know it was a glich
---
Not to be a dick, but basically all of this is wrong. The part about them being durable is mostly correct but that's about it.
---
I have good luck at the Watoga Civic Center rooftops. The Super Mutant with a mini gun usually is a 2-3 for me. (Still can spawn a 1 though.)
---
If you find 2 or more in the same place (or around the same place) just take them all and before turning in the documents put the other ones away in a separate stash and once you turn in the first simply pick up the other, at least in my experience it starts the quest again. This obviously does not apply for the other ones you may have in your own stash, just the ones you found during that session.
---
Still kind of a let down though. Oh well.
---
Check here [Fallout 76 Plan &amp; Mod Database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GSBbydRo8dbqZP0iXdGXg3RYat8k4qljPcW50tR_El8/edit#gid=60244728), look under armor tab, combat armor is right at the top of the list.  
---
Lists says Free States, Watoga and Whitesprings vendors as well as Grahm.
---
I'm on Xbox and even here it takes a full 15 to 20 seconds for the menu to show up.
---
That‚Äôs happened to me.  Bastards haha.
---
Yeah, I think its 40, point is they don't spawn top gear
---
I did the swap at 200.  I made a character to do it but quit at level 8. I‚Äôm done the swap now and I‚Äôm thrashing stuff with my bloodied commando.
---
Before 76. the popular lore (as I understood it) was that traditional money was backed by gold, but gold was inaccessible (maybe even gone) and too rare of a commodity to be traded en mass. Since there was a finite amount of them in the world, and they couldn't be replicated Caps became a good substitute currency. idk why, it seems that someone could fix and power a stamper but I digress.  
---
However, in fo76 there is obviously the ability (not for players) to stamp caps. or at least the outcome of "the new Arrivals" would suggest that there is. so? the Lore is full of alternative facts. lol. I suppose that as time goes by the machinery at the bottling plants will become inoperable. try as we might, we know that resetting the "gold standard" is not a successful endeavor, and caps remain the dominant currency in the fallout universe. well, caps and 5.56
---
The backpack looks cute! In a creepy way.
---
On ps4 pro. And yes they are worth it but get internal not external.
---
Communist gaming comrade!
---
Why not find a group?
---
I usually find 3-4 legendaries while doing a Burrows run, it's a pain considering how long you take to clear the whole place, but most of the time there are quite a few legendaries or crowned enemies there.
---
Post your platform in case someone can help! 
---
In terms of tips, you gotta cripple the legs if you can't kill them fast. Enforcer perk + any ole shotgun
---
Also, WOW.
---
I think it‚Äôs ironic... because if we can smelt, forge, paint, etc...
---
It would be an easy item to counterfeit in the wasteland. üßê
---
I still want my Australian Blue Heeler dog, original Dogmeat from Fallout 3.
---
Thank you all for the tips, im going to do a big farming session next time im online
---
I like the enclave cause im evil hah. will still probably pitch in for the rare stuff. youre right though, its a bummer its so linear and you gotta make nice with everyone.
---
Wait, there‚Äôs a brew that requires flux? When the hell did this happen?
---
Thank you!!
---
How?
---
For reference it took me over **10 attempts** at level 80 in order to get through it. Although mine was due to a glitch that kept happening that when I emailed Bethesda support they just said ‚Äútry again‚Äù.
---
Just get a lot of ammo and use the *chinese stealth suit* and take cover. To get the sentry bot I hid in a bathroom
---
Yeah I logged out and logged back in , there‚Äôs a just 7 second lag now which is about normal.
---
If I don't get an ED-E skin for my eyebot, heads are gonna roll
---
Looks great!
---
They are fucktards who play with the law loopholes as it shows its not a pure in game spending store!
---
I have over 179 in my inventory from just ignoring that quest because it‚Äôs so out of my way. I turned in one and now the rest of the stack won‚Äôt enable the quest so I‚Äôm probably gonna sell them via vendor or to a bot
---
Giggity
---
Same thing happened to me just now. Went to the Crevasse Dam to kill something on the Ally mission and couldn't believe that she was there with me. That's the other end the map. Then she looked like she was going to run all the way home so I managed to complete the event by chatting with her and fast travelled to my next mission. Weird. She did well in the fight.
---
it will be much easier with a few more levels and better gear..
---
I would start looking for a troubleshooters weapon too.. after I took my first toon through I went right to a vendor and bought troubleshooter guns for the other two.. lol
---
Sentinel isn't the prefix though...
---
Oh I love those kind of fights! The best I've seen was scorchbeast vs mirelurk queen and today 2 scorchbeast (one of them legendary) vs deathclaw in a camp, they destroyed the whole place lol
---
What platform do you play on?
---
You gotta file a report on Bethesda.net
---
Ugh, whatever. Some people take this game so seriously. It's an incentive. No business gives away good free items; it's literally the equivalent to an impulse buy at the checkout  being your free gift for spending $50 on cheese or w/e.
---
What!!!!!!!!!  Dude teach me
---
Omg that is awesome!
---
remember what happened last time there werent enough resources...
---
You can also occasionally get the plans from events.
---
That would be awesome to have him as a vendor console for our camp like the Slocum joe robots.
---
If you‚Äôre on xbox there‚Äôs always a looking for group tag, and idk if ps4 has something similar but pc and ps4 can always find discord groups
---
If you don't have Fallout 1st your stash is limited to 800. Folks dump out excess junk as they have to be strict about their inventory. If they're going to toss stuff, then why not deposit it into these receptacles. Folks with 1st can loot the receptacles and save for the event.
---
Checked out Huntersville.  Started with 5 floaters. 1 was 3* and another was 2*.  In town comes across a 3* and 2* mutant
---
I'll check it out! And I'll spread the word to a larger group I'm with also
---
Only 8? Some people that also didn't know this old one had up to 300.
---
i kill myself regularly with my own shotgun
---
I‚Äôm ps4, my psn is bandkcamp want help?
---
Yep
---
They don't work if you buys them via a vendor sale either. Not sure you can sell them to bots.
---
Vault 79 glitch. Always 3 star sentry bot
---
Even if it‚Äôs not 76 related that was funny as shit.
---
Honestly, that would have been an awesome plot twist if that was the case. Like it would have been great if they had worked in FEV exposure to vault 76 as part of the plot line...
---
In which case, we play the game knowing full well that one day we will become supermutants.
---
Bruh stop. Nobody but you wants to scrap survival mode.
---
What do you get from milking sentry bot? Waste oil? üòÇ
---
I don't think we have to worry much about these donations, as dupers and hackers either have enough materials allready or can quite easily get them within the first day.
---
Ps4
---
You're still pretty low level and you're attempting hard quests and areas above where you should be.
---
Upvoted for slobberknocker
---
Does anyone else know just how many f'ing scout masks I scrapped?!?!?!??!!
---
It has been at least a year and if I ever saw one for sale I would buy it.
---
For some reason the items they‚Äôre giving away are monthly rewards. I guess to make you feel like you need to get membership immediately rather than feeling like you can just get it whenever you want it. Not sure if that‚Äôs what you meant or if they actually had free items that they revoked later on. Either way, it‚Äôs the kinda stuff that makes me feel like $100 a year just isn‚Äôt worth it.
---
Thanks, my bad, didn't even know about the event
---
Hey man. We just traded. I‚Äôll help you. Psn is delsquest
---
i was asking the guy if he wanted help lol
---
Remember, they said we can get rare plans for contributing though... I like the raiders so at least I can justify helping by the fact that I‚Äôll be benefiting myself
---
You can they‚Äôre worth 1 cap to them even with hard bargain.
---
I wish there was a comprehensive guide or Discord for building/decorating glitches. They‚Äôre harmless, victimless glitches for customizing  your virtual home or overcoming the game engine‚Äôs bugs. 
---
FFXIV has many resources for home decoration glitches, which allows for a lot more options and things which should technically be in the game. There‚Äôs a Discord and a Google Doc or Google Sheet (or a few lol) with links to written guides or videos on how to do each ‚Äòtrick‚Äô. It‚Äôs really handy.
---
Having not played FO4 in forever and having forgotten almost everything, I just had to rediscover the super easy yet super handy electricity clipping glitch and replacing door frames with walls. It would be nice if the more out-of-the-way tricks were all compiled together in one place. I‚Äôd work on it myself but I‚Äôm not knowledgeable on what all is available. Hell, I still don‚Äôt know if I understand this one lol.
---
How do I replace perks?
---
I too had to attemot rhis quest a few times. The first time, everyone got stuck in the first locked room. The second time, the game straight up crashed. Another time, it wouldn't let me speak to a certain group of individuals inside.
---
It's tricky
---
Oh lol ha ha sorry. I thought you were a higher level.
---
Yeah I paid for a year of FO1st and they revoked a good fucking chunk of things from early in which isn‚Äôt fair because I got it for those things then ended up unable to play
---
Yeah, don‚Äôt think i‚Äôd be struggling with thatüòÇüòÇ
---
It was pandemonium
---
nuclear material. It's a sick bot.
---
Please tell me this is satirical...
---
I can hook you up tomorrow if you can't find anyone. IGN Sgt\_OKeefe.
---
No I genuinely think that nuclear winter is the future for, I am sorry to say is, a dying game
---
Wouldn‚Äôt it be better to set up a list of people that have first and will agree to hold it, and all of us non first people just give it to them to hold?
---
Exhalation of air through nostrils!
---
I think I had an aneurysm trying to comprehend that logic
---
Dying game?!? Literally tons of people play it, servers are full, players are actually kind and help you. NW is a cesspool or sweaty tryhards and the occasional cheater
---
Theres an enclave group I'm apart of that has all three platforms, If your interested I can do you a link to join to get help.
---
I‚Äôm sure you did because just putting it simply, the people who actually enjoy playing the survival mode of fallout 76 don‚Äôt have must to work with mentally wise
---
If you shoot them once, they go hostile and you can VATS them normally.  I just consider it a way the event has added difficulty since it's so easy to solo now anyway.  While it would be great to be able to VATS and kill right away, it just adds a bit of challenge to an already easy event.
---
On Xbox nuclear winter is an enjoyable experience since we don‚Äôt have many hackers I guess your experience is a symptom of playing on an inferior gaming machine I guess
---
I don't have a problem with carrying weight. Endurance armor buffs have never increased HP
---
Yep, that's the 'damage bug' the one they said they 'fixed' months ago but it's still in game just harder to trigger.
---
Depends on when KLEO was reprogrammed. We don't technically know how old she is, could be pre-arms dealer KLEO.
---
Lol üòÇ
---
One of the main reasons fallout 76 is still kicking is because of the influx of new players from game pass and if what they are greeted with is a buggy mess of a survival mode they probably won‚Äôt be sticking around
---
Play nuclear winter you get about 200 caps per win
---
Thanks for the tip! I think i have vsync disabled in game but I'll have to check tomorrow when I get on. I'm just sometimes look at the land itself and the details of things like buildings or trees and they just seem, in the best way I can put it, fuzzy. Like the texture just isnt there. Not sure if it's my own fault or not
---
I want a Red Heeler... as a personal preference
---
Don't trust the enclave!
---

---
I'm not sure it's broken. I think that bestheda patched that out. It seems that you don't really get anything of value for doing that side quest anymore either. in my experience.
---
buggy mess, have you even tried it out! Yes there is but it‚Äôs much better then the battle royale in this game, you probably haven‚Äôt seen the great storyline of wastelanders, you hopped on the hate bandwagon and reached level 5 killed a couple of liberators and said this game is buggy

---
Exactly that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying, some people are so fucking ungrateful. God forbid if this  was to cost atoms, people would complain how it should‚Äôve just been free to begin with.
---
I laughed really hard at this, but all jokes aside I've been in this group for 2 months, the most fun i've had
---
Ok if your first experience on the survival was dying and not being able to respawn you probably wouldn‚Äôt want to keep playing either
---
Nah like half that spawn for the event are red
---
Finally my cork will have a use
---
Someone picked my junk extractor and collector bot, I missed it this time. 
---
I like to check the map every once in a while to see my camp to see if anyone visits. Sometimes someone show up and becomes wanted, clearly breaking into my stuff, I keep lvl 0 locks on my junk just for common courtesy, bet if you become wanted on my property and I know about it, you will have the shortest running bounty.
---
Those are dope.
---
I would rather have a pile of shit, maybe then I can put it in my C.A.M.P
---
Every day, three per server if silos are available. So do many others. Just keep hoping servers or launch you own.
---
Thank you so much this helped me a lot
---
I've done this many times and gotten nothing but junk and pizza rolls.
---
There are no plans for Headlamps, you need to either find them or buy them from Vendors.
---
IIRC Phoenix in Watoga can sell them, but you'll have to server hop.
---
Although, Red Tactical might have been removed from the game and replaced as an Atom Shop item as part of the Mothman Power Armor bundle?
---
Especially as a melee build
---
I haven‚Äôt played in awhile so I‚Äôm assuming I‚Äôm missing something? Are they planning on implementing pets fully? Sorry for being clueless here.
---
There are fixed spawn points for bunch of them. You should check those
---
While those stretched textures are pretty horrid, I was more disappointed it was a rusty POS. I was expecting the matte black paint but with blood pasted on it and red parts, instead it looks all rusty and shite like the Scaver skin, absolutely horrid to look at.
---
I agree. I‚Äôve only recently gotten into NW (mainly because of SCORE) and it‚Äôs occasionally fun to see how long I can last in a round, but I‚Äôd much rather Bethesda focus on the base game.
---
So you park too close to the side of your house and get into the car, do you end up in your living room?
---
~~What level that you can kill scorch beasts on day one. I'm guessing XP exploit.~~
---
I will give it another go. I'll probably fail and would then like help
---
Think that‚Äôs just you, don‚Äôt die? You get a stimpaks, a machete to kill LEVEL 1 LIBERATORS, this community is so kind and generous, you could probably be playing and 5 minutes later out of the vault a high level player will walk by and drop you stuff, play for an hour and you‚Äôll change your mind.
---
I've only done it once and failed but I actually enjoyed it, I wish people actually showed up for it.
---
Man, so that is a long turnaround then. Okay.
---
lol that's cute, you think they're gonna bother implementing pets that follow you around.
---
no let me help you now
---
I tried to Send a video showing the issue, but tickets don't allow me to
---
She should fall out of the sky if she‚Äôs been cryolated enough. She shouldn‚Äôt stay up if she can‚Äôt flap her wings.

Five pieces of trouble shooters Armor, any type any level, -15% damage from robot per piece.

have a mic?
---
Events give you caps. Manhunt is an easy 120c
---
No
---
exactly
---
I don't :/
---
But at higher levels you obtain so much of it that without the scrap box from first I‚Äôd be 10X overweight.
---
Thank you:)
---
alright, hopping on
---
If it's the dupe method I'm thinking of, then it wont "clean up" anything - they'll just keep duping junk.
---
(Though really it's not duping per se, more exploiting a glitch in how certain containers can be respawned).
---
Ps4 nuked quite often. I carry several nuke key cards but hardly had a chance to use them myself.
---
Fallout Boy is my favorite band! I've seen them 76 times!
---
Scripping Bloodied and Junkies weapons when I used to play at full health.
---
Do you have an enforcer perk or extra perk points? Access perks using the same buttons you use to level up and it should tell you what you got to work with
---
I'm sitting on a Vampire's/Explosive Harpoon gun. Any idea what they're going for?
---
Imagine if everyone‚Äôs ally appeared...the reinforcements have arrived lol
---
It just sours the event, doesn't always happen but there is often a silent glowing  cricket or scorpion to take you out just after the queen dies.
---
I am of course bloodied and in standard armor so probably my own fault.
---
I just want the angry toaster from Old World Blues
---
Huh, didn‚Äôt realize NPCs could pick weapons up off the ground like that. TIL.
---
Now that would be cool
---
Yeah I know. I tend to jump to a high fence or tent the second she goes down and blast everything I can until it‚Äôs completely clear. All the time in the world to loot the corpse
---
Good point I need to do that and stay frosty, as they say.
---
I think he means he's been playing fallout since day one, not killing scorchbeasts since day one
---
You can post pictures by posting an imgur link in your description.
---
While the 76 Reddit disabled the ability to post pictures, that doesn‚Äôt stop the function Reddit itself has that lets you put imgur links in. The picture from the imgur link will even appear at the top of the post too.
---
The issue is that I have it downloaded and she dont and I'd like to just copy it from my pc to hers but I have it on steam and she has it on the beth launcher
---
Congratulations üéâ I'm still grinding out my raider rep halfway through friendly.
---
I was level 150 when I realized I could scrap things at a Power Armor station.
---
The mole rats do
---
They need loads of cork pinboards to keep all their notes (highlights include pamphlets such as "Feeding rations to ghouls, and how to get away with it", "The new pilot's guide to Vertibirds volume 1*", and "How to spot if one of your Paladins is actually a glorified robot"), recipes, lost and found lists, and other assorted bits of paper. They've probably even got one of those snazzy glow-in-the-dark maps.
---
*The chapter covering evasive action in combat is sadly covered in volume 2, of which no copies have yet been found.
---
I mean.......no.
---
I'm on Xbox, and I saw three nukes today across two servers.
---
Are you using the camera or photomode to get these photos? =0
---
I mean...  they don't have to give you anything tbh.
---
maybe its because the car started out broken and hes hoping its slowly going to get better
---
That‚Äôs awesome lmao
---
The low level ones do but the level 50s are a whole different beast
---
Many people has been waiting for the BOS and Enclave bundles and some power armor skin such as X02 was discovered in the data by someone but I have no idea why they don‚Äôt launch them
---
Wait are there going to be pets?!
---
Congrats! I have a junkies one and mod a Penta barrels to it although the damage is weaker than tri barrels but I love the look of penta
---
At the beginning I was putting junk straight into storage without scraping it down.
---
After that it was mostly hoarding weapons and armor I never even ended up using.
---
And I‚Äôm probably doing perk cards all wrong still... I don‚Äôt fully understand builds yet, and I‚Äôm just kind of winging it.
---
If no one does, you could do it yourself and someone will definitely join
---
I'd love to visit your shop :) Would you PM me your GT please? Thanks.
---
Wastelanders is free. To start, go to the wayward near the overseers camp.
---
One was in the 20‚Äôs, other was over 100
---
I am in talks with Meg and Ward in the hope of banding together to show BOS who's the real boss of Appalachia, I will try to get the Blood Eagles to contribute if they can just stop being such assholes for one minute.
---
Was on ps4 earlier today and nobody but me was getting ore.  I also had to heal because people were to busy getting xp to bother protecting the npcs
---
I hope they make an enclave dlc for next year
---
I've had a similar experience before with Sophia as well, not quite as epic but she hung out killing ghouls at an event. 
---
I've seen the Settler wanderer too from someone else's camp partaking before too.
---
Yeah you can purposely drop a weapon and ammo and your companion will swap over to them to kick some tail. 
---
Sophia was once mowing down super mutant's at my camp she took from their leader's cold dead hands.
---
No clue what causes them to follow you into the field tho.
---
Now I gotta make a VATS pistol/team support build and find a trenchcoat
---
Bethesda UI design award 2020 üôÑ
---
That's a good idea. It seems like something that could be coordinated on the various Discord servers.
---
I got it if you want it
---
I have 18k steel sitting in my scrapbox... I did too many Line in the Sand event, lol...
---
Whitespring nuke zone, I think it is the nuked asters around the outer edge of the main entrance garden, the one you approach from the station. And along the right of that area down looking at the entrance doors in the sunken area.
---
Just picked one up, thanks for offering though
---
I feel you.
---
No but likely more than 5k
---
Why is it available on steam for a price?
---
What are the chances Bethesda will either make another currency for this or impose daily drop limits lol
---
&gt;3\* quad handmade
---
I feel for you üò¢
---
I remember a couple months after launch that you could turn in one document and get a load of different stuff but now it‚Äôs just like 1 thing. Kinda weird
---
so wait is there like a minimum donation to participate in this event? because I should really start stockpiling if there is
---
Because the game itself is now sold as Fallout 76: Wastelanders. Its just branding, if you already bought the game you already have wastelanders.
---
My Wandering Traveler would just find the nearest broken chair and start practicing that same two-bar riff she‚Äôs evidently addicted to, and watch us all get fried.
---
Almost everything in the game looks identical irrelevant of gender. Chances are it'll look like the picture, but closer to the shape of your body.
---
Fortnite 76
---
Most of that is pretty trivial with some weapon scrapping from events.
---
Cork though... that is a hell of a lot of golf balls.
---
Your "friend" is as asshole that permanently punkd you. Unfriend them.
---
Yeah since I stopped using turrets and moved away from white spring I‚Äôve never really had FPS drops, even with a full decorated camp (my base is at that same spot). Your‚Äôs looks great btw.
---
Have you looked behind the stall door? I was having the same problem, but it was wedged behind the open stall door. As soon as I closed it, I found it.
---
It was once touted to be released with BoS update. I haven‚Äôt heard a lot about it recently. Hopefully it comes with BoS and One Appalachia.
---
In FO4 they did that all the time when they ran out of ammo.  Usually picked up the worst possible available option, like a missile launcher or a flamer.
---
How about Bethesda just adds the Automatron DLC into Fallout 76.  It works for actual companions and pets if Bethesda is unwilling to give us companions which exist in every previous Fallout game.
---
Just download it over night.
---
Tactics is horrible.
---
I do it on purpose: fighting the queen is fun, launching the nuke is boring.
---
I have launched only once. That was enough.
---
Shrooms? Definitely not. Some of the monsters would set me off the trip tbh. Besides, can hardly even operate a TV yet alone play a video game in that state. Go outside.
---
I lost 143... üò¨
---
Fo sho!
---
The last two times I‚Äôve done it I haven‚Äôt gotten any of the flux or repair kits. I still get the legendary loot from her body but that‚Äôs it.
---
Our duping buddies will step up to the plate (made of plastic) and create all the sweet plastic and other materials in break neck speed.
---
I like the enclave because I wanted serum.
---
Like survival should have been? Awesome. 
---
To be honest, both modes should exist.
---
You may want to take a look at this. https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ht8ra7/failed_to_launch_scan_and_repair/fygpim3/
---
I thought they said they didn‚Äôt want a world where everyone had a follower, if anything pets are gonna be camp companions
---
Hmmm. Can a ‚Äòfriend‚Äô build blueprints in your camp???  Items yes. Blueprints???
---
That‚Äôs funny, I went to Atlas for the first time this week and after finding all the entrances boarded up I immediately felt like the Brotherhood would use it as a base
---
How exactly do Bethesda keep a total and do we actually think it will have any relationship to what players do in game. It's just numbers, and it's not transparent.
---
Exactly there philosophy, we fucked the entire game up, so as compensation have a shitty icon that you will never use.
---
First and last thing they should see is a nuke being dropped on their new home at ATLAS.
---
My pets get deleted when updates come out so I just don't bother anymore.
---
Get the dirty tan suit. It will give you the "Dark Knight Returns" Joker, maybe the best Batman thing ever. 
---
I did the same for a while. Golden paint for the 44 also helps. And the tire iron is a close as you can get to a crowbar.
---
You're very welcome. Have fun vault dweller!
---
Theres almost always player tents on site. I head there the moment the event ends so I can offload flux first before I do anything else.
---
I carry a Bloodied/FFS LMG, just melts them in seconds, don't bother me much. They're also good eating.
---
If you continue to keep up with the rest of the dailies and weeklies, you should be fine. I missed the entire first week and caught up to Zorbo.
---
You sound like that robosexual in Watoga.

Recurring mistake - Getting excited about finding something in a vendor for a reasonable price, only to realize after I buy it that it's underleveled. One of these days I'll learn...

Ive been buying serum recipes as soon as I get over 20k. I dont know what my next plan will be though once I buy all of them
---
Pretty sure they mean scoring in NW, not S.C.O.R.E.
---
I suspect this is going to be the case as well
---
It would be so funny to see people's pet chickens trying to gang up and take down scorched at a SBQ event.
---
I have every lever you can imagine. All combos, all rolls. 
---
Best one? Bloodied faster fire. Even when it doesn't make a world of difference, it feels faster.
---
Second best one? Bloodied, one star.
---
Third? Junkie's. Then, antiarmor +critical. Then, instigating. And I would say it is a tie between instigating and Stalker's (all your vats shots can be critical headshots). 
---
To be honest, the explosive effect is great for commandos, but not that awesome when you are shooting heavy and slow.
---
Fallout NV confirms that bottle caps are actually incredibly hard to counterfeit, due to a lack of bottle cap printing machines (most trading companies deliberately destroy them to prevent counterfeitting) and fake bottle caps being notoriously easy to spot (hand crafted bottle caps can be differentiated from pre war caps by most experienced traders)
---
If anything, he‚Äôd try to contact them. He contacted the other Army soldiers during the settlers quest line.
---
The support system if purposefully cryptic and difficult, for obvious reasons.
---
Last time I checked (soloed the event and picked up everything out of pure curiosity) I got about 1560 steel from scrapping all the weapons and junk. (And I was at 70+ int by that moment,so it totally was the maximum I could get). I don't think you'll ever be able to get twice that number, but close to 2k is quite possible with more rifle drops, yeah.
---
But you just said your "more inclined to buy items that you keep taking out the shop" so arnt you just contradicting your entire post?
---
I had a similar issue. Turns out I had to install Direct X on my PC to get the game to run.
---
aka give me more useful free shit so i don't have to pay
---
Such a good, glitchy boy.
---
I last got killed the second after the queen died by a cricket, no chance to get to a tent. I should join in with those on tents and fences, but I enjoy the freedom of fighting the queen over a larger area and running about.
---
Floors, foundations, stairs and probably some other stuff cannot be destroyed and have no hp.
---
I just want them to glow happily in a roomy enclosure.
---
Ya most people don't care who fucks who
---
Ah yes, I see now, funny how I took it the complete other way ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
But just two of them will be quite enough.
---
Nice, good job doing the math! Here are some more tips:
---
* The rewards are hot ass.  
---
* Contribution countdown timers are promotional garbage and Bethesda can't afford the bad PR of missing several of these milestones so OF COURSE they'll fudge the numbers to make it look like "Yay we did it guys!"  
---
* Wasting resources on this crap is for suckers.  
---
* Make easy money off these suckers by stocking your vendor with bulk junk of the appropriate variety during the deposit windows.  That way you get the reward unlocks AND easy caps while they do your legwork for you.
---
I had a lvl 14 come to my camp yesterday and text me "can I have free stuff".
---
So I dropped some Rad-X, Rad-Away, and grenades I'm not using.
---
He texted "I want clothing"
---
So I guess beggars CAN be choosers.  I blocked and muted him.  Homey don't play dat.
---
BETHESDA:  Can we PLEASE get an emote for "Hit the road, bum!"
---
That last bit is the toughest. Im also there with the settlers rn. Stay strong pal! The end result is worth it.
---
The minigun is a beast and the ammo factory is super convenient.
---
Would you say mutation recipes are good investments?
---
I still make plenty of caps on amno. I've had a strange uptick in people buying cells and cartridges lately, can't make up my mind if it's people actually burning thru them that fast or they think they're going to be able to resell them with a markup(lol those guys).
---
To hell with that noise... Being able to put those one pound mats in the scrap box is a life saver. Only way that would work is if they made flux weightless.
---
(Best way to avoid losing flux is if you get downed after a Queen fight just leave the server, if you don‚Äôt die completely before you leave you‚Äôll keep your junk.)
---
Thanks buddy. I just finished it about 30 minutes ago. I wish I knew about this trick weeks ago. Ugh. But that‚Äôs my error. I‚Äôm a filthy casual at lvl 96. I still have no idea what I‚Äôm doing in this game. Ha!
---
Long term, I believe so. I sell serums like crazy.
---
&gt;karma whores
---
Pretty much all politicians world wide.
---
Except the ammo factory can't make 2mm EC. I stopped using the Gauss minigun like 2 days after I got it and fished for a LMG, like it much better and a 2 shot plasma caster for non legendaries.
---
Imo, it's because caps are pretty worthless for legendary trading. I don't bother selling legendaries in my vendor because either they're bad enough that I'd rather scrip them, or good enough that they're worth offering for weapons I want on trading subs. You'd think there would be a middle ground of items that are too good to scrip but still only really worth caps, but I'm almost always near cap limit so I don't feel any incentive to sell them. On very rare occassions I'll find a replacement for something in my main loadout, and I'll sell the thing getting replaced for a few hundred caps just because of the sentimental value. Sure, someone's probably going to scrip it anyway, but I tell myself maybe they'll be like me and cherish it until they manage to upgrade from it. Meanwhile, I frequently go vendor hopping looking for good legendary weapons and very rarely do I find anything that interests me, although that's probably because I'm looking for Junkie's stuff; I still see a metric shit ton of Bloodied, Unyielding and Bolstering. I figure they're probably like me and aren't interested in taking caps for their good stuff.
---
I think they need to give player vendors functionality beyond caps. Let me list something as "trade only," and let me list items that I'm interested in buying or trading for. Of course, this would also require them to give us an actual trading interface that lets us barter items directly, but they need to add that regardless.
---
Neat! I also rolled a junkies but I dint like that effect that much and its only a 1*
---
If you have a Google account you can sign in with Google.
---
I about to buy my tenth if that says anything.
---
Got‚Äôem! Good spot mate!
---
My first one was a bloodied faster fire rate and 25 less vats cost
---
I think functional coding is too much to hope for.
---
How much are people selling the plan for? I've been server hopping vendors to try and buy one, since (I think we can all agree) the plan is sadly currently unobtainable via normal means.
---
Who would've thought that a fucking radiation barrel is rarer / more difficult to get than a Fixer (I have multiple plans of the latter).
---
Well no, it cant craft 2mm. But it does 5mm crazy fast, It makes it as fast or faster than I consume it with my B gatling gun.
---
What should my first one be?
---
If you just looking to farm the 1400c allowed. Honestly, just go Emmet Mountain take down the scavengers, loot their stuff and go sell them. Hop servers and repeat it, it should only take u 3 times of doing this and you‚Äôll have 1400c.
---
Also, West Tek, the super mutants drop a lot of stuff.
---
Cultists always say their last words before dying... even after I've blown their heads off.
---
That is a great roll! Im aiming for a bloodied faster fire rate 90% less weight. Hope to get one some day.
---
For now my furious will do for the colosal problem.
---
COMFORTING MOO

I'm sure there was a guy on here the other day that got greifed by someone saying they wanted to trade so they joined a team. The guy then laid 4 ammo plants before the guy quit the server. He's stuck with them now
---
Comforting moo
---
A Modus terminal as an ally item would be nice, I'd enjoy going out on a daily mission for the Enclave.
---
I would think everyone with F1st will still have the muscle memory ingrained to have been picking up every golf ball they see so i imagine the scrap boxes will have a ton of cork and plastic so we should have a leg up on that to start with.
---
I wonder if they will do this sort of thing from time to time to spring clean the scrap boxes. No idea how much crap is in mine these days.
---
&gt;Best way to avoid losing flux is if you get downed after a Queen fight just leave the server, if you don‚Äôt die completely before you leave you‚Äôll keep your junk.
---
I had no idea, I'll remember to Alt F4 if it happens again. Thanks!
---
This is dumb. No way I‚Äôm just donating materials to this. It takes time to get scrap with how some of us play and cosmetics aren‚Äôt enticing enough to empty my stash of scrap. Regardless if the community contributes this or not unless there‚Äôs a personal goal we have to meet to get the rewards then there‚Äôs no incentive.
---
Also, due to "logging" if it was you and not a friend who placed them I would be honest about it if submitting a ticket.
---
Marsupial sells. So does Speed Demon. The going rate is usually around 300 caps per mutation.
---
Alright thanks
---
The first one I got was a Bloodied, 90% Less Weight one. But I wasn't a Bloodied build :(
---
üòÇ
---
you can not stack them ANYMORE (since Jan this jear i gues.. )  
---
it dosn't matter how many u have in your inventory ;-)   
---
if u have more than one sell them  for 1cap at any vendor
---
Is there any examples of a "correct" ticket? Or anyone who actually got a refund and can help me
---
Lol
---
Ran into a camp that had at least 5 ammunition plants.
---
Np
---
Things broken remain broken when you log out. People even use a build glitch that involves destroying a piece to allow them to overlap after a repair.
---
What‚Äôs your build?
---
I wasnt one either until I got my full set of Uny SS armor. Its fun to spice things up. If you didnt scrip the gun you should try it some time.
---
Incentivizing people to drop their membership would not be a very wise ploy on their part.
---
Wait what how did they manage that?
---
He was with 5 others doing a glitched Line in the sand event and was insta-gibbing everything under the sun with this weapon so he wasn't really trying to hide it I guess.
---
Rn bloodied heavy weps non-PA
---
But I can switch to full-hp heavy weps with or without PA
---
i have a 3 star limb damage fixer
---
all I want is to be able to pick up the orange traffic cones and wear them like a hat
---
Oh no, I've kept it around. Can't bring myself to scrip such an item, but I've stored it since I got my Junkies.
---
Oh maybe you can then.
---
I feel your pain. I want the gold handmade paint. 
---
Couldn‚Äôt get onto the Atom shop last time the raiders pack was up 6 odd weeks ago
---
I just discovered I had the 800 limit. That's a bit annoying.
---
Doggy Down syndrome exists too.
---
They're a bit of a crutch and I wish they would explore regional differences among them. I do like the suggestions in this game that they were oppressive and shaking down ordinary people for supplies.
---
Two neat weapons. Im more of a Furious guy for my full hp build. Keeping the mutations seems too much work for me hahaha
---
I would love a Mr. Handy
---
I've been trying to keep my full
---
Thanks.
---
Jeez... seeing these pictures makes me feel useless but also happy and amazed
---
Question how do u guys get people at your camps? I found a dude so far and he said he would come to my camp but he never appeared
---
Probably because heavy weapons have one job whereas the rifles can be modified for long range, close quarters or sometimes fully automatic. 
---
But that‚Äôs just my reasoning
---
I can give you something on XB what level are you?
---
Adorable little bits trying to spout propaganda at you. And there's even something cute about their laser sound effect.
---
In the Cranberry Bog, which is the most likely area you'll see nuked by other players, look for radiated Brain Fungus which will be red now, or radiated Diseased Cranberries which will be purple but give you Raw Crimson Flux.
---
Make sure to slot in Green Thumb in Perception so you pick two instead of one.
---
Once you get 10 Raw Crimson Fluxes pair it with 1 Hardened Mass, 1 Glowing Mass, and 1 High Radiation Fluids (you get all these from killing creatures inside the nuke zone) at your Chem Bench and you will get 1 flux (possibly 2 if you have Super Duper from Luck slotted).
---
But you‚Äôll only be able to turn in 100 every 24 hours.
---
I too just run ore everytime the event pops up. Surprise surprise, it's just me doing it. Usually get about 50 and thats it :(
---
Yup ,did a third one. Got queen loot. Still no repair kits or flux for the third time today. All my armor is broken and it's really gonna be a pain to have to collect enough scrap to repair 5 pieces of armor.
---
The 6k caps for 300 gold per week is definitely not enough to sink all those caps. I hope they'll eventually add a similar thing for scrips.
---
Watoga would be dope with all the trenches
---
Replace the existing terminal with a modus one and we have him lecture us when there are new dailies to be completed
---
A gutsy+robo brain alteration would make a cool boss / pet either all lol.       
---
         
---
(Robo brain head gutsy body and arms)
---
Hell personally I'd love his mutation sleep anywhere
---
I used Chinese stealth armor (makes you invisible) for the ‚Äòhidden‚Äô attack bonus that multiplies damage (helps to have the perks to max the multiplier). Did this with mostly powerful melee weapons (mostly puncturing power fist). Took a long ass time even then - had to grind it. And often run away just to become ‚Äúhidden‚Äù again. Load up on stimpaks - and pulse Gernades work very well against robots also. Best of luck!
---
I don‚Äôt understand it either as a gunsmith I know for a fact there are plenty of modifications you can do to any gun I‚Äôve worked on a lot of heavy guns and have seen many things done to them so only having one to five mod choices is just ridiculous.
---
One thing you can do is get the 1st subscription for a month or two, and you farm junk incessantly. Your 1st stash remains active for extraction only at the end of the period. Not ideal, and I do wish that they at least doubled the stash limit for non-1st players. I have 1st, but my buddy doesn't. It makes me sad when I hear his frustration at times when we play.
---
&gt; The rewards are hot ass.
---
I kinda the rewards are pretty neat.
---
What a sad bunch don‚Äôt ya think. I really don‚Äôt get why someone would cheat in video games, ‚Äòhey I‚Äôm a loser look at me‚Äô lol
---
Rewards are nice and don't seem that difficult.
---
 that character is a full health stealth Commando build, so I tend to favor fixers almost exclusively, but if you find yourself struggling with 45 ammo because you're going through it too fast with an automatic, the hand made is almost as good but lacks the bonus to stealth that the fixer has
---
Edit to add: if you're looking for information on builds I highly recommend either angry turtle or bad company Sarge on YouTube. Both of them offer a lot of different builds and even if you don't want to copy one of their builds which I didn't, they explain the whys and wherefores of their choices and it helps you understand synergies
---
I guess that's yet another thing to create an illusion of player activity, provoke some more online presence. Something to at least temporarily raise the numbers they present to their investors. Ofc it won't do jack to already ruined in-game economy.
---
I just had this happen yesterday! Wanderer chased the queen into the nuke zone, made it harder than it needed to be. When it was over, Wanderer started running(not teleporting) in the direction of our home, a couple players on hot mics asked WTH why is your Alien Uncle Sam crossdresser here. Didn't see Wanderer again until today, when she seemingly remembered how to teleport.
---
The Ammo converter update is gonna bring more replayability than wastelanders.
---
Really? Was that on ITV?
---
to be honest, does this game really *need* a player hub? I kind of like how decentralized everything is, makes it feel more like a wasteland.
---
That‚Äôs where I bought mine for like 500 caps. It‚Äôs a must have for bloodied builds because it works better than the rad barrel. I have mine hooked up to a switch whenever I need a good ol shot of that sweet radiation lol
---
Also I find melee is the most effective way to get the fluid. I find I spend a lot less time looking in the grass for dead fireflies. Sniping fireflies with your tse Gatling plasma also seems like a bit of a waste does it not?
---
I've always thought The Whitespring would eventually be a hub it is setup with hand sensors, I would also be ok with Valut 76 becoming something similar to this also.
---
Your mom‚Äôs house.
---
I can donate more than my fair share of steel and plastic but I have stuff all concrete.
---
That's the same reason I want it but I want it near shower , nice thing to have near the shops/ workshops
---
You have to build the ally thing in your camper. It's under a special category called ally
---
Its kinda sad how awesome the concept art always looks as compared to the real game. I still blame the Creation engine.
---
I just discovered her the other day.  Awesome addition.
---
Smort. Hope this reaches more visibility so lots of people do this. 
---
This event is gonna be tough, ngl. Steel and wood are easy for me, i know how to farm thousands of those. But the others I have no clue.
---
Once you complete all challenges you can only get it from the legendary run or buying it sadly.
---
Ahhh ok thanks. Hope after I do it he still comes
---
Over. He‚Äôs the only person I‚Äôve found so far to offer to come over.
---
3 pretty quick today on one server, queen was killed before I could get there everytime tho
---
+karma
---
WE NEED THE ROBOT WORKBENCH FROM FALLOUT 4.
---
Player hub events, defend the trading post
---
I thought the Character tab was different for every character unless that was changed recently because it was working like that about a month ago for me
---
Ya it‚Äôs really nice to have. I‚Äôve only seen it once on both of my accounts and I‚Äôm pretty high level, It‚Äôs just hard to find grahm to even buy these plans
---
im not 100% sure but i only had one flamigo left of budget when i changed out my brahmin for the coop i now have 3 flamigos worth of budget to spare
---
Anything to help people stay at the hub for long amounts of time
---
It‚Äôs busted at the moment and all characters are put together don‚Äôt know what happened but it‚Äôs been like that since the legendary run was added.
---
I can‚Äôt believe your game looks that clean and sharp. That‚Äôs a badass cryptid, the hardest of them all. Great work.
---
Yeah, Whitesprings has a lot of potential

---
Doesn't sound like the Brotherhood I know. They don't give people jack shit....
---
This one time, they treated me like a sad loser with no friends and promised I could join their gang if I pulled a key card off a dead guy in a hideously irradiated bunker call the Glow. I did it- still got treated like a punk.
---
Brotherhood hazing never ends.
---
It would be deadly in PA!!
---
You do get one to follow you about for a short while if you do the main quest from the Settlers ;) really cute!
---
Same here.... -.-\*
---
Yes
---
(I am)
---
The sentry bot is the last enemy. I got all ready and made more ammo and fixed everything after I fought it thinking there would be more. I was lvl 150 and I still had issues with the bots so sounds like you did pretty good.
---
Bethesda... 
---
Bethesda never changes ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Thank you, and also for the vault raid can I do it with both of them( not at the same time tho)
---
Would be awesome to see the Whitesprings as their HQ, and making the bunker instanced for new quests similar to the cave underneath Foundation.
---
If I make breakfast my reward is to eat lunch later...
---
I'm so excited!
---
Ahhh... No.  Once it's done it's done.
---
You have to chose a side but, at the end, you can always split the reward equally with both factions. I chose to finish the quest with foundation, split the reward and the raiders had no grudge whatsoever towards me.
---
Ok last question, I can never do the vault raid ever once it‚Äôs done? Sorry for asking a lot I am new and trying to get to know the game a little more
---
Wait, they unbanned dupers?
---
Found a mod a while back so im sure they havnt removed um... Shadow Prime Helmet + Red Headlamp, my enemies shudder when they see my supersledge mangle thier commrades
---
Doubt I can post on this but it just happened to me couldn't unequip or equip any of my weaps. So I searched the web and found this. 
---
Kept getting the message you cannot unequip that. Relogging did fix it.
---
I wish there were visual signs that you were mutated
---
\*edit: grammar correction
---
It‚Äôs the influx of new people causing servers to have more low level players so I didn‚Äôt have a queen fight for a week. But it‚Äôs starting to pick back up again I did at least 5 today, if no one is dropping them I just go do it myself and players always show up (I always check the map to make sure there‚Äôs a decent amount of higher level players tho)
---
I was just saying the other day that I average 2k steel from each Line in the Sand. Though I only got 1200 from my run today because somebody used a tesla cannon and it buried all my meat piles underneath the ash piles and I couldn't loot half the bodies.
---
AFAIK... no. At least not on that toon.
---
Sentry bot with mr handy thrustet please
---
Idk bout the weights mattering but i kno the death tambo def makes noise.
---
I also had this happen and just assumed I didn't do enough damage. It also happened with aLeg Sheepsquatch in the event, I definitely tagged it with a 50 cal enough to count and got no rewards
---
Mine plays the same guitar riff over and over and over and over and over
---
There is stuff you can buy but it‚Äôs all cosmetics that don‚Äôt actually help in the game. Also If you already own the game than you don‚Äôt have to pay for anything, just go to the people outside vault 76 and they‚Äôll direct you to the wayward and that triggers the beginning portion of wastelanders. I loved all the story content and events so don‚Äôt get to overwhelmed just start somewhere and eventually you‚Äôll have tons of different side quests and main quests to do
---
Awww the bushwookies are angry
---
Are they, though? We've got...
---
* A reskin of an existing asset;  
---
* A rehash of an existing event; and  
---
* A rehash of an existing event.
---
Followed by:
---
Those rewards are not "neat". Neat would be a brand-new BOS emote. Neat would be the Anti-Materiel Rifle. Neat would be a BOS autodoc camp object that has the same effect as the Gazebo water fountain at the Whitespring.
---
A more accurate adjective for the rewards would be "lazy".
---
Bloodied builds are fucking useless at this event. Hell most I've seen can't even keep the scavengers alive because they are hiding up where ghouls can't reach them leaving the scavengers defenseless.
---
there is a tab called allies, each different ally requires you to build an item before they come to your camp, you can only have one at a time
---
Where can I find that ID? Do you mean username?
---
It all depends your need - I know people that farm steel all the time, try getting all the mods to a rare gun. Build and scrap - then make some power armor- bye "buy" steel
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Plastic is used by shotgunners all the time and they will not be able to make ammo for a week. Your particular use may not be the same as others.  
---
Concrete is easy to find, for me, because I'm a builder, but it will not be available during the week and weeks prior because people now know what to farm ahead 
---
FO 1sters are going to end up clearing the servers of these items as the week approaches - leaving those that need to farm as they go along without.
---
I average about 2k each time. few days ago we had 4 guys all throwing one grenade in each spawn and by the end we all ended up with over 2k steel.
---
I know where to find all these things until the servers are drained of the resources by the FO1sters
---
I dont really want to spend 40 dollars on this game right now..
---
Powerfist also makes noise, I like the sound honestly.  I never tested if the sounds make you noticed or not tho. Curious now lol.
---
Agreed, but I agree with the poster somewhat. It would be nice if you can put some 'out there' mods on these weapons. Mod a LMG with shotgun rounds, lower the rof and range, but increasing close rang damage. Change out the 5mm to 38 and get less damage but more Armor pen. You could do alot of cool things that would make sense and give weapons so flare.
---
I want a flaregun shotgun darn it
---
This was the main reason I posted this post - but been using a lot of steel lately too, building various Power Armors and I hate using PA - need it to farm nuke zones until I can get SS
---
i've been melted a few times, they can be really hard to see
---
It would be nice. Personally I‚Äôd like a laser Gatling mod that replaces fusion cores with fusion cells for lower damage
---
Ed-E is the only companion I can stand
---
Two shot adds 25% base damage, and splits the damage between each shot. Damage is always divided by the number of projectiles
---
Well,I must've been unlucky then.
---
1k damage is for event reward, otherwise you just get the 4 treasury notes.  Looting the body is much lower and you get the group total damage making it very easy to loot if you have team mates there.
---
I'm bothered because I won't be able to do my usual activities - I'm low on stash space, so I can only hold so much of each item.  Let me guess you pay Bethesda for the honor of holding unlimited scrap and don't ever have to farm as you NEED it?
---
It'd be really cool if you could have a hermit crab bus as an auxillary camp / moving castle
---
I am tunnel runner, I will spend my time gathering ore usually in the 50+ range before I deposit.  I will take pop shots when I can, or use mines or grenades to get some XP or a legendary kill.  I don't have a one shot weapon or a bloodied build.  I do it for the event XP, rare plans and treasury notes. (PS4)
---
This is a great idea!
---
27* only because you can't fast travel when you are overloaded so you have to walk up from the nearest train station
---
Now I am a wizard!
---
Or replacing it with Plasma cores for energy and normal damage.
---
Overall,  there alot they can do and kinda easy. It would make sense and be cool... but i doubt it
---
I was fucking around in the Dolly Sods workshop building some random shit and a Liberator defense popped up. Didn't think anything of it. Some random guy popped up in the base, and both of us got wiped out by the Liberators lol. We were both like "what the fuck just happened?" I think I even had power armor on. Neither one of us took them seriously. We were both over 50, and the bots were around 50.
---
What platform?
---
I wanted the vault-tec canopies so bad last week, got my days mixed up and totally missed it :(
---
Keep em up a few days, 24 hours is just too easy to miss with real life going on!
---
The car even has a WV emblem.
---
I'm with ya there I did at least 3 or 4 today on XB1. Even popped off some lunchboxes for all the folks there.
---
I only got about 1200 from my run today because a guy with a tesla cannon turned all the bodies to ash piles and I couldn't loot the meat piles because the ash piles are bigger.
---
But usually I end up with about 2k
---
Don‚Äôt fight her from the fence or tents. That‚Äôs why she doesn‚Äôt land. Sat on the fence causing the most amount of agro to her and she can‚Äôt target u to land. Being on the ground is exactly where you should be. I‚Äôm saying the second she‚Äôs dead jump to high ground and clear the area. Loot the corpse later.
---
I‚Äôve done the event so many times with all animals left alive and never gotten the plan.
---
I did however get a (likely duped) bloody, faster swing speed, +1 strength bear claw for 20k caps at someone‚Äôs vendor though.
---
It sits up on the wall of one of my cabins
---
I like Fallout, every game had buga but this ... this is something else
---
I'm on Brahmin 59.. :(
---
I want a cat that shoots out laser beams
---
Erm. Maybe check your image.
---
They are only plentiful if everyone on every server isn't looking and spending them. This is just basic HS econ.
---
I was going with fusion cells because they‚Äôre way easier to get than cores
---
You commie fuck, no one wants a pet liberator.
---
We do them daily, usually at least 3 in a row, then a sheep. If we have a good enough group, we‚Äôll do it again on a new server.
---
Changed so that u can complete the legendary run regardless of toon used.
---
I should take a day to farm him . Either that or put a sign up at my camp I'll buy one for like 5000 caps
---
think it‚Äôs to stop bush wookies, not break the game
---
See, that‚Äôs what I thought too but my damage numbers will be, for example, 500/250.
---
None other than PC.
---
Have you tried taming one? I know you can have deathclaws, mega sloth, and others like that... I haven‚Äôt tried taming a possum but I don‚Äôt see why you couldn‚Äôt. They‚Äôre supposed to circle around your C.A.M.P., so you can kind of choose where it roams lol
---
Me too. Several times the last weeks or so.
---
Yup, I hope they wasn't referring to the rewards.
---
That sounds awesome. Glad to meet you too!
---
No you can build it on a foundation.
---
Or a zombie
---
Cork is the scary one, to my mind. I almost never use it, but I don‚Äôt have a huge amount of it, either.
---
It's not negativity diarrhea. If any other company pulled half the shit Bethesda has been there'd be an uproar. They consistently and constantly sell you buggy products and in game items at an absurd margin that don't work
---
1. All is free. just need a copy of fallout 76. All new content is free. you can buy some exclusive wastelanders content  but it's similar to the tricentennial edition. nothing more than cosmetic.
---
2. Everything. seriously if you want something try to take a look on some youtube's video about the item you want to purchase before.
---
3. If you just jump into the legendary run it's 90% sure you can't finish. but try to grind xp and you maybe can get some rewards. 
---
You should focus on human's quests. new money is in-game "gold bullion" you will need to finish quests with settlers / raiders and at the end this new money can be traded for some new items (secret service armors / T65 Power armor / Gauss (minigun-pistol-shotgun) jetpack without power armor etc... because the grind is very awww...
---
4. nope. and probably NEVER.
---
You don't have to be female to have a female toon.
---
OP is sexist
---
ED-E My Love!
---
Despite the nonsense of the Mole Miner event, I really enjoyed some of the rewards like the Treasure Hunter outfit. Here's hoping we get some more good ones!
---
Overall this grind sounds a lot more doable, especially since some of us already have a lot of this stockpiled, and they gave us a bit of advanced notice to start buying bulk from vendors if we don't want to scavenge.
---
None of those three armor types are in NW?
---
Awww thank you. We die a lot and use many Stimpaks and even so there may be no guarantee of a great shot as things are moving so fast at this event. A lot of images get spoiled by bushes blocking the view.

Multiple audio tracks so when you play back the wav file  before you edit your only going to hear what you have set to audio 1 inside obs open what ever audio editing program you use and you should see all audio tracks and hear all audio tracks.  If you don't see all three make sure in obs you have 3 separate tracks.  And make sure you set what ever track the game audio on to what ever you are hearing it on like you said you heard game audio through your headphones but if you had that track set to desktop then it's going to get nothing Also sometimes the audio just gets lost has happened to me a couple times especially with fo76

Public teams. My alternate level 11 account has 3 nukes to her name because bethesda was dumb enough to allow the main quest to auto complete off being in a team.
---
Bethesda just sucks and asking them to fix anything doesn't help. This will be broken for at least 6 months, maybe a year, likely never fixed tbh.
---
Exact same roll in my first 2-3 when I got them. Any of the legendary module weapons you can get whatever you want basically instantly.
---
With player vendor or robot vendor?
---
Now it just looks like fields of clueless players shooting an invisible assaultron
---
Minus completing the event yourself for the first time?
---
Mr robot

Huge let down. You are rightfully upset.

Set up your vendors. Sell aid items ammo, junk. If you have them legendaries. If you price it cheapish you'll love large volume and you'll get more caps quicker than just waiting for a whale. I sell heaps of things in my vendor all priced to move including cheap crap legendaries priced at scrip value and the vendors on my camp earn between 4 to 10 thousand caps a night
---
Uhm stop begging people to store valuable scrap. Find it yourself. There is ZERO guarantee someone will find thier scrap in a suitcase before a server reset.

Dump your own junk commie scum.

Yes. I am a melee build and every time i need to switch cards when i encounter one and even then i do small damage to them while they are in air.
---
yep. They arent the toughest of enemies on their own but get them in a mob and it ruins your day pretty quick

I always do these challenges at a workshop so it doesn't mess with my camp

Yes! :D

Underground has existed since beta, and i dont believe they have a way to detect it. It is an "exploit" that might be addressed when they add instanced camps in the winter season. I think they wouldn't ban for this though.
---
Yes, i am a melee build, i kill them fast when they are on ground, but it takes forever to land on ground. I need every time to switch cards when i encounter one.
---
Ammo at 1 cap unless it's ultracite. I primarily use 45 and 556 and if I see a camp selling either of those ammo at 1 cap each I will buy everything they have. Hell last night I dropped 9k caps one camp for the ammo. But myself and others of we see ammo over priced unless we are in need we will be onto the next camp. So competitive prices definitely works for volume. High level players often hate farming for ammo, I know my early stages I did lots of runs through the mine to craft and sell ammo for caps and now I've got most things I need I buy the ammo. Keep at it and soon you'll no longer be worried about caps either
---
Very nice! Not sure how you pulled that off. Obviously much more skilled than me. ü§ôüèº

I don't have First. I often dump a bunch of stuff in suitcases and  return later to find them empty.

it was always a thing with Skyrim, and I'm pretty sure Fallout 4. If this game copies Fallout 4's systems, then it's highly likely Knives may be better at keeping you hidden during stealthkill VATS sprees.
---
Of which, I hate that VATS presses you against the enemy during attacks, almost garunteed to be seen after a couple in quick succession

Hmm I can‚Äôt find it been searching for an hour lol

---
I usually don't even have heavy weapon perks installed and the Bloodied LMG still shreds, get one or a bloodied 50 cal to deal with them in the air.
---
yeah these are super good, definitely applaud your patience with this. Could not have been an easy feat. Did you have to perk defensively for it or you just did what you could with timing and practice?
---
The american tri centennial? That is the map, and my location is the arrow
---
I saw one earlier that had 7 lol
---
Ahhh I see now lol. Blends in with his nose üòÇ
---
Thank you! A lot of stims, a lot of dying, a lot of cursing, willingness to lose xp because you're mostly in photo mode and a badass girlfriend who is willing to take on anything to get good Fallout shots. There are more here if you want to take a look https://www.deviantart.com/justinspired/gallery

My newest buddy would sometimes get super excited when liberators would show up, had his camp next to a spawn point too. Never really understood. He couldnt hold much junk so he was always low on steel. I dropped 2.5k steel and he was excited as all hell about it. Then he realized he had nowhere to put it. I took back what he didnt use and am now "helping" him store his junk for when he needs it.
---
1st image post. Thought I'd messed it up üòÖ
---
But yeah I wanted to give him a funny nose üòÇ
---
Wood, scout, and marine only.
---
nothing in the original post comes off as sexist, although the same cannot be said about your reaction, but feel free to explain your "logic" of how an acknowledgement of different body types is sexist.
---
the outfit is hella cute.
---
It's not hard to hit the dmg threshold on the SBQ. I'm a semi auto stealth build and I always get the loot.
---
Real talk I don't even know what a BOS Rifle is as once I met the Fixer/Handmade brothers I never looked back. Sniping, contrary to real life, is a semi automatic world. The bolt action etc are useless outside of the Forest unless it's an Instigating gimmick weapon. 
---
In fact, for basic legendarys with a ranged build you should always be able to get a tag on.
---
Practice my friend and ensure your gear is compatible for what you're trying to do.
---
[This](https://imgur.com/gallery/x8NwvxY) is it on my female character.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox. You‚Äôre more than welcome to come see it in game if you are on Xbox too. Just send me a PM with your GT and I‚Äôll switch over to this character.
---
that's obvious, but hardly germane to the OP.
---
I don't know, I don't spend much time in NW.  If they don't exist, why was I able to have them favorited before, but unable to favorite them now after un-favoriteing them?  Is there only wood and scout armor in NW?  And if so, why don't the ghillie skins work for them?
---
Once, I believe it was around Mayor for a day quest, I found stack of 5 in a safe. Took only 1 at the time and turned them in back and forth. Spent some caps for traveling around, but turned in 5 this way.
---
Lol they might as well make a whole new game if they're guna put that much effort into something
---
Yes I know that
---
Uh what?
---
Get a refund instead of asking them a question.  
---
They don't give a shit unless it threatens their profits. Never have, never will. Money is the only language they speak, so speak it loud and clear.
---
I‚Äôm agreeing with you to go with damage reduction over vanguards.
---
Thank you! I've had a lot of practice but at this event with the constant robot mobs I usually use the T-65 power armor with medic pump because I am using taking a couple of pylons as well. There are more pics on my gallery if you would like to take a look https://www.deviantart.com/justinspired/gallery
---
Because most of them were added in 76 and not imported from Fallout 4. The 76 devs put very little effort into having mods for weapons they actually had to create themselves. See also the .44 vs the Single Action Revolver. The .44, imported from Fo4 has dozens of mods. The Single Action, from 76 has only the Ivory Grip...
---
Exactly, VATS is Fallout to me. It's what makes it unique in my eyes. From stop action to slow mo, to live action, VATS works great, when it works.
---

---
That's my full health pa heavy gunner build. I run vamps most of the time and j for big fights. Been using this build for 200 odd levels now.
---
Your build is pretty close, the qol perks are a bit different which is fine. I personally havnt popped a chem since getting addicted haha so leave those perks alone and don't cary more than like 4 stims so I can revive people. I just switch guns when I need to heal
---
I have never tried this, I usually just fast travel back and forth. This would save a LOT of time and loading screens lol. This work for you recently?
---
Pass. Would‚Äôve been cooler as a realistic sheepsquatch outfit, like the Fasnacht deathclaw mask
---
You do they're just extremely rare. There are a few outfits I got this week alone, and a BOS shielded underarmor plan, and a BOS power armor skin.
---
Awol armements always has a 3*. So do hoard events
---
Yeah, everything you‚Äôre saying makes sense now. Maybe I put too much faith in the Vats head damage threshold.
---
Additionally, I just discovered what the fixer was earlier today and blew through 4000 caps on the circuit boards on top of the free one they give you trying to kill encryptid boss to learn the plan so I could farm roll a legendary version from the purveyor but no plans dropped all three times, lol. 
---
By the way, one player fronting the cost for an entire event seems pretty ridiculous.
---
Did you get a video clip that shows his name? You can report that to bethesda and he will get banned.
---
yes, bethesda username and password
---
Do you use vats?  That may help a lot.  As for the SBQ, use a Gatling laser or gating plasma (even a non legendary will do).   Plasma cores are cheap to craft and 3-4 cores will get you rewards even with no perks.  This is a common method rifleman use for the sbq.  Good luck!
---
Well, that would explain it.  But why was  I able to favorite the others with camo skins before?  And why don't the ghillie skins work for the others that are in NW?
---
Yes, i went to Pleasant Hillls Cemetery to farm some level 3 locks and found 2 on 2 different locks. I decided to pick them up to try to save time and caps and when i got there i put one of them in a tool chest and when i turned one in, i picked the other and it triggered the quest again.
---
Charleston would be an awesome arena, so would watoga
---
IGN scott723 I can hold on to them as I get them I run queen so much I get tons all the time that I just drop at train station  I'll just give them to you
---
Better yet, we could get new skin plans from the Whitespring Bunker that allows us to make our pets cyberdogs! Like Rex and K-9.
---
game pass version won't work on a secondary drive untill after it's been installed to main drive first and then moved.
---
I start with the assumption that most people buying weapons and armor from player vendors want that stuff for scrip, so I price it so I make a little more than I would selling it to a vendor, and call it a day.
---
Instead of being chicken chaser, it'd be Chaser Chicken! Look at all the humans run!
---
I hear we're getting 10x and 100x bulk recipes with the patch next week and a max point limit of 100k.
---
I'm not sure about other people, but I produce 2k steel, 1k wood, cloth and leather per week just from scraping items. About twice a week I dump all my excess resources with a friend who has premium, last we checked there was almost 100k steel
---
well, i can't put it on the main drive since it only has 21GB left, is there any other way?
---
No idea about the ghilli skins, maybe they're not marked like the other skins? Maybe Bethesda has another bug in play?
---
Your best bet is submitting a ticket and seeing what they say, since no one is jumping in with a solid answer.
---
Awesome tip, thank you!
---
I swear you have said that to me last year round this time.
---
I have had in the past empty corpses I knew should have something or even more then I see. Especially on legendary mobs. If you press the button to transfer items to the corpse sometimes the items will become visable when it showed nothing before. Has happened way more times then you would think.
---
Not sure if this applies to that situation but if you unloaded 8 cores into her you should have done enough damage.
---
I'm all out of creepy paper and glitter.
---
Yeah i switched out of melee because i got tired of waiting for them to land.
---
Yep they are using an aim assisted trainer. Bethesda are aware of these issues but honestly it's incredibly hard to prevent it. Using GTA online as an example, it's been completely destroyed by the use of trainers since day one of the PC release.
---
Imagine being so bad at a fallout game that you need to cheat in order to play..
---
It never even crossed my mind, they must be as noisy as those new vendors.
---
You won't have to ask that after Tuesday if big if they launch new perk system.  That is gonna make for some interesting builds
---
Some emotes got accidentally released with an update a few months ago and it was for pets doing tricks and other stuff.
---
EDIT: Why the fuck are you guys downvoting him? He was just asking a question.
---
Newby here, Wish I could not fight them
---
There are also a few perks in relation to sneaky melee attacks.
---
You prolly had the same bug or glitch I described above. 
---
I have had countless legendary mobs and regular show no loot after I killed it, by myself even. So when it happens I press X to "transfer" items to that corpse and voila the loot appears.
---
Shotgun build.
---
I haven't had players kill them. they do however randomly disappear all the time ...
---
Fallout 76 disappointed me greatly, I tried to love it, however, it just got boring. The freebies, also boring. Such great potential wasted, along with my $60. A mistake for paying when I could have waited just bought it for $20, 5 days after it launched... #feelsbadman.  
---
Most things about 76 feelbad :(
---
That is one I haven't seen before, I will know what's up if it ever does now, thank you ;)
---
I had a bug today where I couldn't equip any of my weapons kept getting a message "you cannot unequip that". Had to relog to fix it.
---
I've done that twice, feels so good when the hammer drops.  
---
First time I was same as you with team dead and got 12, second was with a team and took out 8 tho also took out 2 of my team who couldn't run fast enough, Won tho.
---
Curious if you craft it and you want to make it sheilded I thought I read somewheres in beth notes you could apply sheilded casual to it not sure.
---
I finished 2nd last night! Well, 4th last person but the other 3 were all on a team. Hiding in bushes whilst slowly making your way to each circle works wonders. They ran passed me twice as the fire closed in.
---
Yeah unless you can see some high levels running it (as in, a bunch of the 300+ kind) I don't bother. It's a shit show.
---
I bought my plans flat out. Not worth the bullshit when 5-6k got me the plans and one circuit is 2k-ish. Finally got my first Purveyor Fixer the other night and it's very schmick!
---
Well I'm sure if you use someone else's and they quit server youll still need to drop game just to play again.
---
If you need someone to run vault 79 with you. Hit me up
---
PSN: Radcooldude55YT
---
I was playing with a friend and we both did that part at the same time so there were 2 Liberators running along next to each other. It was great.
---
I like your build. You SPECIAL's are close to my current shotgun build, so woulldn't have to move too many points around. Couple questions I have is what addiction do you have and do you have a hard time with ammo for heavy guns? I imagine it burns ammo like crazy.
---
This had my interest, but now you have my attention
---
I imagine there are a few 1st members who are sitting on like 0.1% of the entire goal and will say "yeah I can contribute to that".
---
I hope anyway lol.
---
I had that happen when I was using someones armor workbench. Fast travel didn't fix it but pulling out my weapon did.
---
I've heard that it's a proven scientific fact that Fallout 76 cheaters have the smallest dicks in the world.
---
Bruh I live where quakecon is held but never realised till this year
---
From Fallout 3, the scientist outfit (white variant of the hazmat suit), Enclave officer (seems to be a field use version, with environmental protection preceding aesthetics) and colonel Augustus uniform make the top of the list. I would also make a case for Enclave variants of the lab coat and mechanic jumpsuit, since the BoS already has equivalents (science scribe and BoS jumpsuit).
---
Some actual Enclave PA paints would also be quite appreciatedC specially considering that the BoS has 6 paints for depicting different ranks (from initiate to Elder), not to mention the Ultracite PA, which is a BoS design.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt use ‚Äúraider‚Äù gear as a comparison, simply to the fact that many items that people tend to link to the raiders commonly end up worn by other groups quite often.
---
For instance, those full outfit cage &amp; spike armors from Fallout 4 were commonly used by new settlers. Mercenaries &amp; other NPCs tend to use the road leathers, an item which in FO76 uses the same mods as other raider under armor.
---
In FO76 items such as sack hoods end up worn by cultists. My point being that many of the items that people think of as ‚Äúraider themed‚Äù actually end up being used by many groups.
---
Add the fact that raiders are not a single unified group, but tend to be separated into different gangs, with different affiliations. The vanilla story of FO76 had a single raider group split into 5 different gangs. In Wastelanders there‚Äôs 3 major raider gangs: the Blood Eagles, Crater and the Free Radicals. While the former remain hostile, you can actually ally with the other two depending of your choices.
---
Back to faction themed items: a similar argument can be made about regular clothing, including pre-war clothes in many cases, being ‚Äúsettler themed‚Äù.
---
Now, with Wastelanders we did get a few items that are literally labeled as settler/raider, which might help identify the real... problem(?):
---
Most BoS items are not found in the Atomic shop, but rather are found or earned in game. IIRC, the only ATX BoS item is the Elder‚Äôs coat.
---
Personally I actually find such situation quite positive for BoS fans, since most of the BoS related items are not behind a paywall, and as shown in the video I linked previously, there‚Äôs quite a lot of them to be found within the game, which is not the case for most of the other factions, such as the Free States, Responders or even the Chinese, with most of their items, including skins and paint jobs, being only found the in the ATX store.
---
The one category that the BoS themed items do are lacking would be CAMP items, but the same could be said about the Enclave, which as I have already pointed out, also has even fewer earnable items in-game.
---
Mr. Handy buzz blade does too, I've noticed my stealth is worse when I use mine vs other melee weapons.
---
Well you‚Äôre not the only one. A lot of players don‚Äôt know about them. Bought one magic minigun for like 1k caps. And if I see that some one has questions about magic weapons I simply send the link of one of those two videos about them from angry turtle since he makes awesome info and guide videos on Yt
---
The addictions should be listed in the build. I believe they are, daddy o, alcohol, fury, ments and day tripper.
---
And I don't have any problem with ammo, I've spent a lot of my time trading and have bought lots. Have like 100k for each ammo type. An Di tend to run my gattling plasmas and lasers the most, and those are extremely efficient to make ammo for
---
I feel similar about radscorpions. I'm scared of them in every Fallout game god damn. And when in F4 and F76 they gave them ability to hide under ground and then suddenly come out - holy shit, sometimes i'm almost getting heart attack after that. Brr
---
I've decided to myself that any gun that costs &lt;150 caps (estimated, not vendored) goes for scraps, otherwise it's not worth to drag it to Sunny/whatever. Steel +.
---
I'm gonna finish the Morgantown event (supply drop) every time it pops up for cloth (100 pre-war $$ is nice). Cloth+.
---
I'lm gonna farm in private world to have my own pool of junk.
---
Buy it from vendors, the plans.  
---
See here [Fallout 76 Plan &amp; Mod Database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GSBbydRo8dbqZP0iXdGXg3RYat8k4qljPcW50tR_El8/edit#gid=540561335) under Machined tab.  
---
You can also get the plan as a rare drop from events or treasure maps.
---
I think I did this for the first icon they gave us, ever since then it's back to my trusty Nuka Cola cap after claiming the newest one.
---
Hey as long as it works
---
Feather dusters, hoes, loose screws, bone shards...
---
I've gotten the no damage bug multiple times, usually after playing a long time.
---
That one I haven't gotten, but have gotten a bug where it loads the wrong ammo and won't let me fire or reload and tells me "missing required ammunition", so I have to swap weapons until that one fixes itself, or I swap weapons with a hotkey and doesn't bring it up or let me swap to a different weapon on a hotkey, so I have to open my pipboy to change weapons.
---
Try the ammo converter for shits and gigs- it locks ALL controls on PS4. You have to literally hard quit the game to menu.
---
I have been running some tests and I think so far it's more like a ddos attack sorta if the weapon has a lots of different things going on plus ffr and you have fast internet fast pc console ECT the game can't keep up with the calculation fast enough it gets overwhelmed so you get the high damage like the other person said this has been in game for awhile just gone unnoticed until recently I don't think Bethesda can fix it. Just my opinion tho.
---
Cool, I had never noticed that Nukes and dragon had sections for mutations and addictions.Cheers
---
Be the change you wish to see in the world
---
glad im not the only having problems with this  
---
my standard SS under armor stands out so much with my camo SS armor and i dont like it lol
---
VW still sales Jettas in the US? Havent seen one in here in germany for ages.
---
Danm, that's fucked up.
---
Ok.  Was just hoping someone had the answer, rather than waiting on the ticket respond-o-bot to issue a scripted canned response that provided no answers to the inquiry, as is the usual case.  Thanks.
---
You can file a support ticket to get a refund if the item doesn't work properly. But based on past experience, it will take 7-10 days to get a reply after the initial confirmation where they ask you to repeat exactly what you already told them in the ticket
---
She mutated twice on me tonight, I still killed her in under 5 minutes but it costed me extra ultracite ammo, was kinda of annoying. During the second mutation the music stopped than restarted, than she did her dance until I killed her, so that was convenient atleast.
---
&gt; This is costing you as a company
---
Quite the opposite, this model has been proven to be far more profitable. People like yourself with expendable income will buy it regardless when it's around, and to them it doesn't matter if you buy it now or in 2 months. Meanwhile, having that limited timer will get a lot more people to buy it who would NOT have been guaranteed to get it
---
I feel similar to radscorpions, every time they pop out of the ground I waste at least 1/2 of clip from of ammo from button mashing cuz I'm spooked haha
---
Ad Victoriam
---
Yes! Lmfaoo
---
TIL that melee weapon noises can expose your cover if you‚Äôre trying to be stealthy, I never thought Bethesda would go through the effort to implement this mechanic
---
Hm, well in that case, 76 is just being it‚Äôs usual buggy self.
---
Out of nowhere a mirelurk king appeared and destroyed the other three.
---
Last night I did 3 queens, almost everyone was standing on top of a fence or the tent. she landed and stayed on the ground like normal.
---
Could be melee.
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=kYqbkb1_3i0
---
This guy deserves more subs and no I'm not affiliated in any way but he's really informative without being annoying and seems like a nice guy.
---
you might something there, i heard that on the Joe Rogan Podcast so it must be true
---
I can tell this is going to go horribly wrong.
---
The wut?
---
Well there can only be one overseer anyway I suppose!
---
Well, 4 man team made it to the end, me and the guy in power armor survived in the flames at the end.
---
Yeah there's about 10 posts a day about that bug
---
Vendor bots and cap stashes are a good easy source of caps, pick up everything and sell it, some outfits are worth more than others but pick up golf outfits, straight jackets space suits and ranger outfits if you see them, bulk junk to sell and off load excess chems to them, the perk pharma pharma will mean you can get more out of medical containers for more to sell. Kill graffton monsters they drop 15-20 caps, I kill the one by Poseidon while I‚Äôm in the area doing the energy plants cap stash run, then head into Charleston where there‚Äôs 2 cap stashes on the fire breathers exam run, keep following the river past the Charleston building and another graffton will pop up, you can then clear enemies from Wade airport for 20 caps reward and they are super mutants so they drop caps on their bodies too, then you can go over the bridge to do the riverside cap stash run, from there head to whitesprings there‚Äôs cap stashes and the ghouls drop caps, if your lucky you‚Äôll find a few odd caps in the washing machines in the laundry building,  from there you can go to black water mine as there‚Äôs 2 cap stashes there. You can look up all the cap stash runs online and make your own route taking in a vendor along the way to offload things like assault rifles, combat rifles etc (around 30 caps each) and also any workshops, you don‚Äôt need to claim the workshops just clear the enemies from them for the 20 cap reward if your passing them on your route. Formula P, charisma bobble heads, sweet roll, and grape mentats and hard bargain 3 will get you better vendor prices. With charisma buffing aid items and hard bargain 3 I can sell mutation serums to vendor bots for 500 caps each so if I see serums selling in player vending machines for 100-200 caps il pick them up and sell them off to the vendor bot for more. Mothman egg omelettes are worth making too, I collect 28 eggs from mount pleasant and with the super duper perk turn them into enough omelettes to usually net me 372 caps or thereabouts, again with hard bargain and charisma buffs. The chef vendor at whitesprings sells the sweet roll recipe if you don‚Äôt have it and the Enclave medical wing should have the grape mentats recipe as grape mentats and sweet roll will help boost your charisma and get you better prices
---
I was literally thinking about this yesterday in the moth man event ( forgot what it‚Äôs called) and couldn‚Äôt remember the phobia. Absolutely nasty! And what‚Äôs worse, some people get off to that shit too.
---
And have kills on NPCs/players, if not the full amount, at least give the rest of the team a little XP.
---
And on top of that, so long as you stay in the match until your whole team is down, give placement XP based on how your team did, rather than Solo.
---
As it is; the scoring system promotes lots of selfishness. Risky fight ahead? Just ditch your teammates once their engaged, you'll get more XP for surviving longer while they die. Stimpaks? Better hoard them. Ammo? Hoard it.
---
It's like, yeah, once you get a team willing to work together, winning is easy. But the mechanics discourage most players from ever even trying teamwork
---
As long as he doesnt grief other players with it why do u care so much? Ur all jealous aint ya?
---
Scrapper is going to be a must have for this event, pick every weapons and amors, scrap them, and turn the shit in.
---
Take off Bloody Mess perk when fighting radtoads.
---
What level should you be to run the silos?
---
Interesting.  I did the exact same but l logged in 15 mins after reset and didn't crash.  Maybe its when players log on and the game crashes that causes this?
---
Thank you for posting this! It has been bothering me for some time.
---
Its a feature.
---
This is what I don't get, people are like oh I'm a bloodied build I can't collect...... What? I am too, I collect and defend but I defend near the tunnels none of that hiding in the middle room crap. I don't get people who can't take a diluted radaway/rad x and collect. If your build is so dependent on having 80% rads exactly then you should reconsider because you're a pain in the ass to play with.
---
Eeeeh; when your actually looking, golf balls are hilariously *everywhere*. So much so that it's annoying for someone like me who actively despises is from childhood
---
Thank the "dummies" for keeping your selfish ass from failing the event because clearly you can't be bothered to collect
---
Easy fix, Ghouls and Scorched should always spawn anywhere as hostiles, without exception.
---
There's no situation I can think of that either are friendly.
---
If you're having ammo trouble I recommend wearing the excavaitor PA and head to lucky hole mine and gather all the lead ore you can. Then head home, apply the ammosmith and super duper perks, smelt all your lead ore into lead scrap and make 1000s of ammo rounds.
---
If you use V.A.T.S., go for a Suppressor's.
---
Ideally you'll want a blooded 25 faster fire rate 25 less vats cost. But that will cost much more than thousands, it most likely will not sell for caps.
---
You will have a hard time finding one for caps in general, unless it's like an executioner's limb damage or something like that.
---
It really depends on your build though.
---
thatsthejoke.jpg
---
Just add one stair at a time to an existing foundation block and scrap it before repeating that five times.  The whole camp building system in this game is royally fucked up, and is the reason why I don't spend money on most camp items in this broken game.
---
Back when I made my second character I wanted to pick an icon that would tell other players what sort of build I had, but for some dumb reason it's the icon for your account not your character, so I gave up on that fast and stick with a generic Vault-Tec logo.
---
Sounds like "the battle that never was." seemed like a great event. Sad it didn't make it past beta. That'd be the only pvp I'd be interested in, it would split the try hards up so others might have a chance haha
---
Yeah you're better off buying the plans bud. 
---
At least if you do get the plans in future Encrypted events you can just sell those on
---
I just want more enclave stuff in general. Sucks that I feel obligated to participate in the BoS community event to earn the rewards even though I feel like my character wouldn‚Äôt work with them well
---
No, no, kinda
---
Scrip
---
Little better than scrip
---
Meh
---
Yea sadly it seems the flavor of the season is King of the Mountian BR crap, I think call of duty and fortnight have beat that dead horse long enough
---
I blasted through the game in a week, hit level 68, (double XP weekend) and I‚Äôm effectively burnt out on it. Completed all main quests and dropped a nuke. Won NW a few times. Don‚Äôt know what else to do. I put like 50 hours into the game in that one week because I had corona virus and was home with nothing to do.
---
My advice is to really take it slowly and don‚Äôt keep the radio on. Really immerse yourself and take it all in.
---
IF you play full life you can go for :
---
AA/25/25 OR AA/25/15 OR AA/33/15 OR AA/33/25
---
IF you are afraid of death go for :
---
V/25/25 OR V/25/15 OR V/33/15 OR V/33/25
---
IF you play bloodied low life go for :
---
B/25/25 OR B/25/15 OR B/33/15 OR B/33/25
---
IF you play Junkie go for :
---
J/25/25 OR J/25/15 OR J/33/15 OR J/33/25
---
EDIT : IF you don't understand what i said, ask i explain more
---
Did they know you were nearby? If they did that may be why.
---
I read that wrong for a second
---
My bad on the order. Did it on phone and I wasnt aware it was not going to keep the order I set it to
---
Go to burrows or west tek with a turret and sneak behind it swing weapon look at bar movement. Easy to test because surprisingly despite powerfist and death tambo being audibly noisey they are just as silent as a sledgehammer and I think the combat knife but I have not tested that one. One of the weapons that's audibly noisey and actually is NOT silent on swing to my knowledge is the super sledge. I imagine continuous weapons like ripper/chainsaw/Mr handy blade are loud but they aren't my style so I haven't tested em. And if your too lazy to test yourself angry turtles video "best two handed weapon" has a segment which shows off different weapon noise levels perfectly 
---
TLDR: Wrong death tambo is near-silent. Test yo stuff fam.
---
To add to this, I have found it at Lewisburg station many times for people.
---
edit : wrong
---
JSS worth something too.
---
not ultra high value but...
---
Gattling plasmas arnt magic. Their fire rate is much to low
---
Ight, learn sometin new ig. Always figured it was my tambo breakin my stealth since my agi is high enough to make anything else not matter, but thats good to kno.
---
Edit: just to add tho and its anecdotal i kno, but iv never broke stealth in west tek with my cultist blade and everything else the same.
---
More broken shite from this POS cash grab company.  I wouldn't count on any of this crap working from the start or ever being fixed.  They will just bury it in more broken feces as time goes on, and keep asking for more money, as long as people put up with it...
---
MOOoooOOOooOOO
---
What?
---
Yeah I dont understand...
---
I had a furious fixer once, it was really good automatic, also had a instigating fixer that was good for semi auto one tap kills.
---
I hate nuclear winter but I played it enough to unlock that skull icon while trying to get the Halloween and Xmas shite, I rather like that one.
---
you are totally right :)
---
Not being able to target shite in vats is pretty damn detrimental to my B3325 handmade build, so this event is always annoying to me. I wanna do it because I think Enclave Events have a chance to drop the Scout Masks, but the non hostile enemies are very annoying.
---
I would say that it kinda depends. On your build and your luck with gear. I've met ppl that ran their first one below 30. And others that couldn't do it at over 100
---
An assaultron (or waifutron according to some ü§îü§î) pet might be op but so cool! :D
---
I agree. This sounds confusing and I want answers, not sleep
---
If they were screenshots, you can use the xbox app
---
I Sell legendary weapons for 100 caps per star and armor for 50 a star and you can't keep your vendors stocked. While I might not ever need a lead pipe but if it's only 300 caps I'mma buy it for script bc it doesn't weight much.
---
go with raiders. settlers suck...
---
I'd love a super shotgun skin for the double barrel.
---
That's the one I was mainly trying to do but a bunch of people said the benefits with the settlers are better
---
Yeah, that should be a given. I forgot to put it in my reply.
---
Talk is that a big balance update is coming.
---
Although, this has been rumoured since release lmao
---
Tunnel snakes Rule!
---
Im 125, i am a PA and heavys weapons build, i use a prime gatling laser and can power through the silo in 20 mins tops, i have healing factor so you just aim for the head, then hide, no need to waste stimpacks
---
Do both questlines up until you get a warning that continuing will lock you out of the other faction. 
---
The settlers can give you the Chinese stealth suit for free, but besides that their storyline and characters are lackluster. You can get the gauss shotgun from them too, though. 
---
The raiders have much better stories and characters, and you can get the gauss minigun and ammo maker from them. 
---
Siding with one over the other doesn‚Äôt completely lock you out of the other faction; it just auto fails any quest you haven‚Äôt done with the other yet. So do settlers at least to get the stealth suit, and then (personal opinion) go with the raiders.
---
[I made a post like this too.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hu2uwn/dark_matter_skin_and_other_combat_rifle_skins/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) 
---
Bethesda actually replied to it too, I think they said on another post they‚Äôre planning on doing this, won‚Äôt be next update but it‚Äôs something they‚Äôre going to do.
---
(I also added links in my post to other similar posts, this one included.)
---
If you put a splitter on it maybe?
---
ok, so, first you should know what build you want to play.
---
1. Full life
---
2. Vampire (restores health when you hit an enemy)
---
3. Bloodied (less than 30%life)
---
4. Junkie (addicted to 5chems or more)
---
After,
---
AA is for anti armor (good DPS for queen and other big armored monsters and regular dps for little monsters) (only usefull for monster that have big armor)
---
V is for Vampire it restores your health when you hit an enemy. you can't die if you have ammo.
---
B is for bloodied. (Ultra high dps, but high risk to die) best DPS in game used with stealth.
---
J is for Junkie. +50% damage when you are addicted to 5chems or more. good dps, can be full life, have con and pro.
---
the first 25 is for ffr25 or faster fire rate increased by 25%.
---
second 25 is for 25AP cost reduction.
---
15 is for 15r or 15 faster reload 15%.
---
33 is for +33% hit chance in VATS / SVAV.
---
All these perks are usefull for sneak build.
---
price are listed something in this order :
---
B/25/25 &gt; B/25/15 &gt; B/33/25 &gt; B/33/15
---
Same for AA / V / J
---
Ask again if you want more :)
---
EDIT : Viable and cheap options are :
---
Mutant if you are mutated.  instigating &gt; Furious (it's mostly situational for I and F)
---
Do both until you get the message that makes you choose one or the other.
---
Thanks! This should help me understand what I see in the Xbox lfg posts. If I have more questions I know where to go üëç
---
Only if its explosive. And its hard to make it work since it has to only hit 1 limb.
---
The splitter on a no explosive gattling plasma turns it in to a flamer with a shitty hitbox . Its pretty garbage on a non explosive flamer
---
Laser because ammo.
---
I require them now
---
Ah right.
---
So far I'm at the point where with the raiders, the quest says to tell them I'm ready for the vault. With the settlers I'm at the point where I go to the 7th hole. Will there be like a legit button that asks if I'm sure or is "tell them you're ready" the warning?
---
Not bragging or anything but when you have good gear and know what you‚Äôre doing it‚Äôs really not hard to make a ton of ammo. 10k isn‚Äôt really that much. Do you really actively look for people selling that much to try and catch them cheating? I made 30k 2mm just the other day. That said I doubt anyone will get banned for doing this, let alone the person who buys ammo from them.
---
Poggers
---
Hope they actually do it
---
I keep only one in it just for this reason.
---
nothing is free
---
the free icon make you browse the atomic shop and then it auto applied so you have to spend even more time in atomic shop to pick a new one.
---
IT VAULT-TEC LEVEL GENIUS!
---
And of course it‚Äôs someone from WV!
---
Nice! I'm a stealth commando so I only really use unarmed with a stealth suit now. Pre-Wastelanders i  did PA with two handers. It's mostly experience talking for me since I don't want to come across as a know it all asshole cuz I'm not :p. But yeah it's surprising how the tambo literally jingles yet it's about the same as a sledgehammer. While super sledge is full on loud... it's just bethesda being as inconsistent as always.      ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
I had 10, now I have 3....
---
Do not trade threw the lfg page. You will get scammed.
---
That sounds like it has a back story to it as to why you'd want that.
---
Currently it's not a skin, so no shielded SS mods
---
It's a crafted atom shop under armor. All of them so far are in the casual group. This one is not, in fact it's not in any group so it can't be modded.
---
So to summarise, it just works.
---
Yes, please!
---
Not sure exactly how the achievement/trophies work, but I guess they are from quest completion.
---
Coop is a bit awkward sometimes. Firstly, when you are in a group, if you are all close to each other everyone in the party gets loot from enemies that you kill. But to get XP from kills, everyone needs to do a few hits to the enemies.
---
When it comes to quests, much of the Wastelanders content is in instanced interiors. Your friends can come with you inside your version, but they will also need to do it themselves afterwards (you will need to switch around with who is party leader if everyone is going together all 3 times).
---
The original storyline didn't have instancing so that's easier to do together.
---
Make sure you join events that pop up while you play - many are a decent source of XP, and especially at lower level it's a good way to get aid items.
---
Watch out or he‚Äôll come for you next! Better lock up your purified water
---
100% agreed with Nathan\_TK
---
U gotta complete main questline with them and afterwards try to farm rep mainly with this faction bcz of final rewards. the gauss shotgun (awailable at max rep with settlers) is cool but it is so buggy.  Anyway I oneshoted with this gun everything but flying SB  (btw crazy OP GSG works 50/50 only in VATS).
---
Just get a cryolator and play support. Youll get your damage in and people will be thankful too.
---
Edit: ill give you a fixer plan once youve shown me you have a cryolator and at least 1000 cryo cells.
---
Yes, we‚Äôre all jealous of someone who has to cheat. You got us all, now return to the bridge from whence you came troll.
---
Check Noclip documentary there are spoilers and potential future content.
---
Gat laser fed with ultracite cores due to ammo availability when made with super-duper (or was it ammo smith?). You can get up to 6 ultracite fusion cores every proc and with power user those cores will last a good clip, even with ffr. If you need depleted fusion cores for crafting ammo, watoga has several power armor chassis around. Always long barrel &gt; charging barrel. Just point and hold fire until it's an ash pile.
---
I do however think the gauss minigun will be better damage overall, and with the correct barrel should also be 'magic' since the shots count as explosive. Regardless though the gauss minigun devours ammo, which makes it seriously cost prohibitive. I have a 2-shot that i keep just for queen/colossus fights because it shreds.
---
No, I make sure they're not cheating before I spend caps there. I regularly have upwards of 15k for sale and would welcome anyone to do the same with me, because I don't cheat. But yeah, I report people like this when I see them, because if it were an intended mechanic, then Bethesda wouldn't have locked an inferior version behind a reputation system, and everyone deploying one understands that.
---
After getting all the useless legendary run rewards. Imma just save my scrap for stuff I‚Äôll actually use.
---
Agreed! We are getting some cool new items for QuakeCon, why not just continue that train of thought and apply it to weekly items. I hardly ever look at other people's icons, so it is ultimately a waste in my opinion.
---
Just do them both to the point of no return, then pick a side.  You'll still be able to max reputation with both, and get all the crap from both factions eventually.  There is no real choice here as you can still do daily quests for both and buy all their plans.
---
Ya my bloodied gauss mini is overkill for everything in the game, it even shreds the scorch beast queen. That thing guzzles ammo so I only use it on super tanky targets, you almost have to prime it to keep up with ammo cost
---
They‚Äôre very boring imo. Normal ones are more annoying than the Queen
---
Hurry and get through that phase. Once you've gotten the SSA you wont need it anymore.
---
Good idea! I been hoarding all the workshops in preparation for the Atlas event, I will be sure and look out at train stations. Good idea! For the Brotherhood!
---
Ok yeah I get that. Just seemed odd when I thought you were actively searching for the cheaters to report. I‚Äôm pretty tired so I‚Äôm sure I read it wrong
---
Aight thank you!
---
Welcome to modern online gaming. You must play the game nearly every day to get all the rewards. Skill is irrelevant - how much time you‚Äôre willing to sink is all that matters.
---
Charleston one is the smaller one. Harper's ferry is bigger.
---
While Settlers suck, they do have Gauss shotgun plan, I sided with Raiders but doing it again I would side with Settlers to get shotty first, better than minigun IMO :-)
---
That's OK, Thank you!
---
If you are lucky enough to find a legendary hunting rifle that does double damage when the enemy is at full health you are golden. That with a 50 cal receiver, silencer and a full set of non-auto rifle and stealth damage boost perks is the best you can get. depending on your level you'll be one/two shooting most things.
---
I used to have a bloodied ripper. It used to fucking shed things. When they fixed the bug that made melee weapons do more damage when over repaired it became useless, so I dropped it somewhere to free up space.
---
Now they're an extremely rare legacy üòï
---
I have the triple barrel and the tesla coil added to the gauss mini gun. Would that make the gauss "magic" as well?
---
My shovel definitely does.
---
Happened to me too. Was saving my first nuke run for to do with my girlfriend. I was on last night after she went to bed and someone in my public team launched one....Mission completed .. why is this a thing Bethesda?!
---
Meta time here, you can get both sides up to right before you enter Vault 79, and you will want to do the settlers up to that point to get the Chinese Stealth Suit unlocked (otherwise you will have to pay thousands of gold to get the plans the slow way), after that the objectively better choice is to go in with the Raiders and get the Slug Buster named plasma rifle that is inside. This gun is only available to the raiders and will not be in the room for the Settlers, even if you glitch into the room to look for it. It is also morally easier to keep all the gold for yourself and not pay the raiders when it comes to the end. After that you can do the dallies and get both factions up to max relation to unlock all their plans. This will take a long while, but it is the end game grind.
---
I did not use my perk cards between approximately levels 50-120. So I sucked at surviving, killing, scrapping etc. Because I did not have a specific "build". The game was really really hard compared to now. Hahaha what an idiot! (I still have 92 perk cards I can pick and 10 packs to open at level 231)
---
It looks like the Crashed Space Station was originally going to be in the Cranberry Bog instead. Guess they put it in the Toxic Valley because otherwise that region would've had absolutely nothing of note.
---
The challenge where you need to craft one of each vault 94 armor
---
Something I didn't know I wanted but now I need aha. That's a great idea.
---
I saw him yesterday and he didn‚Äôt have anything new or interesting...the only thing I didn‚Äôt know was an under armour. And I don‚Äôt think I have the the rad trap
---
I had closer to 40K when I checked earlier today
---
Looking at those numbers I‚Äôm doing my part with ease.
---
Got plenty k of mats in my scrap box.
---
Sentry or assaultron already got a raider protectron
---
Clearly, wearing a mask or something over your face doesnt work. ;)

Over-decorating. I have a living room that‚Äôs gorgeous, but it took up like 80% of my budget.

If you‚Äôre ever on the same server, I‚Äôve got a heavy weapons build but will run for ore in that event (PS4). I did so yesterday and managed to collect ~30 ore.
---
I see what you did there. üòä
---
I'm not sure you can I'd things stay the same. Either way, I'm in the same boat as you, and I'll probably have to throw aroms at it.
---
Man it looks boring...
---
I used an AA 10mm SMG on the Queen last night, it was doing 8 damage per hit without commando perks. My Gatling plasma only does 6 with all 3 heavy gunner perks, so they are useful. It shreds yao guai‚Äôs and fog crawlers too
---
Toxic foodbuilds thats what u re! Go cry ur self to slep because someone got "better" gear then urself.
---
Fckin greedy toxic people. mimimi
---
It‚Äôll be nice to offload some of the 87,000 steel I‚Äôve needlessly hoarded away.
---
Playing with my GF for the   first time right now and it is a great COOP. However, only the timed world events are shared with whoever is there. Quests have to be picked up and completed individually.
---
The main thing shared is all of the combat, and the loot lying around that isn't in containers. The new NPC wastelander areas CAN be entered as a group but only the leader gets credit. The best thing to do in those areas is everyone enter solo, which is easy to do as it is a separate button, no need to leave the team. This also allows everyone to make their different choices too. The one thing I found a bit annoying is if a teammate picks up a quest from a note or holotape they need to let everyone know to get it, or quests will be out of synch. So just make sure everyone pays attention to the new quest popups, and inform each other.
---
Every time I win, I realize the payoff isn't there. As soon as you win, you're back in the lobby like everyone that lost, with little extra to show for it, spare a memory that you're not really sure if you earned, or others gave away.
---
The Ward of prefabs.
---
I don't get it, what are we looking at?

Hwat? How bush wookies breaking anything? ;D
---
Gt?
---
Thanksgiving shelf, white skull sign, red wallpaper, etc.
---
Or is this really the reason our neighbors aren't getting the mail with power armor on?
---
French mani skin for my deatclaw gauntlet is still my favorite idea but I‚Äôd also kinda dig a slocum joes pink and yellow paint for it
---
I've been using all of mine for various things just to keep it manageable, but lordy I'm gonna have to start a collection again.
---
I found this out after i done 4 mods last night was like dam it wasted some of my junk. Its good to know for the next time it pops up tho.
---
Ah shit I‚Äôm gonna be gone from the 2nd to the 9th. Does everyone get the rewards of everyone contributes?
---
Where did you run into him if I may ask? I‚Äôve been patrolling his routes for a week now with no luck
---
Finally... Someone with the guts to call out a buggy bungalow.
---
sentry bots weakness: stairs  or non flatten surfaces
---
sees your comment and then looks at my 9000 cork and 11000 plastic in my scrap box. Damn he's absolutely correct.
---
What‚Äôs that boy, are you trying to speak?
---
My camp is just south of the Whitesprings Train Station, on the train line before it goes up into the cliffs. He was on that stretch of freeway, before the ghoul spawn if you‚Äôre heading south from the Whitesprings entrance. But I‚Äôve been camped there for months, and it‚Äôs only the second time I‚Äôve seen him. The other time was outside the train station.
---
Given their past records i‚Äôm afraid they‚Äôll never fix it.
---
I've gotten to the point where I'm almost used to jumping through the side of my bungalow to get in and out oO
---
I've been doing bloodied, and most of what I do at RR is ore collection.   I only stop collecting when it looks like I don't have enough time left to get to the next level.   However, I've also stopped at 25 ore (level 1) if there were only two of us and we needed to keep those scavengers alive.
---
I don't have any problem staying alive at this.   Chinese Stealth Suit, Rad Shield, and a few diluted rad-x/stimpack.   I use a relatively good weapon, something that takes out ghouls in a few shots.   I have Glowing Sights and Serendipity equipped, fwiw.
---
I don't understand why multiple people can't keep at least one scavenger alive while I'm down there getting ore.  
---
Where I do have trouble staying alive as bloodied:   Scorched Earth.   It's enough to make me think I should just clear out the rads and put them back on after it's finished.
---
Every time I think I'm going to stop wearing the sheepsquatch mascot headpiece...
---
Luck 36
---
Cool man, I feel them alive and close
---
In addition to that, Power User in INT will take those cores from 500 shots to 999 shots each
---
I still have loads of customers, but I price stuff to move. Personally I wont bother with trades - I dont want to be organising meeting someone at a specific time, organising a 3rd party courier etc etc. I'd rather just throw it in the vendor and be done with it.
---
I go shop at someone else's camp because they're showing 20 weapons. Get there and realise why - they're all pricey junk. I'd rather shift something than have it sat there hoping someone is going to pay 20k for it
---
I ran into someones Sofia Daguerre the other day. Far away from any camp location and fighting two Yao-Guais. I took them down to help her and she then disappeared somehow...
---
I've never ever seen anything in any of the containers.
---
EVER, there's always been nothing in them.
---
It's either a bug, or intentional for some sort of Todd Retardation Control of the gAmE eCoNoMy
---
I believe for the "magic" to happen, you need to have 200 fire rate or higher
---
Were I to ever sculpt a radtoad I'd keep all its eggs in. it only alleviates the issue a little, but it's better than nothing.
---
Don't look too closely at the trees in the mire.
---
Not trypophobic but I notice these things. My issue is clusters of stuff, which SHOULD make the eggs in the toads' backs worse for me but doesn't. When they start coming out I feel a little grody though.
---
I love when people lock the door on the bungalow. Not sure if they're having a laugh or not haha
---
I'll call my Eyebot "Sputnik"
---
I feel like number of active players is significantly lower than 500k. It's even worse if the resource pools are per platform (i.e separate pools for xbox/pc/ps4).
---
Per steam charts  [https://steamcharts.com/app/1151340](https://steamcharts.com/app/1151340)  there are barely \~10k active users on PC. I fail to see how console numbers could account for the remaining 390k.
---
there's also person number 4:
---
&gt;I have 100 million of all scrap, that's chump change
---
&gt;you want some guns while I'm at it?
---
Either they really don't know how to manage radiation as a bloodied or it's just an excuse.   I tend to think the latter because it's pretty simple.   Or wait....are they low-leveled bloody?   Maybe they don't have the Chinese Stealth Suit yet.   I wouldn't want to gather ore without that.
---
Ah yes, the duper. Forgot about the that person.
---
You can grab 3 or 4 at a time to turn in. Empty your inventory of any tech documents and pick up 3 or 4 and then check your pip boy, it will still just say technical data like you only have 1. The only difference from grabbing 1 or 4 is you get 40 caps instead of 25 so I always just turn in one at a time and I‚Äôve gotten all the BOS power armor skins and shielded under armor plans
---
Playing co op with more than two people can really suck sometimes. 
---
On the bright side, yes you all get the achievements as long as you're all doing the same quests.  
---
You can all gang up on enemies.  You can all get seperate loot from dead bodies. This is especially good for when you encounter higher level enemies and wanna just lob grenades.  
---
The negatives. You dont share exp automatically on kills. So you and your friends constantly have to communicate on tagging the same people otherwise the exp is going to be split and someone is bound to fall behind on levels. 
---
You dont share "overworld" loot. First person who picks it up gets it.
---
Big ouch
---
Yep most got to keep all items too.
---
which ones?
---
Yeah that's a good idea. I'll try doing nothing after the robot first and if that doesn't work, try the photomode. Thanks!
---
Thanks, will try again. I was using the same armor, but not that melee weapon. I need to get one of those. I often use the large deathclaw.
---
Yeah I did the ammo factory thing, totally regret it since you can‚Äôt even move it let alone delete it.
---
There‚Äôs multiple power armor skins, Knight, knight captain, paladin, elder(I think there‚Äôs 2 more I can‚Äôt think of) and the shielded BOS under armor. I‚Äôve gotten all of them but I used to turn in at least 5-10 a day because I wanted the elder paint, it was a serious grind
---
How is that even possible though like wouldn‚Äôt his camps budget be taken up?
---
Wrong sub pal
---
You have to be on a private team with them, I‚Äôve had a bunch of griefers destroy my camp when I joined a private team
---
Can't have guns without ammo to go with it too. 
---
What about stims and nuka quantums? I'll toss in some bobble heads too. Hey, I have some porn mags lying around. Can't have an apocalypse without em mags man.
---
That‚Äôs cool I‚Äôve been trying to get the glitch to work for the past 5 and a half hours it‚Äôs 1:30 in the morning and still haven‚Äôt gotten I even bribed people $20 through PayPal in builders public group and no one came sadly
---
i don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll follow us around, they‚Äôll just be at camp. that‚Äôs too hard to create in an online game. all kinds of crazy player made spawn points all over the map would make the game buggier than when it first started.
---
I have what I guess you can call a elobrate base. Two buildings one three floors high and the other two. I'm near hornwright testing site 2. Very bottom of the map. I should be fine considering the Only players who have came to my camp have all been plus 200 level.
---
Unless she's a Bard, and Inspires you all...
---
You have to change it to the ammo you want every time you log back in.
---
Are we gonna talk about mothman eggs? I try my hardest never to stare at it for any amount of time.
---
My only gripe is that the rare plans are random screw that that is really annoying as rng for the good stuff is stupid considering you could donate lots and still end up with nothing rare, should just be you donate enough you get the plans
---
I sided with settlers. I helped a friend do the raider side and the quests seemed tedious and boring. The settlers quests are boring too but much more straightforward.
---
Others have given solid advice.  One word of warning though is that choosing the raiders you are more likely to experience bugs during the vault raid.  It's possible that you will have to do it multiple times if you get hit by any.
---
This is my legendary farm route but I would also add harpers ferry, sometimes I run the burrows but it‚Äôs really hit or miss
---
Ad Victoriam, hail Elder Maxson!

Wait what, when did they say they'll add pets?
---
&gt;Got a real nastygram yesterday after we killed a guy who stole from my teammate's camp and had a wanted bounty on him.   So.....   I guess it's okay to play the part of the game where you steal from people, but it's not okay to play the part of the game where you kill wanted players.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;He should be glad one of our other teammates wasn't on with us.   That guy.....well, he doesn't stop at just killing you once, especially if you like to send hate mail.  (Love ya, F\*, if you happen to see this.)
---
I've submitted a ticket for refund, it's a waste of time to wait until they'll fix it. Besides, I can barely see the difference with camo and "clean" SS underarmor with full set of SS camo armor, so it's not really necessary...
---
I don't think anything about it but this was such a funny post! Thanks for the laugh hahah!!

Lmao I completely forgot about this

If you're on XBox I think that we'll have to wait till most gamepassers reach level 50 so they start purchasing level 50 armors and guns. In addition to this they are always broke AF
---
It's not very distinguishable from default color, so I'm not very excited about it...
---
This comment is w/o any thought and sense.
---
F1ster use their private server because no one else could take the resources there. And picking up 180 items is a breeze, you can run one farming route over and over. 1000 concrete? No prob within an hour.
---
no. we also need a mr. fuzzy-colored one and a  pink sprinkles one
---
I‚Äôve heard similar lol. I‚Äôm not even saying they should nerf bloodied, just buff some other legendary effects !!
---
Awesome, thanks! He sure is phantom like for a fellow so green and bulky...
---
Report ‚Äòem.
---
Remember that time where you could just loot an NPC to get their stuff instead of having to pay real money for it?
---
They do not produce eggs from those holes...do they...............
---
They are kind of already doing this by making events that require you to kill a specific creature. Example, need to kill mole miners? Do Lode Baring. Super Mutants? Jail Break. Legendary enemies? Radiation Rumble or Uranium Fever or all the other ones. The dailies are incentivizing people do to events but not forcing them Complete X Event, that would be kind of lame.
---
What cosmetics exactly? I‚Äôm always low on caps.
---
Are player following pets something they definitely announced that is coming? I am out of the loop if they did!
---
While the current system on the Queen is far from perfect it is better than it used to be.
---
Early on you only needed to shoot her once to get loot, like all other legendary enemies in game. This caused people to come in, shoot her once and then hide in the bunkers / run away from the fight and let 1 or 2 people handle her (to save ammo, be lazy, leech etc) . This was the norm. Whole server would come in and 1-2 guys/girls/others would do the fighting while rest were afking somewhere nearby. And a lot of the time the 25min timer would run out and Queen would fly away. This would naturally not happen anymore, since player power has increased alot since the early days.
---
But current system is better, not perfect and needs some rework, but better. Figure out how to do more damage on her with your character and it will be ok. Queen is meant to be the end game of this game (sad isn't it?) and therefore people fresh from the vault should not be in there in the first place, until they are ready.
---
I ran round Charlestown once, I could hear him, and I could hear Chally but he was a ghost....turns out he was inside the fire department garage at the back
---
"The whiners"
---
People are not "whining", they just understand that Bethesda clearly promised all gameplay additions would be free, not cost 100$/year.
---
The more holes the bigger the gangbang.
---
Rambles on and on like a mental patient, mostly
---
Back to this again? I tried to upgrade it and it wouldn't allow me...even for standard version.
---
Nah the dupers got this. 
---
Thanks btw
---
This usually happens if you uncap your framerate.
---
Raider vault raid is buggy and some people report having to restart it multiple times, didn't have any trouble on Settler myself
---
Galaxy brain: Liberty Prime skin for Liberator
---
Lol, I‚Äôll have a look there too. Cheers mate!
---
I'm wondering if it's worth moving my camp up close to the observatory. It's gonna see quite a bit of foot traffic there very soon.
---
Yes, prices have collapsed.  In-demand things will still sell, but you may have to sell for much less than fed76.   I agree with dhking's observations, adding that even treasure maps have stopped selling.   They used to sell like hotcakes for 75 caps each.
---
Not sure why people are downvoting this comment, Fallout 1st is a promise breaking scam and always has been
---
What are you waiting for though üòÖ?
---
They are both S-tier weapons and shred everything so really it's just build preference imo
---
You didn‚Äôt miss out on the story, you‚Äôll still get the same rewards for launching a nuke yourself.
---
No, if it will be moved to misc you won't be able to store them in the scrapbox - I currently have around 3500 fluxes (total of all colors) and without scrapbox I couldn't store fraction of it...
---
Are you able to use it in NW?
---
What about the guy running from settlement to settlement trying to brokers alliances and deals with raiders, settlers, enclave, brotherhood, minutemen, and vampires? What about that guy?
---
It's me, I'm that guy...
---
Your Gatling Plasma is pretty good
---
Not great, not terrible, I prefer my B33FMS one though ;)
---
I can't use fallout's built in vsync because with my 13 year old 60hz it creates nearly 2 seconds of input lag, and causes extreme stuttering even with using Radeon Anti-Lag and other radeon perks. Do i have any other options?
---
Is it still up in your challenges?
---
I moved my camp next to wayward shortly after wastelanders and I‚Äôve seen a ton of visitors. This may not be a bad idea.
---
That‚Äôs me or building enormous houses. I have to remind myself this isn‚Äôt Sims. üòÇ
---
Like popping a fat zit or a a hole left over from removing a bot fly larva... *Shudders*
---
It's a glitch but not really am unheard of one.  There have been a few glitches that would allow repeating faction dailies.
---
THE WHAT
---
And pls dont forget the tank with babymirelurks üòé
---
No neat would be if the emote was especially tidy
---
I miss ED-E
---
Melee weapons are always better as bloodied, because you can have close to 40 str with a unyielding bloody build.  Swing speed is a must for any melee weapon for DPS.  Bloody , swing speed + 1str is the perfect weapon(imho).  This is okay, maybe get 1000 caps for it. (also niche for a bloody/junkie melee combo player so could take weeks to sell) 90% scrip
---
Bloody gatling plasma is no better than a one star bloody gatling plasma except you do 50% dmg when you miss and hit a limb.  1-5k tops.  I bought a one star for 3 K but haven't sold one for even 2k for a while. (it was the first bloody heavy weapon I had seen on a vendor after coming back post wastelanders, and then 3 dropped for me in a week) 60% scrip
---
Tesla rifles I only use to tag mobs as I'm not specced for them and they are great for farming events without one shotting everything on accident.  Rifle players want either DPS (bloody FFR) or the ability to one shot something (instigating,bloody,stalkers).  100% scrip
---
More budget? üò≠ I have a camp I'm proud of but inside it's pretty bare cus no budget.
---
Glad it's not just me. I thought my game was messing up when I couldn't upgrade it. It looks really sweet with a set of camo-skinned sturdy combat armor, a green beret, eye patch, and wastelander breather! I'm glad we at least have the gray one!
---
I kind of like the charcoal black look but it's still not v exciting, would still get it to match my guns
---
I‚Äôm glad to hear that! Always nice to have it go smoothly - It sounds common enough and I‚Äôve definitely had some instances where it seems like shes targeting someone not on the ground so just continues to blanket attack... fly really far away ... blanket attack again... rinse repeat. 
---
lately I‚Äôve noticed she takes off very soon after landing - can anyone enlighten me maybe there is a reason for this like staggering while in air prevents her from landing?
---
Agreed. And thank you.
---
Thanks for the offer. But this would kinda feel like cheating to me.
---
Luckiely, I found a level 25 pump-action exploring the ash heap yesterday, plus some combat-shotties for more mods. So I should be set for a few more levels.
---
Not sure about the final build yet, but I was planning to go neither bloodies nor junkies.
---
A few days ago, there were three of us left, including myself and a teammate, who had ended up approaching the circle from opposite sides. 
---
My teammate  promptly dropped a nuke on the circle, leaving themselves a sliver of room to survive in. They coincidentally nuked my position. I sprinted toward them,  but got caught in the blast. 
---
Switching to spectator, the sole remains other player popped up behind my teammate in the tiny sliver of unnuked ground, and emptied a clip into them.
---
I haven‚Äôt laughed so hard at this game in ages - poor sod had to have carried that nuke for ages, and the only person they killed with it was on their own team!
---
(In a happy ending, they somehow survived the ambush and so won the match, which is as close as I‚Äôve ever been to winning a round of NW)
---
I just skip to the next server tbh. I'm done wasting my time rebuilding my camp over and over again because of the way the camp placement doesn't always work.
---
Good choice.
---
maybe sound proofing so they can talk inside without would be snoopers?
---
I always do. And most of the time I'm like, really? You took my camp spot for that shabby shack of a camp? You limp noodle
---
I can sell alot for 555.
---
I would imagine that if any fallout 1st types were inclined to over harvest in anticipation they would do so in private servers where it had little impact on everyone else
---
We can probably cut those numbers into a fraction once we factor in the dupers with millions of each of those stashed away
---
I also have an issue where if i run on Vsync everything is blurry. Any idea about that?
---
Plans for the light, sturdy and heavy raider armor pieces have a very low chance of dropping from the following quests and events in the Savage Divide:
---
Signal Strength
---
Uranium Fever
---
Guided Meditation
---
(Edit: also treasure maps)
---
I'm surprised some of the little lean tos I see aren't made of mud brick and thatch honestly.
---
I‚Äôve noticed this recently, a few servers I‚Äôve been in the last week or so we‚Äôre just horribly buggy like enemies glitching around and vendor menu not loading, it‚Äôs a nightmare. I usually just server hop to one that‚Äôs smoother
---
Dude, a liberator would be awesome and would totally fit my Commie Spy aesthetic.
---
Recon scope and beam splitter
---
AD VICTORIAM BROTHERS!!
---
I think all 3 animals have to survive the event to get the plan. Im not sure but i only received it that way so far.
---
I have one to spare if ur willing to trade for 5.56 and ur on pc.
---
Did it yesterday, and indeed it was a great source for shotguns and shells. Went out with more ammo than I came in.
---
Just a bit frustrating that I can hardly damage those level 40 glowing miners. So I basically just tag them and wait for the high-levels with their explosive gatlings to shred em...
---
Based on the way they worded it yes. The items should unlock for you, players gone for the unlocked Score double dailies or second meat week will miss out on those select rewards.
---
Kindergarten playground logic
---
That's going to require a shocking number of golf balls, globes and baseballs.
---
Its almost like some of these are intended to make dupers dupe stuff...
---
I chose foundation but because during the missions before, the raiders were always insulting me. Even the most random npcs if you walk close to them they insult, who tf they think they are! lol so yeah.. i got pissed off üòÖ
---
No. R.I.L.F. for me, please.
---
Sometimes they will bring back free items that they gave out in the past, but usually, it seems to be select skins/items or icons.
---
Till bugthesda fixes magic (bugged) weapons you can join them or miss tags or spread the word hoping for mercy and all the bugged weapon users you come across are nice people and hold back enough for you to get a tag in.  Owning an anti armor weapon just for this fight and colossus also will help.
---
You can yes.
---
They must have flipping shouty shouty voices to need that much cork
---
you get 700-1000 lead in 5-10m this way, note it does require 200-300 acid per run to smelt it all
---
Wood, scout, marine and T-51 PA are the types available. You used to be able to favorite things that weren't available in NW, but they changed that in an undocumented update so people wouldn't be confused. No one knows why the ghillie skins aren't available, could be intentional or could be a bug
---
I‚Äôve added the odd head here and there but didn‚Äôt know u could blueprint and use those. Maybe make me a couple of displays and blue print them. Some bases just need a little bit of decoration üòâ
---
Isn't there like a limit per person on what you can give per day? That would prevent dupers (if it is true) saw it mentioned in another thread that there is a limit of 100 per person
---

---
there is probably a duper somewhere with 200000000 cork
---
when everything goes right we cant find junk items all over the map. Rip collecting something during hoarding event. At least private servers exists. They probably doesnt use cork , they need only annoy you to prove loyalty ...
---
Exactly, that's what they do. They are there when there is no event. Honestly, this event seems to run the smoothest for me. Most of what you complained about had nothing to do with the event.
---
If you‚Äôre on PS4 I can build an entrance for you, or teach you exactly how to
---
Maybe that's why it's not a skin for regular SS armor, because only Casual armor types are available in NW for some reason (lazy is what I would assume is the issue)
---
Are you wearing a complete set of excavator and both legs modded?  If u are then it‚Äôs a bug I‚Äôve never experienced. Mine carrys 440
---
At least they kept that lore right since Jet hasn't been invented yet in Reno with cow poop.
---
Head to the deep and you'll find them
---
Nothing wrong with that! Tag away and one day you'll be the one shredding while other people tag! Glad you got yourself some shotguns, just run it each time it comes up and you'll get loads to scrap for mods.
---
Poo Thief!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
If there isn't already there will be if the "rare" plans are worth anything
---
Lol. They were there first. Bethesda doesn‚Äôt choose üòÇ
---
WHAT
---
IN
---
THE
---
CHEESE
---
COVERED
---
FUCK
---
You had to move again to fix it didn't you? Like go to the atomic shop, turn the skin off, then go back in game, and move your camp? 
---
I mean that's what it takes to make the skin appear so...
---
God damn it. I dont want to move AGAIN.
---
Do you have a backpack on? Or deep pocketed armour? You loose those boosts when you get in pa
---
Edit, or any armour pieces with +1 str
---
Don't need modded legs - the bonus is applied automatically by wearing the suit itself. My suit is 100% mod-free and I get the bonus.
---
I‚Äôve had 110 at once at workshops the other day
---
Why would you rebuild? If you stay for a minute, your camp will still be there on the next server
---
do you need the legs to be modded to get the full +100 bonus? I thought thats what the armor comes with and the legs add to it.
---
I know u get a carry bonus but I thought the 100 was with the calibrated shocks?
---
Does any of your regular gear have Pocketed or Deep Pocketed? Because any stat increases from gear gets removed when you wear PA.
---
I know you said otherwise, but are you *sure* sure?
---
No. Excavator gives +100 with just the full set. Then you can get another +100 with calabrated shocks, 50 for each leg
---
tons of fucking ultra light combat armor, it‚Äôs the brotherhood of steel, not the brotherhood of slow...
---
Could be a glitch, you never know. The other day I saw someone with a handmade with a Sheepsquatch staff sticking out of the gun. I saw it clear as day on my end for a while, but the player said he just switched from his Sheepsquatch staff to his handmade. On my end the two were merged together for a solid minute.
---
Lol was this on ps4 I have 5 of his twin brothers hahaha
---
Depends in your playstyle
---
Hmmmi just checked. Yep it should be 100 increase. Are u wearing Uny armour at low health or have 1 strength on armour or under armour pieces. U lose those putting on the PA
---
Well the issue currently is no mod sticks to it. Not casual. Not SS. Nothing.    
---
    
---
I always thought that in fairness Atom skins should take all mods.
---
200 with calibrated shocks
---
&gt; backpack on?
---
I do but when I take it off my bonus carry weight is only +90, again assuming it doesn't stack with marsupial
---
OP, sniper builds in this game are obsolete unless you have a bloodied lever action. It works better than sniper rifles in game. The damage really isn't fair. I started experimenting with Bloodied after Wastelanders came out and it is high risk, high reward. For full heath builds you need tons of ammo and kills for leveling. Bloodied, not so much. I hated it too for a while and still do when it takes clips to kill  something that Bloodied builds do in a few rounds. So I use both builds. I'm a tank normally but leveling &amp; killing enemies is so much easier in Bloodied. You definitely want to go automatic with a handmade or fixer. For full heath I use a quad FF handmade (85 rounds in a magazine), in bloodied I use a bloodied FF handmade (25 rounds). Real life...sniper would be top tier for sure!
---
Well, you get access to the rewards, such as the new BoS stuff, when we pass the milestone.
---
...and are then banned, having fallen into Beth's clever trap.
---
No.
---
Standard suit is +100.
---
Calibrated Shocks add another +50 to each leg modded.
---
I doubt they will get banned
---
That cant be right. 200 million at 100 a player. Would take 285 thousand plus players a week to fill. Or ten weeks with 28 thousand plus. Not happening
---
It dose stack with marsupial. Marsupial always give +20 carry weight. No matter what else you have on, unless you took a rad x.
---
With that amount of cork it will be the Brotherhood of Dedicated to Making Sure The Titanic Disaster Never Happens Again
---
What system are you on?
---
Yeah I see that. Only thing I can think of is armour, under armour and backpack bonuses you lose when you put on the power armour. So if u had 20 on a back pack you‚Äôd only increase by 80 for example.
---
I do, because mine is in a weird, difficult to build in place where people never tend to build. I'm always curious how they used the space.
---
Whinging about pets when the game still has crashing issues and cheaters (like those with the ammo machine from the Ammo Factory in their C.A.M.P)
---
Couldn‚Äôt you just drop a nuke yourself? It‚Äôs the same as the mission.
---
Lol, got me too.
---
There isnt any. Except getting f76first to get the unlimited scrapbox
---
It is a very loud nightclub
---
I always thought those are their eye holes....
---
It used to be 400...,,
---
Get fallout 1st.
---
I want a betsy wandering round with my house or with me
---
Marsupial, speed demon, and healing factor are almost universal. Any build.
---
If I‚Äôm being honest you‚Äôre not missing much from that mission but that‚Äôs my opinion and my memory is a bit blurry on what I did in that mission
---
ü§£
---
I'm not worried about that, I am confident that they will implement some kind of massively counter-intuitive interface, daily limit, time sink, or other garbage that will ruin things for everyone.
---
Probably, I have no idea what i need to do in the mission nor how to launch a nuke. If it has some stories or context, i just want to experience that mission. I don't know if there is much difference doing that mission or launching a nuke. Want to experience the last mission of the game that i have poured so much time into.
---
it was my underarmor thanks for the help!
---
Yeah, kinda boring, just like the other clandestine paints. I'm inching towards the Atomic Onslaught skin. Looks much more interesting to me.
---
I'd name mine libby
---
We all do
---
No not really. Just something we'd like
---
i can guarantee it will happen isn‚Äôt it unlimited storage with premium?
---
You still have to do the same things, get the keycard, silo codes then do the silo run. So should be the same set up.  If you goggle the walkthrough for that mission then you can just follow the same steps. Hope that helps.
---
I want a maid outfit on her
---
Brotherhood is going to start the first appalachian vineyard and winery... It lines up with their excessive need for glass as well.
---
Chateau Atlas, PinoT-45 Gris, Charred-onay Ghoul?
---
The cuteness of a pet Liberator cannot be overstated.
---
this is no glitch. its one of the hacked weapon types being around.
---
Oh and we will watch the fires
---
I don't know how this event will be held, but I think it'll be rather collecting item that will appear during the event, like stuff during Meat Week or Wood for Fasnacht event. So if someone with whole needed amount shows it just fulfill requirement for the event (i.e. 100 required) and that's it.
---
Thanks for the input, yeah even if it isn't that great i just feel like i can never complete the game now.
---
Whether you have that quest or not, you'll have the same experience going through the silo and launching a nuke. So you're not not really missing out of anything game play experience.
---
Also, when you get to the point where you are going to clear a silo and launch a nuke, I recommend doing the process of finding the code yourself. I used this guide for my first nuke and it was quite fun,  [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oaUl4-kVH53KdwAvBBWvnETBby6R98pAF0iIvgPsogE/edit#](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oaUl4-kVH53KdwAvBBWvnETBby6R98pAF0iIvgPsogE/edit#) . Once you find the code, I'd check at NukaCrypt that you got it right so you don't waste nuclear keycards.
---
Pretty sure you will be limited to deliver like 100 daily per character or something
---
You can always drop a nuke yourself it never changes it‚Äôs been the same way as always
---
You can bet your ass they will give them skins, it's too good of a money making opportunity to pass on. They seem very very VERY into making money with this game specifically.
---
You don't have to change your build at all. There are no energy specific perks. You might want battery's included if you don't have it. And power user will double the amount of round for a gattling laser. But that's it
---
Edit, and you'll want the mini if you're specced for heavys already
---
Now why would I go resource farming in a public world?  Think it through instead of being ‚Äòknee-jerk mad‚Äô.
---
I choose the raiders and split the gold, but the raiders are still mad that i didnt gave all thr gold to them XD. So unthankfull
---
(I can still trade with them and do their dailies, so dont worry about that. I Just get mad remarks thrown at me)
---
Do you have any idea of how item respawning works?
---
These are the most common scrap on the game. If you‚Äôre so worried, start stocking up now 
---
Stop being ‚Äòknee-jerk‚Äô mad and rhino it through.
---
Id rather have robots like these be part of an actual update ala automatron where you can build your own robot.
---
Then either have them hang around your camp, or some new "exploration" feature were you send them for hours/days and will come back with whatever they find.
---
1. Yep, probably they won't do anything here - every patch they claim to improve stability and stuff, but crashes still happen - yesterday my game quit to desktop 2 time within 10 minutes and then I was able to play another 4hours+ without any problems
---
2. I don't remember they ever said anything like that - CAMP budget were increased after Wastelanders for everyone though.
---
3. They're adding more content to existing world (new events, BoS, Legendary Perks etc.). I'm not sure if adding completely new world part would be a good idea...
---
I said ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù not ‚Äúthe good guys‚Äù. Being good or villain is different than being interesting or boring.
---
You sure find the oddest things to worry about. 
---
That‚Äôs not how the last community events worked.
---
FO76 is sometimes stash management simulator - you must live with 800 lbs. Or buy F1st for a month, move all the junk there and feel significantly more stash space available ;)
---
selling my BE harpoon and dropping my early legacy weapons from early on.
---
not need
---
They should. They did with ESO.
---
Would make it more fun than going to the same interiors over and over
---
I do not he same thing. It is very rare for my location to be taken so I have to see what is there.
---
You can in fact tame a possum, I have one myself! But sadly they die if anything even sneezes on it.
---
I would say clean out the box, no need to hold onto items you do not intend to use. If you are casually building things you should be fine with 100 or each scrap and should be able to replenish supplies quickly enough.
---
Won't matter for me, I'm away for the entirety of the first round.
---
so depending how many players playing and actually delivering? Its only 4 days for  125,000,000 Steel that is 312 500 collecting players every day... and there is  also 200mil of cork. = impossible numbers
---
So heavy gunner perks work with energy heavy guns to right?  
---
Thing is I think I heard that the plasma caster is way better, is it considered a rifle? My main is a .50 cal because I dislike the spin of the minigun
---
On a side note what ammo does the gauss minigun use?
---
I'm really sorry if I seem oblivious. It's because I never payed attention to wastelanders weapons..
---
Good to know.
---
Now I have something important to do in the Game.
---
Thanks mate.
---
Because you don't have fallout first and you need to make your ammo, need to build your house and try and get some of the great plans(fomo). I think those that think it is easy probably have fallout 1st and don't have to manage scrap in ways that others do. A shotgunner alone goes through thousands of shotgun shells and it takes 10 plastic for every 21.
---
I ran out of steel the other day making a suit of power armor, and again trying to make my third RNG roll on "probably" SS armor.
---
In other words even at high level I have run out of all resources listed.  I also think that the majority of players are not 1sters and would like to participate, but can they part with the materials they may need, even that play session?
---
Even if the goals are met very early, it won‚Äôt be acknowledged. Bethesda manually update the tracker, and will do so in such a manner to suggest steady but not huge progress, with some last day tension to try and get everyone to really push and get us over the finish line. The entire community could do nothing and this narrative would still play out.
---
First, you need the secret service chest and jetpack. It can be done with power armor and a jetpack, but you don‚Äôt fly nearly as far and are always fighting against gravity. Since you still take fall damage and mid air damage while launching yourself without power armor, you need to make sure two pieces of your armor have the 50% fall damage reduced legendary perks. These can be hard to come by so just use a trading sub to source two pieces. They don‚Äôt have to also be secret service, I have leather armor for those two perks. Other than those two pieces of armor, make sure everything else is unyielding. The stat increases help with flying and seem to really make a difference in whether you‚Äôre on a smooth easy flight or fighting against gravity. All this takes trial and error, but this setup has worked for months. 
---
Now that you have the right armor, the jetpack, marsupial and bird bones, maybe stranger in numbers on a team, you‚Äôre ready to fly. You can build springboard traps at your camp or in workshops. I always just use workshops since I‚Äôve been over max budget for some time and can‚Äôt build anything else. Build a foundation with some stairs going up, like 3 or 4 stairs, then a floor piece. For the springboard trap, just make sure you‚Äôre using the bottom one out of the available two. The top one only opens up 90 degrees and doesn‚Äôt fling you correctly. The bottom trap opens 180 degrees and will fling you properly. Once it‚Äôs placed, just go into third person, stand on the very back of the trap, go into first person, then activate the trap. Then just switch back into third person so you can see and boost at the right times. It just takes a small boost as soon as your character kinda levels out mid air. Again, just have to mess around with this to get it right. And if your setup is correct you won‚Äôt take any damage mid air or when you fall. 
---
Here‚Äôs a video to show it in action. It blows my kind this isn‚Äôt more common knowledge, but it does take such a specific setup so i kinda get it. https://youtu.be/nbYemhMfq3E
---
Something like the Ammo-Computer xDDD
---
5 klicks for 20 Steel
---
that's exactly what I was thinking.
---
I agree about speed demon and marsupial. Healing factor doesn‚Äôt heal during combat and reduces chem effects, so I think it has questionable worth. It essentially saves you stimpacks when the fight is over or when you use rad away. It doesn‚Äôt save your life during a fight. I use it to reduce rad away effectiveness for my bloodied builds, which don‚Äôt need full stimpack effectiveness.
---
if you can't beat them join them
---
All I really want is to open few Vaults that are already in the game - add some lore, add some quests to them, F76 miss soooo much of Fallout feeling without ability to explore vaults.
---
Long before FO1st came out I had no issues gathering materials. Even after FO1st came out, people had no issues gathering materials. 
---
You‚Äôve run out of *concrete* and *cork*?  What the hell are you making?
---
You ran out of Steel?  Go do Uranium Fever, collect all the weapons, throw on Scrapper and walk out with about 750 Steel.
---
Scavenge what you need before you need it, and then use it accordingly.  Scavenge with a plan and you‚Äôll be fine.
---
It was mentioned in the ITV in the quakecon section. It's still coming out next week.
---
With public teams now a thing i have herd mentality on every character.
---
Pretty sure the actual tricentennial edition is confined to a single use code to prevent this from happening. I haven‚Äôt tried it but you can certainly try at least?
---
Is a J FFR lmg a magic weapon?
---
Its a complete grind. If you want to deliver over 6000 steel every minute, go on. And what about cork? Millions of cork, seriously?
---
Yes heavy gunner cards work with heavy energy weapons.
---
The plasma caster is a heavy, but it acts like a rifle. I personally don't like it. The rof is super slow and its hard to hit anything with it.
---
Gauss mini gun uses 2mm
---
Yeah
---
It is?? Why are they hyping up the ATLAS content so much and not the new boss? Also, does that mean Legendary perks next week as well?
---
What were the other perks?
---
Plasma caster, gatling lasers and guass minigun all use the same heavy guns perks as ballistic versions so you don't need to change those. The guass minigun uses the 2mm emc ammo and ohhhh boy does it chew through it, I would only recommend it as a boss killer because you'll run out of ammon super quick otherwise.
---
AD VIC-FUCKING-TORIAM BROTHERS!! TAKE MY MATERIALS!!!
---
That's great, now we need pics of other people having a Fallout 3, 4, NV, Tactics, 1 and 2 all lined up next to each other.
---
I've been playing since wastelanders every single day I'm level 340 and I have amassed 30k steel in all that time and I have 1k cork in all that time. Sorry, I can't see us doing those number.
---
You can. With a springboard trap and the right setup. You pay by claiming a workshop, then build the springboard and launch yourself to anywhere else on the map.
---
 And the magic is dealing a crit and it continues to crit, correct?
---
Can't apply shielded lining to Camo SS Under armor either i hope they fix it by next patch.
---
Are you using the future tec camp?
---
Put a dense mod on your chest piece. It's helps significantly
---
There is a lady in one of the buildings at Watoga who is really into robots. Like in a sexual way.
---
I guess because we've know it's been coming for awhile now rather than the new event which is new information. Also legendary perks won't be till the next big patch after this one, think it was September or something.
---
It‚Äôs annoying how actually dousing an ally in flames does next to nothing with the ‚Äòfriendly fire‚Äô perk. The card shows them literally holding a flamer ffs!
---
This patch has made it so when I click play on steam nothing happens. The game doesn‚Äôt even attempt to launch. I‚Äôve updated windows, I‚Äôve updated all my drivers, and I‚Äôve verified my game cache. Short of reinstalling it I‚Äôve tried everything. Anyone else have this issue?
---
Wut?
---
No. The magic is hitting 1 limb and keeping a stream of fire on that limb. It also has to do with server lag so it's not always going to proc. I find it really hard to proc with an lmg because it kicks so bad. I have better luck with a ult gat laser.
---
Try the filthy casuals sub
---
The CAMP missing on map issue happens if you use the new CAMP machine skin that is rewarded from the legendary run.
---
Also, there's an update coming on Tuesday and they usually bring along a bunch of bug fixes.
---
Hope the dupers have us sorted cause I'm a dedicated player but I've amassed the grand total of 1k cork in 340 levels and I'm a horder.
---
i think 400k active gamers is a very generous estimation.
---
Ah. Alright. Yeah, makes sense but still...
---
That sounds more like a lifestyles sub.
---
üòÖüòÖ savage!
---
I guess Cork would soundproof against scorchbeast screams....
---
If you use imgur you can post a link with your pics here
---
Nope. The hats are not rare
---
Nope
---
HUNDREDS of millions of cork...
---
But in any event, I very much doubt it will matter.  Bethesda has, presumably, access to internal metrics and know how much junk is being recovered by the player base.  It is unlikely that they would choose numbers that are actually unattainable.
---
Further, it isn't likely that the numbers actually matter.  It would lead to unhealthy speculation on the state of the game if the goals weren't reached.  It would also likely lead to accusations of "being set up to fail" and what not.
---
I suspect that all goals will be successfully reached, whether or not anyone actually contributes anything.
---
And finally...what the heck do they need two hundred million cork for anyway?  Wood, steel and glass make some sense...but cork?
---
I don't need weapons or armor or plans, what i am looking for is .308 ammo, but barely anyone has it.
---
You need to cap it in your gpus software. So either nvidia control panel or the AMD equivalent. You may as well just cap it at 60.
---
I got my atoms back for it. So they must know something is up with it.
---
Oh, you.
---
Ah, I was waiting until I got the Jangles backpack. But I might be using a demonic fuzzy for a while!
---
Are we playing spot the cheater because my money is on you
---
\- remove all ammo you don't use
---
\- remove minerals from misc section
---
\- no more than 200/300 of each scrap
---
it is good then, if we clear it in minutes, best community ever. Duper takes, duper give
---
I‚Äôd wondered when that would be starting. 
---
I‚Äôll be happy to store things for people. If you have scrap that you want stored, message me and we‚Äôll meet up sometime Monday.
---
Oh of course that is a good point, oh well just need to be careful not to die and stash my scrap.
---
I have a mothman church at my camp :)
---
Other than the actual Chinese army, technically no but the Mama Dolce‚Äôs company was a facade for communist spy outposts. 
---
Anything else remotely ‚Äúclose‚Äù to communism would be Fallout 4‚Äôs Institute at a stretch, since they act similarly but not with the same principles so again not exactly a communist faction.
---
I know my response might not have been helpful but I hope it sets some light on any factions that might‚Äôve been.
---
Scrapping 3* handmade somebody dropped for me as a noob and now I can't find one miserable.
---
Give it a prime coil and start making ultracite 2mm. Otherwise you will run out of Steel and lead, no matter how much you might have it.
---
I feel you, it's a bit disappointing to be not be able to complete it yourself on your own terms
---
No worries, it was my comprehension of your comment that sucked you were fine üëç
---
*Eyes shift side to side*
---
I see... that's very interesting.
---
However, exploiting is wrong! Bad player! Bad! No! *smacks*
---
*Boots up private server and spams fast travel on Crater*
---
What about an Enclave scavenger bot with a Modus display for a face.  It would find science scrap
---
Yeah, I mean, it wouldn‚Äôt hurt to nerf bloodied abit and buff others abit. 
---
TS is garbage on my main lol
---
I‚Äôd want a ferret even though they‚Äôre not in fallout.
---
"It just works" was a slogan Todd Howard used to promote fallout 4, it's currently associated ironically with his games because they have so many bugs and problems
---
In other words, it's broken and bugged like dozens of other things in this game
---
Empath and heard mentality
---
Soundproof the base against screaming flying bat's is my best bet haha.
---
That will be my plan from now on, I get caught up in the moment and forget to move.
---
Me, an intellectual: sure, I'll support these morons and then exploit them, steal their secrets and technologies for The Enclave.
---
LONG LIVE AMERICA.
---
I like this idea. I keep hoping that they do more oddly specific dailies also, like that tadpole challenge to cook 10 meals with a chef hat on, or that one mission to kill a Wendigo in a clown costume.
---
100% yes ! It was trash at the beginning, but now its amazing !!!
---
I envy you that you can start now
---
1) sounds like something bethesda would do but I also have no confirmation 2) its a community event with community rewards, even if a duper spoils the whole thing because item 1 was false, you still get the rewards, 3) the fo1st scrapbox only theoretically allows unlimited  storage of SCRAP, but to really maximize that youd have to fill your stash with other stuff and add all your scrap through the scrapbox and is more trouble than its worth imo than just dumping it in
---
I prefer T-60quilla myself
---
TBF I drink enough wine IRL that I could prob donate that much cork in a year's time
---
You need some calibrated shocks
---
For rhe Scout quest i have to revive someone on my team, which seems difficult to organically do. Ill Have to organize someone offline to help complete that one.
---
I got my copy when wastelanders came out for dirt cheap and it‚Äôs my new favorite game, there‚Äôs some bugs here and there but it‚Äôs such a blast. I highly recommend it for any fallout fan. I can‚Äôt wait for the new brotherhood of steel content coming out this winterü§©
---
No it‚Äôs casual players of the game...
---
All of them.
---
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY CAPS!
---
With class freak the downside is non existent. As soon as you are done killing. Full health. Easy peasy.
---
Filthy casuals is a great sub
---
Use a shovel, it makes a satisfying "ploink" when you wack 'em.
---
I would shop around, see if you can get it cheaper. It's a great game for sure, but it's still a Bethesda game, and it has its fair share of issues.
---
It's definitely fun, but not ¬£35 fun.
---
Your probably fucked. Anything thats been free and came back to the shop has taken over a year.
---
As long as we are adding features that allow us to know what we are buying better, can we also see the full names of items in vendor shops? A lot of times I will see a long string of adjectives, but then the name of the actual item is missing. I‚Äôm really glad that it is in unyielding something or other, but I really need to know what part of my body it goes on.
---
Don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a daily limit. You just head on over to atlas and drop your stuff in a chest for Russell.
---
I mean its a really big building, still seems excessive  though
---
Recently this has also started occurring at workshops with spawned waves, every so often.  Haven't noticed it too much for it to be an issue, but it exists.
---
The goals are at least x million so I guess it won't matter too much if dupers drop millions of scrap on Dorsey.  Everyone else will still be able to donate as far as I can tell.
---
Maybe you just crossed the daily reset time? For the daily quests it's 6 hours before the "real" daily reset - afaik.
---
You are not missing out on anything. There is no special mission version of launching a nuke. It is the same experience every time. 1st or 23rd launch, same process same waypoints.
---
Buddy. Youve wasted alot of time and resources
---
I wonder if this type of phobia is ancient or just a more recent social phenomenon. And most phobias in general...
---
You can actually dodge nukes with power armour, the animation to get in and out of it makes you invulnerable so if you time this as the nuke lands you won't die.
---
this is the first time I've heard the term "ghost turrets" and I know it's just a shitty glitch but that just sounds badass
---
Hahahaha
---
Modern problems require modern solutions.
---
If your happy with your current rifle then I'd push for 3*,if not then 2* till you get a good drop then change to 3*.
---
One thing you can do is to add :  
---
\[General\]  
---
bDisableAllGore=1  
---
in your Fallout76Custom.ini under Document -&gt; MyGame -&gt; Fallout76 (if you don't have it just create a new text document and name it Fallout76Custom.ini)  
---
This will disable the visual effect caused by Bloody Mess on all creature and maybe help you a bit with that.
---
it‚Äôs just a code
---
If that happened, then maybe BGS would actually f%$king do something more about duping.
---
Right, who am *I* kidding.
---
Haha yo Maxson, you want a fixer? I got legacy lasers as well...
---
Huh, pretty sure he just used the disc but thanks for the heads up
---
https://uk.webuy.com/search?stext=Fallout%2076
---
Just saved you ¬£20 and you‚Äôll feel less upset if you don‚Äôt enjoy it. :) After these two years it‚Äôs definitely improved and I play almost daily now so it‚Äôs likely you‚Äôll be happy or at least satisfied long enough until the BoS DLC arrives.
---
They certainly insist on the date and time of the purchase from the Atom Store, which is really nasty as we have (as far as I know) no record available of our purchases from the store, so this is a good way of diverting players requests for a refund.
---
I just never keep a record of everything I click on to buy just in case it is another lemon.
---
All assets, all the stuff from atom shop and legendary run, as well as pre order stuff is linked to your account. Redeemed once, it will not be possible to register again.
---
Well crap, I thought I was doing well at 26k steel. 30k?  I tip my hat to you sir.
---
But yeah, I think 1st users will.have a great shot at all rare plans if they want them. I don't really care about the beret though.
---
my underarmor has +2 strength (+10 carry weight) forgot about underarmor when checking, thanks for the help!
---
They use cork inside their PA to prevent chafing...
---
I heard on Howard Stern that the Joe Rogan podcast causes gynecomastia
---
True it wouldn‚Äôt hurt, encourage some other builds !
---
afik pets are only camp items like the npc's, no real companions. or do i have wrong infos?
---
It could be fun if you had it, and every NPC you came up to coughed and put on a gas mask.
---
What about a horse or cow to carry our junk
---
I think more people are generally playing more - doing events and legendaries - as they work on SCORE.  I know myself, I play semi-casually, just logging in every day for an hour or two, but over the past month I have been doing so much more in the game than what I used to do and as a result I am constantly full of meds and more legendaries than I can exchange some days.  Before SCORE I used to buy cheap legendaries just so I can trade in for scrip, and now I don't have to do that -- maybe that's a part of it?
---
You can get into NW and then see your daily
---
A sentrybot would probs be too bog to travel around with you.. but i mean it could stay at your camp
---
Wait they're adding pets? That's pretty cool might have to come back to the game at somepoint then?
---
Its because of the explosive bullets perk
---
I'll gladly change the skin, thank you for the information.
---
save your scrip for modules/sales and buy a 2\* on the trade forum
---
If you have an explosive flamer it starts to shoot single shots instead of flames
---
That would be awesome if dupers, just to troll the system, completed each donation challenge the first day it started.
---
Yeah, someone just replied saying that skin makes the camp vanish. I'll change it and hopefully get my machines back open.
---
I want a scorchbeast.
---
I doubt there is actually a "limit" to the amount that can be donated.  This isn't something they would program into the code but rather something that they would come in each morning and check the logging on.
---
And of course, I don't think it ultimately matters.  It would look very bad (at least to some people) if the goals weren't reached.  There would be calls of "there are so few players they couldn't reach the goals" or "Beth has the metrics so they intentionally set the goals at unreachable levels so avoid having to actually cough up the rewards" and so on.
---
I'm sure that no matter how much or how little is collected, the event will run for the specified time, will accept all junk in whatever amounts are provided and in the end it will be announced that all goals were met and the rewards, such as they are, will be forthcoming.
---
I dont get it are we guna have another bs event like cleanup appalachia. They had no way of tracking that accurately. We all might as well take a well deserved week break when whatever this is drops and just soak in the rewards at the end of it.
---
There‚Äôs the main community reward but also individual rewards for turning in the scrap, possibly rare plans and other items
---
12pm EST every day or in the UK, 5pm
---
2am in brisbane australia gmt +10 everyday,
---
it‚Äôs the vendors that reset 20 hours after you last used it
---
i wanna see it before i go in
---
They're both Magic! Keep 'em both!
---
Oh ok yeah thats annoying then
---
disc has no different content
---
Happened to me the other day. Had to move my power station to somewhere remote in my camp for it to work.
---
Ad Victoriam !
---
Gauss Minigun is also Explosive, which *doubles* the fire rate, making it Magic!
---
Yup! It's an absolute beast!
---
Marsupial and speed demon are a must have for any build. But I also use adrenal reaction and herd mentality for both my build and talons and the other melee mutation(can‚Äôt think of name) for my unarmed build
---
Assaultron make my peepee hard.
---
It's sad when you can see whats happening behind the curtain, but yeah, pretty much this.
---
Hell yes an eyebot would be great my favourite Eyebot was Ed-e from new vegas
---
I fucking love that robot
---
5pm bst or 4pm gmt
---
Chuck the Tri Barrell on it and you will now have a *magic* weapon which will absolutely melt anything!
---
well i played 800 hours without 1st. And then when i went into self isolation for 4 months so i don't die i thought i'd treat myself. I shall be cancelling it when i go back in a week though. And i still farm stuff daily because i spend about half of my time in this game making weapons/armour and camp items for people. Yeah i have loads of steel and wood. Common stuff. But that's it.
---
 
---
Before 1st though i was already storing stuff on alts by using a friend though.
---
Between 8am - 9am on the west coast of the United States. Not an exact science, but that's accurate.
---
I think it‚Äôs a legacy weapon, BE flamer
---
Sigh... *unzips
---
Junkies makes the weapon *magic*, it'll melt anything with the Tri Barrell installed!
---
I‚Äôm in Arizona and the daily quests reset at 5pm, are you talking about the challenges?
---
There's also at least a 4th type.
---
4. On vacation during the entire first period of the event.
---
Aww yes
---
He uses legacy explosive flamer - it this situation it doesn't shoot flames but flame projectiles. There is no other way to have this effect on non-legacy flamers, you have to get yourself legacy version.
---
And it's RNG. I spent 150+ hours trying to find a red asylum outfit and never found one. I know people who found one without even looking for it. I have also probably bought 2000+ 3* ranged weapons from mumbles (across different accounts) and only ever had one ok fixer yet some people get great fixers straight away. So. There's that.
---
Vendors: 20 hours after you first used them (and did a transaction).
---
Daily *Challenges*: 12 pm EST
---
Daily *Quests*: 8 pm EST
---
I'm genuinely interested as to see whether this reveals just how 'into' the gameplay loop most players are, and whether Bethesda will make future changes to their game design if the answer is 'not very'. I'm a roleplayer and here for the story updates and to take screenshots. I don't Kill&gt;Loot&gt;Return much at all. As in, I can go weeks without scrapping anything, unless I need ammo. If I'm going to loot I dedicate a play session to just hoovering up anything I see and stick it in my Scrapper. Despite having been a Bethesda customer since Morrowind, I'm about as far from their imagined player as can be.
---
I wonder how many other players are the same.
---
Ah I see, apologies!
---
Well yes if you're an explosive/grenade build but I have to run around to find the launcher and they break pretty quick, normally I have to use 2 per Event so yeah, for melee builds it's not ideal but for explosives build definitely!
---
Person 3 sounds like a Communist, the BoS would never let them join
---
Yup! Could see them saying 2M Cork failed, to make it seem real, then giving us the rewards anyways!
---
I assume we've be using Nuclear material to get that distinctive glow and burning-all-the-way-down half-life for the Charred-onay Ghoul?
---
Pff. Y'all with your robobrains and sentry bots. Gimme some of that Motherlode.
---
This should really be a feature and not a bug. Something like there is a chance of your companion showing up during an event if you're not in a team or something.
---
It is absolutely worth it. Especially now. Wastelanders did a lot of good for the game and they are back to adding new content.
---
The Brotherhood of Steel is returning and excitement overall is pretty high. The in-game community is super great and friendly as well.
---
Not going to say it's perfect, but worth it? Definitely.
---
2.5:  "I appreciate what the Brotherhood did for Appalachia, and welcome their help against the Scorched and threats in the region, but I have no desire to join up and play Spess Mahrine with them given I have resources and tech that would make them want to join \*me\*."
---
No worries. If your on Xbox I can calibrate the legs for you later if you like. That gives u another 100.
---
The only difficult part is finding squirrels, it seems.  At least for me it is.
---
Yes I always spend the points! I think the perks were always there, at least since I got the bow plans, just shunted to the end of the alphabet for unknown reasons. They weren‚Äôt even marked ‚Äúnew‚Äù
---
Be careful where you place it. The nearby Mine is a nuke target to spawn the next in-game boss event. I think south-east of ATLAS is safest.
---
Yeah it took me days to find the acoustic guitar plans, turned out to be a type of...chair
---
I read some guy doing that with foundation. Just another perk you get from having 1st ya cuck
---
That's an odd way of spelling *COMMIES*.
---
You might think that but check the one post on my profile üòâ
---
Scrip*
---
BST?
---
War ... war never changes ....
---
The "rare plans" are just going to be the same weapon and armor plans from the present/pale loot table. Thank god there won't be any of the taxidermy plans.
---
I typically do, at least when vendor hopping. Usually switch pretty soon, as my camp is in a mostly central location, and I don't like spending a billion caps just to fast travel everywhere.
---
I started recently and have no idea what is rare and what isn't - need to find a list some day soon
---
Pretty sure these politicians don't give a fuck about karma, bud.
---
Depends on how they work. ESO has pets that follow you everywhere. Though they are purely cosmetic and can't interact with the world in any way
---
I'm always extra critical of those who have camps in my spot. I take a lot of pride in my main camps.
---
No limit, donated in increments of 250. The rewards for turning them in arent really valuable to dupers.
---
F
---
I mean... if I was hacking weapons and someone calls me out on it, of course I wil lie and say some bull hahah
---
Somewhat blunt, but all accurate. There‚Äôs a reason the tracker is manually updated.
---
I would definitely have to recommend an explosive gatling plasma. Easily the best heavy gun
---
I just wish switching builds would be easier :-(
---
Pink, forests, yellow, red asylums dresses, most jumpsuits, urban scout masks, responders fireman outfit and hat that just off top of my head. I had a list some where.
---
Finally, someone with the guts to help.
---
The roadmap has something for Fall, but I have no intel on whether this is only for saving card setups, or if you can actually move points around more freely.
---
They might look harmless but they kick your non-chicken ass
---
I don't think people realise how much stuff is out there. There must be 250+ items in the golf club alone. There's about 90+ on the shooting range at the sons of dane compound. Takes maybe 2 mins to grab those.
---
Also. It's not 180 items. It either changed or they were wrong. Twice now i've counted items in private world and each time i've went just 180 stuff and hasn't respawned (even relogging). Angryturtle on youtube said it was 255. And i'd have to agree. I messed up both times i tried to count but it's definitely not 180 and both times i went just over 255 stuff did.
---
It‚Äôs meant to be, but currently bugged. Description says ‚ÄúCasual mod group‚Äù but I can confirm that casual underlining plans can not be applied to it. 
---
Others have apparently tried to apply the SS underarmour linings to it and apparently can not.
---
you can look here https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/daily.html
---
Checking it and seeing that only the nukashine was missing and all your other crap is still there
---
Do Not buy it full price. I got mine for &lt;¬£7 and after playing 1100hrs+ I still only Like it rather than Love it. 
---
Its improved massively over time and I have  perfect days, but also crappy days, and it can be very grindy at times. The player base, both on and offline, is generally friendly and helpful but you will run in to the occasional idiot and even total (insert swear word of your choice) who lives to make your life hell - server hopping becomes second nature. It's very much a Fanboy vs Hater game. 
---
If you can look past the many bugs, exploits, griefers, questionable developer decisions etc (some more prevalent on some platforms than others, some pretty universal) then it has a lot to offer. If you prefer a smooth gaming experience all day every day look elsewhere.
---
Oh okay I was wondering why it wasn't working. Thank you üëç
---
You and me both bro.  I have some nerve damage in my good hand and when it acts up I can't aim for shit.  Vats allows me to play around this and its kept me loving this series.  Wish Beth would fix the way it glitches in 76 from the bogus missing at 95% to crap like this where an entire event that happens in multiple places across the map doesn't work as intended.  I actually really like this event, enclave is one of my favorite factions lore wise.
---
I was under the impression that the quest is more like some pre-quest/introduction for the three daily quests: The Chow Line, Dross Toss and Lucky Mucker. I have always been able to do the Mistaken Identity once on every character i have, and then after that only the 3 dailies would appear.
---
EDIT: I had to do the challenge on a alt as well. As my main is a very old one and i don't think the challenge either worked early on, or wasn't even there.
---
Oh yeah, not from the UK though, Living in Iceland so we on GMT here still, we don't do daylight savings.
---
Mistaken identity only occurs once per character. After which, you get daily quests whenever you're in the ash heap. They occur in succession. You can visit the area, be assigned the daily quest, but not do it, get all three, and do them all at once
---
Well, you're doing your part
---
Absolutely, meshoppingqueen would visit taht store any day of teh week XD
---
What did i miss now? Whats Fortifying Atlas?
---
Datamining is showing that its the same weapon/armor plans that are in presents/pales.
---
So rare for anyone who didn't do any hardcore grinding or benefited from dupers.
---
I'm level 340 and I'm my scrap box I have 1k cork and I'm a horder too.
---
That would take actually effort while designing and animation characters
---
Bethesda would rather die then do that
---
No. 4 The we fucking hate those brotherhood pussies and want to watch them suffer so theyll get nothing from me people.
---
why would you insult ward like that?
---
It's an explosive flamer
---
Fortunately I can‚Äôt remember the last time I had that issue. My camp is in the middle of the Thunder Mountain power plant lake lmao.
---
True.
---
I was actually mad and closed the game when I saw how poorly the first bartender your meet in the game is floating above her bar...
---
oh man I didn't know this. so I can complete a Biv quest at 7:45 pm and then get another one at 8:01 pm? I thought it was an individual timer like the vendors
---
Can confirm. The underarmor is indeed capable only taking SS linings (got all casual and SS linings on my toon) but they don't stick to it, even if you can craft the lining on it.
---
Oh you got here floating , i had her dead on the floor when i walked in but she still talked with a mouth animation but she was a ragdoll what fun
---
Sounds like we need a freaking exorcism for her wtf
---
I didn't like the plasma caster at all. The gatling gun is so much better in every aspect.
---
The gauss minigun is pretty good, about the same as the other good heavy weapons, but the one downside is the heavy ammo (even after the energy ammo weight reduction perk) that you'll chew through quickly. 
---
The perk loadout for heavy energy weapons is nearly the same for ballistic, the only difference being the INT perk to lower energy ammo weight. If you threw out all of your ballistic ammo, you wouldn't have to worry about the ballistic ammo weight reduction perk (although I never use it unless if I fast travel. I use the energy one anyway, as I use both ballistic and energy heavy weapons, but mostly because fusion cores are heavy and I like to have a lot of those.
---
I can't comment on the gauss shotgun.
---
My sincere apologies! Grab that daylight while you can! HeHe.
---
Theres no room for a real story or plotline in this game. Its just guna be farm this and kill those until bethesda pulls the plug
---
We do , ill get the heavy napalmer !
---
Cool story.
---
Just saying it going to be hard to get those much cork
---
That probably a good idea right there
---
I want a Megasloth as a pet!
---
Aigth!! Gonna charge my power armor
---
Announcement of new thingies to do by Bethesda last night :)
---
We have to help the BoS rebuild the Atlas Observatory

---
They only reset servers manually if theres an issue, most servers are up a day or longer. ( I no from going afk at my camp to keep my vendor open)
---
Gonna get the ‚ÄúSpecial gear‚Äù
---
Holy cow didn't even realizes your name we have an expert over here!
---
Im right outside of foundation, its pretty nice considering about every player in the server has a reason to stop by at least once.
---
Yep the family name passed down for generations!
---
Where did the say that? :)
---
They originally were making those for all mutations. There are concept art pictures floating around the net about the early designs. But since bughesda is only 2.5 billion dollar company they could not afford to make them, or the job was too hard for the interns and office temps they are using to develop and design FO76.
---
Depends how you look at it. If you get a 3*, and it's not the right one, you get 40%of your scrip back when you return it. If you get a 2*, you only get 30%, and a 1*, 20%. On the other hand, say you had max 1000 scrip. You get 10-3* rolls, 20 2*, and 40 1*. Odds on getting a bloodied shotgun or rifle are very slim. Also, suppose you got a bloodied shotgun or rifle, what if you're not satisfied with the secondary perk? It's all like playing the lottery, even the modules (more akin to scratchers). Just have fun with it, man.
---
If you really want to preserve ammo, get a bloodied death claw gauntlet.
---
Well that sucks again proving Bethesdas lazyness
---
No worries bud! And thanks, we kind of have a 6 month of sun (in summer its 24/7 bright outside)  and six months of darkness (Nov -jan almost no daylight)  situation going on here so daylight savings wouldn't help much haha,
---
Id love a liberty prime.
---
Is this ever going to be fixed? This makes players unstoppable because there is no way to see them
---
Discord datamine group. I to have some reservations on the matter but we'll have to wait and see for 100% confirmation.
---
They just want as much money as possible for the cheapest cost and effort possible. They don't care pushing out alpha state games, as there are stupid people (looks deep into a mirror) who keep buying their products.
---
I've always wanted to visit, would love it! I know a few people in bands up there too!
---
Captain Slow would like a word please.. (if you are a car nut and watch James May...)
---
Im on PC sadly, but thanks for the offer!
---
&gt;But as \*agility\* and speed are very important to me, along with ammo conservation because I'm weak AF and ammo is heavy, and because I don't want to hop around like an idiot, those things are unreasonable to ask of me. 
---
So much this, forcing us to jump about like those frogs in NW.
---
If you camp at the iron/steel deposit right side of the road between The Wayward and Flatwoods (just past the Mr. Farmbot) you can have several pets. It‚Äôs a spawn point. When my camp was there I‚Äôd come back to camp and there‚Äôd be two or more animals roaming around the camp. Which animal it is changes. I found squirrels, opossums, rabbits, chickens, redstags, and beavers (my favorite). The rarest spawn there, at least in my experience, seams to be cats. Once or twice I came back to camp and there were multiple cats wandering around the camp. I loved it because it was like having a pet without using camp budget. Sofia doesn‚Äôt shoot most of the animals, however there are some players that will as soon as they come to the camp.
---
It is not. Without the machince, you can't print the bottlecaps themself and even if you're the most talented artist of the apocalypse, with the tools you can get, there's no way you can handpaint a convincing replica of the original caps print painted surface.
---
If you are looking for your first decent gun stick with 2 stars.
---
If you already have a decent weapon and looking for god roll then go for 3 stars.
---
 If you think you'll be using the weapon plans that you buy for bullion then buy legendary modules.
---
They're already reusing Fallout 4 as the framework for the game, you're lucky they even bother creating models for the new monsters and such.
---
Are you not satisfied with your accommodations in...our little Enclave? \*Cheshire cat grin\*
---
That‚Äôs it right there , We have developers who just want money and don‚Äôt even fix their game
---
Hopefully, any way have a nice day back to the grind for outfits.
---
Oh, i see :( thanks!
---
You are bloody brilliant thank you so much :)
---
I see, afaik no one is selling a bloodied one, just checked the market. Oh well :( thanks
---
That‚Äôs one of the only original things about this game is a couple reskins of enemys and a couple new models
---
Seems so by the comments. Thanks
---
Thanks
---
I'd put a saddle on it.
---
Change friends.
---
~~That should work, same as the Pioneer scouts dailies. I haven't done Biv dailies in a long time though, but back when I did he had a tendency to bug out and some days not give me a quest at all (even after hammering on the interact button).~~
---
Edit: Thanks for the correction /u/JaggersLips, seems Biv is on a timer too.
---
Also, the quest from the ally in your camp *is* on a timer - it feels like 24 hours but it might be 20. I keep forgetting to check.
---
no. not needed.
---
fight her in the blast zone, not out in some clear space sitting on a fence or roof.
---
Same I have almost 3k but some how I have 6 wood lol
---
Multiple times I've stayed on a world and then gone to the next server only to find the camp has packed up my entire build and stored it. I've posted in this reddit group so many times about how shit the camp building system is
---
Yeah. I'm pretty sure it's a typo on the cork. Has to be. I've had 1st for 2 months and spent half of my time picking up every single bit of junk and have just short of 2k.
---
So, in short, you didn't find a new base spot.
---
Supposedly the "rare" plans you can get from the supply caches are from the same weapon/armor loot table as the presents/pales. Which dupers had duped to hell and back or people who benefited from duped presents.
---
Yeah but I mean glitching into a place you shouldn't be able to get into isn't quite the same as using blueprinting which is legitimate to place an object they likely forgot to make non blueprintable. One is exploiting a bug and the other is more or a legitimate use of a game mechanic.That being said bethesda is bethesda and would rather ban people for their mistakes (dupers) than fix things like all the hackers.
---
You too! Thanks! What outfits you looking for?
---
only buy things for caps on the xbox LFG posts. there are way too much scammers on there.
---
Well, I don't know on what platform you are, but on PC you can forget to actually buy it - those are trade-only items, usually for other legacy or high-tier legendaries (perfectly rolled Fixers, handmades or heavies). But well worth the effort - I run with BE90 version and I haven't got so much fun with legacy for a long time. Shame, this weapon breaks like crazy...
---
I don't but that's because I didn't want my camp to become a blueprint that I'd have to place again.
---
So does this mean that I can just stay on the server for hours but next time I change server my camp will still be there? 
---
That would be super handy for when I play with friends and they can still place their camps but I can't.
---
Maybe false flag ops? lol
---
I could've sworn he was Optimus Prime!
---
This is the way
---
Do you know how frequently they recycle them?
---
On the upside I'll be less sad when I get my 59th sequined rolling pin plan
---
It's people who figured out Bethesda once again messed up and didn't make the ammo factory's machine something you can't blueprint. Not really a bug or an exploit unless exploit has been changed to be much more vague in it's use. Technically there is no difference between blueprinting this machine vs blueprinting anything else it's just likely they didn't mean for it to be bp'd.
---
Yup. Your camp will be right where it was next time you log on and nothing will have changed. You just won‚Äôt have access to any of your stuff, but if playing with friends, you can always use theirs or whitesprings to fix things
---
BiV is 20 or 24, like the Allies.
---
Heh, the number is so irrelevant for me, I just grab whats laying around and when I reach my limit I pop the tent and carry on.
---
I,m fallout 1st and I have been collecting scrap for ME, so i dont get it when people assume were just just gonna donate all our hard work of collecting stuff to just give it all away just to cover non-contributers  this ain't gonna happen.
---
This is the way.
---
I mean technically blueprinting objects IS a feature and thus this really isn't an exploit by definition. It's a bethesda screw up to not have made it a non blueprintable object.
---
BiV and Allies are 20 or 24 hour refresh.
---
bulk and sell whatever junk you dont use for crafting. you don't need more than 100 peices of most components.
---
this game is not hoarder friendly. you need to manage your stash.
---
It wont-work like that. It's no different than the scorched event when we had to kill how ever many scorched we killed.
---
  They never told us that we hit the limit or not until the event was over. 
---
There isn't going to be a physical meter you can watch, you just have to hope we put enough scrap in there.
---
 So I say let the dupers add as much scrap as they want to get rid of it in the game. Lets also hope the rewards we get for donating aren't that great.  Otherwise the dupers are just another step out of us.
---
Whether it took 4 mins to build or 4 hours does not matter. No player is any better then another player, and I fail too see why your camp should take priority over their camp. They were there first. 
---
Not everyone is into making some sprawling mansion or some tricked out design. Sometimes four walls and the workbenches are enough.
---
You can use flamethrower traps to break your own crap. No need to have to pay someone else to do it for you.
---
They wouldn't show, but every time you enter your build menu, you would still see their gold outlines.
---
What a nihilistic way to look at things. What do you gain in other similar games like battlefield that you are not gaining here?
---
dreams for 2021 and beyond lol
---
Smashing!
---
I'll just use a friends camp next time that happens then.
---
Thanks for letting me know :)
---
Reading this thread, it explains why I tried to go to my CAMP and ended up at someone else's. They were in my party, so i didn't lose caps, but I was quite confused for a few minutes.
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
Yup and I'm right out side the wayward and it's always the same ( crane sign weapon and armor bench.... that's it)
---
BOS jump suit, forest jump suit, responders fireman outfit, the usual suspects lol been grinding the events for month got a few items off me list but the grind is really killing me.
---
I'm new level 16 and need concrete how do I get it
---
Very similar to me. Just started the game and saw the atom shop and legendary run load so booted up a private server. As soon as I loaded in, i was met with that beautiful screen of "Disconnected from server". Loaded back into a private and my character loaded in fine but all but 3 1/2 were done. The one that was half done was the events with 1/2 done.
---
3.5; heehoo brother hood power armor
---
Supposedly that's coming in the next year or so...
---
Same on xbox. High tier trade only items
---
Wasn‚Äôt that technically a different type of jet?
---
they said in the post that they cant find it anymore....
---
Wasn't it supposed to be over all platforms together? I remember after they released Wastelanders they released a number less then 48hours later 2.569.999 floaters popped or something.  If its cross platform numbers i have faith.
---
Brahmin are vulnerable. My shortest-lived pet was a level 1 beaver. Lasted about a half hour. Longest lived is a mirelurk king who's been with me for a month. That bastard is fierce - he'll go sprinting out of camp after level 62 ghouls and come back a few seconds later.
---
Also how are you level 340 after playing everyday since wastelanders? Did you start from 0 then or came back to the game?
---
Because there's people under 100 who don't know better
---
lol, yes hail mothman for that
---
Most useful shotgun perk (in my experience) is Enforcer, under Agility.  
---
Being able to stagger or cripple is an absolute godsend when you're facing Assaultrons or multiple high level Yao Guai/Deathclaws/Mirelurk Kings
---
Players can‚Äôt damage them anymore, bethesda randomly deciding to kill them or respawn them when I load in however...
---
i think its to maintain "balance". if you have the ghillie suit, you cant have armor equipped or it comes off. so you have to choose between stealth or defense. letting people use the ghillie armor "paints" would negate this. that's what i assume is the logic behind it anyway.
---
Super mutants but its slow
---
I just collect 50 and do the whole job usually, as I'm quite quick at that event.
---
For STR, I felt that the perk which makes you reload faster made a great difference.
---
Don't forget Enforcer under AGI.
---
Four Leave Clover is also great since every single pellet can trigger it.
---
As for stealth: Well, your classic AGI perks...
---
I'll grab it, now. Thank you so much for the help!
---
Isn‚Äôt this event suppose to come back?
---
Idk I price everything super cheap, the only ammo I put as 2 and not 1 is 50 cal, but I‚Äôll prolly drop that to 1. I even have some ammo up for 0.
---
Point is not all know market value of selling items, including ammo. Some still sells those for suggested price (one that game gives you by default, i.e. 50 cals for 5 caps or Fusion Cores for 160). They don't bother to change it or maybe even have some experience that it was sold for that price, so they think the price is ok.
---
Watching assaultrons crawl makes me laugh every time for some reason.
---
I play alot, my immune system is comprised so I've been on lockdown with the recent events, I'm also trying to get the rare outfits. So I do every single event that pops up. I'm 601 hours in. I bought the game, when it first came out but couldn't get into it. Maybe rank 7 then when wastlanders came out, I was hooked. I ranked up about 100 levels the last double XP event. And when there is events on like mole miner and faschnact I don't really sleep so just keep grinding away levels and events.
---
On XB too. I see at least 1 a night, and more often, am on a server with 3
---
Steel - one set of x-01 power armor wipes out most people without 1st.
---
I can carry about 12 weapons total before becoming over-encumbered because I have to carry stims/radaway, because stash is full of legendary weapons I cant scrap due to scrip limits.
---
 Can't go outside and use a survival tent either. 
---
I have never run out of cork, not sure where you got that?
---
Running out of concrete is very easy if you are a camp builder.
---
How you can  &amp; play the game is not how others play the game - the fact so many people are astonished by this post makes me believe they do not explore most of the game/builds/features  OR is so far in end game that they have made everything/have all the plans etc. OR they have FO1st and they have forgotten what it is like to manage the stash.
---
Just a week ago everyone of r/fo76 was complaining how even with fo1st there is not enough stash space. What a different a week makes.
---
I feel ya! A few weeks ago I was very lucky and got the big load of rare Jumpsuits reward from Uranium Fever, chuffed!! I have the Responders Fireman one too, I think from the Halloween Event.
---
When someone in Line of the Sands with BE Plasma Gatling or hacked Minigun wipe 95% of spawn before anyone can reach it or similar case in other quests then yeah, it will affect you, unfortunately.
---
Killed several diseased eye bots yesterday... clearly they're lookin where they shouldn't be
---
Thank you for the suggestions. I did actually have that reload perk equipped, it's the one that reduces the weight of shotguns also right? I took it off because I've been so used to using strong back that I missed it too much, Nevermind that is scattershot, and I have it equipped. I'm a noob lol
---
And empath is technically okay too, since you also get the -25% team damage buff as the mutated player, so the extra damage gets canceled. But if more players on your team have empath, the reduction bonuses stack up  to 37 % iirc.
---
I sell ammo for 1 cap each. I don‚Äôt usually have much ammo I put in the vending, but I don‚Äôt see the point in 5 caps for a 44 round.
---
There are two responders one Halloween and one normal Halloween one is yellow, other is red and blue. Either one is a great outfit for anyone's collection I'm hoping they rerelease them this Halloween too.
---
not much, it was common reward during event that will be back soon. I'd say 300 caps max for someone who, for whatever reasons, didn't played last time and don't plan to plan to play incoming event either.
---
I really hate the cunts that use explosive flamers. They kill my fps
---
Ye, having no performance feedback is the biggest demotivator
---
Remove frog legs - add Marsupial as a possible mutation. Boom. Even playing field for everyone.
---
Well you are going to have to drink faster because we only have two weeks.
---
Are you in?
---
Some people just put everything in at the suggested price not knowing what to charge. Others are just dicks.  Most others, LOL.
---
On PC, and I don't have anything special to trade. Oh well I can live without it, but at least I know that its a legacy weapon.
---
Oh definitely. And I always judge it super harshly if it sucks.
---
I guess they will give 'em away anyway regardlessly. They don't need yet another pr disaster.
---
I use 50 cal but still refuse to buy it from a player if its over 1 cap. Otherwise I'll buy every bit of it lol
---
Eh. The mods there can be very picky and biddy there.
---
Virtuous karma, they can take that straight to the bank.
---
Honestly I never even see if anymore. That and .45 might as well not exist at player vendors. Honestly if I saw .45 for 2 I‚Äôd buy 6k worth if I could.
---
Those dam holes.  The only thing that bugs me in this game.  No idea why but fuck they freak me out.
---
Too late for you but generally better to wait to spend atoms on levels until final levels done they take more score points
---
As a Melee build, what are Bullets?
---
I thought it was going to be cross platform
---
oh yes, a little liberator chasing a cat around the camp! :D
---
A Colossal Problem is in patch 21 (August), while legendary perks are coming only with patch 22 (One Wasteland update), which is slated for a September release.
---
And how many are on steam, you think everyone linked it with steam  already? or many people play only from Bethesda launcher?
---
Nice! Cheers!
---
Really? I'm constantly picking up .45, I sell like atleast 200 worth of it each time i'm online
---
Sell stuff for cheap in your vendor, you'll make more than just dumping it on the ground which is the other choice.
---
Congratulations on the by bundle too, I didn't start collecting till around level 180 few months back. Up till then don't even know there were rare outfits. I know I've scrapped or sold them to the robot vendors in the past smh.
---
I‚Äôm on ps4, so maybe that‚Äôs why, but I haven‚Äôt seen a single player vendor with .45 for at least three days.
---
People using .50 cal usually use .50 cal machine gun.  That eats ammo and charging 2 caps is way too much. Just my two cents. If ppl buy then keep going with 2 caps. But it‚Äôs cheap to make and used way too often to be charging 2 caps. I sell .45, 5.55, .50 cal, and 5mm for 1 cap and consistently sell out.
---
862
---
Just like cleanup Appalachia:) im glad im not the only one who sees this coming
---
Legit I‚Äôll switch it to one cap.
---
I always go to adventure mode, because I am too scared to go in private first. I‚Äôm very superstitious about this bug, even more devastating that it hit me given all the precautions I take. I literally spend 5 Minutes of gametime at the end of a session to prevent the game from screwing me.
---
Good idea in theory, challenge is how do you implement this effectively? There would need to be a way to easily identify who is on the PVP team and who isn‚Äôt, without it taking away from the immersion of the game itself. Just randomly shooting other players and seeing if they shoot back doesn‚Äôt really work.
---
that looks so dodgy lmao
---
Man it¬¥s just fun to participate. Something to do and in most other posts i see something beautiful, people organizing and get together. So i don¬¥t really see a downside except for the rewards.
---
Same, in the early days probably scrapped loads of stuff! HaHa. Cheers bud!
---
I'll have to login to check their names, but I know of at least 3 of them that don't display outside of the preview in the atom shop!
---
You never could
---
If you want to commit to another clunky grind with bare minimum endgame content then yes. If you want a game with subtance, a tear jerking plot, characters youll fall in love with, and that runs smoothly then no you should keep looking.
---
When I remember they are there I always join. So many times 2 events and I‚Äôm like oh ffs. I swear if my balls didn‚Äôt come in a bag I‚Äôd lose them all the time I‚Äôm so forgetful
---
I dont see why having every other PVP player show up on the map is a problem. I mean the whole point is people want to fight.
---
Yeah we know about atlas being future brotherhood base for like 3-4 months.
---
I‚Äôm guessing that for this event, they will be watching very closely for something like duper‚Äôs. 
---
They just did a whole big ban wave. And a lot got unbanned. I‚Äôm hopping all those that got caught and released got their accounts tagged. 
---
Hopefully they will be watching these players and what‚Äôs going on.
---
Haven‚Äôt you just described NW?
---
Maybe if there is anything wrong with the first load in at all: crash and/or the thing where it counts down from 2 (world found) but something guves and it starts again for some reason. Anyone had an autocompllete after the world-found-countdown resets?
---
It‚Äôs 5 days
---
leveling isn‚Äôt hard, and if you don‚Äôt spend time online looking stuff up on the game you‚Äôd never know
---
Obviously there are players who‚Äôd rather PVP in the map than play NW.
---
Am I is 1 cap per. 2 for ultra.
---
I don't really agree with the last statement - you have to think before sharing cards - two days ago I've joined 3-player public team where someone shared Rad Sponge perk. Since I'm bloodied build it's harmful for me, so I asked him if he can change it or at least deactivate. He, in non-polite tone replied, that if I don't like it I can leave a team. What I did...
---
a massive cork ball pit, so they can play in their Power armor without scratching it
---
Thanks man, means  a lot. Much appreciated
---
I too use a simple 1* Bloodied Gatling Gun for normal everyday use.  I find the Raider ammo machine relatively sufficient to keep it going.
---
I've retired my Gauss Minigun because I've found a B/FFR LMG which absolutely shreds and the spin-up time of the minigun gets tiresome.  All ammo collected now gets dumped into the ammo converter for .308...can't wait for the new ammo converter improvements so I can use the LMG more regularly.
---
I usually do it every 20, as any more than that I'm over encumbered!
---
I always make sure it's the first thing I do when I sign in, either join or create a team. Otherwise I do the same thing lol
---
Fuck pvpers. 
---
Go play another game, and let F76 grow into a Pve experience, as it should be
---
I'm super forgetful too. Luckily for me, I got into the habit of joining one before I check my dailies.
---
But then your too far apart. I quite like the NW set up. Only played it because of the score thjngs. Not something I‚Äôll endlessly grind tho I don‚Äôt think but it makes a change
---
I‚Äôm not opposed to that. I just feel like it takes away from the fun of it. Imagine playing NW and all the players locations were shown on the map. Not to mention it would be a major disadvantage to stealth snipers and melee/unarmed builds if the commandos and heavy gunners knew where they were coming from. Just my two cents.
---
My commando kills faster with cheaper ammo, so am going to pause Queen runs on my heavy gunner until the legendary ammo perk comes out!
---
I've grown to like the ease of ingress/egress.  Repairing my buggy bungalow is not a priority considering the other major bugs that exist.
---
Won‚Äôt hurt the PVE aspect because you literally need to opt into the PVP.
---
I've never seen any harmful perks luckily. So far I've mainly seen increased benefits from mutations, less caps for travel (my favorite), and extra chance for additional stuff from containers.
---
I have three characters and one of them is a stealth Commando and he chews through 45 like it's nothing, so I filter all my 45 to my Commando. I'm not saying that's what everybody does but I wouldn't be surprised if it were the case
---
yeah happened once to me
---
As I said to someone else, if they make all the people on PVP teams just show up on the map it‚Äôd be easy for people to conduct team engagement. Remember, these people would be itching to fight other players, so I don‚Äôt see why they wouldn‚Äôt just go for kills!
---
Yep so I had to remake my base LOL 
---
And for some other ungodly reason they made the camp areas a circle so it‚Äôs a lot of re-shifting
---
class!
---
So what's so good or different about it?
---
could have sworn that the goals are community based, like that of the Scorched and Scorchbeasts kills community event
---
Yes but again, the PVP community is itching to fight each other. They won‚Äôt care about all that, and it‚Äôs not like stealth was ever viable in PVP as things such as the Quad Tesla Rifle exists. I can see them enjoying it.
---
Basically what happens at most events now then? I've been to several events and players with explosive weapons pretty much one-shot everything (including any spawning legendaries) before I can even see them let alone tag them. As a result I end up giving up on a lot of events.
---
I wouldn't mind if they'd at least let us tag something before they kill it all.
---
Weight reduction perks are also welcomed, generally all that are neutral to your health/radiation level etc.
---
I had wondered this too, especially as I saw someone say that achieving 150,000,000 steel in 4 days was ridiculous. 
---
I have around 50,000 steel in my stash. Using that, I worked out that there would need to be 3,000 other players with that much steel to hit the target.
---
What event are you talking about I‚Äôm not up to news with this game anymore
---
It‚Äôs not really different, or better, but I thought it would be a food place to share stuff to people and have good interactions with people on the regular
---
Aww man. I imagine the same would go for like a cat or rabbit?
---
1c for any and all normal rounds
---
indeed, with this .50-cal beat and mini nuke basses...
---
I just got it, it works. I believe it's under the Character Challenges.
---
I want a duel drum mag on me lmg.
---
Such as "Each player has a 1000/day limit on donations"...just because. 
---
Admittedly with the system also rewarding donations with a chance at plans etc. this event is going to massively favour F1st players....and also reward players not putting all their stuff in at once I would think. Might be best to drip feed it in to get more chances at rewards.
---
200-800 caps.
---
New Inside the vault talked about new Bos community events and rewards
---
If you want, you can click buy, and on the confirm screen it displays the full name. Works with player and NPC vendors
---
I want to see the responders back to stand against the BoS.
---
Agreed, and for bulk too.
---
Haven‚Äôt seen any of those used yet (not saying it‚Äôs not possible) but I presume small creatures aren‚Äôt popular due to how easy they die and how regular attacks at bases are, including the walk back to base which isn‚Äôt always successful, no idea why they decided with that design choice but hey lol
---
Fortifying Atlas which starts next Tuesday
---
I'm glad someone else agrees. It's so boring crafting ammo. I feel like it takes me away from the game and ruins the immersion.
---
There's been nothing about individual player goals and rewards, only singular community based rewards of items or extra events. 
---
So if a single duper completes it in hour 1 it will have absolutely zero effect on any player - although I suspect there would be lots of anger and Beth would be a laughing stock...again.
---
They are. But you also get individual rewards along the way. The ‚ÄúATLAS Donor's Provisions,‚Äù which you can open from your inventory to receive goodies and a chance at rare Plans.
---
Yes there has. You can get ‚ÄúATLAS Donor's Provisions,‚Äù which you can open from your inventory to receive goodies and a chance at rare Plans.
---
Go read the Inside The Vault and be better informed.
---
Yeah I've seen this monstrosity around too, it's a handmade that behaves like a legacy explosive laser.
---
What about when your team leader decides to change the team objective to PVP and that's not the team you joined?
---
Bruh
---
Is why you should always be on a team now, so kong as your in the area anything your team mates tag you can loot too.
---
Had a friend in radiation rumble the other day whose game decided to crash for most of the event and he still walked away with several legendaries.
---
That and know what events are ideal for farming legendaries and which ones to expect only yourscrip and notes. 
---
Most of the people complaining about never getting to tag anything are always running the worse events for legendaries.  
---
Is also plenty of places outside of events with upwards of 3+ legendaries per spawn.
---
When I want legendaries I have no trouble finding plenty even with others 1 shotting them.
---
If your that bad at tagging stuff find you a decent tesla rifle.
---
There are multiple autocomplete bugs going on.  One some people are not talking about is one that if you autocompleted a challenge due to a bug exactly a year ago with the same challenge for the day, then the game will remember that and autocomplete the challenge.  I have had several challenges over the past few weeks that were identical to ones for the same date a year ago that were autocompleted, yet the new ones for the same day this year are not autocompleted.
---
My first was a vampires with the damage buff - it basically means I can tank without having to use slots for tank perks. Good stuff üëç
---
For sure
---
Man im glad that with my bloodied gauss shotgun that I only need the shotgun damage perks and demolition expert and kill everything then
---
Simple, just make it so that you cannot change the objectives of PVP public teams and vice versa. It is a special case for a public team, not a hard work around.
---
So if it's basically the same as here, what's the point of joining it?
---
My alt agrees wholeheartedly and laughed jovially
---
How's Navarro?
---
Heresy! In Fallout 1 they were the saviour and preservers of mankind.
---
Have they said that it will stop as soon as the goal is reached?
---
Prop all the junkies/bloodied and unyielding gear I scrapped when TSE shotguns were the meta, before reddit told me junkie/bloodied gear were popular.
---
Edit. Scraping an explosive laser gun (can't remember if gatling or not) before they became legacy gear. I remember thinking this is stupid laser beams can't have explosives in them.
---
The thought is good and if I could trust Bethesda to implement it in a way that wouldn't be a Griefers Paradise that they only just recently finally eliminated I'd be on board
---
I think it‚Äôs a solid idea to work off of. PvPers may be a small group on this sub but there is a lot of them in the wasteland in other communities.
---
It‚Äôs an idea that doesn‚Äôt interfere with die hard PvEers and a more viable team option then say role playing for charisma lol
---
Also, Save your scrip for the 50% offfpurveyor sale coming on 10th to the 14th of September given we meet the gathering goal for atlas
---
It's great because I have 0 use for ammo.
---
I accidentally do it sometimes. Just killing too fast. If it happens I always drop the legendary I get from it though.
---
I feel like they‚Äôre already looking into something of the sort. We‚Äôll just have to see if they can properly integrate it like you mentioned.
---
Yeah I heard that's the best. I have the plan but I haven't built it yet
---
That only counts the STEAM users.  Bethesda clients are not included.  There are about 45K active PC users and about 400K console users according to most estimates that I have seen.
---
Mort is Jason mews aka Jay from Jay and silent bob.
---
I put an upgrade on mine, bumped up to 12 or 15 resistance for ballistic, energy and I think radiation? Plus a few strength points I believe
---
So you quit to desktop. Did you check in task manager to see if the game was still running in the background?
---
Have you tried writing things down? Taking a picture of the challenged with your phone? You know helping yourself not forget?
---
Launched my 1st last week. Now it is at least 2 when I play.. With a silo loadout I enjoy running loud and straight up in face Gutsy and Assaultron faces. And with at least 1 other person...more bots to pwn.
---
15 -20min max.
---
I NEED a liberator for my camp and an eyebot to follow me around the wasteland
---
Thanks for explaining:)
---
Their operating on market assumptions that don't reflect the reality. 
---
As people have to work to find the vendors in my camp I make up for it with the best prices around, don't even charge for my ammo.
---
Because ATLAS is bigger than Colossal.
---
See what i did there?
---
the beauty of a junkies build is you can pretty much do what you want with armour and perks.  
---
Just maximise that damage output and go absolutely HAM!
---
You won't get ban.  However, you will cause instability in the server for others.
---
*surprised pikachu*
---
i sell 2mm, gamma, plasma, and fusion cells at 2 caps a piece and they sell to the right buyer. Only thing over that is Cores.  
---
Some prick was selling 12k 5mm rounds at 1k caps a pop.  
---
Ive seen that ammo seems to be on the rise, but it doesnt affect what im going to set my prices at.
---
How do we know that no one else will be able to contribute once a certain amount is given?
---
I imagine the days that they have the contribution thing active, it'll stay active even if the overall goal is met. The number that's listed for the goal is just the least amount that has to be contributed for the community reward. Theres nothing stating we *can't* continue to contribute after the goal is met. Just that there is a start and end time for each different material.
---
Thing is, the fact that it chews ammo means you need more. Needing more creates more demand. More demand means the price would be higher than other bullets that are consumed less, all else being equal.
---
I'm level 170 I believe. Along the way I've found a few guns that I love now, but I'm always on the hunt for that quad for old times sakeüòÑ
---
Oh yeah I didn‚Äôt even think about the walk back to camp lol. I highly doubt they would even make it to your camp then lol. Yeah, strange design code for sure
---
I mean it obviously doesn‚Äôt apply or matter when I have enough to do it all the way to the end like I did. 
---
That advice only applies to people who skip earlier levels and then are stuck grinding the ones further on for 3 times the cost. I worked out I had enough to finish so no need or point to wait üòÅ
---
I‚Äôd already ground to the point I could finish, so technically I did exactly that.
---
Ideally when the servers getting reafy to reset you will get a message at the top saying Game services are shutting down soon.
---
Oh ok, the reason I was looking for good perks is because with the junkies Build itself I don't have that good of a weapon so I only do about like 200 damage (without factoring in the enemys damage resistance)
---
The only thing Maxson and his "Brotherhood" deserve is to stand trial for treason. Much less the hard earned scrap gathered by our... valued... members.
---
Yes, it wasn‚Äôt. I even manually exited Steam so it wouldn‚Äôt run in the backround anymore, before shutting down the PC.
---
I have no idea to be honest. I was fairly new when I got it. Had ranked up playing fasnacht and got it during one of those events. At the time I did not know to pay attention to the other perks. I know it wasnt explosive ammo (which makes me feel better lol), but otherwise I couldn't tell ya. It was so steady though, a really great gun
---
sad, comment is sad   
---
Murder wave in your city,cant beat them join em   
---
Mafia controlling your county, cant beat em join em   
---
ISIS take over your city, cant beat em join em
---
You need to leave the server and rejoin to clear that up immediately.......it‚Äôs a major pain when it happens though. 
---
If the hunters do find the raider first it's my experience that they just stand about waiting for you to arrive anyway, either that or they keep a slow jog going. You can just kill the hunters then anyway.
---
I have no problem hunting down legendary items, I did a run last week with a player and we picked up 2 sheepsquatch, 2 SB, a SM and something else...might have been a gutsy...all in the bog. 
---
And playing in a team to tag things requires you to actually be teamed with the specific players doing all the vaping, that's not happening much.
---
My complaint is more that these players are instantly killing off things the moment they spawn...it tends to make events much less interesting when it's a matter of whomever happens to be fastest to pull a trigger claims all the kills.
---
Solution, don't do the events and find something else to do instead...it's just that it's a shame that the events then become the realm of the vape players. It would be nice if they could hold their trigger for a second to let others try and tag things or even just not vape everything in sight...use something that takes maybe two hits or doesn't clear an entire room at once that's all.
---
If the raider is dead when you find them, hang around the body for a while, it might take a couple minutes but the quests should update and then you go back to Rocksy
---
I dont buy ammo if its more than 1 cap. Lvl 142 bloodied, lvl 363 big guns.
---
Of course that's true. That's because they can't use exploits and duped OP meta gear in  Nuclear winter, which means  in Nuclear winter they are evenly matched.  And that is the whole problem with PVP outside of Nuclear winter.
---
PVP without exploits outside of Nuclear winter is like professional body building without steroids.  It simply doesn't exist.
---
Fun!
---
Ah never knew that one thanks !
---
The one driving me absolutely crazy is the disappearing workshops. I have to log off and on 3 or 4 times to get them to show up. And it's getting worse.
---
Thank you for this. And thanks to everyone for the other replies.
---
My camp is in a very rarely traversed spot so it's almost never taken. 
---
The few times it was tho I was to paranoid to stay in that world. Last thing I need is a weeks worth of work lost in some weird misshap server hopping.
---
Yep. Did it quick.
---
Yeah i know about if they kill him i have to go back But you get extra rep if you kill him yourself  so it kinda screws over the mission
---
Do you say that if i will go and complete all three daily at once, it will count as completed Mistaken Identity for atom challenge, even i completed it before? Or the only way is to create new character and complete it with him?
---
Oooo same haha someone gave me marsupial when I was lvl 60 or so and I didnt use it for weeks cuz I thought it would expire or id accidentally use rad away and get rid of it lollll
---
Same reason that there are high level players building camps all around the vault entrance with pretty basic plans and outfits at ridiculous prices...they hope to find a player who doesn't know any better to buy it.
---
What are you using? Look for some 2 handed melee builds. 
---
You could use a bloodied melee build and just remove nerd rage (although you could leave a point in just in case your health drops) and serendipity.
---
It a seller market
---
I use them all together.
---
I guess I could use a bloodied melee at like half Health
---
Agreed. Exploited items and such are an issue regardless of PVE or PVP. I do think having legendary effects in PVP spices things up, which is what I assume a lot of the non-NW PVP community enjoys.
---
I feel you! i also think all floating camps (foundation with only stair holding up a a mc mansion) should be destroyed on sight no patter if the owner is there or not or in pvp. #bringthefloatersdown
---
Tri barrels are better but imo penta barrels look better
---
All the ghouls should wear traffic cones.
---
How about testing a feature before it is implemented?
---
Traveling pharmacy to make your drugs weigh less. Chem fiend keeps you high longer. If you're a melee build, Good With Salt to make your meat buffs stay fresh. Man that's all I use except the grocer backpack allows you to carry tons of meats and booze.
---
Edit: Party boy to enhance the effects of booze.
---
You can sort the persk according to SPECIAL in that order.  
---
There's an option at the bottom. The Bow skills are in the PER tree. Always look at the bottom of the screen when you have a menu open. You can also sort your Pipboy tabs by weight and other options if you didn't know.
---
Make a new alt, if you can, and have someone help you clear out camden park before you start.
---
I‚Äôm excited as the eye part is in black
---
Oh ok, how much damage do you do?
---
Partyboy/girl rank 3 and drink whiskey for 6S points.
---
But I desperately want itüò≠
---
I always have a ton of booze on me üòÇ
---
I try to defend and not bother with the ore. When barelt enemies can get there because everyone wants to kill I'll just go by in the chinese stealth suit and get ore instead
---
I switched to unarmed.  Just couldn‚Äôt get decent damage output with 2 handed.  I roll bloodied unyielding with DCG or MMG .  It‚Äôs amazing
---
If they don't someone else will, or if their bloodied their at greater risk of being killed by mobs stacking up and landing lucky hits.
---
The only event I go to with any expectation of legendary drops is SBQ and Radiation Rumble. 
---
I even carry 7 power armor frames at all time just in case it pops up to block off the 2 hallways.
---
Usually walk away with some 4+ legendaries even for a failed event.
---
I got a refund within a day, for it.
---
What is unnarmed?
---
I dont take workshops but when required for the daily-weekly, so that's a new one to me. I'm more annoyed about the fast travel being busted to high hell, VATS not working 80% of the time, having to reload with a half or more full magazine, rez locked during events and having to fast travel away to just spawn......the list goes on and on.
---
Just like real life items are worth what someone is willing to pay for them
---
üòñ
---
I‚Äôm not doing it, boring grinds make me lose interest
---
It was more massively produced thanks to Myron in Reno. They had it pre-war though. Check out 09/29, where they shipped Jet into Vault 95 before it closed, which means it was available pre-war. It was just more readily available after Myron simplified the manufacturing process

---
This happens if you played a round of NW before entering adventure mode. Has something to do with scaling maps between the modes.
---
No I‚Äôm just guessing.
---
From what I've read, you donate in increments of 250.
---
You only need one set of X-01. It‚Äôs a one time cost.  So that‚Äôs an invalid point. 
---
You don‚Äôt have to lug around the weapons for long. Scrap the weapons for the resources at a nearby station. There is one literally at the exit of Uranium Fever.  And you can price your scrip legendaries low to make room (10c per scrip value; they will sell fast). You can get a Chemist‚Äôs Backpack mod or run Traveling Pharmacy to free up weight. 
---
And who cares if you can‚Äôt use a survival tent?  That‚Äôs not an issue in this part of the discussion. 
---
Cork and Concrete are the only two resources in the ATLAS list that aren‚Äôt super common. Those are the only two anyone should have even *slight* concern.  And once you‚Äôve built something, leave it built. If you‚Äôre building for fun and creativity, that‚Äôs a ***choice***. Guess you‚Äôll have to choose what to do during that *three day period*.  Maybe don‚Äôt build new stuff for 72 hours, if you want to contribute to the ATLAS project?
---
Stash management is part of the game, and not overly difficult. The problem is when people get hoarder and FOMO mindsets, or they just ‚Äòwant it all‚Äô. 
---
You can play however you want. I‚Äôm not dictating a style of play to you. What I‚Äôm pointing out is that there are solutions to your stated problem.  The reason you don‚Äôt like it is because to get something you *want*, you‚Äôd have to give up something you *have*. 
---
Your enemy isn‚Äôt the stash box limit or FO1st. 
---
Your enemy is your **completionist, gotta-have-it-all, fear-of-missing-out, hoarder mentality.**
---
You have to decide what you want. Because you can‚Äôt have it all. At least not for free.
---
She's gonna get a nocturnal rolling pin from me
---
I thought we already could, either by dropping one near then or putting it on their inventory?  I might be wrong.
---
No.  It won't.
---
I think that the only way you'd make this work is to have 'arenas' on the map where your teams could all enter, like an instanced area where you'd go with your team captains. Turn the Watoga Civic Center into an arena, turn some part of Valley Galleria into an arena, maybe even make some new areas, too.
---
Give me Muggy from Old World Blues, damn it.
---
Just isolate PVPers on their own servers already. Give them survival, ffa, ctf modes and delete all forms of pvp interation on pve adventure mode servers. Let them ~~rot there~~ *live there* so they never bother the rest of us again.
---
Yeah I guess there's no sense in expecting courtesy anymore. All the uranium fever events where players would emote everyone over to the legendary so everyone could have a tag on it, now it's "If I don't kill it immediately someone else might so I should be first"...or blocking off parts of events to force things into specific areas for them to farm like line in the sand.
---
Like I said, it's a shame that the game has become about people farming legendary items rather than playing the game. Courtesy is no longer a part of the game
---
LoL, quite possible.  Been my point of view a long time.  So, where do you prefer to fight from these days?   A reason for it, or not really?
---
Omg I‚Äôm so glad someone finally said this!! It makes me feel so uncomfortable üòñ
---
Silly question here, but you are toggling the mission to active in your pip boy after initiating it, right? I always have to turn mine on to see the markers.
---
You get 25 extra rep on top of the standard 200. It doesn‚Äôt ‚Äòruin‚Äô it at all. 
---
Nine ‚ÄòI found him dead‚Äô runs equals eight ‚ÄòI killed him runs‚Äô.
---
clever
---
So no issue then?
---
How does this ruin your enjoyment?
---
I can‚Äòt handle Floaters, but anything else for sure.
---
I was thinking that if this challenge doesn't get the participation levels Bethesda hopes for, they're going to reward us nonetheless. I mean, if they have a failure like that and the community doesn't achieve the numbers they launch at us, the response by haters and reviewers will be outrageous and drive more bad press to the game, and now it is one of the best moments for the game in terms of fame, there are not many active haters and it would do a lot of damage to the game: from "it's a game that was crap when launched but they've improved and it's getting better" to "not even the community is supporting the new Bethesda challenges". Unless they give us new rare plans, I don't see many people releasing their materials and scrap just for the sake of passing the challenge, it's not like "kill X scorched", which is more of an direct and active proposal, somehow tied to the in game history (people were coming back, we had to clean Appalachia, sort of), and unless you are a BoS fanboy (or a collector, I guess), one does have to feel very motivated to prepare their arrival...  
---
So, they must not fail, for the game sake, and if we'll fail, I think they'll make us win it anyway. They have more to lose, than we do.
---
POSSIBLE STEALTHED UNIT IN THE AO
---
\*starts feebly crawling in your direction\*
---
Yeah i always do that
---
at the very least a 3D model (which may be what you were talking about at the end) instead of 3 pictures
---
Currently it doesn't change their combat effectiveness, it's only cosmetic.
---
Yeah the same thing happened to me last night.  Im very disappointed
---
the things that carry you through most events :)
---
With a Bessie skin pls
---
Do these work in solo public groups?
---
They're always the same players who complain that vendors are worthless because no one buys anything.
---
I hope you got the players name and sent that along with these pics to Bethesda
---
Plus to honest I always assumed all drugs in fallout had normal pharmaceutical names before the nukes fell, than after it was simply changed due lack of old world knowledge.
---
Well, with the carnivore mutation (forgot to mention that) when I eat cooked Yao guai, sheepsquatch, glowing meat steak, mutant hound steak, deathclaw steak, bourbon and psychotats, optionally mags and bobbles, I can get 1400+ dmg with my mole miner gauntlet. If you're crazy, add nukashine to double that. I don't do nukashine but you see how it all stacks. I'm probably forgetting some buffs too.
---
Dont forget your mutations. At a minimum, i would go for speed demon and marsupial. SDs reload speeds is especially useful for shotties - even combats.
---
People like me will pay 1500, which I just did the other day to have a second set üòÇüòÇ
---
Ah. Well, I‚Äôd love to be able to beef them up as well, although I wonder about balance since they can‚Äôt be killed. Not sure if they even can be downed; I haven‚Äôt seen that yet myself.
---
Easy there, she doesn't need to solo the scorchbeast queen, just help defend your base
---
That's pretty good! The only problem is that they eventually wear off and food spoils so quick
---
It's not the Brotherhood specifically who are giving us anything. It is a guy who heard they were coming and is a huge fan of theirs but not affiliated from what I understand.
---
So more like some wastelander nut has collected a bunch of rare stuff and is now using it as bribes to fix up the place the Brotherhood are going so they will like him when they get there.
---
There‚Äôs a quest where you go to the bottling company and create inoculated soda... you‚Äôre telling me there are no cap machines there that can do that?
---
I would much rather have a slider for quantity.  
---
If I were to accidentally click on "craft all" it would be bad news with 60k steel and 55k lead in the scrap box.
---
You wouldn‚Äôt be bothered bc if you don‚Äôt opt into a team you won‚Äôt get blasted.
---
Gauntlets, powerfist, boxing glove, etc.
---
Exactly. I have no idea why OP thinks we‚Äôre going to clear out public servers when private worlds are available to us. And I don‚Äôt think they know how item respawning works.
---
I could see how that would be a problem. Maybe there could be a second 'are you sure' button?
---
Oh. I use power armour most of the time.
---
Sorry to hear about the immuno system issues but congrats on the dedication to the grind.
---
Haven‚Äôt played for ages . Got tired of game breaking glitches and lvl 800+ players coming up to my work shop and one shotting me for it ( all ya gotta do is ask and I‚Äôll give it to ya jeeeez)
---
My brothers, stop worrying about the cork, steel, glass, whatever.   We could sit around and do nothing at all for the entire event and it would still slowly progress and be completed right at the end.  Bethesda pulls the strings here, and you can bet there is no real tracking of what is collected.  It is all an illusion.  The servers already struggle even without the extra "Logging" of whatever is being deposited.  That meter is gonna fill at whatever rate Bethesda designed, and nothing we do is going to change it.
---
Yeah! How dare other people play this game the way they want!
---
lighten up, Francis
---
I see nothing but courtesy from the bulk of this games player base. 
---
Really it's much more discourteous demanding people play the game the way you demand then trying to guilt them for supposedly being terrible people when they don't.
---
Especially when so few players actually visit these forums. 
---
You cant change how other people play the game, but you can adapt your own gameplay to maximize efficiency.  
---
With one of the best strategies being running with a full team and making sure your attending the same events.
---
When I've come across this and I've messaged the owner asking if they'd take 1c each if I bought all they had, they have all said yes and came and changed it for me. Granted, I've only done this 3 or 4 times but still. Maybe they're just taking a shot to see if anyone *would* pay that much but not really expecting it?
---
Wow, thanks.   I had no idea it was a once-only event.
---
Yes! Should have said in my post but this is what I thought as well
---
Honestly don't know. I've never tried before.
---
I've already started my hording.
---
Meat buffs for 30 mins, most of them, but some are 60 mins if you have the recipes. Since equipping Good with Salt rank 3 I literally have never had a piece of meat spoil, and I carry tons. Drugs wear off much faster, sadly.
---
Oh I didn't know meat lasted 30min. For me it's only 10min I'll have to get that perk
---
There's no special reward for doing so or even story content to see. Idk why I thought I'd get a cut scene lol. You can just go to scorched earth as soon as you leave the vault.
---
I think the next season we will see removed or decreased instances of NW SCORE objectives. So many players have voiced their displeasure with it being railroaded into the daily requirements despite still being in beta.
---
For shotties you want to aim for +2 at a minumum. Getting something with +33%vats hit or +15% bash damage (which are 2nd-3rd star only mods) means its a magic shotgun. Magic shotties will dominate regardless of its prefix.
---
For example, on my stealth shotgunny i can literally oneshot a L91 glowing deathclaw with a **L15** \+33% vats hit pump action with a garbage prefix (assassins or something).
---
that is so funny!
---
I was just getting ready to but they logged off, I know it started with an 'In' or and 'Iv'.
---
Yep. I looked at the dates of the event and ‚Äú...oh‚Äù
---
What games do you recommend? I'm looking for something else to get into to keep from burning out in FO76
---
Rats
---
In addition to all those new zones OP speaks of, I think It will be interesting to have an underground map like The Burrows or, better, one of the vaults, maybe even the lobby for NW, to have a skirmish-type of battle.  
---
I know the ring of fire would be absurd in this context, but it should be easy enough to make some kind of radiation block some zones so the map shrinks anyway: maybe something like "automatic doors closing due to radiation, this is not a drill" and if you get caught inside, you're eliminated.    
---
  
---
This would also make nuclear bombs useless, but it should be parched just by making that zones/areas maybe closing manually as well. Or just ditch the nuclear bombs for the interior maps.    
---
I know this is to far in terms of involvement for them, because, lets be honest, they have just given us 2 maps with no variations day/night/storms since they launched NW and something like my proposal  involves more programming than the small number of devs left can manage, I guess, but nonetheless I would like to have an interior map with no many orange crates around,
---
as a .50 cal user thank you
---
Plot twist, bulking only affects the weight of aluminum and lead. I learned this a couple of weeks ago. I still think that bulking is an effective way of organizing things, and aggregating what's on your character with what exists in your stash, but it's a punch in the stomach when you find out that it's only effective for 2 items with the weight saving. 
---
[Check it for yourself with Steel.](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Steel_scrap) .05 steel scrap x 30 pc bulked = 1.5 bulk wt.
---
Because they are pissing away the shitload of money that FO1 and the atom store bring in on other games instead of using it to hire more people to fix this one.  It's a slap in the face really to the loyal Fallout fanbase who pay good money in hopes of getting this game fixed and expanded.  I guarantee you that most of our money is going to other projects.
---
We have been asking for that button on player trading since day one still haven't got it. Great idea just they never listen.
---
Despite its shortcomings, its still a fallout game. I have put about 250 more hours into 76 than i have fo4. And its been 100% solo play. Zero trading, zero handouts.
---
Sorry, I'm on PC.
---
I have seen so many of these on PS4...  I only reported the first one I found because it was blatantly obvious, very similar to this one.   A lot of them people have tried to hide. Had one where they had it all in an interior of a metal wall structure but you could hear the extractor sound from every angle so I know the inside was filled with them. 
---
I legit think if I reported every one of these I came across they would ban me for sending too many reports. It's ridiculous.
---
I got mine used for ten bucks at GameStop and it was totally worth that and more. I understand it was a total shit show at release, but the game now is full and quite enjoyable.
---
There's no reason to believe the rewards for contributions will stop once the community goal is reached. It's just a target number, the individual "events" still have start and end dates.
---
Outstanding move !
---
True
---
Assaultron Dominator. Best robot in the game.
---
It‚Äôs got all you need. Invisibility, Ridiculous DPS, HEAD LASER, Tons of bulk. 
---
That or a Colonel Gutsy. Those AP rounds don‚Äôt mess around
---
I try to take them if only for the fast travel points. But with this glitch they're just regular locations and you have to pay full price, even if you control them.
---
But what‚Äôs the issue? You can still donate and get your goodies
---
She's in the Transit center
---
Those quantities seem like minimums, not caps. Even if someone were to somehow fulfill the daily requirement in one shot, there has been no indication that people will not be able to continue to contribute during the allotted time.
---
With the BOS coming back soon it my go up in value since I'm guessing a lot of people may want one.  I snagged a BOS jumpsuit from a player vendor a month ago for a great price and I am going to hold it for awhile.
---
Currently it's likely worth about 1k or less I would say.
---
I got a bloodied shotty you can have.  On PS4
---
This is so cool!
---
Isn‚Äôt there a brightness setting? Does it change anything at all?
---
It's not there because of super duper perk. That's the explanation I've heard, be it valid or not.
---
Stop spamming the board with this every day.
---
Im on PS4 too and im constantly selling hundreds of .45, i pick them up and my ammo machine is making them. I know they do sell relatively fast.
---
I think there is a community goal in the millions and personal tier's set for personal rewards.   I guess if dupers meet the community goal on our behalf,  oh well.
---
Not surprised at the level of problems that keep accumulating with the amount if neglect this game gets. And the fact they let Cheaters run Nuke Winter, I've turned in video after video and get told to block them is my solution. Blocking a person does NOTHING for nuke winter, they still show up in matches and win by either being under the map or 30 feet up in trees......
---
We do have a wearable nightlight.
---
Entitled much?
---
I'm curious if there's going to actually be a stash box there on the site, or are we going to have to lug ourselves up there over-encumbered.
---
Person Number 5: Fuck those Brotherhood assholes, I just want their clothes and protectron. Gimme gimme gimme.
---
Then theres Me, the Enclave member who would gladly nuke every last one of you just because Modus asked me nicely.
---
Maybe they could just give us toggle buttons to make at least 10x of the normal amount. Maybe give us a perk card we could put on to let us craft 100x of the normal amount. That way super duper could still be activated.
---
So what would be the downside of wearing one? As because how you suggest this, it would be the most OP thing in this game.
---
Chem Fiend and your respective damage perks. Traveling Pharmacy if you want to hoard your chems.
---
I agree. I created a post last week I think talking about faction themed teams.
---
My idea was to make a "blood eagle" team that places everyone joining that particular group in non pacifist pvp mode from the get-go.
---
Basically you could join a "blood eagle clan" and you are flagged for pvp.  Obviously this would show on the map and make finding mutual battles easier for the pvp crowd.
---
These are just the ones with specific melee buffs. I don't know of a perk that makes food buffs last longer. That's just melee though, all junkies weapons get the junkie buff. So it's hard to go wrong.
---
Why is it when someone suggests something - suddenly it's an attack?
---
Gameplay has changed. Yes there are a lot of very friendly and helpful players. But there are some who are mercenary farmers who don't give a damn about others and want to do nothing but farm as fast as they can. They have a tendency to ruin events for other players.
---
I'm not making demands people play the game the way I demand, and no one is trying to guilt or suggesting they are terrible people (you did a fine job of blowing things out of proportion here).
---
I'm suggesting that it wouldn't hurt the vape players to allow others to get a shot in before they kill everything in sight in a single shot...especially if they're going to use exploits to change the battlefield as in line in the sand, or in uranium fever (which is usually lower level anyway). 
---
I played the event...urgh, can't remember the name...it's at the sons of dane compound with the instruments etc. 
---
There was myself and 3 other players. The 2 other players who started the event were in power armour with explosive and tesla weapons that were one shotting everything that came in...fair enough I'll take my shots where I can and I was hitting a few. Not one of them would step out to play an instrument and it was obvious we weren't going to get to the end even though I kept playing. I would play then have to stop when something ran up and hit me...I would stand up take out the weapon and they would shoot it...so I would sit down and start playing again. 
---
When the third player arrived he put suits of power armour down blocking all the entrances then ran around outside killing everything.
---
There wasn't even a chance to finish the event because not one of them would help...and even if they did the last player had made sure he was in a position to kill everything before anyone else had a chance. Now - from what you've indicated so far that's our fault for not adapting to his gameplay...and how dare I suggest that he change how he plays the game...but on the flipside HE is ruining my play of the game...shouldn't there also be some consideration for them forcing me to play the game the way the way they want?
---
I'm hoping that there's a balance where we can all play the way we want without forcing our choices on others.
---
I think for some of the more insane prices, like 1k/round for 12k 5mm, it is people thinking they are setting a price for the whole stack of ammo, rather than per round. Either that or they were advertising how much ammo they had in the hopes someone may offer a trade.
---
I consider 50 cal one of the cheapest ammo to make so would never buy for one cap when you consider shotgun ammo is also one cap and is more "expensive" to make (needs plastic which runs out easily if you're a shotgun build).
---
Well if your getting dustied the probability of you staying at full health the whole time you're engaging would be very hard unless you doing a sneak build
---
Those are good ideas for sure. There is an ammo crafting perk coming with legendary perks I believe. I really don't think they have the ability(for whatever reason) to adjust major gameplay functions. They can only add(dangerously) new ones.
---
Do your part boys, and rob the Whitesprings
---
Maybe it‚Äôs something they will
---
Implement in the coming months. Lots of content coming up
---
FYI, its not magic, even with the right mods, unless you can get its effective rate of fire over 200. I dont know whether or not the explosive mods counts as doubling rof or not as im not a heavy user.
---
Oh snap, I didn't realize I could have underarmor with more carry weight! Which one do you use, or can they all be modified for extra carry weight? Now I gotta remember to check that when I get home üòÜ
---
There would have to be something that gives a risk of using it, like unyielding has the low health. Like perhaps 100% increased damage taken.
---
When i am on Caps max and need ammo i dont look at prices and buy .38 for 8 Caps per
---
Bulk and sell to vendors is the best option if you need Stash Space asap.
---
For me it isn't about the legendaries at an event like Line in the Sand or Radiation Rumble. It's about the XP because of the repeatable SCORE weekly.
---
If someone kills everything instantly I get no XP. They literally get it all and nobody else gets anything. With the way they glitch Line in the Sand now with tents, you are lucky to hit even 1 scorched before they're all melted buy a magic or glitched weapon. That's not ok or cool.
---
I agree! I understand people not liking PVP on this sub (altho imo it got whiny), but i think done right it would add great value to the game.
---
Yeah that's a good idea, double the damage that's incoming
---
Until I hear what 'rare' plans we can get, I will be keeping my scrap.
---
Yeah it took me around 3 possums to get one back to my camp but I moved camp when I found one spontaneously just to keep it lol otherwise I don‚Äôt think it would of survived
---
You're amazing, thank you!

---
I've been getting much better legendaries and have everything I want. Don't know if the drop rates for popular gear has been changed and people are getting what they want from the game world more, this would account for a drop in sales. Or if I've just been lucky.
---
...now I want a gun that shoots sheepsquatch staves...
---
Can we get this as an ammunition type for a harpoon gun???? Or a broadsider???? 
---
Or a dog companion that shoots bees when it barks...either way.
---
No, it won‚Äôt. I‚Äôve had all three dailies show up at the same time. As stated, Mistaken Identity occurs once per character.
---
Safe to say it's gone forever then
---
The Brotherhood's secret mission: start an Appalachian winery to help fund their projects. I'd bet that wine would glow if it had Ultracite as an ingredient
---
&gt; I do think having legendary effects in PVP spices things up, 
---
It doesn't   "spice things up."  It stacks the deck against anyone who plays the game honestly.   Every single "serious PVPer" that I know has duped gear.  I don't care if they themselves dupe it or not.  They are all running a setup that is simply not possible with a normal play through completely free of duping and exploits.  This applies to every single serious PVPer that I know. 
---
Not a single serious PVPer that I know got his gear through grinding. He got it through trade, which basically means it came from a duper.
---
Same here I was looking last night cause someone want 6k of steel for a outfit I wanted. I only have 1k and I‚Äôm a hoarder as well always running excavator power armor for the weight bonus
---
No, they are not. The super sledge has a rocket engine on it.
---
Then there are the musical instrument weapons.
---
are there?
---
There is no downside to dying anyway
---
It's still alarming how long they take to fix not being able to preview an item in vendor view
---
I can't remember if it was the Survivalist or Revolutionary bundle (I have both), but I know for sure one of them has been permenantely removed from the cycle. Sorry.
---
Caps is not the only way to bottle something. Plus not any bottlecaps passes as currency only Nuka-Cola caps. Nobody said it's impossible to make, it's just impossible to counterfeit. And the chances someone can get its hands on a working nuka-cola bottling machine and also have the neccessary infrastructure and resources to run it is extremely slim.
---
ED-E doesn‚Äôt exist yet. How can you have an ED-E skin before ED-E is even assembled?
---
There better be some damn good plans if I'm sinking my day one stash box. I mean far better than they put  in the trash pails for the mole miners event!
---
bulk AND SELL. AND. SELL. YOU DONT NEED IT.
---
That would be crazy overpowered to have SPECIALs all boosted when you're full health.
---
The downside would have to be basically the opposite effect, -2 to all SPECIAL (and climbing) if you're not full health. If you're at 99%, -2 to all SPECIAL; below 80% -3; below 60% -4; etc.
---
If you don't have a pretty severe downside, running the Healing Factor Mutation, and maybe a Vampire's weapon, along with the highest DR armor you can get you would be an overpowered tank.
---
Only the best for my queen
---
I know a guy who played for the first time during the last double XP weekend. Public teams+2xp+lunch boxes+line in the sand server hopping got him to lvl 150 in a week. He had no clue about the market and his prices were super high since he never bothered to visit an other players camp. He got bored after 2 weeks and moved to other games but if he ever logs in back you would think the same, why a lvl 150 has those prices? 
---
Because levels mean nothing anymore. Back in the day you would be scared to those players and ever respect their time and dedication to the game but I think the bar should be higher now.
---
For a while there it seemed like if I put 50 up at one I‚Äôd just sell it immediately and I kinda felt like I wanted to give people a chance to get it ya know ? The money barely matters to me I always have close to money cap
---
Not true, you'll get the event reward just by hiding in the bunker having not fired a shot.  To loot the queen it's minimum 1k damage.
---
There's also one (legal) you can get from having an Ally level with the Raiders at Crater. Costs bullion, though.
---
On my charisma character, I always share a 3-star Inspirational.
---
On my chaotic-scavenger-mutant-character (non-bloodied), I share Last Laugh. Boom!
---
That's a good idea as well, maybe decline specials as health recedes
---
The events people keep bringing up most with these issues are usually the worse ones for both XP and Legendaries, they take too long and dont offer enough rewards to justify the time sync for running the event from beginning to end beyond the initial experience of the story eventa.
---
You would get far more of both doing a quick west tech run while waiting for one of the better events to pop. 
---
If none are popping up I usually server hop to find a more active server. 
---
Several events I never even bother with unless theres already people running them and only in expectation of notes and scrip then I go back to farming xp and legendaries elsewhere where mobs are plentiful and players arent.
---
Well it is still an annoyance. You have to run back to where you were, hope your loot (if there are other people around) is still there, and in case of bloodied build manage your radiation again to nerd rage levels.
---
A month passed since Legendary Run started. That's a month of autocompleted challenges for many. In that month, there's been 0 fixes and very little communication. Not only that, but the solutions provided have been a complete joke.
---
Add 2 extra challenges to make up for it? Ok, those will get autocompleted too. So much for making up? I mean, it's great for those who never had it happen. But that's just an extra spicy spit in the face of those who have it happen constantly.
---
And this newest one? You demand our materials for another double score event so those who dealt with your broken game for a month have a chance to finish? The ingnorance and disconnect with the player base is just astounding. It's the developers fault so why is it that we have to spend MORE OF OUR TIME to have a chance at finishing the season?
---
I've been a FO 1st subscriber for months. This is the last month that I'm keeping my subscription. Not because the game is broken, but because of complete lack of respect and understanding of the players.
---
There was an issue where there were no shots of a female character wearing the King Grognak outfit in the Grognak bundle. Your idea would absolutelu have cleared up all of that confusion
---
If you read any of the notes or terminal entries, you know that the Brotherhood failed because they are a bunch of A-holes who can't get along with anyone else.  They spend 90% of their effort fighting the people they claim to be trying to protect.
---
I say we should get a second donation option.  Give us a 'keep the BoS out of Appalachia' donation box.  Let us see which box gets more donations.
---
Accidentally scrapping the &gt;!fashionable raider outfit you get from siding with Crater!&lt; followed by accidentally scrapping my Responders paramedic jumpsuit.
---
At least I've been able to replace my Arktos Lab Coat after accidentally scrapping that one too...
---
For general purpose and all rounder and especially for lower to mid levels, I would suggest finding one with the primary Legendary effect of Executioner's, Anti Armor, or Furious, all of which provide flat out more damage without any gimmick like Bloodied or Junkies.
---
Interesting.  Was it like this? 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i12w7j/got_the_autocomplete_bug_a_documentation
---
There game mechanics and there is lore. Player characters can die and respawn infinite times, fast travel, and craft a huge mini gun in seconds because these game mechanics are fun for the player.  But they don‚Äôt really fit into the story of Fallout. Basically a lot of hints you can do as a player are not story canon.
---
This has not been thought through, not even an iota.
---
If you know how to make a boodied build, you aren't going to be dying enough to wear that would ever be too annoying
---
Wait what‚Äôs fortifying atlas? This isn‚Äôt something we‚Äôre gonna have to do next season is it? If I have to collect 200,000,000 cork next season I quit.
---
Nope.
---
The rad damage is getting to him. Mental faculties degrading. Soon to be a feral. Best put it down now and ease its passing.
---
I got my atoms back put a ticket in.
---
My Foundation mission popped up every time I loaded into a new world this morning (Adventure mode, like 5 times in a row), so...I mean, if ward needs that doodad so badly, imma give it to him
---
try this setting:  [https://imgur.com/gallery/aJgvEqn](https://imgur.com/gallery/aJgvEqn)
---
That could work.
---
There already is a stash box outside IRC. I went up there yesterday (not realising it was shut).
---
True, but there's some things you CAN'T BULK that you can sell, fiberglass spools for instance have a tendency to pile up in your stash and a new player probably wouldn't catch them just from bulking and selling with the mindset that builking things actually was mitigating their weight issues.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs what auto completed mine the other day, loading into adventure game crashed and when I booted up the game and loaded back into adventure I had 7/9 complete.
---
Annoying thing was avoiding being on either sides of reset and not playing NW until after I had finished all challenges and I had gone 4 weeks without it happening... the one thing I can‚Äôt control, the game crashing -_-
---
Bethesda's solution: everyone, drain your resources and grind blindly. We'll maybe give you another Double SCORE event if you donate enough. Don't worry, challenges will be autocompleting during that event as normal.
---
Yeah I was thinking that would be the only way really.. to move your camp close to it.
---
Did you do the NW challenge before the last reset? I have never done a NW challenge and never encountered this
---
They actually intended to have fixed this....but apparently there's still some things going on with it.
---
Happened to me early 2019. My team mate launched a nuke. I was also saving the last mission and it was completed without me lifting a finger.
---
Honestly just put the automatron robot bench in the game
---
:D !
---
While I agree that the game is better as a PvE game (because their implementation of PvP has always sucked), the game was originally advertised as supporting PvP.
---
Announcement of new thingies to do by Bethesda last night :) We have to help the BoS rebuild the Atlas Observatory
---
I have a level 100+ alt that never bothered doing it.   Thanks to you guys, that challenge was just checked off the list.   Thanks so much!   
---
Now if I can just get the "visit locales" one checked off.
---
I disliked that part of TESO when it was introduced
---
I get that message all the time because my survival tent is by sbq.  Popular spot for them
---
Yeah, that worked.   :)
---
I wasn't grossed out before I read this. Thanks a lot üò§
---
Thank you so much.  :)
---
The thresholds would have to be very high though to balance it... above 99% health as the other guy said, even then it'd probably be better.
---
Krampus!
---
It's nice to hear that they are adding new perks. Hopefully they will add even more legendary perks before they come out in September.
---
Yeah, its on one of the metal hangar sheds.
---
Ya think
---
Mad Dog Malone is a hot mess who is his own exception to everything else. He aggros on you but is not visible on the map as a red pip (but has the quest marker on him). His health bar shows as red if you look at him unlike the Bots on Parade enemies.
---
Ok, but not everyone wants to farm XP by grinding 1,000,000 West Tek runs. We should be able to grind XP how we see fit. Doing events with my friends is way more fun than solo-running West Tek for the 10,000th time.
---
There is an assload of XP up for grabs at a lot of events. RR, PP, and LITS especially. Nothing can justify people stealing XP with glitches/bugs from other at these events. It's bullshit and needs to stop.
---
I see/know a lot of people use the Resource nodes, when the glitch with the vendors was out how long was the player vending/trading down, and people were pissed about that, then the Display glitch, certain things, that players use, go down for a while due to figuring out how and then fixing that glitch. Is the game perfect? No, but there are a lot of legit players, that are the ones that get screwed over because a someone that has to do X amount of steps to do something that isn't allowed in the game.
---
When I did my alts a few builds I did some core ones like shotgunner, sniper, commando etc. Then made specialisation for bloodied/junkies etc. Because these specialisations are slightly effects my core builds.
---
Like bloodied addition is nerd rage or junkies is chem-resistant (chem-fiend and party/boy girl are a good addition too just take more points)
---
That's the problem, they think those cheats make them equal or 'better' than normal players....reality is it just makes them an even bigger looser
---
Yessir.
---
Alright Manson
---
Id be uninstalling it shortly after logging in.
---
What platform? If PC, give me about six hours and I'll probably have more than I want. Lamorak\_2000
---
I'd take it
---
its so easy to make any kind of ammo by yourself its strange that anyone actualy buys it for any amount of money.
---
Option 4.) I'll donate if the rewards are good
---
Thanks (:
---
Nope. I only ever do CAMP placement, and I believe the day before was Overseer Rank
---
I don‚Äôt, because if I stay in a server where my camp couldn‚Äôt be placed then next time I enter a server all the shite off my displays will be gone and I have to set everything back in the racks and shelves.
---
(Imagine going into a public server for the first time in months after hearing about people stealing stuff out of your stash through a bug, then coming home to your house to find your TSE Handmade, Tenderizer, Meteor Sword, Fancy Revolver, all four rare Fasnacht masks, and everything else in turn displays are just gone. I literally shat bricks thinking someone robbed me of everything I owned and held dear.)
---
Theres also me I'm a member of oh look shiny neeeeed
---
So as long as I donate 1 unit of each, am I eligible for the rewards? I don't care too much for most of rewards as I look forward to killing as many fascist BOS cunts with their military industrial complex as I can. I'm just trying to finish the legendary run without spending money asap then coming back in winter when more content is added.
---
Ammo getting worthless \^\^
---
Probably
---
Set yourself a little challenge, like only using pistols or something
---
Rolling pins only. No melee perks.
---
Fix the game 1st
---
Well your game crashed so that's similar?
---
I have lots of industrial water purifiers so I don't bother locking them as I'm happy to let people pick up some water when they come by. Recently however I've discovered a few players that have started farming my camp whenever we're on the same server, every 10-20 minutes or so they go to my camp and clean it out of anything that isn't locked. 
---
While I'm happy to let others have some resources it's getting a bit much to farm my camp so I'm considering locking half the purifiers just to make sure that I can at least get SOME of what I'm making.
---
I hate those fucks I have to drop crap so much I usually give ammo away or sell every thing for ten caps or less. It‚Äôs so easy to make money I don‚Äôt get why people charge so much
---
How could I be so blind
---
yeah this freaks my husband out SOOO badly!! It gives me the creeps too, but not nearly as badly as it does him.
---
Yup. Definitely sucks. At least I'm ahead of the "suggested" Rank for completion. Plus my next reward was 150 Atoms (which I never use), so as soon as I completed the Dailies I DID have and Ranked up, I cashed in my Atoms Reward then spent them for another Rank up.
---
Levels don‚Äôt really mean anything anymore. I‚Äôve been playing since launch and mainly run around on my level 140, as that‚Äôs my vendor account. 
---
But to answer your question, might just be a way to draw people to your CAMP. I place items in every vending slot as to not have anything grayed out, and ammo that I don‚Äôt use I just load into the vending machine. 
---
Most players will visit a CAMP that has tons of ammo, plans and aid items.
---
Isn't that a workshop? Do you get perks for discovering workshops?
---
So, team Hunter/Hunted radio?   
---
Probably should be included TBH. PvP isn't for me, but if folks want to do that I don't see a down side.  
---
Side note: I'm still annoyed that there was a "Survival" game type with literally zero "survival" gameplay elements. Just call it deathmatch, ya dicks. It's just rubbing salt in the wound for those of us that wanted Fo4 style survival gameplay instead of the half-assed "survival light".
---
If you are stealth one you probably want a pump action or a combat shotgun. Specialising yourself for bloodied/junkies will also increase dmg. If you do not wanna commit too much you can use instigating, anti-armour or your liking. (I do not prefer two shot due to the range and VATS)
---
My first perk will would be skeet shooter (perception) for range and spread its a must for shotguns. And grab ones from strength. Also you can get an off weapon build for unarmed because its cheap and good damage if used from stealth. Also do not forget max agi and pick up stealth bonus perks if you running it in stealth and VATS.
---
Xbox unfortunately
---
What did you swap Psycho with? Thanks!
---
Honestly Nuclear Winter is abandoned at this point for single player content. They don't seem to understand that because of cheating hardly anyone plays.
---
But same boat as you. I jumped off Nuclear Winter sometime ago.
---
is that an obscure movie reference or a bad analogy? can't tell tbh lol
---
You need to read Rule 5 of this subreddit. 
---
If you‚Äôre not going to respect the rules of other subreddits, why should anyone have faith you‚Äôll follow the rules of your own subreddit?
---
üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª i do the same always when i see in camp‚Äôs vendor things which are interested for me.
---
Worked for me when they fixed a load of the discover locales challenges. I think I probably used an alt for it. The one that didn't work for me was Beckly (neither the town nor the Mine Exhibit), although I must try that one again.
---
i cant see shit at night.. I wish I could turn the brightness up
---
I'd keep it as a fun weapon. An exploding black powder rifle is always enjoyable.
---
Never said you had to farm any one place a thousand times. I never do and have never had an issue with gaining my daily level up.
---
Some events are way more beneficial than others in terms of the full package of returns.
---
I'll usually just temper my expectations based on the number of people around. 
---
I've yet to even experience anyone using tents in line in the sand, and if it's clear the scenario isn't ideal then I'll  just go find another event or go to one of the many good farming spots near by for a quick rum while occasionally checking for the next event I do feel like participating in.
---
If the world has an excess of over geared players can just server hop too.
---
You'd have alot less headaches tho diversifying your routines if you've mainly been strictly farming events then always frustrated at people with better gear and builds doing their thing.
---
If memory serves 1 cap represent 1 bottle of clean water. Like a bank notes use to represent gold. It's been a while so not sure if this is canon or a fan theory.
---
Create a new character and run straight for the bog. If you can get a 4 man team together willing to start new characters do it as a squad, the chaos and fear will push you to try new strategies and weapons that you‚Äôd never think of. It‚Äôs the first thing I did on launch and I enjoyed the hell out of it!
---
thought you were referencing thee pope or something, so i referenced Charles Manson as trying to find something polar opposite. Just boread at work tbh :¬¥)
---
I remember buying ammo because I thought it was buying all the ammo for the price. Long time ago but yeah maybe that‚Äôs the same mistake people are making.
---
I've only ever had my current camp blocked once, and I definately checked out my neighbor's place just to see who else wanted to live beside a fissure
---
This album is great for camp items: https://m.imgur.com/a/3ZhkLJl
---
Good lord that‚Äôs a lot of materials... I‚Äôm lucky to save up 5k of each.
---
This is why the dupers were unbanned. We need their help, there's no way legit players are going to do this the right way.
---
Mmmmmmmmm I want one (currently have a executioners explosive combat shotgun and it my favourite)
---
Oh yes, that¬¥s great, will give me some feel of reward other then just checking the bot for the codes. Much appreciated

Lots of ways to play and there is a lot more to do now with Wastelanders. I have more than 2,600 hours in the game and lvl 292 now (I don't grind levels, usually just what's needed for daily/weekly challenges) ... And still log in to meet friends I've made wandering Appalachia every day.
---
Yeah, wish i had known,
---
Remember when npcs could steal your gun? I would be leery.
---
Has anyone from Bethesda ever said that, or just random people guessing? Because, even though I'm a bit rusty, sadly, I still have enough basic knowledge of computer programming to be baffled by that argument. There's zero reason for Super Duper not to be able to work while crafting a stack of things - even if they wanted to be super lazy about it, a quick *for* loop could calculate how many times Super Duper should have triggered, then they could just multiply that number by the amount to add per proc, and add that total amount on at that end.
---
Really, the only potential issue I could see is just that the engine as a whole doesn't currently support crafting stacks of items. *But*, if they were able to add support for that, I'd think/hope integrating proper support for Super Duper along with it should be trivial, really...
---
Why did they not use these factions in the game? Just finding corpses and recordings sucked...
---
this goes over many people's heads
---
Well that¬¥s dissaponting, i guess this game was horrible at launch on top of an empty story huh

I have a photogallery screenshot of two L80 leggo scorchbeasts fighting a mirelurk queen.
---
One of my daily go-go spots is the X13 quarry lake, that always has a queen in it. There is a nearby fissure as well. My farm loop takes me past the fissure as im leaving bog town to hit up the quarry and for some reason two SBs spawned. I drug them over to the lake and pulled the queen over to them. She held aggro while i nuked them one at a time.

My onestar nocturnal board was less of a reward than the SS itself.

There is some truth to that "levels mean nothing anymore" especially when people are moving weapons in between alts/mules but it really doesn't come to be a problem unless they are over level 50.  At level 365 I had a level 22 come up to me yesterday as I was doing my daily with Ward and he keep hitting me with his death claw, I pulled out my 3\* Assassins death claw and put a stop to it.  Be careful who you test.
---
The most junk I‚Äôve seen on a player is over 5 million. The event calls for anywhere between 125-200 million. Even Scott Steiner can do that math.
---
Both times, I had sent in everything they wanted and was left on hold for at least a week until they replied. And both times, I had already given them enough info in the original ticket to not require that response anyway

Any melee weapon, sword, bat rocket etc, will make the swishing through air sound on swing, but

I¬¥d also like a capture the flag or team death match type.
---
While that may be logical to normal people, these kind of players run on different level of comprehension and thought. Each second they invest in doing objectives is a second "lost" because to them because they can't get more xp (even though the event awards that and more rewards too...but too much logic). It's the same people that make any more complex event like Encryptid fail because their lack of comprehension doesn't allow them to think further than "shoot at X" and throw "???" emotes when they can't 1HK their target.
---
I do and I take anything that I can that's not bolted down. If you didn't lock it, its free to me. Raiding is a game mechanic.
---
Yeah I feel ya. This is now the third time it has happened to me. Got the bug first two days of the run. My weeklies and dailies we auto completed. Didn't have the problem for a while so just farmed the repeatable during the XP event(without a Intel cap since I'm not a bloody build). Even managed to get myself back to 71 until yesterday when it hit again. Hopefully we are done seeing the glitch. Good luck with the rest of your run.
---
I tried it recently and neither Beckly nor bog town worked, although the character was an old one, maybe that had something to do with it.
---
Battlefront 2 was fun for a quick minute, too.  Then I saw a video of someone demoing the cheats and I couldn't even bring myself to play it again.
---
Fuck yez
---
How is it not? Technically vending is a feature, it just so happens that you could use it to dupe items. Does that make it not an exploit? You are abusing a bug in the system to create an outcome we know isn't intended, that's the definition of an exploit
---
Is ammo worth something right now?
---
I have never purchased ammo from vendors nor sold ammo because even when I priced all the ammo I had for sale at 1 cap, it never moved. 
---
I've seen others say they trade in 5.56 but I've never understood why when its extremely easy to craft tons of ammo for free. But thats just me I suppose, im very self sufficient and don't like to rely on trading.
---
you have character, world, and combat challenges.
---
Thats fair, its a very highly in demand ammo type
---
Woah there, no need to bring economics into this bro!! The market is far too silly for that
---
Yup this is true.
---
Even better the Colossis scream
---
This gets me every time. I have 25 thousand rounds of .50 for sale for 1 cap a piece. Yet when I try to find fuel for sale, I‚Äôm lucky if it‚Äôs less than 3 caps a piece.
---
It's usually a fucking fo1st camp
---
Yes it will sell
---
Yeah, originally there were a bunch of them and I think maybe only one or two of the region discover locales was completable. Beckley is the only one of those I have left now.
---
I already shitposted in a cheater discord that it will be like the ammo machine and that they will need a macro/autoclicker to donate all their duped junk
---
I discovered with an alt and it registered for me
---
Its probably worth about 10k caps.  According to nukacrypt.
---
I heard it works (or doesn't work to be precise...) differently, but I have the same unfinished one that you - Beckley in Ash Heap. I've tried to get there on foot with my two alts - no luck. Similarly with killing SBQ for Big enemies challenge - no matter if I killing her solo on private world or as part of the group, it's just plain broken. Clearly none of those are high on BGS fix priority list.
---
Definitely would be fun too, or even a domination like COD
---
Lol why?
---
I do, because my "forever camp" is right beside the spawn point of Helvetia. As soon as you fast travel for Fasnacht, the first thing you see is my camp at the side of the road by the river with all workbenches, vendors, stashboxes etc... .
---
The reason I check when I can't place my camp, is to see who else is still hanging out in Helvetia, who else can't let go... and who else still yurns for beer, donuts and small animal intestine. 
---

I want a drunkbot to follow me around so I can be constantly amused.
---
We dont need the personal stuff. Your point can easily be made without trying to fish for sympathy.
---
I‚Äôve got those two to register, I‚Äôm in the same boat with the OP, Abandoned Bogtown won‚Äôt register for me either.
---
Someone is salty lol.
---
I can‚Äôt keep ammo in stock at 1 cap each.  I normally try to keep 1-2k .50 and 5mm in stock and 250-500 .45 and 5.56 as that‚Äôs what sells quick.  About 2x a week someone will come in and buy out all my energy ammo at 1 cap.  
---
No luck selling arrows or bolts no matter the price.
---
Ammo has made my cap issues disappear and has increased my gameplay a lot.  
---
Only downside to ammo selling is the need for acid. No matter how many super mutants I take out now a day‚Äôs it‚Äôs not enough gun powder to keep up with demand.
---
Now that I am over lvl 100 and have decent weapons/armor I am getting more into nuke zones so I plan to branch out to ultracite ammo which I have started to build up stock.  Pretty sure once I start selling it, 2caps each will go quick.
---
In my opinion is to get you to their vendor. It may be ammo they don‚Äôt want to sell but when their camp gets scrolled over and it says 9796 ammo, it will get me to go take a gander at least. I mean I don‚Äôt agree with it but just my opinion. I won‚Äôt pay more than 1 cap per ammo. Unless ultra.
---
Caps aren't particularly valuable if everyone is trading
---
as am I, as am I
---
enjoy

---
At a certain level of rarity/demand, caps don‚Äôt work anymore. Many players have everything they need that can be bought with caps, and are only interested in other rare items.
---
Pretty much why I said it won't be much of an event anyway. There won't be any real contribution from legitimate players comparatively, and it's going to be an autorun regardless of what we do. The outcome is known, the intent is known, the process is known, but we're still going through the smokes and mirrors pretending anybody will really benefit from this
---
Caps just don't hold any value. Why would someone want caps when they have several toons full of it? Older the game gets, less value it has.
---
It was fixed once but I guess it broke again. I believe it only works if the owner of the vendor is in close proximity.
---
Might be your brightness settings. I don‚Äôt have any problems seeing at night. If it‚Äôs not the settings could be your tv/monitor. My husbands tv is much darker on fallout nights than mine.
---
some of them are salty PvP-griefers after the PvP changes that want to let their anger out at the community (again)
---
What's the bare minimum I have to donate to get the rewards? I'm starting to get burnt out and when I finish the Legendary run, I'm not returning until the major content is released in winter, I've got a big backlog of games to play that I've been ignoring for 4 months. A I care about are the double score rewards though to get the run done quicker. Can you get the rewards for doing nothing?
---
It's very disappointing to me i can barely hold 6000 caps at a time
---
Recently tried to FT to Foundation, ended up at the bunker north of Valley Galleria. Weird bugs
---
My husband has First so I started dumping the relevant materials off with him!  We were joking yesterday that once this event actually starts, West Virginia is going to be the cleanest state in the country!  lol
---
i make caps very easy from other means so i'd rather have flux or junk or plans or outfits.
---
Every now and then i spend a silly amount of caps and need a quick injection of caps though.
---
Me! Like who DARE takes my spot!? üòÇ
---
The player vending and display cases were down for 14 days. Player trading was never taken down. This is an old issue and doesn't answer my question. 
---
I see the point you're trying to make, but the ammo generator camp glitch isn't used with a display case or player vending machine afaik. I doubt that Bethesda would have to take down either of those features to fix this particular exploit. 
---
But again, my question is how does this particular exploit that other people use to gain more ammo for themselves ruin your enjoyment of the game? Why does other players having a surplus of ammo ruin your enjoyment? I don't personally use the exploit, but I have nearly 100k 5mm, 40k, Ultracite 2mm, and 60k .50 cal. I didn't cheat to get that, just farmed materials over and over, plus I use the ammo constructer that you buy with gold bullion. Does my ammo surplus ruin your enjoyment?
---
Caps are absolutely worthless most of the time nowadays, but especially after dupe waves. Most legitimate players avoid buying from clear cheaters, but they can still max out their caps pretty quickly from casual players stopping by who don't know or don't care. Still, explosive weapons by themselves are not that valuable, unless you mean energy weapons and/or bloodied explosive. It shouldn't be that hard to get them with caps
---
People have been using ammo as caps.  This just made ammo for trading as useless as caps.
---
I met him 3 days ago. I reported him, he did the same. It is sad that he is not yet banned...
---
When did they attempt to fix it? The last thing I saw was that they opened the vendors again after the dupe exploit but the problem persisted since then.
---
Bring back the robot workbench so I can have a sentry bot with a Mr. Handy thruster and an assultron head.
---
You will die a lot lol
---
Server hop player vendors and buy things you think others will be looking for to build up an inventory. Takes time but is totally worth it ;)
---
Taking advantage of low levels
---
You can get the recepies for about 17k caps.  Each on will take one color flux, some ultracite, and a couple other mats
---
  You can sell just stable flux for 100 caps, but when sold separately, the other mats to make the various serums will not bring much more.
---
  You can easily sell the serums for 300 caps in your vendor, although I'm sure a number of players buy them at that price then goto a local bot vendor and resell - instand profit/ROI for them.
---
and/or
---
make some to sell in your vendor cheap, then make a few more, go to a bot vendor, equip hard bargain3, pop a grape mentats, and drink CHR boosting alcohol and the bot vendor will pay you about 500 caps per.
---
Long term, yea, the recipie is worth it.
---
I don't think it will matter because nothing is saying that you'll be unable to contribute once the goal is met.
---
If it's anything like Project Clean Appalachia last year, these larger goals are going to be like someone at Bethesda going in, looking at the number, and enabling something in the Atomic Shop.  I don't think that was automated at all, as we had to wait a whole weekend to find out sometimes.
---
Just trade for one. They are literally everywhere. It could take months from purveyor.
---
Very time and cap consuming tho
---
I haven't played much during the double exp, but I often hear it gets much worse then. I think I've only run into one blatant cheater over the course of a few dozen matches in the past month. I don't think it's bad enough to quit over, but if you continue to experience what you do, then I guess so
---
I run an ammo vendor, I think the trick is to be stocked with 10‚Äôs of 1000‚Äôs of ammo before opening for trade. People buy my ammo all the time, it‚Äôs the most successful vendor plan I‚Äôve run. I have my vendor up for 1 session, then turn it off for a week so I can spend my caps. 
---
1c per round, 2c for ultracite, 10c for plasma and fusion cores.
---
I would love if they showed models of both body types in the examples.  I just went to Google to find a video of the Grognak costume on a female body.  HOWEVER, I did LOVE that the winter dress on sale right now was modeled by a male character.
---
Honestly, it's probably what most MMOs do and they count how many characters have been created and use that as the number they tell the public as how many there are. It's a common tactic to boost popularity. 
---
"Oh look, millions and millions and millions play WoW!" No, millions of characters have been created but I bet you there aren't 500 million people actively playing.
---
I'm finding the same thing. Almost anything worth having won't be sold for caps. You get to a level in the game where caps have no value because they are so easy to come by and oftentimes, you're just trying to get rid of them to make room for more. At least that's my experience. Now I'm working on building up a collection of bloodied weapons just to have some trading power since it seems like everyone in this game plays bloodied except for me lol
---
\^\^for real dude. The only ammo i stock is 556 and 50 and that junk sells SUPER quick. I was really lazy and couldn't really be assed to finish getting all the serum recipes but since i started stocking ammo, im quickly getting me the last few i need. After serums tho....i guess i'll be the guy buying everyones ammo? Or maybe get lucky and find a nice weap for sale i guess, caps will be pretty useless outside the weekly bullion purch
---
Haha yea, heard about that, seems like a new kind of challenge tho
---
Yeah I'm sitting on 70k steel and can contribute quite a bit.  Cork on the other hand...
---
Very nice man
---
Dabney Homestead, George Junkyard  Poseidon energy plant all have concrete extractors
---
Dont forget to collect garden Gnomes which yield 3 concrete
---
oh don't worry, they certainly didn't do it for the workshop, they only wanted to show you their new hacked nuke gattling in god mode.
---
I think they fixed it way before that time the vendor's got shut down.
---
I'm afraid you can't until they'll remove it as key quest item...
---
Lol he fucking deserves what he gotüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Yeah lol it‚Äôs pretty difficult. But hey, max risk for max reward doesn‚Äôt sound bad at all :)
---
Don't do the storyline missions.
---
Yah i try and combine it with my normal routine, but its not uncommon to grab something for 500caps that sells for 10k+ to refill caps. Like you said noone wants caps so when you list something for caps it sells fast if its good. Double edge sword there, trades anrough hood üç∫
---
Try 4 days. 4-8th of august
---
Nah. Bloodied would still be the superior min-maxing choice. Between serendipity, nerd rage, adrenal reaction, etc, there still wouldnt be any competition for a sneak tank dps literallyeverythingbuild. But full health builds might at least have a chance instead of being left so far in the dust
---
Satisfying
---
Which is why need the very simple yet still not implemented ability of bulking ammo so we can sell it for a decent price. There would be no need for their user-hostile ammo converter and it would give the ingame economy a boost.
---
*sick to heck*
---
Please watch your language. I understand you're frustrated, but there's no need for profanities.
---
No it's not it will be automatic
---
You don't always die a lot once you get a used to it.  Nerd Rage, Blocker, Serendipity are essential perks IMO.
---
What if duper‚Äôs didn‚Äôt contribute at all? Do you think the community could hit those numbers?
---
You're absolutely right but just like any game, hardcore fanboys never want to admit they're stuck playing a Skinner Box for mediocre rewards and will do the craziest mental gymnastics to justify how reskins are totally fair rewards for their time spent playing. Each week it's the same junk in the atomic shop. That's what happens when you hire mobile game devs.
---
The insult bot flyer gives a clearer message.
---
There isn't on PS4, at least, which actually bugs me a bit - I especially try to avoid the Mire at night because if I'm under the trees, which is *most* of that region, then I can't see shit, even *with* the Pip-Boy light on!
---
Last 1-2 weeks of  rumbles i had everyone did their role. As bloodied PA heavy gunner i tend to take one of the directions and it is no problem to hold it tight solo. At least 2-3 Guys in stealth suits or PA always mine the ore. IF no one is getting the ore  then i'll do it at least for 1/4 of all amount. But last week or two there is always people who collect. Guess its just luck with proper people on the servers.
---
Me too.
---
Pretty rude to just jump me like that, especially when you have 180 levels on me
---
A lot of high level players don‚Äôt know the basics of PvP. And PA players usually go down super quick in PvP unless they are running bloodied with emergency protocols. I like to run up a bounty, put on all my assassins gear and then get people to come attempt to kill me. Only for me to kill them and take all their junk.
---
Saw a camp yesterday selling ultracite scrap for 35 a piece. I just laughed and left.
---
Classic!!!  Nice job sir
---
I am keeping the crappy ammo for when they fix the Ammo Converter.
---
Cant atand the way it works now, but they said they will fix it.
---
Interesting. I find my biggest sales come from the serums and trash legendaries I offer. Occasionally Flux as well, but i usually have to disable my vending after my flux is sold, until I find something to blow the caps on.
---
Are heavy weapons still "magic" bugged? Because they have max reward and no risk.  It's all I see people using these days, heavy weapons.
---
I have a Junkies Explosive weapon. Double broken. Kill anything in seconds. Full HP Build with maxed PA, never die.
---
Hopefully they fix that bug and the fabled balance patch is soon. It feels like everyone is either Heavy PA or Bloody Commando. 2 builds lol.
---
go perk-less.  
---
go naked.
---
Liberator pet would be perfect for my commie camp
---
Nuclear Winter is in desperate need of a new map to shake things up.  I am beyond bored of the two maps we have after 150+ levels.  I do not really play NW anymore other than to complete the challenges and I really like the mode but it is just stale right now.
---
What platform?   If you‚Äôre PS4, I‚Äôll help ya get it done.
---
&gt; but just so damn blatant and overall it really screws the game over for others that enjoy playing.
---
You're sadly going to have to learn to live with it. We've been waiting almost two years for any real punishment from bethesda, and just a week ago they show blatant support for cheating. Nothing will happen to any of those people with ammo machines
---
Start collecting legendary modules right away. Don't waste scrip looking for weapons and armor from Mumbles, even during sales. Just accumulate a lot of modules, like 50+ . After you complete WL you should be able to roll a decent set of Unyielding Secret Service armor in only a few sessions. In the meantime you should be able to buy 1* Bloodied gear from people's machines for cheap. In my humble and unpopular opinion the fixer is overrated... But don't not get one if you have the opportunity, just don't go insane trying to get one.... Pretty well any Bloodied automatic rifle will do right by you.
---
You dont scale after lvl 50.
---
Unfortunately pc, i have a friend or two who play, so i can probably pester them into helping.
---
Its been just over a year (June 2019), buy ya I agree.  
---
I just feels like they dropped NW on everyone and then forget about it.  The amount of posts you see regarding PC cheaters (I play on Xbox) and the no response from Bethesda blows my mind. I wonder why they wasted the time and resources making it if they don't support it?
---
I have enjoyed my games of NW when I was grinding for the rewards, but man, they need to have some new game modes and maps like you said.
---
The absolute worst is dying and then sitting in the lobby or load screens.  I suck at pvp so I die often.  I just don't play it much because I get tired of waiting, and waiting, and waiting.
---
Isn't there some type of pvp mode that lets you re-spawn in the match? I guess that's my biggest complaint about NW.  I also think Bethesda needs to award more xp for player kills. This would make people hide less and speed up games.  Basically reward people for engaging eachother.  Idk
---
We just need another map really, especially since they want us to play NW daily now for SCORE
---
Hey, where would Buffout fit in this? Thanks!
---
What explosive weapons you looking for? I don't mind taking caps, there are few good regular players still trading for it because we don't have 5 characters hoarding unendingly üòÅüëçüôà
---
OP just wants to share; go back to North Dakota.
---
bush wookie is titled when morgantown isnt based on 90% of landscape= bushes
---
Theres also a couple of bags of concrete on a shelf in Blackwater Mine
---
This is delightful, I love it
---
I'm not talking about the daily level up. I'm talking about the repeatable SCORE weekly challenge. You can do that over and over for 100 SCORE per 10,000 XP.
---
If you have yet to experience the tents at LITS then you just don't do that event enough. It's almost every time unless the server isn't populated with more than a few players.
---
I do diversify what I'm doing in game, I do everything. Events, grind West Tek, challenges, daily quests, etc. That doesn't matter at all with what I'm talking about. There is no justification or cooled response that will convince me it's ok for one players to ruin events for everyone else because they have a magic, glitched, or legacy weapon that makes it pointless for others to even try participating. 
---
I can appreciate your way of handling the situation. Just leaving and lowering your expectations, putting your head down and ignoring what is going on and being passive about it is one route, and I commend you for being able to just look the other way when asshole players ruin events for everyone.
---
However I'm not the same as you and many players feel the same way as I do about this. I shouldn't have to server hop to have a chance at completing these events, rolling the dice from server to server and hoping there isn't anyone that is going to glitch and ruin the events again. Stop trying to tell me how you work around these problems by sticking your fingers in your ears, covering your eyes, and pretending the issue doesn't negatively impact a lot of people who would prefer to play the game differently than you.
---
I was walking around with 1,240 at one point with full Lvl45 Excavator.  Took a while to get around the map.
---
Person 4 (me): Fuck the Brotherhood; enclave all the way. I‚Äôll help them though because it‚Äôs new content
---
Hide in a Bush. If you can make it to the second circle that should about put you to r1
---
*the atomic shop has entered the chat*
---
Would suggest from now on you save your atoms till the last week as the later levels require more SCORE, there for you get more for your atoms, plus if you make 100 by than you can save your atoms or spend them on something else.
---
Not 6900 which was the price I saw at one Russian camp today.
---
I don‚Äôt even know how to get cork and I‚Äôm over level 300 as well lmao. I‚Äôll just periodically sell it to get some caps since I never use it and it does accumulate
---
I think the worry is that legitimate players won't get much of value. If dupers get thousands of the new plans and the average real player gets 25, that will be a pretty significant difference. It's a very realistic probability that whatever is in the pool becomes the new mounted heads, i.e worthless and dropped at train stations by the dozens. It's also kind of just the thought that counts, bethesda is announcing an event that favors cheaters barely a week after they unban them all
---
Thanks, That looks great
---
I have a piece of armor that camouflages me when I'm still, will that still work in NW?
---
No. Nw is completely separate from adventure
---
&gt;	hardly anyone plays.
---
And yet whenever I click on it I automatically find a lobby full of 51 other people.
---
You'll most likely unlock this after your first match (maybe 2, idk how much XP it takes - my point is that it won't take long). Survive as long as possible, you get plenty of XP for lasting longer and you don't need to kill anyone.
---
4.5) Ill let People donate so i can have the rewards cause they are cool..
---
thats the most accurate IRL RP i think
---
You too! I am at 67 and with maybe double score or extra dailies or what have you, it will get done. Even if I have to buy a couple of lvls in the end so be it.
---
I think the Morgantown map got released in September, so maybe 3 months after NW launched?
---
Yeah, it's almost certain we will succeed, even if not really. I mean that a \*lot\* of cork. I think I've got just under a thousand across all my characters after over a year of playing; and I don't expect it's all that hot for duping either. Still, behind the scenes it would be interesting to be a fly on the wall.
---
Make sure to invest in any perk card that offers a % of dmg reduction and don‚Äôt worry about your actual damage resistance number. Perks like ironclad or barbarian will eventually just be holding you back, while serendipity, dodgy, blocker, ricochet can be lifesavers. If you‚Äôre a commando you can be a bit squishier than a melee player. The auto-revive armor can also be really nice. UNY is great, but at a certain point special stats stop giving you as big a boost and end perks don‚Äôt do enough to raise your health. A couple auto-revive armors are cheaper than uny to buy off players and can keep you in the fight indefinitely. You probably already know to invest in crit and ap booster perks from YouTube vids. 
---
This one is more a preference, but do some real work looking into mutations for your build if you haven‚Äôt already. Class freak and strange in numbers just about guarantees you are only getting the upside of mutations. Mutations like egghead may be good to look into. A lot of players don‚Äôt like it, but strange in number will give you +8 int which is great for a bloody build who excels in a high body count. Once legendary perk cards are out, you‚Äôll want a high lvl.
---
It will take a long time changing your play style, so don‚Äôt get discouraged if the first 20lvls ends with a lot of deaths!
---
Are you calling me a bush wookie? I'm rank 93 and play actively, you can even see my previous comments on the topic.

I'm person 1, but it is a video game and I want the limited items.

Every match you play in NW mode will give you overseer xp at the end. If you played well you will earn adventure xp and cap as well.
---
This xp is earned by spending more time in the NW game session (most of the xp is this), killing other players and team rank.
---
There are rewards tied to Overseer level and events. Like now due to a bug you can earn Helloween, Santa and the last event rewards by gaining xp.
---
The bushwookie tactic is a sophisticated version of the afkswimmers. You basically run safe and wait.
---
Oh, so I can't even take my main level 49 into NW, reach rank 1 and get the jumpsuit and bring it back into adventure mode?
---
Even people outside of ND can see that stimpack spamming is not the way to go.
---
So the people who got banned and got their accounts back got to keep all their duped items some may already have this amount of scrap stored so they don‚Äôt actually have to cheat (again) to actually donate that amount, I‚Äôm assuming that‚Äôs what the OP is worried about. Doesn‚Äôt bother me, free shit.
---
yeah i agree - however if i see somebody selling plasma cartridges for 5 caps or less ill snatch them up because crafting them is a bitch
---
If I remember rightly, it's a bug that happens if your character was originally created in the beta and ones freshly minted when things went live aren't affected. I've not tested it out myself though so I could be remembering it wrongly.
---
You can. Kinda of. You bring your char in. But only the special stats go with you. Gear and such is found each game. And the jump suit, if unlocked at level 1.is then craft able on any char in that account
---
I want to have fisto from new Vegas lol
---
I have it highlighted to collect it because I noticed my supply is so low. It‚Äôs still low. Cork is rare.
---
Sunshine meadows also has concrete, and there are bags of it on the New River Bridge and Monorail Elevator
---
Its ruining the ammo economy.  
---
that alone impacts everyone playing the game in some way.
---
This is also a great way for Bethesda to remove duped resources.
---
Chameleon Wendigo travels incognito...
---
Would i play for 1300 hours if it wasn't fun?
---
As a player who never managed to finish FO4, can someone spoils me and explain how can maxon be alive now and 200 years later  
---
Did I miss something ?
---
Yeah, I'm starting to remember all the speculation about rigged numbers during the scorched event. I think at one point we were a day away from some goal with like half the goal met? And then jumped all the way up. Many people said it was rigged, but I wondered why they would have made it so obvious if it was - why not update the number to at least 2/3 for the last day? A last day push is a very real possibility from the players who grind all day after all. That won't be as possible with event gathering, since the majority of junk would come from scavenging and those would have reset timers
---
New map is definitely needed, I'd love to see a Charlestown or Harpers Ferry map.
---
I have  the disk in my hand
---
If you want to launch one. Yeah.
---
The brightness on the Xbox makes day almost too bright while still keeping night impossibly dark.
---
But it makes sense, it‚Äôs not like there is a lot of light pollution in the post apocalypse
---
That is a fair point. Have the "rare" plans been revealed? Do we know what exactly they are, because if its just recycled plans that have been in circulation from launch, then they're already low value to worthless for veterans. New players would definitely benefit more in that scenario and would probably welcome the chance to find a plethora of unlearned plans in a suitcase. 
---
I imagine since the event is BoS themed, the "rare" plans involve the rare PA parts and mods. But we'll see.
---
Damn. I swear I used to sell plasma cartridges all the time but nobody ever bought them so I dont even pick them up when I find them
---
I figure we'll succeed in the event regardless of what the players contribute since Bethesda cant afford any bad publicity right now. We could probably contribute nothing and Bethesda will just slowly fill the bar till its full. If not you cant pretty much expect every gaming outlet headline to be something along the lines of "NOT ENOUGH PLAYERS IN FALLOUT 76 TO FINNISH 3 STRETCH GOALS. NO PLAYER POP. FALLOUT IS OFFICIALLY DEAD. TODD HOWARD GAVE US CANCER."
---
Only way you‚Äôll know is if you download it and try it! I think it‚Äôs a fun game. It got dog piled HARD. Maybe it sucked at release but I enjoy playing it.
---
Can you go to an armor station and craft marine tactical helmets?
---
Yeah either would work.  Watoga could be cool too I think
---
Ah ok. So you enter with none or just basic gear? I'll survive long enough by laying low, reach rank 1 and ill be able to craft it in adventure mode? Thanks for explaining it btw, much appreciated.!
---
Please read our wiki page on this subject
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning)
---
Yeah it suckrd in release but wastelanders just came out and all of the other buggy updates. I am gonna give it a go!!
---
1 rad and you're instantly down to -2 specials, that would make it absolutely useless.
---
yes i do.  honestly i wanna fight the sbq solo.  i just wanted to make sure I can and I am not missing anything.
---
No?
---
Yup, sounds similar to my experience. It has to be something going wrong while loading in.
---
i personally enjoy it, would you? maybe. maybe not. only you can decide on it, and if you still dislike it there is always the uninstall button.
---
that doesnt mean you aint one of them, flatwoods map is literally 1big ass bush
---
Am i sad that the baaad news billy outfit will lose most of its value due to this?
---
kinda.
---
is it a lazy reskin?
---
yes.
---
do i like this outfit?
---
again, yes.
---
If you launch on a public server it wont be solo.  You and 15 of your newest friends will be there.
---
Yeah, just head to a different silo, you're fine
---
It is very much suggested to get some defensive mechanism for a bloodied build.
---
Prefer reduction ones: Blocker, Fireproof, Serendipity.
---
And some constant buff: Barbarian, Ironclad, Evasive, Nerd Rage.
---
With proper build and a good buttressed UNY SS armour you can easily hit 400+dr.
---
If you starting this build get cheap Unyielding armours. And a one star bloodied hand/fixer for commando or lever/hunting for riflemen.
---
You enter with nothing. And yeah just lay low. I made it to lvl 100 in nw with 2 kills. And yup, just hit r1 and you can craft the jumpsuit
---
I don't think it's a good idea making a build specifically around a bug, it's already been in the game for months so sooner or later they'll finally get around to fixing the "magic" weapons. Although I still agree that 2* is a good start, it has the potential for some pretty good weapons even if you don't get exactly what you are looking for
---
So for players like me with a large surplus of the main ammo types I run, how does that affect us?
---
I don't buy, sell, or trade ammo, and I have all I will ever need. By the time I run low on what I have, I already saved up enough materials to bulk craft another large surplus. With the new legendary perk for ammo crafting, I'll then have even more when I bulk craft. 
---
Relying on an "ammo economy" is not something everyone does in this game.
---
9 am for challenges is so convenient.  It helps me get out of bed.
---
Put it on the roof
---
It would be more valuable if was actually what it says it was. I wish it was just a jacket and didn't include the ugly pajamas underneath. They could have given it proper pants to go with it. I got so excited when I got mine from the BOS drop but disappointed when I put it on, then straight to the stash never to be worn again. Maybe it'll go up in value when the BOS return. I have a matching hood too.
---
Not the same guy, distant relatives.
---
Cool man, thanks a bunch!
---
Unyielding has a huge benefit due to the SPECIAL increases. Bonus INT gives you flat XP bonus, bonus AGI gives you more AP, bonus STR gives carry weight and huge bonus on melee if you want it as a side weapon.
---
I dont think cork will ne  easy. I know golf balls and baseballs turn into cork so Whitesprings  Bolton greens and Camden park are probably the best bets. 
---
Globes also turn into cork
---
What do you do with 200 million cork? 
---
Answer: You soak the cork.
---
Just requires several professional cork soakers to soak a cork just a right! lol.
---
Those sell great, can't keep them in stock
---
The only ammo you can sell for more than one cap is fuel, 2mm ec, or ultracite ammo
---
Yeah i read that... hope will get the Maxson¬¥s Family story as the fallout TV show, would be great to adapt
---
Yeah, it seems like it's just not very well thought through. They unbanned cheaters recently so they KNOW exactly how much duped junk is sitting around in mule accounts. Getting rid of the junk is pretty pointless since they just unbanned the cheaters, they'll dupe more of it in a few weeks anyway. Any way you look at it, this event is made to favor cheaters, almost seems like it was *designed* specifically for them
---
I will go right ahead and assume you have better gear than frankenstien Powerarmor and 68 bullets in your fave machine gun once you've played 10x as much as me
---
And double the chances
---
And crystal decanters ... Don't forget to pick up those decanters! I got 1st a couple of weeks ago with the intention of spending just one month building up supplies then cancel and love of it for a while. So far I've got 7k steel (use a lot on ammo) but only approx 500 cork, its one of the rarer scrap items but also not often required.
---
And for 5 sec, its a bit annoying. They should give them a range of some tunes
---
My bad... next time I will pretend like I am talking to a bot. Thank you for your reply.
---
I sell quite a bit, and have invested a lot of time into making a meta shopkeeper game. I do this very thing sort of... I make sure to put like 1 or 2 explosives in there, and ~5 stimpacks, some food, drink, etc.... I do it to make my vendor card on the map look more full. However ammo in mine is 1 cap or 2 for higher caliber
---
I saw a rumor going around that it will be the same plans that dropped from the treasure hunter event, but I have not seen any confirmation for that and honestly don't want to believe it as it would be fairly disappointing
---
I never bought anything until I had to for SCORE events. Looting mats for ammo is a big part of the game for me. I don't appreciate plans or weapons that I bought instead of found.
---
I took a potshot at a vertibird cargobot flying over my camp once for shits and giggles...then Beckett yelled something like, "Now it's on!" and chased the vertibot downhill clear out of my camp. 
---
Ten minutes or so later, I heard gunfire uphill at Sunnytop Ski Lanes (maybe two minutes from my camp at the lead deposit) and I look over there and see the vertibot still being chased by Beckett, but now Beckett's getting chased by the super mutants from the ski lodge, and bringing them all back to my camp because that's the direction the vertibot decided to kite all of them.
---
There's usually an ass ton of bulks at those vendors too, so if you got 1st and caps to burn just buy all that junk too. Before i was vendoring serums i know i would offload a bunch of junk bulks at vendors. But this is a good idea...i might ask via mic at events if anyone is a 1st member and would like to take the bulks, if they're at stations i think lowbies might just grab em for use (which is fine too) or vendor them. Either way it's gonna be real interesting to see how fast these collection events get completed...
---
Yea i want fuel too but i think its just more rare and it involves oil so selling it at 2-3 caps is common...
---
Quest is not broken.   It was abused so it got changed awhile ago.  U can only turn in 1 at a time from picking one up in the open world.
---
At this particular junction, there should be exactly zero tech secrets that BoS is aware of when the Enclave is not.
---
But canon is so...wobbly.
---
When people sell their .50 cal and .308 for 1 cap each, they are the real heroes. Thank you!
---
Confirmed.  My relish farm has been subject to these often.  I have since moved because I don't really need relish anymore but... yeah.
---
I prefer the gauss minigun because the ammo is the easiest to craft, is actually really lightweight with the perk, and because of the way they're crafted, really easy to get a magic legendary effect with (or any other effect you want.)
---
Also the automatic explosive damage is INCREASED BY DEMOLITION EXPERT and grenedier, so for enemy swarms, you can have massive high damage explosions as well as the actual bullets.
---
Also that sweet clandestine paint.
---
What I want to know is can I receive the rewards for doing nothing? What's the bare minimum I have to donate to be eligible? All I want are the double score events so I can finish the run so I can log off until the next major content drops in winter with BOS. Rare plans would be nice but I'd like to know what they are first.
---
On PS4, I‚Äôm selling out of 45 usually within the first 10 minutes of logging in. (Thank you, Legendary Run!) But I do try to keep it in stock more than any other ammo type because I know there are lots of hungry Fixers to feed in the Wasteland. Shotgun and .308 have been selling better than usual lately. Also seems to be a small market for plasma cartridges and plasma cores, which I sell for 1c and 10c respectively. I‚Äôm using the heavy gunner ammo myself, otherwise I‚Äôd be stocking at a cap per. My philosophy is sell everything for cheap and reasonable prices so players don‚Äôt feel like they wasted a fast travel expense to stop by.
---
This is the true reason. Or more specifically, because there are buyers who don't know better. Most things eventually sell.
---
In my vendors, basic plans sell regularly at 10-20 caps each.
---
Fasnacht plans sell for 300 (someone bought 6 different plans yesterday.)
---
The basic Fasnacht masks sell for 100 or so...and the Fasnacht Man mask (the guaranteed drop one) sells for 250 within a day.
---
People sell things for those prices because someone will eventually buy them.
---
" Its ruining the ammo economy. " theres literally noone with .45 or 5.56 ammo, i must do like 5server hops before i reach someone who sells it. Seems like old habbits never die "BAN DUPERS CUZ OUR PIPE weapons economy is ruined!!!"
---
Isnt it just the default suggested price when you put it up for sale?
---
It's just accepting the defaults.
---
Also the fact that you can craft them for cheap. Also, if you have super-duper 3 you can quickly make a lot of these helmets.  Max your charisma (grape mentats, beer, mothman omelet, bobblehead) and sell to a vendor bot for easy caps.  You can max the 1400 caps in a short period of time.
---
It's well known that this game is poorly cobbled together. Yet despite that it has a lot to offer that makes it worth slogging through the lesser aspects of the games systems.
---
It would be most ideal for them to implement a complete rebalancing of all the weapons, enemy stats, and perks, but that will be a long time in coming.
---
If ever, as it's clear they only got a skeleton crew keeping up the illusion of this game being supported till their next money making scheme comes together. 
---
If you can't learn how to bring your own brand of enjoyment to the party then this is probably just not the game for you.
---
Because the way all of you come off is that your jealous of people with better gear and builds who've been playing longer and optimized their characters.
---
And you don't need legacy or magic weapons to be putting out loads of great damage.
---
Inevitably Bethesda needs to fix their game and you would make better progress campaigning them to rebalance it than trying to convince the bulk of players to just give up using over powered builds because you cant speed farm score.
---
If the game pisses you off that much then just go play something else.
---
Just pretend you are a low level vault dweller that just came out and you need to explore what's left of west virginia! Photographing new species and plantlife, revisiting old stomping grounds, nuke everything the possibilities are endless
---
Same here.   I have only had it happen 3 times in the year-plus since I decided to move my  C.A.M.P up into a tree, so I always have to pay them a visit just to see the differences.
---
I think a lot of people buy ammo they don‚Äôt use, to convert to ammo they do use. Just a guess though... I think the 40 mm grenades go for like 80 or 90 ammo credits a piece in that machine.
---
There are also a bunch of bags behind R&amp;G Processing, near Site Charlie
---
I try and stock everything at low prices, but that always ends up with me not having a lot of good stuff at my vendors lol.
---
You new here? Lol......jk....it's been well established that Bethesda isn't capable of things that appear extremely simply to fix/ implement. And as far as them saying anything, they avoid making any statements regarding game mechanics/ functions. My guess is that the code is such a mess they're afraid to mod anything because Everytime they do something completely unrelated breaks. i.e. fixing 250dr WEP perk and breaking most armor effects, breaking adrenaline just to name a couple.
---
I always sell Fuel for 1, but it's very hard to find in the wild.  They REALLY need to make ammo drops/spawns more uniform.  Or just you know re-balance weapons and ammo from the ground up.
---
Assaultron makes me peepee in my pants.
---
You only need 10,000 people over 5 days to deposit 12,500 steel each so not that much if you double the number of people to 20,000 then each would only have to deposit 6,250 easily doable
---
The man mask isn‚Äôt a guaranteed drop
---
They're apparently implementing something like that for the ammo trader in this next patch. Why not do it for everything?
---
Make an awesome camp! Upgrading my camp is one of the main reasons I play, the need for plans for specific items/materials will force you out to the wasteland with an objective!!
---
5 cap/ea rounds are what's going to get rid of the raiders, the hidden costs of running a gang
---
Been playing for the past week like 4 hours minimum a day... no crashes.
---
I was never around for beta.   That's just untrue.   I haven't tried it with my latest alt because I hate to "waste" the discovery until I find out that they've fixed it.
---
1 match. Just survive for 15 minutes or so. Hide in bushes.
---
Adding a couch or a workbench near the spawn location where you can click to it helps me or than running that is.
---
Felt like an action movie (until the end lol), thank you!
---
because people used to use .45 and 5.56 ammo for direct trades. as in "ill give you 1000 .45 for your legendary" but now that people are making 1000 rounds every ten minutes the value of the bullets for direct trades has tanked.  
---
and people arent selling them because these are the two most used ammo types for ballistic weapons.
---
I wish this were true - wife and I launched our first nuke a few weeks ago on a Saturday evening to complete I Am Become Death, and not a single person showed up. Very disheartening.
---
10,000 people delivering 12,500 steel each over 5 days is easily doable. Its cross platform. Farming cork will be the biggest problem as can only get from golf balls, baseballs and globes
---
Honestly though, that makes sense for the trend that Bethesda follows for recycling old content into "new" events. Even if it is lame.
---
Lol i was looking for heavy explosive weapons would try and get them myself but rng gods hate me
---
Pc problems
---
Shovel: hot. 
---
Aluminum can detected in American soil. Can crusher engaged.
---
"Fallout is not an rpg" is one of thee dumbest things I have ever heard
---
I don‚Äôt see the correlation, but okay. They‚Äôll probably port a version of Automatron over from Fallout 4 at some point so true Fallout fans can have their version of ED-E/Fisto/Etc.
---
Plus... Why would a FO1st player even try to farm junk on a public world? Why bother competing with others for it, when the scrap is guaranteed on Private.
---
The things we carry for extra weight, and complain about because we have to have a separate perk card slot to reduce the weight of.
---
Didn‚Äôt we get new weapons added last month? Maybe it was 2 months ago
---
There is one in the asylum and in the train yard north of whitespring.
---
Guaranteed spawn is the correct language I suppose.
---
Perfect thank you so much
---
You dont need to deliver 6,000 steel every minute. You need 10,000 people delivering 12,500 steel each over 5 days. Its cross platform its easily done so every one needs to dump like 2500 steel each day towards it.
---
I want the rewards but the brotherhood are a bunch of losers
---
But if they take out the scorched then yeah I guess they can stay
---
I know there is a small grave outside Huntersville where they fighting them, I'm not sure they fought at West Tech. I think they, Bethesda, intended to have something under Huntersville. There is a buried doorway there by the water tower, hoping it comes into play.
---
It‚Äôs a lot of work to keep vending machines supplied for sure. There have been times when I‚Äôve fallen behind on stocking or ran out of decent items to sell that I‚Äôve put a machine or two in storage. I‚Äôm sure things will quiet down after the legendary run. That daily challenge has been generating a lot of camp visits.
---
I sell all ammo for 1 per (including fuel). Look me up if you‚Äôre on xbone, I usually have a decent amount of fuel in stock as it doesn‚Äôt usually sell often until someone comes along and just buys all of it at once.
---
not everyone does, but now there is one less thing people are willing to trade for, so the remaining items "flux, rare weapons, etc" are going to be farmed by more people, leading to a flood of those items which will cased them to be devalued. and so on and so on.  
---
instead of farming bullets, those players are now either not going to bother with trades at all, or are going to join the nuke zone groups grabbing flux.  
---
It may not directly impact your bullet supplies but it will impact trading in some form.
---
Because sometimes people buy them, and not everyone knows the value of everything.
---
Besides the whole 'levels don't mean anything', it probably doesn't help that there isn't much of a guide on the player vendor prices anywhere, and the in game pricing structure simply doesn't relate at all.  
---
For me, ballistic ammo is typically 1 cap per, and fusion cells along side them.  Plasma though, that's kinda tough, and that's before the weirdness of fusion and plasma cores.  Missiles are basically pointless, and I doubt there are many people willing to give up the weight allowance for mini nukes.  
---
And I mean, that's *just* ammo, that's not even taking into consideration other basic commodities like plans and other consumables such as bobbleheads/magazines, healing items (hey, someone might need stimpacks/radaway) or the largely objective nature of certain legendary mods (bloodied/junkies anyone?) and the pita looking around the market actually represents due to typos and numerous ways of presenting info before we even look at the complete lack of implemented player to player trade.  Then again, it's not like they can really justify a centralised exchange either.
---
Yes that‚Äôs a guaranteed spawn not a guaranteed drop. A guaranteed drop would mean you got it every time you did the event
---
Pets? I just want the fucking ammo converter to work right. Some bethesda employee made a big show of responding to a thread about it claiming it was being worked on but that was over a month ago üôÑ
---
Depending on how long you have owned the game you may not even have to play a match.  Somewhere between 6 months and a year ago there was a weird bug that gave people a TON of perk packs even if you never had touched the mode before.  I started with 180 perk packs at level 0.
---
Check your perks and see if there is an option to open perk packs at the bottom of the screen.  If so just open them as fast as you can in the lobby.  Getting duplicate cards will destroy the duplicate and give you xp and overseers tickets .  I was able to hit level 10 without even playing a match.
---
Oh is it? Dang I just remember him saying to make it comfy because his knee was f up? Might have mentioned ‚Äúchair‚Äù but didn‚Äôt say what kind.
---
I came across one of these near wayward the other day, he had set a macro set to keep jumping behind his locked doors, but after some quick jet packed marsupial jumps i made it to the top platform where more than 16 of these were. I quickly robbed him and hacked the terminal to make 308 and left. LMAO
---
Again you‚Äôve said can‚Äôt stand working with people new, not the case like I have said MANY TIMES, I‚Äôm not exactly a pro myself, I just don‚Äôt want idiocy, and I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs too much to expect tbh
---
Atomic Shop.
---
After spending the past month doing little more than server-hopping in a vain attempt to find what I'm looking for.  It seems like all the good weapons are either legacies, or are reserved for trading.  Nobody actually sells anything at their vendor worth a damn.  Everyone's trying to unload the same "\_\_\_\_\_ slayer's" garbage.
---
copied this text and sent it to bethesda‚Äòs support, immediate refund for 1500 atoms and i got to keep the bundle aswell. thanks, didn‚Äòt even know it was bugged!
---
Just buy from vendors. You can still find good stuff. No need to use outside markets IMO
---
Got it. Slightly off on wording.
---
Regardless, its guaranteed.
---
I logged in yesterday, was spawning in where my CAMP usually is, and I got the "We cannot place your CAMP" message. I was just going to run a couple of small things, so I decided to stay on that world.   
---
I then watched as the game....placed my normal CAMP in the normal spot...
---
I don't hide, I literally play actively getting kills. I would like variety in the maps, flatwoods has plenty of built up areas to fight over.
---
You take duper‚Äôs and fo1st members out of that equation and you aren‚Äôt coming close to hitting that number. I‚Äôm sure the people who have more than 5k steel aren‚Äôt using the normal stash. This entire event is reliant on fo1st members. Or people who play all day long.
---
That‚Äôs the point of the post... if a bloodied build dies just as often as a full health build, what‚Äôs the point of full health builds anymore? Either they need a buff or bloodied needs a huge nerf
---
Admittedly, I‚Äôm the first person, but with less hate.
---
*Because I know they‚Äôll pay me back in full, one way or another.*
---
Also because I don‚Äôt have the materials to give up. Fallout 1st really would‚Äôve been nice. ‚ÄòRare‚Äô plans aren‚Äôt really enough to incentivize me. I‚Äôve got most of them already.
---
I recommend that setting
---
I made an alt about a month ago and have been collecting things like crazy, but I went to craft something and ran out of steel. I was thinking how can I run out of steel. I had 450 ballistic fiber in my scrapbox but only 35 steel. The only thing I can figure is that I accidentally took it out of my scrapbox and then died because I rarely use steel.
---
Hey, I'd like to grab some of those .50 cal rounds
---
It‚Äôs okay, the C.A.M.P. just hasn‚Äôt loaded in for him yet :)
---
You forgot to add "turn off team fill" before you go hiding in a bush.  You'll most likely piss off one or more of your team mates if you go join and bush wookie.
---
Bulletin boards.
---
Oh heck whoops
---
For early early players in high-enemy spawn areas, floating camps are an intelligent move. Until I built up my junk and levels a bit, I had either a floating camp or a destroyed one. Now I've got a southern mansion, better placement (still loads of enemy spawns), and loooooooots of junk to fix shit.
---
seems more to me like they are hoping that dupers clear out some, if not all, of their junk.
---
Really???? I always have hundreds and hundreds of fuel and i have never seen anyone using a flamer so I thought that it was junk, like flares or cannonballs, and so i always trade it for points! I have never even come across a flamer of any kind in drops either.
---
I gave a guy a $20 for a tip, cuz he really really helped me out in punta cana.   He was stunned.  An hour later i figured out the financial landscape.  A $2 woulda been sufficient and wonderful.  Its all about what you know or dont know.   I put ammo in my store so we can exchange 1 cap items for score...  didnt think it thru and put all my .38 and .45 on there....
---
Who wants to scroll thru 3,000 to get to 1 (three times)????
---
Reduced each to a couple hundred rounds...
---
Methinks i am lvl 170 and i sell 5000 cap items for 50 c‚Äôs.     I almost nuked a camp yesterday that sold everything for 10x the suggested price.
---
Dumbass
---
I also undersell a lot of my stuff as I just like the idea of selling what I find than for a profit. I make at least 1k in one play through this way.
---
Some of the aren‚Äôt concept art, it‚Äôs just images you find in photo frames in the game
---
I must be the only one waiting for 5 minutes gang then.
---
FO1st members are a part of the community. And to be fair there is likely way more than 10,000 people across platforms playing probably more like 50,000 considering it's on game pass also. With that many you would need to put 2,500 a day each. Without FO1st that's possible.
---
Person #6: Hey, I bet this type of junk is going to sell well, I should put some in my vendor and get caps while the rubes to the legwork.
---
Person 5:  Looks like I need to fat-walk my mule over to the middle of nowhere.  Oh wait, these are supposed to be community goals?
---
Ok, you get the steel, ill get the cork.
---
Like i said before very time consuming and a wast of caps
---
At Packtray's C.A.M.P., our prices have never been above one cap/round, no matter the calibre. That's the Packtray Difference. See it for yourself on any XB1 server where Packtray is found.
---
My friend and I were discussing this last night. I said that the collectron will probably be the same voice and have similar dialogue to the Liberty prime power armor because the BoS have limited imaginations.
---
I haven‚Äôt read too much about the atlas event....but why can‚Äôt you just deposit your mats to the same place as someone with FO1st?  Do lower amounts count differently?
---
When that happens and you move to another world after does your house show up? or do you have to replace it? I have always been scared to say and look because I could never re-place my camp?
---
My advice. Get a mic and join public teams.  Start chatting with people and try to get some regulars to play with.  It makes the game so much more fun in my opinion.
---
that's where they keep their projectile eggs
---
I did fail my first I am death.  Ton of people showed up but they were like level 20's.  It a right of passage the wasted nuke(or the missed nuke).  You learn to look at the server and if people are active.  Havent failed one since that wasnt glitched with the queen flying to sutton or whatnot.
---
New map: Inside of the Whitespring ( pistol and melee weapons only) yayayayaya
---
the go for silly prices. trade only. legacies. multiple high end guns etc.
---
why woud you put the "supplies" in any stash.. just bring it straight to atlas..? no?
---
It is very very valuable
---
I'd hate to get stuck in a bog ditch though LOL
---
Well then guess im lucky ?
---
I want an Eyebot that goes around, advertising my sales, and encouraging people to come buy my crap.
---
For me it's the holes that make things nasty, I don't know why. Bumping things are still nasty, but once the thing inside comes out it's instant goosebumps and I feel sick.
---
ü§Æ
---
Guess im in luck then
---
I think at the time we also didn't understand that you drop the nuke slightly south of the fissure so the queen can be kited outside of the nuke zone. It was only a week or so after our first attempt at joining in on someone else's Scorched Earth.
---
I'm kind of person 3, but not fully. Still, Ad fucking Victorium.
---
Next update -
---
Anyway, here's Wonderwall.
---
If I gotta use plastic or oil to make it, it goes to 2 caps
---
As great as angry turtle is, he has mainstreamed those glitches weapons. I saw a queen die in less than 3 sec today, kinda stupid tbh.
---
On pc i managed to sell some okay rolled 1-2star weapons for 500-750 caps. Some stimpacks for 10caps each. Junk that i have no need for like aluminium, springs, lead, and black titanium. 5.56 ammo for 1 cap each sells pretty well every now and then too. If people arent buying its probably not what they are looking for or it is over priced..
---
I didn't even install a vending machine nor look at a player vender until I was like level 115. Though I would never sell nor buy ammo at that price.
---
During the event there isnt any point as you can drop straight off your steel. But I dont mind letting someone access my stash box and storing it for them so they can collect it at start of the event
---
Seriously.  I‚Äôm thinking yeah I‚Äôve gots lots of all that... wait... cork?
---
But that only impacts players who rely on trading. I dont trade at all, the trading aystem in this game is terrible and too easy to be scammed by. I play to be self sufficient, and I make sure to farm when I need to for materials to keep that up. Caps are easy to come by because I sell serums for about 100+ caps less than almost every else. Players will come and buy my entire stock and nearly max me out on caps. I just disable my vending machines until I spend my caps and have more inventory to restock it with. 
---
Also, duoers existand have all of those materials in obscure quantities already. I doubt those items will become the next cap replacement.
---
Some people just want what they put in the vendor to last awhile. I price my ammo slightly higher, but put my guns/armor at great rates. 
---
If I put 1k 556 in at 1 cap it‚Äôs gone in 30 seconds. 
---
2 caps makes people think a bit before just spam buying. 
---
3 caps and they really look at everything else before thinking about it. 
---
Unless they have presents... then they just take what they want.
---
Yeah, it was a bit of a joke my comment. I just feel it so immersion braking seeing those. Also i see on here people talk a lot about getting attacked at their camp. It rarely happens to me and i move every week and never think about spawn points.  But for sure if you want to camp next to West Tek entrance door (Which you can) then expect to get attacked.
---
Mines on a hill overlooking Crater. Comes in handy.
---
Crashing while loading into a server auto completes challenges. It happened to me once (during double score weekend, ugh), and it happened to a myriad of other people who all crashed while loading in. 
---
Bethesda will do fuck all about it.
---
I don't like those either though. I win because I'm playing, I'm playing because of score.
---
They mean from now up to atlas so they can farm also
---
Ideally, you‚Äôd want to donate as much mats as possible during a limited amount of time for each of the needed mats. Being able to stockpile these mats before and during the event greatly enhances the amount of individual rewards you can obtain, as well as your overall contribution to the community pool.
---
They mean farm now until atlas starts and store in someones fallout 1st scrapbox
---
Go play Wastelanders and tell me that there's "no real story or plotline." The Secret Service beg to differ.
---
lol  i have Fallout 1st
---
The glitch involved in creating them removed any legendary properties.
---
Person 5: how much scrap do I need to give to unlock the provisions box, what's the chances of rare loot and what's my average amount needed for a rare plan
---
This is me, fuck the brotherhood fuck the old ways
---
The enclave though, I could get behind them
---
I sell all ammo for 1 cap, flood the market
---
I received the actual weapon with 2 alive, but haven't seen the plan yet.
---
I see what you‚Äôre asking, you use our stash boxes as pre-stores before the event so you can start hoarding.
---
I‚Äôm down, I‚Äôm on Xbox and play almost daily so usually around.
---
Yeah but you could get them from killing blood eagles when wastelands first came out.. that's how they exist in ps4 and xbox
---
I get what they're saying, but I'm pretty sure the Appalachian BoS only become such assholes after they lost contact with Maxson, therefore losing his guidance.
---
Caps are worthless. If you just sit in a public team, there is a passive income if someone else finish a quest. Also, you can make 1400 from the vendors and who knows how much more from the daily quests.
---
We used ammo as a secondary currency, but since the ammo factory glitch, they will lose their value too very soon.
---
I sell everything either 1, 11, or 111. It's just whatever number is less than and closest.
---
I used to do half but too much work. I'd rather just sell stuff and get it out of my stash or help someone who needed it.
---
I'll collect all the bears and sell them for 1 cap for collectors.
---
Hello. I read your other post about playing with melee and heavy weapons and i have two weapons that might interest you, both junkies and 90% weight reduction
---
It‚Äôs all about building a stockpile of mats before and during the event, with non-1st players severely restricted in the amount they can save in their own stashes.
---
Lol please not. Classical pieces instead
---
how would you balance this?
---
"As long as there's some noob out there who will buy it when they're in a pinch, I'll sell for that much" - probably said about every high-priced item in every player vendor in this game
---
Things I make constantly and sell for 1 cap a piece!    Over last weekend I think I sold upward of 6000 in one day of 5.56 and .45's.    The minute or so investment to make em and sell what you already have is worth it.
---
No, you get individual provisions for donating personally that provide a chance for rare plans.
---
Oh cool! How many c@ps were you thinking?
---
Couldn‚Äôt tell you. Just logged onto test. Instantly placed in full lobby. 
---
Maybe Xbox is different?
---
This may be true, like an old banjo, but it is so much fun to use up all the ammo!
---
In economics 101, you r correct.  In reality, its pathetically easy to grind out a couple thousand rounds and super-duper and ammosmith more..
---
I buy 1 cap ammo every day.  More than 1 cap?  I just make my own.   Your results may vary.  Some settling of contents may occur during shipment
---
I'm on xbox GT lowlifescarab86 on most evenings UK time happy to store people's steel, concrete and cork and keep a log of it and give it back when needed
---
Are you on PC?
---
I have been grinding for t60 plans and bos paints for three weeks and am determined to get at least the paladin set before they drop. I am definitely a no. 3
---
Good lord I hate them. I can kill them in like 10 secs if they would just land but they keep flying around using that stupid sonic blast god damnit! I enjoyed skyrim dragons more than these flying shits...
---
This. 
---
I had someone a few weeks ago try and justify his prices by saying "with the current dupe method going on everyone will have more caps so they'll be willing to pay higher prices."
---
Exactly! And thanks so much, hopefully a fellow X-box‚Äòer takes you up on this kind offer!
---
Waste of caps? Prices in vendors are like 10% of what you will be asked to pay in those outside trading groups.
---
Weird. I‚Äôve played pretty much all month for 4-6 hour periods at a time and haven‚Äôt had any issues with crashing.
---
I‚Äôm level 219. All ammos in my vending machines 1 cap. Or good trade offer. This is the way.
---
yeah youre right about that 
---
hope well learn more next week
---
I'm almost level 200 and I sell all my plans for 20% of the recommend price. If I could sell ammo for less than a cap I would. Right now I just want to be convenient for others so they can buy something for their daily quest or help new players. The whole fallout economy was rigged from the start so who cares.
---
A new legendary armor perk
---
famished: ‚Äúput cool effect here‚Äù
---
When starving 
---
Everything else like vanguard and berserkers need a buff or something
---
Yes, but if you are being strategic you can start saving for the next junk item on the list, and then the next and so forth.
---
Well why do they not have it for SS armor but every other armor?
---
No worries. If you change your mind, let me know. If you aren't going Bloodied, or Junkies. Take a look into going with a Vanguard setup for armor, and a Vampire's build for weapons.
---
Scum!
---
All that power and just managed to fuck everything up, hell even the raiders are more organized and powerful than the BOS
---
It‚Äôs a good idea! I‚Äôm in the UK as well so you know my time zone ‚úåüèª
---
The new dupe wave will be just junk just wait.
---
Yeah thats true
---
Golf balls in Whitespring and Helmlock Holes clubs
---
The server wide rewards yes.
---
I use my private world to knock out the easy dailies without any completion to slow me down (which is minor, honestly, considering how many options are available), sometimes to farm resources a bit if I‚Äôm low, but then spend more time in Public for events and nuke runs and such. 
---
I hardly bother picking up junk in Public, except for the few things I have tagged like Screws and Asbestos.
---
I‚Äôve been wondering if some of the level 100+ people are just gamepass players who binged there way up, so they‚Äôre still very noobish. I‚Äôve noticed some players seem to sell for the game‚Äôs default pricing, which is wrong but maybe they‚Äôve never cared to learn any different. I sure hope people are paying for that. Ammo is 1 cap in my opinion. Some people do 2 for some and I get it, but I‚Äôll never do that.
---
Rare plans yes, but the rewards are for everyone as long as the challenge is completed right ?
---
Yeah it's a good idea I'm happy to help. If anyone on xbox wants to use my scrapbox to pre store stuff
---
Never too late to join. Won't be an experience like the forest though.
---
Maybe. I do play on PC.
---
Why have u answered a question with a question?  I‚Äôll answer yours. Because it‚Äôs not needed to repair SS armour but is for everything else
---
Also Bolton Greens golf course. Baseballs are also good and can be found at Camden park. Globes yield cork also and can be found in schools etc
---
You can just hold the VATS button and it'll go down to 1 much faster.
---
Im on PC sadly, but it appears the xbox crowd is stepping up to the plate! Thanks and hopefully somebody responds to your kind offer soon
---
Yeah.. A beret and a post with a BOS emblem...
---
The rare plans will be the only thing valuable. Sure the other rewards like purveyor sale and such are good but I feel they would've just put those sales on anyway and this is just a ploy to give us somthing to do
---

---
HOW DO YOU DO THIS!!!!
---
yeah I'm on PC (steam if that matters) normally takes about 2-5 minutes, depends what time you play from what I've seen (tight is faster than day where I live)
---
Modus is a terminal screen mounted on a mannequin, and we get to dress him up like all the others
---
I hate this cap limit will they ever increase it? If a person's buys 20k of 5.56 and im already nearing max then its a waste. Im forced to spend my 30k caps on junk or ammo just to have space for more. I can easily reach capped caps in like 2 days of sells.... What kind of online multiplayer economy has a limit in the amount of money you can hold damnit...
---
Cork
---
-Small putting green northwest of The Whitespring Service Entrance (43 golf ball)
---
This will be the big one. Everyone start raiding now.
---
Maybe you want to make a new post with people who have first boxes already and are happy to help. Maybe simplify the description a bit so they understand they can farm and pre store from now
---
unless they bring it back it will only gain value as plans get used or lost.
---
You don‚Äôt, cork farms you
---
Those are so fun!
---
I've seen a Behemoth fight a Sheepsquatch, a Sheepsquatch fight a Mirelurk Queen (happens a lot in Cranberry Glade), and a Sheepsquatch fight a Deathclaw and a Behemoth.
---
I‚Äôve just never understood why armor over lvl 30 needs ballistic fiber but weapons never needed anything special for repairs. It never made any sense to me. And now the top armor of the game doesn‚Äôt need it but Chinese stealth does? Bethesda just doesn‚Äôt make sense some times.
---
I‚Äôm a level 116 and everything in my vending machines are reasonable. I have a second character who is only a level 12. And man, I am shocked how expensive people put their prices. All my ammo is 1 cap, my food is 3 caps, and my plans are all 20 caps. The only thing I set Relatively high are legendary weapons and armor. But, they‚Äôre usually never over 100 caps. But that‚Äôs just me. I find if I keep my prices low and my machines fully stocked. I get really good foot traffic.
---
Because plastic is hard to find???
---
Thanks mate, wish I wasn‚Äôt on PC because so far the xbox lads are slamming it! Hopefully someone takes you up on this offer soon
---
I meant fast traveling even with the perk
---
It did for me on Tuesday night. I no longer have a way of testing it since I'm now an Ally thanks to this.
---
If you are on PC hit me up, Iiterally just drop it or sell it for 1 cap a piece.
---
Unfortunately this is quite unrealistic, as it would show how poorly implemented many of their items are, and would prevent many people from buying them.
---
Today I browsed a vendor where all plans were 30 caps and there were a lot of good ones, even ones I've never seen (Brain Bombs was one of them). So I was really impressed. This was clearly a player that's been around for a while and didn't really want to earn caps. 
---
Then I noticed missiles for 20 caps each... Huh?
---
Fair point wait aint they bringing it back for atlas
---
They want my plastic!? Flipping Brotherhood...
---
I definitely buy up all the plasma cartridges, if they're 1c.
---
Plasma flamer runs through it in a hurry, and the ammo machine (from the Raiders) caps plasma at 33
---
i have like 20.000 glass 
---
I never use it for anything i think, except some repairs.   
---
Im a big looter btw
---
only wastelander stuff
---
Really? I found a guy selling it for 35 caps. Needless to say my friend bought it immediately
---
Right on, thx for the reply, I guess some of these builds shouldn‚Äôt really be attempted until you have the exact or close to the exact kit, such as ‚ÄúBloodied‚Äù prefix, as you mentioned.
---
You have to be 13 to use this site
---
Im lvl 39 and i just realized yesterday that fusion cores should be priced from 10-50 caps not default price because i had a very angry customer complain. At least i learned i guess and re did most of my pricing. Still would never sell 5 caps a bullet
---
they are used in crafting plans. No not every plan can use them. they so far only work on the Wastelander's weapons/armor and the gear from vault 94 that is  now sold from the Secret service
---
I just try to get rid of the excess, and I get to help people out. Plus, you‚Äôre more likely to blow 400-500 caps if it‚Äôs a good deal üòéü§ôüèº
---
I did this with fusion cores ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è got 2 when I thought I was getting 15
---
You use the modules to craft  items from wastelanders.
---
Depends on the level of the seller for me. If they are new I will buy to give them caps. At level 250+ I don‚Äôt need caps and if I don‚Äôt want to craft the ammo I will buy it. Why not? 
---
If you care that much about price, make it yourself and then you won‚Äôt be upset. Easy peasy.
---
Sign me up for #3.
---
They only work for the new wastelanders gear so secret service armour, plasma caster and gauss weapons.
---
It‚Äôs pretty obvious. I‚Äôve read so many posts and everyone says that their game crashed right before then when they finally get on they have the auto complete bug.
---
Traveling pharmacy and bandolier, Carry all your Chems and ammo. Bear arms, carry all your heavy guns. High capacity backpack, 120 additional carry weight. Mule characters. Don't pick up weapons you aren't going to use or scrip. There's a bunch of ways to manage this without paying for 1st.
---
You are correct. The legendary modules are for the plans you buy with gold bullion. Since RNG is horrible, plan to go through a lot of these to get the pieces you want. I think in around 200+ modules burned to get a decent set of Secret Service armor.
---
I wonder if it'll ever come out of "beta."
---
I gave it one more try, figured if I saw another cheater I'd write the mode off  
---
Won the match (auto-grenade cannon thing I found helped a lot) and everyone on the team seemed to be playing legit (couldn't find the last remaining opponent until the very last minute)  
---
So maybe it was just some bad luck to encounter a few in a row
---
There's really nothing that can be done about it sadly. Really wish they'd fix the trading system already
---
I think it‚Äôs really stupid because unless it‚Äôs like 2mm or some type of very rare ammo it should be 1 cap a piece
---
I sale all my ammo for 1 cap a piece except for specific energy ammo and that's 2 a piece. Xbox player. What gets me is people selling stuff at 4 times the on something stupid. I get guns bc they are worth it. I'm a newer player only 4 months in so I don't really understand armor pricing or even what the best armor to run is. But I'm lvl 153 and the community has been very good to me. I now have my first legacy thanks to a very generous high lvl player. Vampires scattershot explosive Gatling plasma üòÅ
---
Working on my serums as well!  Seems those fly out the door if you keep them less than 500 caps.
---
It‚Äôs been nice not worrying about caps and being able to drop a chunk on a decent weapon to try out.
---
I only ever have like 15 or 20 fuel, but that is because I always put it up for sale for 1 cap each and it is always sold before the end of the day. I never see anyone use a flamer, but they buy my fuel, so I don't care.
---
This sucks, but some people gotta learn somehow
---
Your post reminds me of my marketing texts for my vendors in Star Wars Galaxies. Those were the times :) :) I love it when people do stuff like that in a game.
---
there are like 3 or 4 in the legendary run. Im sure theyll bring BoS PA skins in the next run
---
Or, Bethesda will update the existing gifts to drop the new rewards and they will again be rewarded because Bethesda is incompetent.
---
I def like the idea of aggro weapons, that'd actually be pretty awesome. Full health "unyielding" could work but it'd need some crazy balancing. Honestly tho i'd be happy if they just take out nocturnal shit completely and maybe replace it with something like this, made for people who want to go full tank mode. Currently tho you can run a pretty decent full health junkie build (expecially if you have a "magic" weap) and do just fine at full health, if you want the extra specials tho, i think it's fair that your forever on the brink of "death"
---
Ahh ok thanks that makes sense, I think I‚Äôm way off legendary weapons yet tho lol x
---
There‚Äôs not really a recourse. Giving an opinion that certain gear is subpar isn‚Äôt something you can regulate.  And it could even be argued that since this is a role-playing game, if all that was used was *words and acting*, and no system manipulation, then it‚Äôs 100% fair game. They were playing the role of a con artist, within the confines of the game world, and succeeded. 
---
Let‚Äôs compare this to a real-world RPG, like Dungeons and Dragons. If Player A convinces Player B that they should donate their treasure to Charity X (which turns out to be a scam) and does so in-character only, that‚Äôs within the rules. Unless Player A made some sort of external threat or coercion (real person to real person), then it‚Äôs part of the game. 
---
Now, is it a crummy thing to do?  Of course. 
---
But are there any punitive consequences that can be applied?  Unlikely.
---
The fridge!
---
I'm constantly picking shit up and only have 200 plastic with how much shotgun ammo and arrows I use. Compared to the 1000s of other components I have for other ammo, yes. It's hard to find and used quite frequently which makes it rare in my case. If you melee, plastic may not be a problem. It's always barely a problem for me.
---
The glitch to make them also worked on consul. And no there are no legendary nw weapons
---
Same here. I also played some time after release and then dropped out. Shortly after Wastelanders I had a new start with a fresh character. After some grinding on the double XP weekend I'm now level 550 (gained 160+ levels on the last double xp weekend thanks to lunchboxes).
---
Since the slider is such a pain, many just use the default cost when they post something for sale.
---
Good idea mate, I'll ad a tldr at the bottom of the post. Simplifying an issue has never been a strong point of mine...
---
Trading posts, including price checks, are not allowed on /r/fo76. There are other trading/price checking subreddits and websites available - please make use of those. 
---
If your post is not about making a trade, please [message the subreddit moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/fo76) and they'll take a look at your post for you.
---
I play NW with my husband, we play quite a number of matches everyday. Last night we were getting shot/killed by someone clearly shooting through the map (pointing at the ground and shooting to kill people). 
---
That was obviously a cheater, a few days before someone obviously had walls and aimbot. I was behind something, stepped out, guy also behind something stepped out and immediately one shot me. Absolutely no way he saw where I was. While spectating it looked like he was flicking oddly with no one around and shooting crates as he looted.
---
We've only had a few cases where it's been very obvious they are cheating, some that seemed questionable but might be lag/latency issues, and some that are very subtle but there's clearly some kind of cheat happening.
---
I don't think it's as bad as people are making it seem, but there definitely are cheaters. I'd keep playing, if you see something odd that might be a cheater just leave and queue again so you're not immediately matched with them for the next game.
---
People keep asking what the fun is in one shotting in survivor mode, it's cheaters in NW that I don't understand. What kind of loser must you be you need to cheat to win? You just know they are terrible without cheats.
---
I refuse to use the trading menu. I know someone IRL who lost good shit twice using the trade menu. 
---
If I have anything available for trade, it's in the vending machine. I either charge MSRP or lower so it isn't like I'm doing the 1500-3000c sales.
---
This is the greatest comment section I‚Äôve ever seen üòÇüòÇüòÇüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª
---
THIS. YES PLEASE
---
As much as I like 76, it is not a survival game. It's survival mechanics are shallow and boring.
---
But it's still a fun game.
---
reminds me when vending was disabled I had someone message me asking if I could trade them the plasma cores that were sitting in my vending machine. I had 10 of them and gave them all of them for free just because they took the time to ask.
---
about sums it up
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs fair...er, I suppose. I imagine it‚Äôs real shitty to have to carry a bunch of AFK players. I‚Äôm not sure what the perfect formula is, but maybe not going all in on one kit type and just having a side kit of fast DPS just for SBQ fights.
---
Please, it‚Äôs nuclear winter that is garbage. Nobody asked for it, and eventually Bethesda neutered PvP in adventure mode to satisfy the care bears. Plenty of other games offer battle royale and do it better.
---
Switch and wait for One Appalachia.
---
You're right! Drink faster PastaDelicious
---
So true. I'm a bit of a shopaholic myself : /
---
I build. And rebuild again. Shopping vendors. Great way to get build ideas. Take a break if you need to, many of us have done that too.
---
I usually wait for events and inbetween them I might go do a west tek run or something. I fiddle around with my base alot, changing and tweaking things. Sometimes I will go and farm some specific items to create ammo or serums. Sometimes I just cbf and I turn the game off.
---
Hah my exact thought when I saw the post title!
---
Actually it's probably around 200 modules.
---
I checked my inventory and I have 13 cork lol (I‚Äôm lvl 35). I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be able to contribute too much ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I‚Äôll try my best!
---
Fast travel
---
No idea. I know there'll be rare plans but haven't looked into what rare plans
---
White Springs has a tun of cork, although that number is pretty crazy.
---
That‚Äôs possible but unconfirmed so far. IIRC they‚Äôve said you can get plans *like* you did from Gifts &amp; Pails, but not explicitly stated that all the same plans will exist.
---
So if you think it will come back, the value may drop and you‚Äôd want to make a move soon. If you think it won‚Äôt, holding on to it is the better choice. 
---
It‚Äôs like the stock market... except you can‚Äôt depend on government bail-outs.
---
They aren't leaving them in so when I do create a character and they aren't there I don't buy. For instance I just created a raider character based on a weapon I found. However the items aren't there anymore. So I don't buy them since they don't exist in the shop. Maybe I'll create another character based on stealth later because of another weapon or I find something interesting in the world. I have no interest now but maybe I will later. I won't buy it now because I don't need it now.
---
Tried that, but it didn't work...
---
Definitely fun, especially with friends, and not too late to join, but won't be the same survival experience as the forest. The survival aspects are there but not in focus in any way. Would definitely recommend if you like rpgs and it looks fun to you.
---
I did it in 2 double XP events. It wasn‚Äôt fun and I won‚Äôt be touching the game mode again.
---
Ah ok im gonna keep a hold of it - its a second one for me anyway so I‚Äôll keep it for now
---
Used to be rare, they were duped though. People thought it was only things that could be sold to vendors but that's not true. I've seen it sell in the market for caps and found 3 in a vendor for 5k. Only had one drop legit from the event, was pretty rare.
---
Supposedly someone is still duping, but they always say that. Wouldn't doubt it though!
---
I play with friends I've met in game. I get more enjoyment from doing wierd stuff with them than I ever did the quests of the game. 500 hours so far in game and I still play every day without fail lol the 40 bucks I spent was well worth it.
---
If i understood correctly, one appalachia will.make (for me) all of the enemies everywhere my level, i don't need to fight for eg at l 230 a l15 scorched right?
---
If it actually works that way? I'm in on xbox, usually on in evenings est, try kickedurchin6
---
Everytime I‚Äôve reached level 200 I‚Äôve made a new character other than that I will rebuild my camp or take over a workshop and build up all the stuff and then build a cool little town or business or something on the plot they give you. If I don‚Äôt want to do that I nuke but no one has been doing the queen so I‚Äôve been nuking random spots on the map to see what happens to them.
---
Doubt,  u/eckserah would have to do a delta on prior versions
---
High school in Morgantown and the one in Watoga have tons of plastic in them.
---
It's stupid that it wasn't fixed already after 8+ months. Any other online game this wouldn't last half a week.
---
I thought you couldn‚Äôt dupe plans
---
That lvl 225 sucks at pvp..... lol
---
I will be on vacation during the steel event. Will I still get the cap?
---
Its just those two "systemic"  weapon and armor lists
---
I started f4 today, again and again, good ideea I never played it on 4k before and with a woman character hehe
---
You could. It was public too.
---
Barbarian and ironclad probably won‚Äôt do him much good since he‚Äôs a commando. I just phased them both out of my melee build and have had better results, since dr doesn‚Äôt do a lot after 350ish
---
Someone had them for sale for like 12k caps, and I was like GTFOutta here with that markup. But that was the only time I‚Äôve seen ‚Äòem. But yeah, total nonstarter if there aren‚Äôt a number of 250+ lvl people on the server and then are willing to come in and do it.
---
I think so. This makes the whole map and all the events worth of the grind.
---
I'm also sick of Morgantown. I vote Flatwoods every time and still 90% of the time, it ends up Morgantown.
---
I wish they'd move it out of "Beta" and add from the rest of the map. Cranberry Bog? Toxic Valley? The Mire with all it's darkness and danger?
---
I bet people would still stick with Morgantown
---
How to trade safely:
---
Step 1 - Don't.
---
Huh never was told that one only knew about weapon and armour but never would dupe anyway so never cared
---
Awesome, cheers mate! And, insofar as its my current understanding based on what I could gather from here and the latest ITV, it should all fit well overall.
---
we.... are.... MODUS!!!
---
It‚Äôs just to earn them caps,speaking of which I‚Äôm rap as a wandering trader
---
Yep, this will.be a cool update, I will finally make those tea pot events and guests event
---
I mean it would be just as broken if you have a vampire weapon
---
I am the same way the only ammo I sell for more is nukes missiles and cartridges. And even those only go for at the most 5.
---
All of the bloodied build perks and some addictions
---
This would make a sick discord. Literally just banking. And you could charge X amount of whatever to keep it stored. I have FO1st for and Xbox, I‚Äôd be down.
---
This is legit reason right there. Made this mistake myself.
---
I wait until I have plenty of modules, like 50 or 60 and start rolling. If I don't get anything good after 20 I just stop and rebuild my supply. I've got a full Unyielding set, only one of which was the roll I was looking for. I've probably burned about 150 or so modules on the secret service gear.
---
I've had it go away after a few minutes but it usually requires leaving the server.
---
i got 3 UNY and 2 Bolstering out of my first 20. RNGesus blessed me.
---
Oh why? I so wanted it. Been waiting for the Survivalist for long...
---
Just so I understand - you give the mats to your adopted buddy and they put them in their scrapbox (not stashbox since that is limited to 800 and scrapbox is unlimited). Then, during the event, the buddy has more mats to donate.
---
&gt; or maybe even have some experience that it was sold for that price, so they think the price is ok.
---
If someone pays the price, the price _is okay_. I price my 5.56s at 2 caps a piece, because they're in high demand and people will pay it. Given the demand, it would be silly of me to cut my potential earnings in half.
---
I don't have much but I have this C.A.M.P if you want it
---
Where did you target? If you hit prime dead centre you effectively block non-PA players from joining.
---
Good ideea, I will double.my chances of god rolls with 2 characters, especially that i have f1st
---
You‚Äôd be amazed at what sells and at what price. Vending and building are the two fun things for me in the game. Those bullets will sell eventually. I ran an experiment a few weeks ago. Put up 3000 .50cal for 3 caps a piece and 1000 fusion cells for 5caps each. It all sold in roughly a week. I just sell all ammo for 1 cap, but that experiment was pretty interesting. 
---
And if you shop player vendors you can buy low, upgrade the weapon/armor a little and sell high.
---
I sell all my ammo for 1 cap. If it's in the vending machine, I don't use/want it and wanna clear inventory space. In fact I pretty much sell most of my stuff for way under what I see other players ask.
---
I think mainly farmed baseballs. They don't auto scrap so you have to pick them.
---
People are under the impression there is an "economy". But hey if you really need ammo go to Charleston fire station and find the weight room. I walked out with 96 lead in one trip. Shit was fire. Munitions factory is kinda trash. You get about 200 5.56 rounds every 30 minutes or so but then you waste half defending it. There's also this high rise monorail place you can visit that has weights laying around at the entrance as soon as you step off the elevator. Idk if you're actually in need of ammo or just griping about dumb people but these 2 locations can get you going.
---
It‚Äôll also help with the level up every day which is just killing my spirit
---
Yeah, this is what happened. We realized after the fact.
---
Same thing happened to me.... kinda of sad i guess. I wanted to complete the quest and get the achievement and actually launch the nuke all on my own.  I was saving that quest and getting the codes and stuff ready. I joined a team with a high lvl 544 guy and didnt know that it would auto complete my quest..The guy  was doing back to back nuke launches  and and i got the quest completed while i was doing some daily event.... oh well
---
If you're on Xbox, I currently have all 50+ units of fuel for sale for 1 cap each lol
---
Actually, they should auto scrap now - Bethesda removed them from the baseball grenade recipe and replaced it with cork.
---
I don't think so, I'm talking about people who play this game and maybe one other game but also do things in real life like doctors/nurses, or travel for a week at a time. These people have not only real income but also a desire to support their only game they play with lots of money. Now these two weeks I'm actually playing is focused on stealth I won't buy a thing because I don't run it. Meanwhile I would've bought the whole shop if they had their raider items. Like I did when they were running the apocalypse riders. There are more fans like this than fo realizes. For instance the entire group I play with.
---
I have a disposable income but I'm also an intelligent consumer. I buy what I need/want, not what is there because it's there. This model is more for children who buy indiscriminately than adults who make up the actual income.
---
Games poorly coded and based on rng instead of actually being thought out, so this is what you get.
---
Yeah, I use Vats as often as my AP lets me. Also, max action boy perk card, etc.
---
I had all but 1 unyielding, that damn left arm lol. Finally got a 3 star bolstering, which is what I'm after now lol. I maybe only have 10 to 12 modules at a time. I cant wait weeks to build up a supply like that. I want to though ha ha.
---
AD VICTORIAM MY BROTHERS
---
I tried to complete the Bogtown with 20 fresh toons, approached from every single possible direction as well as tried to fast travel to my friend and join "Defend Bogtown Workshop" event. After all those boring and painful attempts i can clearly say it\`s still impossible to complete.
---
Oh yeah please. Make the knives 1 hit kill
---
I wanted Vanguard and rolled way over 200 and only got 1 piece and the rest were mostly unyielding and bolstering.  I‚Äôve given up now and not bothering with SS armour.
---
Yeah he hates me lol
---
how did you get that enclave badge next to your name? i want one too
---
My brother uses vanguard and I use unyielding. I get all the vanguard rolls and he gets all the unyielding.
---
If they do this nobody will buy anything, they gotta do false advertisements so their lazyness doesn't show up to the public. Even more so.
---
Ah, good call, thx for the tip. I‚Äôll check it out.
---
&gt; Nobody uses that shit!
---
I use chameleon and auto stim.. also trouble shooters on all of my 3 toons...
---
&gt;When are we going to be allowed to trade and sell this stuff that uses legendary modules? **Probably never.**
---
hopefully not.. otherwise it will be duped to hell and back...
---
No, just no.  Bethesda doesn‚Äôt care about real issues little less kids being stupid as getting taken advantage of.
---
Stop selling non-legendary weapons and armor...no one will buy them
---
Interesting. The things that are nasty to me are the big fat ticks that creep up on you trying to bite into your ankles. Man those things are disgusting lol
---
Yeah its shitty, I have a buddy that gets all the good stuff, and I get crap.
---
I've just finished 4hrs and has just one crash - after I nuked Whitesprings and singlehandedly cleared it (no idea why noone else appeared). Running to the crafting stations after the first circle and...stop...
---
Almost like the game saw I had the potential to do 2 hrs of solo nuke farming and decided I needed to be kicked.
---
Exactly! And damnit to hell, I'll edit the post again to stress the srapbox part - thanks and apologies for the mistake.
---
Maybe they're not interested in moving them unless someone pays 5? Not bullets, but I've put other overpriced stuff in my vending machine before with the attitude, "If it sells, fine, if it doesn't, fine." Every once in a while, someone bites and it's a nice surprise.
---
Oh..ok thanks
---
It should be fine where it was at if you decide to stay on that server for a bit before finding another, you'll just be in a server without your camp till you skip to the next. No need to rebuild! That is assuming the game doesn't boof it up, Bethesda being Bethesda and all
---
I've not been on awhile so the BoS have started some sort of quest?
---
Like everything that‚Äôs really cool, you have to lay Bethesda to get it - fun way to play, no?
---
Yep that how both my build go too.
---
Damn right why are these people trying to sell me bullets at a high taxation and low level weapons that even a noob can loot off a damn ole scorch. The time is now for us to rise and liberate these bargain dealers from their horrendous actions of selling goods at unreasonable prices. Time to fly on my Scorchbeast mount and bring in the calvary. Sonic boom do your impending doom. Amen.
---
better yet why are people selling 5.56 for 2 caps per still?
---
I killed a level 68 when I was level 17, he attacked me first
---
I sell .50 5.56 at 2. Everything else goes for 1.
---
For real Gemini cricket
---
I used to wear mine and not see anyone with it. Had all the plans drop but marine armor helmet, had to trade for that. Spent around 200k caps on those pales and figured it out.
---
Some guys posted they spent like million caps and didn't get anything. Probably used xmas gifts to spend that much. They don't know about juicing (increase chances on new characters opening the gifts) or anything. But yeah it was a thing.
---
Thank you for that! Much appreciated. We talked another one of our WoW guildies into playing Fallout 76, so being able to crank these out will be great for all!
---
I also had a level 1 beaver and it didn't even last a day lol.
---
They are going to be hipster AF and bottle Malaghoulsia
---
I am level 30 and i sell all ammo for 1 cap each. missiles, mini nukes, everything
---
Yeah your use of stashbox confused me. üòÑ. But I‚Äôm easily confused, too.
---
The best workaround for me has been to quit the game, use the restroom or refill my coffee (or sometimes both, but not at the same time), and when I've calmed down come back to the game. It's usually fixed by then.
---
I don't know about that, with the stock i have right now i estimated we'd need about 1500 likeminded people to sort out the first wave, and i'm lvl 110, but then again i also pick up EVERYTHING since i planned to do the "fo1st for two months and then just ride out the stock for a while" thing :p
---
Ah that makes sense i wear mine all the time and was shocked when i got another one
---
&gt;360 for lvl 20 
---
ive got the lvl30 one you get as a reward in my machine for 176c and nobody even looks at it.. lol
---
For the thousands of cork boards the BOS will need to pin their rebuilding plans.
---
I usually play something else or catch up on Netflix.  After finishing all the quests, the end game is all RNG and trying to improve your gear.  Vendor hopping/trading can be fun for a while, but once you get your dream weapons...it starts to get boring again.
---
Took me about 125 modules to get a full Unyielding set.
---
Beer bottles too.  That crap was annoying as hell. I still avoid picking up bottles out of habit even though they scrap now.
---
That makes two of us mate! Thanks again, fixed the post to hide my dumbassery...
---
Don't be so sure, you can start finding legendary weapons and armor at LVL 5.
---
Yeah.. You can 20 modules a week more or less... If you've got a decent build you can live with for a month you can get 80 in the bank.
---
Really? I can't even sell my fasnacht masks for 50 caps. I used to be able to get 1000 for plans if I was patient but I think this time there are less people who didn't get to grind it enough to get the plans they wanted (I know, overpriced. I am pretty cheap on a  lot of things but I like having a few rare items that I can overprice. Guess fasnacht isn't that rare anymore, heh).
---
But yeah, most stuff i just price at what it will sell at quickly enough or I just don't bother selling it at all if the price isn't worth it (so I don't tend to sell much weapons and heavy stuff cause I find it's not worth what I can get to have that weight in my storage box). I don't find that ammo sells at all if it is more than 1 cap (so heavy ammos like the grenades I just don't carry cause it's not worth 1 cap to have that weight in my box).
---
Ah yes the blizzard method "don't diversify, just slap on bigger numbers"
---
Ouch lol I've spent nearly 75 to 100 to try to get that last piece the left arm. Now I've decided to go bolstering lol dummy me.
---
That is entirely subjective. Personally I find the mustache twirling of the enclave to be cliche and entirely boring
---
Ah didn't know thanks. I should go farming more, used to farm all the time before the grind.
---
The Free States bundles really were great quality, but they were also admittedly pretty old as well. They gotta keep cycling in new Atomic shop content, even if the old stuff is still good.
---
I like to do the same, but I always sell the .38 for free. Low level players don‚Äôt have the money to spend on the bullets, and once you get to a certain point there‚Äôs no need to use pipe weapons anyways, and they just add up the space.
---
Yeah my bloodied bear arm doing 1836 dmg, and running 4 UNYIELDING and 1 bolstering.
---
I've got all of mine up for 1c except missiles(2c), auto grenades(5c) and nukes(20c). Eventually someone buys em, or I'd drop those too.
---
Most plans I have at 10c or lower, unless it's something special.
---
People actually buy missiles and mini nukes?!
---
What is your source for that? There would need to be a good reason why the Bethesda launcher number is somehow significantly higher given that Steam is the most popular digital content delivery market in the world and the bethesda launcher leaves a lot to be desired and Steam numbers are on a serious dip atm.
---
Star Wars Galaxies should have never been killed... I miss my speeder and saber.. So much actually I bought a security baton and added electric.. Although it doesn't feel the same as slicing droids and using Nym's Sluggthrower
---
I was thinking of creating a universal average price spreadsheet for all ammo/junk. Nobody done this yet?
---
People only want legendary gear or rare stuff, sorry bud
---
I‚Äôm on PS4 don‚Äôt know if that changes anything for you.
---
People selling cartridges for 2-3 caps was one of the main reasons I switched to ultracite
---
You can just hit LT/L2 to skip the slider along 25%.
---
If I would sell my plans n' stuff I would sell ammo for 1 cap each no matter which ammo type amd my plans and everything except weapons would be pretty cheap.
---
Wobbly? It's a fucking melted ice cream at this point.
---
I only play when my friends pop online now, we still play pretty much every day together though. We do a few Scorched Earths, an Encryptid and sometimes NW if we're feeling the vibe. I'm glad we're getting Colossal problem next week, gives us more to do
---
I'm aware there is nothing Bethesda is going to do about it, wasn't really expecting them to.  We have a pretty good list of interested players now, we will be launching a nuke on the scammers base, on the hour, every hour, for the next week or so anyway.
---
If it's just one player and it usually sells at the price you sell it, than that's just one player who doesn't realize how markets work.  I tend to go by if it sells quick enough for me at the price at how I price it, not on one person's complaint. And if they are being assholes about it I will feel even less compelled to lower it for them.
---
This makes me wish I didn't drop 336 million rounds on the ground rofl. I could be santa Claus gifting 200k 5.56 to each player out there. I just kept 200k for myself on my alt and 70k on my main to use.
---
Probably the same reason you see 500cap water. They are hoping you don't pay attention and buy.
---
And I'm so grateful because I never have enough ammo and haven't been playing long enough to amass a fortune in caps. This community overall is fantastic. Everyone is so nice even when you're making noobie mistakes.
---
Or just reduce the effectiveness of bloodied while doing an over all reduction in damage. Unless we just want to keep one shotting everything.
---
Ive got a protective brotherhood officer suit it gives +2 strength :)
---
Oh, I'm on PC.
---
The numbers they released from Fasnacht said there were 8,646,507 masks collected during Fasnacht. Fasnacht was like 14 days. so 617,407 masks per day. 4 days of that is 2,470,431. Fasnacht was limited to 1 per hour, whereas with cork you should be able to find more than 1 per hour. If each person who participated in Fasnacht collects 100 times the number of masks they collected we will be good.
---
She can dance, she can jive, having the time of her life
---
I‚Äôll try and donate what I can, but resources are scarce as it is.  Not gonna be much... lol
---
Sooo am I evil for selling the .50 and .308 for 2 caps? All the others are 1cap tho
---
Those are pennies though compared to overall prices you pay
---
See my issue is that now my quest markers are gone so now I need to look up a walk through.  I'm sure I go to the whitespring bunker and what not, but after that I have no idea.
---
Same 1 cap each. 2 if i know they are used mainly :)
---
I sell basic fixers all the time, people buy them
---
I always sell mine for 1 a piece or dump unwanted ammo.  It just takes yo too much weight ..
---
Honestly. Those are too heavy to be worth anyone‚Äôs time.
---
In this timeline especially, the enclave would not be advertising itself. The whole idea of an enclave themed camp is weird as hell. Who are you advertising yourself to? The enclave at this point is more secret society than anything else in operation. MODUS (the only point of contact with the enclave in Appalachia) doesn't even explain the symbology of the enclave to the player.   
---
The outfits from 3/4 would be as out of place as the BoS paints from 4. They don't match the current lore and it was already a mistake to include them.
---
Follow around low level players.
---
I drop them every time I get any from event rewards. They're garbage in 76.
---
Funny story.  I probably spent 25 on just the left arm also.  The left arm is the devil!
---
This. Paladin Taggerdy was a badass but she was suspicious of outsiders. The hoarding of technology mandate exacerbated the problem. Did not help that the other factions refused to work together and pool resources to fight the scorched either. This was stated by the overseer in her fort defiance holotape.
---
The brotherhood's might, the free states' ingenuity, and the responders morality and network combined could have really stood a chance against the scorched plague and modus' machinations.
---
OT: #3 all the way.
---
People are mad and I love it
---
Well this is good to know. So how much does fuel and ultracite ammo go nowadays??? üòä I was thinking bout selling some eventually and making a post. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
Hi, BETA player here. A month is like a day when it comes to fixing things that are still semi-functional in this game.
---
Shouldn't XD
---
i do 1-2 depends on  what ammo type
---
I think I have about 2k fuel for sale on PC. Not 100% sure if I still have them tho. I have them for 1 cap
---
All good I hope you find lots of cheap .50.
---
Will
---
Test it out tomorrow
---
Ngl i kinda want an assaultron but thatd be op
---
Man I would LOOOOOVE this
---
I really wished my .50cal had more modding options as there's only 2......
---
If you buy the plans that require gold. Like the gauss weapons. The secret service armor, or the strangler heart, and all other armors that you get with buying gold. In order for you to be able to craft them at the weapon or armor workbench. You need to have legendary modules. Which you buy from the mole miner vendor. I forget her name. 
---
Those weapons and armors can‚Äôt be traded or bought. So you have to build them yourself. 
---
So for example let‚Äôs say you bought and learned the plan for the gauss shotgun.  There‚Äôs a chance that If you try to buy a legendary weapon from the mole miner. She might give you a random star legendary gauss shotgun. Or any other random weapon. 
---
However if all you care about is the shotgun. And don‚Äôt want to risk getting another type of weapon. You can buy the modules yourself. And craft that weapon yourself.  I believe it automatically gives you the max level for the weapon, assuming you‚Äôre above level 50. 
---
However when you craft it, it could give you a gauss shotgun that‚Äôs either a 1 star or 3 star. And it will have random legendary effects. Meaning you don‚Äôt chose what legendary it is.
---
What is auto stimulation lol. Sounds like another term for masturbating.
---
Ahhh I know there's a lot of fake couriers but some groups are legit like the big trade group here on reddit
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I agree with everything you say about both factions. The reason I find enclave interesting is we still don‚Äôt know much about them. There is much to discover.
---
Agreed my boys asked me why some glitch or problem was happening and I just told them 76 will 76. They have started to use that for other things in real life.. Driver cuts us of.. well dad 76 will 76.. lol
---
Wish I could sell my extra ammo for .25 caps that way someone could actually use it and it would just end up in the gloor
---
Same here.  Don't really understand people's incessant need to try and get absolute top cap for every single item.  Caps 
---
All mod plans 10c, and item plans 25c.  All ammo 1c.  1* Bloodied weapons 200c - if it doesn't move in a couple days it goes down to 100c, etc.
---
See that girl, watch that scene, dig in the dancing queen
---
I....I use them...
---
It should be 1cap anyway, 50 cal isn't exactly harder to make. It only needs a little more lead. Only see the point in fusion and plasma cores being more than 1 cap
---
"When are we going to be allowed to sell this crap no one wants?"
---
Hard hitting question.
---
Hang on a sec, just gonna hop into a private server real quick... ;)
---
Half of literally everything I have in my vending machines is free, some stuff is 1 cap though
---
Definitely like the way it sounds for survival, the blinding barrel would make people flip balls in pvp though lol.
---
If this were the case I would totally love to have a viable medic/group assist character that mains syringers. The concept would open a lot of creative doors for the game.
---
...why though
---
At lower levels you're best off crafting a set of excavator for that sweet 100 carry bounse. But other than that it's just farming pa spawn points
---
With the ammo converter, I sell only cores now. Before, ammo would sell for one cap each. Better to convert low selling ammo into ones I can use or expensive to craft. Better when Bethesda updates the converter for simpler operation.
---
Personally, i really wouldn't bother. You'll spend your time getting this and you'll be level 50 in no time. But that's just me.
---
Otherwise. Find where there's a spawn and then simply server hop until you find the bit you want.
---
Guess it might be a stupid question but how do i craft a set of excavator?
---
The worst enemy in the game IMHO.  I get more diseases from those bastards than anything else because you cannot hide from them, even with every stealth perk card enabled, a stealth suit, and a silenced weapon.  Hit it once from 300 feet away......"DANGER".....whoosh!....up it comes from the ground beside you, stinger blazing.  I only attack them from a high perch now.
---
They are a mess. Rounds are 1 each and can be found anywhere.
---
I hope that‚Äôs the case, I currently have a ton of unused ammo and about 40lbs left in my stash.  Almost at the dumping point lol
---
Line in the sandüëÄ
---
Doing the quest, miner miracles will give you the plans. Then once you craft your set and finish the quest you'll get plans for the pa work bench as well
---
Of course it‚Äôs atomic shop lol. All of those stuffed animals are atomic shop.  The only ‚Äúfree‚Äù one you can get. It the sheepsquatch one you can unlock in the legendary run.
---
You really need at least one  full team who knows what they are doing to complete the event successfully.  But honestly, the event has been failing a lot less since the legendary run started.  There's always plenty of people willing to shoot enemies and defend the settlers.  So all you really need is a few people to farm ore while others play defense.
---
The best survival simulator ever imho. If you survive all the bugs, boring endgame and greedy  Beth monetization as well as their "support", you would be prepared for anything. XD On the other hand playing with friends could be real fun ( at least up to lvl 200+) regardless it is not exactly what are you looking for. It\`s worth to try AAA indie game for less than 10$ (on sale). Just don\`t expect too much.
---
Sweet, thanks for the answer :)
---
I saw this event a couple weeks ago and literally everyone and their mother would participate in it. Now when I see it I end up just sitting outside the mine waiting for people just for nobody to show up.
---
Yeah I'm also looking forward to it. It'll be good to have the whole map useful to me again haha
---
Yeah I gave it another try and enjoyed it a fair bit, as far as I could tell there was no cheating, think I'll just put it down to bad luck encountering a few (blatant) cheaters in a row, Hopefully the next few games I don't see any
---
Worst, secret armour does not give u deep pockets... duh
---
Announcement of new thingies to do by Bethesda last night :) We have to help the BoS rebuild the Atlas Observatory https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/19lD84ailufdG6cgVdqls2/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-fortifying-atlas-and-quakecon-details
---
Yeah, guess i'll just wait till i'm level 50 before i try to put together a decent set. I'll do the quests for the excavator in the meanwhile
---
The damage you gain isn't that high but it's well worth those 60%
---
I've noticed that a lot lately as I'm always looking for .308. I figured it was because of the daily challenge to buy or sell 3 things. Forces people to buy their plans/ammo that's overpriced. I jump servers until I see better offers if I need to.
---
I sell every ammo except for 5mm, 45, 556, and 308 for free, but there is a sign requesting to leave the free ammo for the new guys.
---
308 and 5mm are 1c each
---
Are you on xbone by any chance? I might be able to make you a leg
---
I appreciate it when people give away 38.  My automatic combat rifles and fixers work great with a 38 receiver!
---
LOL salty ass foodbuild
---
put a 38 receiver on a bloodied hunting rifle you have yourself a 38 caliber killing machine
---
I mean...I guess I can see that. I just thought the auto grenade launcher might be more effective in terms of splash damage?
---
well did you listen to the injured supermutant or did you murder him like some kind of psycho?
---
Iirc you get the event rewards but lose your junk. You keep the ore tho that's under misc
---
I sell all the 40mm grenades I get from Line In The Sand for 1 cap each..
---
Good to know.  I might try it out today then.  I have over 20 points to allocate right now but I also need to move points from categories.
---
Are you building 100% on rock? I'm eyeballing a nice location but there is zero dirt.
---
It sucks when you get that roll for the wrong arm.
---
&gt;(even though the event awards that and more rewards too...but too much logic)
---
Not true. I have completed the event many times now with all settlers still alive and the ore deposit at 100 percent completion.  The rewards for me were the exact same as they were when only one settler was alive and the ore deposit was only 25 percent complete.
---
Don't tell me about how there is  CHANCE for a better reward.  It's a difficult event, and better results should yield better rewards. Period.  Instead,  you are punished by this games idiotic RNG.
---
When people figure out that extra effort doesn't pay off, then they stop putting in extra effort. And that's completely understandable.  Once again, this  thread is a case of blaming players for a broken game mechanic that is Bethesda's fault.
---
Mysterious button is related to the missile silos. 
---
Injured super mutant is a random encounter. If you listen to him he talks about his friends being killed by a sheepsquatch.
---
It‚Äôs probably for the same reason that people in antique malls don‚Äôt lower their prices after the same stuff is in there for ten plus years
---
So thats why i have 30 technical documents.... ive been selling them for 1 cap at the vendor not knowing that its from that quest...
---
I attacked him at first because I thought oh random super mutant but then he didn't fight back and then shouted "white thing killed brothers". Is it a monty python killer rabbit reference?
---
I think it's great. The original ammo factory, on it's own, was too slow to be useful even on a private world. Maybe it will cut into the ammo-selling "economy" but then how much time do you want to spend farming lead, or caps etc.
---
I'm a full health Melee build. I feel your pain lol
---
Pitty I wasn't able to get it before. I really liked that bundle. Well I can use Raiders equipment with the Free States Revolutionary items. Will give an Harper's Ferry feeling. Ty for the answer!
---
Do they not test this shit before releasing? Lmao
---
I do a daily drop by vault 76. Plans, ammo, recipes....
---
That seems like the best time to shoot one with a vox interpreter.
---
Usually go back and collect a bag. Then sleep and fix my weapons. Do dailies like queen of the hunt and pumpkin house, open miners lockers, cop a squatter is fast too.
---
As Secret Service, I'm unsure which of these I should be. Guess I could help as long as it's not gold I'm giving them
---
Yea you prolly right, I just don‚Äôt have a auto grenade launcherüòÇ I got a bud that has a auto
---
Grenade launcher and literally hogged the kills so I came up with some type of competitionüòÇ
---
I haven‚Äôt even been playing that long and yes it‚Äôs getting stale.
---
Some exceptions may apply,  check your local dealer for details! lol
---
You‚Äôre asking for way too much. No way would Bethesda implement something like that. If anything, I think regardless if we reach our goal or not. They will still announce that we ‚Äúcompleted‚Äù the challenge and still give us our rewards. 
---
I‚Äôm down for the idea. It seems like a good idea on paper. But like you mentioned, what‚Äôs stopping me or anybody else from agreeing to carrying your junk and just using it or keeping it? Imagine making a fake reddit account. Just to agree and schedule meet ups with you guys. Just so once I screw you guys over. I just delete the account.  
---
I have a few friends. Including my gf that aren‚Äôt 1st members. People I‚Äôve played with since the BETA and we‚Äôve become friends on fb and IG so we‚Äôve developed and actual friendship and trust. I‚Äôm sure a few of them would like the idea (assuming they care about the BOS event at all) and would love to help out with junk farming. But now imagine yourself having a full stash box and barely being able to move because you‚Äôre waiting for your fo1st buddy to show up. Whenever that is. To take your stuff away.
---
You'll gain 60% of 20% of your guns damage. Not worth it imo
---
Nice I might have to check them outüëçüèª
---
Explosive on a heavy gun is a must have too
---
That will hide you on the map but won't stop people glitching through if they do find it.  If you're on a public team they can also see your base and in my experience most people see it as a challenge to get through.
---
Beard and long hair? If so, yes!
---
I've already sold a good dozen of each the fixer and bear arm all non ledge
---
And food
---
I dont want to spoil it for you. Next time you're at a train station though click on the posters on the wall. Especially the one regarding a brother.
---
There will always be some assholes out there in the wasteland.  Honestly should've just nuked his camp.
---
I won a match the other day the same way, but another player dropped the nuke. I'm not quite sure why they did that as they had no hazmat or power armor and never moved to the non-nuked space. The non-nuked was extremely tiny and they may not have even noticed it. So I watched the team eventually die from radition from my bush. It was wierd.
---
I've already sold a good few myself, just wasn't sure if it was morally nice or not üòÖ
---
I listened to him first time, now I just shoot on sight for the xp. I blame the Legendary Run.
---
As for buttons...beware the ones in toilets!
---
I have completed the event many times now with all settlers still alive and the ore deposit at 100 percent completion. The rewards for me were the exact same as they were when only one settler was alive and the ore deposit was only 25 percent complete.
---
Don't tell me about how there is CHANCE for a better reward. It's a difficult event, and better results should yield better rewards. Period. Instead, you are punished by this games idiotic RNG.
---
When people figure out that extra effort doesn't pay off, then they stop putting in extra effort. And that's completely understandable.
---
Aye I just meant I got those just in the past few days, so it still gives the rewards for sure :)
---
When the Slocum's Joe pack returns, get that along with the Red Rocket pack. 
---
Also the red and white chairs from the base game work well. 
---
On the real though all of my tile diner is atom shop üòÖ they dont give you many options in the base game
---
They price the ammo that high to not sell it, but to show on the maps that they have thousands of rounds. After a certain point in game the caps become meaningless. After you purchase every plan from every vendor and bought every serum recipe. The next thing you can spend it on is 6000 a week for gold and to fast travel.
---
I finally decided to start buying every plan. I‚Äôm doing the remaining power armor mods and finishing up serums. After that I might buy weapons from player vendors or taking vending offline.
---
Yeah, I'd rather get some caps out of my extra ammo but I'm either gonna sell it or just drop it on the floor. I hoard ammo because I just pick up everything and it takes up inventory space after a while.
---
Who's really the bum wipe. The person who bought it having no idea it'd put you over max caps or the person who knew they were at 23k but still had a valuable item that if sold would put them over?
---
.308?  That's actually useful, should've changed it to .38 or 10mm.
---
Depends on the gun. You only gain 12% with rank 5 unless it's an actual explosive weapon like a grenade launcher.
---
How old are you?  12?
---
I have a bloodied flamer waiting for the day thier ammo consumption/durability gets adjusted.  lol like that will happen.
---
Yet, the Enclave outfits we already have, namely the Uniform and under armor, certainly makes sure to show their emblem quite prominently, so while I do agree that realistically they would avoid revealing themselves, in practice in the game they are not shy about it.
---
I don‚Äôt see the problem with the FO3 outfits, specially the scientist outfit (hazmat suit variant) and Autumn‚Äôs uniform (variant of a US overcoat, namely like the one used by general Chase in Operation Anchorage). The field uniform do might be the one item designed specifically for a certain environment, but doesn‚Äôt seem to involve anything that wouldn‚Äôt be available to MODUS.
---
As for CAMP items, that‚Äôs a very mixed bag. For instance, what‚Äôs the logic of having Corvega (a car maker) themed generators, water purifiers &amp; even turrets? Same could be said about Responder themed power armor, which from the in-game lore they never managed to actually obtain (despite being interested in obtaining Excavator PA). And let‚Äôs not forget some of the weirder ATX inclusions, such as the Liberty Prime PA.
---
Case in point, Bethesda doesn‚Äôt always stick to logic and lore for adding faction themed items to the game, which mind you, do is a problem on its own, but sets the expectations of what maybe added in the future.
---
ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è People buy em, think camp aesthetics help a little too
---
Cork's used in heatshields for space-craft.
---
Respectfully disagree.   I sell ammo at 1 cap/each and constantly see people come to my machines and purchase 1 piece at a time just to complete the challenge. It happens a lot so I don't think people are over paying for things just to finish it.
---
Well you lose 30 carry weight with the armour plated mod. So that would make sense
---
Ummm it was in a portable toilet
---
I just told him i made like 3000 caps in the last day (no one bought a fusion core) so i didnt have an issue
---
Did this myself. Used to have a welcome center near 76 untill watelanders booted my camp. Can also put santa's legs coming out of the rad road's mouth if you fiddle with it üòÜ
---
I used to aggressively farm tech data when I was trying to get the elder pain.  I had about a dozen of them. I was selling them for 100 caps and they flew off the  shelves like crazy.   Then it hit me that this was a popular outfit and a little uncommon (but not super rare). So now I sell them for 500 caps.   And people are willing to pay that price.
---
I just drop mine, I don't have time or the stash capacity to hold on to them.
---
Mods were never designed for small backpacks, until recently they couldnt be modded at all :-)
---
How about a free Nukashine?
---
Ah, I didn't know that. Thanks for the info.
---
I have a little stockpile of it but I need that for my things
---
Put another floor down and use the taller brick doorways on it. You can then delete the extra floor and have wallpaper on the outside.
---
Aww ok.  Yah then maybe not, it‚Äôs just an explosive fixer.  Trying to find ways of beefing up its damage besides the usual rifleman/commando / tank killer perk cards
---
I just put everything for 1 cap. .44? 1 cap. .50 CAL? I don‚Äôt need them, 1 cap. Any ammo types I‚Äôll never need for my build (railway spikes, fusion cells, plasma cells, harpoons, cannon balls) I usually just go to a random players camp and drop them off. It‚Äôs tiring seeing people try to sell .357‚Äôs, .44‚Äôs and shotgun shells for more than a cap per bullet, especially when they‚Äôre selling 100+ and are almost level 400.
---
People will buy for scrip
---
I don't mind it because you lose all of your hard earned ammo in one scorchbeast event.
---
Ah ok will this work on a second floor ?
---
Please tell me it's to Safety Dance
---
Nope only the torso has deep pockets.
---
Just won my first match too, a level 173 carried our team and got so many kills
---
you on pc? Ive got a 3\* anti armor auto grenade launcher and a TS M79 3\*... that should provide "adequate" competition
---
Honestly. I think you unlock the jumpsuit no matter what. Isn‚Äôt that like the first reward? 
---
Avoid fighting if you aren‚Äôt good at fighting. Hide in a bush. Or simply survive for as long as you can. This game rewards you more for surviving than for killing other players. And yes. Whatever you unlock in nuclear winter is meant to be used in regular story mode.
---
Missile silo exit
---
I second that! The devil!
---
After a certain point nothing really matters.
---
I have fallout first, but all my steel goes straight into making ammo almost as soon as I get it.
---
It seems like you do anything on this game that isn't the current meta and everyone complains.
---
Yeah granted it is materials but i believe it can be done. Any one who was around during the last community event has seen what we are capable of.
---
Oh dang! Yes I‚Äôm pc!  I appreciate it thanks!
---
Yeah, same deal. Second floor is a little easier, because the walls will snap to the first floor walls. The only issue you'll come across is the slants cant be snapped to have interior and exterior wallpaper
---
After I think about 80 rolls I finally got a 1* Uny SS Chest. Better than nothing I suppose, but was hoping for better. It'll do for now, time to move onto the other bits I guess.
---
Only way to do it outside of those perks is sneak damage modifiers and consumables.
---
Ah ok
---
I agree with you but I have a theory.  I think after the last round of duping everyone believes that all players are using supped up Handmades and that 5.56 ammo is way more in demand, ergo double the price.
---
Do you want me to offer caps for them? If so how much?
---
I can‚Äôt craft you some PA. Just let me know. I‚Äôm on XB1.
---
Got about the same. On my Junkie Character. 
---
So, worthless to me.
---
I'm not sure if you understood what I said. I meant that people with disposable income will buy whatever item they want regardless of when it's there. If they bring back the raider stuff in September and you buy it then, that's not really any different to them than if it was available right now and you bought it right now. But having it leave the store and have a ticking countdown until it's gone pressures more people into buying it that would not be guaranteed to get it if it was always around. It's a proven system used throughout the industry, it wouldn't be so widespread if it didn't work
---
You know that's based on a real live species of frog, right
---
I sell everything cheap so I can just get it out. No one buys anything from me though. All my plans are 30-50, all my bullets are 1. Just buy my stuff so I don‚Äôt feel bad about dropping it off somewhere random. I don‚Äôt even really care about the money
---
Does your camp de spawn permanently if you do this? I always want to but was afraid of losing my camp.
---
Check both headwear and helmets
---
Fish in a barrel, how true. I can confirm this is still working, did it an hour ago.  Also, reload glitch also still works.
---
Unfortunately i'm on ps4 :/
---
I have
---
Lack of stuff to spend it on, add cap sinks and theyll gain value.
---
The  Endangerol Syringe Barrel mod is actually really good against heavily armored targets such as the SBQ. It reduces the target's damage resistance by 25% for 2 minutes.
---
Edit: apparently it does nothing!?
---
I'm a junkie as well. I have 4 UNY now. Comes in handy when I want to buy PA plans.
---
But thanks!
---
I sell the fusion cores at their charge level example 92% charged = 92 caps etc
---
No. DLC(expansions) would be free. 
---
Try again..
---
This game is hardly a survival game. It‚Äôs fun and I like it but please do not listen to anyone saying it‚Äôs a good survival game
---
Im on ps4 unfortunately, but thanks for the offer :)
---
I recommend you never look up the real frogs that do this. That's creepy.
---
It's bugged and hasn't worked for quite some time.
---
Im not on first so don't have lotsa junk, but this gives me a reason to go out and hoard like I like, when I've done my 1-2 hrs playtime cause limit bs. Sounds high, but I wouldn't be suprised if were halfways end of day 1
---
There's a real frog that does it.
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Surinam_toad#/media/File%3ASurinam_toad_(DFdB).jpg
---
This guy. I thought 15k was far too much though üòÇ
---
I don‚Äôt know why upper level players with 30,000+ caps still charge as much as they possibly can and ridicule you for asking for a price you think is reasonable. What do they possibly have to gain through ripping off low level players
---
Meanwhile camps float 30ft in the air off a staircase, they really need to losen building restrictions.
---
SBQ and encrypted
---
I really want one in a giant vault. It would be so different to any other map.  
---
Also I think voting should be taken away and its just random selection. Otherwise its mogan Town 24/7.
---
You can trick into the wall with a cooking station on a floor mat. Once inside you can use the structure of the rocks to place a foundation and then expand outwards off of that. There's actually a pretty neat narrow cave formation inside you can use for a hidden part of your base if you screw around with chairs and such, it's a fun build location. It requires a lot of fucking around though.
---
Please explain what that is
---
Well you see, unlike .38 or 10mm, .308 has some value and if the guy doesn't have a build/use for the .308, they will have to have an extra think on if they should drop it or try and sell it onto someone (not everyone buys ammo so it takes up weight)
---
I'm kind of a CAMPbuilding junkie, my wife finds it hilarious that I'll actually get frustrated sometimes because I have the next inspiration hit before I've finished the last idea.
---
Jack Skellington, circa 2103
---
I like this
---
yes, true story
---
I haven‚Äôt been playing for 3-4 months.
---
I have ran into a bunch when spawning at the gallery place in the bog. I always found the robot that has a note about gold but never can find anything about it anywhere else
---
Events scorched beats queen (scorched earth) and encrypted is the event with the fake sheepsquatch
---
Edit beast*
---
I like that you like it have an upvote on me
---
You may want to look into a railway rifle, they are very low in vats cost and do very high damage.  Rifleman kinda gets punished in vats.  Look for weapons with the 25 % lower vats cost effect and use honey/corn soup/lemonade/hard lemonade for AP help. 
---
Another technique would be to max the commando cards and use an auto rifle for the queen, it will take you nine levels to get all the cards but it‚Äôs the only thing you will really have to switch to fight the queen.
---
Only 4 hours? I spend like 12-14 to build it every time but i kinda enjoy doing this. And i don't get this message a lot because My neigbours are sb, behemoth, robots and other random creatures. Poor bekket hates me I guess.
---
Same. One of the few purchases I‚Äôve been immediately dissatisfied with.
---
Honestly people clear me out with just a few dozen of each type
---
I did these before but there so difficult at low lvl, I‚Äôm looking for something fun to do, not die every 5 secs
---
Bethesda actually encourages min maxing lol I seen they written it on one of their content updates. I have to find it again.
---
Good to know, thanks!
---
Why doesn‚Äôt anyone 250+ have a vendor open?
---
The Vendor system is sort of declining now.
---
&gt;Only thing of note was the game crashed while trying to load the game when I went to play, that was it.
---
It has happened to loads of us this exact same thing this week - not on at reset/don't play NW/ &amp; it bugged out while loading &amp; like you.
---
Many of us like you had it for the first time.
---
I lost 4500 SCORE because it was on the last day of double SCORE
---
Usually run rank 1, its 20% for 1 point.
---
That‚Äôs understandable have you done all quests? I‚Äôve heard something new coming out next week I think
---
Collect wood.
---
And you claimed it from the shop?
---
Damn, downvoted for speaking the truth!
---
TRYPOPHOBIA, I want to stick my finger in those holes.
---
No I haven‚Äôt actually
---
It is because they are the ‚Äústupid‚Äù
---
Yes It says owned
---
And cloth
---
I would do that the wastelanders quests are not bad
---
True! I blew about 1000 caps on .50 rounds earlier this week. About ten minutes later, the player I bought it from fast travelled to me and dropped a free bag with 500 more rounds. Going to pay it forward from now on with the ammo types I don't use.
---
Yeah. I do the same. It may not count as a sale, but I get so many of them, and it‚Äôs just great to help others who may need it.
---
For what quest
---
In my clan we just give each other the bullets pretty much everyone uses all the ammos together so we just keep it and around once a week give to each other
---
The right opinion is not always the popular opinion lol
---
I haven‚Äôt even played since wastelanders update, I started installing it yesterday bc I want to get back into the game
---
hell you can just have em... theyre just taking up space cause im too cheap to scrip em
---
Sure?
---
No one knows, it was part of unmarked quest released before Wastelanders
---
Wow thanks man! üòÅ
---
My game crashed loading into a public world yesterday, and then again in an event on my next public world so I went private the rest of the session and none of my Daily or weekly auto completed on me.
---
this.  a lot of entitlements here, everybody plays their own way.
---
I‚Äôm not on rn it‚Äôs actually my birthday and I‚Äôm getting ready for that! I can shoot you a text when I‚Äôm getting on! ü§üüèª
---
If I see free stuff in a vendor I take it. It‚Äôs not being greedy, you‚Äôre just leaving it in there
---
Been running around collecting beer bottles like a hobo...
---
I‚Äôll do that then
---
This is the single worst outcome, to be sure. Yeah there‚Äôs absolute trash out there in the wastes who would stoop this low, but if we made all our gameplay decisions based only on this factor we wouldn‚Äôt be playing at all. From there an appeal to the better angels of our nature - a FO1st member with a bursting scrapbox would hopefully see no long term gains in stealing junk from a fellow player.
---
sounds good. Im at work right now. gonna be about 6 hours
---
Head to Grahan HQ South East Ash Heap. Read the sign with the Power Armor and you'll begin the quest!
---
I love missiles and nukes.
---
How it is possible to store so much? I have a mule for ammo and he is out of space
---
I mean I thought it was a skin to start with and then the mods that high light don't even work. Proper clown operation they got going over there lol.ü§£ ü§°

Jumping very high while wearing "funny" mask.
---
Alright no problem sounds goodüòÅ
---
Thanks for the tip, bud!
---
Need to build big house
---
I don't think she's dancing, I think she's reciting Shakespeare.
---
What do you want from post-apocalyptic world?ü•¥ blood, violence and cruelty are indispensable attributes of such a world
---
I‚Äôd use it for a bit til I got something better.
---
It‚Äôs not per player it‚Äôs that amount total on all platforms for all of us to contribute in total .. so probably will have it done by day two if we all donate a bit
---
I think it does count as a sale...pretty sure it updated my S.C.O.R.E daily yesterday when free ammo was purchased.
---
My girlfriend is telling me.all the time that I spend more.time building than playing and her, as an extreme non gamer asked me? "What is the difference between this and the sims????"
---
It's pretty common on pc.  Nothing will really change, just dont get too attached to the matches that end this way.
---
That means you have to kill alot of enemy with pipe weapons
---
yeah, always wanted to fast travel into full camp and then seeing it was locked for level 25. I would repay the kindness of yours with nuke on your camp &lt;3
---
You wouldn't happen to have signs and letters for 20, wouldja?üò¨
---
(jk... Unless you do)
---
When i was a lad we only had 400 stash space and no vendors.
---
The issue is the trading economy has been harmed once again.  The value of ammo has plummeted because of this glitch.  IMO it isn‚Äôt a big deal but I am not an active trader
---
I've spent months trying to get a bloodied plasma caster, but all i ever get are 1 star instigating and zealots
---
I might be willing to check you out. Do you happen to have plasma cores? That's my most used ammo.
---
That... is actually really sad.
---
I collect power armor...tedious but keeps me busy, never know when Bethesda will let us display them.
---
Even if its just a regular eyebot, I wish it would have that little battle tune that ED-E played when entering combat.
---
this whole require everyone to donate scrap thing is stupid. no way the brotherhood is getting all my scrap. I stole that junk fair and square like a good Appalachian American.
---
I can see so many people getting rich off of this
---
Yep I also looking for one of those.
---
We cannot explain glitches here.  It violates sub rules
---
I kinda figured, hell I haven‚Äôt played in a while and didn‚Äôt even know this existed.
---
I've started to dabble with the regular armour (I'm a PA user) now I've got the other bits I was after sorted and my plan is to see about getting a Vanguard's set scratched together as I'm a full health build and try life outside the PA sometimes without having to move my special points around.
---
I managed to get a 3\* Star Vanguard left arm last night after 8 modules. It's not a BiS roll, but it'll do the job for what I need.
---
I literally have no use for ammo past 308, even my healing stuff like rad away, rad x,  stims etc are all under a few caps 3-5 caps a piece depending on dilution or not.  My plans rarely reach over 10-50 unless it's a ridiculously hard to come by one and those I only sell for maybe 100. I see people listing plans and meds at such high prices. Do people actually fall for the high prices?
---
I sell missiles for 5 caps. Mini nukes for 20 (I'm considering making these 15). Plasma ammo is 2. Everything else is one. Oooonly missiles and mini nukes are 5 or more. (And I guess plasma and fusion cores. Those are good being sold at their cond% value.)
---
It‚Äôs a pretty common hack software that lets you have wall hack, aim assist, infinite ammo, max fire rate, flying, and shooting through all terrain.
---
Bruuhh. How about 2 free nukashine.
---
Just not with SS pieces.
---
I mean, just because Bob doesn‚Äôt feel like converting those Missiles into Ammo Points doesn‚Äôt mean I won‚Äôt.
---
I‚Äôm on ps4 i was gunna get on in two hours
---
Yeah I feel you man
---
Guess the Santa crash transferred over more than I thought, look at that gut!
---
If a bloodied build dies just as often as a full health build then why can't full health builds have an unyielding type of armor?
---
Ah, I've only got the small one at the moment
---
I stopped selling ammo ever since they released the ammo mini game, now I just play that for ammonia points.
---
I heard the CEO was in a scandal with a Mirelurk. What about reports of a Mirelurk leaving the same hotel room the CEO was in?
---
Yea I sell fuel for 1 cap. I don't use it and it won't sell otherwise. Can't even keep it stocked at that price so that's all I can really ask for.
---
Malones gang fucks me up still sometimes I swear they hit harder than normal
---
It's not a survival game. Soon they're even removing the debuffs from not eating/drinking.
---
I got like 30k plastic in my scrapbox i never use, looks like a good time to offload it
---
The fact that if you want to,  you can enjoy the space in 1st person, or have actual people over?
---
Our division of labor in games we both play is hilarious.  I build things and tank (badly, but with gusto) while she can actually navigate the inside of a virtual structure, whereas even I built it I will find a way to get lost.
---
Finally a use for those awful ghillie skins.
---
r/wholesomefallout
---
Kinda feeling an Ash Rosato
---
What level are you?
---
OP which system?  
---
And before anyone else comments *it happens on all systems* I just want to know since its never happened to me on my Xbox S, and I think its due to the fact that after I quit I also kill the game so its not left in memory.
---
I've done this since Fallout 4 since I noticed that after multiple play session the game started getting buggier and would crash more often (especially late in the game).

My theory is that if the game is not killed after quitting it, when the new dailies load they see the cached previous daily ids and automatically flag them as completed. This would explain why the logging they added is not finding a direct repeatable way to reproduce the issue, and why I've been unable to reproduce locally using any of the patterns listed on the sub.
---
I want a herd of rad rats following me like the Pied Piper
---
What I‚Äôd actually like to see is for the vending inventory on the map screen to shown unknown plans. I‚Äôm sick of traveling to people with lots of plans just to see that I inevitably already know them all. I get discouraged hoping to find elusive premium plans
---
My girlfriend finished the witcher 3 and god she took it so slow and paying attention to everything and she was so patient and tidy, her fav are cities skylines and the witcher, fallout lore and related she can't understand
---
Yeah I did that a lot too, I had to scrap a lot tho because I running out of space in the stash box
---
It is fairly recent and from what I understand not substantially faster than the collector you get from the raiders.  The added problem is that it permanently uses budget even when removed unless you move and break down your entire camp.
---
Oh I gotcha
---
Why cant we bulk ammo and sell at a more reasonable price? 1 cap for a lot of rounds is to much. If we could sell bundles of garbo ammo for like 20 caps every 100 rounds for example, that would rock.
---
No problem bud! The Torso gives you 4x more Ore when mining! Enjoy!
---
It would be cool after broken steel Bethesda's would make rise of the responders
---
I am ok with the same vending space but more stash space would be nice.
---
Got any good unyielding Shrouded wood? Looking for a right leg and a chest specifically. Would also be interested in a bloodied Combat Knife
---
Scratch the knife, just read your lower level. I'll take any level shrouded unyielding, though
---
Yeah. Serums go quick and Legendary shit quicker if u sell it pretty cheap. I ve never bought ammo bcz i shoot like 15k 50cal rounds for My Game sessions. And i still cant believe that someone spend their caps on 5mm, 2mm, 38 etc
---
Think I have 800 or so you can have for free, I don‚Äôt play the game anymore
---
And cryptids!  I &gt;NEED&lt; an alien (Flatwoods Monster) wandering around
---
60 something.
---
I don't play the game like a lot of other people. I don't grind or anything. I take the game at my own pace and play how I want. That's why I don't have the caps to just buy them like candy lol.
---
4)  Well, I was just going to throw it on the ground anyway...
---
Collector from the raiders?
---
You may voluntarily limit yourself to that while walking to camp uphill both ways.
---
I will completely support this. I've got about 2,000 hours in and and the sheriff for the central Appalachian sheriff's department so I should be able to be trusted.
---
Feel free to add me and meet up with me in the evenings or over the weekend. I'll keep track of how much is donated and throw it in there along with what I'm going to donate.
---
Xbox = TEH RED ZMAN

If you need modding Services done on most things as long as it doesn't require flux I'll do it for free.

XB1
---
I can answer that with a mildly different answer. Almost NO ONE buys plans unless it‚Äôs for a weapon, weapon mod, or a useful camp item. The exception to that being people hunting down all the mounted plans and stuff like that
---
I got a couple of interesting answers when I asked the same question; 
---
\- Cork is used to dampen vibrations affecting delicate equipment like anntennae. 
---
\-  Cork and plywood were also used in the space program as fairings on launch vehicles and insulation, being used as lightwight Laminates and pressed/molded wood products that were lightweight and strong enough to serve as either structural materials or disposable thermal insulation.
---
Oh, are you serious? That would be awesome man!
---
Here is my GT. NeonPuncake
---
I dont think so. I hinestly dont use them cus im a loner but i heard one of them actually requires you to be near teamates, not just in the group
---
i can hook you up. got a few hundred on my drug mule. I can do you 200 for 1k caps if you want. or i can do super stimpacks for 10 a piece.
---
[Fed76](https://fed76.info/pricing/) is a good site to check if that Legendary Weapon or Armor is worth anything. People use this as an idea to how much their weapon is worth. Pricing is not gospel but can certainly let you know if you have something of value or not!
---
bare foot in the radsnow
---
Depends on what you like
---
If you become an ally with the raiders you can buy an ammo generator from them.  It is a slightly slower version of the munitions factory but you can only build one.  last I checked making .50 cal was bugged in that it took 10 hours to make 200 rounds.  I can make 1k 5mm in about an hour or so
---
Hey what‚Äôs up, any updates?  This just happened to me today.
---
I have the feeling that the new weapons were assets intended for a different game
---
I feel like this takes away the opportunity for people to see cool bases etc.
---
Looking forward to it. New content and activities are always welcome.
---
People have been hacking NW since the first NW match.
---
In my opinion they wshould make it that camo SS underarmor is a paint for the normal SS underarmor (the one you buy with gold)
---
Even when I cut the prices down extremely, plasma cores never seem to sell! I‚Äôve stopped carrying them because they just took up so much stash space. :(
---
Not all machines you spesh. Just one so that scrubs don't take you low level stuff for lols
---
Theres a mining place in the dark place at the bittom left of the map.
---
&gt; and who else still yurns for beer, donuts and small animal intestine. 
---
And One More Pils! I can't wait to start requesting people broadcast that song over mic during Meat Week.
---
I hate being cornered into helping my most hated faction. I don't think I'll bother participating, and I'll spend my time fruitlessly searching for quests that oppose them. They didn't even bother with the *illusion* of choice this time.. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Aside from buying, most Blood Eagles drop 1 or more stimpaks when you kill them I've found. Riding Shotgun is a good event to run to grab some, then just hop around to different Blood Eagle camps, and I'm sure you'll find quite a few. Ever since Wastelanders, I've found Stimpaks much more common to find.
---
Find new gear. Level my character up. Explore new areas. Help other players. Complete events. Design my CAMP.
---
Aw darn. My main gun is a Zealot Gatling Plasma! It takes a lot of plasma cores
---
Play on console, haven‚Äôt run into a hacker yet
---
" They could even do something similar to Vault 94 Raids now that 'instanced dungeons' are more optimized than they were pre-Wastelanders."
---
Why, so people can complain it was too difficult like they did with 94?  
---
The community event is what it is supposed to be, a simple "fun" little charming event to hype up their Brotherhood DLC.  
---
Would I want something different more akin to what you described?  Yeah but you and I both know that's not how they do events.  They need the event to be accessible to everyone from the most hardcore min-max Vault Raider down to the lowest common denominator of noob food build guy who refuses to play with others or spec into his weapon.  Welcome to MORPG gaming in 2020.
---
It does not count as a sale, the code looks for cap sales so they must have purchased other things at the same time and server lag made it look like the free trade counted
---
This is why I will only trade with caps for an item. Never item for item with someone you don‚Äôt know and just met in game. It has to be organized and agreed upon on the reddit market before I will trade item for item. Even then, I feel uneasy about it. But things have gone pretty smoothly that way.
---
Wow good thing I was building a good thing with the raiders then.
---
that makes sense. but dupers and people who used duped (aka cheaters) stuff need to be banned
---
Alright, I'll keep that in mind! Thanks man
---
I use a TS tesla (1* lol) but missiles and mini nukes work just the same xD
---
What idiots are down voting a fact? Lol
---
I am the same way the only items I sell higher are plasma cartridges for 2 caps mininukes and the 2 types of nuka genades for 5 caps
---
I buy decorations for my camp and if I find a low priced chem or recipe that too cause im running a junkie bloodied build at the moment
---
I agree fully with you
---
I get people buying 2mm EC at 2cap per round and it took a while but someone bought my Ultracite 2mm EC for 5caps per round (won't be restocking that though) 2mmEC is useful but very heavy so that's why it's 2caps (prior to wastelanders I treated it the same as missiles and just dropped it)
---
Everything else is 1cap.
---
Missiles/Nukes/Arrows/Bolts/.50 Ball/40mm granades are all dropped at train stations.
---
Is this on a critical?
---
That's plenty.
---
‚ÄúThe internet‚Äù
---
I've had this problem when trying to replace a previously-erected (huhhuhhuh) wall panel; found I had to remove all but one of the connected wall and floor pieces, re-set the wall in question, then replace the pieces I removed. Was a real PITA.
---
You could do it all with your .50 Cal alone and still have ammo to spare.
---
I did. All it was was go do a chore for each person that will help in the raid. Which was cool, it sorta gave the characters some more personality for a bit. But then you finish them and wveryone goes back to being a good ol fashion lifeless bot. I get its an online game, but there is litterally 0 effect on how the game is once you do the story missions. Yeah you get access to some more weapons and armor, great, as it should be. But do you even feel like you did anything? Nothing changes. You now have access to an elevator that takes you to spend your gold, woohoo. Oh, wait we got smiley too. Wow what a difference we made in rebuilding. I can only think of one time in this game when i was actually impressed and moved by the story, and that was basically the only time it lets you make a game altering decision. And that was the end of the Crain mission. So you do wastelanders and your left with a world unchanged by your actions and a couple a daily quests to repeat endlessly.
---
You want to stop when you hit the mission ‚Äúchoosing a side:raiders‚Äù  and then focus on doing the settlers until you hit ‚Äúchoosing a side: settlers‚Äù as the settlers questline rewards a Chinese stealth suit.  Not getting it for free from the settlers tacks about a month or so onto the gold grind.
---
Be careful of the weight...800 stimpaks is HEAVY...wonder if they will fit in ur stash box....
---
If you‚Äôre on PS4 I will gladly buy it all
---
Yep. It tends to happen in waves. I have one entire vending machine dedicated to Fasnacht. At this point, I don't think I have all the plans for sale. I may be out of some masks too...but I did keep one of each for my own collection.
---
It is named as Daily in the datafiles afaik and whoever created the challenge just filtered for all "daily" named entries without thinking. I even filed a ticked asking for replacing it with a daily of Biv's.
---
I'd guess at some point years ago, it was meant to be a repeatable quest by having you do all 3 subquests every day but then they split it up and made it an intro quest instead.
---
That's why events need to give Ammo Points once they fix the ammo converter
---
I have a lot of perk cards enabled that make chems, junk, etc weigh almost nothing so I should be fine
---
You know, that's a great idea. I just became person number 6
---
Ok cool. Try killing the game like me and see if that helps going forward. At work, but basically just quit like normal, and then exit to the guide, and then hit the xbox button and scroll down to fallout 76. Click (I think) the 3 line button and select (again at work sorry) exit game.
---
Nah, he wants a VE or BE gatlin plasma
---
You want to be handed the best stuff......grind like every one else. All of these games are built to make money devs give you a mildly entertaining experience and that‚Äôs it.
---
You could also sell lvl 5-10 BoS Recon Rifles.
---
Doing events generally help with stim packs and purified water as well. Also fighting the SBQ generally drops super stims. Medical Wing of the Whitespring Bunker should have the stimpack plan, but it takes blood packs to make them.
---
Edit: changed science wing to medical wing.
---
Most people have the ammo maker from the raiders anyway so the demand has been down for quite a while now anyway
---
Scuzzy twats,  that's how.
---
I have a few friends who are almost always maxed out on caps. 
---
They'll buy ammo at 3-5 caps a pop just to not be maxed out and its buying something they'll actually use.
---
I'm not sure honestly. I'm guessing its rare, and that's why you're asking? I'll check tonight when I'm on, and if I do, I'll honor the price this time only!
---
And probably next time because I'll forget!
---
Thats sad , i really thought the game would be better and funny with npcs and new mechanics.
---
Idk, but I have trouble staying below the cap limit. I don‚Äôt get how selling ammo for more than 1 cap each would even make sense unless you‚Äôre constantly buying serum recipes or some shit
---
Some people are also just maxed out on caps all the time and don't care about ammo above 1 cap per piece.
---
Get the gauss minigun with all the required mods, bloodied, ffr and ultracited and you won‚Äôt need anything else. Without psycho, you will be doing 110 dmg per hit.
---
I start to feel that is a musthave for every single PC player. It would be fun watch a match with 52 hackers... :)
---
If you're helping low level new players just warn them about trading with people they haven't already met. I've always been leery of using trade since in the beginning there was a way for people to somehow actually steal from you. It has to be people I know and game with often to do it. Otherwise when I pass off items to low level or newer players I drop the items in a bag for them. I personally like passing off plans to new players... I literally could supply every new player with just about any mounted plan they could want for the next 6 months I think. I also have tons of stimpaks, purified water and radaway that I drop for them when I see them. Also ammo... 
---
It's ridiculous how some people act even in a game..
---
If you go into a high level area... it‚Äôs still going to be hard. It‚Äôs not something that needs fixing IMO but they are addressing (unfortunately) later this year. 
---
Stick to low level regions if you are a low level and you‚Äôll be fine. Sounds like you tried to blow through the game and do high level content too early. Slow down and enjoy the journey.
---
I had someone do that to me. They locked their shops through a trap hallway and killed me. I abandoned the camp and the items I lost. People are cunts.
---
PC sorry bud :(
---
I'm up for helping out! Xbox, UK (if it matters), on most night's till very late! I can also help newer players find good places to farm materials! Anyone at all, feel free to DM me here for GT.
---
The problem isnt the grind itself , but spent months to get a full modded power armor. Thats insane for a non competitive full price game lol
---
Good lord yes I have my shop set up literally on top of vault 76 which means new people come so all my ammo is one cap and I have some of the beginning ammos for free and I've had a level 300(roughly) take all my free ammo :///
---
This. The school in watoga where u do the monster mash has loads of plastic. I‚Äôd bet 300 on a run
---
thanks   havent done wastelanders yet though.
---
Having this problem trying to get a junkies plasma caster. Last night I got a 1* hunters and 1* nocturnal - couldn't possibly have been any worse. Weapons are worse imo because they need 2 modules, plus when you're at scrip limit and you have weapons weighing 20 sitting in your stash waiting to get your measly 5 scrip out of them. Infuriating.
---
 That's a good idea!
---
I have a similar approace, ammo 1, full cores 50 and dropping from there depending %, legendaries 500 max but mostly around 100-200, camp plans 50, recipes 50, armor/ weapon 100, i've been starting encryptids just to drop my caps a bit.
---
I crafted a Level 1 wooden baseball bat and changed the color on it five times, done.
---
As much as I would appreciate more stash space, my stash slows to a crawl whenever I start to dig through it, and my vendors crap out if I try to assign something directly from the stash. First BSG needs to optimize so that everything loads smoother. Implement a key ring, give scrapbox to all, allowing selling plans to vendors. Once the ammo converter is working properly that will help (I started getting rid of my unwanted ammo, but it was taking way too long).
---
I had the same problem but someone told me in world I could put the pieces on a power armor frame and store them like that since it Only counts the frame and not individual pieces.
---
I am person #1 
---
I am not giving all my materials back to Bethesda. Don't need new stuff that bad! It took way too long to collect and Bethesda has taken so much from me already!
---
It would just be a game of who can rocket tag who first the quickest.
---
I've sold the few I put up for sale.  People definitely do buy them.
---
I sell full fusion cores well above 50 caps....
---
Players cannot run PA without them. And taking workshops to farm them is much riskier now that they are the only refuge for PvP hungry players.
---
The biggest falsehood is saying the game is empty due to bans. You will always have the same number of people on your server regardless of how many people total are online at any given time. That‚Äôs how dynamic servers work...
---
How did my comment get downvoted lol
---
Replying again, because I agree on weapons. Legendaries are either good enough I keep them or post for trade. Otherwise they are usually just scrip.  But if I get something thats just OK, but has reduced weight, I might put that for sale.
---
Yeah I have like 8 power frames and like 5 I can‚Äôt even use lol
---
I hit max rep and dont even bother with the daily there anymore. I am that sick of Ward
---
The scrap banking idea is a good one! If you ever start or get involved with something like that I'd be happy to help! Xbox.
---
I know, played since beta and genuinely thought it was going to be good, but the problems with fast travelling and the rest is unreal, I thought they would have had everything ironed out by now
---
God yes. That we don‚Äôt have something basic like this, after almost two years, reflects really badly on the devs. It‚Äôs not my idea of fun to sit there, tapping x for five minutes, as I smelt a large amount of lead ore.
---
I don‚Äôt like that they are going to ‚Äúfix‚Äù scaling . It kind of defeats the purpose of improving your character and stuff
---
If it's any consolation, I'm \*still\* finding Ward half embedded in his bunk bed.
---
MODUS &gt; Pretend fantasy knights and squires.

Il be on in a couple hours, that good for you?

Seems like overkill, a lot of overkill.  I'd say you are more than set to run at least ten silos.
---
Other than the .308......2500 is about 30 seconds worth of lmg fire.
---
By the looks of the transmissions, this group has lost/will loose contact with Maxon by the time they reach us
---
Yeah, *kinda* rare, and normally very expensive (9000+ w/ full Hard Bargain).
---
Aside from buying the cheapest possible items from player vending to fulfill LR requirements, I've been farming caps stashes and buying nothing, grinding my way up.
---
I'm fairly certain that Bethesda won't tell us if we hit the goal until after we hit the goal, which means it will likely just be open until the end of each block of days. From my memory, that's what they did with previous community events. There was never a ongoing tally that you could look at, they just updated us every so often (correct me if I'm remembering wrong).
---
Yep! Ill probably be on all day.
---
How do you get an armor plated mod but only still have a small backpack? You can make a standard backpack once you complete Tadpole, which is required before you can get Possum mods like armor plated.
---
I almost exclusively sell 45, 50, and 5.56 now. 
---
It's all priced at 1c. I generally am carrying 1000+ of each. 
---
I want players to buy it all at once. Drop a few thousand caps at a time.
---
i bet they are jerks in RL too.
---
Exactly. I could not agree more.
---
Collect wood
---
We took out the scorched.
---
Watch these medieval fantasy larpers come in claim they killed the SBQ.
---
Just tag plastic. Turns out it's everywhere.
---
I've seen those hallway traps too.  
---
they are doing it for 'their' entertainment, not for everyone....
---
It was just my thought I had before jumping servers. I just shrug my shoulders and move on. I sell all my ammo at 1 cap each and plans at 20. If I see someone is low level I'll buy their stuff and drop it for them. I'm glad people are not buying overpriced junk just to complete a challenge.
---
GOD BLESS AMERICA!
---
GOD BLESS THE ENCLAVE!
---
I give everything except for 5.56 away for free ü§∑
---
Why the bloodied build perks?  They are going to be a junkie so they have the option to run full health
---
Where do you get the original plan for these. I have only seen the upright ones.
---
that made my eyes bleed reading it.
---
I read that post title wrong
---
Probably!
---
People buy .308‚Äôs for 2 caps all the time
---
Gotta get that observatory ready, gotta watch them Zetans
---
I‚Äôve also seen a lot of upselling recently. How are you gonna put a plan in your vending machine that‚Äôs worth 200 for 250? Why not drop the price a bit instead?
---
I have plans at like 10-50, but even a lot of those don‚Äôt actually sell so I don‚Äôt see how some people keep so many and try to charge more than they‚Äôre worth.
---
Spam X is life.
---
Its for the pawn shop owner she sent stuff around to people incase she went missing just prior to the bombs (evidence map fragments ect) to what we now know is vault 97 you can find her shallow grave near the entrance and the secret service note on a terminal that she was terminated for finding the vault an then the bombs dropped
---
I want a player running a heavy build or a fixer to walk into my camp and clean me out of a few thousand rounds at a time. 
---
I find players will gladly drop a few thousand for a few thousand rounds, but those heavy builds? If I'm selling 6k rounds for 12k caps? They'll likely buy less, or none and look elsewhere.
---
That would be nice (especially since everyone is grinding levels daily for SCORE), although making the content inclusive aside, I'd rather get something new rather than having to wait even longer for something that was supposed to come out a while ago (ie, legendary perks). We are getting the new wendigo colossus event; I feel if they tried to do both, we'd get neither.
---
Try Conan exiles. Fallout 76 is not a survival game. It's an rpg. When you die you only lose your building material or "junk". In any other survival game you lose everything when you die

Could someone who enjoys pvp and has friends that do just use a private server and set their own rules?  Pacifist off and kill kill kill
---
There are real frogs that look like that. They are carrying their eggs on their backs until they hatch.
---
Every ammo type is worth 1 cap in my opinion, can‚Äôt imagine selling them for more lol
---
Yeah. But some builds that burn through bulk ammo, dont want to spend time farming mats and crafting ammo. 
---
Many of these players don't have much use for caps.... So they buy what they use. Ammo.
---
Could the helmet be crafted elsewhere? I'm not there yet, but I know there is a separate option to craft headwear in the armor bench.
---
But my god is that a glorious 30 seconds

This x1000 I cannot wait to explore the forest and toxic valley again. I've been wondering around the mire and bog for months.

Definitely have my own junk and a community to get more if needed since our group helps each other.. there's probably 15 or 20 of us.. I'm definitely down to help someone else who doesn't have FO1st.

I guess I will never understand why people would be dishonest and take anything that wasn't given to them for their use or that they farmed on their own.

Honestly, Unyielding is so good it's going to be hard to put anything in that rivals it and is still balanced.  +3 to every stat (other than endurance) on every single slot is ridiculous.  In a bloodied build it's improving everything all the time.  Combat ability, looting, experience, vendoring, ability checks, it does everything in a single primary affix.
---
The only way it could even be considered balanced is the theoretical trade off, and unfortunately with the way the game works and all the synergies involved there just isn't nearly as much of a downside as up, once the gear is collected.
---
It probably should be nerfed (and other things buffed, to meet in the middle) but that's a hard sell now with so many people working hard to get their builds.
---
yes, but the best junkies build will still be the one having Unyeilding, Adrenal r√©action and nerd rage, both for raw damages in boss fights and  XP farming
---
And i dont even mention AP and Stealth
---
Thats why bloodied isnt even the problem for full/low health balance. Adrenal and Unyielding are
---
I would no worries don't mind helping out. I'm on Xbox in the uk
---
I do agree with that. It felt like an accomplishment when I got to the cranberry bog and wasn't dying every time I ran into an enemy.
---
This. There's so many ammo types I'd sell at 2 for 1c. Shotgun ammo namely.
---
This game is the worst game that I have ever loved. It is so embarrassingly flawed in so many ways. I wish i could stop playing it, and go back to playing games where i would rarely (if ever) encounter a single bug. There are no "builds", instead just legendary effects haphazardly thrown in which happens to work in one or two decent ways. Power armor is a joke. And yes, after basically removing the need for PC and XB players to purchase the base game with Gamepass, they have moved to a more predatory model. New players come in and buy a few Atom Store bundles, then move on - whereas old players spend like maybe 300 Atoms a week if that. Player turnover is more profitable than player retention. Atom Store content is more profitable than fixing bugs that are nearing two years old. There is **no** quality assurance, and their content as well as most of their cosmetics appear to be added without prior testing. Multiple complaints that PTS testers are having their reports ignored. And ugh... "Legendary" perks ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è veteran players are being punished for every perk card they have ever missed out on in favour of moving a SPECIAL point because the game has no proper respec option. The people who just moved 5 points because the latest patch broke Adrenaline are now 5 levels further away from a Legendary Perk. This game is actually terrible, and I hate that I love it. It pretty much an addiction at this point to people hanging out for their next fix of false hope that this dumpster fire can be made i to something greater. It is as if they gave access to the FO4 assets to a bunch of amateurs and said "just make whatever. It only has to work well enough to implement microtransactions."
---
When I see nonsense like that I leave a paper bag with one raw fertilizer and one Molotov cocktail, sometimes I add a ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been insulted.‚Äù note too. If I can get into their building I‚Äôll leave the bag somewhere they‚Äôll know it was deliberate, like in the bed or resource extractor, otherwise I‚Äôll leave it right in front of their door.  I wish I could claim this as my own idea but I read about doing it somewhere here on Reddit.
---
As a bloodied player who consumes a shit ton of water to keep up with my diluted radaways. I welcome this.
---
Actually buddy I wasn't signed in during reset. Any other unhelpful suggestions?
---
I think people need to set up the extractors and not lock them, that way anyone going past can collect. They do max out, and it saves the owners from having to go around collecting or remembering to check before they log off.
---
5. the people who keep making lists about types of people during the events
---
I haven‚Äôt seen any numbers, but I suspect we won‚Äôt have to contribute that much per/person.  The community scorch elimination project was a lot of fun.  I recall everyone got into the spirit of that event.  I‚Äôm hoping this will be just as fun.
---
I checked both helmets and headwear.. Nerrp..
---
Yeah. It all sells in a week... 
---
But I'll sell that much in a day every day the whole week and out earn it.

I traded a raven mask to get mine

Yeah, burned over 100 modules at 3 different times on 2 characters in the last week or so.  Got 2 1 star unyielding.  A perfect 3 star torso... on my alt and 3 other unyielding 1 of which was usable.
---
Just dumped 6 auto "stimulation" on the scrip machine last night, got another 6 tonight.  Unyielding and a couple other prefixes are rare.  It's pretty annoying.
---
Anecdotally you want very very high luck, preferably over 30, to help stars.  Super duper may help get the rarer effects like unyielding.  Either way, they don't hurt but too small of a sample size to say definitively.
---
Sorry I wasn‚Äôt clear in the post; if I‚Äôm in a level 20 area and a higher level player enters the zone the enemies go to level 35 or something to match that player and I get destroyed... I‚Äôm not asking for level 40+ zones to scale down to level 20 for my sake
---
When does this event start?
---
That when shit hits the fan it slide down hill fast.  You lose half your health.  Whelp there goes half your stats.  You hit weaker, are easier to see, may even go over encumbered.  Nothing would be scarier then facing down a deathclaw, taking a smack and whelp, there goes my back since I lost 30 carry weight.
---
My biggest mistake was continuing to play this POS over Witcher 3, FFVIIR or God of War. Never again Bethesda. Deleted yesterday. Good riddance
---
Where is it for $10?
---
once, to use the bunker buster to hit the cargobot and escorts on my low firearm skill-having alt.
---
Mountain scout is for players who played when the game released, longshorman is from a rare vendor
---
Same. But it was interesting to see people buy it.
---
Zones are level capped and have been for some time. You will never see high level enemies in the forest. If you go to the savage divide though, be prepared to get wrecked
---
Everyday, without fail, around 12pm est there are multiple post of this exact issue. Do not sign in / stay logged on during reset. Wait an hour to be safe. 1 hour of no play time is worth never having that issue. (Source: Me, I have NEVER had score auto complete.)
---
Same happened to me for the first time today and I am so done. Tried to be excited about new content but they need to fix their ish before they release any other buggy content. Such trash
---
Yep, doesn't matter. My sign in was 6hrs after reset on Wednesday and still had auto complete. Complete trash indeed.
---
Thank god this was my main issue when I played previously, I think after I get home I‚Äôll give it another chance. Thanks!
---
I was not signed in during reset so thanks but not helpful
---
This is so wholesome, thank you! And same, but just because we can‚Äôt fathom why a fellow gamer would stoop that low doesn‚Äôt mean there aren‚Äôt a few such ghouls amongst us. Sadly.
---
So to play the game without bug you have to not play the game?
---
So that 135k steel I'm sitting on from doing Fish in a Barrel is finally going to pay off.
---
Granted I‚Äôm bloodied, but I know I don‚Äôt spend 500 .50 cal rounds doing a silo.  You are well prepped!
---
I don‚Äôt get these posts. And there‚Äôs been a few recently. What my or anyone else‚Äôs opinion of this game is is utterly and completely irrelevant. You own the game. If u didn‚Äôt it‚Äôs free on game pass etc. It cost you nothing to try but your time. Only you will decide if u like it or not.
---
switch game, there are many good games out there, ~~Last~~ Ghost of ~~us~~ Sushima, MBON, FF7 remake, Valorant, or... Doom "day 1 pirated" Eternal
---
So no a way to get mountain scout now then...I have looked for this rare vendor but cannot find.
---
as I said wait an hour
---
I agree
---
Yeah. When I'm about to hit my cap limit, I run around to camps buying all of the 5.56 ammo I can find for 1c. I come home with 15,000 rounds, keep 5,000 on my character and put 10,000 up for sale on my own vending machines for 2c. All other ammo is up for 1c. That way, it makes my camp look better when people scroll over it, and if they really want to pay 2c for the 5.56, I turn a profit and just have to go on another ammo run sooner.
---
Grind whatever arbitrary item/currency/points Bethesda says to. Get reward. Show off reward until everyone gets it/it gets duped/something better is released. Complain. Repeat.
---
Yesterday and last night my husband crashed at a minimum 15 times... the servers kept disconnecting. He was in private servers. I played almost as long as he did on my PS4 and only crashed once. I was in and out of private servers the entire time I was on too.. 
---
Other days we can both be on for hours and not crash once... frustrating is an understatement...
---
A.N.N.O.Y.I.N.G
---
I'm going to assume it was the Revolutionary bundle that was removed from the cycle as it has been featured twice now in the past few weeks. So here's hoping Survivalist will pop up at some point.
---
That's what it sounds like they are saying lol such crap. Fix your game Bethesda!
---
I hear that, but anything appraised over 10,000 caps I'm loathe to let go of for just caps.
---
Yes, do something else for an hour to save yourself a day-long headache
---
Sounds fun
---
Repairing armor/weapons, and the NW challenges
---
Nobody ever talks to me. And when they do, they are adolescent men. Or German.
---
I swear I can never find any middle aged dudes from UK... Ever!
---
Im not rich
---
Move along, people are saying this has happened 6 hours after reset so what's your suggestion for them?
---
Occasionally when I feel my ammo stock is running low I will set my prices high enough to discourage people from buying them so I can give myself time to restock.  This has the bonus of sometimes someone will actually buy it.
---
So the millions upon millions of rounds that people produced with the display glitch didn't already ruin ammo trading? This glitch is a drop in the bucket compared to how many rounds were duped.
---
So? It‚Äôs definitely gonna work out. Any time there‚Äôs the option to donate, a very small percentage of people always put in the overwhelming majority.
---
Which ever one people choose to make posts complaining about each day.
---
Yea but I‚Äôm running a heavy build, so the CSA doesn‚Äôt really matter much to me
---
So it's still going on then, can I ask if the last thing you played was nuclear winter before you logged off
---
Yes, you can retrieve junk from it, but not put more.
---
All my ammo goes up for a cap except for plasma I put at 5 caps. 
---
Plans, unless rare, I put up for half the price listed.
---
I had a legendary fatman and during Fasnacht I gathered up every mininuke from the suiciders and always checked on the roof when I entered The Whitespring. Then I realized the weight wasn't being reduced by the perks I had so I just dropped them once after the event. I had around 60 and someone took them and shot them all.
---
They also fully endorsed duping and let them all back with their duped weapons.
---
Sometimes I think that Fallout 76 is just like a Vault-Tec Vault; a big experiment with semi-nefarious means.
---
Hasn't stopped me playing it though...
---
Search YouTube
---
Sounds like it. Lol
---
I do because every now and then I‚Äôll have the urge to move camp and I‚Äôm a cheap ass
---
It's been in the game since BETA. Someone just spilled the beans.
---
Sorry if my post irritates you I only made this post because I wanted to get a better idea of the state of the game. I really enjoy the fallout universe and appreciate the work Bethesda does but for this game I wasn‚Äôt a big fan at launch. 
---
I could read through pages and pages of updates or ask a few specific questions on this sub with all of you who still play and care deeply for the game... if anything these posts might be annoying but are also a sign that more people are interested in the game thus expanding the player base and the longevity of the game.
---
Thanks for the post and I‚Äôll try and limit these types of questions in the future!
---
Probably last weekend when it was chew bubblegum 3 times, like one time is bad enough. Otherwise getting critical hits sucks for me as I‚Äôm mostly melee
---
Hmmm. Feels like a check list?  Level up?  Kill a legendary?  Complete an event?  What on Earth do you do when you play?
---
Banging missed that one
---
It further ruined it
---
It's a glitch using blueprints
---
No you misunderstood, I was quoting you word for word, that direct quote is saying the exact opposite. You agreed you were inclined to buy them if they get taken out, your wording was wrong or you misunderstood the meaning of "inclined"
---
All NW challenges, but mainly the one that requires you to go and find animals to kill.
---
I feel what you're saying but 5 caps per round vs 5 minute trip to Charleston fire department? I've shot 600 rounds in 15 minutes more than once. That would be 3,000 caps. That's pretty insane.
---
... 5. People who care but still need steel for crafting, repairs, camp building and that's before the deductions for what is usually not insignificant amounts of ammo. 
---
I suspect most people will want to contribute, but in the middle of the Legendary Run there are other things calling on time and resources.
---
Haha! Ya you can try the lfg group if you play on xbox or the Fallout76Faction subreddit too.  There are lots of groups you can join
---
It was not. I rarely ever play NW. Usually just to get the CAMP SCORE challenge.
---
The light works fine for me.
---
It sounds crazy, but walk forward then backwards, and hold down the exit button while going backwards. It's worked for me everytime
---
In my experience they do disappear when the loot has been completely taken.
---
Actually I‚Äôm for this idea. Make it an extension of hunter/hunted on the radio but in groups. Starts an event like monster mash and if nobody shows up to challenge then free stuff and rewards. 
---
Instead of a team to join tho you‚Äôll have to activate it at crater or foundation, whichever one you wish to work for. Then you get put into a battlefield with an objective, these objectives will come with its own event marker ‚Äúred‚Äù and anyone can join but to partake you need to activate objective just like taking a workshop. Then pvp enabled for randoms. No loss of junk while in event. Fun?
---
Running my shop. Its fun being an entrepreneur in the wasteland. I like trying to figure out what people like to spend their hard earn caps on. üò¨ 
---
Then, I‚Äôll spend my earnings shopping for Knick Knacks for my personal collection. üòä
---
I hack the terminal on the extractor to become wanted. I then smash there shit up with explosive bait. Don't hate the player. Hate the devs.
---
This is a terrible idea! Do you really think people are going to be honest, and collect scrap for the event and not just keep it for themselves? People that play this game are not to be trusted!!!
---
I mean, it feels a bit silly to complain about since all of the challenges are ridiculously easy with a couple minutes of effort but I guess the mod weapons and armor and only because it is not something I do daily.  The vast majority of other challenges I will complete just by playing the game but it's not every day I mod a weapon or armor piece.  Either way it's not a big deal as it takes like 30 seconds to do.
---
My least favorite is level up every single day
---
seriously though haha, those were my first thoughts.
---
The only ammo that I sell is what I've picked up for free so I go a 1 cap for pretty much everthing.  I just don't want it sitting around.
---
Nothing like running a store in a nuclear wasteland
---
Last silo I ran solo, I did with a troubleshooters gatling.
---
I don't think I used much more than about 300 rds.
---
didn't launch on prime, so won't address that aspect.
---
Wouldn't surprise me since they openly endorse cheating
---
Yes, the light is bugged and the helmet is more or less missing. It seems most run rewards have some form of issue.
---
6 . The person on an extended vacation during the event, who will miss most of it.
---
There were these three lvl 300 players yesterday that kept moth dancing and hitting me in the lobby, in the match I clapped the first on the dam the second while his minigun was spinning up and the third when he tried to loot my teamate's body, don't think that a lvl 84 didn't discover the wonders of vats grenades.
---
Hmm. I tried putting the nuka cola lamp out too, neither one is putting the projections out for me.. Hmm.
---
I've had it 2 times. My fix is getting online arround 5 minutes before the daily refresh and then doing all, challenges in one session. If something auto completed, you should az least get the points.
---
I seem to recall 1200 was a thing.
---
I would much rather have a vending capacity increase to 40 or 50 items each, instead of having a 5th machine taking up space.
---
So long as I get that jacket.
---
Maybe we‚Äôll finally get those legendary Perksecco cards
---
I've just read that now..something else I want aware of lol
---
Yeah real scummy. At the time if I knew how to blow parts of their camp away I would've.
---
Longshoreman does come from the Responder vendorbot random encounter but I've also found it on a random traveling merchant once before. She had nothing but outfits, the longshoreman and clean spacesuit among them. She was at the campsite east of Crater that you need to photograph. Also just be aware the longshoreman outfit will hide your backpack when worn.
---
Not sure why this is being downvoted but ignore the morons, it's all 100% true. Check every traveling vendor you come across. Some will also sell the bow and crossbow mods you can get from Foundation/Crater.
---
thata a good idea trojbleshooters.
---
I'm blown away people have the stash space for bullets. I just carry it all.
---
next time you find him, listen to the dialog.
---
Appears in random locations - first time I ran across on, I was just S of whitesprings.
---
I have My own weekly seasons of nuking4flux, nuking sbq, farming xp, farming legendaries, doing dailies/events, building new camp etc. Withing a team I try to help newbies to lvl up or if all r high lvls we do some events but as a verte good team. The last one I enjoy most lately. If u r bored try public teams
---
I price things not according to what they're worth to others, but what stock I have.  If I've got thousands of rounds, sure, 1 cap each.  Once I'm under a thousand, I'll put some up at 2 or 3 caps apiece, not expecting them to sell but if someone is desperate I have had one or two sales in the past.  5 caps is just madness though.
---
That's my only gripe with the content coming up.  I love new stuff to do and stuff to earn.  I just wish they had made it lore friendly.  Why would the any faction give the BOS all their hard earned scrap?  Makes no sense tbh.
---
Maybe it should have been players donating to Crater or Foundation so that those factions could attempt to curry favor with the BOS.  
---
With all that being said I am still looking forward to the new things coming soon!
---
While this sounds like futile advice you should file a feedback ticket about it.  On the off chance that they decide to compensate people you should do this.  Just be polite and describe what happened.
---
It's a shame you cannot find that bargain premium plan saving you possibly thousands and thousands of caps. RIP those 14 caps you paid.
---
I'm all melee. Maybe you've figured this out but I approach this by equipping a low level bowie knife and NOT sneak attacking large monsters or hordes of things. I VATS until the crit. meter fills and immediately use it. Repeat until AP drains and sneak away until refilled. Usually I can get 6-10 crits on a lvl 90 deathclaw/behemoth or upwards of 20 crits on a single run through the Whitespring.
---
why doesn't bethesda just shut the server during reset 
---
if they cant fix this BS
---
All NW challenges, don't play them and don't want to
---
A full core will always sell at 100 caps for me, guaranteed, and not even after a particularly long time either.
---
Lifes hard in the wasteland but who really needs caps when you got 30k in the pocket
---
That too yeah. Just general capacity increase however it is done
---
Level Up as a Daily. Three a week? Fine. One a day? C'mon now...
---
It's one of those Challenges that's great at certain levels and hell at others. Yes, you can start a new character and get to level 3 (I don't think 2 counts, as that's just leaving the Vault), but starting a new character every day is a pain. At least if it's 3 for a Weekly Challenge, you can stick to that character for a little bit and knock out the weekly in one go.
---
Bold statement.
---
Just play it. There are still bugs/glitches/exploits galore, but if you like it, you'll play it. If not, well, then maybe after the next major update.
---
There's more to do now, but at level 20, you're still not going to experience much of it. Go to the forest, stay in the forest. At least until you can handle mobs in higher areas.
---
I have a very nice 3* flamer. Furious, +40% bashing, 90% reduced weight. It will melt wendigo and mirelurk kings in under 5 seconds, I love it, but you‚Äôre right it does seem like no one uses them. I also love the people who sell fuel for 1cap or sometimes I find it for free. Thanks to those players I‚Äôm able to have 2000 to 3000 fuel on hand most of the time and the batteries included perk covers it too.
---
Thanks all.  i havent done a silo yet so i wasnt sure how much to bring.  i was more worried about the SBQ solo.
---
Also if you play on Xbox you can add my gt:shadyrebob. 
---
I've take a little break for the last several weeks but I plan on playing more often when the new patch comes out and some of the new events start up. Just been trying to enjoy the outdoors before the fall and winter isolation season sets in. LOL
---
No its not
---
I tend to charge 2 or so for energy ammo 3for gamma otherwise 1 a piece
---
Finders keepers. If it's not locked or unlootable im taking it. Don't leave good stuff lying on the ground.
---
my wife and I troll each other by putting up awful crap and making the other buy it. yesterday she sold me the ivory grip revolver handle plans, and I've been selling her a full set of ultracite armor plans day by day
---
For me, again it‚Äôs personal, I like you played at launch. Like you I got to level 20. Brought red dead 2 and out the disk on a shelf. I started back in Feb or late January and after a couple of days really got into it. Then wastelanders with the NPC‚Äôs and content. Love it. Up to level 260 now and 5 chars 4 over 60. But. The game is a grind for gear and weapons and the rewards are all RNG. Just like pretty much all games of the same ilk. It will continue to Evolve and in two years maybe will be a bug infested grind or maybe the best of it type. For me, and this is why I started playing again, I figured I don‚Äôt want to come to the game in 2 years. It‚Äôs amazing. It‚Äôs great. And everyone is level 2000 with amazing weapons. Pvp is back and I‚Äôm level 27. I want to be a part of the evolution of the game. I don‚Äôt play a huge amount. I dip in. And out. I‚Äôm not bothered by weapon and armour skins. I don‚Äôt care for the NW mode. The game itself is full of bugs. Some really irritating like the fast travel and trade bugs. But. And I can‚Äôt stress this enough, I love plying on it  for an hour or two. I love helping out new players. I love working in a team for encrypted and even events like tea cup. Your comment didn‚Äôt annoy me. Far from it. I just find it very strange to ask if u have the game. Play. You might love NW.....it‚Äôs fortnite:fallout edition. You might love helping or playing with someone higher level and learning stuff. Or just finding all those holo tapes with all the story‚Äôs just waiting to be found and listened to. Then again. You might hate it
---
Same I sell my excuse ammo for 1 cap each. Only one that I dont sell for a cap each are mini nukes and missiles. But, I sell those for half price each.
---
Hope they get to the bottom of it soon i rr as logging in
---
What you dont enjoy collecting wood scrap 100 separate times??
---
That one definitely takes me the longest.
---
I don‚Äôt see why people sell ammo at all. I can craft thousands at a time for myself. One of my frequent annoyances is dropping all the looted ammo I don‚Äôt need on the ground or a train station.
---
I'd like a camp icon to be greyed out (but still showing on the map) after I visit because I only have like 2 braincells and tend to see a vendor on the map and be like "ooo 17 weapons, gotta check it out", only to realize i was there two camps ago üòÖ
---
You can craft it at the armor bench... once you buy it from the atom shop üòà
---
new character and you'll be done in 15, same thing for overseer rank in nw
---
Good luck!
---
Please sell 5mm if you are on PS4.  Two shot speedy gat and vampire minigun really chews through it.
---
Honestly, ammo is 1c a round, no matter what. It‚Äôs really easy to craft large amounts of ammo with ammosmith and super duper so there‚Äôs no reason to pay any more. My ammo moves so fast at 1c. Keeps my stash weight down and it ends up being my #1 moneymaker. Saw some dumbass selling arrows for 25c each the other day, wanted to nuke his camp just for the audacity.
---
It would still be my least favorite. It‚Äôs that it‚Äôs literally every day.
---
Yah it‚Äôs hard to level up everyday with limited time.
---
Huh. I‚Äôve not seen that as a challenge and I‚Äôve not looked today so please don‚Äôt say that‚Äôs one. Although it won‚Äôt take 5 minutes to do it will make me agree with OP lol
---
It‚Äôs rare, like the Insurgent plan and Marine Combat Helmet were from the event.  Despite dupers, the plan is still rare.  I rarely ever see them for sale on PC (that‚Äôs a lot of the word rare lol)
---
Mod 5 weapons. My current weapons are already modded how I want them. Yes, I know to just find random trash weapons off enemies and mod those using minimal resources. But it's still costing me resources I would be using in other ways.
---
If I'm only gonna buy three bullets I'd probably pay the 15 caps if it's cheaper than fast traveling to another shop
---
Build X number of walls etc in your Camp.
---
If you have a large camp, lots of details, and live perilously close to the budget cap it's a PITA . And of course you have to build it from scratch, no cheating by using stored items.
---
So easy, so annoying.
---
Tbh I could pick fault with most, if not all. I just ignore then for the first hour as many will automatically complete during normal play anyway.
---
Repair armor or weapon 3 or 5 times (dont remember exactly). Sometimes all I find are 100% condition weapons and armors for hours. And my own gear have 200% conditions so it does not help that muxh.
---
Then you won‚Äôt fair well in trading forums. You don‚Äôt need top tier gear to survive. Take your time.
---
That's pretty impressive. I agree most aren't too bad but leveling up takes me at least an hour.
---
That's nothing, currently at 180 something just to get left leg, still not got it...
---
Since going Bloodied, I rarely use critical hits anymore, so that one takes more effort. Photomode also takes effort because I need to delete a picture for it to work. Events as well, but only when I'm on a server that decides to never spawn public events (although watching 4+ players all over lvl 150 complete the Mr Messenger quest was quite funny to watch).
---
But honestly, these are all first-world problems. With Buy/Sell, I leave that one for last, as I find someone will come and buy something from my CAMP first (I mostly sell plans for random low prices).
---
Why wouldn't they just turn it in?
---
The loading crash aspect seems to be the most frequent aspect of the bug.
---
Most likely a bad hard drive sector. Remove and re-install
---
You've invented a new metal gear enemy
---
I use the green dress for NW.  Blends in rather nicely.
---
That‚Äôs not entirely accurate. 
---
Anyway point is whether there are 100 people playing or 100,000 people playing, you will still only see 24 people in your server.
---
I hate posts like this. Just let people sell things for the price they want, there‚Äôs no set price for things really, except for a minimum and maximum value. If people want to sell ammo for 5 caps and you don‚Äôt want to pay that price, don‚Äôt buy it. Eventually they‚Äôll lower their prices when they aren‚Äôt selling items but it‚Äôs really not up to you to dictate the prices they sell things at. It‚Äôs like when you go into a shop to buy something, if the price is ¬£10 more than what you‚Äôll usually pay, you won‚Äôt buy it if you know you can get it cheaper elsewhere, the only time you do buy it is if you are really desperate for it.
---
It would be interesting to have a team with specific roles (tank, damage, etc) rather than just 4 people attacking them with no particular strat.
---
"I see you found our missing property." Yeah mate, I've had it on me for the last two weeks, but you never seem to take it off my hands.
---
Paint jobs are your friend.
---
Nah.
---
Crystal decanters too
---
Just don't play at all, forehead /s
---
fair point
---
The only one I do is the drop camp one.  I‚Äôll join game. Drop camp. Leave server.
---
I end up taking over a Workshop as you get a few freebie mats to use. And you can slap shit wherever you want.
---
Accessible to the food build, yes. Beatable by the food build, no.
---
There is a reason why min/max'ers min/max. There should be room for the casual players with at least a decent knowledge of game mechanics to succeed. But the farmers running in excavator, at 800 weight since launch, swapping between a BPR and a broadsider, get no sympathy from me.
---
Well, leveling up does take some time or sometimes no time depending on where I was when I logged out the day before.  But I do have 5 characters and my lowest who is 153 is much easier to level than my main who is 560.  Either way it's not an issue as I play enough every day to level at least once.
---
If you DO want it to take a few minutes and have an extra character slot, make a new character go down and do the first quest and boom 5 minutes later you got your level.  Delete and repeat the next day.
---
PC player here my man. :/ cheers tho
---
That's a good one. I do have a maxed budget. I literally can place one thing, scrap it and rebuild it.
---
.... maybe we're the theives :o
---
It‚Äôs kinda hard to be bloodied in pvp. assuming the opponent is a decent endgame player, you get one shotted by pretty much anything.
---
I had it on Tuesday, of all days. almost 9000 points vanished.
---
Least favorite S.C.O.R.E. challenge is definitely "Get one kill in Nuclear Winter". As a sub average shooter player I do not have much success in getting said kill without being offed myself or having the kill taken. Play solo and odds are you will be killed before you can do more than simply down another player.
---
The insurgents outfit is very close. Quite a few players could craft you one. I happily give them to new players and sell them in my vendor for 499, for those who want them
---
Photomode could be fixed if they gave us more space to save pictures, or did the same thing they do with the Camera - "Your gallery is full, this picture won't be saved" and still count it when you take one.
---
Sorry this happened to you too. Bethesda fix your game! They want people to pay atoms to move ahead in this S.C.O.R.E update, they should not be cheating their players.
---
That‚Äôs 100% correct. What he‚Äôs seeing, i suspect are less high level players doing the queen. Encrypted etc because of the influx of new players from the game pass etc. And by letting players they know duped. And letting them keep their stash intact. Is endorsing duping. Kinda set a precedent now. Next glitch. Go nuts. Duoe everything. 2 week ban and back with a shed load of goodies to trade. It‚Äôs ridiculous
---
Ha yeah, the BoS are going to be building up the observatory, and nukes are gonna be going off basically right on their doorstep.
---
I'm not sure if Bethesda planned for these events to coincide right next to each other, or if it's just completely coincidental map layout.
---
some people are never going to be good at team
---
I found that I can get 1/3 to 1/2 way leveling up just from doing a couple events and my normal dailies, and then add in a run or two at some high-enemy locations and I'm golden. It can take time, but I figure when you add in the Repeatable XP SCORE that you will get, the SCORE is worth the grind.
---
That being said, I feel if this continues to be the case in the next two seasons, the average level for the player base will jump so much. I remember rarely seeing characters in the 200-300s, now I can't find a map without a few lvl 500s.
---
300 plastic isnt that bad
---
Oh I completely agree.  Believe me I am craving end-game group progression content since 94 shut down and I am quite against the further "casualization" for lack of a better word of any MORPG game that I play.    
---
I'm just telling it how it is.
---
That sucks so bad I'm sorry üòî
---
Empty goo/ash piles are not yours. They are for other players that didn't loot them. I noticed this in radiation rumble and they disappeared once other players loot them fully if they ever do
---
If only they had computer displays next to them displaying the damage dealt to the poster.
---
Good advice, although not an option for me (I don't have any unlocked).
---
Had it happen to me and it was because my station was too close to the wall behind it. Maybe just scoot it out a little bit? That did the trick for me
---
Nope i would not buy them
---
Ill buy 10k if youre on xbox1
---
Or, nobody could kill the others, they are out of reach in the sky/under the ground... it would be an unlimited match, until the fire completly close.
---
This gives me and idea... Bethesda should make a tag/flag for cheaters, and accounts flagged like that only could play versus another cheater, but nobody else, never again. So its a win-win situation: cheaters are able to play against cheaters if they want and normal, healthy players wont face them ever again.
---
not sure i understand the question...
---
I ran into my first provable cheater the other day in NW. Load into the game, doing my thing, i see a guy on the kill feed just decimating my team and others.
---
I'm still a noob in NW so only level 15, I'm thinking holy shit this guy is good.
---
I keep going along in the game, and eventually I am part of the final combatants. I'm playing to win, I have insane weapons and armor I have picked up, all of a sudden boom I'm dead, 2nd place.
---
Post game feed is a guy like 1000 feet in the air walking around,  who was sniping people with perfect aim from the clouds.
---
Fuck NW.
---
Level 5 Machete &gt; Serrated Blade &gt; Regular Blade &gt; Serrated Blade &gt; etc
---
True. So you can actually test guns on the same target with out worrying it‚Äôll die.
---
all of the ones that need me to go back to NW.  i hit level 100 in there and unless there are new exclusive rewards i'm not gonna go back.
---
This looks like this was the intended use they were hoping players would do with the concrete wallpaper.
---
Got any .50?
---
Aww man. Well keep trying. There are lots of awesome players out there!
---
I run it in whatever spare INT I have at the moment, 1-3 stars depending on what I'm doing. Use at least 1 rank, I wouldn't ever use more than 2 or 3.
---
It's not the oil that makes it hard for me, it's the acid. I run heavy guns, so I need my acid to smelt lead for 5mm and .50, can't be using it to make fuel.
---
It‚Äôs a decent idea other than that. Maybe 90% health is when the debuffs begin.
---
The limitation is they would not be able to be given legendaries. I was just hearing it in a chat the other night.
---
I would say this is different, as contesting a workshop is meant to be PVP. If you engage in PVP and lose your stuff, that's on you.
---
Even testing them on the Flatwoods Brahmin, the numbers are small and don't stay up long.
---
Cant say worth it if you get banned, well that and permanent camp budget ouch
---
If you have seen other people posting about this issue why make another post? You think since it's Friday Bethsoft employees are slacking off browsing various Fallout reddits hoping to see something interesting and will come across this and drop their shit to fix it right away? They know about the issue and they are working on it, there has been countless posts on here about it already and maybe, maybe just maybe this will lead them to actually test things out before releasing them in the future. Until then the game is bugged, I don't know why people expect anything more from Bethesda when they released a game that would delete your saves (Fallout 4).
---
As in the same pool of items
---
Yup! Someone else pointed this out an hour after I posted this; I moved the station a bit further from the wall and now it‚Äôs working again! It‚Äôs still weird because it did originally work, until it didn‚Äôt.
---
I was thinking this or like a garage maybe but not my house. Unless you‚Äôre going for a warehouse vibe.
---
Saving up for what is coming up. I know I'm going to start stockpiling all of the resources that they are asking for, so that each week doesn't become a crazy grind.
---
Because I can
---
Ah you mean like shoot the poster go to the terminal and it‚Äôll tell you the damage. That‚Äôs a good idea. So you‚Äôre not trying to look for the tiny numbers that sometimes don‚Äôt even pop up.
---
Wow you're making a lot of assumptions about me there. It's like you are replying to a different post.
---
Since this is just going over your head I'll just agree to disagree and leave it at that.
---
Good luck out there.
---
100% agree
---
Need to come up with a ‚Äúsign‚Äù to not take stuff. Like a tie on the doorknob... maybe a well known note or something. If you see the IOU toilet paper note don‚Äôt touch.
---
Most NW challenges.
---
Didn't say I wanted bargain plans; happy to pay a premium. Just want to be able to see if someone is selling plans I don't know.
---
Play X minutes in NW
---
Level up in NW
---
Kill a player in NW
---
Do X critical hit
---
I know how to hide in NW, and I know how to start an alt to level up there... still...
---
I am bad in NW, so I only can kill a few player, who are away and hiding...
---
And I know how to use VATS and shotgun, but still, I hate those challenges.
---
I'm right next to the wayward too
---
Someone had their camp near drop site V9  and their ally (commender dagauure) decided she wanted a part of the ensuing queen fight.
---
So whipping out her 10mm pistol she comes running over and takes potsgots at the queen.
---
Same, pretty much. And certain prefixes are so dumb, I might just go ahead and sell to a train station vendor for whatever caps I can get. My stash space is worth more than anything branded Nocturnal could net me in a sale. I think too much faith gets put into Fed76. The higher the price, the longer it will take to find that perfect buyer. Sometime my stash doesn‚Äôt have that kind of space.
---
There were a few known locations you could go to trigger the spawn for the Traveling Responders Merchant, but you still have low odds that the outfit you want will be what they are selling. The best trick is to get on with a friend or someone you can communicate with and join servers with. Logging out to the main menu and then joining back on your friend used to reset the inventory, I do not know if it still does, but that was how I got my Longshoreman outfit.  
---
Some of these might no longer work after the Wastelander's update I do not know, but there is a chance to find them in these locations, if there is a camp in the area there is NO CHANCE he will spawn as the camp keeps the area loaded and prevents the reset of random encounters.

---
Yeah I agree that it would be op so there should be some debuffs to it. However I think it is harder to remove rads then it is to gain rads, maybe things will change with the legendary perk "what rads?" though.
---
Happy to help. Just go to your armor bench and craft a level 50 standard backpack (assuming you are 50+)
---
Its not a bug with the neon sign, you can't remove anything from the side of a foundation, you notice when you have high foundations you can walk up them like a hill? this invisible bit of geometry stops you from being able to select items you've stuck to the foundations, its a PITA. As for the lights not working, are you sure you still have power near them? Lights need a power connector or conduit radiator nearby to work. Could just be a bug and replacing them would fix them not lighting up, but not sure you can do it without replacing the foundation.
---
My rules are simple:
---
1c All the ammo
---
1c all the plans, the only exception is the fixer plan.
---
Legendary at the price of fed76.
---
Nuka card? 110 caps.
---
Water is free at my camp and if ask nicely i cook meals for everyone and provide repairs and craft services.
---
Mi casa es su casa :)
---
In Fallout 4 the same thing applies. There are more options in the menu at the bottom as well. The Wallpapers for example are under the EDIT option when you highlight a wall. I never knew this and just found it around a week ago.
---
I'm going to have to revisit my firehouse taken over by responders, taken over again by raiders, and use these cinderblocks as an interior wall. I just wish they had a conderblock wall outter set, or concrete wall outter set.
---
Forgive my ignorance here but what is coming up that would make junk more valuable
---
Hopefully we can. I‚Äôm excited for all the new plans that will come out.
---
I'm thinking more of junk that is dropped when you die, since it is easy for someone else to come and take it while you are respawning.
---
Serious offenders got permanent bans. Others got a final warning saying if they got caught again, they get a permanent ban. There will not get another 2 week ban. They will be gone.
---
A Radtoad exploding is absolutely the worst part of having bloody mess equipped. I try to always be moving in the mothman event because of it
---
Fortifying ATLAS community event:  [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/19lD84ailufdG6cgVdqls2/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-fortifying-atlas-and-quakecon-details](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/19lD84ailufdG6cgVdqls2/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-fortifying-atlas-and-quakecon-details)
---
True. I wish you could put wall paper on the out issue of the wall or just have a concrete/cinderblock wall.
---
I saw .50 cal ammo yesterday for 200 caps each. I sell fusion cores for 25 but I never sell anything for higher than that
---
Everything I get goes straight into the converter unless it‚Äôs .45 5.56 or .308.
---
As a staunch opposer of the Brotherhood... I am more than likely not going to aid and participate a group confiscates tech that I work so hard to restore. I will also as a result, be moving my C.A.M.P. as it is close to the Observatory.. (Last thing I need is Brotherhood patrols snooping around my home.)
---
FUCK NATURE
---
I use the containers at the overseers camp and the suitcase inside Morgantown train station mainly.. once in a blue moon the overseers chest in the church at Flatwoods also..
---
I‚Äôm all about new plans and mods, even if I don‚Äôt need them at the moment.
---
It's cool to have a good look at that bitch of a robot it's always chaotic in the event
---
Sorry. Have u seen the market?  It went from getting back towards normal.....duper‚Äôs get unbanned.....every other post is legacy‚Äôs wanting legacy‚Äôs wanting B2525 and having J2525. Turn it in with the serious offenders got bans. They let pretty much everyone back and from the posts on the market place a hell of a lot of serious ones
---
All have one thing in common, NW.
---
Stay away from NW if you want to do the challenges yourself and not have them completed for you.
---
SHUUTT UPPP SHUTUPSHUTuPsHSUtUpOuijjegirjgijri
---
As someone who has played from the first second of beta, I now have 0 confidence in them pulling off anything without screwing it up.
---
Some mules are low level, I saw a level 10 spend 15k caps of stuff at my camp.
---
Isnt it from being online when the challenges reset? If that's the case then log out before the reset, problem solved.
---
Lol I always play during reset it's never happened to me. Considering myself lucky
---
Vender space doesn't free up stash space yo.
---
Hey buddy ill craft for ya. Even better ill show you where i do my material run. Teach to fish you know?
---
Hey ps4 vendors if anyone has t45 plans for this fellow 76er, do the right thing. Let me buy them at 10-20 cap each. üåàüññüèïüèûü§†
---
I don‚Äôt concern myself with 3rd party markets. I don‚Äôt believe in pricing things like that and would rather just play in-game. If those people get caught again they will be gone for good.
---
I think it partially come down to some players just don't have a use for caps any more either.
---
So ammo is one of the few things they can buy and will actually use. 
---
So they just buy it, less concerned about the cost.
---
It should be considered a type of griefing
---
Like all effects some work on certain weapon types than others. TSE Fixer is amazing.
---
You're welcome. :D
---
Sorry buddy PS4
---
Baseball bat + various colours (gained by scrapping bats). Lots of the colours only cost wood
---
lol. They got caught. They got to keep all the items that Bethesda KNOW they cheated to get breaking Bethesda‚Äôs T of S. and they just let them back with a strongly worded email. They endorsed cheating. Take a look at all the ammo machines in camps. It‚Äôs rampant
---
I agree 100%. The economy is FUBAR currently.
---
or the hole left over from the zit popping.
---
7. The dupers who will dump a fraction of their infinite junk in.
---
My ammo grinder thanks you for your contribution &lt;3 lol
---
Holy heck! That would be fantastic! If you have the time today i'll be online in a few hours :)
---
Yes, will do now thanks.
---
I have a hard time selling ammo for 1 cap. Usually, I'll only do it for highly used ammo and the rest I use that awful machine for, or if lazy, I just drop ammo in front of my shop for people to grab as needed. Things like .38 and even 10mm I'll usually drop in the starting area.
---
That said, 1 cap .50 or 5mm in your shop? I'm gonna buy it all.
---
Awesome. I had my own raider themed targeting range where a player can sit in a chair to be the target, so I put a target poster behind it.
---
How many times do you get killed running around taking photos like that lol
---
I use the first aid box in Ward's office, or the doctors bag on his desk.
---
There is a principle that works in every business in the world. The square root of all employees do 50% of the work. 
---
So if there is 1million players. Then 1000 will do half the work. May not work for this. But it is a real principle in life to keep in mind. 
---
Fallout 1st players will be the backbone.  I have 40K steel stashed. Actually all the scrap mentioned in atlas I have over 10k of all of them.  
---
You only need 100 people to give 10k to reach 1million scrap.
---
I guess but, the ammo I see over priced the most is plasma cartridges and 2mm. They aren't trying to fool lower levels they are trying to take advantage of higher levels that don't want to craft it. I will never buy ammo less than 1c people charging more are idiots.
---
Sounds like a bug on your end. There are always 9 challenges now
---
Reminded of how I had recently claimed the Gorge Junkyard only for some asshat to contest it and kill me right after I defended it from the usual ‚Äúdefend‚Äù event.
---
How does the ‚Äúcontested‚Äù thing work? I assisted someone else on their ‚Äúdefend workshop‚Äù event, then right after the event I got killed by another player even though I wasn‚Äôt the current owner of that workshop!
---
Person #7: ohhh Minutemen, I cry for youuuuuuu üò≠
---
That‚Äôs cool! Was it Long? I tried to make mine long so you can practice scopes but I already had my house down so 5 blocks was the longest I could do.
---
I miss ed-e
---
Some people say it may have to do with what you first do at the main menu screen in combination with what and where you are when you log out. I'm not claiming this will work but someone detailed their log in/out ritual and it mirrored mine. I haven't lost any score yet. 
---
First, I don't log in until after noon but I think it's safe to say we have ruled that out as others have said they lost score logging in well into the afternoon or evening.
---
When I get to the main menu, I immediately go into adventure mode in a public server. I have went to the atomic shop first a few times to get my free junk each week but I've heard others say that going anywhere else other than a public server first could trigger the score bug.
---
Before I log out everyday, I ritualistically scrap all my junk, store it and any other items I don't want on me. I empty my collectron and water farm. I stay in my camp and log out. I never use private servers or NW. 
---
Now I'm not sure if this has anything to do with it but seeing someone else with the same ritual as me not get hit by the bug, there's a chance that we could be on to something. I've heard that if your loading screen is taking an extra long time to load, immediately kill the game and restart. Letting it finish it's load could trigger the bug. Again, I'm not claiming any of these things are the cause or fix to this bug but just adding info to the pool. 
---
It's sad that we have to diagnose this bug ourselves while Bethesda does or says nothing. More challenges or double score isn't going to help. I think it's safe to say that they have no clue how to fix it. If they never bring back this score style game board, to me that's proof they can't fix it and have abandoned it.
---
You don't think he's gonna get on the junky bandwagon until it gets nerfed?
---
I've done the new character trick a couple times. It's good advice. It just seems like a waste to me. I figure I might as well lvl my main. I play quite a bit but before Legendary Run I mainly did things that didn't get me much XP (exploration and avoiding fights) so this just causes me to modify my behavior a bit. It's not bad. I could always choose not to do it.
---
Sadly I've met a few.. we just steer clear and warn others..
---
It was a final warning... they said permanent ban is next. 
---
Anyway this conversation is going nowhere. Have a good one.
---
1 cap for all ammo 60 for plasma cores that‚Äôs how I roll.
---
That's one of the causes. The thing that keeps causing mine is I crash trying to load in
---
It's the only one I've personally experienced
---
those are freaking awesome!  amazing job!
---
what about a Liberator who switched sides and sings the praises of capitalism...that would be great.
---
I do. I sell high because people buy high. I sell Alien Blasters for 2K each. Don't underestimate the amount of people that don't browse Reddit all day. You play your way and I'll play mine!
---
Maybe the winner gets two minutes to loot as much as they want - plans, atoms, scrip, bullion, and it can be claimed by any of their regular characters
---
Nothing wrong with that!
---
Don‚Äôt buy from them.
---
You are absolutely right. Just tried it with my mule and no-go. Must have been lag on a separate transaction. Thanks!
---
It‚Äôs there for ps4 as well
---
Thanks my dude!
---
There are explosives for sale in vendors. I picked up a F/E 50 cal for 10k yesterday. Expensive but was last gun I needed
---
That is crazy you say that.. MGS2 was my addiction when I was very young first addiction actually
---
Thank you for the helpful info and yes it is beyond sad that we have to diagnose for ourselves with no information whatsoever from Beth.
---
I'm down to help on PC! Name there is Kolth. I'm usually on at least once a day for a few hours.
---
I have a rule where i sell all my ammo for 1 cap a piece and I'm lvl 44. But i do have my camp by a ammo factory.
---
No worries
---
I will buy if you are on PS4
---
But I didn't waste the effort...had the mule purchase 3 pieces of ammo at 1 cap and nailed that Daily for 2 players at once!
---
The white spring train station newspaper box. Before I leave a server I always dump plans and ammo in it. I hate selling plans and ammo so it all gets dropped there.
---
No we didn‚Äôt, there‚Äôs clearly multiple SBQs or after the queen dies a new one takes over
---
I don't. Its an instant leave for me lol
---
Sadly I'm in xbox. But I'm sure if you head over to the trading sub someone can make you one pretty cheap
---
I mean, clearly he knows messing with you would end up that way, weird flex but ok
---
Why so you can cram more mounted head and ultracite PA plans in there?
---
Yeah, thx. The consensus here seems to be that stealth sniper is all well and good for exploring / missions alone, but you gotta pack more consistent DPS for raid stuff...generally, anyway.
---
How many rank levels did you have to buy? 
---
I did every single challenge from day one, also I leveled up 50 times and I am only 4 boxes farther then the game itself, just starting chapter 3 today. You are the "Orange rocket" and the game is the "Turquoise ship".  You must've bought half the board in this case worth of levels. At least 6000-7000 worth of atoms. It's too expensive for what you receive in my opinion.
---
I know. Thats what I said lol
---
I'd like to visit the mule please :) IGN: LilAceAA
---
Because there are people who will buy them. 
---
That‚Äôs why.
---
I sell everything cheap except ammo (.44 .45 5.56) although my cap is 2-3 caps. People always buy them.
---
Everything else goes for 1 or gets dropped (missiles, nukes, arrows).
---
Don‚Äôt think so.
---
My go to is the cash register in the Rusty Pick.
---
They are trying to maintain player engagement. If you could get all of the end game content in a weekend you would have one happy week end and then people would be on here talking about how Bethesda should have given us more stuff, how you could get it all in a weekend and it is just so disappointing how short the new content is. Yes I will agree months is a long time to grind for the end game armors and it is very tedious, especially for those of us who could not complete a run of vault 94 and now need to catch up, but at the same time they need to develop more content, work on trying to fix bugs as best they can.  These long grinds are to buy time as best I can imagine.
---
I learned on this sub from a post about scrapping that cork is a material that has a low weight to high returns ratio when bulked and sold. So, I've just made it a habit to pick up as much cork as possible. Bulk cork + scrapper perk + grape mentats = very decent returns for the amount of passive work that goes into collecting cork.
---
This is in the game already.
---
Do line in the sand with a well placed tent, read G&amp;B 5 and bring in 4-5k steel each event.
---
Count me as option 4.
---
All camp items are damaged I believe.
---
I already have the Brotherhood fatigues. Odd that it‚Äôs a reward.
---
Not a direct equivalent.  Just something that's actually appealing enough to offer a realistic alternative to THE build.
---
that would be sick to have an ED-E Skin for an eyebot, yeah it breaks canon but so does New Vegas Armor and Liberty Prime Armor
---
That‚Äôs the direction I went as well.  I ran over 100 levels with rifles and honestly loved the play style it‚Äôs switched to commando and can‚Äôt go back.  It‚Äôs just much easier to hang with mobs and events.  Best of luck!  What system are you on?
---
All of them.. some walls seem to be there
---
I happened to find 2400 fuel in a suitcase outside of Charleston train station awhile back, I don't use flamers at all, so I set it up for sale with the rest of my fuel, over 3k worth for 1 cap a piece, been in there for weeks an no one has bought any at all.
---
all camp items except for floors, stairs, foundations and the CAMP itself are destroyed, you can choose "repair all" on your CAMP if you have enough resources
---
Replied in chat my comment has been messing up
---
If you use bloody mess with radtoads the only thing that's left is the chest and the eggs are popped :)
---
I drop nukes and missiles, nobody was buying mine even when they were free
---
They‚Äôre just trying to make some bread
---
PLEASE. They have already proved on multiple occasions that they are dicking us around with the "limits are necessary" bull shit. They raised the max from 400-800 and the game was just as laggy. They made bobby pins weightless, didnt notice any difference. They come out with the INFINITE black hole that is the scrap box. The game still lags like shit, nothing changed. So they have the means to bump it up again because stability has never been affected by our stashes. They obviously are desprate to keep that scrapboxes value as high as possible so we will probably never see another increase.
---
Simply put in my eyes, scum. I changed my gameplay style to melee build so I really have no need for a lot of bullets. Sometimes I get people buying a while stock of shotgun shells or 10mm and since it's on cap, that an easy 500 caps whenever someone decides to buy
---
Only if I don't have a pet, or I'm maxed caps. I have lost two pets this way. And with that event pool so large, it's a pain to get another pet now. Well...unless I'm helping my friend find a pet, then it happens everytime.
---
The more I hear issues the more I think this is a connectivity issue. For starters I hear about this bug mostly from players on console. Consoles, particularly Xbox over ps4, have always had connectivity issues when connected to WiFi rather than Ethernet. FO76 has always been pretty picky about packet loss and this causes disconnects with the FO76 server. Unfortunately it is not something easily fixed by Bethesda as the issue mainly lyes with the communication between the console and the WiFi outer and not the servers. My suggestion has always been to try a hard wire Ethernet connection if you have unstable gameplay or auto completing chalenges.
---
Seriously. I'm level 70 and sell them for 1 cap each. I see level 100+ selling items 2x worth their actual value.
---
 A lot lol. Also lots of stims!
---
I enjoy locking up in loading screens and crashing to desktop.
---
Random useless fact: the Jetta is VW's best selling sedan model in the U.S. market. It's best selling vehicle overall here is the Tiguan.
---
I've personally have seen auto completed challenges occur with hard wired consoles.
---
As of today I've just got another bolstering left arm lol
---
Funny you should post that , I was on an adventure server and knocked out a few challenges, then logged on a private server and I‚Äôm convinced there were different challenges there .. not 100% I might just be going senile!
---
I will happily run for ore, every time it comes up. The problem is the 5 or 6(or 10 in this case) xp farmers won't protect the npcs. 1 minute to go and all harvesters die, WTF!
---
PC
---
And you x
---
thats very reasonable, sorry for bothering you, have a nice day
---
I have an acid and lead extractor at my base, so it doesn‚Äôt matter to me
---
I sell all my ammo at 1 c. Only thing I sell higher is Ultracite ammo
---
The light has the same issue as the little spinning nuka and raider lamps. Once in a while they will spin with no projection emitted to you. This isn't necessarily the case for someone standing next to you. Stay on the server for a bit and usually it will fix itself(not always), or you can server hop and sometimes that will fix it..... Sometimes.
---
I hope that they are killable, like all the Settlers I find in the wild. I'm all for takin' what ain't mine.
---
I‚Äôm super down.    I‚Äôm on ps4 (boredomshaman), I‚Äôm gonna look for a non-FO1st person to loan some junk storage for the event.   Whatever they chip in, I‚Äôll match on top of my own contribution to the event.
---
Does this start a quest line like the excavator posters?
---
Fist fought*
---
try coffee instead of water, it help sometimes
---
Lol me too yesterday.. I have 4 200 + level characters , so thought I‚Äôd go for something different, the joy of your first camp , small adhesive farm and junk node can‚Äôt be over estimated ..
---
I‚Äôve not transferred anything to the newbie might just let her struggle for a bit
---
300% more likelihood to catch diseases lol
---
On a more serious note, another one could be like disease effects are amplified by 300%. So you‚Äôd have to play as a kind of hypochondriac
---
Overseers Camp.
---
Especially considering scrap boxes, we know it isn't a technical problem.
---
Is it still in the atomic shop as of today? If so, how much?
---
Just did the vendor dance trying to buy stuff faster than sell stuff and getting MAX a few times.
---
Still not buying your damn ammo for 2 caps.  I'd rather buy an assaultron card.
---
Starting a dart league and need to make a lot of dartboards
---
That was engaging and we'll thought out man, thanks. I now see the error of my ways
---
This is not true, I used 1 at a SBQ fight 3 days ago and watched my damage numbers almost double between the before and after. I'm not sure if Awareness is showing the change in resistances, but like I said the damage numbers definitely went up after, significantly.
---
First, you're probably going to get flak for posting this in here, as it's more of LFG post.  Second, visit the plan mule for xbox to get started identifying what you have left to learn. From there you can start making focused trade searches.
---
i dont know what's going on. i see they have a lot of extractors
---
It‚Äôs done on purpose look at destiny and destiny 2 they were supposed to be really good games....or even red dead 2...I gave up early on them because it was just a grind fest. They put out ‚Äúnew content‚Äù to appease the customers they don‚Äôt care if you like it or not period they are there to take your money.
---
The reason she didn't land is likely due to her combat script.
---
This can be seen with other enemies, if you or the target is on your survival tent, or on the fence... Her coding won't prohibit her to land as she can't reach the target from the ground

I went to a camp built on a cliffside, sometimes a telltale sign of a trap camp. So I explored cautiously, found the vendor overlooking the cliff. Only the one vendor with 25 weapons listed on broadcast. The guy had placed confetti in front of the vendor, I approached and fell a very long way down a walled shaft onto punji spikes. The camp owner was waiting to collect the junk that I DO NOT carry, and never carry due to camps just like this. 
---
Goat legs prevented my death and all was well. I fast traveled to his camp again to get back up top and hit his vendor from the side, bought two great guns. Owner gave a heart and a thumbs up and I left. I enjoy camps like this. Some are really creative and sharply engineered. 
---
I have stacked punji at my camp lining the hall to my vendors. I have both stash boxes available at the entrance, with it marked as a funhouse. If you don't want to test your luck, you can enter through the side door. It's for fun and I get a lot of compliments, no hate.
---
I‚Äôd gladly pay max caps for it
---
If you want maximum damage, yes.  If you want optimal perks and still pretty good damage, no.
---
Hey. Sure thing! I am away for two days. Can you please message me on Sunday so I don't forget :)
---
The same as any other online game. Click button, receive pellet. Pellet wrong flavor, click button again. Damn, same pellet. Keep clicking, rat. Welcome to Skinner Box: The Game.
---
That what I was thinking but it happens more often lately and is why I started to carry the deathclaw
---
I tend to do a lot of floating camps because I like the ground floor to be open, however I use the metal pillars to make sure they all look like they're well supported. 
---
I used the magic floating mansions without pillars when I first started playing but once I played for a while it started to bother me so I added lots of support.
---
It is in the game settings
---
I‚Äôm also hoping for that as well. If they carry energy weapons, we can then scrap them to learn mods. The other thing is they should have Power Armor and be challenging. Imagine a bunker filled with BoS? That better be a hard area to get through. I want it to make Silos look like a joke.
---
For her to land, you cannot stand on the bunker, fence or a tent, it bugs her landing/targeting. She needs to agro on someone who's on flat open land, she will land if every single person fighting her is on the ground and off the bunker.
---
I sell all ammo for 1 cap each and 2 caps each for Ultracite ammo as it would make using a gun too costly ammo wise
---
Those are paid for so it‚Äôs worth it to have those
---
Yeah I just hope there aren't ceiling-mounted turrets. They suckkkkk for a melee character. But yeah, honestly that would be a really fun alternative to West Tek.
---
I want to say it's completely not canon but that hasn't stopped them yet so who knows
---
Pull up your map, LB for menu, settings, and then it is either under display or game. Damage numbers you can toggle them off or on
---
I know.  I'm just saying its possible, not that they would do that.
---
My console is hardwired but I am indeed on Xbox
---
what if I told you that I think those BOS guys are bigots and I don't want em' having any resources. I might just start junk griefing particularly for this event.
---
I've heard that shooting the queen while in the air prevents her from landing.
---
A set of troubleshooters is a good way to help boost your survival.
---
unless it's just for funsies, you don't need all those various pieces.  stick to one, or two if you want to switch for the Queen.  if I use nothing but my B25 gatling then I only feel nervous if I get down around 1500 rounds for Silo+queen fight. And that's probably 150% as much as I need.
---
If this season is anything to go by most of the rewards will have nothing to do with the theme, we'll probably get Mr Fuzzy PA paint.
---
Try resetting your router. Also saw some threads about having proper port forwarding in the past.
---
Level 1 pipe pistol :)
---
For melee, yeah that has to be tough. The game is pretty good about putting in a terminal for turret control. I also have not tried Plasma or Pulse grenades on them. I wonder if the radius would actually get them inside a room.
---
Are you on ps4
---
Unfortunately, like this post demonstrates, some players are so rooted to those positions that in 26 minutes, no one can be bothered to abandon them.
---
I recommend USSS armor to help with legendary rolls.
---
sad trombone...
---
I don't have one, I just wanted to know how much they go for because I have been considering treating my rare outfits and legendary weapons.
---
I have a furious gauss minigun and god role vampires explosive +1 intelligence 50. Machine gun and I run out of bullets fast so I‚Äôm always buying ammo and level 180
---
I read a comment saying people drop stuff inside the ice chest at the Whitespring golf club, went there to check it out and it was absolutely bursting with scrap. Good stuff too like aluminum. Now I've never found anything in it a second time, guess I used up my luck.
---
More than max. Maybe double max if someone will take caps for it. With the duping that made the red asylum more obtainable the tattered May be the most sought after outfit in the game.
---
My base is large, taking up practically the whole circle.
---
Here it is before adding the poster: https://i.imgur.com/no2oOB9.png
---
I removed the hoops and the dartboard for the poster, partially to give me a bit more budget to work with.
---
Always carry a melee weapon
---
Honestly and they wonder why they can't kill the queen. Stop being scared and get on thr battlefield lol
---
ah thank you
---
I'll definitely check it out, thanks for the tip though it still boggles my mind how a connectivity issue would cause the game to think you've completed challenges. But like I said I'll definitely give resetting my router is shot and check my port forwarding
---
I sell literally everything with a 6 or a 9 excluding ammo.
---
Vendor looks quite ‚ÄúNice‚Äù if I say so myself.
---
I've restarted six times. So much great content for low level characters in the Forest, that just becomes annoyances when you return at high level. I love the main quest, and how it leads you to various areas, and has you unraveling the mysteries of the Wasteland. 
---
The other day I had a level 40 ask me to cheese him through Belly of the Beast, and I declined, because doing it the first time, not knowing what to expect, and getting my ass kicked every step of the way is still my favorite quest.
---
yeah i completely forgot i had one until i pulled it out after
---
Kill 3 legendaries. Occasionally, I‚Äôll spawn at Westek and find 3 legendary mutants l next to each other. Most of the time, I‚Äôll spend hours trying to find one.
---
Sad PS4 player noises :/
---
Because they're smooth brain dingus'
---
Claim a workshop dude
---
So what you‚Äôre saying is that it will max out the damage on the gun, but not very much?
---
I hope I can just give one piece of the material and get a randomized reward. I don‚Äôt have a scrap box. I hope I don‚Äôt have to give like everything for one of the randomized things
---
Im honestly about to put some of this ammo up for free im running out of stash space and that ammo converter is annoying to use
---
If assholes would stop camping on their tents, on fences, and on the bunker, she'd land.
---
I prefer it when she aggros on something in the Blast Zone because she lands there. Unfortunately, people are afraid to or can't be bothered to go into the Nuke Zone and continue to stand with their thumbs in their asses on top of their tents. It takes what should be ten minutes and turns it into a 20-30 minute endeavor.
---
Indeed. Depending on your level though it might be quite hard. And you need a few people at least for the end part.
---
Think 5k .50 cal is twice as much as you‚Äôll need
---
What is this plan mule and how do I visit him/her. Sounds like exactly what I need
---
yes but we can either 100% follow the lore and not get cool stuff ...or we can mess with the lore a bit and get some cool stuff ..ill take the 2nd option
---
Fuck all that noise and you gotta tax the poor to get rich my friend
---
IMO, until they can sort out the problems with them (i.e. blocking meat piles from looting, respawning headless/naked/invulnerable enemies), they ought to just disable this crap and have them spawn a meat pile like everything else.
---
No one is gonna' care if they aren't ash piles.  In fact, I'll be happier, because then I can use my laser and plasma weapons without feeling like I'm screwing over the next person who runs West Tek.
---
Damn, thanks anyways. It really seems like there are more generous players on ps4
---
Yikes. This hits home.
---
The game obviously loads things sequentially when you join a server. My guess is that you are disconnecting in the middle of some challenge timer reset.
---
I wonder if I get nothing significant because I have already learned all of the plans that are in the loot pool for that quest.
---
I actually buy any plans I don't already have if they aren't ridiculously priced... it doesnt matter what its of, I will get them...
---
Oh nice!  Been creating a junk pipe pistol with crappy mods then scrapping the lot when done.  This is so much better!  Thanks!
---
You have to tell me what gun specifically you're using and with what mods. Perks, etc for me to tell you accurately.  But Tldr, more damage, probably not much more, large perk cost, but if all you want is damage, theres a limited number of ways to increase it.
---
add me bud, you can launch a nuke on a private server with some friends and do it that way. appalachia@: bludybowlingpin
---
I've noticed that the light doesn't project anything. Fast traveling to my camp sometimes fixes this issue.
---
The weekly that requires lot of building like 5 doors, 20 lights, decorations and other stuff. I made a blueprint to get rid of it faster
---
Honestly if Mr. Fuzzy PA was like, the Giddyup Buttercup PA but with pieces of mascot costume stuck to it I‚Äôd be down lmao
---
The challenges I had autocompleted today are the same ones as you. I also had the same amount of events done 2/3
---
Thank you! I have looked in the settings before for that but havent noticed it
---
Charleston Train Station, too. I got a couple of Fastnacht plans I didn't have.
---
I've seen it filled a couple of times and then I see nothing.
---
I have seen it work, but like the other rotating lamps, it wouldn't surprise me if it's buggy.
---
The Cosmos outfits, as it stands right now, do *not* come with the helmet.  Yes, it's stupid.  I've heard that Bethesda claimed on Facebook that this is a bug, but I haven't seen them issue any broader statement about it.
---
I just double checked and it‚Äôs under display
---
This isn't a real fix or anything but it may help: don't log out at camp.
---
It's something I do all the time just because I have pets regularly and they used to die on spawn if the camp device was too close to a foundation.
---
It's less taxing on the whole load in process. It shouldn't even be necessary but hopefully it does some good.
---
Wouldn't go for caps.
---
I‚Äôve always logged in and out at camp with no issues. Also, sometimes, I‚Äôll log out anywhere on the map and I still log in at camp
---
If a visitor can choose to be try the fungi board, that is fine with me either; and your intention and the camp seem not to hurt players but for them to have fun.  But still, some people can perceive you and your camp in a different way if they die unknowingly by your fungi board.
---
That was after the game came out. When script became a thing people stop putting legendary stuff in there.
---
Why not both? I find having some weapons with different ammo types avoid issues of running out of ammo. That and switching it up keeps things interesting.
---
Guass miniguns is extremely expensive to use all the time (although powerful). Fusion cores are generally easier to come across and more efficient
---
I wonder if becoming overencumbered when you are damaged and the strength boost from this armor dissapears would be fun or not?
---
Na that's not part of the script.
---
We'd be happy to help out with launching and actually being able to have part in killing her... 
---
We are on PS4
---
I tend to see it in the neighborhood of 12,000-15,000 caps.
---
Rick Grimes would be proud!
---
Just now, I tried doing the mission blind without looking up guides, worst 2 hours of my life playing a video game. 
---
I somehow managed to get to the last part of the mission running all out of ammo, grenades, and all guns &amp; armor broken, overrun by stealth assaultrons and robobrains so I gave up and suicided to see if there‚Äôs a checkpoint to respawn but no, you respawn RIGHT AT THE FUCKING START OF THE DUNGEON so you essentially have to run to the end of the dungeon which is going to probably take 15 minutes. 
---
It‚Äôs almost as if the devs want you to do it as a group BUT DIDNT BOTHER TO FUCKING TEL YOU.
---
FUCK THIS GAME IM UNINSTALLING
---
but now at least I have massive respect for all the people who launch nukes
---
Also a event where everyone is on the same team verses waves of creatures. You start with something like mole rats and end with scorcebeasts or maybe behemoths. Anyone who survives til the end wins. You would have say 30 minutes to build up defences. Before the start and 10 minutes in between waves. What do you think?
---
This is what I do because it's the way I enjoy playing these Battle Royal games. I don't want to be Rambo I want to sneak around and trick people.
---
I think those of us with F1st and the Scrap Box will complete those missions within minutes.
---
Yea scorched earth, its not the radiation, its that damn rad roach or baby mirelurk thumping at your toes.
---
Haven't seen that one, but as a first step I'd try letting yourself die from dehydration to see if it clears up. There's a lot of weird, synergistic effects in the game that are clearly the result of bugs. Google "magic weapons" and see what's going on there.
---
I like being in the bush, seeing someone run by then I sneak in from behind for the kill. Only way I can play. I stink at PVP
---
Taste the bush, hear the bush, see the buch, **be the bush.**
---
The BS part about this is that not only you spend a crap ton of time getting the scrip and modules, you also have to spend materials to build the BS legendaries. It's a double slap in the face.
---
You still get endgame advantage thru the perks you unlock, which in-turn bumps up your damage. If you play Fallout 4, you don't unlock leveled guns. You don't see leveled enemies. Granted, you don't have dumb weight limits when you go to one of 70 settlements you've helped, but what I think OG Fallout fans like is RPG. Being able to build a diner. Build up your camp. Craft new and whacky armor for yourself. 
---
If the trusty pipe rifle you first got coming out of vault is still your sidearm, a bullet is a bullet. You've just gotten more perks to know how to use it more effectively. Why not spend our grind on more stories, meeting people and getting a legendary roll we want from level 1 than waiting until level 50 to start playing RNG in select high level areas and hoping we get lucky?
---
They do not, but they should imo. Would help make the boss fights more meaningful and worth the effort.
---
I would much prefer a slider than a craft all button that will nuke my junk and render me overweight with ammo... also I can't see this being easy to implement with perks like super duper.
---
Only if the game was crossplay üòî
---
This is why i nike the bunker and any survival tents in the area as well.  Force the players to fiight her in a nuke zone
---
not really - even around the wayward, with newbies galore, 2 caps is max for ammo, and that's Ultracite. 1 cap everything else. Any higher and it doesn't sell.
---
We all break at some point. There's only so many pointless killings and tee bags we can take. In my run to level 100 I killed 2 people. In the same match, was one of my 4 wins haha
---
Sounds like a lagging server.  When I have that issue I will usually see 3 nuke zones open. Time to hop servers.
---
HA!!!
---
No, no one is buying them. They probably don't really pay attention to their vending machines like a lot of players do. They're just there as a kind of "whatever" thing.
---
Nothing like that. Been on like 3 servers too.
---
I sell all my ammo for 1 cap and plasma/fusion cores for 50, and ultracite ammo for 2 caps only because of the flux needed. I also sell all my plans for 50 caps including rare ultracite mods.
---
Awesome.  Thanks
---
There are hackers on Xbox too...
---
Crossing this with another thread. Maybe that's what the BOS needs all that cork for; pluging up the holes.
---
It's quite easy to replicate the bug, just stay logged in and it happens quite often. If they started giving people atoms as compensation then a lot of people would make the bug happen on purpose. (I know I would rather have 150 atoms than a days worth of score)
---
Its just somthing ive heard. Just wondering if any of yall heard anything too.
---
I don't think there's a difference between the server types, but I have had different numbers of challenges on different logins. I suspect it's a server latency issue; i.e.: client pulls list of challenges on login, but truncates list after a short period to prevent infinite login loop. If you ever see a short list, just relog.
---
Yeah you know what's not-so-fun? Someone launching a nuke at your CAMP because they didn't like that you wouldn't trade them a weapon because their offer was crap.
---
Lol no. I think it was last in the shop when the legendary run started.
---
I'm starting to wonder if playing NW is where the bug gets triggered. I never play NW and haven't lost any score. The only bug I had was the very first day of challenges I got the full score points when I completed 3 out of 5 for the Kill Robots weekly challenge.
---
The only thing that comes to mind is a quick caps dump?
---
Thank you, no worries! I'll message you then, cheers
---
Guess its only me that does buy one get one free.
---
I'm going to do that soon as well. it'll be #5 for me. I love the responders, firebreathers quests.
---
&gt;the Scorchbeast Queen is eaten up by a cheater who thinks it's a good idea to kill her in less than 10 seconds
---
To be fair, a lot of the broken "magic" legendary weapons do this all well. I have a bloodied ffr LMG that will absolutely wreck an SQB in no time flat since that bug was introduced.
---
I love this idea was trying to figure out what to do white chems and recipes as well I sell chems for 30 and recipes for less think I'll drop both and my ammo
---
They are rare outfits. Usually trade only for that one
---
I love this.
---
I do that so that it shows up on the map that I have tons of ammo. Then when people come they don‚Äôt buy it because it‚Äôs so expensive but they look at the other stuff I‚Äôm actually trying to sell and sometimes buy that. So basically it‚Äôs just a way of baiting people to buy other stuff lmao
---
Rabid wookies...
---
I stopped playing too, buildings were invisible.
---
Ps4 egroegy.
---
I will have a ledger after work today. I will take donations . . . NOT! I love my vault dwellers. If you sont have ample storage let me help you!
---
Check my post history: im a good noodle
---
It's pretty cool right?
---
It's not worth as much after the massive dupe wave that happened, so you might be able to get it for caps
---
For real. They're so stingy with bonuses everywhere else. +1 to each stat when below 20% health seems like plenty.
---
So what happens if the community is unable to gather the amount of resources needed ?
---
I would even buy a Fuzzy PA, with a bowtie....
---
This can be traced back to the launch, everyone nuked whitespring, jumped on the wall by the clubhouse and then wiped out the ghouls, after the first or 2nd patch they ran away if they can‚Äôt get to you.
---
No difference with the Queen,
---
Shooting her in the air can stop the ‚Äúlanding script‚Äù if u have stagger perks on.
---
Because we're lazy and forget to change it
---
Also idiots trying to get shoot her in mid air.
---
Only shoot when she landsüëçüèª
---
I logged in private first time today as well but all the challenges were there. I then went into NW for that one then regular mode for the vendors. All mine were correct
---
I think it's just negligence. Since the ammo converter happened I quit selling ammo at all. The only stuff I actually sell anymore are serums, and the occasional rare plan or outfit. Sometimes I will throw my junk legendaries in my machine when I hit my script limit, but unless it's junkie or Bloodied I only sell that stuff 150 caps per star it has. I don't actually need to sell anything tbh. I am always in the 20,000 cap range, and rarely do I find stuff in other vender stations that I feel like I need.
---
It's why i've stopped transferring stuff i wouldn't want to lose. scrap/cheap legendaries and ammo/aid are fine.
---
For some reason this reminded me of a Skyrim encounter I had(I haven't played Skyrim in years so the details are somewhat murky) There was some Dwarven dungeon where you can acquire a temporary dwarven spider companion. Hmm now I'm wondering in the Liberators are just reskinned Skyrim spiders, energy attacks coupled with jumping/flying melee attacks.
---
Hey buddy we just met: wanna start a free banking service for the little buds w/o fo1st? Omg we could make a double camp LOOK like a bank :D
---
Cork floors are pretty great actually
---
That would be nice. Would love some for my strangler heart. Hoping that helicopter pa paint is a season reward. But with how cool it is it'll probably be atoms haha. Oh well I spent a ton of time in nw to get my hellfire and I'll rock it proudly poop shoot and all
---
literally the moment i see overpriced ammo i just leave lol it makes me not want to buy anything
---
semi functional? things a paper weight, you could spend a whole hour converting just a few hundred rounds. shits less than useless cause the conversion rates are a rip off anyway. they should just let you break bullets down for useable scrap to make more bullets like that way better fallout game new vegas did
---
Any luck on the xbox 1 version?
---
I‚Äôm still hoping they make it so I can host a game server at home for LAN play
---
I wanna be able to romance my pet eyebot.
---
I'm not down with taking peoples junk, but I definitely agree with you on the BOS. We should have a counter ops option that wouldn't ruin it for everyone else.
---
People need to check what's being shared before sharing their own. We don't need 2 Strange in Numbers running alongside 2 Inspirational cards. I hate seeing three people sharing the same card. I share Luck of the Draw so our weapons can auto repair. If your weapon has auto fire, you're gonna see it repair itself constantly.
---
wish there were random "raid boss" public events. for example have high level buffed deathclaws/mirelurk queens/grafton monsters etc. spawn somewhere in the map as a public event
---
That would be fun.
---
Or a few million doctor mask
---
The major ps4 issue with stuttering is: having far too much in your inventory. I can carry and absolute shit ton but ps4 can't handle it. Without weight reduction perk cards I weighed 1100, with them on I weighed 400 out of 500 that i can hold. My stash was full too...ugh. My fix for this was to drop all my notes and all my holotapes (except the games) and then I proceeded to look closely at everything I carry but don't use regularly. Chems, beer, food, grenades, melee weapons I don't use cause I just shoot. I transferred all of that to a mule character and now my weight without perk cards is 300 and my stash is at about 600. I'm lvl 408 on ps4. I no longer stutter just lag because this game is still so broken but I love the brokenness. It's like a bad relationship with good sex.
---
I'd give away revolver ammo for free but I'm not high level
---
I been seeing this..smh especially when I want to buy several k worth of ammo
---
Agreed!! It was suppose to be originally... I haven't heard any updated news about it since last year early.. üòî
---
"Oooof.  This mini-gun is doing a number on my back"
---
Because PvP is such a big part of this game.
---
I'm happy to help anyone I can!
---
Your concern is valid, blaming it on cheaters is not. You don't need to cheat, glitch, dupe, or use legendary weapons to rapidly kill the SBQ. FO76 has had serious bugs since beta, and it appears they will never be fixed.
---
I thought that when the game came out but it quickly became apparent that tanking doesn‚Äôt matter in any case except encryptid, which is why that‚Äôs my fav event. Tanking all 3 pylons‚Äô damage and the imposter in the face with shit like first aid, field surgeon, power armor, and 450 health makes me feel like a superhero lol. The only time my build even matters
---
Late-stage beta. If you played at launch, you *know* we dealt with apha or even pre-alpha bugs for six or more months. Bethesda has largely moved past that, and added enough content with Wastelanders that the game feels a lot more fleshed out. There are still bugs, exploits, cheats, and dupes, but few are outright game-breaking. There are some QOL changes they could stand to make, and we're looking down the barrel of new content and a major difficulty overhaul before EOY, so stay tuned.
---
Hey :)
---
Yup - it is all done. We posted last week. Maybe just look at my post history and you should be able to find it
---
Better Angels?! Do you know SomeGuy2000?
---
Borderlands did it, why not Bethesda?
---
I read this in Nigel Thornberry‚Äôs voice.
---
Happened to me yesterday. I was in power armor as well,  I was kinda shocked how much damage my 15 strength character did,  also had the unarmed +25% mutation but still I think it was two hits and the ghoul had like 80% health
---
I hope so, I for one can‚Äôt wait for a bucket head to show up üòÇ
---
I just drop ammo I don‚Äôt use can‚Äôt stand that it takes up space lol if ya ever need anything hit me up on Xbox  
---
XxSgRaY01Xx
---
Leader of the Pack by the Tyler County Fairgrounds is your friend.
---
Lol I buy those out because I have a QEFR pipe rifle I like to mess around with. I often sell free ammo for lowbies too
---
I was reading a lot of comments but wasn‚Äôt sure I would love to visit the plan mule at some point soon currently at work tho
---
I‚Äôm not on PC tho, but I‚Äôm able to log in like normal
---
ok question.  Im level 80, FO 1st member, but still very new to the FO series.  Are you saying when you start a new character you can transfer all the stash you have from your higher level character to them?
---
The group I play with use the cigarette machines. I've not checked every train station, but most seem to have one.
---
No. Purveyor only drops things you have plans for
---
Wow, you're a trooper.   Thanks for trying so many things and letting me know.   Pretty disappointing, isn't it?   I saw someone theorize once that it was because they had "Bog Town" in the challenge and "Bogtown" as the actual name (or vice versa).    If that's true, it's hard to believe they can't insert one simple space and makes me wonder if they're saving it for some future challenge/event, at which time it will be do-able.   Still very bad, tho.
---
I had nearly 60 plasma cores in my vending machine for 15 caps a pop. Nobody bought them and they were on sale for a couple weeks. 
---
I just dropped it at vault 76 for free since they were taking up quite a lot of space in my stash.
---
Hopefully a lucky game pass noob picked it up.
---
I picked up the surgeon mask as a joke and began wearing it but then I put on the artktos lab coat and a Mr fuzzy mining helmet and it actually looks good.
---
I‚Äôm like a level 160 big gunner and I can barely keep myself and ammoüôÑ
---
Lost some plans once doing the suitcase. Second account works on the same pc.
---
Dang.. is there some early alarm for this, could one  awoid being scorched? So, anyplace in Ap. can be nuked?
---
Even 2 caps is pushing it.
---
I'll spend 1 to 3 caps to fast travel to other camps for cheap ammo, it's the principle.
---
99% sure they will add an BoS bundle that has a PA skin you can apply to all PA's.
---
Got in after 15 minutes. Appears to be some strain on pc though.
---
Fair enough, but wouldn't it be courtesy to not use that broken item during a SBQ, or on any legendary for that matter if there are others there to contribute?
---
I have all my regular ammo at 1 cap/each and it still sits, can't imagine 5 cap/per going anywhere unless someone is just trying to knock out the purchase 3 things from a vendor challenge.
---
Good question. Big update this next week though. We shall seebwhat happens.
---
Yes. Please. Who knows, maybe this will fix that bug where enemies are invincible after being turned into ash/goo piles.
---
There is only one ammo type that i sell for above 1 cap, and that is fusion cells, but even then i only charge 2 caps, but the reason is because i just have a grudge against tesla users since almost anytime that i'm trying to get workshop stuff done some tesla troll would run right in and just blast me with that unavoidable lightning zapping and that would be it.
---
I mean the chance of it is super rare, I've probably done it 2 dozen times with no issues. Just random shit luck Should've invested more in luck I guess.
---
that is the issue is they never loot them, so I am unable to loot my meat piles as they are smaller than the ash piles.
---
True enough, but wouldn't it just be courtesy to not kill the SBQ in that manner? If I had a weapon, armor, perk, or all of the above that did that, I would certainly know about it, and I wouldn't use it until the queen has regenerated the last time, if at all.
---
I never did this method being I was scatter and had fallout first for months but still scared until saw YouTube video and lucky enough never had this happen
---
Sorry, I have to ask. Do they actually sell? Plasma seems like such a niche weapon type, and the rounds dont seem to be that expensive to produce. I'll admit that I'm overly thrifty, but they don't seem like they'd be cost efficient for 2.
---
huzzah! brilliant! :)
---
When I launch, set it so you have to ft to the grove. It's all open there and she lands, gets frozen quick. The other thing is a stagger card equipped and they won't stop shooting while she's in hover trying to land.
---
Well there is an alarm, but I'm so used to people always nuking one specific area of the map that it was a big surprise while I was working on my Power Armor to find my house suddenly being destroyed and myself dead. When it pulled up the map, my CAMP was directly in the middle of the Blast Zone, so it couldn't have been coincidence, considering my CAMP is also marked as a Vendor.
---
I had shitloads of ammo at 1 cap each and didn't sell any more a month, I ended up paper bagging it all this week.
---
I had to do the same with a bunch of stuff, I was constantly bumping into stash max despite careful management and got the shits with it.
---
why you so salty? cause i dont want BOS crap? we‚Äôll see what the rare plans are and if theyre even worth it, but i dont want a BOS flag.
---
I always drop my spare anmo right in front of my convertor. I hate spamming buttons for the few ammo I get back
---
Laziness. They drop it in at whatever value the game automatically assigned.
---
Shared space in ur stash at least. I feed My mules like crazy but if i don't care so much. God rolls go with friend mode only. So learn ur lesson, mate.
---
My story from last night...
---
loaded into to my favorite spot. the crate ended up giving me a gauss shotgun, surprisingly. bush-wookied my way to the top ten and a pretty tight safe zone. I'm in a bush while a huge gun battle rages not far away... when all of a sudden, another BW creeps into my bush. they don't see me. 
---
I figure, well, I'm gonna die soon regardless, might as well get me some of that sweet XP. I pull out my shotgun and shoot that poor BW right behind the ear. They never know what hit them. I went to finish them off, when the BW's teammate (who I didn't realize was also in the bush) avenged his buddy and took me out. 
---
And then revived his teammate. the lesson here: don't be a rogue BW.
---
yep. I sure wish that there was a fix for this. I have had xmas lights stuck under one of my builds for a year and a half now. I wouldn't mind getting that budget back.
---
I got both packs already
---
It took me a while to realize you could hold the down button or just input the numbers in Fallout 1 and 2 when bartering.
---
If its ammo i dont use.. I give it away? Why not?
---
But you're having issues now, so give it a shot. Just trying to help.
---
Logging out elsewhere and showing up at camp sounds like you weren't logged out properly. Happens to me if my game crashes.
---
I sell everything on a sliding scale. 1 for junk/ammo. 69 for everything under 300. 420 for everything else besides good weapons.
---
I disagree.  It's pretty easy to achieve high S.P.E.C.I.A.L numbers even in Power Armor, albeit temporarily.  So that's not an issue.  The lack of damage output options for melee at high hp is concerning though.  Ought to do more power attack damage in power armor or at high hp or something. Or some sort of increased resilience to diseases and poison.
---
Or even just penalize people for having low hp.  Like, if you are basically dead maybe your ap should regen really slowly and/or make everything coat more ap.
---
Yes it would. There are design choices and bugs that allow players to act like jerks, it only takes a few...
---
Alright. I‚Äôll give it a shot. Hopefully it‚Äôs just temporary. I love spawning at my quiet cabin in the northwest
---
I am on PC. Did not noticed...
---
I usually give away my junk for free in vending machines, guess it's time to stock up.
---
Noticed the ally dailies can give purveyor loot.
---
It's possible to have a building with inside out walls, but in the long run that doesn't really help much because you always have a gap in the corners. It is possible to make it look decent but you have to have 2 walls inside out and 2 walls right side in, basically the parallel walls match one another. It fixes the corner gap and isnt beautiful because you see the sides of one of the walls generally, but you could at least have the front and back, or sides of your building appear to be cinderblocks.
---
If that corner gap wasn't a thing we could make structures that were so much more interesting, and I can't imagine the fix would be that hard to achieve if Bethesda tried. From what I can tell the outside face of a wall is the axis of the piece, so when you turn it, the outside edge of the wall will always snap to the outside of the foundation or wall below, or both. To fix this the axis would need to be in the center of the bottom edge of the wall so it rotates evenly. If that makes sense, would be so much easier to explain with a drawing. Lll
---
I had this happen last night, was disheartening. I also had an idea along those lines; A CAMP device that lets visitors vote on the camp, like 1-5, for satisfaction. Not necessarily design only, but overall presentation. When placing camps, the system would take the highest rated camps first. This would encourage people to put some thought and creativity into the camp build.
---
Not exactly sure how that would work with already placed camps?? Maybe you get a little note that your camp was not up to standards and it goes "poof" when a better one comes along. Then prompting you to change servers if you like?
---
And yea, it could also be griefed by jerks giving you a 1 when you clearly have a 5.......I don't know, just an idea. There has to be some incentive to put some basic effort into your camp.
---
This is a fact hahah
---
You'd think that, but we still see a dozen posts a day about people one shotting legendaries. I personally use a different weapon in public games (gauss minigun) for group events; only to break out my lmg on a queen if people are struggling.
---
I think part of the issue is that, in this scenario, some people may not to think it is broken and actually designed that way. I certainly did a few months ago until I found info about how how the furious affect was stacking on high firerate weapons despite not having the tag.
---
Then of course, there are the still obvious hacked weapons floating about using parts never intended to be used together but these are less common than the proliferation of "magic" weapons.
---
The only ammo I sell for 5 caps in camera film and fusion and plasma cores for 125 each all others are 1 caps each
---
Beast action shots. Wish I could catch shots like this. Lol
---
Sounds like a neat idea. My psn is sButler754, send a request saying ‚Äújunk‚Äù if anyone needs a buddy
---
Hint:  you do not need to kill radscopions. The stingers are found pretty regularly in scorchbeast guano piles. Especially at the asylum.
---
Source? And is it as common as people signing in around 12pm est and posting about it within an hour? Just asking which of the 2 scenarios are more common. Mine, or your 6 hour example? (Its the internet so of course you won't admit it)
---
Ah forgot about the stagger triggers.
---
Other than insane grinds longer than the blacks guys dick in that porn movie, PvP is the only real endgame.
---
Probably for the same reason you see level 200+ people selling 500 mounted head plans at 500 caps each
---
My stash is always in the 700-800 range. My carry weight is always 280-300 (my Max without PA is like 390). Nothing changed
---
Personally I have a friend who has an absurd inventory like another poster mentioned. I lag anywhere near them, build mode around them slows to 20 FPS, it's bad. If this doesn't help at all maybe try sorting some stash space out.
---
I also heard that rumor.
---
I want to be able to craft bulk ammo to sell. Like the ammo converter gives you bullets in batches of like 30, 45, and 100. I would like to sell boxes of 100 .50s for like 10 caps each. That would be helpful to get rid of overstock, it'd make a more competitive market and it'd help out new comers.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôll try. But like the CAMP, this has never been an issue.
---
Yeah After watching a bunch of videos seeing this I turned mine on. Like seeing when I hit 1400 hit
---
Friends (if you have them). It makes the game 10x better
---
Sometimes, if I'm nearby since I have to stay on world anyways to exit back to main menu since hitting find a new world often puts me back into same one while main menu doesn't. 
---
I've been disappointed every time by their inferior camp. Also it's never in the same spot as mine and is usually a few dozen radiuses away.
---
Question is how much does each individual have to donate at a minimum to receive the item or bonus, let's say 1 guy donates 10,000 and another 5,000 and newish players donate 100 or so, what about the I individuals that do not donate would they still receive the rewards
---
Have started using Forward Station Delta as the fighting spot instead of Drop Site V9 (reverse nuke zone - zone goes north of Fissure Prime). A lot less stuff to stand on down there and you can generally draw folks out into the open field where she will actually land. Doesn't save you from the tent campers, but helps to minimize the non-ground standing options.
---
I'm not excited for the BOS or the rewards, but I have a scrapbox and I'm definitely going to help the community. Does that make me the 5th option?
---
It's in this thread fanboi
---
Well I use a plasma caster so it‚Äôs what I need. Though i don‚Äôt believe many people actually like that weapon
---
I sell all beginner ammo at a cap each and I typically get a lot of buyers both high-level and low.
---
I only sell 5.56, because that is the only ammo type that sells. For 1 cap each.
---
The way I see it is, every time I pick one up that‚Äôs just a cap that needs to be converted.
---
It would be silly for one to think that what they are using isn't broken. If you're shredding a legendary that is intended for a good portion of the server to tackle together, people are throwing the "?" and angry emote after, or people are voicing their distaste through their mic immediately after, that should be a solid indication that you should not be doing whatever you're doing. 
---
Ugh... idk... people need to be more mindful..
---
Gonna have to repair all from the CAMP unit if you have the materials. Otherwise it's a grind to rebuild it again.
---
At least we get a warning now when loading into a nuke zone on a new server, it used to just drop your butt in the middle of the sizzle and that was that
---
I guess that is entirely possible , I didn't think about it like that. üëç
---
Person #8: I have no idea what is going on. I'm too drunk for this shit. Just point me in a direction so that I can kill shit and get lootz.
---
We definitely need a mothman boss event in this game!! 
---
Nuking point pleasant and having the true Mothman appear would be epic as F$#@
---
CONtemporary house? Atom shop only, sorry.
---
5.56, .50, 5mm, plasma cores at 1 cap each. The rest are 0 caps normally
---
You know what bro. You're right, I'm wrong üëçimma go enjoy my non auto completed challenges
---
im trying to solo the queen so ok then
---
Will update in a bit re launching nukes in opposite area
---
Byeeeeee oh and it's you're*
---
Same - and I sell plans for at most 30 caps, most are in the 5-20 range. Easy enough to earn caps as it is.
---
I think you craft the space helmet separate from the outfit...I see it in the Atom shop separately as well.
---
I am ashamed to admit that I had to Google that name...
---
I'm more inclined to buy them if they remain there. How am I supposed to buy them if they aren't even there?
---
Yes! We need the porn mags! Where are those duppers when you need them?
---
Thank you very much!
---
Best weapon I got from Queen was nocturnal explosive assault rifle. Best from encrypted was hand guns. Best from purveyor was 3 bloodied weapons in a row including my bloodied fixer. Best from alley missions was just last night a3 star bloodied cyro. Wish Queen and imposter and also colossus dropped better stuff. I got a 3 star mutant pool cue from colossus the other night smh
---
You also have the cheating shits with the exploit of the Ammo machine From the workshop.
---
(Not the raider or legendary rub one) who use the exploit to make thousands of ammo to overcharge like turds
---
We Will never got that much. At least because scrapbox sees it as cloth. I understand u r joking but watch out the stupidest ideas can be taken seriously.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs about when I started. Okay good to know, thanks!
---
They won't do anything I tried. Sorry this happened, it's seems very common and there are conflicting opinions on why and no word from Bethesda.
---
Apologies I overlooked the solo part. Yeah so for sure like 500 5mm for a silo and then ammo for the gun you want to use on the queen....not sure how many rounds you would use for whichever one you pick as that may depend a lot on how magic you get the magic to magic.
---
Ah makes sense. I bet it'll return after the event is over.
---
This is not a new idea, gang. Community events have happened before and have succeeded. (You should have seen the scorched slaughter count.) If the group target is met or exceeded, the reward will be given to all. All any of us have to do is contribute toward the goal. Not a lot to worry about here, honestly.
---
I checked the shop, and it shows the suit varients but with the helmets on the costume.. I don't own the regular costume, so the helmet won't show up in the shop for me.
---
Not sure if it‚Äôs exactly what the community agrees with but all the bugs don‚Äôt bother me, kinda is a Bethesda game and I‚Äôm used to it at this point. Duping glitches are annoying but depending on how people perform them is where I decide if it bothers me (if someone dupes to help others then idc but if it‚Äôs specifically to troll/harass then nope)
---
Definitely will stay tuned. I‚Äôve always liked the idea of this game and have been waiting for it to be updated (thus im still subbed to r/fo76) and I feel like this is the time to give it another chance... honestly everyone on here that‚Äôs commented has helped influence my choice to come back (not that anyone cares too much) but I do appreciate the time for all the people that have responded
---
Reads in sadness when I sold mine for 15k üò≠. Was only level 60 at time and wasn't aware of outfit op sales
---
Kinda falls on you in this instance. Literally and figuratively.
---
All the other community stuff always was
---
There is no guaranteed method of avoiding it. People are just desperate to find a way that would. That why you see those "do this and that" posts. I have followed every single tip/hint/post i have ever seen and have had the bug happen to me 3 times now (once during the season).
---
You can move non-locked items between characters using the normal game mechanics. (locked items are certain Legendaries or items that have a symbol after their name - Atomic Shop, etc.)
---
- Have a buddy hold your items while you change characters and then get your items back from them again
---
- Use a world container to store items from one character, and log back on with the another character to pick them up. **MUST** be the same world, so best to use a private world, or to have a friend anchor the world so you can reliably get back to the same one with the second character
---
I haven't gotten it yet, but I have read that it projects downwards. Poor design if you ask me, but if that's true then it should have been ceiling mountable. That could explain why so many have trouble getting it to work. Try putting it up high and see if that works. I mount my nuka bottles in my x-mas tree like a topper, and they are always working, but if I put them on a self or table they sometimes don't work.
---
Iam a level 210 and I've been selling ammo always for 1:1 caps nothing higher and I like to be fair
---
Same
---
Maybe look through vending machines. I always find something I need/want
---
Awwwwwww no haha. Well I‚Äôm definitely gonna try! Thankfully I‚Äôve gotten everything else, including Xmas up to the Nuclear Winter Beanie, so just gotta grind out that last one üò© Thanks for the info!
---
No worries, just message me when youre on. GT: ImTwoJs
---
Gotcha. This is my first one so wasn‚Äôt sure. Thanks!
---
She wiƒ∫l actually land on someone on a fence or a bunker if she happens to finish her circling animation within range of her to initiate a melee attack. Having players off the fence just increases the probability that someone will be in range of her to initiate a melee attack.
---
Old man here and I feel the same way.  From the Midwest US though . IF you see me on send me a friend request. redzone04
---
I have two amazing flamers and I literally buy all the fuel I see.
---
&gt;Now, the bloatfly barrel. Bloatflies are not a threat to anything. Unless you need to farm bloatflies, there is no point to this barrel.

---
I've been playing for 2 weeks now and I'm level 90 with over 40k ammo and a full ultracite with a jetpack and i sell all plans, ammo etc for 1cap or 10cap per plan I dont get the overpricing when everything is so easy to get
---
.... he just said so they want to see who will buy ranks.
---
The king Grognak outfit still annoys me. I mean, where is the equality? 
---
If male Grognak has to wear a lioncloth for an outfit then female Grognak should only wear a lioncloth!
---
If you're not "rich" enough to afford traveling around the map you're nowhere near rich enough to afford any of the things you're after, even if you do find someone who needs caps.
---
Did you check the overseer cache at Camp McClintock?
---
Once they update the converter I think we may see fewer discard bags, to be honest.
---
Yes you can transfer the things, I have a mule character on which I am transferring all my legendaries, in the private world, for me is safer, I build the camp of my mule in wayward and I am using the stash there
---
I'm wondering which version of the program they're using to run this nonsense. Using old versions of Erectus to do this usually results in an automatic ban.
---
thanks.  yeah i have a stalkers gatt laser and medics plasma with bashing so ill bring 10 cores each
---
I'm not sure how or when the "only appears if you are online" rumor started. Because it got proven false weeks ago.
---
Love tricking, oh boy here‚Äôs a treat!
---
Love it when you find a stealth boy too but still in the bushes.
---
Standard hits. Tested it further by comparing performance between a junkies and TS laser rifle. Damage dealt was almost exactly the same, with the TS being slightly behind which I‚Äôm attributing to the second shot losing damage to DR.
---
Yup.  A bunch of people pulling guesses out their butts and speaking like it's fact.  Supposedly I should be getting hit by it every single day since the last thing I do before logging off is play Nuclear Winter and then never log back in to adventure before closing the game.  Still have never been hit by it.
---
I have also found my first mule being used more to do the odd mission etc. It's quite refreshing to start again
---
As a FO1st member I have an embarrassing amount of steel, sadly not a lot of concrete (concrete foundations  and brick and tire walls at my camp) and good numbers on cork and plastic.
---
My plan is to give my buddy all the mats he needs to complete whatever milestone there is for the quest.  Then, I'm going to give any low level I see how ever many mats are optimal. I might even put a sign up at my camp "Message me for ATLAS mats!".
---
I know when I was leveling up I wanted to focus on the main story.  Having something like this would distract me and play havoc with my objective-oriented sensibilities.  So, I'll relieve as much stress as I can.
---
I'm not saying your idea is bad at all.  it's a damn fine idea! I just don't want anyone to accuse me of stealing or fumbling a mission.  I would carry that shame IRL for a while.  I'm weird like that tho.
---
I read "cork" as something else and was like WTF!!
---
I get so pumped when i find a stealthboy, usually only to be be gunned down from behind before i use it ha.
---
I got FO1st just to avoid griefers. I really wish PVP wasn't a part of the game. Why can't we just combine our efforts when claiming a workshop instead of fighting over it. You help build up and defend the workshop, you get access to the resources it produces. I wouldn't mind helping out. I'm on ps4
---
Months ago. The bug has been around for nearly a year now. If not over a year.
---
Same problem here. Cannot figure it out.
---
Stacking tents,  well then,  now I understand.  Nice camp though man,  great idea, the location is nice and you did a great job with the showcase!
---
What... what does that even mean?
---
I sell every single ammo type for 1 cap on all my characters. The only exception is the 38 that I set for zero caps.
---
Danke. Glad you enjoyed it.
---
Damn. Good luck. It's very useful to have for a bloody
---
I'm melee only so I have a ton of ammo to sell. I sell it all at 1 cap except for fusion &amp; plasma cores which I sell for (wait for it...) 69. Arrows I'd sell for 2caps only because you have a chance to get arrows back after you use them. Nobody buys arrows. I've seen players selling ammo for 5 caps or more &amp; I make a point to message them &amp; let them know that nobody will buy it.
---
I log on about 10 minutes before everyday and mines been fine. I don‚Äôt think the logging out before it resets makes a difference.
---
you found it but never learned it?
---
Today we killed her withing 10 sec literally. I looted her as anyone else (no negative emoji was shown) and i wasnt in a team. Get a fastshooting weapon with ultracite ammo and u will get enough. Of course I agree with u that we have to share but what the reason to suffer every time and post it here? I don't understand that.
---
Too make money for 6000 cap treasury notes my guy welcome to fallout 76, you new here?
---
How often are you on? I'll visit your Walmart
---
Being level 100 isn‚Äôt anything special with all the time that has past, not to mention the double and triple xp.
---
You can play this game a lot while still being a moron.
---
Maybe when below 80% health benefits go away. When above 80% health, constantly gain rads. That way you need to constantly use radaway and stimpacks, and a few hits from gouls will bump you out of the health window for benefits
---
That's awesome! what system are you on?
---
  Hi!y$'
---
Ioo99ovvvvyvvgz!7 l tz ct.ttg nzxc 4zwlu e f wf 2 CV v v
---
I either exchange my ammo..or put it in random suitcases by railroad stations.
---
On my main character I'm shotgun only. I would not buy your ammo even if I was desperate. I will only pay 1 cap &amp; if you sold it for that, I would buy it all. I'm happy to buy 3000+ shotgun ammo but not at your prices. 1 cap each &amp; I'll put thousands in your pocket.
---
&gt;Don't hate the player. Hate the devs.
---
This is exactly why there is toxicity in this game. "if you're not cheating you're not trying" eh?
---
I sell all plans for 10 caps and all recipes for 5. **ALL**
---
Yet I never get any customers, I even made a sign using "Crane's Treasure" sign, weapon display boards, and light up letters. The sign says **CHEAP PRICES &amp; FREE PURE WATER**
---
My only guess is that I keep my camp up on the far corner of the map, up above deathclaw island.
---
The best is when people come sniffing around your bush or better yet hop in the bush with you but never realize you are there.
---
Had a group of 3 surround the damn bush this morning all with weapons and armor, one with PA and a 50cal.  PA guy walked right into me and didn't question why the bush was blocking him.  Lmao when they all left.
---
Ummm i think your missing the point of dailiy limits. Bethesda is making you subconsciously need to play the game everyday by limiting how much you can do. Apparently people spend more when they feel obligated to sign in daily as opposed to getting a bunch of stuff done and then coming back when you actually feel like playing the game.
---
Same, tonnes of left arm and right arm, have 4/5 set, just left leg being a bitch...
---
For a smart consumer in today's market I'll have to disagree. Example: I don't play stealth characters I have no need to purchase what's in the shop. Maybe down the line I have time off, create a new character based on stealth. It would be nice if I could buy some items based on stealth but at that point maybe the theme is bothers of steel. Money lost, disposable income doesnt mean infinite, one still has to consider the game's health, resources, and quality of life. I know fallout 76 won't last forever and the servers will shut down. How embarrassing to have put hundreds in for used items.
---
They put faith in a marketing systems that worked in the past, doesnt mean it's the best system in the market now. Success comes from innovation not recycled assets and systems.
---
Also I may not play a lot of games but this isn't so widespread for triple A games. At least not at the scale Fallout 76 is using it. For Honor a game 2 years older has a larger player base and more resources than fo 76 because they still have a lot for purchase in game. Yes they have limited time events with special items and bundles but 75% of there store is consitant. I have more reason to explore my options. It feels anything of worth in fo76 leaves the shop before enough consumers can even see what it is.
---
I'll try doing this the next time I am on!
---
Yeah sucks huh?  That‚Äôs why I have a mule dedicated to killing the queen,  he has a floating kill base right next to the fissure prime site that is big enough for her to land on which she does all the time.  It‚Äôs great to see the whole server up there sometimes.  Best part is because the floor is upper floors the platform can‚Äôt be destroyed,  no worrying about poisoneous creatures and stuff scuttling about either.  I‚Äôm telling you Bethesda isn‚Äôt fixing this stuff so let‚Äôs just make lemonade with our lemons,  I want to see more kill bases out there boys and girls.
---
Yes, but it‚Äôs not there
---
I wear it all the time on Xbox...looks good with all camo and camo under armor
---
Tomahawk throwing is a must
---
It would be awesome if they would just make all power armors (and current skins) into skins that can be applied to any set of PA. I love T-45, but why would I ever use it now after getting T-65.
---
Yes. Yes they do.
---
The nuclear site at bottom of map. That's also a workshop. Or go to radiation rumble location. There is about 6 or 7 on the tables
---
Out of curiosity, what is a good price for plasma cores? I tried selling them at 20c each and they did not sell so i ended up dropping them at a train station.
---
That‚Äôs usually what happens to me too, oh a stealth boy, nuke codes! 50.cal! I‚Äôm a walking army! Turns the next corner to get beaten up by a guy with a stick. 
---
Bush is ‚ù§Ô∏è never trim my laddies
---
Every bullet I sell is 1 cap always have and always will
---
It would be cool if Bethesda made a dropped loot bag that was a stick in the ground with a sign stating ‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt take‚Äù
---
Using the l15 simple handmade with skins is sex
---
Oh yea shotgun shells are 1 cap ü§£ all ammo save that super special stuff is 1 cap and that special stuff highest priced is Nukes at 5.
---
You can buy a plan from responder bots and make your own
---
First time I didn't enjoy bloody mass
---
thanks i really appreciate it! i had one but i either dropped it or scrapped it by accident.
---
Use a build planner to map your perk choices as you level. Find some 1* unyielding of any kind of armor to start and replace as you find better pieces. And even a 1* bloodied Handmade, Fixer or Combat Rifle can do a lot of damage when modded, and are pretty cheap to get ahold of.
---
This is the [Bloodied Commando / Team](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=5f345db&amp;d=sg2s01eu0eh1pi2pp2ph2pg2p01pq0la2lu2lt2l71ir2ib1a30a00a12an2ar0ao0a51a70ce0c62&amp;m=051c249fb3&amp;n=Bloodied%20Commando%20%2F%20Team) build I'm using while the Legendary Run is going on. Trying to maximize XP and join up with a Public Team every session (generally Building Team for INT boost). Using a BE Handmade and full set of Unyielding armor. Really don't die much and when I do I know it's coming because I've tried to stretch something too far. **NOTE** - Adrenaline is currently bugged, so that's 1 pt that could go to something else.
---
I tank the pylons and that ruins my stash of stims lol
---
Yup and I‚Äôve been online and watched the list depopulate then refill fine like 3 times now. Never once had any score or completion issue.
---
Go to a market sub
---
I will buy ALL your nukanades! I find very little nuka cola around but the nades are amazeballs.
---
Also, take off tank killer. The stagger stops her landing

Fuck frogs

Unlikely I'm afraid.

No it‚Äôs not just you it happens all the mother loving time I‚Äôm on Xbox
---
Then they should disappear like meat piles on my screen. I can take every item and clear out my meat piles and my teammates will still have them on their screen. The same should happen with goo and ash.
---
I am a 1 cap per round seller. I only sell the popular rounds too.
---
Also I have been noticing that it doesn't register buttons pushed like it's supposed to. Not to mention that during scorchbeast Queen event it changes the weapon I have selected to even a weapon I didn't previously have selected it likes to switch it to my bow for some reason
---
Honestly tho! Haha
---
Cork looks like the hardest one.
---
The way I see it, the cheaper it is the more people will buy it, i always have my prices relatively cheap because imo I feel like i make way more caps selling things cheap rather than putting them at a "normal"price and waiting for people to buy them. I like people to come to my camp and go "wow thats a deal, I'll take that" not go to every other camp in the world  to compare prices
---
They spawn in the place that you make radiation rumble if I can remember well,  emmet mountain:
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Hazmat_suit_(Fallout_76)
---
If you are in pc I can craft one for you
---
No it doesn‚Äôt I have had game pass since it‚Äôs beginning and had fallout first before it came to game pass. You don‚Äôt get discount on first. I still pay 13 a month
---
You're welcome üòã Every time I put .50 &amp; .308 ammo in my store, I guarantee to sell it all in minutes. People buy it quicker than I can gather the materials to male it, so I spend a day each week on a private server just farming acid, steel &amp; smelting lead ore so that all of you gunners out there are kept stocked up! (Melee only here so I have no need for ammo.)
---
happened twice to me in about 100 times. That's enough not to risk my good shit
---
Whole bunch at rad rumble near white springs
---
Nothing worse than hearing scorched earth or being hit hard by rads and completely losing or forgetting to bring good old hazmat
---
Yeah most people don't like traveling long distances unless they feel they've got good odds to get something they need. Since the gift dupe, people ignore plans unless you're close by other players. 
---
I park myself just south of Whitespring and I never have any trouble selling anything, but I price everything between 1/10-1/4 the value.
---
Don‚Äôt forget corked bats. I know certain sports figures wish you would.
---
I still want to know why its only T-60 armor that gets BoS paints, when all of the BoS corpses in power armor that we find are in T-51 armor. And they usually used T-51 in previous games aside from Fallout 4. Yes, I get that it was a quick and easy asset flip for Bethesda to just throw the stuff on T-60 as they did in Fallout 4, but come on. I just want to be able to run my BoS paint (seeing as I can't get Enclave paints....) on any Power Armor I use.
---
You won't make money for bullion if nobody wants to buy your overpriced ammo.
---
Im the same way, never know if i might need it someday or if my friends need me to upgrade their stuff or if i just wanna put 1000 lamps on the ground at a workshop so ppl that go there wonder wtf is going on there
---
You may be onto something
---
Do you have healing factor mutation?
---
thanks i appreciate the offer sadly i‚Äôm on ps4. lol :-)
---
It will be without doubt start farming it now
---
Yes, way more than I like.
---
Thx, I was thinking about getting 1st again and just wondering if I could now get a discount
---
I do that actually. If someone buys a lot of ammo &amp; I have more on me, I'll hunt them down &amp; drop off the excess as a thanks for shopping with me.
---
Yeah I feel you I have been getting non stop nocturnals literally pulled a noc gat E with RW from queen I was so mad
---
Thats a myth
---
I have only been to a couple of SBQ fights where there are *not* players camped on tents, fences or the bunkers. People are too stubborn and set in their ways ever to change
---
I dont get it either. This one time I had +500 50 cal bullets for 0 caps. They were there for over a week.
---
I just added you üòã
---
Lol okay dude üòÇüòÇü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Not everyone knows that there is a damage threshold to receive loot from the SBQ. 
---
While that‚Äôs common knowledge here among more decorated players that like to stay up to date with changes in the community, that‚Äôs not the case for everyone.  One of my casual friends who had been playing almost a year didn‚Äôt realize the SBQ had special rules. 
---
Now, you say in your OP that Bethesda doesn‚Äôt care, but the reality is they have already announced plans to make relevant changes, like One Wasteland. 
---
I recommend reading up on the upcoming patches to see more details.
---
Is this a roleplaying group?
---
I do. I sell them for a sweet price of 69 caps. Willing to trade though. Name here is same on Xbox.
---
Yeah especially really cheap stuff like .50. Baffling.
---
Yeah, that's something i wish I had more of, bloodpacks. I enjoy making Nuka Cola with my blood in it hahaha
---
Also having the same problem on PC.  Trying to trade with trainstation robot vendors is another problem.
---
I can't wait
---
I just pro-actively farmed plastic because its going to be scare to find in huge numbers during the event. I will contribute but need some for my daily operations ingame.
---
I'm not good enough at pvp, but hunting is way more fun than sneaking. I wish your kill death ratio was worth something. Revives as well.
---
Bear arm is possible with only two, need 3 for stimpak diffuser, not sure but I think you need three for the mod plans for the bear arm
---
Yea they will. I sell basic fixers, and combat rifles all the time. typically Multiples and within an hour every time. Even in these times of anemic servers.
---
Hope the link it's useful then
---
Alright, what is it you would trade them for?
---
Edit: spelling
---
I sell ammo for 2 caps a piece and I‚Äôm level 30
---
Like to bush wookie. Early on hiding between train yard and portside pub. My team mate got killed in the train yard. As fortune would have it  I could see the corpes  being desicrated by there murderer. With an uncharacteristic sense of team solidarity i sniped them. Soon coming to see what had happened to thier team mate another unwittingly entered my sights, and down he went.
---
That is the only time i have managed to snipe anyone, and the only time i got 2 kills in one game.
---
Weird it's basically the worst underarmor then lol
---
I hope we can side against them. I'm a mutant Enclave general with access to nuclear weapons... They *should* want to kill me.
---
Xbox player here on the topic of things who have a power armor station plan I can buy off of
---
I had to do it. I went to hide in a building, and looted some chests. My only intention was to hide. Lucky me, I found some mines. Placed them along the entrance and a bit deeper in. One guy ran through both. I was the only one to walk out of that building.
---
$8.33 USD per month, if you buy a full year. 
---
Other than that?  Only options I can think of would be a discount on the associated XBox cards (like Costco does sometimes). I bought 2 $100 cards for $85 each a while back and my wife and I used them to just grab a full year of FO1st. That technically worked out to $7.08 USD per month. 
---
YMMV. I know dropping that much isn‚Äôt a viable option for everyone.  But I do encourage at least one month (make sure your auto-renew is off) and then spend that month grinding as much scrap as you can and dropping it in the Scrap Box.
---
And the old favorite, enemy turns into a goo pile under the floor on the other side of a wall where you can't loot them at all and just lose the loot.
---
After you open the map, keep "e" pressed after you confirmed the travel.
---
I'm on every day from 9am-3pm M-F, Weekends 8am-6pm, unless I have something IRL happening.    
---
But right now, after posting this last night. Everyone came and cleaned me out... So the stock will be low till tomorrow.
---
Action Boy Lvl 3 is very helpful if you are a VATS shotgunner, especially if you have a "magic shotgun" like I do.  Can take out 4-5 enemies in a row with one hot each in Monster Mash or Riding Shotgun and any survivors will never see you if in CSS and Sneak perk as well.
---
let us know. I'm curious, but it's going to take me a bit longer to get.
---
I don't care if the CEO sleeps with radroaches as long as the plasma cartridges are 1 cap.
---
See, now that would be interesting.  "Align with me or I'll turn Atlas into a glowing crater."
---
If we get the option to side against them then, well, I'm going to need to level my alt!
---
Yeah they need to just get of nocturnals. They‚Äôre useless and only one I keep is that one being it was my first explosive rifle and took me so many legendaries to get. Lol
---
I always check to see if the person in "my spot" is utilizing the resource deposit. Most often they aren't, because they're there for the waterfall just over the hill.
---
Please do not use perks that remove rads from others. Was doing PP with one other dude, got him up a couple times. At the end fighting the squatch, I went down, he gets me up, yay!, Oh wait, huh? I lose all my rads, ffs. Now I am doing like 50-60 damage per bullet, eww. Let other players manage their own rads, pleaseüëç
---
In still sell some/buy some.
---
So people are going to dump junk in bags, won't that disappear when they leave the server, how would anyone know this particular bag of junk has some special purpose?
---
I usually try to take one or two if we don't have anyone else helping us and yeah, we burn through stims like crazy.
---
The Enclave is a much under-appreciated faction. I really wish they'd build on the fact that MODUS has the last operational manufacturing facility in the region capable of building power armor, plasma weapons &amp; other sundry advanced devices....
---
Ooooo, depends what you have! I have 2 characters so I'll check what I have on each one. I am a terrible terrible plan horder. Plans are my weakness üòî
---
It's probably because people want a nice easy answer so they can say 'Beth are lazy/incompetent/sucking up to Dupers etc etc' rather than admitting some problems can't be solved in 30secs by a blind monkey. 
---
I was playing through the first few crossovers without issues even though this was the' proven' trigger.
---
Floaters and cultists have them.
---
Exactly!
---
Haha, yes, same here. I have many plans. Most of them are easily obtainable but i do have some that are a little rougher to come by.
---
May I dm you?
---
Oh I read cartridges as shotgun cartridges üòÜ Hey, I've not been awake long!
---
What would be the stretch goal unlock for 3m toilet rolls do you think? üòÇ
---
No need, you just added me on Xbox üòÅ
---
They are all over the place. They are especially common near any place on the map that has to do with radiation. Waste depots, nuke plants, etc.
---
The earliest one in the game akaik is atop the Posidon Power plant. There are some inside, but im talking about the one that spawns in the hovel on the roof. You can take the catwalk around back to get up there.
---
Having a bit of trouble here too, game is running my memory and cpu up. Game crashed twice in five minutes, is stuttering very badly, and freezing for 10-15 seconds at a time.
---
in Foundation I use the suitcase between the two Sunnys
---
It was like the second days challenges and you'd think every piece of wood scrap counts but no you need to find 100 different wood scrap places. I had 1000 wood from that alone lol
---
I just sell Bulk Lead and Bulk Acid and you can go to town with that.
---
Are there any specific plans you are looking for?
---
From the question I assume you are a noob. The closest one in in one of those small caravan type trailers on the roof of poseiden power plant. the scorched are low level, pretty easy to get.
---
There have been scores of posts from people stating how they lost points to autocomplete logging in after reset. Every single day, for weeks.
---
I sell all ammo for 1 cap and had a player legit clean me out of ammo. I sell fusion cores for 5 caps less then their charge, for example a 100 charger core for 95 caps. And recently decided to get rid of my gauss rifle and sold the ammo for 2 caps apiece
---
What is your group for, PvP for hire?
---
I‚Äôve had to pay that much when I don‚Äôt have a lot of free time to travel to different camps or use the pain in the ass methodical ammo converter
---
hell, if someone revives me when i'm stupid, i'll look at what weapon they are using and drop ammo for them.   Freaked one guy out when I went to my base and came back and dropped 20 plasma cores at his feet (he was only lvl 42), and then gave him a lvl 50 two shot gatling laser.
---
100 times tested. Being on a top of ST doesnt prevent her landing. It is a lie people repeat here over and over again. Staggering her prevents any other movements for a while. It is useless bcz u cant cripple her.
---
no i had one i either scrapped it or dropped it some how. lol  thank you for the advice :-)
---
I am level 30 and shit at games but in love with fallout, the lore, scenery and building aspect but I still feel guilt selling recipes for cool decorations and shit for more than 10 caps and ammo for no more than a cap or 2 depending on the type. I dead ass just walk around and look at trees and water and shit and decorate my cabin.
---
I mean, steel is like the most abundant resource in this game by like a factor of 3, and yet it has the lowest requirement by a lot. Like there are players with 100k+ of the stuff because you can just get it in the thousands for doing nothing special.
---
I feel like they plan for us to have some challenges be so easy they can't fail, others moderate with a small chance of failure, and others like that cork one that are almost meant to fail, then they dish out scaled rewards related to how many succeed,
---
I gifted my missles and nukes.  They take up too much space!
---
Not really, they're just kinda my kryptonite LOL. I'll be getting on the game in a bit...
---
Honestly, I think only the dumbest dupers will donate too much. I think this is a clever way to track players who donate a lot of materials to more closely investigate their accounts.
---
For a while I used a mod that disabled ash/goo piles in Fallout 4. Why the devs have such a hardon for them is beyond me.
---
Pet builds would be a refreshing twist to the game imo.
---
You can get a sentry or assaultron follow you for a bit so what's the harm in having a yao guai, wendigo, or mirelurk king as a permanent companion until you change out your cards or whatever.
---
Dayum!
---
Rewards will drop sometime after the period is up. If the minimum is not met, no reward. But the chances of that happening are really low based on how the other events have gone down. These events are designed to succeed.
---
What exactly is going on in this pic?
---
Alright, well I have a couple hundred plans in total i would say. Since you like plans a lot, I'd be willing to trade some plans you are interested in for the plasma cores?
---
Sweet!
---
Because the dev's know it's a high demand item.
---
Or you become a true legend and chase the chicken ü§î
---
It's time to side with them only to take whatever tech and power armor they have by force.....
---
For MUDOS
---
LONG LIVE THE TRUE AMERICA
---
I fairly consistently sell mine for 20, but I generally only post about 25 at a time. Whenever I hit 25 in my inventory I list them and they go in a few days. I'll do fusion cores for 20-25 (10 if they're less than full) and shotgun for 2. Everything else I either use or recycle into something I use.
---
I use my steel for ammo, I'm always crafting many thousands of 5.56 an 45 to feed my commando addition, how can I scavenge more? For me it just isn't going to be feasible.
---
If they put an actual reward for winning the people that don't win much would throw a fit.
---
Dont' listen to the haters, NW is actually good. Congrats!
---
T65 standard jetpack. It has an exclusive look
---
That's fine but you cant sell or trade so why make is hard to get.
---
20 sounds more than reasonable, just have to get the right person who needs them. Not everyone has a good plasma gun to use them is the main problem
---
Not really. Its tanky enough so long as you dont sperg on damage perks and make sure to get the necessary tank setup.
---
My only real cause of death is getting lazy with rad management and sitting at sub-5% hp for long periods of time, forgetting im at sub-5% hp, then doing something stupid. I can literally sit nose to nose with L80+ bats and they cant see me at all, even as i unload on them. Like close enough that their heads are clipping through my player model.  The massive agi bonus from unyielding makes stealth into nearly god mode.
---
Ya I tried to clip the video on my ps4 afterwords, but it didn‚Äôt work for me for some reason.
---
If Bethesda decied to do that I really hope T-65 BoS PA paint will be bound to BoS reputation:
---
Modern reputation - BOS ranks
---
Hostile - BOS I Initiate
---
Cautious - BOS II Knight
---
Neutral - BOS III Knight sergeant
---
Cooperative - BOS IV Knight captain
---
Friendly - BOS V Officer
---
Neighborly - BOS VI Paladin
---
Ally - BOS VII Elder
---
Edit: instead of reputation ranks we could have BoS ranks! That would be so cool!
---
I haven't seen any minimum for participation, this was just intended as a guidepost for people who wanted to start stocking up.
---
When it launches there will be more info, but it says "all players" will receive the rewards when the goals are met. 
---
That however doesn't include the plans and other individual rewards. I don't know what the system is for that yet.
---
Golf Balls, Hit up Whitespring and Hemlock Holes.
---
So if we as a community we reach that we all get the rewards?
---
There was a dupe glitch with the player vending 2-3 months ago. You put the item you wanna sell in it like ammo or aid and you did some steps and then scrapped it from your camp and doing that makes all the items in your vending machine go straight to your stash. I did it a little too much and was stuck with too much ammo in my stash. Tried asking Bethesda for help but they couldn't remove it rofl. So I removed it myself. A very tedious process but it's all gone minus some extra I kept on my alt. A lv 2 character can only carry around 1.7 million 5.56 rounds but if someone had bandolier then oh boy that's alot.
---
But most importantly...please for the love of all things good and pure, TEST THE PET SYSTEM FIRST.
---
Oh I must have done it but don‚Äôt remember lol
---
If you're not selling it for cheap, or dropping shit on the daily for new players. Oof.
---
I wouldn't.
---
I drop my nukes to barely hit prime and run more north to cover as many locations more bang for the buck then drag her into an open field and have some fun!
---
You don't seem to understand how the game works..  tactics... not suicide.
---
Just craft youre own if you dont like the prizes ,  the economy is broke anyway in f76 becouse of people glitching and duping all the time.
---
Nah
---
Look at the numbers on Steam charts, they only go back to April.
---
Obviously you can't expect steam numbers to be higher after only 90 days, when  bethesda launcher players have been around since the very beginning.
---
It's not hard to put a decent build together to do enough dammage and enjoy the game.
---
Among that, Bounties\Jobs\PvP, or you just need help.
---
Is the Tesla better? Is it worth more? I was offering caps also but I didn‚Äôt go through with it felt like I had better gun
---
Damn was hoping it was a skin, really hate the look of the default jetpack. Thanks.
---
Thanks, yes I bought it a while ago and did that was considering getting it again
---
Yes!!!
---
I grabbed a load of weapons and ammo from a tent, got into my PA.. went back and got the fusion cores, fell in a trench and couldn‚Äôt get out, finally opened fire with my LMG got through 2 and a half mags before the SBQ died and got her rewards...
---
I‚Äôve done several silos with less than 100 rounds.. Chinese stealth Armour is your friend 
---
You don‚Äôt need much!
---
They deserve a nuke
---
How I see it: Popular ammo like 5.56 .308 .45, &amp; 5mm are worth 1 cap each. Ultracite ammo is always 2 caps, and any unpopular ammo should be dropped at train stations, converted, or kept in vendors for free. Myself or anybody else doesn‚Äôt want to spend upto 5 caps per bullet. Also I‚Äôm fine with purchasing all your unwanted 40mm. If I‚Äôm hurting I‚Äôll spend 3 caps on each nade. Just like 25 caps is ridiculous
---
Turn those Goo &amp; Ash Piles into that Pot of Caps loot bag instead.
---
I just get  screen that says initalizing without options
---
Because they think bc their high level their badass, their the same ones who kill legendaries without letting other take a shot first
---
I've never had it happen more than once. Try restarting your ps4 otherwise than sounds awful sorry
---
Avoid legacy guns like the plague, they are all duped.
---
I think yours is a great idea too! We‚Äôre all different, and like to contribute in our own ways as s result. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll make a lower level‚Äòs day!
---
I got lucky with purveyor and got a bloodied fixer last week so my damage is amazing. It‚Äôs not the most wanted fixer but I got so lucky. So it‚Äôs not about doing damage just I got rid all legacies I had because I played since beginning and stash was shit back then you couldn‚Äôt trade so I used the carry weight glitch. When they patched that I was 3k over weight. So I dropped everything or sold to vendor . But I think I‚Äôm going to keep it
---
They'll just nuke you and take the ammo.
---
You more or less answered it yourself. It's to keep players coming back.
---
I meant I wouldn't because trading is dangerous.
---
Exactly. At most, Bethesda might be posting a daily progress scorecard on their website or tweeting updates. The rewards announced will be given out to the entire community after we finish each week. It‚Äôs a pretty simple construct and more achievable than it appears just staring at the numbers.
---
We eat the rich here.
---
Who cares, honestly? What difference does it make? Play for yourself not for others. Bethesda profits from all this "look at what I'm wearing" crap. I honestly don't remember what anyone's character wears so can't judge them on it.
---
You aren‚Äôt the first, friend. Besides, you just have to reach the end of Beckett‚Äôs questline if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre after.
---
I have and it has not worked :/
---
I‚Äôm betting it won‚Äôt and will instead have a more serious tone when compared to the base protectron. Probably spitting out Brotherhood propaganda.
---
Came across a lvl 223 guys camp and he was selling amor, plans, weapons and ammo. Everything except the ammo was set to a minimum of 550 caps, and that was for a few generic weapons and armor. The legendary stuff was being ‚Äúsold‚Äù for 30k.  A 1* lvl 15 left arm was being sold for 1000 which was the cheapest legendary. For the ammo all were 2 except for the .38 ammo which was 1 cap. I bought 1 bullet from him just so it would pop up for him to see one cap. Then I set a bunch of frag mines around his door ways and moved along.
---
Based on what?
---
My main weapon is a shotgun so I burn through plastic like no tomorrow. It's why I tried to get a guesstimate early, so people (and myself) have time to start stockpiling before everyone is hitting up all the good spots.
---
Tesla is worth around 20k caps. The legacy will vary on  the type of energy weapon it is. Some legacies will be worth more than your Tesla.
---
I wouldn't class myself as a toxic player. I'm actually rather humble, and help others as much as possible. But if people exploit the game that causes damage to the rest of the community.... (vendor exploit) was a great example. I'm going to get salty and cause some damage, fair do's right?
---
That's not your concern, citizen.   Just pay the tribute that the Brotherhood demands and there won't be any problems. Ad Victoriam.
---
I sell all ammo for 1 cap each but take the .38, .44, 10mm, and Shotgun Shells to the overseer‚Äôs camp about once or twice a week and drop it all for new players to take.
---
Being the first PC player to offer srapbox space I hope you wouldn‚Äôt mind me taking you up on that offer?
---
Unless its something special like the Nuka and Quantum paint plans, I sell plans at 10% of value.  
---
As for ammo what I don't put through the converter I drop in front of low levels, never sold a single round and don't intend to.
---
Because at double XP there are shades of the earlier Bethesda games not this grindfest.
---
I sell most ammo for 1 cap and plasma cores for 30, plans for 1% the suggested price and chems for 5-10 caps more than what I can get from an AI vendor. It keeps me stocked in caps and my stash weight low. There are always gonna be people that have crazy prices, either its greed or maybe they just thinks its funny and there are suckers everyday that will pay. I saw a guy this morning selling mole rat teeth for 2500 caps. The bottom line is that if don't like someone's prices or inventory don't buy from them there is no sense in complaining about it.
---
Sounds like you don‚Äôt have power running to it
---
They can‚Äôt do this. 
---
The mechanics of unyielding are just screwed up and the set should be heavily nerfed or removed all together - nothing that game breaking should even be in the 76 and we sure as hell shouldn‚Äôt be trying to play that game of ‚Äúcatching up‚Äù to the broken ass gear by breaking more stuff.
---
No worries at all! If you want to message me, we can coordinate. I'll also keep track of what you "donate" to my box so we both know what's rightfully yours.
---
Because they don't understand economics.
---
It's like the government and taxes.
---
What I mean:
---
Let's say there's 100 people paying taxes in this example.
---
The government goes, "wow we've got 100 people paying X, I bet we could get them to pay Y and we'd have like way more money.
---
So the government jacks the tax rate to Y and then suddenly employers have to lay off like a third of the work force because they can't keep paying them.  Then some of those employers just up and move or fold completely and then the government is left with ~50 people paying taxes and the government goes "Now were not getting as much money from taxes.  I know!  Let's raise the tax rate some more to compensate!"
---
Instead of realizing that if they had originally LOWERED the tax rate the number of "taxable" people would have gone UP to 150 and they'd be making (stealing) MORE money from taxes.
---
No, on PC.
---
Same here. I like fighting from Delta.  Hit Prime and the Sundew Grove while barely leaving Delta in the clear.  Maximizes flux for those that need it as well.
---
Personal satisfaction mostly, I don't much care what other people think but I want the grind of achieving something that is recognizable as a grind
---
Mailbox stash limit is too low.
---
As much as that would be cool as shit. I worship mothman. Mothman is love. Mothman is life.
---
Glad I'm not the only one.  It happens to me every time I complete "Powering Up Poseidon".
---
So how long should I sit next to a loot bag before it‚Äôs okay to pick it up then? 
---
*grabs notepad*
---
#6 FTW
---
YO THAT'S GUD SHYT right there! It's absolutely funny as hell when it's like almost the last circle and you just face hug a tree in the shaded side an there's a bush as well to mask your appearance and 4 guys are constantly looking around for someone. Like bro you an 2 of yoyr teammates walked by me and around me like 3 times. In melee distance. Go somewhere else already an lemme sneak to another bushy bush.
---
Sweet man, thanks! Gives me something else to do in game tonight.
---
Yes but you can't level up every 30 mins can you? And if you do then where is the freedom in an open world game? OCD should not be the best skill to bring to an enjoyable video game.
---
Could be
---
Might try it on Earle
---
Sounds like you might need to put your camp down again and start over?
---
I my carry weight but the diet is more from how many individually named items you have in your inventory.  I was hard headed too until I just listened to advice and gave it a try.  Ps4 version is the least optimized version of the game.
---
It increases. If you want fast levels for challenge make a fresh toon and level it, delete, rinse/repeat when needed.
---
start a new character
---
Yep, first thing I did was prime it because its so expensive
---
And especially when I have to go up against people who are level 200+ who seem to never miss a shot and move around like crazy worms and jump and avoid everything.
---
Reinstall. I had to do this 3 separate times.
---
Wait, I'm confused. Is there a way to have the terminals make ammo for you?
---
I use the mail box outside of whitesprings station and also the burlap sack at the overseers camp to help noobs
---
Just start an alt, survive the second ring and voila...
---
That is only true for a few weapons added later in the game like The Fixer, Bear Arm, and Sheepsquatch weapons.
---
Personally I kind of want them to change the cannibal perk so if you use it on a goo pile your character gathers a handful of goo in their hands and then brings it to their lips to slurp it down
---
Haha right?!?!?!
---
Personally I think unyielding armor should just be nerfed to allow other legendary effects to have some value. I have a full SS unyielding set and its just ridiculous how much better it is compared to ANYTHING else (besides chinese stealth armor for nuke zones, that's awesome). I have 500 DR / 400 ER / 400 RR outside PA with +12 all stats -END and I don't even use a bloodied weapon and it still feels really good to play in.
---
It's so good that it makes 0 sense for me to use anything else, especially if you need to farm S.C.O.R.E with experience boost from +12 int. The only time I switch out is if I have to enter a blast zone.
---
I couldn't care less. I took great pleasure in wiping then out in FO4 and their much heralded 'we come in peace' message is little more than a veiled threat. 
---
Unfortunately the powers that be at Beth have decided players Must support their arrival...we'll see...
---
I'll need just a few more settlements in fo76/settlements before that happens anyway
---
I wonder if they juiced on FEV to avoid drug tests in the Fallout world.
---
So delete and reinstall the entire game?
---
when  you get to the last part (you should know it when you get there) Just wait before starting it. There'll be a countdown. Give time for people to join.
---
I'd love that ! Get some beach boys on the radio and a deck chair by the lake..
---
Tbh a brilliant idea, probably the closest some of us are going to get to a beach this year..
---
Don't have to try.
---
People who sell .44 for more than 1 cap should be forced to walk on Leggos.
---
They are the first items to sell.
---
That red deckchair, what plan is it in ?
---
Looks like a really cute camp.
---
Pretty sure we're all synths anyway, I mean we can delete and create characters at will, I mean it says we eat and drink, but there is no animation for it, and I've never taken a  piss or dump......BOS ain't gonna like us :-)
---
I was able to fix or at least bypass the bugs in game myself.
---
What I did was install iRacing and now I just play that.
---
This one. Claim workshop, build some floors, walls and ladders (maybe some lights, wall/floor decores and stash), make a blueprint of it. Every time you will need to do a similar challenge just claim workshop, build with blueprint and leave workshop. It will take few minutes.
---
A fair amount of free stuff has returned a second time, but there is no way to predict the if or when of any of it.
---
Npc for quests with the raiders
---
I still see people selling 38 for 1 cap...
---
Who buys 38?
---
It‚Äôs a repeatable quest hub, and I use that term very generously.
---
Haha I love seeing these creative gems! Well done! ü•á
---
I think it was essentially the same system that attracted the scorched in the "Line in the sand" event, but dont trust me, go to the "Its a trap!" Event if you see it, its boring and lower level but it's how they introduce you to killing scorchbeasts
---
&gt;  The only time my build even matters
---
So true. Once you're level 100 or so and have solid gear and even a half decent build, everything just sorta wilts before you. Outside of encryptid, you can roll all 8s, random select your cards and just lean on your best legendary to solve 98% of your problems.
---
I think part of the issue is you have no real area of effect options. I can't _really_ heal my group, I can't _really_ interact with them in any useful way. The lunchboxes help, I guess? It'd be nice if I could be a medic without first having to perfect Project Paradise to get a Diffuser plans. Alternatively, I have to wait for you to perish before I can help you, and even then, if you take like 5 damage past your last HP, you're insta-dead anyways (stupidest fucking mechanic in the game)
---
It's times like this you're reminded this is a single player game masquerading as a multiplayer one.
---
Oh right, I kept getting close and they would just shoot me
---
Right but thats because wastelanders launched with the steam launch (which would be another tick for steam having more subscribers inherently than beths launcher) and there was a highly publicized free copy given for linking your steam account and Bethesda ran a membership transfer service for yearly subscribers as well as Steam being 1000000% more popular than Bethesda's launcher which means more exposure which means higher potential for sales which if anything would mean the steam numbers would always be higher. That doesn't really make sense to me. Why would it be more likely more players are staying with the beth launcher (which is incontestably worse than steam) or that more new copies are still being sold via bethesda.net when during purchase on beth.net you are given a choice between either? You could qualify me as the hardest of fo76 gamers since the beta and I jumped at the chance to get off of Beth's launcher and my sub is now paid via steam. If you are trying to say somehow bethesda's launcher is outselling steam I would call for more proof but there is definitely a small portion of the pc playerbase still playing on beth's launcher that needs to be accounted for. 
---
All that to say there is no way your estimate of 45k active on pc across all launchers is accurate. Its just not possible. That would mean 30k players are subscribed and still playing via bethesda.net which I do not see as being realistic. All the new players are coming from xbox gamepass which is via the Windows store/xbox and I would again say its more likely that gamepass subscribers are more often than not console players who double dip occasionally and that the number of straight pc players who are only playing because of gamepass would logically be pretty small. For example I subscribed to gamepass every so often to play sea of thieves, but do not own an xbox. I am in the minority of sea of thieves players by doing that so I dont think its too far of a stretch to assume the same for 76.
---
She is one of the NPC's that help you level up your faction rep for the raiders. If you bring her mirelurk meat, softshell mirelurk meat, or queen mirelurk meat, you increase your rep with them, once a day. That's probably why you cannot kill her.
---
They're essential NPC's that give you raider activities. You can turn in different cuts of mirelurk meat as well as help defending their operation against mirelurks.
---
I think I understand it more than you 
---
You can play NW however you want. But the bush wookies are annoying and drag the matches on. As well as just being useless slots on teams with actual players. Getting rid of flora doesn't get rid of cover. But it gets rid of one of the most annoying types of players. Without much consequences to other playstyles
---
Now I must see yours. Pics perhaps?
---
I got mine in the middle of the road where it was prohibited near the Wayward. Got asked a lot how I did it, I just reply by "Dunno, just got determined i guess".
---
Oh my god I check nothing another thing to add to my list
---
Yes its an easy way to go with creating a lvl1 and you can do the lvl up 1 time and NW as well. Unfortunately I have 2 mains 3 lvl 70+ alts so I have to delete one if I want to use it.
---
Here is an easy workaround 10k xp for daily lvl up for weekly = Profit.
---
you need to start the quests for the raiders for them to stop shooting at you
---
I would consider the fact that not everybody who plays this game follows these subreddits and/or don‚Äôt know how much caps/items are going for out there in the markets. As if there‚Äôs hard rules on how much a bullet should be in the wasteland.
---
Other than maybe wiping a whole team by yourself at the end, this would be the most satisfying way to win. I about killed the guy that had just launched a nuke the other day, but I didn‚Äôt have enough firepower.
---
AND only show the item for sale. No outfits with a helmet that don't come with a helmet. No backpacks on outfits without backpacks. Etc. (Same with camp items: showing all the items in a bundle with wallpaper and other items not in the bundle is... confusing at best.)
---
Seems like it's this week.  My game crashed 2 nights ago when I was on a private server, and bam.  Get bluescreen'd.  Powering up Poseidon proved fruitless and I was upset.  Had to re-power up Poseidon Energy Plant again.
---
Grahm is literally always at my or my friends camp, its weird.
---
Yeah I hear ya! I‚Äôm a professional toilet wookie and trying to ranking up in a port-o-potty is nutty‚Äôr than my last turd
---
I do the same... I love changing up my camp and you never know when that broken toilet will be just the right thing for a build.
---
Seriously, I like to do stupid stuff. Like I built my base on top of the double restrooms on the edge of whitespring just to be weird. I also created a storeroom where I piled up various holiday decorations, paintings and useless camp items. No purpose but to show off crazy crap without needing context.
---
You aren‚Äôt ruining anyone‚Äôs game by killing them lol
---
Besides an official response that said they were gonna be looking into it, there have been no new updates. It's probably low on the list
---
My buddy got a uny/rr/cav chest on his 3rd ever roll lol
---
Yep, I already did that. Got 4k ammo from all my stashed flux
---
I was once a humble sea Wookiee....
---
Then I became a shark.
---
Stupid removed rules.  Your great post is gone, but not forgotten.
---
top of my head. tesla coils. shocks. rebar.
---
those 3 definitely.
---
wait are you talking plans?
---
Targeting hud, emergency protocols, calibrated shocks. I know those are rare
---
I cant keep ammo in my vendor at 1 cap apiece. So i put my 5.56 at 2 and they sell no problem.
---
I do sometimes to see what someone else has done there. And the other day i did, and they were a bit down the river and it was almost jarring to see "my" plot of land with nothing there. It looked so lonely without my camp. XD
---
Deathclaw is better. But, I'm pretty sure the powerfist is better with its mods. Unarmed is the best for bloodied builds that dont use power armor
---
Higher is better.  Leather is better against energy weapons
---
Deathclaw is better.
---
Yeah plans sorry
---
Check this one, shows you the % chance for the different plans to drop.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/g3dqwa/plan_and_mod_database_wastelanders_update_is_now/
---
And to make matters worse it takes days to scrip unwanted rolls that take up valuable stash space.
---
It's weird that when I see those holes on those creatures that they make me feel not just disgusted, but fir some reason a bit upset too. Even then, I am glad the rad toads and that giant Bee queen were designed like this.
---
Ok cheers
---
Pick a different character?
---
The event is called ‚ÄúOne Violent Night‚Äù
---
You can give them the  best gun in the world and you know they'll still use their shitty default to attack scorchbeasts.
---
/has a flashback to Boone running into a nest of deathclaws with a machette..
---
For me it happens almost immediately upon logging into game. I'll just try to Port somewhere and I have to try seven times for it to actually go through and get me where I'm trying to be. Whatever happened to Beth and its ability to register button pushes is a bit beyond me apparently.
---
Cheers, that helps a lot
---
"You know, when they're getting new content or features or whatever, they're going to get that for free. All the DLC, all the POST LAUNCH STUFF, it's all going to be free."
---
That's a Pete Hines quote. He mentioned DLC, he also mentioned that all of the post launch stuff, and all of the new content and features would be free. Unlimited scrap storage is 100% a gameplay feature and no amount of mental gymnastics will get you out of that one.
---
He also promised that they would "only sell cosmetics", which basically throws out the need for this entire argument. If he promised that only cosmetics were going to be sold, then things like Fallout 1st and "utility items" shouldn't even be on the table.
---
The NW challenges are not difficult, overall. And there is plenty of SCORE available, should anyone choose to avoid NW on principle. 
---
I guess my point is... people complaining about NW are 1000x worse than NW.
---
I'm onboard with this. The repurposed Liberator in the Wastelanders quest made me really want one to just follow me around. If it has to have a purpose, give it like... Pest control, let it zap radroaches and stuff so I don't have to punch them.
---
My next goal is to team up with somebody and drop two at once one hitting prime one hitting sundew I wanna have a NORAD zone in between the two and hope I can get Earls cousin brother Bob to come play with the queen
---
I mean if its prime ammo I can see but god not regular ammo
---
Oh my God has anybody else had the situation where it is ported you somewhere completely other than where you select it?
---
Yeah man what's with that? Straight robbery
---
Maybe the reward is for the teams.... collect a bunch and then everything gets allocated randomly, or maybe by their individual placement.
---
The complaint I‚Äôm hearing though is that there‚Äôs no victory lap for the winner.
---
Hmmmm you have a valid point. Maybe the health bar is just our battery %  and when our health is 0 the synth losses power and spawns a new body. I mean we live forever without any sleep and I know only a synth is capable of that.
---
Yeah I was kind of irritated once because I was in a silo and the prep was going, then some other random dude showed up during the prep and after everything was done popped his keycard in before I could.
---
I was going to launch for the queen and he did too, but basic etiquette man.
---
Well...its a race to the end...the best one wins...if I beat u I will put it on what I want....most likely on someone's house
---
Liberator Prime
---
I like both playstyles; unarmed melee speedy dude and Junkie's heavy Power Armor tank. But when I'm playing as a heavy Power Armor and doing the defend section it's kind of sad watching an unarmed melee player trying to zip around the room and here I am taking everything out  before he can get to it. I was generous and held off on shooting some of them so he could land hits.
---
Yes, it's a bug with the camo paint. With it applied, other mods cannot be installed.
---
Cool thank you for the info.
---
UPVOTED great idea!
---
It doesn't look that special, it was just a ball ache to do because of the way the camp system punishes you for trying anything different! But it looks pretty natural and more friendly. What console you on? I'm on Xbox if you want to see it lol.
---
I do believe I just redid my mutations but it was happening while I didn't have healing mutation on 2 but that is an interesting question cuz I can't guarantee I didn't have healing mutation cuz it is one of my favorite.
---
Maybe our ED-E ends up being the inspiration for the NV one. Piper doesn't exist yet but we got her outfit
---
I like it, I guess mostly because I rarely win. Dying don't make me go "oh no, how terrible, I was robbed of the chance at winning", but instead "I wish I could have gotten some more points but I had fun with what I was doing"
---
It'd be nice if you got something for winning, but the fact you're not losing out on anything makes it more fun to be in any of the other 48 (assuming a full team of 4 wins) positions.
---
I love it too but I wish there was some more songs
---
What‚Äôs the desired prefix for junkies? (I‚Äôm saving junkies weapons for when I want to take a break from bloodied.)
---
25/25 is ur god roll option if ur going automatic.
---
I constantly drop Ammo or give it away for free.
---
Thank you! And thanks for defending this noob for  just asking a question.
---
Only luck 9, I salute you
---
So here is my daily ritual, that has worked for me.  Been hit with bug twice, and what follows has worked from then on.
---
Play as usual day before.
---
In morning while I eat breakfast I log in each character on a private server, reset their vendor timer with a bobby-pin, each time I quit the game to character select menu, I don‚Äôt close it.  Final time I quit game then close it (close meaning ummm end it in ps4, I call that closing).  I do not check atom shop, I do not look at legendary run.  I make sure I‚Äôm done with this by 845, and I don‚Äôt play until 915, though most days I go in to work.  Weekends I follow the 845/915 rule, making sure I just play game and log out of final character after I‚Äôm done if I do mess around on a weekend morning.  So far this works fine for me but I‚Äôm sure many people do a very similar thing and have had issues.
---
I have 5 characters and I have no idea which one I‚Äôll play each day, so the vendor resetting I‚Äôm sure isn‚Äôt required, but what id call ‚Äúrefreshing‚Äù each character, well I don‚Äôt know if it is required but I sure as hell do it.  This means I don‚Äôt keep up with which one did NW the day before if I did it, because they all touch base in adventure mode.
---
My two ‚Äúfails‚Äù occurred once right after a NW match then logging to adventure, another because I was online during the reset.  Coincidence?  Perhaps.  There‚Äôs more than one hook to this problem, or else I‚Äôd like to think Bethesda would have figured it out by now.
---
Give it a weapon mount and make it a Power Armor skin
---
So I can just leave my private server, switch characters and it will put me right back into the same server?  Learn something new everyday
---
I sell every ammo for 1 cap, but fusion and plasma cores I sell for how much charge is left. I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs a good practice or not
---
I plug my PS4 controller in to use instead of key and mouse. But have made sure it is not my controller
---
I have to really hold back during meat weak because my unarmed melee character can zip around and kill just about everything in one hit, often before the ranged weapon dudes can land hits. So, I have to hold myself back in order to share in the splendor. However, this often leads to me taking more damage than necessary so that sucks.
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt really get that
---
It seems to be one of the one that can trigger the glitch. I can‚Äôt confirm 100%, but will say I never get it anymore and do not have that mutation. I‚Äôve seen a lot of other people reporting the same thing.
---
When I did my 1st Nuke solo, I wasn't aware how to pick a location.  So I did it in the exact center of a location.  Maaaay have blown up 2 or 3 players' C.A.M.P.s.  Again, it's my 1st Nuke solo.
---
I love my junkies lmg, but I just couldn't justify using it until it was primed. The materials to support it are way too high.
---
No problem. Reddit has made a habit of downvoting people asking simple questions and it really pisses me off.
---
If I see the silo is in prep I'll bail, but if someone is sneaking around the place, and I can't see them on the map on the way there, or while running through, sorry but I'm launching.  That's the problem with sneaky-sniper folks. Can't see they're there.
---
So are you saying that since not having healing factor you have had only normal troubles traveling?
---
Deathclaw Gauntlet.
---
I believe it's part of the elegant couch set you get from whitesprings
---
Yes thank you, there are many misconceptions about Jets creation. In fact, you can even make Myron begin to worry if you continue to press him about Jet since he‚Äôs lying about creating it.
---
Take workshops... Don't even bother defending them. Soon you'll be swimming in stims, radaways and purified water
---
Ah yes, Ive seen that. But I get the same results with my "reduce damage while blocking by 15%" arm
---
I run with a full secret service vanguard armor set, berserker, dodgy, scaly skin mutation and a few other effects that I can't remember. With my vampire minigun I pretty much can't be killed. Encrypted I can tank no problem. It's not a heavy damage build at all, but you are right. Done well it's pretty broken.
---
Though a bit off topic, I got to say: The unlimited junk storage should be for everyone. Events like this prove it.
---
I‚Äôm sure you know, but hitting-up the monorail elevator a lot gives 70 concrete and about 80 lead.  Grab enough junk to get it to reset and it makes for easy accumulation.
---
Nah it‚Äôs existed pre-war. Vault 95 and hounding Myron makes him nervous since he didn‚Äôt create it but instead simplified the process of making it.
---
I have done this so many times üòÇ. What frustrates me even more is when the fast travel cancel glitch keeps happening or I server hop into same server not realising and spend 42 caps travelling to vendor I visited 20 mins previous
---
Yup, you have 5-10 minute window.  5 minutes if you want the server to stay, 10 mins if you‚Äôre trying to reset it.
---
Private servers I‚Äôd say are 95-99% safe, but not foolproof for transfers.  Shit happens on your end or Bethesda‚Äôs end from time to time, so there is always risk.
---
With how much you have to do for a NW rank up the 250 is too low. It should reward you the same as a level up
---
Sounds good, but I would add a little something to that. I spent countless hours on a brutal and excruciating grind for all of those T60 paints. I unlocked them all including Elder.  It would be very nice if earning them all for the T60 meant skipping the BOS grind entirely.  I feel like I have already earned my stripes with the BOS.
---
I think all of that Tech data farming needs to be recognized in some way when the BOS finally arrive. I feel like I have already been busting my ass for them dammit, and I want recognition.
---
Scrap boxes only store stacked items, it's one line followed by a number.  Stash boxes on the other hand, store umpteen weapons &amp; armor with different mods, stats, condition etc ... Same for food.  It's a lot more information the server has to load from stash compared to the scrap box.  Your argument is flawed.
---
What about the ones who‚Äôs name shall not be spoken?
---
Did you find a fix for this? I am currently having this exact issue..
---
A week or two ago, I was trying to turn in Mirelurk Products and someone kept shooting them.
---
I mean, I didn't care, but I just wanted to sell the meat and move on and it took forever because this guy kept knocking them down and wouldn't let me just finish the stupid quest.
---
Is there a reason its consider a god role? Isn‚Äôt faster fire rate on something with an already decent high rate of fire a waste of legendary effect. Sorry if its a stupid question i only just recently started running commando full time. Pretty much every other fallout game i run heavy guns or semi auto rifles.
---
It‚Äôs a trade only item, won‚Äôt sell for caps unless the owner doesn‚Äôt know how rare it is.
---
Yea, happens to me on Xbox. I‚Äôve found running 10+ feet usually helps
---
It looks like you're converted for now, but when you want to upgrade to a level 40 or 50 set check out fo76map.com
---
You can filter the map for all the PA spawns and it'll tell you which type appear at each location. You may have to check a few places and possibly b server hop, but it shouldn't take long to get a full set of T51 or t60.
---
You also get a full set of ultracite PA when you finish the BOS quest.
---
Look like a young Geddy Lee.
---
Pretty much need to.  Ignoring the materials, I don't want to have to spam the craft button 100 times just to get a few minutes worth of ammo either.
---
No. That is the final level. You can check each level before you level up.
---
Just as a word of warning fo1st isnt 100% I had a server crash and lost some stuff for my alt including uny chest piece üò•üò•üò• friends are the way forward 
---
Love some of your suggestions though
---
So guy on here suggested it might be a healing factor mutation do you have that one on?

---
&gt; My only guess is that I keep my camp up on the far corner of the map, up above deathclaw island.
---
I'm only going there if I already have a quest in the area and your camp is a faster fast travel point than where I'm trying to go.
---
No like plasma and stuff like that. And I feel that even though I've been awake for 8 hours ü§£
---
Yeah, there‚Äôs absolutely no reason to ever charge full price. I certainly don‚Äôt and I honestly make a good amount of caps. Probably more than people who sell stuff for full price.
---
&gt; Im lvl 39 and i just realized yesterday that fusion cores should be priced from 10-50 caps not default price because i had a very angry customer complain
---
Fuck them. There is no reason you should give them way cheap, especially since you'll use them yourself eventually.
---
I've been running a solar vanguard build w/ Vampire LMGs. I have a primed ffr for the queen and an explosive for everything else. I rip through 308 ammo so I also run a vampire puncturing power fist fss. With grounded and strange in numbers I can face tank assaultron head lasers.I'm practically unkillable. You really dont need to be bloodied or unyielding to be successful in this game. 5k sneak melee crits are great, but complete overkill. If you are really worried about dmg instead of survivability you can run junkie weapons instead.
---
Oh well.....üòÜ
---
Yeah but it's breaking the lore of the game
---
1 cap or gtfo. Maybe they are just lazy and don't adjust their prices?
---
I no longer have any trouble fast traveling
---
I'm on ps4 Jaffa_jizz feel free to abuse me üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
I would love some reward for having won, an overseer jumpsuit maybe?  Overseer hat?  Hell notches on the jumpsuit for how many wins you have would be cool!
---
Fortnites(rip) seasonal umbrellas come to mind - if you won a match in the season you get an umbrella unique to the season.  
---
But I just imagine the backlash if winning gave atoms or anything to benefit the players much.  NW gets so much hate on here, and people get pretty outraged at suggestions of rewards that you can't afk bot or bush wookie for.
---
Actually no, you gotta tax the rich to get rich and you get more it‚Äôs basic math
---
If you don't buy any of the stuff that costs extra money ...
---
You are still able to experience the entirety of 76's core experience, all of its playable content. 
---
You can play through every single bit of 76s content with out paying an additional dime.
---
This is one of those rare occasions when i would have nuked the guys camp
---
Yeah... Not a fan of those people who use auto grenade launchers and such on the group spawn of scorched, they don't give anyone else XP.
---
If you are using hard bargain and have high charisma, herd mentality in a group and a few other things you may already be capped out.  I can get best price for serum recipies (best test imho) without grape mentats on several characters.
---
Yeah true. Idk on the fence about it. Tired of seeing every server with people having 40 legacies but again don‚Äôt need my account suspended after receiving the gun
---
I must have missed something. 
---
Can I get a quick rundown of what this "atlas" thing is please.
---
They are pretty common
---
I was mostly saying it for effect. I don't greif either and I'm pretty sure Bethesda doesn't have another plan so it wouldn't matter. It's just a gimmick to grind more rewards, I get it. I'll leave the kids alone
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say never again but maybe not over 1000. I finally broke down and got first a few months ago because I was sick of not being able to play fallout the way I enjoy it‚Äîpicking up everything in sight.
---
Do you have hard bargain at level 3?
---
Not just fast travelling. I VATS an enemy (melee if it matters and xbox) and they take no damage for upwards of 4 VATS attacks!  While I see other people dealing damage to the same target just fine?
---
Sadly there were highly duped so very low value.
---
Or maybe they could randomly come up to you with something they found? Like hey, look dad, a live grenade!
---
I'm not complaining about NW to each their own, i'm not a pvp player so I have no idea if it is a good or bad pvp game.  I just don't want my actions to negatively impact the game play of someone else.  
---
As for enough score available, the amount of time I have available to play,  I worked out that it will take me over 12 weeks to earn enough score to reach the end without using the NW score (yes I worked it out to see if I can ignore NW) and even with the NW score i'm probably going to have to buy at least 4 levels..  
---
So i'm just saying, if Bethesda want to "force" people to play NW, then they should at least look at minimising the effect that mindless drones like myself have on the players that actually want to be there.
---
Because they want to get rid of the stuff but they also want caps. It‚Äôs their choice what they do with it and your choice whether to buy it or not. It‚Äôs still cheaper than buying it from vendors
---
Oh, yeah that's definitely handy! Nice! I'm right in thinking that makes any weapon magic? Well, any Shotgun or high fire rate weapon?
---
Thank you :) no worries I was just curious didn't know what to price them at
---
Do you only get the rewards if you donate?
---
Oh yes this problem too but I don't know if they are related. It seems to be in that one a failure to fully recognize the target if the first 95% shot doesn't hit them I back out and reconnect with my vats
---
Ok no problem. It's seems like we only know a bit about it which is fine. I'm sure we'll get all the details next week.
---
Omg.  That‚Äôs horrible.  I‚Äôve been doing 100% swaps between characters. If I lost all my bloodied gear I‚Äôd be sad
---
Yeah.  On one of my alts I skipped a lot of stuff. I leveled up to 4 and just started taking Tyler Park racetrack. One I captured I would log-off and restart.  I kept a meager camp nearby, too.  So a quick 25 caps to capture, along with some meds.  Rinse and repeat. 
---
Boring as heck, but it‚Äôs easy.
---
Nope, ive submitted multiple support tickets and nobody seems to care
---
Yes, but shotgun needs to be on vats
---
If you want to know more check out angry turtles ultimate video on the subject.
---
Cool, but again, that's not what promised, so that doesn't matter.
---
They promised that everything post launch except cosmetics would be free. When you bought the game, you bought into that promise. Changing their minds a year after release to shove a shit subscription service in everyone's face is a really garbage move.
---
Absolutely! If it's in the vending machine, it's going to be priced at one cap per core! We can also do custom orders at reasonable prices at slightly higher price-per-round (may not be available on a daily basis, please consult the customer service representative for more information). We think you'll LOVE the Packtray Difference[tm]!
---
I bought my Santa for 100 caps.  Then I found a dropped bag with 4 more.  I sold those for 100 caps each (PS4).
---
When you are exploring, make sure you search red tool boxes.
---
This is some of the most stellar and informative information I've read ever regarding fallout 76. Will do exactly this when I get in tonight. Thanks so much. It's hard to think how to go about such things but in writing sounds very straight forward.
---
CHA has a cap for buying/selling of 20/25 (not which cap is which) Hard Bargin adds 3 CHA per level for calculating buying selling costs. 
---
So, as a Junkie Grape Mentats will give a +6 swing to your CHA, add in HB3 and you got +15 Swing. So you are probably hitting one if not both Caps.
---
Maybe one of them but the other I‚Äôve seen their social menu but I‚Äôm not there
---
Those reports are fabricated by Big Radio to help competitor firms, and Packtray has never visited the Southern Belle Motel on any occasion.
---
I hate when higher levels target lower levels. I'm at 202 and I play with pacifist, I play for the Fallout aspect, not too keen on the PVP aspect. What's the RP?
---
Sorry to disappoint, but they probably won't. Afaik, Dion was absolutely not happy that the song was used with violent content (paraphrasing here) when featured in FO4's trailer. And I even read somewhere about alleged lawsuits against Bethesda but I'm not sure if it's true or the outcome of it.
---
There was a guy once who was shooting the group as it spawned in mid air, instakiled everything.
---
What I've found works best the rest of the time is an explosive LMG. Without perks it's like 30 damage and 3 or 4 explosive, and with the fire rate a quick sweep firing at the ground will tag them all. It'll go through 1000 rounds in one event if you aren't careful though.
---
I tried to make one mule, too boring logging in and out and trying to manage inventory that way. I try to play with as little waiting or loading screens as possible, and am already furious at the silly waiting games in the base game. Also what you recommend is technically an exploit. We need to demand some kind of accountability from companies who market/sell their products to children, who don't know any better, not figure out boring workarounds. Why not just open Excel and close it over and over smh
---
well, I never bothered with legendaries on low levels, its just wasted time since you'll outgrow them so fast. hit lvl 45-50 as soon as possible so actual legendary drops mean something.
---
As for stims I feel like I've always had more than I could use up, mainly doing the main quest line before wastelanders and the V79 quest line after wastelanders. Spice things up with events of all kinds as soon as you see them, try to tag every enemy with a bit of dmg and let the bloodied guys kill them. IF there is another double exp event, do events with hordes of enemies - Rad Rumble is awesome, went from lvl 21 to 30 during ONE event (full unyielding lvl 5 leather armor set, event group). And lastly, the best stuff is traded for or found in player vendors, good RNG drops are a bitch and pretty much always a dissapontment.
---
Just enable the bloody mess effect for everything. Something satisfying about them pop into pieces.
---
I know your pain. It took me almost a year to obtain all BoS T60 paints (except initiative). And I still do not have all T60 part plans.
---
I agree with you. I really want to see what will happen when I will come to ATLAS using my T-60 Elder paint. But I do not think Bethesda will reduce farming even for Elders. Maybe Bethesda will give Elders of Appalachia some scrip like Bethesda did with Overseer's holotapes. I hope for a funny easter egg at least.
---
They should, but hard bargain significantly increases the vendor caps.  Grape mentats doesn‚Äôt have as much of a significance as you‚Äôd think.  Not sure how it equates.  But I‚Äôm CH 4 and without hard bargain at 3, a rare outfit will sell for like 15 coins.  With bargain it‚Äôs 22.  With grape mentats it‚Äôs 25.
---
Another example, I recently bought some t51 calibrated shocks.  With my perks and maybe an +1 from alcohol it was like 1950.  With grape it was like 1850.  Close estimates but it only was like 100 coins less.  So I imagine the margins are much smaller for low priced stuff
---
Not sure what nuke placement effect is on mobs, but the scenario with mass mobs charging would actually be my favorite. Makes Scorched Earth much more fun IMO then sitting around counting damage on the Queen.
---
At Packtray's C.A.M.P., plans are also only one cap (one cap price may not apply to jet pack plans, please consult the on-site customer service representative for more information)!
---
Came here to say this.
---
There was a supposed bug a few months back of NPCs taking your loot after you died and attacking you with your own weapons. That's totally something I wouldn't want to happen.
---
On a related note, my first off NPC encounter, I was clearing out the clubhouse at The Whitespring and heard some NPC taunts and the sound of ghouls dying. Get to a room and find a Legendary Raider going around and taking MY kills! Bad enough to lose them to another player üòÇ
---
This fucking game..
---
I price all my plans super cheap (10% of the silly high value given to it max). Low levels snap them up if they don't have them yet
---
My 38 goes into my ammo convertor same with missiles and grenade rounds
---
From now on every time you poop you will think ‚ÄúThis must be what a radtoad popping an egg out feels like‚Äù.
---
I do run all unyielding and I believe I run herd mentality.
---
I don‚Äôt use Hard Bargain.
---
My base charisma is only at 2. Maybe unyielding and herd is enough to max it out though?
---
Regardless of all this, still just wondering in general, does having the mentat addiction mute the bartering buff of grape mentats?
---
Packtray works tirelessly to give the customer base what they want, at prices they can afford. That's the Packtray Difference\[tm\]!
---
I don't get it either. I'm lvl 170 (I'd be way higher if I didn't spend so much time fucking around), and any ammo is 1 cap. It moves quickly. I always have plenty for myself (thanks Ammosmith and Super Duper!), plus all of the ammo I pick up that I don't use (mostly 5mm). I sold nearly 17k rounds yesterday right after I restocked. I expect to make 10kish today when I do a smaller restock.
---
Ammo: 1 cap
---
Fusion core: 60 caps for 100%, 50 caps for 75%, 35 for 50%, chuck the rest
---
Plasma core: 20 caps, 100% only
---
Don't sell explosive ammo
---
Even 2mm EC, I sell for 1 cap. I've sold it at 2 caps before, but it takes too long to sell. I have so much of it, I sell anything past 2500 rounds
---
Thanks! I hope there will be a way to store more everything without lvling and perking our mules.  we already have scrapbox for 1st why it is so hard to make medic boxes or ammo boxes or any static objects boxes.
---
Hahaha, I like your style. I'd be willing to buy 50 plasma cores or so. Maybe a bit less. It depends. How much would 50 be?
---
I have a junkies explosive pipe rifle and I get 120 damage with the automatic receiver on it. It's great for about 75% of the map. And I'm not using ultracite 45 to kill low level enemies.
---
And?
---
Why you ask? Because people pay it, shitty but it happens. Only thing I sell above 1 cap is full charge fusion cores and Ultracite ammo, the rest is a common type found.
---
Most ammo a cap.  Anything else, the price ends in 76.   Got to represent my vault
---
This is why I always bring a FFR cryolator.  If she won't land I blast it with cryo until it's moving so slowly in the air it may as well be a "sitting" duck.  It usually dies pretty quickly after that.
---
The lore matters a lot
---
I've been baffled, in general, by how reluctant Bethesda Austin is about disabling problems if they don't have the time to fix them.  Yes, we'd all prefer if these things were properly fixed, but at the same time, if that fix isn't going to come around for another six months, maybe you just need to disable the problematic behavior instead.
---
I'm xb1 too, maybe I could join your server one day? I could give you a bit of my extra chems in return
---
I just want a way to turn off the "stings and things" quest that WILL NOT GO AWAY NO MATTER WHAT I DO!  OH GOD IT KEEPS COMING BACK, PLEASE MAKE IT STOP!
---
Never would I think of it! I quick run a great number of silos on a daily basis, and whenever I come upon another player already in the silo I help them. For anyone running silos it can be a great waste of resources, for the meager end reward. It doesn't do anyone any good to make it take longer. If they don't nuke a spot I like I move to another server, and launch there.
---
You're not ruining...a NW match...by killing someone. O.o
---
You named your donger "attention"?
---
Oh yeah, me too. And Todd picked the perfect moment: he got some of my best legendaries. One cannot stop living because of the vagaries of mad gods
---
Are we talking ultracite or regular? 
---
I just like crafting ammo. Maybe it's because I do it as a hobby in real life or something, I don't know. If I had materials all the time, I'd probably build my own free ammo depot on the server and be done with it.
---
i had mine in my vendor for 1 cap each
---
but did u retrieve the "flight recorder"? u have to wait like 2 minutes until u have it.
---
Absolutely.
---
When he mentions post launch stuff immediately after DLC, he's clearly referring to DLC. Context matters. 
---
Do I think some things like the fridge and scrap box should be earnable without money? Sure. 
---
Do I think that statement meant everything should be free? No.
---
Sorry I didn‚Äôt answer that part, not at all, as a junkie you get the full effect of drugs when you use them, with the caveats of not all being usable at once.
---
You can't change the wind brother, but you can change your sails
---
I thought 1 cap/ammo was the average. I sell ALL ammo excluding the ones I use (5.56, 10mm, .45, and shells) for 1 cap and I‚Äôm only a level 30 who could DEFINITELY use the extra caps haha. I‚Äôve started hoarding the .38 and dropping it off at the overseers camp every time I‚Äôm online there‚Äôs no sense in charging low levels for the weakest ammo.
---
The overseer will give you the quest that you need to talk to each factions' leader, but to get to the raiders you need to do Rose's questline at the Top of the World.
---
The only thing that comes to mind, and I'm not sure it's actually a thing, is modding a Plasma Pistol to have the Flamer Barrel.  While not technically a magic weapon, if the Gunslinger perks apply to that like Rifleman's do when it's a Plasma Rifle, you'll be able to burn your way through anything short of the SBQ in a second.
---
Course, a well-specced Bloodied Gunslinger could also do that at a distance with a Western Revolver, but it's not nearly as spray-and-pray.
---
If you've got an empty bottle you should be able to bottle it too.
---
Ooooh that‚Äôs good to know I‚Äôm lvl 5 atm lol
---
I got over 1K of them on a mule. Very heavy though.
---
Thanks for the reply...I‚Äôm not running HB3.
---
Herd + unyielding maybe is pushing me to the max and that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt notice a difference when I pop grape?
---
Out of curiosity though still wondering if mentat addiction negates grape‚Äôs effect when you pop it?  I can always test it myself but just thought someone might know the answer
---
I uh.... Would love to know how to make a kill base good sire. Or madam. Dm me details?
---
Ya my main can throw down but I dont target people. I only defend what's mine and help out low lvl haha. RP is role playing. Just having fun with an archer. No bloodied, no junkies, no mutations. Just an archer hunter gatherer ‚ò∫Ô∏è. But his guy probly didnt know I had concentrate fire and a quad crossbow üßê
---
I always just give ammo and plans away. If you ever come across me. I'm minibear. Just ask if I have it to give I will.  Thanks
---
I usually leave a mule in my private world when I change character, non-1st accounts are not kicked out immediately.
---
Leveling mules up to lvl 5 or 10 unlocks some good weight redux perks for chems, food, junk. giving them scrip to roll up some low lvl 3star armor with weapon, ammo or other weight reduction abilities is icing on the cake.
---
I like the micro management of this, but its not for everyone.
---
Ah you have scratched my itch...thank you kindly good sir
---
Edit: one more question...what do you mean by that caveat?
---
I found the prosnap on an alt but haven't had much luck finding them on my main and other alts, maybe I'll give it another shot. That top image, the one shown on here might as well be a wallpaper on bethesdas site, I'm sure pleanty of players would rock them on their desktop. Lol
---
Cause three they're assholes
---
Regular.
---
And oh neat, that sounds like fun!
---
If anyone is on XBox and wants to use my private server for transferring stuff, my GT is AWoodinPickle. I'd be happy to help.
---
Again, he also said that they would only sell cosmetics. That kinda trumps the whole "did he mean only DLC or not" argument.
---
Is it cosmetic only? No?
---
Then it shouldn't be sold for real money, end of story. More storage space was such a constantly requested feature, putting a 100$/year paywall over a storage upgrade was nothing short of dirty.
---
You know, that's kinda supposed to be the reason why the Atom Shop prices are grossly inflated. 15$ skins were because everything else was supposed to be free. There is absolutely no reason why 76 needs that much monetization, going to the point of breaking promises (which they themselves admitted to with their "plans changed" letter before releasing 1st), when updates and new content drops are not only less frequent than in other live services, but also buggier and with much less content overall.
---
LOL, and they still haven't responded to my bug report.
---
Enemies can deal physical damage and energy damage (among others).  Physical damage, like bullets, is countered by Damage Resistance.  Energy damage, like laser shots, is countered by Energy Resistance.
---
Metal Armor has exceedingly good DR, but the trade-off is that it has lousy ER.  Leather is its polar opposite.  Things like Combat Armor offer a more balanced defense.
---
It negates the debuff. Every addiction works the same way.
---
For me it's that I end up in a completely different location, like other side of the map type issues.
---
PC as well, just started like at most a week ago.
---
Laser pistol beam splitter with a magic effect
---
I kinda figured It was role play but had to ask anyway. I used to do the PVP but I'm shit at it and always got my ass handed to me on a silver platter üòÇ  now I only attack if they pick a lock at my camp. I won't stay at workshops, to avoid the PVP, once I claim it for a daily challenge or something. That's the only way they can get me and I'm no dummy anymore üòÇüòÇ
---
European Consumer Laws are a blessing. good luck!
---
They aren't real common, I'm not sure but I believe there is a recipie for blood packs too, I may be wrong but I think they take tick blood sacs. It's been a really long time since I've crafted anything like this so I might be remembering wrong.
---
If I'm right, you might try looking for tick hoards, should be something like 10+ spawn. They aren't the most common hoards but they do show periodically.
---
I had never had the issue until about a week ago. It has been frequent since. It seems to let me then jump to somewhere else and on to my final destination. Pain in the ass though
---
Oh, the final level shows the metallic spaceman looking power armor paint.
---
I still get em and have them all learned also, I don't know for certain if the PA plans are like that tho. Last I remember you had to learn them in order to unlock the next. Initiate PA plan, pretty sure that's the one, was also removed and considered legacy.
---
Lead pipes are 2 for 1s.  They're one of the few weapons I always loot.
---
Goo for what ails ya!

Deathclaw Gauntlet all day long, unless you're a Power Armor toon.

Also, make certain your are very careful to select private world when heading back in to pickup your items
---
how did u know that he is bloodied? he tagged u and u shot him back with RP food build Archer¬¥s bow?  Anyway is someone has low hp and u killed him it is not a big deal. Not all teslas are BE teslas. And food build is something new to me.

I have gotten to the point where I have bought every plan available for caps from every vendor, including all the serum plans and power armor mod plans.  There is pretty much nothing left for me to spend caps on anymore, and I wind up just buying ammo or the occasional rare item from players to keep from going over the limit.  I don't even need Smiley's gold anymore, and that is only a weekly caps sink.  Once players reach that point, they'll be stashing or carrying all the good items on them, and trading for similar good items.  Thank bethesda for imposing a caps limit and not including an item for item trade function that doesn't rely on trusting randoms to not rip you off, or going outside the game to trade.  I put some decent rolls in my vendor, but I save all the really nice items for direct trades, since they are worth too much, I don't need the caps, and am always at 15-30k caps.
---
Heck ya man haha. Thos workshops is the way to go haha. I remebe always fighter of the ammo plant üòÇ
---
Cool idea!!  I‚Äôve never fought both at the same time.
---
One thing I do is if I don't get anything in two or three turn ins on same server I hop ship and try a different one. Sometimes get two or three turn ins in a row with extra rewards.
---
They've had problems with ash piles for nearly a decade and a half at this point (they were buggy in Oblivion and every game since).
---
Honestly they should just make Fallout 4 and 76 semi canon because they have retconned the original lore so much to the point that it's actually disrespectful. That way BGS has freedom to create whatever they want and they won't fuck up the other games in the process.
---
Simply talk to our friendly representative while on the server to begin the process! You'll LOVE the Packtray Difference [tm]!
---
It was the first thing I did when I purchased them.
---
Yeah wastelanders kinda killed vending I dont even bother with it much anymore because it seems like there's nothing in the vendors but mounted heads and scrip legendaries.
---
I haven't seen much worth buying in a while plus smiley has been robbing people on a regular basis so most casual and new players probably don't have the extra to spend these days
---
Omg same!  üñ§
---
Had this same thing at my camp for a good while lol, love it
---
Check the Responders vendor bot in the whitesprings resort. If they dont sell it, one of the others should along that strip.
---
if it happens during events it wasnt on purpose. Sometimes u r to close to our real targets and we want that xp :)
---
If you are her target, it will prevent her from landing, she will skip the landing mechanic.
---
Edit: wanted to clarify. She will skip the mechanic for that cycle,  she often replaces it with a swoop spam. That's how you know her primary target is out of reach, and has no pathing.
---
Edit 2: idk why people get on top of things when they're in their big suits of murder steel. 
---
I play stealth, I have around 375 DR, and when the queen does hit me, I take very little damage. Plus she never detects me.
---
I can't imagine your DR in a tin can, but I'm sure you'd survive just as well.
---
I am carrying like 77 plasma cores atm. And a shitload of ammo for my other heavy weapons lol. Could do all quests in the game without need to resupply.
---
I only claim them in my friends private server, I ain't got time for fighting players. I hated defending from players anyway üòÇ
---
Happened to me too.
---
Build a structure, put a Brahmin in it, shoot the Brahmin with the bloatfly syringer... make sure everyone gets hits on the blowflies with their syringers... endless bloatflies and legendaries spawning... do it in a blast zone and get masses and fluids
---
Nope, PC
---
It will be coming with update 21 next week. It was on the Bethesda‚Äôs site with a brief explanation of what they were going to change.
---
Ohhhhh well I'm the type of guy...
---
Camp placements should be allowed to be way closer. I couldn't have mine on a server, the persons camp was like 30ft away from where mine is. Stupid.
---
I fully agree with this. I even optimized my change to unarmed over two handed recently so I could minimize the defense lost. Not that it matters that much thanks to the formula for damage. 
---
I‚Äôd use it in a heartbeat. Though I do think unyielding giving +15 with all pieces is a bit much.
---
Well considering the massive amount of poor vs rich I think your math is wrong
---
Yeah, it's very misleading. It does not show the current reward when you go to level up with atoms. It only shows a picture of the level 100 bundle.
---
I too have been seeing less and less events each time I get on now. It‚Äôs frustrating!
---
It‚Äôs been pretty helpful, especially since I‚Äôm very indecisive lol
---
Normally it would be impossible to even think anything on the client is doing it.  Games just aren't designed that way, that the server is the slave of the client, and not the other way around.  But this game is such a steaming pile of shit it's not just not impossible to even think that, it's the first thing people are thinking.  That a client issue is causing this to complete.
---
Here's the thing though.  Any competent company would have had ANY completion reward SCORE, even if it's a bugged one.
---
The fact that auto-completing isn't rewarding SCORE is a level of incompetence that you wouldn't even expect from an elementary school programming course.
---
How fucked up does your system need to be that you aren't rewarding SCORE on completion?
---
Seriously.
---
Just how fucked up does your system need to be that you aren't rewarding SCORE on completion?
---
Any time I join a server I check the camps for who has the most plans for sale and visit the top 2 to 4.  I buy any plan I don't have that is a reasonable price, doesn't matter what it is. I don't mind the fast travel cost, as I don't use grenades and sell them all to the Wayward. Plus selling all the extra chems and booze there let's me keep up on the caps, even though I just hit the mid-40s for the first time.
---
The beam splitter is the magic effect?

A large Beebo.
---
I knew he was bloodied because his health was -20% before we started fight. No I shot him back with one bolt of my quad crossbow to initiate combat and finished him off with the rest. And for being a low health build? My main is a bloodied build and with proper damage mitigation you dont die easy (I never said it was a big deal, it's called a funny story because this guy thit it was gunna be easier) I never even said his Tesla was Explosive. All I said was tesla and his tesla was a regular tesla Explosive Teslas suck in pvp. And a food build is someone who isnt perked out for combat, has a lot of carry wait and food/chem making perks, so usually get dumpsterd and framed in pvp.
---
The amount of people I see trying to get me to pay 3+ caps per shotgun shell makes me sad.
---
I feel ya there, sometimes it's fun. But you can waist a lot of time pvping back and forth üòÇ

Whats a Bebo
---
I find very little events with "!" which indicate treasury notes.
---
Pain in the ass if you're trying to get gold quickly.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if nocturnal is a "rare" prefix because it's less useful, but the tougher events have a higher chance of awarding a "rare" prefix... lol
---
I'd be down for helping out with this. I'd easily be able to set up a nice spreadsheet somewhere for making sure people get back the junk they want to turn in, should they want to turn it in themselves too. My IGN is Kemphler and I'm on PC. I'll start putting the spreadsheet together once I'm off work. Has anyone made a Discord yet for this? Because if not, I'd be happy to get the ball rolling for one. I'm kinda garbage at actually setting bots and channels up for things though.
---
Supposed to be same as pails...
---
I didn‚Äôt buy anything. Read the post...
---
I‚Äôve noticed a lot of high level players, with a lot of inventory, just being lazy and selling everything for its ‚Äúsuggested price‚Äù.
---
Cigarette machines hold seemingly an infinite amount of whatever
---
Sold all my .308 for 3 caps a piece because the guy wanted to get rid of all his caps, made a fortune. Any other scenario ammo should be one cap.
---
It's broken.
---
Is that the default?
---
I know unless I am trying to be philanthropic or selling something I had to work to get, I often don't move the price  up or down on every thing I put on the machine
---
Esp when my shop has to be rebuilt because of placement issues on camp moving
---
I have purposely not learned any weapon plans other than Fixer on my alts in case Bethesda ever bugs the game so that this is true.
---
But currently it isn't.  Pool cues and golf clubs and rolling pins for everyone!
---
So you are running 2 accounts, as do I. I recommend it but not everyone has 2 computers that can run the game.
---
we definitely noticed that last night!  We were on for about 5 hours, no Breach &amp; Clear, Leader of the Pack, Back on the Beat, Violent Night, or Uranium Fever.  I think there was a Manhunt, a horde event, and a swarm of suitors.
---
I'm always changing my base sometimes after who ever moves I'll replace my base or store everything and start again in the same spot.   Currently I do indeed have a floater camp.. lol I just hit lvl 50 yesterday. üòÅ  But it works and I like it.  Also near the wayward. ü§∑

The only guaranteed way to get them is through the challenges. They do take a lot of time to complete, but Google can help you out with where to find certain things you need.

Buying the rights to use music from artists. Let alone studios that no longer exist is very difficult &amp; expensive. 
---
Best bet is wacking on Spotify. I use "fallout radio" it's got 300 songs from all the previous games. And some new additions that fit the atmosphere perfectly.
---
It's actually pretty solid.
---
Headless invincible enemies happens with no Ash or goo piles too!
---
No but it makes it shoot in a shotgun spread which, when combined with instigating, junkies, stalker, 50 limb,33 vats, or 15% block (armor). Makes it magical
---
They didn't fix Fallout 4 either!
---
I saw someone who was selling junk for 30k caps each, so
---
True, but there are ways to run the client in 2 sessions on the same PC, probably more as well. Something to do with having multiple copies of the game .exe and doing some ini-tweaking.
---
Ok thanks
---
If you say so
---
My 1st just expired. There was far more events in my private session. 
---
I'd be selling mole miner loot when notified that lode barring would be going off. 
---
Public lobby, maybe get an unattended radiation rumble and then sit around forever with nothing.
---
Oh nice! are you able to drop a link to it in here?
---
Edit: I found it on Spotify! Wasn‚Äôt hard at all to find thank you!
---
It feels like there has been less and less events each day. Thank god i have 100+ treasury notes from earlier.
---
I dont even grind for gold but i like to have fun with others by killing those legendaries again and again, but running around world without destination is becoming headless :D
---
People ground the events for them heavily and/or duped them, so probably just drop them on the ground, where I found them in bags.  I got more that way than from the actual events.
---
Magic effect triggers when you have too many damage numbers at once when using specific legendary rolls, like really high rate of fire heavy guns or things with multi shots going at once like shotguns or anything with a splitter.
---
They can have it once they claim it from me, I'll go elsewhere üòÇüòÇ
---
I'd love to see that happen
---
Because that‚Äôs how mafia works
---
Depends on the server. I've noticed laggy servers or servers that have been up a longtime rarely have public events but fresh servers or private servers have regular public events a few minutes after each one.
---
Greed.
---
Giving people 2400 more stash space would cost them Fallout 1st money.  Even if it would make the game more playable and enjoyable and ultimately retain more players and make them more money they won't see it that way.
---
And this is why Im excited every Tuesday. 
---
Only to mostly be kicked in the nuts by disappointment.
---
"Don't fuck with the wongs". If you know, you know
---
I used to have a furious exploding automatic pipe that I gave away
---
Cheap to run, cheap to repair, and in the low level areas all you need
---
yup, someone made a guide and posted it here long ago (if anyone else is interested) :-)
---
It wasnt an event, buddy haha. I was killing scorched in the bog and he started flowing me around with a tesla and MM gauntlet haha. I was agro as hell, my dude haha
---
it bothers me that so many people at this level dont know how to share cards
---
You can do it with a single powerfist.
---
If there is any evidence of someone else in the silo, sneaking or not I bail immediately. I don't like competition.
---
As far as I can see, all cases happen when there was a connection with NW.
---
Eg. all my friends who play NW have this happened to them, but those that stay away from NW never had a single challenge autocompleted.
---
Better go with . 50 cal. Stronger louder sound (who needs silencers anyway) and 0.50 cal easy to craft 180 per. And higher dmg too
---

Good move. Ghouls are terrified of railway cops

Flawless victory!

The Brotherhood of Steel demands your tribute, citizen. You will had over a portion of your scrap to the brotherhood.

Turn the giant bird pinned to the side of Seneca Rock into the Thunder Bird.

Mine does it at least once a week or so.
---
what are you guys smoking?  ANY npcs can be annoying in fallout because they repeat the same 2 or 3 dialogue again and again and again.  commander daguerre herself isnt that annoying, shes rather pleasant compared to raider punk.  holy cow i want to punch his face in.  whiny dorky voice, its like he never reached puberty.
---
actually settler wanderer is the most pleasant ally out of the group.
---
They'll beat you there and be waiting.  
---
Yes, unless you can sneak away or get high enough they can't path to you they will follow you to the station and open the door
---
To much work for bethesda, better make more fatman or dragon skins

Sure [here you go buddy](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4nSAYITQh4Nlzlc6Idjyi3?si=RPn4wwpoRDKsalF_H3yZOw).

33/25
---
Not the ones I've encountered :)
---
Just make sure you use something like a suitcase at a train station and you aren't dropping it on the ground in a bag, those can disappear sometimes.
---
Also although it's pretty safe there are rare instances of people losing things.  Like most people, I have done it a ton of times with no issues but it can go wrong on occasion.
---
well, in that case, I'll just avoid them altogether
---
I need to clear stash space lol im maxed out
---
Suitcases at all the train stations are where people drop plans off.
---
I usually drop lower level plans off at Charleston Station, since it's more likely to see lowlevel traffic.
---
Staggering is a lie.
---
I  could use them letters, too, if extra lying about !
---
How are there people still playing this barely functioning alpha test game with no endgame content?
---
Do the paints still drop from the quest? I‚Äôve been running it 2-3 times a day for about 2 months and still don‚Äôt have any of them
---
Thats the problem not having some sort of auction. Some people may have items you would gladly buy, but you never meet, because playing on different servers
---
Goo and ash piles should also not be able to float (i.e. dusting a flying scorchbeast spawns the dust pile far into the sky) or have shared loot. I‚Äôve lost many a legendary to floating ash pile or shared loot on a goo pile.
---
Excavator gives you 4x results when mining ore which can be handy.  It's fairly common for people to keep a set of Excavator on top of their 60/X/U/65/whatever.
---
for 5 cents a day, you can save this Wastelander some stash space.
---
I got tired of known plans, recipes, fascnat masks and mods taking up storage space. Sold it all for 1 cap a piece. I sleep better now :)
---
Id love like a smol deathclaw uwu
---
I can sympathize. After the mass dupe of presents, pails, legacy's, etc. they pretty much became a new currency of sorts. I don't participate in duping so I feel like I don't have any way of trading with players now because I don't 10k presents to offer.
---
Some of us are weathervanes, not boats.
---
Eat the rich
---
I literally do not sell anything higher than 10 caps. All my plans are 5 caps a piece, junk that I don't want is 5 caps a piece, and the ammo I don't want goes for 1 cap a piece. If you want it gone sell it for cheap and it's more likely to be gone
---
It's their servers.  A competent company would have had auto-completing challenges also give SCORE within an hour of hearing about the bug even if the fix for auto-completing took longer.
---
I did scorched earth as a level 23 with a bunch of level 300s carrying me, did enough damage to a legendary deathclaw scorchbeast and the scorchbeast queen to get rewards, even as a level 23 the rewards were underwhelming as HELL all of it was almost useless I say almost cuz the scrip helped me get better weapons later on, I wasn't expecting god tier one shot weapons but damn
---
Pipe pistol/rifles I just found out have cork too
---
25% faster fire rate is 25% higher dps
---
Do you know how many badges you get per challenge completion?
---
if you're at Whitespring, sprint as fast as you can to where the assaultrons and sentry bots hang out by the front door to the resort.  (Where you go inside to the all the stores).)
---
As long as you get one shot on the ghouls, you can let the robots kill them and still get the full XP.
---
If it‚Äôs in my inventory I‚Äôm sure I retrieved it, that‚Äôs why I said I can‚Äôt drop or stash it.
---
Each turret will tell you what level mobs it can defend against. There are perks to raise this. Although, its1 worth staying in the forrest next to water while at a lower level.
---
A truly fascinating story.
---
How to kill bloodied build:
---
\- Nerfing Adrenal Reaction
---
\- Nerfing Serendipity
---
\- Nerfing Unyielding
---
\- Nerfing Nerd Rage
---
Bloodied will probably reign king unless those three are changed, together.
---
my friend (non1st member) likes to play in my private world (even when im not playing).  sometimes i will log in for him and log out, he has 20minutes until he gets kicked.  not sure where you get 5min reset from?
---
but i do agree private world transfers are relatively safe but not guaranteed.  one time i had my private world reset on me during a transfer.  i must have used private game transfer 50-60 times (lost items only one time).  luckily i dont transfer anything worth high value.  anything valueable i transfer with my friend online.
---
I have two Xbox One consoles: a first generation one as my main console and another Xbox One S as a secondary. I have never experienced what you're describing... yet. I play Fallout 76 on both.
---
Every so often yes
---
&gt; "other"
---
Ffr = more dps on a commando weapon 
---
And the 50% more vats damage is second behind in terms of dps
---
It‚Äôs f#%‚Äôn stupid, it‚Äôs f#%‚Äôn dumb, &amp; it‚Äôs f#%‚Äôn beautiful my friend. -DJ‚ò†Ô∏è
---
Your logic is backwards. It's a % increase so the faster the base fire rate of the gun the more you get out of it. If a gun has 50 rate of fire and you add 25% it goes from 50 to 62.5 (50√ó1.25). If the gun has a fire rate of 150 and you add the 25% you get 187.5 (150√ó1.25).
---
Faster fire rate is the best increase to damage/second
---
you under estimate how much money youd get from taxing the rich
---
Should be able to just help newer players, feel good about it, and not have to come post about it. I've been doing this since level 20 üíÄ
---
I used to sell for one cap a piece. now it's free. I just dump it for free at train stations usually but this way maybe someone will def use it.
---
I do
---
nice. my goals.  melee is boring to me.
---
Yeah, but you could also argue that Fallout 4 (like Skyrim and Oblivion before it) was a finite project.  Once it was done, they moved on to something else.
---
76 doesn't really have that excuse because that's the tacit deal in a games-as-a-service platform.  If you want to keep throwing monetization at us, our expectation is that you will continue to work on the game.
---
To Austin's credit, they have fixed some long-standing problems.  You finally have to hold E to sit or drink so you can't do it accidentally anymore.  The Lever Action Rifle reloads correctly (most of the time, at least).  I'm sure there at least a few other examples that flew under the radar too.  These piles (which, to be fair, are being exacerbated by glitched LITS and don't come up *that* often otherwise) are just one of many things that probably deserve another look.
---
Hard disagree. If ypu dont kill anyone in nw its like you were never there. People want to fight in nw. Dieing is the expected outcome of nw 9 of 10  times.
---
Fallout 76 sure is a good game, but go play Fallout New Vegas
---
Any time someone has told me they're gonna nuke my camp. I stay until right before it drops, log out, then back in 2 minutes later on the same server.
---
"So howd that nuke go? My base seems fine to me"
---
Yes but it's laziness caused by the community fixing all of their games for them!
---
Junkies or vampire imo
---
I though gunsmith was broken right now, or was it fixed?
---
What all perks will make them stronger? I'm aware of home defense. Is there anything else?
---
No clue
---
Junkies, 2 shot, furious or vamp
---
Fuck the BoS. Enclave for the win.
---
^Yes, ^I ^will ^still ^give ^them ^their ^shit ^because ^it‚Äôs ^new ^content
---
I've done that before with some success. However, I was thinking maybe I could just kill them myself this time using the train station as refuge. But it sounds like that plan would fail big time.
---
Amazed about how what other people do with the game they have purchased pisses you off. Do you realize this has no impact over your game experience?  
---
Jesus Christ, stop whinning and enjoy the game
---
Many people. You can either remove the skin and rebuild or wait for a fix
---
I just leave a "You've been insulted!" note.
---
Maybe they'll get a clue....?
---
Don't think theres anymore.
---
It seems to be what most people are starting to say.
---
yeah i dont like melee so much. but ivr seen peole get crazy damage with it.   maybe next character
---
Honestly I‚Äôve had better luck being online when it resets. My auto-completes have always come when I‚Äôm not.
---
They could limit the percentage of non stackable items.  There are ways they could do it.  They just don't want to.
---
These are good tips, but this is a PURE workaround for bad handcuffing mechanics. This really only appeals to people who play this game full time. Casual players working 10 hours a day don't want to spend an extra hour of character hopping to store and maximize scrip. Nor do they have time to level 4 other characters.
---
Where‚Äôs your camp, Is it at one of the random npc spawns? I started a newer character and I‚Äôve only run into him once but he didn‚Äôt have the plans
---
Pretty sure it‚Äôs just the one
---
I am certainly going to do this next time haha
---
Eh, it‚Äôs not healthy to wish financial ruin on a company, especially over a video game
---
Thanks for the responses.  It's either a divine sign that I'm playing too much or I'm just hitting peak glitch.
---
As someone who exclusively uses gatling lasers, seeing this will now make me run ballistic weapons in farming zones
---
You deserve a fancy gold star sticker. Good job!

---
Oof. First time in this community and I get downvoted? Jeeze...
---
Never seen this before tbh. I sell all ammo for 1 cap
---
I swear if no one does the public event it doesn't spawn again as quick, but maybe that's just me
---
There are frustrated people everywhere. Recently I received some "I will find your adress" threats after refusing to trade a weapon. 
---
Some people need psychological assistance.
---
but did you get a nocturnal rolling pin?
---
Will do. :) I'm a huge multiplayer guy so that was the big draw for me on 76
---
Not sure why you're at Whitespring at level 33 anyway, but you do you bro.
---
I guess you're right
---
I got so many nocturnal rolling pins. Why tf do I keep getting rolling pins from 3 star enemies
---
Your done unless you nuke the prime site in the bottom corner to kill the sbq!!
---
Hey I sent you a friend request, let me know if you got it.
---
I usually do. I remember when I was modding hunting rifles for lower level players. Idk just felt like posting about it. Maybe I‚Äôm having a shitty day and helping someone put me in a good mood
---
economy has been ruined since last year
---
I use both. Deathclaw is for when I use sneak without PA. Super Sledge is for when I use Power Armour. 
---
I apologise for my bad English.
---
I just recommended [this](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4nSAYITQh4Nlzlc6Idjyi3?si=RPn4wwpoRDKsalF_H3yZOw) Spotify playlists to another chap. Got all of the previous game songs + some.
---
Saw that on Decoys Dungeon a few weeks ago. Fun ideas
---
Two shot or vamps imo
---
Back in the day, that's how I got my level-ups. I would get on top of the garage (before having marsupial) at WS and tag anything I could lol I would steer them to the WS bots or higher level players would kill them. This was when all the ghouls - enemies were high-level none of the low level 9 "rebalancing" ghouls. I still remember being slapped to death by my first level 62 charred ghoul lol
---
alright showoff! stop making us rolling pinless peons feel bad
---
It's pretty nuts, especially since the damage output of most energy weapons is nothing to write home about, which was supposed to be our benefit in this deal.  Lower durability, but more damage, is usually how it goes.  Low durability and low damage equals a weapon that we're constantly having to repair.
---
I killed the sbq in an event with someone else‚Äôs nuke a while ago. I think that counts
---
2400? Even just say 200 would allow you to transfer plenty
---
Yeah nah its weird, I rarely see more events than 3 at a time, i used to see loads, and after I completed one or two there was a new one shortly later, very weird
---
The day I transferred all my great weapons to free up space for my vendors. I was sweating freaking bullets with fear.
---
Why do people always think they're the "first" to have an opinion or experience an issue?
---
Let's be honest, we all tried to sell things for their "sale value" at some point because we had no idea there was a 30k cap limit and just thought high leveled players were carrying millions on them.
---
Just wait for someone else to launch it? 
---
If it was changed like how you're suggesting, to reward better, then noone would ever want to do it because they got the good stuff a lot more easily, and they'd get bored faster
---
Prefix doesn't matter when you have +33% vats hit chance.  You don't need to use vats either.  Make sure you get the tri barrel though, as it's the most economical one.
---
They want survival back
---
Both would lose the same amount to DR.
---
I think you're hitting two different limbs, and getting different multipliers as a result.
---
Shoot a sandbag, because those will show damage numbers without DR/ER or limb multipliers
---
I have 2* Bloodied Hunting rifle that I'd trade for a Bloodied Lever rifle, if you are interested. Cheers.
---
Not until OP bites someone‚Äôs throat out
---
I'm not even trying to sell missiles/nukes anymore because they're killing my storage capacity. I just dump them on the floor ... which would be a shame in any other FO game. :c
---
Yes, i received the Paladin paint yesterday. Only missing the Elder paint now. But it's a very long and boring grind...
---
It turns it into a quasi-shotgun, which then behaves in the same way that "magic" shotguns do (i.e. each beam is doing the Pip-Boy stated damage).
---
Yes, I forgot about this one.
---
Farmed the dailys for about 90 badges , time consuming but easy
---
The only ammo I sell more than 1 cap is Alien Blaster rounds. I sell them for 2 caps because you can only get it in one place, at least to my knowledge.
---
The way you wrote the title made me think the story would end badly.
---
Oh god I‚Äôve only had to re-select one spot like 3 times max, almost always just 2 if it‚Äôs acting up.
---
I think that is only the case if they are automatics, but I could be wrong.
---
Indeed
---
Ah yes, there was a sale. It's over now. Don't know when it's happening again.
---
I finished my reputation grinds and I‚Äôve never heard of this before. Where are they located?
---
Very true! The other night, I made an alt for the first time. It was getting late and I just wanted to complete my Level Up challenge. I pulled up the map and thought ‚ÄúHmm, it looks so different.‚Äù and then I realized that‚Äôs because I hadn‚Äôt discovered any places yet, haha!
---
I had another lightbulb moment when I logged in on my alt and tried to do the buy 3 things challenge. *Walks to nearby camp, thinks maybe I can buy a low level gun.* lolz I have 10 caps! 
---
And then I took my alt to a nuclear winter match. I realized, no Grafton Dam mermaid here!
---
It was fun, lol. My main is a glutton rolling around in fast travel, too many caps, and being able to hide in the water during Nuclear Winter. It was nice to get back to basics for a while. 
---
Also, I recommend that all pre-Wastelanders players make an alt now. It‚Äôs a different flow right out of the vault because of Wastelanders, and there are new dialogue options! Very refreshing.
---
Rifleman
---
I don‚Äôt think I played when that was a thing. What was survival?
---
Because thats the Default value. They dont wanna spend time changing the price tags
---
not sure what your issue could be. All I could say is make sure you do the above stuff, make sure you add it to the archive list in the `Project76Custom.ini` file, make sure you don't have any conflicts anywhere from different mods that edit the same file. 
---
if you can't get it to work then I'd say try https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/546 out which is a quick config / mod manager and has been updated to include the Game Pass Version.
---
Also make sure you enable mod support as well from the xbox app by going to the fallout 76 page and clicking the 3 dots and clicking enable mods otherwise mods just won't work no matter what you do.
---
I didn't like melee much either but then the RNG gods basically said "No, you're melee now" and since then, I've had two powerfists, a deathclaw gauntlet, and a super sledge that has made me a believer. Good luck in your adventure!
---
Pic #5 - "Oh..  Shit"
---
I get this every now &amp; then,I usually chalk it up to the power box on the cord jammy ‚Äúoverheating‚Äù,&amp; I can‚Äôt hear it whining before it does cause of my headphones.
---
My Xbox Is maaaad old too though,so I dunno.
---
But it‚Äôs def happened from time to time.
---
I didn't know that! Thank you!  I'll be adding it to my rotation.
---
All mentats share the mentats addiction.
---
The faster you shoot the more dps you put out.
---
Pvp is part of the game.
---
Aaaaaaaye!
---
Thank you
---
She is located at Ohio River Adventures, on the west side of the map. It's on the river, you can't miss it.
---
You can't actually do any damage to anyone unless they shoot back though, right?
---
Cheers!
---
So they play a super grindy game for hours on end, sinking hundreds if not thousands of hours into it, yet cannot click two buttons to change a number on the screen? That is what you are saying?
---
(I use the ammo converter)
---
Agility category Home defense perk allows you to craft stronger turrets. However, there isnt anything you can equip to make turrets stronger than that unfortunately. Just placement with the right turret type. Welcome to the game, hope you're having fun
---
Survival was completely open pvp. Didnt have to shoot back or anything to initiate it. Just fully open. However they made it so you could only fast travel to 76, camp, and train stations. Naturally people were constantly camping the stations and spawn killing the people that travel. It was added as a beta and taken down, I'm guessing to work on a better travel system. But that was a year ago
---
Edit: also dropped aid items on death
---
I was wondering the very same thing just the other night...I thought maybe it was just me. Glad to know others noticed it...not so glad it's happening at all though.
---
I actually gained more respect for him for this. Not that I didn‚Äôt like him or anything before, he‚Äôs funny and all, but finding out he voiced Mort was like, ‚Äúdude, fuck yeah‚Äù.
---
thanks.  It's just so much funner shooting a bunch of lead
---
there is a truth in ur words bcz a lot of times I could get her attention while I was on the ground and every time she landed in a sec to fight me. It worked like 30-40 times at least. Speaking of being on top of ST we tried to fight her without getting down and she landed. One time she landed like in 10-15 seconds. The only difference was her time on the ground and it is quite shorter (not insta take off). Maybe it is all about searching for a spot where she can land and if there are few ST with forbidden to land area she just skip it.
---
Sounds awful. And from what I can tell it‚Äôs shelved permanently because of the costs. Concentrating on adventure and NW.
---
I‚Äôve never found anything in that suitcase. Morgantown‚Äôs, however, I have found several fusion cores within.
---
I was attending a public event nearby (Uranium Fever) and walked to the train station to stash some goods . I was too heavy.
---
Not sure, picked them up off scorched
---
Did you change your C.A.M.P. skin to the red one you get as a reward for legendary run? If so, thats the issue. Its a known bug and pretty frustrating. Only fix is dismantle and change skin back to default and rebuild
---
Huh. Good to know.    
---
However over the past month I can't remember how many times I've killed one only for it to ragdoll and glitch out of the game world. Can't use PC offline Fallout cheats to go after it.
---
True, but with their limitations they added, I don't gotta worry about it and I'm not forced to do so
---
Because greed...there will always be people who's greed outweighs common sense.
---
Alas, if only we were all as enlightened as you are and didn't like a little ego boost from other people once in a while! 
---
But then you came here specifically to brag about all the good deeds you've done so I guess you're just like the rest of us after all.  ;)
---
Yes they are safe
---
It's really common to come across good people like that in this game.
---
cause the ones that only add a paint instead of a whole new model are dedicated to that certain type of power armor (woodland being all the basic T-series power armor)
---
Honestly it was a fun mode to play until you needed to be on the other side of the map for any reason.
---
I'd like to know that too.
---
It kind of annoys me to be honest.  I wish pacifist mode was hou cant deal or take damage to/from other players and there was an icon by your name, otherwise full weapon damage.
---
I‚Äôm like you. I am devastated because the only time I ‚Äúgot‚Äù two kills in the game, it crashed as I was downing the second guy! üò≠
---
For a month?
---
And if u die u respawn where u get instantly killed by campers.
---
Both are god rolls in my opinion, and both fills different purposes.  
---
You want 33% to farm. West Tek, Whitesprings. You are one shotting them anyway, at least this way you are saving ammo and the satisfaction of 1 tapping everything  
---
25% is your boss killer. You only need DPS increase on Bosses, so this is the weapon of choice i'd say. Can still be used to farm but a little bit less ammo effective.  
---
3rd roll is really good, but you can work around without it.
---
If it was just Unyielding by itself it wouldn't be so bad. It would be a risk/reward situation. How low do you want to risk your health for a bonus? Which is probably how they saw it when they designed the legendary effect. But combine it with Serendipity and Nerd Rage, plus other damage avoidance perks and the risk mostly goes away. Instead of it being dangerous to run with such a low health, you actually become much tankier with it. Plus all the damage effect and other bonuses from Unyielding, Bloodied, Nerd Rage means your also do a ton more damage at low health. Individually it doesn't seem like much, but all together it becomes the unbeatable meta.
---
The exp gain from INT is probably the most unfair aspect, as damage output isn't unfair when it's mostly a PvE game (except for when e.g. the SBQ is melted too quickly). The Unyielding should have been split, like more STR for high health and more AGI for low health, and keep Bloodied, Nerd Rage and Adrenal Reaction so that Bloodied still has the highest dmg output but not the increased carry weight and exp gain. Cause low health high damage makes sense, as much as high health and makes you output more damage over time without risking dying
---
Oh ok I didn't realize there were skins that changed the whole look of armor
---
Thanks! I‚Äôve been looking forward to using them!
---
I‚Äôll go take a look. It doesn‚Äôt help me know I guess but to lessen the rep grind next time this will be useful.
---
Seems like the SBQ has become an ammo sponge. I‚Äôve gotten so I shoot her a few times and then deal with other critters unless I can get elevated. Not worth the ammo until near the end
---
No we dont. We want a better mode. Open fast travel, no leaderboards, no bplayers on map.
---
There is nothing better. Explosive is a meme and 33% is no good for a boss since you will be 95% VATS after a couple shots
---
Not
---
Going to fix the exploding versions which are the ones that break really fast I believe
---
Woot woot I own a Tiguan lol. I guess that makes me basic tho :/
---
theres a couple. liberty prime one for example can be applied to the ultracite
---
It's not a level. It's an amount of xp earned. It think it was like 14000 xp or something very close to that.
---
Then you might as well... you know.. run at 50% hp
---
Not true.  I've heard several stories of people who haven't played nw have it happen to them.
---
Crap, yes I did. Thanks!  Any word on if patch 21 will address this or not?
---
Oh I can't hurt anyone and they can't do anything to me but it's helpful for events, I can still be killed in a workshop though or by NPCs. If I wanted to fight players I'd do Nuclear Winter but I'm not worried, it was a lot more PVP friendly back near release, people could knock your health down without fighting back. The beta was terrible at times
---
Sorry, I read the post, except for the first line apparently :))).
---
I know, I have mentioned this numerous times but nothing has changed, now if it was a defective lightbulb that would be a different kettle of fish.
---
It happens. But with the camera, you will quickly know if the corpse is around or not so you won't waste minutes to look around for nothing.
---
I've just used this technic at Encrypted when the sheepsquatch just exploded and flew around nowhere to be found. Everybody was looking around for it. I went on a high ground, scan with the camera, took me few seconds to find it hidden in a bush.
---
But... levels are based on XP? 
---
So 14,000 XP = x level?? 
---
Jesus, please give us some Enclave-related stuff first.
---
Many new players prefer running full health all the way to atleast level 100+, there are simply more important aspects to the game until the true endgame where the bonuses of unyielding matters
---
not sure what you're getting at, but whatever
---
Yeah they break crazzyyy fast, rip
---
I want to kill people without their permission in a "survival" game, not a battle royale.
---
It‚Äôs 14k and unfortunately they are locked behind an invisible wall, so you‚Äôll unlock them when they unlock.
---
Once you get the nuclear winter beanie you‚Äôre close.
---
The fur lined coat is a bitch to get. I unlocked em all during double xp weekend. Was a grind.
---
Yep. That's about how mine went. I was really confused that it was giving a server error rather than the game just not letting me move back there like if a terminal or something were blocked
---
Some people sell the backpack mod for around 15k caps.  Just check venders for high level players. Bet you will find someone selling it.
---
It's a shame. I love the Southern Belle Motel area. It's sad to see a franchise ignore a large part of it's clientele base. You're getting a 3/5 on Melp from me.
---
On a different note.
---
Come to the Watoga Slocum's Joe! At the Watoga Slocum's Joe, we had a joint partnership with Red Rocket Gas Stations to make the best place to get a nice brew! Come get that power armor tuned up while you enjoy a good Cup-o-Joe. At the Watoga Slocum's Joe you'll come for the Joe and stay for the atmosphere we have hand crafted.
---
Just outside of Watoga and travel north! We can't wait to see you there!
---
Only on select PS4 servers
---
I have seen that data as well, the 14,000 XP, but I assumed that would translate to a level
---
Yep. Don‚Äôt exist as drops so they‚Äôre not going to do anything about them. Especially after the dupe. I‚Äôve tried a couple out and now they sit on a display rack collecting dust.
---
Obviously that too but as i said the BOS i almost here and i would like to be a part of this but at the same time i don't want to scrip my full unyielding ss set..
---
how new could he have been if he had full set of marine armor and multiple 3\* weapons?
---
I destroy peoples camps for that crap.
---
Yup. The sadness
---
I know....but the Enclave‚Äôs been treated like a red-headed step-child.
---
[Check out the Fortifying Atlas:Project Bravo section](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/19lD84ailufdG6cgVdqls2/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-fortifying-atlas-and-quakecon-details)
---
Makes me excited for the PS5. Most PS4 games will look and play much better.
---
So are most guns that people dream of. If your attitude is to avoid dupes then you should probably not trade.
---
I sell everything for a cap except Cryo cells. I sell them for 2, but I used to run a cryolator and even 3 caps is a deal. Just explosive bait their base.
---
True..i really hope that the next big update is going to be about the enclave
---
Well hopefully it‚Äôll get fixed soon
---
Just happened to me..... again! This is so stupid....
---
grats. Fallout 3 makes me want that bb gun. Just for reasons. 
---
and the pint sized slasher fun time adventure mode... c'mon nukashine, gimme a bonus level
---
I need a lot more material for my Enclave novel.
---
I use the camera at the queen event. sometimes during the heat of battle when we kill five or six enemies it's good to be able to find them. Hopefully, the flies will show up sooner or later they're more or less like a marker.
---
Level is not dependant. Each level reward unlocks independent of each other. Not 14000k total, but each are x amount of xp to unlock then starts over per reward level. Each overseer level increases the amount of xp needed per overseer level. What I do is up up a calculator and subtract how much do I gain per match and voila... Tracking reward xp not level xp.
---
Great stuff, honestly a big thank you! I‚Äôll do some farming tomorrow and send you a pm on here to set up a drop off time and the amount of mats. Till then, take it easy mate!
---
It‚Äôs not a big part, but the guy below me has a point. At endgame a large portion of the player base joins discord factions for fights or just fight within friend groups. A friend of mine organizes a fight club, he has an arena an every couple days they meet and duke it out. I don‚Äôt really fare well though: again, one-shotted.
---
You are correct, sir. He was shooting me, following me around (no doing any damage). So I ADS''ed, shot him ones and the Vats'ed on his head and shot him a few times. Gotta love concentrate fire haha
---
You are not alone my friend, it happens to me all the time.
---
Can't say I've seen those stories. I also can only go from what my friends reported.
---
Those who have never played NW have not yet had a single challenge autocompleted.
---
Even with thousands of shotguns shells I'll go around and buy some from vendors and some dude had kahunas the size of coconuts selling one shell for 25 caps.
---
I was just thinking the same thing. I just throw them on the ground.
---
Ok so I need to go change some prices.....Wasn't intentionally trying to gouge but I usually just list everything I put in my machines for whatever the game sets it at......
---
I don‚Äôt have the link with me on mobile mate, but just Google the latest issue of Inside the Vault. It‚Äôs got a compact rundown of the upcoming event.
---
I don't wanna kill anyone, I wanna help them more than anything. There's enough things to kill them as it is, I'm not adding to that stress üòÇ
---
Damn..
---
Sometimes I'll build like a crap ton of porta pottys everywhere and hide in one lol
---
Alternatively to the plain hazmat suit, there is the prototype suit for tracking unknown quest and the emmet mountain version which is a rare drop from radiation rumble.
---
I‚Äôm up to 400 pages.
---
The purpose of high health is to deal weaker, but sustained damage over time. It's less DPS, but that's how classes work
---
Most of my hits are centre of mass or headshots: laser rifles and lever actions have solid hip fire accuracy even with the TS accuracy debuff, which is why I use them.
---
so dont buy it. someone else will.
---
Queen mirelurk meat gets you the most rep points each day. It's not much, but every little bit helps.
---
I literally just unlocked the skeleton outfit!!! Omg üòÖüòÖ whew
---
I'm just waiting for them to come out with a bushwookie player icon. Could simply be Fallout Boy sticking his head out of some tall grass or bushes. I'd buy that.
---
Completely agree with you. Especially to farm SCORE there is no better way, nothing can compete with +12 int when its so core for the 100 pts / 10k. Just removing the exp gain with int / replacing it with something else would make it way more balanced.
---
bloodied build means bloodied weapon. I go with every weapon at low hp bcz of perks and a mutation which gives me +damage. While using PA ur chances to survive are equal thanks to emergency protocols so there is no need to go at full hp if u have EP.
---
I understood about food build. U maybe know better than me what sucks what doesnt. I meant that he could use any tesla not overpowered one.
---
lol I sell missile for 1 cap a piece
---
So I was pretty close üòÇ thanks for everyone's input though!
---
Damn!! That's a lot!
---
I tried logging in at Morgantown Airport. Maybe it‚Äôs unrelated, but it is running smoother!
---
This is where those FO1st players gonna be shining.
---
Yea there are some pricks on here, happens to everybody, I wouldn‚Äôt  pay any mind to em
---
My camp is themed as a gun shop. It's loaded with gun displays. I always leave all my extra ammo in a loot bag on the counter at the front of the shop right by the door where you can't miss it. I've left thousands of .556, .45,  10mm, and shotgun shells, plus the same of all the types nobody wants (.38, .44, arrows, syringer, railroad spikes, crossbow bolts, missiles a mini nukes, 40 grenade rounds.... Basically everything but what I use. For free.
---
Very true, although the game needs at this point much more content, at least 10 more public events, 20ish normal events, another region and more small things
---
Was there one for the settlers I also seemed to miss completely?
---
I did year one - reclamation. Year two is Wastelanders....I am up to starting the Vault 79 quest lines, with the Overseer helping Foundation, while the Enclave is helping the Raiders.
---
Oh, and they put together a special squad to take down the Blood Eagles with Beckett.
---
We're gonna build a Brotherhood settlement!

---
I duped a whole bunch of ultra cite ammo so I don‚Äôt need to worry about it until the next fallout
---
I see, thank you. For me, I think, since I only started playing NW when these items became available, that's why I was confused about the amt of XP required because I was associating it with the level since I started at 0. I understand now though
---
That's really cool!
---
Fix the ammo converter? Top fkn kek
---
Holy jeez....what is it.. 8 badges for a backpack mod lol...
---
Oh nice thanks, looks like I'm donating my leather which is great.
---
I assume they made those numbers easily attainable would be super disappointing for everyone otherwise lol
---
If you‚Äôre interested, I can post links to the drafts.
---
I like the fact you like the fact he likes it
---
no shit?i bet it looks like a dump tho
---
I‚Äôve been farming those but 9 times out of 10 no badges....
---
Almost all ammo on any platform is 1 cap. As it should be lol.
---
Lol yeah but usually people dont want to search through all of the chaos if your in the city on a map and it's full of people you just have to work fast placing them
---
Yeah I‚Äôve been vendor hopping looking for backpack mods because I don‚Äôt have time for the challenges and I really want it.  So far haven‚Äôt run across anyone selling it
---
I have so much fun doing stuff like this. Today I hid in the plane cabin at Morgantown airport. I covered the doorway with large paintings so it looked boarded up.
---
I farm the two repeatable quests.  If you go to Huntersville and loot all the meat bags, you can get most of the insect parts that you need for Stings Wings and things.
---
by pleasant valley
---
Cork seems to be the only one that legitimate players would struggle with, but it seems general consensus is that dupers will make them all easy to complete.
---
ok ok. didnt read well but I had a similar issue (it wasnt in my inventory though). R u sure u can remove this quest? I did it with dailies I dont like.
---
Do you ever sell nukes or missiles. I drop them on the floor lol
---
Oof
---
That's really smart I wonder if the long display boards would work also since they snap?
---
Lol, I didn't down vote you no worries.
---
Yesterday during uranium fever, I tagged a legendary, waved everyone over for a shot and got out of the way.... came back it was gone.  I think it sunk into one of the rock piles because I could see flies hovering but I couldn‚Äôt collect no matter what I did.
---
Well a bloodied build means you have all your perks and gear Meta'ed to having low health. A bloodied weapon is just a weapon that get more damage with low health. My main is a Bloodied PA Heavy, I am well versed in the beauty of emergency protocol. I'm not looking for education on a bloodied build, my good sir haha. All I know is that his health was set for max bloodied damage. Because at 20% or less you get a 100% damage modifier on Bloodied weapons. And for the Tesla, in your first comment you said "BE" which usually means Bloodied Explosive, his was non-legacy.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve been doing the repeatable quests.... but I would say out of the last 5 stings and things I‚Äôve done... zero badges.  Same for the rest
---
Have you tried events. I went to defiance and before I could barely finish asking, a level 400 something launched himself into air off launcher and let me revive him then gave me thumbs up. There will be someone decent at an event who knows how hard this challenge is to get soloing
---
Not that i heard of but they  got a mess of visual glitches and armors to fix along with the C.A.M.P. Skin, so most likely it would. And thats just with The Legendary Run, But we'll have to see
---
I‚Äôm person 2, I‚Äôll give them my supplies so long as they deal with those damn super mutant suiciders. I hate them with every fiber in my being.
---
It‚Äôs awful. Sometimes it won‚Äôt work at all and I have to leave the server. Definitely kills my desire to play.
---
For me it depends on the day. 1 cap if I‚Äôm feeling greedy and 0 if I‚Äôm feeling generous. Usually zero on the more useful ammo types for lower levels tho
---
When do you check on him.
---
Try about 9pm EST on Saturday.  He resets at 8pm and within first 24 hours seems fine,  beyond that, well, you get what you‚Äôve been getting.
---
Lol.... I refuse to trade with people on the spot... always seems sketchy to me...
---
Right before this I was playing a lot of Overwatch.  You'd think with the funny toons you play in that game that people wouldn't take it super seriously.  I was so very wrong. I played CoD:MWF for a while as well.  That was beyond nuts.  I was blown away by the verbal abuse and racist/sexist commentary.
---
Then I came back to FO76.  So much love and support in this game.  What a breath of fresh air.  Cheers to all of you for making this an amazing community.
---
I‚Äôve had a ghoul follow me into a train station before
---
Unless their missiles cartidges or 40mm i always used to charge 1 per round but honestly with the addition of the ammo converter i kinda just hoard my ammo to turn in to .45s for my lever action.
---
Good on you!
---
So much for that theory. I'll just shoot and run.
---
You forgot type 4. namely there going to try and steal my stuf anyway so either drop it all n a fissure sight and give them the address or give em eveything and led god sort it out.....and if the last confused you.... then this Mamet realy meeds a junk jet gun.
---
and through hiker, carry all the food.  Batteries Included, carry all the fusions cores and energy ammo.
---
I carry all the things!  I'm usually heading out with about 160 lbs on me, and when I say I have all the ammo, I have ALL the ammo.
---
Since this weekend it sure seems that way..
---
I had this happen too.  Not for that long but there was a period where he wouldn't give gold or wouldn't let me buy the maximum.
---
Go talk to Duchess and trade with her.  Doesn't matter what.  Someone recommended that to me on this sub and it worked. I have no idea why.
---
the concept of time, but whatever
---
Gonna say no for the same reason you said in the post. It's too lore breaking. SS had all that stuff in a bunker. The brotherhood was formed in the open world, they wouldnt have access to that armor to be able to mod it. If anyone had access to it besides the SS, itd be the enclave
---
Can be fixed by, next time you join server speaking to the Duchess first, then speak to Smiley, he'll sell then :-)
---
You did enclave quest line?
---
Ok semi-noob here.  I hear the term ‚Äúfood build‚Äù being tossed around quite frequently.  What exactly is that?
---
And it‚Äôs shockingly easy to mass dupe scrap if you have fallout first.
---
granted only specific scrap.
---
Oh dearest Ed-E, be silent my weeping heart.
---
Skins change the model, so they can go on anything. Paint is type specific. They tell you what it can go on before you buy it
---
Yep, I think so. That's how I got mine at least
---
Yeah i did the same went into their HQ and killed them all! I walked in the center of the place  and said this is for the Institute killed everyone around, then i did the same to the Railroad..lol
---
idk haven‚Äôt gotten on in almost a month and i‚Äôm scared to even open it up. 
---
I don‚Äôt want to be disappointed but yet i know i will
---
Your health is not a class nor are you stuck in any particular class at any point.  Nor does high hp have much impact on damage output when every mobs dies instantly anyway, and even the sbq can be deleted using readily available magic weapons.  Your attempt at an argument fails before it starts.
---
Melee build I take it?
---
I did some inventory cleaning last time and it's happening less frequently since I dumped all those holotapes I had gathered ... might also just be a co√Øncidence.
---
Big foot!
---
Very cool, you totally nailed the retro suburban backyard aesthetic!  The only problem I can think of with this camp is that I've been seeing more and more people setting up at Seneca Rocks lately, so I feel like it would involve more server jumping to load it into the world
---
How long do items last? I figure unless a server crashes or goes offline for maintenance there is always atleast one person on the server to keep the clock going so the items should be finite, correct? I never thought about leaving stuff in them as I figured stuff just *poof* disappeared when "I" left the server.
---
And Runaround Sue either Dion or Del Shannon!
---
Haven‚Äôt gotten to play yet sadly, have to get on around 8 or 9 to do dailies but otherwise days been ok. I like my camp but somedays I wish I could keep building stuff.
---
I feel like this community is just Canadians. Never seen so many people apologize for killing other players in a PVP game in my life.
---
Pretty sure I got all my Flamer mods from scrapping them.
---
If you can craft them, don‚Äôt forget to use Super Duper for a chance to craft 2 for the cost of 1.
---
4 heavy machine gun turrets will mow down the strongest of enemies.
---
Yup. When they first added suiciders to the game I went to West-Tek to grind some experience, I opened the gate and ran forward to get a good hit but the second I heard the tell-tale beeping I started hightailing it out of there.
---
Oh yeah, I wish that too.
---
It's just a character who is not spec'ed fully for combat or pvp. Usually with lots of weight reduction perks, drinking and eating perks. They unfortunately usually get farmed by people attacking there workshops or make the mistake of shooting back at a greifer who is all spec'ed for combat üôÇ
---
I love this idea but i dont think the game can handle it. I was thinking about radstorms about a week ago and relised i hadnt seen one in a while. Few days later and i was in one, but the weird thing is it seemed alot less intense than i remeber. Like i used to make sure my camps were sealed just to escape them sometimes. So i think they got "nerfed" on the amount of chaos then ensue. If they had to dumb them down i doubt they could handle a hoard roaming with it. It would be cool though. We could get it initiated by restoring a doppler center and then once you do that the event bcomes available to start like riding shotgun where you go talk to the weather man and he tells you where to go for the event.
---
Thanks man, gonna listen later while playing. Cool stuff.
---
or join a building team and get bonus xp for everything you kill
---
consider it done
---
Here‚Äôs my day. Set up at Poseidon workshop. Built some defenses, resources, crops .made a lil hostel for travelers. Even fixed the power station. About 40 mins setting up a workshopLeave Poseidon to adventure and immediately booted off server. Since then kicked off of server 5 more time. Each taking like 5 min to find a world where my camp will spawn.
---
Oh, gotcha that makes sense
---
I sell all my ammo for 1 cap, except mini nukes for 2 caps. Ultracite usually goes for 3-4 caps. Bundles or bulk orders have special offers.
---
The Wayward is trying to promote corporate synergy.
---
They should make Tetanus a disease, it would makes sense right? 
---
Unless the vault dwellers are all vaccinated against tetanus then it wouldn't probably make sense.
---
There's a stockpile of working nuclear vehicles in Mint condition underground I saw on a quest.
---
 Give us vehicles!
---
Ooh, I really like that agitator idea. I have ZERO faith that it would actually work properly, but it's a cool idea.  I know some of my friends like to run around with stuff like vampires buzzblades, power armor and defensive perks to tank hordes of mobs and bring them all to one spot for the whole group to get lots of xp.  Something that makes a lot of noise to attract them would be cool.  Maybe a mod for a power armor arm?
---
31, Just got it a couple days ago
---
I was one of the folk who got the nylon bags and participated in the betas. After being quite disappointed in the state of the game I just left.. came back a couple of months ago because my dad was talking about how much he loved it, said the game was really good now, so now I'm downloading it, get onto it and woah it was so overwhelming but I really enjoyed it. I'm level 200 now and can't get enough of it!!
---
Oh you sweet little naive thing
---
fallout 1st is a subscription service which gives you a box you can store an infinite amount of scrap in. A private server for you and some pals. And a survival tent you can move around. I have it but i am cancelling before it takes my 4th month. I have enough scrap to last me a year. if not more.
---
And the brotherhood of steel are coming to atlas soon
---
Legendary Effect (Armour): Bastion
---
-Resist damage equal to 2% of your max HP.
---
For example, equipping one piece of Bastion armour with 300 max HP would give you 6% damage resistance. Stacks with other Bastion, scales with effects that modify max HP.
---
at least on ps4 they are not even the same texture quality, as i buy it the shadown prime and his hand is extremely low detail and the black/greenwish is like blurry on most places.
---
Bethesda: No, have this PA skin instead.
---
Too bad we cant write notes and leave them around. 
---
I mean... I'm sure there would be many heinous things written for anyone to find, but also I'm used to that. I use public restrooms. 
---
I vote for wasteland notes.
---
I‚Äôm at and orgy all weekend so can‚Äôt play.
---
There are new players who wont have them.
---
I disagree completely.  My fondest memories of this game were exploring and finding bits and pieces of what happened.  Piecing together the timeline of what happened, and searching beyond hope for any signs of life.
---
I remember when I first realized that if the Responders, Brotherhood, and Free States would have just worked together they would've won.  How if Charleston would have just at least tried to help the survivors in the Divide then the raiders might never have formed.  Realized that the entirety of the post-war problems are essentially the Enclave's fault.
---
We were never told any of that.  Having an NPC bable it into my face means nothing.  I barely know where the Foundation people are from.  The Raiders at least I have a connection to, from finding all the logs at the Temple where the Diehards lived.
---
Yeah, a lot of People like this region. It can be pretty anyoing.
---
If someone places something in a container can someone else accses it?
---
I don't know if events are triggered in any way outside of like riding shotgun, scorched earth etc where you have a cool down and DO activate it yourself or from someone else but I feel like if a player is in an area the events will pop up more frequently so if you find a server that is fairly active then you should see more events. If it is low level players in one area questing you may not see many events. I swear I can log on and not have a single event for some time and others I am hopping into events with 4 other people consistently and the events pop up so frequently that I have to rush the one I am in or actually choose which one to go to. Am I crazy?
---
Ooh ooh and free player icons.
---
as a Wisconsinite, i'd love to see a Hodag. but West Virginia and Wisconsin are quite far from each other, so it'd make no sense, even for a mutant named after it like the snallygasters and grafton monsters. 
---
maybe for a future game i'll get my
---
Aside from using Home Defense to build better turrets, you could also build an artillery platform that adds about 10 defense (IIRC) to your camp. Not quite sure if it really helps keep mobs away (I‚Äôm even inclined to think it is a sort of leftover stat from FO4), but can‚Äôt hurt trying, can it?
---
Other than that, get an ally NPC, who will stay at your CAMP and help defend it (though not very efficiently).
---
Lastly, the most complicated one of the bunch is getting a pet: basically you need to tame a creature using the animal friend perk (also wasteland whisperer in some cases). I would suggest looking for a more detailed guide since there are many details that need to be considered.
---
I do will say that supposedly a patch was implemented to prevent people from taming Deathclaws &amp; Mega sloths, among other creatures, I remember reading posts of people claiming g that it was still possible to do so (supposedly, that‚Äôs where the Wasteland Whisperer perk comes in).
---
If all else fails, just make a CAMP around Whitespring Resort, where the robots there can take of handling attackers. Just be aware that people like nuking that area due to the abundance of ghouls that can be turned into glowing ones.
---
I sell ammo for 1 cap. Maybe I charge 2 caps for gauss rifle ammo but everything else is cheap. Ive never had anything priced over 1500. 
---
It‚Äôs at the point where I might just drop all my plans, nobody wants to buy jet pack or ultracite plans and I‚Äôm selling them for 500
---
Genius
---
There's also a bucket of golf balls(and more lying around the bucket) at Ohio River Adventures on the rocks by the water. 18, I believe.
---
They sell for 5 caps though..
---
Cuz they're evil, the cause of almost all the evil, and all dead due to evilness.
---
The best stories rely on having the best villains....who is Batman without the Joker?
---
Stay safe (-:
---
What other people said. Also, do keep in mind that turrets and defensive items take up a ridiculous amount of your camp budget. Generally it's just better to build in a place where enemies aren't an issue.
---
I am finding myself quite bored with just daily challenges but I know Bethesda is going to be bringing out a lot of new content.
---
Agreed. This sounds miserable, and frankly if I have zero interest in rolling an Alt in this game I never want to ever do Rose‚Äôs storyline ever again. She‚Äôs irritating and not in a ‚Äúlove to hate her‚Äù villain way and they‚Äôre boring fetch quests.
---
For selling:
---
I sell all ammo for 1 cap (2c for 40 mm grenade rounds) and .38 for free.
---
ALL meds 10c and Stims and Rad Away for about 8.
---
Bobbleheads for 90c, but I'm considering dropping the price even more.
---
I price my plans at 20% or more (for the super common stuff) below retail value.
---
I keep weapons either a bit under or a bit over retail (rounding up or down) depending on its versatility/value.
---
I made my vendors easier to find behind my "house".
---
For buying:
---
I will buy all your .308 for 1 cap each.
---
I will buy all your 1 or 2-star legendaries in the 50c to 70c price range (I turn them in for scrip).
---
I am ALWAYS looking out for a black powder bayonet mod.
---
General notes:
---
Thank you to all the people who use Vault Boy cutouts to point the way to your vendors. I was doing that from the start and then realized it was the norm.
---
I shudder to think of what I scrapped, sold off, or recycled for scrip during Fashnacht. I had just started during the "free trial" a week or so beforehand and was level 18 when it started. I did the event as much as I could (over 70 times I think) and was drowning in legendaries. People were even gifting me legendaries since I was a noob (I assume). I kept guns I liked, stashed a bunch, and generally was more worried about item weight over stats or perks.
---
For Beth nothing is impossible XD
---
Then it sounds like these are not your kind of games. I for one enjoy working towards hard to obtain items, working to get better at harder events and meeting new players, helping them and just making things the way I want them to be. To me the grind is just 5 minutes of the session before I go off to help a new player level, or just run events with friends. And through it all I have never paid for atoms or joined Fallout 1st.
---
I basically put all of my ammo at 1cap, this includes nukes and missles. I think fusion cores I throw up for 50 and plasma cores 50. I make a lot of caps pretty easily by selling large amounts of ammo.
---
Building &gt; anything else
---
It‚Äôs a really good spot, I‚Äôm right across from the train station, I don‚Äôt Server jumping until I can find a spot open. But all these server crashes have really messed with my game today
---
This!
---
No a viable solution for console gamers.
---
As a new player I wouldn‚Äôt worry about fortifying atlas, you‚Äôll always be low on scrap when you‚Äôre low level. You‚Äôll still get the community reward for it so no worries. Also fallout 1st is a must have for me but I know not everyone can afford, it‚Äôs a quality of life option in game
---
I think they disapear once nobody has loot left on it. So if you are the only one to tag an enemy and you take the loot the pile will disapear instantly. 
---
That is because the piles are server sided and not client sided.
---
Ugh. Thanks for reminding me of that lore break. üòñ
---
Ya her quests are really an advanced tutorial for some things. Not really fun story. I like her quips but ya doing her quests again is not appealing in the slightest.
---
Truth be told I'm rather curious about this group coming to Appalachia, the title of the next DLC is intriguing. Maybe this group doesn't like how the West coast BoS is shaping out and want to start fresh with the excuse of looking to deal with the Scorched Plague just being a cover.
---
Lol "No one is gonna care if they aren't ash piles", have you met the roleplay community?
---
Been kicked off the server three times in the last hour. Wtf?!
---
Sir, this is a Slocum‚Äôs Joe
---
Its been absolutely horrible the past few weeks. It used to happen occasionally, now i cant fast travel at all without moving a few steps 6 or 7 times. Every single time. 
---
Just remove the count down timer. This never happened before that mechanic was implemented
---
I have 8558 steel
---
936 concrete 
---
800 cork
---
16 plastic.
---
what can I say, I run shotgun.   
---
so probably hoarding concrete untill cork and plastic days then wood leather then glass.
---
That advantage would last till level 30. Could max out a build with a bunch of perks by then. It already possible to max your build by level 50, lowering it any further would be counter intuitive to the mmo loop. 
---
I played the other fallouts aswell and this is a different story. It‚Äôs definitely an mmo first rpg second. Unless they can pump out more engaging story content they need these other RNG loops to keep people logging in. Before wastelanders dropped, the endgame content was vendor hopping, camp building and SBQ for levels and drops. In mmos the story is secondary to gearing your character and getting stronger.
---
Not sure why you were downvoted. So i upvoted you. between your comment and everyone else it makes a lot more sense why i should probably seek out something high an increased fire rate.thanks everyone
---
I'm down to adopt a wastelander I'm on PS4 robotic-seaboard either send me a message here or on PS chat
---
Same here I just gave up.
---
Happened to me last night on PS4 for the first time
---
I just came cane back to the game this year after spending probably about 40 hours with the game on release. Game Pass helped so I actually had some buddies to play with. I originally quit playing when I got to Rose‚Äôs quests. I did a few and stopped playing. I was pleased the rest of the main story was a lot better and I‚Äôm enjoying the wastelander content.
---
It was a trip to come back to the game and see actual living NPCs.
---
Some vendors have stock that they have listed deliberately at a high price so on the map it looks like they have a lot of wares, but realistically they don‚Äôt want you to buy it so it draws in more potential people.
---
And then there‚Äôs people that don‚Äôt know/care about the value of items, example I sell all my legendaries under 300 caps, I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs ultra rare I want it gone :P
---
I heard they're faulty. Now Van Horn, they're the real deal.
---
Yep. It hurts. It has only happened to me once and the pain was real.
---
Guess i know where i‚Äôm going for a good cry so nobody can hear me, brotherhood of steel observatory
---
Found about 70 stimpacks in there one time. Now I check every time and occasionally drop some stuff
---
My friend from CA told me it was on sale last month. I\`m unfortunately one of the poor souls who thrown 40+ bucks into Beth\`s voracious maw hoping they gonna keep their promises, enable modding and release editor :).
---
I would help you but I‚Äôm on PS4.  I wasn‚Äôt able to get anyone to help me, but joining events like scorched earth may help.  Since asking for help I‚Äôve probably revived about 10-15 people lol
---
Oh yah game is fun as hell now. But after a while you realize how handcuffed the endgame is just for the sake of coming back. I get it but I have more i want to do and improve. But I'm done doing all daily activities in like 45 minutes. I would play so much more and buy more atoms if I could accomplish more towards my goal in one day. So I'm on a break for another couple months
---
You just inspired me.  I put around 1000 .308 rounds for sale for 1 cap.  They sold out in around 3 minutes.
---
So you‚Äôre admitting to scamming? Lol
---
Edit: damnit didn‚Äôt mean scamming, stealing
---
This was an epic gamer move
---
I'm not sure anybody has ever timed it, but 5 minutes seems to be a good safety margin.
---
I too have been kicked from my private world after dropping stuff off for an alt. character. Luckily it was just junk legendary items because my main had maxed out for the day. I was even really upset. I now have a 2nd account that I got for free, so I shouldn't loose anything ever again. 
---
If your friend's game crashes while you are offline, they will not be able to return to your private world. For their benefit, I'd recommend you just afk while they play.
---
What do you all sell land at?
---
Nice. XD
---
Plans!
---
It doesn't matter who donates what, if a goal is achieved the rewards are available to everyone.
---
Three times? Whats wrong with Bethesda in the last Days? The Crashes seen to get really worse in the last Time. My worst was last weak with 4 in a Row.
---
And how tf did you know he was selling stuff for $?
---
I can‚Äôt wait either but quick question when is this happening or the Atlas community challenges cause I see everyone posting about it and I kinda forgot the date.
---
Imagine a questline dealing with all that. Not just a corpsepile. But you do have an interesting perspective :)
---
I‚Äôve tried to play over the last couple hours. Was booted off about nine times. Glad to here it‚Äôs not just me.
---
This comment needs to be more visible
---
That would actually be awesome if sellers *could* do that.  Get rid of ammo we don't need for less than 1 cap per.
---
"What bug? Also, have you seen the cool new free icon we have for you in the Atomic shop?!?!"
---
\- Love, Bethesda
---
All sorts of shit wrong with this. I don‚Äôt condone duping. But you don‚Äôt know they were trading for cash. Maybe he was gifting them to his mule or girlfriend. Maybe he traded a lucky roll from the purveyor for the gifts. He might have found gifts on the ground (I have). Point is you really had no idea what those two people were doing.
---
How is that scamming? I‚Äôm not offering anything or making trades and then reneging on my promise. These are duped items. How do you have 5000 large christmas gifts your just going to drop for someone? Probably should trade it and not drop it.
---
Except duping involved using vending in a way that was a bug. This is you using blueprinting the normal way to blueprint something bethesda forgot to lock out of blueprinting. That's not a bug and thus it's not an exploit.
---
Being a bush wookie gets boring.   I have been playing it offensively but at this point I am just getting tired of the mode.  I am at level 95 and want to reach level 100 to unlock the hellfire power armor paint.  I've been playing the mode as intended, killing players here and there, but at this point I am tired  of NW and just want my damn power armor paint so I might go back to being a bush wookie until I reach level 100.  When I bush wookie I turn off the team fill though.
---
Honestly I was unsure about how the game would play when I started, but the community‚Äôs actually fantastic. I‚Äôm used to games like GTA where everyone kills you for no reason but that‚Äôs one thing I really like about this game.
---
The way I see it my vendors are a way of getting rid of things, as to the poster's point.  I laugh when I visit a camp with 150+ plans (majority wall mounts) at 50 caps per...on to  the next...
---
apparently
---
Energy Weapon durability is fine for non-legacy guns, or maybe just heavies.  I rock a B25 UGL all day firing tens of thousands of rounds before I have to repair.
---
Good job amigo. Keep an eye on RnG station. Its pretty desolate even tho foundation is there, so ive seen quite a few shady deals goin on there. I almost nabbed myself a quad tesla rifle.
---
It was easier when the market was trading 5.56 for caps. Since duping hit the economy hard, people quit trading 5.56. They still worth 1/1 though. I've sold 70,000 in the last month.
---
Welcome dweller! F76 is quite a simple game and the community here will allways be helpful if you have any questions.
---
I will let you know that April 4 we will have update 21 wich will bring a new endgame boss, the Wendigo Colossus; as well as legendary perks and a few fixes. On April 8 we will have a massive community challenge called Fortifying Atlas. We will help prepare the arrival of the Brotherhood by donating several resources to the Atlas observatory. 
---
Fallout 1st is a subcription service wich gives you several benefits such as: 1650 atmos each month, access to the scrapbox (unlimited scrap storage), the sourvival tent (a free fast travel point), and private servers (a good way to get loot or farm resources without other people). What I found most useful about F1st is the scrapbox since junk is so important. Also I really enjoy buying cosmetics with the atoms. I recomend you buying it if you will play most days or every day, otherwise its too expensive. You can pay for it each month of for a full year at a cheaper price. 
---
If you have any questions feel free to ask me or the subreddit.
---
Is it primed 556?
---
It's still recommended that you get a booster shot if you're suspected of getting tetanus.  And after wastelanders, some time is supposed to have passed.
---
People should have the option though.
---
Zombies, lol!!!!
---
Fair point.
---
Why don't you get a proxy to play the game for you.  Then you don't have do the grind of getting the rarest items in the game, but can still show off like you did.  What you gonna complain about next i wonder?
---
I don‚Äôt think there have been any nerfs. It‚Äôs all about perk cards
---
Does anyone have any recommendations for non-1st players on how to manage their weights? I'd love to stock up on as much as possible, but I don't exactly wanna pick up 1st JUST for this event. (I'm still considering it, but I'm on the fence.)
---
It‚Äôs the bounties and slap damage that deter people, people are still as shitty as ever given the chance lol
---
.... your words not mine.
---
Maybe down the line they'll add something like that if enough people request it, who knows though
---
Hell some days I don't even charge for ammo at all.
---
It sounds like you are in a high level region before you are ready. 
---
Stay in the forest. Enemies are level capped there. Once you feel comfortable explore the ash heap and toxic valley. Don‚Äôt go to the savage divide until you are ready to take on high level enemies.
---
Roger Wilco!!
---
I'm suggesting the sandbag because the extra projectile likes to wander
---
Played 3 hours... zero disconnects. 
---
I wonder why some people still have issues and others don‚Äôt.
---
Thank the dupers for ruining our chance of trading this stuff
---
Anyone remember having to mod these exact things out of Oblivion for the same reason?
---
I used to dominate with a gatling gun and power armor. I got to rank 131 when this released. The accuracy is definitely much worse. And I absolutely know the crossbow accuracy was nerfed because third person used to only show a dot when aiming, it no longer has such amazing accuracy. Maybe I am mistaken.
---
Same, had three CTD‚Äòs within the last hour alone (on PC too). Somethings up
---
You're probably in the wrong part of the world.  Enemies are level capped depending on your region.  In general, stick to the west side of the map, stay away from the east side.
---
Level up in the Forest (1-10), maybe Toxic Valley (10-25) if you are above 20.  Move on to Ash Heap (25-35) if Toxic Valley is too easy.
---
Savage Divide (15-99) is a no go, Mire (30-99) more so, and Cranberry Bog (35-99) is a death sentence.
---
I can't upvote this enough.
---
I give away ammo for free. Only thing I sell are plans, they always go for 10% of the base price.
---
Plasm? I don‚Äôt think so. Gaus shotguns are though.
---
I don't believe so.   I've seen people on this sub say that blue suitcases last the longest.   Which leads me to believe they all reset every so often depending how they are programmed.
---
I‚Äôve had my suspicions since WL began that the crossbow now pulls off a bow for the damage perk in NW, which I‚Äôm pretty sure we don‚Äôt have.  I do feel it‚Äôs different now, though still highly useful.  I run as a rifle spec bush wookie.
---
Yes, it can help you qualify. multiply the fire rate by # of projectiles (5). If it is 200 or greater, it will deal magic damage.
---
I thought they didn't disappear only if another player hit them and can loot. I honestly never stuck around long enough to find out.
---
Yeah I've never seen an empty goo/ash pile
---
To me it was a brand new game. Preordered the game and played the BETA. And God was it BAD! Serious hot garbage. I just considered it lost money and moved on. Then one day I heard about the game's first massive DLC with NPCs. 
---
So of course I installed the game and gave it another shot... I have played it almost every day since the release of Wastelanders. I really enjoy the game and what it has become in spite of all the bugs and issues.
---
Meanwhile I'm selling purified water for 2 caps each. Economy is hard, man.
---
could be sneaking/crouched 
---
And 24 is max.
---
Gave him a sliver, close enough :)
---
Thank you so much. I mostly use photo mode and hardly ever use the prosnap.
---
My thoughts exactly on the entire matter. If the bug is there okay why isn't actually giving the points for the score that it's saying is completed... unless they simply don't care in the hopes that people will spend money to buy the levels they missed out on
---
Thanks Dude
---
No change. The mob spawns depend on where the players, the queen and any tents are standing.
---
The nuke zone only serves to promote any NPCs spawning inside to being able to drop Flux components.
---
I watched a three star legendary get sucked straight down to hell last night.   Didn't even bother checking.   Sometimes you just know it's gone.
---
Some people are putting them in for lower levels, some people rock bloodied.38 fixers. They have uses
---
You will buy them and you will like it
---
I usually don‚Äôt. I only am for the challenges so people can complete their challenge. Wish it work for 0 caps but it doesn‚Äôt seem too. I don‚Äôt charge for fusion cores. Those I give to low levels in PA. I only keep enough for me which is a minimum.
---
Kill Settlers, Raiders and Blood Eagles for more stims than you'll need
---
Sure!
---
I buy .38 ammo all the time.
---
Nobody rocks bloodied .38 fixers. Low levels don't waste caps on .38 ammo, it is everywhere.
---
They put it there to make you think they have 10000 rounds of good ammo to attract you to their shop, then when you get there it is all .44 and .38
---
I was at my camp and a guy shows up and bought 3000 caps worth of stuff and returned it right away. I was absolutely thrilled and shocked at the same time.  If your seeing this 12_tacos on PC, THANK YOU!! I spent alot of it on mounted head plans and a couple really nice gatling lasers, but I am paying it forward to some new players also!
---
I don't like having multiple characters. Don't really have a need for one as I don't hoard anything and have most of what I want.
---
Ark or DayZ or if on PC then 7 Days To Die are better choices and solo playing Long Dark.
---
I like her more than the guys. I have the wasteland wanderer, just because she looks like Piper in the goggles and newscap
---
They probably could up the limit but building would be hard work at less than 10 fps.

I tried to build a vault earlier today, and the layout was great but it was literally completely empty since I ran out of budget. Ended up scrapping it but it would‚Äôve ended up cool if I could actually furnish it
---
Junkies
---
Yeah but that's what I'm trying to say...now that they're coming back bethesda can make something up for them to have this...like meeting the ss and trading with them or something..
---
I've played with multiple people with .38 bloodied fixers actually, meager damage loss with highly available ammo
---
People sell whatever they want to sell
---
But what is full health? Full health when you have 80% rads or full health like 100%? But what about disease, or something like running into a firecracker berry mid fight?
---
I am not disagreeing with you, but not sure maintaining 100% health all the time is the way to go. Gotta be something like that they can do though. Additional health or stats for every 50-100 DR after a certain DR rating? Because if you are building like that, then clearly you wanna tank, so make gear built to tank in. Even better, make it exclusively a PA stat so PA can be great again.
---
Nope. Probably an ultracite laser? High fire rate, and glowing green bolts?
---
They're only obtainable from hacking terminals.
---
i didn't realise i was catering to only you. Sorry.
---
Ok.
---
Preaching to the choir bruh
---
I gain money so quickly and the cap is only 30k. It is a waste to sell them for any more.
---
Who are you?
---
No, I'm ghosting through the doors and I'm not waiting for you to play with Mainframe cores for 30 minutes. I'm launching now
---
If that was possible, a treasure hunt using riddles would be fun.
---
They did nerf the gatling gun, both the to fire rate, and reducing accuracy at med+ range.
---
The X-bow pulls off of semi-auto rifle perks still, I haven't noticed any difference in it. Even unperked it still 2-shots players.
---
Oh I missed the part of the roadmap that said they would make one shotting legendarys the new meta
---
It had the option for a vendor and I got excited to place the singing robot in the center of morgantown, alas - no dice. Also just adding one to an existing set would be pretty sneaky, especially if you don't open a nearby crate.
---
I'm pretty sure there are FO76 haters that have scripted downvotes on the entire subreddit, I wouldn't worry about it.
---
Yes but if you read the level 100 description it says that it includes the dark matter PA, 500 atoms, the planetarium lamp, the jangles beer stein and the framed game board
---
I‚Äôm ps4 so...
---
I got him to reset on a Sunday. Now I always buy on a Sunday. Placebo effect. Who knows.
---
Bloodied heavy power armor is as close to a tank as you‚Äôll get. High damage, high resistance. The only issue is the bloodied bit.
---
Power fist is the most powerful because it has armor penetration options. Before y'all tell me about DCG, that passive armor pen wasn't in Fallout 4 or 76.
---
Not only is Super Sledge slower and suffers from a lower damage cap, it also creates sound when attacking which prevents you from chaining sneak attacks. Because of this, it's not a very valuable 2H weapon.
---
Well aren't you just the cup of bitchyness
---
I see, I suspected as much. This game mode is not worth playing then. I am not going to repsec my character a fourth time. I really liked that build. So far since I made this thread my experience is that people with frog legs and explosives still run this game. It's really sad to see. I'm already fed up with it.
---
Maxed animal friend gives you the ability to take animals and send em to your camp
---
It‚Äôs been like this for quite a few days/weeks now
---
Yeah I liked her story the best, but her constant complaining about reoccurring nightmares is too much.  Sorry SpaceLady‚Ñ¢, I'm shacking up with MusicLady‚Ñ¢ now.
---
I think the problem is that you start running out of things to actually cause to the player.  Tetanus makes you seize up, IIRC.  So what, you get it and then you cant do anything for 5 seconds and die?  So much fun.
---
It depends the rarer the ammo the higher the price mine will never go over 4 caps tho
---
I play Rust and Ark pretty regularly for the PVP survival rush. If this community couldn‚Äôt cope with losing some junk and aid upon death, they can‚Äôt cope with survival servers.
---
Well someone had to make a complain post this hour.
---
You're name is a bit of an oxymoron.  I cant tell if you're doom guy or Judas Priest.  Regardless, I love it.
---
Yeah I didn't thought about that. Rad-tetanus then xD?
---
Sometimes I spawn in Morgantown or Flatwoods main city and immediately find a spot it looks like one could exist place it and hop in. Its usually as effective as bush camping for when you have no bush
---
That would be cool.
---
That's just gameplay. A message in the top left hand corners tells you the scorched beast threat is over when you kill her.
---
Saw a camp selling about 400 2mm EC ammo for 10 caps, and about 50 missiles for 30. Also had a ton of Rad Away for 25 caps, Stimpaks for 50. No wonder people are complaining about stash limits! Also saw a camp with five or six weathersd asylum uniforms for 5000 caps each; you can find five of those in the asylum!
---
Ain't nothing wrong with a little .38.  I can't believe how bad you got burned though.....like dayum son!!  You got GOT by that expert level insult!!
---
I use furious right now but I'm holding out hope to get a two shot. I feel like a two would unleash devastating damage when combined with the demolition expert perk. if the game calculates the damage correctly your looking at 20%-60% increase to damage each time a round hits the target. The furious effect only inceases by 5% after each successive hit and caps at 50% I believe(please correct me if I'm wrong). Base damage for a level 50 plain gauss minigun is 58 I do not have a two shot version so I'm not sure of the base damage for that weapon. With just level 1 DE perk thats 11(rounded down) additional damage per hit. After 5 hits your looking at 55x2(two shot effect) so thats 110 additional damage total. With the furious effect its only 3, 6, 9, 12, 15(rounded up) additional damage per hit so assuming you hit the target 5 consecutive times thats only 45 total additional damage. Like I said I don't have a two shot yet so I can't confirm this 100% but my math is sound.
---
Doubtful. Bethesda games have never been about gunplay, which is why Nuclear Winter kinda sucks.
---
you don't fucking say. I mean this should be in the game already
---
Scrap it and request a refund for it. It's a broken product.
---
Does the stuff disappear when you log out?
---
I mean, health, ap, movement, what more can you not let the player do?  Rabies can decrease your intelligence?
---
Imagine everything going to hell in a handbasket as a Mandelbrot set, with country roads.
---
I'm hoping my recovery from it is swift. 
---
And my bad for enjoying waltzing around the Wasteland with several FFR/LVC full auto pipe rifles.
---
Mini nukes weigh a ton and no one uses them because the Fatman sucks. Just drop them, your stash will thank you.
---
At fights like the Alpha boss of Paradise I have to sit back and wait to make sure everyone lands a hit, cause when I roll in and start swinging from [hidden] it‚Äôs gonna drop very, very fast.
---
BOS SUCKS HAHA 
---
KEEP SIMPIN' FOR PALADIN RHAMANI
---
I think modus is really the first competent person I've seen in the enclave. He could actually settle order if given support.
---
I can appreciate that it's possible. But if where considering going this route, I'd take a break and re-evaluate my priorities.
---
Counterpoint, why do you need the markers and stuff?  All that is already in the game.  It was a quest, just not one that lead people by the nose.
---
Missiles are 3lbs each and no one uses them anyway. You should just drop them to free up stash space.
---
Not sure that works anymore for vendors but there is no way to select your server on Xbox. So you have to go to the map and left bumper to exit the game to the main menu, then select play and the game will do the rest(put you into a new server).
---
I buy it just to do the purchase from a player challenge.
---
My main account is on steam and my alt account comes from the Bethesda launcher. You can run two copies at the same time that way without any issue. I believe the workaround to run multiple games on one PC was for the Bethesda copy, because you can‚Äôt run multiple steam copies.
---
My favorite thing to see is selling a plan for 3-4 times its value. Things like mounted creatures.
---
As others have more or less already said, I sometimes look and judge.
---
And then they complain about stash limits.
---
High level players don't need 99% of your stuff.
---
&gt;make one shotting legendaries the new meta 
---
&gt;new 
---
Where have you been OP. This isn't new. This has been here since launch smh
---
Don't count on it
---
I think 90% of the bad behavior would be cleaned up if parents followed the age guidelines. Many in the 14 and under crowd tend to incite trouble.
---
Stared doing that yesterday. Player was home, looked in the bag, and gave me the confused emote.
---
What i do is wait for it to become a corpse pile and it will spawn in the location it originally died, helpful since i like using a grenade launcher and pieces fly into orbit sometimes.
---
prolly chillins
---
It depends on my stash limit. After Fasnacht I was overloaded with legendaries. I had close to 300 legendaries and so was constantly at the limit. I couldn't sell a lot of the heavier ammo, but now I am down to only 61 legendaries and am below 600 in my stash. I have a lot more freedom in what I sell now. 
---
I had to make a spreadsheet to tell me the optimal items to scrip to reduce weight and I still just dropped the occasional legendaries. because I was getting so many new ones each day.
---
Nothing better than getting swarmed by glowing ones at whitesprings and not being able to loot the legendary right away only to lose it to an exploding car launching the body into the stratosphere. Seriously, I didn‚Äôt know the Enclave was developing a space program with these vehicles parked near the villas.
---
Yes, fixer is the highest damage dealing ballistic rifle and can be made semi-auto
---
Not until patch 21
---
Maybe you should have done that a long, long time ago.
---
Ooo that's a good one.  I don't think either Wasteland Whisperer or Robotics Expert have that feature, although it would be neat if it did.  Can you imagine being able to reprogram a Sentry Bot and sending it back to guard your camp?
---
Psa: your lootbag despawns after a while. Dropping shit like that isn't safe.
---
If it disappears, don't run here to cry foul
---
&gt; so I chose to take the junk and keep it on me
---
there is your problem...
---
Gonna get myself a Bessie. "MoOoO" if you don't know how to tame animals I can send you a yt link of people explaining it
---
*It's not their junk if they drop it on the ground.*
---
Love it.  It's not a great mmo-like(yet) but it is a fantastic game.  Refreshing to see someone appreciate it as that.
---
Think you'll come back for the updates?
---
And those people are nobodies as well. Funny thing about people is that they always manage to make excuses to hide their true intentions. You know why they are selling so much trash ammo, to be like, well i don't have anything to offer, let me just put this trash up here so it looks like I have something and waste other peoples time.
---
By all means, keep doing it. I have lots of fun nuking camps like this
---
Buy the nuka rocket girl outfit and put it on her. You'll never leave your camp.
---
Yeah this is a common bug. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs best to let the miners roam, really let them *breathe* in the dusty, irradiated Blackwater Mine air before ending their miserable existences. You did the right thing calling people over though so a salute to you, wastelander.
---
No, you are only wasting other people's time, you know, the ones with caps?
---
‚ò∫Ô∏è I always enjoy conversations with people like you. Makes my day seeing petty opinions about what people sell at their camps, if you don't like it don't buy it. Not everyone specifically sets up their vending machines for you btw
---
OP serious thinks he's going to stay logged in on the same server for 2 weeks straight.
---
Yeah, reminds me of my all time favorite fallout character. Mr house.
---
Just go to known mole miner spawns. The ash heap isn't that big to run along killing all of them. Alot have a missile launcher with ammo

I sell all my shotgun shells and 5.56 at 1c each and can't keep them in stock.  Plasma cells and gamma rounds move less frequently, but I still sell them at 1c too.  Before the ammo converter I'd list everything else at 0c to get rid of it, but now I stockpile it.  Once they fix that blasted machine to accept more than a handful of rounds at a time, I'll convert it all to .50 bullets and 5mm.
---
Nah, I'm just someone calling out those scrubs looking to make a quick buck and waste people's time.
---
Damn :/ Thats not all that enticing for me
---
Definitely Fixer.
---
You say this literally 4 hours after I got rid of my 16 pound 3 star fixer I've kept for 2 months because I finally got sick of trying to regulate my stash limit around its godawful weight.  Sigh.  Live and learn.
---
I love when dicks come to my camp to satisfy the challenge of buying 3 thing from another player and then individually buy x 3 .38s for 1 cap each.
---
I see
---
Log out to main menu, sometimes you get a different server, alot of times same one. If you have anyone playing on your friends list you should jump to them . If you have fallout first, being out of your private for ten minutes or more will reset it.
---
How dare you
---
There's perk cards to help with the weight of it. The developers obviously knew people would carry a lot of junk around. It just so happens one problem plus the other incessant issue of crashing that's been pervasive since launch happens to be more painful when mixed. Just losing junk, no problem. Just crashing, whatever. Mix them and you get the worse case scenario.
---
I've had the issue ever since the last big patch where my camp will spawn, but so will the stuff that's naturally in the area. My camp is in the northwest corner of the map just south of WV lumber so i don't have to worry much about other players claiming the spot, but i do have to worry about a tent and fishing nets spawning in my living room.
---
My deepest, sincere, and heartfelt apologies.
---
Veteran players sell all ammo for 1 cap, maybe 2 or 3 for rarer stuff like EC or 40mm rounds. Selling .38 rounds (even for free) is pretty pointless because even low level players end up having too much of it. Ammo (especially explosive ammo) takes up stash space so most people only sell stuff people need (10mm, shotgun shells, 5.56, etc.). Also keep in mind that most players over level 50 probably don't even need ammo anyway since they will have Ammosmith, Super Duper, and Excavator armor, as well as dedicated places to scavenge for ammo mats.
---
Well aren't you just a precious little soul, thinking you can tell people how to play the game.
---
Luckily got two computers so a lot less complicated. Just pushing a button on my KB and one on my mouse while seeing one on my 60 in TV and one on my laptop.
---
Is this about Fallout 76? What zombies?
---
https://eumerch.bethesda.net/games/fallout/?p=7 hopefully this helps a bit, there are some really cool things here. I've picked up a few myself, some things are quite pricey though.
---
Would swear I did Dauguerre's thing there maybe a week ago. Still have to do it on 2 more chars, bet it's brokeüòÇ
---
Seems like a lot of people have raised prices for everything
---
Word of caution: it will NOT be the same server if you accidentally enter a public server, you must exit private and re-enter private without entering any other world in between. Otherwise this is how I do all my mule transfers
---
Fusion cores are super easy to farm from power plants (they have "resource collectors" that make them), and plasma cores are super cheap to make. Since they both weigh so much you're better of just dropping them if you don't need them to free up stash space.
---
Please, continue to tell us how we should be playing. Wouldn't want anyone to not be playing how you them too.
---
True that.  Fix the antiquated engine, then there's room to grow.
---
They better not whine about not having any stash space left then.
---
Her ‚Äúreign of terror‚Äù or whatever literally starts whenever you start the event. She doesn‚Äôt even leave the ground until you launch a nuke
---
Servers are capped at 24 players per.
---
I'll give you that bloodied is overpowered, but at least full health builds don't die in one hit (and can use vampire's and vanguard's and super stimpacks). But you're right in that things could be better balanced.
---
How is this any different? It's locked out of blueprinting, you need to do it in a specific way to bypass that. This is an exploit. I have no clue how somebody can fail to grasp that
---
I had a friend trying to sell nukes and missiles and I had to set them right lol nobody messes with that stuff.
---
Without going bloody or junkie, furious/faster fire/less vats cost is the only gun you‚Äôll need for commando.  Zealots, etc are not necessary.  Furious builds up to +50% damage, although it‚Äôll be rare to use that much ammo on a target.  There‚Äôs a good argument for antiarmor, as well.
---
Aligned mods, reflex sight and perforating mag will further reduce vats cost.  Forceful stock will improve durability and maintain the same vats cost as the aligned version, of weapon degradation is a concern.
---
Well t65 is the secret service power armor. But I can see possible confusion
---
Its about creatures in West Virginia taken control of by a fungus that uses them to spread itself.  Sound familiar?
---
The dupe before last was for anything you could stack, so if someone had two....
---
what are you hoarding so much of that your stash doesnt have room to hold enough junk to repair your gear and or camp?
---
ok, yeah, that's what I was afraid of... disappointing... SOME DAY, I would like to paint my armour something other than grey.  
---
Their wording is poor
---
Last week was the first week I sold to him. I believe it was Wednesday so will he reset Saturday or next Wednesday for me?
---
They're an absolute liability in FO4's robot building expansion. They get stuck in doorways, under ledges, on rocks...
---
Mister Handy will be the way to go for me.
---
Lol... I just put ALL my unused ammo in there.  I don‚Äôt purposely add anything to attract people to my camp.  Every ammo type for 1 cent.  If they want it, they want it.  If they don‚Äôt, they don‚Äôt.
---
I'm pretty sure 90% of players do this. And I don't have a problem with it because it's a stupid challenge.
---
Default Priced vendors are the best amirite
---
He's right. I'd rather spend 50 caps fast traveling to a camp on the other side of the map than pay 2 caps for ammo. You need to learn about Supply and Demand.
---
&gt; That bastard is fierce - he'll go sprinting out of camp after level 62 ghouls and come back a few seconds later.
---
Shame it can't bring the loot back.
---
If the roadmap holds up then I feel like the game would deserve way more people checking it out. 
---
Wastelanders wasn't a fix all for every criticism, but it is a sign that things are going the right direction.
---
OP is saying it‚Äôs the scorched plague basically. It‚Äôs cicadas that are infected with a bacteria
---
I think it has to do with average player level - all these new players, especially on Xbox and PC due to gamepass, lower that average but private world has a controlled average level, usually just yours
---
Why do you need more gear when you are clearly using a duped weapon?  Go buy some more dupes.
---
Depending on where your camp is, there are a number of things you can do to reduce budget.
---
1. Check for stored itemS and blueprints.  Delete them if you can (They take up budget)
---
2. if you till have the crane salvage sign up, but have already done wha needs to be done, take down the sign.
---
3. If you are in the forest, reduce the number of turrets you probably have.
---
4. (subjective) rebuild stuff with the contractor perk equipped.  Some say it does not matter - but it I was able to add more stuff after deleting everything, equipping Contractor2, then rebuilding the same camp in the same spot.
---
5. If you bought the thanksgiving display case from the atom shop, use it instead of the glass cases.  T-giving cases are smaller and hold more (6 items vs 4) so you need fewer of them.
---
6. Try using power radiators or
---
7. remove electric lights and replace with candles or oil lamps (thus eliminating wiring and connectors)
---
This is how parasites work
---
I usually ignore them, there should be an option to disable trade invites.
---
As a bloodied melee build who only uses a .50cal on SBQ, I just put all my ammo from runs into the vending machine for free. The amount of time the ammo converter takes to do anything useful is not worth the time imo.
---
I honestly don't think it's possible.  You should probably delete reddit and move to another town.  You will never live this down, you use .38 broseph.  Eww!!
---
His girlfriend goes to another school so you know he's badass!
---
I see. The fungus from the story is the scorched plague.
---
Got ya. Thank you! Glad I checked before buying
---
Free your stash!
---
Bounties are not accidental and slap damage went away months and months ago , the most toxic people in this game are players who hate anyone interested in pvp and equate them with rascist and child molesters
---
Blue case at WS station sometimes has stuff in it too
---
Definitely. I feel they're definitely making a turnaround for how the people outside of the playerbase view this game. Of course it's never going to please everyone but it is definitely going in the right direction
---
That would be nice.
---
Wow I said definitely a lot
---
If you push it hard, you can get 10k a week. Granted, that‚Äôs with a heck of a lot of farming, but it‚Äôs possible. My team and I personally got a total of nearly 3K today alone, and we only played for about 2 hours.
---
Probably overheated.  My fans always spin on high when playing.  If I ever forget to open the door on my entertainment center to let out excess heat, without fail the console shuts off after 10 minutes or so.  Make sure your console is well ventilated, maybe get a can of compressed air and spray out the dust inside.
---
Definitely
---
Thrill kills?
---
Two shot is only 25% more base damage (2x62.5%), so base damage would be 73/74 I suppose.
---
They added a gauss shotgun that can pretty easily neutralize tubers. It can be pretty fun to run a dedicated shotgun build.
---
For sure, no doubt
---
15 in the nuka machine, I fill that bastard every day or two. At least 10 nukashines, then random nuka cranberry, high voltage here, rad ant lager, I like to mix it up.
---
Unfortunately, yes.
---
There's a ghillie skin for it.
---
This happened to me several times throughout her questline.  A couple of times my progress reset and I had to go fetch something again.  If she doesn't seem to be acknowledging completion of a quest, log out and log back in.  Keep talking to her even if she's repeating past dialogue lines, sometimes the game recognizes progress and increments quest status anyway.
---
If he‚Äôs a fan of real-world versions of the in-game things, there are plenty of people on Etsy that create models of things from the game.  One that I like is https://etsy.me/2URlgtr who makes very good duplicates of the in-game magazines as notebooks. Aside from that there are many other artists that create props of things from the game
---
I suppose it forces you to see other camps. I have seen some pretty cool ones I otherwise would not have.
---
I hate the challenge to build up my camp when I am already at my max budget.
---
Which are those, canceled ones?
---
Assuming that must be on the Board after #76. I guess I missed it.  Sadly Ghillie isn't  exactly a look I care for, but I guess it's better than grey.   I sure would like skins for it. I feel it's ignored by the designers.
---
A lot of cool stuff there :)
---
Fix master flex
---
Stash your important junk. 
---
If it‚Äôs rare, stash it. 
---
If you‚Äôre going to need it soon, stash it.
---
Just because there are perks and gear that reduced the weight of junk in your inventory it give you benefits for carrying junk, you‚Äôre still taking a risk. 
---
Here‚Äôs a [good resource management sheet ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1sg7L4P7UT4mycr7JF-aXvf5gjFtsyAfUH3qjeiV03y8/htmlview) to guide you on how much of what to keep.
---
Hopefully gives you an idea of what to get your brother:)
---
It‚Äôs gotta be something. I used to get so many of them. I think I still have a light machine gun a rocket launcher and that assault rifle. Never any use of them but I never have chance to scrip them because just playing through the day I find enough weapons to scrip for daily limit
---
Scrap box
---
I mentioned the vendor because I collect junk to sell components that most people wouldn't have enough of. It may not be very profitable, but I have made sure to keep a constant supply before it sells out each day, usually all to one person, but now it'll take multiple days to restock on everything I lost to have enough to sell to others.
---
You could get a friend to do you a favour. But I get what u mean.
---
50lb account wide mailbox would be pretty sweet...
---
No loot. Only shoot.
---
They don‚Äôt, not really anyways, most people complain more about the stash space because all it takes is 275 super stims to fill it up completely. I have a few thousand of most commonly used ammo types and it‚Äôs only about 30-35 pounds total.
---
Also, this guy is most likely just upset because he was looking for some of the less common/ more commonly used ones (Fcells, 5.56, .45, .308) and was expecting them to cost the same as other ammo types that are used regularly (just not super commonly) (5mm, 10mm, .50, 2mm, etc)
---
If its not clear they start out hostile but once you do raider quests and increase your rep with them they will go friendly and then you can do two quests there. Others mentioned handing in meat to black eye but also there is another quest at the back you can do daily which can get you a tiny amount of raider rep.
---
You can also talk to bruiser later. He doesnt give you a quest but he will talk to you and tell you about how big and strong he is and where he is from etc.
---
Yeah I found this out when there was like 40 up near raider base. I was like wait what‚Äôs happening then I realized
---
That must have been it - weird that they were bolts and not beams as usual. Thanks!
---
Half of me wants to say it'll get done day 1 when some dupers walk up with a billion of each junk
---
You can get the dumb looking camo for atoms
---
Junk loss is always a pain, but either keep the good scrap in your stash, or think about fallout 1st with the scrapbox
---
I know someone who's over 450, and they made a fresh toon when wastelanders started.
---
Thanks man! It's also my gamertag on PSN, I've had it for years. Never played doom and don't know much Judas priest. Just a name I made like 12 years ago trying to be cool üòÇ
---
LOL agreed, I hate the camo look
---
if youre carrying the junk.. nobody can buy it
---
As a level 20, you really shouldn‚Äôt be in areas that can generate at level 62 creature. 
---
Forest, Toxic Valley and maybe the Ash Heap. 
---
[Read this and look at the map](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9vkwc2/fallout76_zone_map_with_level_ranges/)
---
I was hoping to see something cool but I think it‚Äôs dumb looking. I just put my outfit on so I never see my armor thank god until they give something better then that and the ghille
---
Wow very helpful thanks
---
You missed the hooker update
---
Idk, its a weird bug it happens to me as well. It shouldnt, bodies with looth shouldnt disapear.
---
Ok :/ that‚Äôs annoying. It will take a while with my potato internet, but thanks for the help!
---
Why should anyone care? It‚Äôs just another glorified scorched event. Bethesda‚Äôs big idea to keep everyone entertained until the fall.
---
Nope.  Raiders got this extra, unmarked area with 2 ways to increase rep.  Fishbones starts an unmarked quest to defend against some mirelurks, Blackeye takes Mirelurk meats.  Both reset daily, neither appear in the PipBoy.
---
This shit is unbelievable Fuck it. Don't even want to play the game.
---
I have a strong feeling they'll be nerfing Unyielding in Update 22. It's just too good and too easy to stack, and the downsides can be mitigated heavily because of the +15 SPECIAL bonuses and low-life bonuses like Serendipity and Nerd Rage and Adrenal Reaction.
---
Strong melee damage, sneak, VATS, AP and regen for Dodgy/running, carry weight, conversation checks, XP boosts, dropped item condition boosts, crafted durability boosts, etc. The list goes on and on.
---
Oh dude, try breaking up with her. I immediately went begging her back lol
---
Alas 4 of my 5 characters have a viable endgame build.
---
Building + switching to Events right before an Event finishes then switching back &gt; Building
---
But to be fair, that‚Äôs a little more min-maxing than I care to manage. 
---
Setting it to Building and leaving it there is the easiest option, I‚Äôll agree to that.
---
the problem is that i don't have friends.. lol
---
That's my thought lol
---
AH, so that's why I can't do her missions?  There are a number of reports of not being able to initiate quests.  She just sits there and complains about her shoulder.
---
I got it a couple times and it seemed interesting, but you have to rely on getting it from big crates, which I wouldn't be able to rely on. Either way I am stuck with shotgun, melee or heavy weapons. It really sucks that my favorite weapon was nerfed. I'll just afk the dailies if possible and forget the mode exists.
---
Yeah.... I even take it a step further and wear the Cola Girl outfit simply because the Backpack + Jetpack goes away for a smaller lower jetpack only.
---
Sorry to hear that, it sucks to lose out on so many score.
---
It‚Äôs a static reset Saturday not a 7 days or whatever like vendor and scrip
---
This forum needs a stickied list of known bugs with a date they where verified to exist. Might help to put a little pressure on things.
---
Yeah I use my blue ridge outfit hides all the armor. But I have jet pack but never use it since I had it on the first chest piece I got. It wasn‚Äôt that fun for me and I need deep pocketed more. But I think I‚Äôm going to do it again.
---
I just drop stuff on the ground in front of the white spring station.
---
People here have already proven you wrong.
---
Used to be that Bloodied was dangerous in PvP as well. What defeated it was Strangler poison damage, Junkie's magic damage bug, FO1st scrapbox making UC ammo more common, and of course duped Quantums / Stealth Boys / legacy weapons / etc.
---
Without all of the above working against it, Bloodied is very capable of hitting PvP damage cap with ease, and combined with AP bonuses for Dodgy and always-on Serendipity/Emergency Protocols it becomes the deadliest PvP build.
---
Noooo! Lol you'll get lucky eventually, 2nd place is a handmade so keep an eye out for one of those as well
---
OH I couldn't live without anymore. It pains me to play on Alt without.   Jetpack + Maruspial+BirdBones+ Strange in Numbers = My Jam.  Highly mobile Rifle Crit build.
---
or they would make it a legendary perk
---
10lb mailbox and every rank after ads 5 or 10lb
---
What I know is starting next Tuesday we begin to acquire materials. Based in community success we get specific rewards.
---
I believe BoS arrives in October.
---
If you use the fallout first container transfer you stand a good chance of losing stuff eventually. everyone I know who's doen it has had a server crash while doing it, myself included. totally not worth it.
---
I just got here as well and there‚Äôs no helmet very disappointed the different color suits are cool though
---
Honestly you probably summed it up right there- it was a quick and easy asset flip. They probably figured it wouldn‚Äôt matter that it was T-60 only since the Brotherhood was never supposed to come back until they changed their minds and did Wastelanders
---
I never keep mini nukes i usually stash them in the briefcases at train stations so some low levels can feel like they hit the jackpot lol.
---
Just curious, why non-auto? Chinese stealth build for me and switched to auto from rifle awhile back and would never go back.
---
Sorry man. I dunno why you even got downvoted
---
Don't they turn into meat piles?
---
Ok thanks for advice üòÅ
---
Yeah they do I hear the drop rates are just ridiculously low
---
But they're exactly the same on all characters even though the character tab is supposed to be unique to that character
---
It is definately rng.  I got 4 in a row the other day after having a drought.  I dont know if it works for everyone, but that quest resets for me everytime I server hop. So I will go around and collect 5 or 6 of each part then hop until i run out
---
I have the same bug.  Have the flight recorder data too.   Says so everytime I login.
---
Agree. Adventure mode and survival mode died for me after the first dupe. Now I pretty much only play NW. There's nothing I'd like more than for them to put effort into improving NW.
---
I have my end game auto guns set, B2525 fixer and handmade. But I also have all the rifleman perks so I wanted to mess around with some non auto options too
---
Sharing perks is always handy. But certain ones aren't the best for bloodied build. Like rad sponge, never share that unless you want to piss people off. Charisma perks are usually good, I often see strange in numbers or inspirational
---
Exactly, I see it as more of a "roleplay" event where we are genuinely helping fortify ATLAS for the BoS, as opposed to a content event where we actually have to race to hit these goals.
---
They know how much scrap people have across the playerbase. They know how much the playerbase earns in a 4 day span. These numbers are meant to be hit. They only lose if a number is short and they take away a "reward" from the community.
---
Absolutely share.. always. Just don't share ones that break builds.  Such as ones that remove rads (kills bloodied).  I think many just forget.  I just leave Strange in Numbers always shared... unless someone in Team has it as well, then I share something in the Luck category, such as crit boosting, everyone loves bigger crits.
---
It happens. Still worth it. Just break it down more.
---
Oh I feel you. See when I wanna played when game first came out really didn‚Äôt mess with perk builds other then strength so I could hoard everything. Lol and then stopped played after beating main story and started back again in October. Again build everything around carry so much. So my character with ribeye steak can carry 580. But once I got my bloodied combat I switched from my bloodied melee to commando even tho it was only 2 stars. I loved it and when I got the luckiest three rolls of my life from purveyor. All bloodied and one was my first bloodied fixer. I said screw it I switched every perk around to give it my all. So now I think my jet pack will work good being before I only had 4 agility as to now I have almost 15
---
You sound like a general who can't bear to lose troops. Such do not win battles comrade
---
Yeah Vertiguard PA is an atomic shop item as far as Im aware, none of the future season rewards are in the files yet
---
I have an instigating fixer, handmade, and lever gun.  The lever gun does the most damage.  I usually keep the fixer chambered for .38 and use it or the handmade as my primary (depending on ammo availability) and the .45 for tougher creatures than I want to 1shot.
---
I am not a bloodied build so that might change the calculus, but I would say you want all three.
---
No gatling energy weapons have the cheapest ammo in the game, one fusion core has over 1000 bullets. There needs to be a trade off somewhere.
---
Nice :)  I haven't tried a melee build yet. I have been thinking about doing it. But, then I thought about just waiting till they intro the perk loadouts.  I would rather be able to hotswap perks than change characters.
---
I like sharing Ricochet, just so when the perk activates for, say, a shotgun blast, it startles them as much as it startles me hahaha. That being said, i love the sound, especially in power armor, feel like ironman with bullets flying off me haha
---
I would definitely be cool with earning the BoS paint in-game through reputation things and that‚Äôd def be my ideal outcome, but considering how Bethesda likes locking skins and such behind paywalls or seasons (which isnt a complaint Really, its just a skin) I figured suggesting it as a seasonal incentive might be a decent middleground
---
Not everyone has the points in chr. You need at least 3 and that only allows you to share a lvl 1 perk. Often players dont typically have many lvl 1s that are useful maybe. High level doesnt always mean "well informed" either. Playing in teams is a new thing to a lot of players and the whole concept of sharing perks isnt well explained
---
Maybe because they can? 
---
Nobody said all ammo costs 1cap.  Don‚Äôt be that guy just because you do ‚Äúeveryone else should‚Äù.
---
I'd guess most high levels not sharing perks just don't have the charisma. Or if they've only got 3 CHA, they don't have any rank 1 perks worth sharing.
---
Or maybe they're just lazy.
---
Thank you so much for the information!
---
Oh god I can‚Äôt wait either. Well if you‚Äôre on Xbox and are a bloodied I could trade you a bloodied grognak axe I have 2
---
Sure, what‚Äôs your ign?
---
Yep, just a pain.  You can probably expect 20 or 30 turn-ins per paint.
---
Trying to be cool indeed.
---
Man, I wish I could collect ANY badges....  I‚Äôll try hopping servers tonight and running the same quests.  If I come up empty tonight though, probably gonna give up on the repeatable quests and put my backpack mod dreams on hold.
---
I don‚Äôt share as I don‚Äôt have many in charisma
---
Deep down, I know you're right. 
---
Imma miss you guys.
---
U should put him between the windegos arms
---
Well i dont wanna do that..just want it to work!
---
But that's unrealistic and we all know this game is super realistic.
---
Sure feels like they increased the cool down between public events.
---
Sorry, my power went out in a storm today and still isn‚Äôt back up. What‚Äôs your psn and I‚Äôll add you when I can get back on
---
I don't understand why they would sell it for 5 maybe if it was missles and cannon balls but not for regular rounds.
---
You are ignoring the fact that many, many steam users were forced to play FO76 using the bethesda launcher for 2 years.  Hooray for you if you did, but most people aren't going to switch to steam and lose 2 years worth of gear and progress just because "Steam is Better".    More PC users are on the bethesda launcher.
---
I have trash legendaries and my main incentive for getting good ones isn't to make combat easier, it's to reduce my ammo use.  My main concern with "hard" enemies is "how many bullets will this take?"
---
If the ammo machine wasn't so terrible most of that problem would probably be solved.  I'd rather farm lead than sit clicking through that thing.
---
Every train station seems to have a container that people use.
---
Hell no! All i ever get from SBQ is 1 star junk and i do the event at least 2 or 3 times a day! Nocturnal armor 1 star seems to be all i really get as of lately!üò°
---
The further from the centre or vault, the less traffic you get
---
Now if only she would bathe
---
Because you missed the point
---
I sell what I can sell, but the stash can't hold everything.
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout:_Brotherhood_of_Steel
---
Man I've lost count on how many legendaries I killed and they just disappear. So annoying my god.
---
Online radio is your friend. I'm on Xbox, so use the TuneIn app and listen to things from their 50s category. [This](https://tunein.com/radio/24-7-Dreamboats--Petticoats-s193402/) is the best one I've found so far, there are no adverts and no DJ, it's 100% music-only.
---
I always assumed they killed it to use the servers for FO1st instead
---
There is a reply button isnt there?
---
I try to share.  Sometimes I am oblivious and don't notice that the game has un-shared my perk.  Why isn't it always automatic once I share it? I dunno.  I'm sure there is some good reason...
---
Bait and switch.
---
That is shocking to me. That‚Äôs literally never happened since I‚Äôve been paying attention/cared - since we noticed LITS was bugged
---
Happens all the time on PS4, only thing I found is running a certain distance and trying again.
---
An exploding railway rifle can deliver quite a punch
---
Gather them in small groups.
---
This shit is frustrating.
---
I laugh every time I see it
---
If you are on PC then there is a mod on nexus for doing exactly this.
---
The real question is why does the screaming eagle skin add an optics rail to the gun.....and then still attach your scope/reflex sight to the side of the gun with a piece of angle iron??
---
Some Ppl just put ammo in their vendors as a bait to get ppl in their camp and to just meme around. I had like 80k uc 5mm in my vendor for 25k a pop and like 5 different guys bought one as a joke
---
Lever action rifle.
---
What rolls did you have?
---
I've never encountered it. Is it a console bug? The only thing happens to me (on PC) is waiting some seconds before the travel starts.
---
I'm not but it seems like a simple process. I wish I had a PC more and more each day
---
This micromanagement was like Phase one Wow classic so epic..but yeah I work 12hrs a day.. I read about Fo76 on Reddit more than I play the cursed game
---
Just dont one shot the legendary enemy or you'll get the full toxic wrath of the entire server
---
This.  X100.

You don't have to connect them to a terminal, they cycle through the colors each time they're activated. The first one does have to be connected directly to a power source, though.
---
Yeah that got me. The actual ironsight is pretty dodgy too
---
That feel when I proudly remember sneaking to get the deathclaw egg as a new player
---
I recovered many a nocturnal pipe wrench this way. Good info to share
---
All my ammo, every last type, I sell for 1 cap, EXCEPT for the auto grenades, I make them free, I want them gone quickly but don't want to just drop them. I'd put the .38's for free to help newbies, if only higher levels didn't greedily snap them up. In game name, searaven (PC).
---
So if we already got all the plans from pails there is no gain? This is going to flop. Of course they are just going to reuse old rewards.
---
O.O
---
Can someone explain to me how you share a perk? I don‚Äôt know where you find it or how you do it üôà
---
Uh so I think your PC is haunted. 
---
Okay that, or they‚Äôre secretly testing cross-platform play/voice chat. 
---
Sorry lol I don‚Äôt know anything about how games work so I can‚Äôt give you any real answers ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è this is super weird though. I would feel very unsettled. Still think it‚Äôs ghosts haha.
---
Maybe you need a new username?
---
Freedom is not just for you.
---
They're making a Giant stopper to jam into fissure prime.
---
I prefer to hide on roofs myself, but I do occasionally peak out and take a shot if I see someone standing still for too long!
---
Holy crap! That works! How did you figure that out
---
I wouldn't know, I'm stuck on the fucking recruitment questline because of a glitch.
---
I've been figuring out new features like this LATE. Same with a handful of people I know. Every 3 points of Charisma you can share 1 card(1 star)
---
7 out of 10 camps have her half naked.  For the love of god please put some cloths on her
---
Solar armor.
---
I noticed it happens way more often since few days.
---
My work around is to run a bit farther, outside of your current area, and it will work.
---
You're not really supposed to. They intend on folks buying FO1st..
---
Try talking with someone at the bar then going back to him. That helped me once
---
The community in the game is pretty awesome. There‚Äôll be assholes now and again but they‚Äôre pretty few and far between. 
---
It‚Äôs completely opposite in this sub.
---
Can't tell if sarcasm or being sincere, but thanks!
---
I know this isn't what you want, but I heard removing the healing factor mutation would eliminate the bug. After doing so I haven't had the bug in weeks. And simultaneously my psychotats clap
---
On ESO they do ban you for over reporting the farming bots!
---
Sheer dumb luck and testing afterwards
---
Does this mean a scorch cicada queen is gonna pop out?
---
all my ammo is 1 cap, don't about these mad lads.
---
It sounds like something a 12 year old would say, ngl.
---
.38 rounds are great, they're more than enough calibre to kill just about everything!
---
I've only ever encountered this bug while I was testing out a low health build and unyielding set. If I used a Stimpack the first time I encountered the fast travel bug, I was almost always able to fast travel the next attempt.
---
However, there were a few times that didn't work. It seems like sometimes with a low health build that uses rads to keep the health low, there will be a tiny bit of glitched visible area between where your health and your rads are on the health bar that a Stimpack can't actually heal. I had the bug almost every time I saw that with the health bar. Using something to give yourself a couple rads (candy from Monster Mash worked great) allowed me to fast travel immediately after fixing that bugged area that a Stimpack can't heal (removing the glitched space between the rads and health on the health bar by getting a few more rads).
---
I am normally a full health Junkie and I literally NEVER see this bug while running that build.
---
Hope this helps someone have less frustration while we wait for a fix from Bugthesda.
---
I have also had the xbox menu do this same thing I was sending a msg and the controls were also controlling the game at the same time
---
Don‚Äôt they, unless there is still loot in them for one of the players?
---
I hooked mine up to a terminal and I can pick the colors from it, I had no idea this was even a feature it‚Äôs awesome
---
[..](https://static-cdn.jtvnw.net/emoticons/v1/58765/3.0)
---
I've not seen a difference, people still buy my ammo, every type!
---
I‚Äôve noticed many times at the end of an event when my slow ass gets to the pile, grab my junk after everyone has left and the piles disappear as soon as I get my loot.
---
I‚Äôm on PS4 and I‚Äôm down. 
---
I‚Äôm mostly active between 330am and 530am Eastern with much longer times on my days off (split days, every other week).
---
I‚Äôd be happy to loan space in my junk box to anyone that wants to use it. PM me and I‚Äôll send you my username.
---
I sell like 50+ 100/100 fusion cores for like 10c. Is that too much for them?
---
Oh I was young when I made it, you can judge if ya want, ain't gonna get butt hurt over reddit üòÇ
---
When you are looking at your perk card loadout, go to a card and press the corresponding button (triangle on PS4) to share.
---
I think people do it to avoid the minions she sends out. Granted they are usually really weak and theres no reason to be afraid of them. I guess they maybe a bloodied build.
---
almost as annoying as standing on top of mob spawn points at events..
---
I don't need the space, and they always sell quickly. I wouldn't recommend selling them without F1st though
---
you could always go back to rust
---
I always try to wait till weaker players hit it so I can one shot it after because all my weapons are so powerful but then some dumbass oneshots it when others are still shooting it
---
I have an IE lever that can do around 6k headshot damage.
---
Have you lost anything?
---
I don't get what's so hard about having a pvp on/off option.
---
The highest I go is 3 and that's for like 5 mm and 5.56! Also ultricite ammo might sell higher too!
---
No, it's just funny.
---
I can kill myself in a pond to help you out.  DM me your screen name when you get a chance.
---
I've lost at least 3,000 points.  With me it was always the dailies, which are worth a lot more points. It sucks.
---
throwing them away isn't a smart use. The one time i had it happen to me I lost multiple weapons and plans worth more than max caps. I have friends who help, and that I help. works much better.
---
Had that happening ahem line in the sand ahem right before thism as i tried to make it even easier by placing my twnt on the spawn so they spawn in the center easy xp. But nope people would rather camo the spawns
---
I put my 38, shotgun, missiles and nukes in the overseer chest for new players.  Everything else except 45 and 50 ca,l which I use, goes for 1 cap.
---
And later into loot on the ground anyone can find. Noticed sometimes the meat piles are hard to find though. You can see them with the camera but under the ground or something.
---

---
I agree with this post FO1St method is not always reliable. Other games have this facility.
---
I'm bloodied and the minions don't even affect me. But these guys had full health no rads, and PA on . I was heated.
---
Level 49 and did my first queen recently and was surprised I wasn‚Äôt getting hit that hard, there is no reason to be in hiding
---
Are you on xbox?
---
I didn't know that, thanks
---
whats the fo1st method
---
It wont help make your turrets any stronger, but as a way to maximize their effectiveness, make sure you place some scare crows in a location where your turrets can shoot them. 
---
Enemies will apparently attack your scarecrows first.
---
Okay then theres no excuse. I've rushed the queen with excavator and a chainsaw before.
---
I usually just have walk a bit then it works fine for me.
---
Had a fun bug in that event last night that caused all the scorched to spawn inside the walls, we threw mines all over and tagged everything w/tse shotguns :D almost went up a whole level from that alone
---
You should be able to sell multiple bullets for a cap.
---
Kind of like Destiny's companionship app. It would be called something along the lines of The Vault or Pip-boy something
---
Yep, happening for me too. Just hoping for the bug fix.
---
Keep holding Bethesda accountable, sadly support auto locks any ticket that mentions this, but we need to keep holding them over hot coals for this until they do something to help us!
---
Load into your private server with one character deposit your items in a container log out rejoin into your private again with your different character. More recently it has become unreliable for me as I have had issues ‚Äúfinding world‚Äù but I now have a friend in the private server acting as an anchor for me to rejoin.
---
I could but the buggers run away so I use a quad radium with gun-fu for efficiency on large groups, keeps them in one place.
---
Nope, these Rad Stags just vanish, no meat piles and no loot contents littering the ground.
---
It can happen even hours after reset if you hadn't played the game till then.
---
Agreed!
---
Private server, dump your stuff in a container, usually a larger one at a station. Log off the toon, switch characters, log back into private server, go to location pick up said items.
---
Chem Fiend does the same thing as the perk that increases the effectiveness of radaway.
---
Glad someone else has noticed, a bug then not intended behaviour but likely will not be fixed as low priority or devs are unaware.
---
Naw PS4
---
Plasma cartridges really don't warrant going for more than a cap. They're easy to craft en masse, so I would only sell them for one cap a pop.
---
It can happen hours free as well if this I your first login, last time it happened to me as logging in 3 hours before the reset having not played the previous day, 6 of those dailies auto completed!
---
Unarmed, melee, or strength  bobble + overdrive + fury + glowing meat steak + a tone of other food buffs + whiskey. 3 perks in ninja, 3 in sneak,  2 in mr sandman and 3 in covert operative at night. Stay in sneak. I have hit for 8k on the sbq with bss mole miner gauntlet by stacking all of these
---
They need to make the robots nuclear explosion not randomly the robot 5 miles away thatd be cool
